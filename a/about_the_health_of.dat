5|$|When the Buccaneers {{selected}} University of Miami quarterback Vinny Testaverde first {{overall in}} the 1987 NFL Draft, starting quarterback Steve Young became expendable. He {{was traded to the}} 49ers on April 24, 1987. The 49ers were concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> Joe Montana, and were preparing for the possibility that he might not recover from back surgery. The Buccaneers received 2nd and 4th round draft picks in the trade, picks 50 and 106 overall, which they used to draft University of Miami linebacker Winston Moss and Arizona State wide receiver Bruce Hill. They also received an unspecified amount of cash in the deal. Young would spend the final 13 years of his career with the 49ers, a stint which would help him secure a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Miller scored 49 in the First Test at Brisbane as Australia amassed 8/601, before dismissing Simpson and Hutton as England fell to an innings defeat. A {{knee injury}} forced Miller {{to miss the}} Second Test at the SCG, which England won. Miller {{returned}} for the Third Test at the MCG, but was initially unavailable to bowl due to lingering knee problems. However, upon receiving an inquiry <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> his knee before the match by Prime Minister of Australia Robert Menzies, Miller agreed to try to bowl {{for a short period}} and lift his team. England elected to bat and Miller removed Hutton, Edrich and Compton with his outswinger. He ended up bowling for the entire first session of play and had 3/5 at lunch from nine overs, before finishing at 3/14. England were bowled out for 191. Miller struggled with the bat, scoring six and seven as Frank Tyson's pace saw England inflict a second successive defeat on Australia. Australia needed to win the Fourth Test in Adelaide to keep the series alive. Miller scored 44 and 14 as Australia were bowled out in the second innings to leave England with 94 for victory. Miller made a late burst, removing Edrich, Hutton and Colin Cowdrey in consecutive overs to leave England at 3/18. He then took a difficult catch from Johnston to dismiss Peter May. England were then 4/49 but hung on to win by five wickets and secure the Ashes. It {{was the first time that}} Australia had lost three consecutive Tests since the Bodyline series of 1932–33. Miller made 19 and 28 in the rain-affected draw in the Fifth Test. He ended the series with 167runs at 23.86, his lowest ever at international level, and took 10wickets at 24.30.|$|E

25|$|Two weeks later, at the , Räikkönen {{qualified}} 6th. In the race, he {{opted for}} a one-stop tyre strategy, placing him {{in the second place}} at the closing stages of the Grand Prix. However, during the final few laps, his pace was more than a second slower than those chasing him, including Nico Rosberg and Räikkönen's Lotus teammate Romain Grosjean. With eight laps remaining, Rosberg was able to take over Räikkönen for second. Grosjean then caught up with Räikkönen on the fourth last lap, but was not immediately able to pass him. At this point, the Lotus trackside operations director Alan Permane had a heated radio exchange with Räikkönen, commanding him {{to move out of the}} way. The radio conversation was widely noted in the press, raising questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> his relationship with the team.

Found in Davison's effects were the two suffragette flags, the return stub of her railway ticket to London, her race card, a ticket to a suffragette dance later that day and a diary with appointments for the following week. The King and Queen Mary were present at the race and made enquiries <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> both Jones and Davison. The King later recorded in his diary that it was [...] "a most regrettable and scandalous proceeding"; in her journal the Queen described Davison as a [...] "horrid woman". Jones suffered a concussion and other injuries; he spent the evening of the fourth in London, before returning home the following day.

40|$|Background Beliefs as {{cognitive}} {{components of}} personality indicate {{what we consider}} as true or false and help us to answer questions concerning others, the world surrounding us and situations that we encounter. Beliefs <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> locus <b>of</b> control and their relations with expectations pertaining to therapeutic education seem to be of vital importance {{in the case of}} occurrence of a chronic illness. The aim {{of this paper is to}} verify whether expectations concerning therapeutic education in chronically ill patients demonstrate a relation with beliefs <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> locus <b>of</b> control and whether they vary according to gender, age and health, and to present the results of research that applies the Polish OE- 15 scale for the evaluation of therapeutic education expectations depending on <b>the</b> <b>health</b> condition. Participants and procedure Two hundred and ninety-one persons were examined, including 180 patients and 111 healthy controls (the control group), 187 women and 104 men. The average age of subjects was 45. 71 (SD = 13. 51) years, ranging from 21 to 80 years. The OE- 15 Therapeutic Education Expectations Scale and <b>the</b> Multidimensional <b>Health</b> Locus <b>of</b> Control Scale in versions relevant for patients and healthy controls as well as demographics were used. Results Age, gender and beliefs <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> locus <b>of</b> control are related to expectations of therapeutic education. Conclusions When providing therapeutic education for chronically ill patients, one should assess their expectations and pay attention to patients’ beliefs <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> locus <b>of</b> control...|$|R
