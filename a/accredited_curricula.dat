5000|$|The primary {{physical}} therapy practitioner is the Physical Therapist (PT) who is trained and licensed to examine, evaluate, diagnose and treat impairment, functional limitations and disabilities in patients or clients. Physical therapist education curricula in the United States culminate in a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) degree, but many currently practising PTs hold a Master of Physical Therapy degree, and some still hold a Bachelor's degree. Currently the education programs for {{physical therapy}} have changed. The Master of Physical Therapy and Master of Science in Physical Therapy degrees {{are no longer}} offered, and the entry-level degree is the Doctor of Physical Therapy degree, which typically takes 3 years after completing bachelor's degree. PTs who hold a Masters or bachelors in PT are encouraged to get their DPT because APTA's goal is for all PT's {{to be on a}} doctoral level. WCPT recommends physical therapist entry-level educational programs be based on university or university-level studies, of a minimum of four years, independently validated and <b>accredited.</b> <b>Curricula</b> in the United States are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE). According to CAPTE, as of 2017 there are 31,380 students currently enrolled in 227 accredited PT programs in the United States while 12,945 PTA students are currently enrolled in 331 PTA programs in the United States.

40|$|Skills or function: that's the question? How should {{learning}} outcomes in adult numeracy reflect this dichotomy? In the workshop, two {{different approaches to}} describing {{learning outcomes}} were used to promote a discussion among participants around the role of skills and function within an adult numeracy curriculum. In {{the first part of}} the workshop, participants worked in small groups to analyse some different real life stimulus materials to develop some teaching ideas, then to try to see how these would fit against two models representing the above two approaches for describing learning outcomes. In the second part, participants discussed their experiences looked at the differences and the merits of the two approaches. Background In the past, adult literacy and basic education has mainly been an informal, student focused form of education with no formal accreditation process or system wide curriculum, with students learning reading, writing, mathematical, oral communication and general education skills. But in the 1990 s the pressure of competency based education and training has meant that the Adult Literacy and Basic Education field too has been required to develop accredited curriculum based on competency based learning outcomes. It has been the challenge therefore to develop <b>accredited</b> <b>curricula</b> that try to espouse and maintain th...|$|E
40|$|Tourism is {{relatively}} new but still a very complex industry, which creates the necessity for legal regulations of different relations in tourism. Quite often, the relations are completely new to the existing legislation and legal practice. On the other hand, it {{is relatively}} easy to find appropriate examples for many of them in existing law of obligations, ownership, civil and other laws. The course of Law in Tourism is necessary for educating and training students in order to introduce them to legal disciplines and institutions regulating social relations relevant to tourism industry. It includes relations between a company (entrepreneurs) and the state, relations between companies in tourism industry and tourism service sector and agents with the direct user - a tourist. The aim {{of this paper is to}} attempt to present the updated situation of law courses by analyzing curricula of tourism colleges and faculties in Serbia. Methodology used for data collection is based on desk research with national and international references, mostly from tourism field. Comparison and analysis were mostly used in data processing. The paper consists of two parts. The first part is entitled 'Defining Tourism and Law in Tourism' and the second is 'Representation of Law Courses in <b>Accredited</b> Tourism <b>Curricula</b> at Higher Education Institutions in Serbia'. Based on the curriculum and sylabus analy­sis of tourism higher education institutions, it can be concluded that law courses are inadequately represented with a total of only 3. 8 %...|$|R
40|$|How to best teach coding to {{landscape}} architects? Domain-specific {{approaches to}} teaching computer programming are surprisingly rare. Most computer programming curricula teach skills in a generic way, to be broadly relevant to many people. A rapidly increasing number {{and ways of}} teaching how to code {{to a range of}} skill levels is now available online, usually for free (see Appendix, RICHTEL 2015, GASCA 2014, FRAMPTON 2015, SIMS et al. 2011). Yet in landscape architecture coding is often regarded as too difficult, too resource-intensive, insufficiently relevant to practice, or otherwise peripheral to the core mission of the profession to teach (WESTORT et al. 2013). As a result, fundamentals of coding logic remain largely un-taught in <b>accredited</b> core <b>curricula</b> in the U. S. This paper has three objectives: 1. Offer a landscape architecture-specific approach to teaching introductory computer programming that combines a) landscape parametrics with b) concepts of computer programming logic and c) basic computer graphics. 2. Present a sequence of exercises intended to impart fundamental skills and peak student interest. 3. Showcase student project results that use the approach. A sequence of short programming exercises asks students to define the geometry of elements from the landscape palette – vegetation, landform, water, weather, lighting – and then to modify them using increasingly more advanced and complex coding principles in a modular fashion. The following criteria for successful landscape design software is offered to students as a guide to structuring their software:  Graphically display landscape geometry, such that it is  Interactively editable/modifiable/deformable and  Analysable with accuracy and some precision  Quickly, while being  Easy to lear...|$|R
40|$|During the {{transformation}} of the Hungarian Higher Education System new educational programs were developed on different levels in the agricultural higher education. The levels of the programs are Postsecondary, BSc, MSc and PhD programs. Most curricula required learning information technology on different content and level. These educational programs are <b>accredited</b> and the <b>curricula</b> are very similar in every university. The contents of the computing subject are almost the same on the BSc level. There are 15 BSc, 15 MSc programs in the Hungarian Higher Education System in 2009. The content of the informatics subject are the most important subtopics such as spread sheet and database handling, networking, etc. The professional subjects contain some informatics knowledge, but it depends on the educational program, subjects and professors. In the MSc programs the informatics topics differ by name and content according to the target of the training program. On this level more professional subjects can be found which contain applied informatics knowledge. But we think this is not enough in our education systems so we accredited the agricultural engineer in agricultural informatics and government BSc program. This program started 3 years ago and 5 Hungarian Universities offer this training program in 2009. The subject group of basic informatics has 36 credits and applied agricultural informatics subjects need 29 credits. It means that the rate of informatics and specialized informatics knowledge is more than 30...|$|R
40|$|Left field” implies {{something}} far from mainstream. In forest {{and natural resources}} education, biophysical science is the mainstream discipline. Biophysical sciences provide the knowledge to achieve desired forest and natural resource management goals. But an education that prepares students for successful careers must also provide understanding of {{the social context of}} forestry and natural resources management. Social sciences and humanities are out— standing in the left field of forestry. A preliminary analysis of one hundred and eighteen <b>accredited</b> undergraduate forestry <b>curricula</b> at forty-four institutions revealed that there are few upper division requirements in the social sciences and humanities. Sixty one percent of curricula require only one or two courses, usually in economics and/or policy. Just one fourth of curricula require an upper division course in the humanities. Law, history, ethics, conflict management, sociology, and human dimensions are relevant topics that encompass the broader context of forestry and natural resources; but courses in these topics are seldom required. To further investigate, I researched the upper division requirements in undergraduate curricula in both forestry and in natural resources management programs. I analyzed course and credit requirements in the categories of biophysical science, social science, mathematics, humanities, management, and communications. A comparison of ninety three forestry curricula and seventy four natural resources management curricula revealed small differences in the ranges of requirements across categories. More notable differences were observed when comparing the mean number of courses or credits {{as a percentage of the}} upper division. Natural resources management programs showed greater percentages in the humanities and communication categories. Still, social science and humanities requirements are slight relative to biophysical science requirements. Undergraduate education in natural resources should embrace the variety of disciplines rather than designating some to left field. It is not only knowledge from biophysical science, but also from other disciplines that will empower forest and natural resource managers deal with people and grow into leaders with broader visions of their professional and societal roles...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} {{of a series of}} internationally published, peer reviewed, journal and conference research papers that analyse the educational and training needs of undergraduate Information Technology (IT) students within the area of Computer and Network Technology (CNT) Education. Research by Maj et al has found that <b>accredited</b> computing science <b>curricula</b> can fail to meet the expectations of employers in the field of CNT: “It was found that none of these students could perform first line maintenance on a Personal Computer (PC) to a professional standard with due regard to safety, both to themselves and the equipment. Neither could they install communication cards, cables and network operating system or manage a population of networked PCs to an acceptable commercial standard without further extensive training. It is noteworthy that none of the students interviewed had ever opened a PC. It is significant that all those interviewed for this study had successfully completed all the units on computer architecture and communication engineering 2 ̆ 2 (Maj, Robbins, Shaw, 2 ̆ 6 Duley, 1998). The students 2 ̆ 7 curricula at that time lacked units in which they gained hands-on experience in modern PC hardware or networking skills. This was despite the fact that their computing science course was level one accredited, the highest accreditation level offered by the Australian Computer Society (ACS). The results of the initial survey in Western Australia led to the introduction of two new units within the Computing Science Degree at Edith Cowan University (ECU), Computer Installation 2 ̆ 6 Maintenance (CIM) and Network Installation 2 ̆ 6 Maintenance (NIM) (Maj, Fetherston, Charlesworth, 2 ̆ 6 Robbins, 1998). Uniquely within an Australian university context these new syllabi require students to work on real equipment. Such experience excludes digital circuit investigation, which is still a recommended approach by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for computer architecture units (ACM, 2001, p. 97). Instead, the CIM unit employs a top-down approach based initially upon students 2 ̆ 7 everyday experiences, which is more in accordance with constructivist educational theory and practice. These papers propose an alternate model of IT education that helps to accommodate the educational and vocational needs of IT students in the context of continual rapid changes and developments in technology. The ACM have recognised the need for variation noting that: 2 ̆ 2 There are many effective ways to organize a curriculum even for a particular set of goals and objectives 2 ̆ 2 (Tucker et al., 1991, p. 70). A possible major contribution to new knowledge of these papers relates to how high level abstract bandwidth (B-Node) models may contribute to the understanding of why and how computer and networking technology systems have developed over time. Because these models are de-coupled from the underlying technology, which is subject to rapid change, these models may help to future-proof student knowledge and understanding of the ongoing and future development of computer and networking systems. The de-coupling is achieved through abstraction based upon bandwidth or throughput rather than the specific implementation of the underlying technologies. One of the underlying problems is that computing systems tend to change faster than the ability of most educational institutions to respond. Abstraction and the use of B-Node models could help educational models to more quickly respond to changes in the field, and can also help to introduce an element of future-proofing in the education of IT students. The importance of abstraction has been noted by the ACM who state that: 2 ̆ 2 Levels of Abstraction: the nature and use of abstraction in computing; the use of abstraction in managing complexity, structuring systems, hiding details, and capturing recurring patterns; the ability to represent an entity or system by abstractions having different levels of detail and specificity 2 ̆ 2 (ACM, 1991 b). Bloom et al note the importance of abstraction, listing under a heading of: “Knowledge of the universals and abstractions in a field” the objective: 2 ̆ 2 Knowledge of the major schemes and patterns by which phenomena and ideas arc organized. These are large structures, theories, and generalizations which dominate a subject or field or problems. These are the highest levels of abstraction and complexity 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 (Bloom, Engelhart, Furst, Hill, 2 ̆ 6 Krathwohl, 1956, p. 203). Abstractions can be applied to computer and networking technology to help provide students with common fundamental concepts regardless of the particular underlying technological implementation to help avoid the rapid redundancy of a detailed knowledge of modem computer and networking technology implementation and hands-on skills acquisition. Again the ACM note that: “Enduring computing concepts include ideas that transcend any specific vendor, package or skill set [...] . While skills are fleeting, fundamental concepts are enduring and provide long lasting benefits to students, critically important in a rapidly changing discipline 2 ̆ 2 (ACM, 2001, p. 70) These abstractions can also be reinforced by experiential learning to commercial practices. In this context, the other possibly major contribution of new knowledge provided by this thesis is an efficient, scalable and flexible model for assessing hands-on skills and understanding of IT students. This is a form of Competency-Based Assessment (CBA), which has been successfully tested as part of this research and subsequently implemented at ECU. This is the first time within this field that this specific type of research has been undertaken within the university sector within Australia. Hands-on experience and understanding can become outdated hence the need for future proofing provided via B-Nodes models. The three major research questions of this study are: •Is it possible to develop a new, high level abstraction model for use in CNT education? •Is it possible to have CNT curricula that are more directly relevant to both student and employer expectations without suffering from rapid obsolescence? •Can WI effective, efficient and meaningful assessment be undertaken to test students 2 ̆ 7 hands-on skills and understandings? The ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SJGCOMM) workshop report on Computer Networking, Curriculum Designs and Educational Challenges, note a list of teaching approaches: 2 ̆ 2 [...] . the more 2 ̆ 7 hands-on 2 ̆ 7 laboratory approach versus the more traditional in-class lecture-based approach; the bottom-up approach towards subject matter verus the top-down approach 2 ̆ 2 (Kurose, Leibeherr, Ostermann, 2 ̆ 6 Ott-Boisseau, 2002, para 1). Bandwidth considerations are approached from the PC hardware level and at each of the seven layers of the International Standards Organisation (ISO) Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model. It is believed that this research is of significance to computing education. However, further research is needed...|$|R
