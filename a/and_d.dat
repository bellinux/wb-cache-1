40|$|The {{impact of}} commencing or {{changing}} antiplatelet therapy on von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) and von Willebrand factor propeptide (VWF:Ag II) levels {{has not been}} comprehensively assessed following TIA or ischaemic stroke. In this pilot, longitudinal, observational analytical study, VWF:Ag and VWF:Ag II levels were simultaneously quantified in platelet poor plasma by ELISA in patients within 4 weeks of TIA or ischaemic stroke (baseline), and then 14 days (14 <b>d)</b> <b>and</b> > 90 days (90 d) after altering antiplatelet therapy. Ninety-one patients were recruited.

40|$|We generalize our {{analysis}} in [arXiv: 1301. 1977], {{and show that}} a 5 <b>d</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>d</b> AGT corre-spondence for SU(N) – which essentially relates the relevant 5 <b>d</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>d</b> Nekrasov instanton partition functions to the integrable representations of a q-deformed and elliptic affine WN-algebra – can be derived, purely physically, from the principle that the spacetime BPS spectra of string-dual M-theory compactifications ought to be equivalent. Via an appropriate defect, we also derive a “fully-ramified ” version of the 5 <b>d</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>d</b> AGT correspondence where inte-grable representations of a quantum and elliptic affine SU(N) -algebra at the critical level appear on the 2 <b>d</b> side, <b>and</b> argue that the relevant “fully-ramified ” 5 <b>d</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>d</b> Nekrasov instanton partition functions are simultaneous eigenfunctions of commuting operators which define relativistic and elliptized integrable systems.
