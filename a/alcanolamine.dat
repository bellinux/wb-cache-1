40|$|OraleCarbon Capture and Storage (CCS) {{is one of}} {{the main}} options for carbon dioxide mitigation. Capture {{processes}} based on CO 2 dissolution in <b>alcanolamine</b> solutions are considered among the most adequate methods for decarbonation of post-combustion effluents 1. However, the energetic costs of avoided CO 2 must be significantly reduced before process integration into industrial sites. The understanding of molecular interactions involved in {CO 2 +water+alcanolamine} systems is essential for optimizing gas dissolution and reducing process cost. The aim of this presentation is to compare thermodynamic properties of {alcanolmine+water} mixtures obtained experimentally and from molecular simulations. Molecular simulation provides a detailed microscopic view into thermodynamics and transport properties and is complementary to experimental measurements. Simulation is also a promising tool for the prediction of properties required to design capture process. The insights into microscopic structure and energetics of {alcanolamine+water} mixtures obtained from simulation, such as differences in hydrogen-bond interactions between different alcanolamines, contribute to improve structure-property relationships. A force field adapted to describe alkanolamines containing the N-C-C-O backbone 2 was developed, taking into account the polar environment. This new force field was validated through to prediction of enthalpic and volumetric properties of seven alcanolamines, which are methyl- and ethyl-substituted monoethanolamine (MEA). The force field was then used to calculate the enthalpy of mixing alcanolamines with water. Results are compared to experimental data obtained using mixing calorimetry using both flow mixing and titration calorimeters. (1) Arcis, H.; Ballerat-Busserolles, K.; Rodier, L.; Coxam, J. -Y. J.

40|$|AfficheAqueous {{solutions}} of amines {{are commonly}} used in post-combustion carbon dioxide capture processes. The dissolution of the gas in aqueous solutions depends on the molecular interactions in {water+amine+CO 2 } systems. Molecular simulation is a promising tool for predicting thermodynamic properties and establishing structure-propertie relationships essential {{to the development of}} predictive models. The main objective of this work is to develop a molecular force field adapted to describe interactions and conformations of <b>alcanolamines</b> containing the N-C-C-O backbone. Monoethanolamine (MEA) is the simplest amine containing this structure. It is also the reference absorbent for CO 2 capture processes [1]. We propose a methodology to determine the parameters needed for the molecular simulation of such amines. This methodology will be first tested for pure amines and then applied to aqueous solutions. In both situations, the amines are considered in a polar solvation environment, dominated by hydrogen bonding interactions. Thus, polarization effects were taken into account by calculating the electrostatic charge distributions in presence of solvent molecules. The densities and vaporization enthalpies of pure amines were calculated by molecular simulation and compared to experimental values...|$|R
