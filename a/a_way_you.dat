500|$|Singer {{described}} {{the film as}} Double Indemnity meets Rashomon, and {{said that it was}} made [...] "so you can go back and see all sorts of things you didn't realize were there the first time. You can get it a second time in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> never could have the first time around." [...] He also compared the film's structure to Citizen Kane (which also contained an interrogator and a subject who is telling a story) and the criminal caper The Anderson Tapes.|$|E
500|$|David had {{intended}} to publish a second such volume, and eight years after the author's death, Norman, her literary executor, published a sequel, Is There a Nutmeg in the House? (2000). Like its predecessor, it was drawn from magazine articles, essays and other earlier writings, to which Norman added articles written by David in the 1980s. The first section {{of the book is}} a short autobiographical piece, a rarity from David, who guarded her privacy carefully. David's interest in the historical aspects of cuisine is given scope in essays on the history of Oxo and Bovril, Alexis Soyer and the potato. Articles aimed at the domestic cook include [...] "Do not Despair over Rice", [...] "Making Ice Cream", and one propounding a view for which she was famous: [...] "Garlic Presses are Utterly Useless". The New York Times called the book [...] "this very appealing, completely absorbing miscellany.... This is a book good enough to eat—and, in <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> can." ...|$|E
500|$|Dixon {{said of his}} victory: [...] "It's not <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> want to win for sure. When I win, I want to win being faster {{or putting}} a good pass on someone. But the way our season is going, I'll be taking {{anything}} at the moment." [...] Second-place finisher Power said {{it was still a}} good finish for him in terms of scoring points. Tony Cotman, the circuit's design consultant, announced in February 2011 that the track would be improved and lengthened for that year. He stated that the layout of the track be moved to.the Eastern runway of the City Centre Airport in an attempt to create more excitement.

With his second-place finish, Power extended his points lead in the standings to 50 over Franchitti and 71 ahead of Dixon. Briscoe and Hunter-Reay retained fourth and fifth positions.|$|E

500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, {{there are a lot of}} people who have come up to me over the years and said, 'I met my wife playing Pong,' and that's kind of a nice thing to have achieved." ...|$|E
500|$|Scottish actor Kevin McKidd, who {{had never}} {{appeared}} in a television series that necessitated over twelve months of filming, was cast as Lucius Vorenus, one of the lead characters. McKidd said, [...] "What was different about this show is you get 14 months to really get into {{every nook and cranny}} of the character, in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> don't get a chance to explore when you do a movie or a theater play. Initially, it was a terrifying prospect. But once you got over that, you realize what a great opportunity it was." [...] Heller described his character as [...] "very much a Roman of the Old School, a stoic man devoted to duty and religion and the legion." [...] Ray Stevenson played Titus Pullo, a soldier who befriends Vorenus. McKidd said that [...] "they're kind of thrown together by fate, by chance, but somewhere along the line they start to stick... keep finding themselves accidentally at the epicenter of tumultuous events and immense change, so they're kind of clinging to each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of the band's music and lyrics were written by Patton, Dunn, and Spruance, with McKinnon and Heifetz occasionally contributing. Regarding their creative process, Bär McKinnon stated in a 2000 interview that [...] "This band {{is kind of like}} a cruel boys club in <b>a</b> <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> bring some ideas and if you're not 100 percent firm about bringing a certain idea to this group, you can watch it get kicked aside and die really quickly." ...|$|E
