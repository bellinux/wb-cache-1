[...] For instance, the positive part of an image is <b>a</b> <b>water-repelling</b> ("hydrophobic") substance, while the negative image would be water-retaining ("hydrophilic"). [...] Thus, when the plate is introduced to a compatible printing ink and water mixture, the ink will adhere to the positive image after it is etched {{with a mixture of}} gum arabic and acid then subsequently replaced with asphaltum stabilizing the drawing. This allows a flat print plate or stone to be used, enabling much longer and more detailed print runs than the older physical methods of printing (e.g., intaglio printing, letterpress printing).|$|E

5000|$|Like {{other species}} in the Polytrichaceae, Polytrichum strictum has leaves with a single costa, {{vertical}} lamellae, <b>a</b> <b>water-repelling</b> cuticle, and rhizoids that appear to facilitate external water movement in addition to anchoring the plant. [...] Dense tufts of slender stems from 6-12 cm form 20-40 cm hummocks in bogs and similar substrates. [...] Leaves are narrowly lanceolate, appressed to the stem when dry and spreading to erect when moist. The reddish awn (formed by the slightly excurrent costa) and smooth, inrolled leaf margins separate P. strictum from other Polytrichum species; only juniper haircap moss (P. juniperinum) shares these attributes. P. strictum, however, can be easily distinguished by the wooly-tomentose white rhizoids that extend up its stems (absent in P. juniperinum), {{as well as its}} boggy habitat and predilection for organic soils (in contrast to the weedy nature and preference for mineral soils that characterize P. juniperinum).|$|E
5000|$|A gutta (Latin pl. guttae, [...] "drops") is <b>a</b> small <b>water-repelling,</b> {{cone-shaped}} projection {{used in the}} architrave of the Doric {{order in}} classical architecture. At {{the top of the}} architrave blocks, a row of six guttae below the narrow projection of the taenia (fillet) and cymatium formed an element called a regula. A regula was aligned under each triglyph of the Doric frieze. In addition, the underside of the projecting geison above the frieze had rectangular protrusions termed mutules that each had three rows of six guttae. These mutules were aligned above each triglyph and each metope.|$|R
50|$|For {{the paper}} strips method, {{the paper is}} cut or torn into strips, and soaked in the paste until {{saturated}}. The saturated pieces are then placed onto the surface and allowed to dry slowly. The strips may be placed on an armature, or skeleton, often of wire mesh over a structural frame, or they can be placed on an object to create a cast. Oil or grease {{can be used as}} a release agent if needed. Once dried, the resulting material can be cut, sanded and/or painted, and waterproofed by painting with <b>a</b> suitable <b>water-repelling</b> paint. Before painting any product of papier-mâché, the glue must be fully dried, otherwise mold will form and the product will rot from the inside out.|$|R
5000|$|For the Deepwater Horizon {{oil spill}} {{that began in}} April 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico, HeiQ, TWE Group and Beyond Surface Technologies jointly {{developed}} <b>an</b> oil-absorbing, <b>water-repelling,</b> nonwoven fabric, in the name Oilguard [...] for oil relief efforts. The product was intended for beach protection against oil spills and {{was applied to the}} shoreline. This allows for the fabric to absorb crude oil while repelling the seawater. This innovation was rewarded the Swiss Technology Award (2010) and the Swiss Award (2013). The water-repelling property of Oilguard is achieved with a textile finishing that creates the Lotus Effect {{on the surface of the}} non-woven fabric. The non-fluorinated finishing makes the fabric only water repellent but not oil repellent, therefore the fabric absorbs oil crudes but not the seawater.|$|R
50|$|These {{plate and}} film {{products}} differed substantially {{only in the}} means used to manufacture the colour mosaic layer and its resulting pattern and fineness. Autochrome's mosaic was a random array of dyed potato starch grains, {{too small to be}} individually visible without a microscope. Most competing products employed a coarser geometric pattern created by one of the many methods devised and patented during that era. Dufaycolor's filter layer was of the geometric type, but its proprietary manufacturing process produced an unusually fine-patterned mosaic. A very thin coating of collodion {{on one side of the}} film base was dyed blue, printed with closely spaced fine lines using <b>a</b> <b>water-repelling</b> greasy ink, and bleached. The clear spaces created were then dyed green. The ink was removed and new ink lines were printed at a 90 degree angle to the blue and green lines. The new gaps were bleached and dyed red, resulting in a colour filter mosaic, known as a réseau, consisting of alternating green and blue squares between red lines, and having roughly one million colour filter elements per square inch.In very early years, different arrangements of the same colours were used, the lines being green or blue instead of red and sometimes intersecting the other colours diagonally. After a final ink removal and the application of an isolating varnish, the same side of the film base was coated with a panchromatic black-and-white photographic emulsion. When exposed to light through the base and its réseau, the bit of emulsion behind each colour element recorded only the amount of light of that primary colour striking the film at that point.|$|E
50|$|Because {{they feel}} similar {{when applied to}} human skin, {{there is a common}} {{misconception}} that petroleum jelly and glycerol (glycerine) are physically similar. Petroleum jelly is <b>a</b> non-polar hydrophobic (<b>water-repelling)</b> hydrocarbon and insoluble in water. Glycerol is an alcohol that is strongly hydrophilic (water-attracting): by continuously absorbing moisture from the air (humectant), it produces the feeling of wetness on the skin. This feeling of wetness is similar to the feeling of greasiness produced by petroleum jelly.|$|R
40|$|Beside {{the athletes}} themselves, {{a number of}} factors {{influence}} performance in crosscountry skiing. Ski technicians typically have five possible adjustments to make to the given snow, track and weather conditions. These are: (1) to choose skis with certain desired mechanical properties, (2) to apply a suitable grind to the ski base, (3) to change the material of the running surface, (4) to apply a combination of various waxes and (5) to decide the fine-tuning of the surface texture with a hand tool. Extensive testing is their major approach prior to important competitions. This thesis presents experimental studies on such methods in the field and laboratory, and is divided into four studies: I  Investigation of mechanical ski properties of classical and skate skis in laboratory tests. More than 800 racing skis from the Norwegian cross-country, biathlon and Nordic combined teams have been analysed in the laboratory in the period 2009 to 2011. The study showed that men and women chose skis with similar stiffness characteristics for classic ski in the cold category whereas women selected ski which required 5 % higher load to compress the camber down to 0. 2 mm. Several significant differences in ski characteristics were found for skating skis of male athletes between the three Nordic national teams of cross-country, biathlon and Nordic combined. The ski characteristics of the teams were mostly determined by the ski brand’s specific ski characteristics. This finding was also in line with the documented changes due to temperature change. Temperature changes can result in increased or decreased stiffness, but in comparison with differences in characteristics between ski brands, the magnitude of these changes is on a much smaller scale II  The resetting process of the base material after a treatment with manual rilling tools were investigated. All tested skis were tested in the laboratory and in the field. The major goal of this study was {{the development of a new}} grinding machine for crosscountry skis from scratch. A comparison between traditional stone grinding and the newly developed grinding method is presented. Initial studies showed that the newly developed method resulted in a lower coefficient of variance of the average mean roughness of the produced structure. A reproducibility within smaller tolerances is in strong demand by ski technicians. III  A new inertial measurement unit (IMU) -based sensor was developed and tested in a ski tunnel. During the gliding tests, several systems were tested and compared to each other. By using a low-cost IMU and correction methods it was possible to produce reasonable estimates and distinguish between good and bad skis with a difference in the kinetic coefficient of friction of around 0. 01. The accuracy needs to be improved by a factor of ten in order to meet the precision requirement and provide a system which can distinguish between skis with similar glide performance. IV  The characteristics of two coatings and their contribution to a reduced coefficient of friction were studied. In addition, the structural changes of the ski base material due to the waxing process and subsequent skiing were studied. The Fluorine content, both in the base material and in the wax was given special attention. Field and laboratory experiments on the ski base materials, with and without waxes, were conducted. The study showed that products containing fluorine contributed to a lower surface energy and hence <b>a</b> more <b>water-repelling</b> surface with <b>a</b> higher static water contact angle. Carrying out direct comparisons between the outdoor field tests and the lab tests in this study proved challenging, since the product with highest measured coefficient of friction from the laboratory tests and lowest contact angle performed best in the final gliding test after 34. 1 km of skiing. Aside from this, there were many similarities. These four studies resulted in seven publications, P 1 - 7, which are attached in the appendices to this thesis. The work in this thesis resulted in the development of a new grinding machine for crosscountry skis, which opens up for further development in the field of surface treatments. In addition a new device to measure ski characteristics has been developed, which was used in the second half of Study I to measure ski characteristics.
