40|$|AbstractAn {{explicit}} functional {{called the}} shiftability value of wavelet basis, which measures a deviation from translation-invariance, is studied. For functions φ with ‖φ‖ = 1, {{it lies in}} (0, 1] with the value 1 being best possible. The relation between the shiftability value rV of the father wavelet and the corresponding value rW of the mother wavelet is given. The shiftability value of Meyer's wavelet and the B-spline wavelets is computed. For Meyer's wavelet, we prove that rW = 3 rV − 2 and demonstrate how to control the shiftability value by properly designing the wavelet. For the B-spline wavelet of order n, we give the <b>asymptotical</b> <b>relation</b> r(n) W ∼ 3 r(n) V − 2, and show r(n) V → 1 as n → ∞. The family of B-spline wavelets contains several well-known wavelets such as Franklin's wavelet, Battle's wavelet, and Lemarié's wavelet, which makes our results potentially useful...|$|E
40|$|Derived {{from the}} light {{scattering}} by a radially anisotropic sphere, unusual scattering behavior is exhibited, which breaks the Rayleigh law (scattering efficiency Qsca ∼ q 4 as q → 0, where q is the size parameter). Under certain con-ditions, we demonstrate an <b>asymptotical</b> <b>relation</b> between Qsca and q, i. e., Qsca Fq 8, which is not realizable for isotropic particles in Rayleigh regime. Moreover, suitable adjustment of the anisotropic parameters can further suppress the coefficient F, resulting in enhanced transparency of the anisotropic particle. © 2012 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 290. 4020, 290. 5870, 290. 5850, 160. 1190. Light scattering by a small obstacle {{is one of the}} most fundamental problems in classical electrodynamics [1 – 8]. The pioneering researcher is Rayleigh [1], who stu-died the elastic scattering of light by spherical particles in the small particle limit. For a homogeneous sphere with arbitrary size, the full-wave electromagnetic theory was established by Mie [2]. For instance, the scattering cross section can be written in terms of the Mie scattering coef...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{two types}} of trackers, namely {{correlation}} filter based tracker (CF tracker) and structured output tracker (Struck), have exhibited the state-of-the-art performance. However, {{there seems to be}} lack of analytic work on their relations in the computer vision community. In this paper, we investigate two state-of-the-art CF trackers, i. e., spatial regularization discriminative correlation filter (SRDCF) and correlation filter with limited boundaries (CFLB), and Struck, and reveal their relations. Specifically, after extending the CFLB to its multiple channel version we prove the relation between SRDCF and CFLB on the condition that the spatial regularization factor of SRDCF is replaced by the masking matrix of CFLB. We also prove the <b>asymptotical</b> approximate <b>relation</b> between SRDCF and Struck on the conditions that the spatial regularization factor of SRDCF is replaced by an indicator function of object bounding box, the weights of SRDCF in its loss item are replaced by those of Struck, the linear kernel is employed by Struck, and the search region tends to infinity. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks OTB 50 and OTB 100 are conducted to verify our theoretical results. Moreover, we explain how detailed differences among SRDCF, CFLB, and Struck would give rise to slightly different performances on visual sequence...|$|R
