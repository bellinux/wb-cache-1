5|$|If truly a gondwanathere, TNM02067 {{extends the}} known {{geographic}} {{range of the}} group to <b>another</b> <b>part</b> of Gondwana, the African mainland. The uncertain age of locality TZ-07 renders a precise assessment {{of the significance of}} TNM02067 difficult. It may well be older than the oldest previously known gondwanathere, the Campanian Gondwanatherium. It also has implications for the hypothesis that Africa was isolated from the rest of Gondwana from an early dateas early as the early Cretaceousand consequently had a fauna distinct from the rest of Gondwana for much of the Cretaceous, as it may be closely related to the sudamericids of South America, India, Madagascar, and Antarctica, a highly derived group.|$|E
