5|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{states that}} zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose, causing <b>anosmia.</b> Reports of <b>anosmia</b> were also {{observed}} in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections. On June 16, 2009, the FDA ordered removal of zinc-based intranasal cold products from store shelves. The FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke, and cannot tell if food has spoiled before they eat it.|$|E
25|$|Reduction or loss {{of sense}} of smell (hyposmia or <b>anosmia)</b> may be an early marker of the disease.|$|E
25|$|A {{clinical}} study reported in 2008 that theophylline was helpful {{in improving the}} sense of smell in study subjects with <b>anosmia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although all {{individuals}} with ORS {{believe they have}} an odor, {{in some cases the}} individual reports they cannot perceive the odor themselves. In the latter cases, the belief arises via misinterpretation of the behavior of others or with the rationale that a disorder of smell which prevents self detection of the odor (i.e. <b>anosmia)</b> exists. In the cases where the non-existent odor can be detected, this is usually considered as phantosmia (olfactory hallucination). Olfactory hallucination can be considered the result of the belief in an odor delusion, or the belief a result of the olfactory hallucination. In one review, the individual with ORS was unreservedly convinced that he or she could detect the odor themselves in 22% of cases, whilst in 19% there was occasional or intermittent detection and in 59% lack of self-detection was present.|$|E
500|$|Damage to the {{olfactory}} nerve (I) can cause {{an inability to}} smell (<b>anosmia),</b> a distortion {{in the sense of}} smell (parosmia), or a distortion or lack of taste. If there is suspicion of a change in the sense of smell, each nostril is tested with substances of known odors such as coffee or soap. [...] Intensely smelling substances, for example ammonia, may lead to the activation of pain receptors (nociceptors) of the trigeminal nerve that are located in the nasal cavity and this can confound olfactory testing.|$|E
2500|$|Katich {{attended}} Trinity College in Perth, Western Australia, {{where there}} is a cricket pavilion named after him. He married Georgie Willis in May 2006. He holds a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Western Australia. He has <b>anosmia,</b> which was caused by an attack of glandular fever.|$|E
2500|$|One {{possible}} {{cause of a}} delay in the onset of puberty past the age 14 in girls and 15 in boys is Kallmann syndrome, a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). Kallmann syndrome is also associated {{with a lack of}} sense of smell (<b>anosmia).</b> [...] Kallmann syndrome and other forms of HH affect both men and women. It is caused by a failure in HPG axis at puberty which results in low or zero gonadotropin (LH and FSH) levels with the subsequent result of a failure to commence or complete puberty, secondary hypogonadism and infertility.|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} homeopathic {{dilution}} results in no objectively detectable active ingredient in most cases, but some preparations (e.g. calendula and arnica creams) do contain pharmacologically active doses. One product, Zicam Cold Remedy, which was marketed as an [...] "unapproved homeopathic" [...] product, contains two ingredients {{that are only}} [...] "slightly" [...] diluted: zinc acetate (2X = 1/100 dilution) and zinc gluconate (1X = 1/10 dilution), which means both are present in a biologically active concentration strong enough to have caused some people to lose their sense of smell, a condition termed <b>anosmia.</b> Zicam also listed several normal homeopathic potencies as [...] "inactive ingredients", including galphimia glauca, histamine dihydrochloride (homeopathic name, histaminum hydrochloricum), luffa operculata, and sulfur.|$|E
2500|$|Smell or {{olfaction}} (adjectival form: olfactory) is {{the other}} [...] "chemical" [...] sense. Unlike taste, {{there are hundreds of}} olfactory receptors (388 according to one source), each binding to a particular molecular feature. Odor molecules possess a variety of features and, thus, excite specific receptors more or less strongly. This combination of excitatory signals from different receptors makes up what we perceive as the molecule's smell. In the brain, olfaction is processed by the olfactory system. Olfactory receptor neurons in the nose differ from most other neurons in that they die and regenerate on a regular basis. The inability to smell is called <b>anosmia.</b> Some neurons in the nose are specialized to detect pheromones.|$|E
2500|$|By {{definition}} {{chronic sinusitis}} lasts longer {{than three months}} and {{can be caused by}} many different diseases that share chronic inflammation of the sinuses as a common symptom. Symptoms of chronic sinusitis may include any combination of the following: nasal congestion, facial pain, headache, night-time coughing, an increase in previously minor or controlled asthma symptoms, general malaise, thick green or yellow discharge, feeling of facial 'fullness' or 'tightness' that may worsen when bending over, dizziness, aching teeth, and/or bad breath. Each of these symptoms has multiple other possible causes, which should be considered and investigated as well. [...] Often chronic sinusitis can lead to <b>anosmia,</b> the inability to smell objects. In a small number of cases, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis is associated with a dental infection. Vertigo, lightheadedness, and blurred vision are not typical in chronic sinusitis and other causes should be investigated.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anosmia</b> (...) is the {{inability}} to perceive odor {{or a lack of}} functioning olfaction—the loss of the sense of smell. <b>Anosmia</b> may be temporary, but some <b>anosmia</b> (including traumatic <b>anosmia)</b> can be permanent. <b>Anosmia</b> is due to a number of factors, including an inflammation of the nasal mucosa, blockage of nasal passages or a destruction of one temporal lobe. Inflammation is due to chronic mucosa changes in the paranasal sinus lining and the middle and superior turbinates.|$|E
50|$|A {{study done}} on {{patients}} suffering from <b>anosmia</b> {{found that when}} testing both nostrils, there was no <b>anosmia</b> revealed; however, when testing each nostril individually, tests showed that the sense of smell was usually affected in {{only one of the}} nostrils as opposed to both. This demonstrated that unilateral <b>anosmia</b> is not uncommon in <b>anosmia</b> patients.|$|E
5000|$|Loss {{of smell}} {{is known as}} <b>anosmia.</b> <b>Anosmia</b> can occur on both sides or a single side.|$|E
50|$|Olfactory {{problems}} {{can be divided into}} different types based on their malfunction. The olfactory dysfunction can be total (<b>anosmia),</b> incomplete (partial <b>anosmia,</b> hyposmia, or microsmia), distorted (dysosmia), or can be characterized by spontaneous sensations like phantosmia. An inability to recognize odors despite a normally functioning olfactory system is termed olfactory agnosia. Hyperosmia is a rare condition typified by an abnormally heightened sense of smell. Like vision and hearing, the olfactory {{problems can}} be bilateral or unilateral meaning if a person has <b>anosmia</b> {{on the right side of}} the nose but not the left, it is a unilateral right <b>anosmia.</b> On the other hand, if it is on both sides of the nose it is called bilateral <b>anosmia</b> or total <b>anosmia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Olfactory {{dysfunction}} can be quantitative and/or qualitative. Quantitative smell disorders {{refer to}} disorders {{in which there}} is complete or partial loss of olfaction. <b>Anosmia,</b> the complete loss of olfaction, and hyposmia, the partial loss of olfaction are the two disorders classified as quantitative because they can be measured. Qualitative smell disorders can’t be measured and refer to disorders {{in which there is}} alternation or distortion in the perception of smell. Qualitative disorders include parosmia (also called troposmia) and phantosmia. The term dysosmia refers to a qualitative olfaction disorder and include both parosmia and phantosmia. Olfactory dysfunction including <b>anosmia,</b> hyposmia, and dysosmia can be either bilateral or unilateral on either nostril. <b>Anosmia</b> only on the left nostril would be termed unilateral left <b>anosmia</b> while bilateral <b>anosmia</b> would be termed total <b>anosmia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Anosmia</b> is the {{inability}} to perceive odor, or in other words a lack of functioning olfaction. Many patients may experience unilateral or bilateral <b>anosmia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Anosmia</b> Awareness Day {{is a day}} {{to spread}} {{awareness}} about <b>Anosmia</b> (an-OHZ-me-uh), {{the loss of the}} sense of smell, and it takes place each year on February 27.|$|E
50|$|A {{standard}} smell {{test can}} be used to check for <b>anosmia,</b> but it must be remembered that even in total <b>anosmia</b> various substances (such as menthol and alcohol) can still be detected by direct stimulation of the trigeminal nerve.|$|E
50|$|Amiodarone {{is a drug}} used in the {{treatment}} of arrhythmias of the heart. A clinical study performed demonstrated that the use of this drug induced <b>anosmia</b> in some patients. Although rare, there was a case in which a 66-year-old male was treated with Amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia. After the use of the drug he began experiencing olfactory disturbance, however after decreasing the dosage of Amiodarone, the severity of the <b>anosmia</b> decreased accordingly hence correlating the use of Amiodarone to the development of <b>anosmia.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{temporary}} loss {{of smell}} {{can be caused}} by a blocked nose or infection. In contrast, a permanent loss of smell may be caused by death of olfactory receptor neurons in the nose or by brain injury in which there is damage to the olfactory nerve or damage to brain areas that process smell (see olfactory system). The lack of the sense of smell at birth, usually due to genetic factors, is referred to as congenital <b>anosmia.</b> Family members of the patient suffering from congenital <b>anosmia</b> are often found with similar histories; this suggests that the <b>anosmia</b> may follow an autosomal dominant pattern. <b>Anosmia</b> may very occasionally be an early sign of a degenerative brain disease such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anosmia</b> {{can have}} a number of harmful effects. Patients with sudden onset <b>anosmia</b> may find food less appetizing, though {{congenital}} anosmics rarely complain about this, and none report a loss in weight. Loss of smell can also be dangerous because it hinders the detection of gas leaks, fire, and spoiled food. The common view of <b>anosmia</b> as trivial can {{make it more difficult for}} a patient to receive the same types of medical aid as someone who has lost other senses, such as hearing or sight.|$|E
50|$|Total lack {{of sense}} of smell (<b>anosmia)</b> or {{markedly}} reduced sense of smell (hyposmia). This is the defining feature of Kallmann syndrome; it is not seen in other cases of HH. Approximately 50% of HH cases occur with <b>anosmia</b> and can be termed as Kallmann syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Destruction to {{brodmann area}} 34 results in {{ipsilateral}} <b>anosmia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Destruction to the {{olfactory}} tract {{results in}} ipsilateral <b>anosmia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Each KS/CHH {{case can}} show a {{different}} range of symptoms {{and a different}} severity of symptoms. Severity can range from total absence of puberty with <b>anosmia</b> to slightly delayed puberty with or without <b>anosmia.</b> Even family members will not always show {{the same degree of}} symptoms. In the same family with the same KS gene defect, some members may have complete KS with no sense of smell, others may have CHH with some sense of smell, and still others may have isolated <b>anosmia</b> and no hormone deficiencies. Cases of KS/CHH can be separated into different categories depending on the gene mutation(s) involved.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anosmia</b> (due to {{branches}} of the olfactory bulb and olfactory tract) ...|$|E
50|$|Hyposmia is {{a reduced}} ability to smell and to detect odors. A related {{condition}} is <b>anosmia,</b> {{in which no}} odors can be detected. Some {{of the causes of}} olfaction problems are allergies, nasal polyps, viral infections and head trauma. It is estimated that up to 4 million people in the United States have hyposmia or the related <b>anosmia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Though <b>anosmia</b> {{caused by}} brain damage cannot be treated, <b>anosmia</b> caused by {{inflammatory}} {{changes in the}} mucosa may be treated with glucocorticoids. Reduction of inflammation {{through the use of}} oral glucocorticoids such as prednisone, followed by long term topical glucocorticoid nasal spray, would easily and safely treat the <b>anosmia.</b> A prednisone regimen is adjusted based on the degree of the thickness of mucosa, the discharge of oedema and {{the presence or absence of}} nasal polyps. However, the treatment is not permanent and may have to be repeated after a short while. Together with medication, pressure of the upper area of the nose must be mitigated through aeration and drainage.|$|E
50|$|There {{have also}} been cases where the use of {{acupuncture}} have successfully treated <b>anosmia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Reduced {{sense of}} smell (hyposmia) or no {{sense of smell}} (<b>anosmia)</b> {{suggests}} Kallmann syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anosmia</b> can be {{diagnosed}} by doctors by using acetylcysteine tests. Doctors {{will begin with}} a detailed elicitation of history. Then the doctor will ask for any related injuries in relation to <b>anosmia</b> which could include upper respiratory infections or head injury. Psychophysical Assessment of order and taste identification {{can be used to}} identify <b>anosmia.</b> A nervous system examination is performed to see if the cranial nerves are damaged. The diagnosis as well as the degree of impairment can now be tested much more efficiently and effectively than ever before thanks to [...] "smell testing kits" [...] that have been made available as well as screening tests which use materials that most clinics would readily have. Occasionally, after accidents, there is a change in a patient's sense of smell. Particular smells that were present before are no longer present. On occasion, after head traumas, there are patients who have unilateral <b>anosmia.</b> The sense of smell should be tested individually in each nostril.|$|E
50|$|For a time, scratch-and-sniff {{stickers}} {{were used}} to diagnose <b>anosmia,</b> although this practice later declined.|$|E
5000|$|Nose: Loss of, {{or reduced}} sense of, smell (<b>anosmia).</b> Some {{patients}} claim extra-sensitive sense of smell.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anosmia</b> {{caused by}} a nasal polyp may be treated by steroidal {{treatment}} or removal of the polyp.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} with <b>anosmia,</b> leaving him with no sense of smell and {{virtually}} no sense of taste.|$|E
50|$|The {{changes in}} {{olfactory}} function {{can be placed}} into three categories: (1) <b>anosmia,</b> the inability to smell; (2) hyposmia, a reduced ability to smell; or (3) dysosmia, where olfactory signals are incorrectly processed. Most chemicals at lower concentrations cause a degree of hyposmia while at higher concentrations <b>anosmia</b> is the result. Dysomia is less commonly observed, however, cases of fish becoming attracted to metal-contaminated waters have been studied and examined.|$|E
