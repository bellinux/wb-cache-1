In the 1950s the nearby villages of Combe Down, Twerton and Weston were incorporated into the city to enable the development of housing, much of it council housing. In the 1970s and 1980s it was recognised that conservation of historic buildings was inadequate, leading to more care and reuse of buildings and open spaces. In 1987 the city was selected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, recognising its international cultural significance.|$|E

5|$|Groundwater {{levels have}} been dropping, to varying degrees, in many <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> {{due in part}} to an {{increase}} in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground.

5|$|Maya {{cities were}} not {{formally}} planned, and {{were subject to}} irregular expansion, with the haphazard addition of palaces, temples and other buildings. Most Maya cities tended to grow outwards from the core, and upwards as new structures were superimposed upon preceding architecture. Maya cities usually had a ceremonial and administrative centre surrounded by a vast irregular sprawl of residential complexes. The centres of all Maya cities featured sacred precincts, sometimes separated from nearby residential areas by walls. These precincts contained pyramid temples and other monumental architecture dedicated to elite activities, such as basal platforms that supported administrative or elite residential complexes. Sculpted monuments were raised to record the deeds of the ruling dynasty. City centres also featured plazas, sacred ballcourts and buildings used for marketplaces and schools. Frequently causeways linked the centre to outlying <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Some of these classes of architecture formed lesser groups in the outlying <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> which served as sacred centres for non-royal lineages. The areas adjacent to these sacred compounds included residential complexes housing wealthy lineages. The largest and richest of these elite compounds sometimes possessed sculpture and art of craftsmanship {{equal to that of}} royal art.|$|E

5|$|Skopje is an {{ethnically diverse}} city, and its urban {{sociology}} primarily depends on {{ethnic and religious}} belonging.
