5|$|Helmut Lent's {{state funeral}} {{was held in}} the Reich Chancellery, Berlin, on Wednesday 11 October 1944. Reich Marshal Hermann Göring took the salute at Lent's coffin, which was draped in the {{national}} flag. Ahead of the coffin, carrying Lent's honours and decorations on <b>a</b> <b>velvet</b> cushion, marched Werner Streib, the Inspector of Night Fighters. On 12 October 1944 Lent and his crew were interred in a single grave in the military cemetery at Stade.|$|E
5|$|Unpalatability, broadly understood, can {{be created}} {{in a variety of}} ways. Some insects such as the {{ladybird}} or tiger moth contain bitter-tasting chemicals, while the skunk produces a noxious odour, and the poison glands of the poison dart frog, the sting of <b>a</b> <b>velvet</b> ant or neurotoxin in a black widow spider make them dangerous or painful to attack. Tiger moths advertise their unpalatability by either producing ultrasonic noises which warn bats to avoid them, or by warning postures which expose brightly coloured body parts (see Unkenreflex), or exposing eyespots. Velvet ants (actually parasitic wasps) such as Dasymutilla occidentalis both have bright colours and produce audible noises when grabbed (via stridulation), which serve to reinforce the warning. Among mammals, predators can be dissuaded when a smaller animal is aggressive and able to defend itself, as for example in honey badgers.|$|E
5|$|The Phantom brings Christine {{back down}} to his lair. Madame Giry shows Raoul where the Phantom lives, and he goes to rescue Christine. The Phantom forces Christine to don the wedding dress and once again professes his love, and orders Christine to marry him. Christine tries to {{convince}} the Phantom {{that she does not}} fear his ugliness, but rather his anger and willingness to kill to get what he wants. Just then, Raoul enters the lair, and the Phantom ties him to a gate and threatens to kill him if Christine refuses to marry him. Christine reflects over the impossible choice before passionately kissing the Phantom to show him he is not alone in the world. The Phantom is shocked from experiencing real human love {{for the first time in}} his life. Ashamed of his murderous actions, he allows Christine and Raoul to leave and orders them to never return. He finds comfort in a little monkey music box. Christine approaches the Phantom, who tells her that he loves her, and she silently gives him the diamond ring from her finger to remember her by. After Christine and Raoul leave, the Phantom smashes every mirror in his underground lair and disappears through a secret passage behind <b>a</b> <b>velvet</b> curtain just before the police arrive. Upon entering, Meg finds only the Phantom's white mask.|$|E

There was an account claiming that Taksin was secretly sent to a palace located in the remote mountains of Nakhon Si Thammarat where he lived until 1825, and that a substitute was beaten to death in his place. King Taksin's ashes and those of his wife are located at Wat Intharam (located in Thonburi). They have been placed in two lotus bud shaped stupas which stand before the old hall.|$|E

25|$|The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom and the American Kennel Club in the United States {{recognize}} {{only two}} varieties of Chihuahua: the long coat, and the smooth coat, {{also referred to}} as longhaired and shorthaired. They are genetically the same breed. The term smooth coat {{does not mean that the}} hair is necessarily smooth, as the hair can range from having <b>a</b> <b>velvet</b> touch to a whiskery feeling. Longhaired Chihuahuas are actually smoother to the touch, having soft, fine guard hairs and a downy undercoat, which gives them their fluffy appearance. Unlike many longhaired breeds, longhaired Chihuahuas require no trimming and minimal grooming. Contrary to popular belief, the longhaired breed also typically sheds less than its shorthaired counterparts. It may take up to three or more years before a full longhaired coat develops.|$|E

25|$|Officers of the {{universities}} generally wear distinctive and more elaborate dress. The Chancellor and the Vice-Chancellor may wear a black damask lay type gown (sometimes with a long train) trimmed with gold or silver lace and frogs. They wear <b>a</b> <b>velvet</b> mortarboard, similarly trimmed with gold braid and tassel. This form of dress is not strictly 'academical' but it is typical dress for those in high positions. Other than this gown, they may have other distinct forms of dress, such as the scarlet cappa clausa or cope worn in certain circumstances by the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge or his/her deputy and by higher doctors presenting candidates for degrees, which was once worn by Doctors of Divinity. In the past, Chancellors may also wear full court dress with breeches and court shoes {{like that of the}} Lord Chancellor of Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|When French {{troops had}} {{approached}} the rivers Rhine and Meuse in November 1794, the Patriots started {{to prepare for}} a revolution and to stockpile weapons. The hiding place was discovered, and Jacobus van Staphorst and Cornelis Rudolphus Theodorus Krayenhoff had to leave the city to avoid being captured. The society in the Kalverstraat was closed down by the police and Wiselius, the president, had to announce the message to its members. In January 1795 Wiselius and Nicolaas van Staphorst were part of the revolutionary committee that occupied the townhall. Wiselius stood before the city government in the nearby townhall on the Dam Square to state that the time had arrived for them to resign. The next morning, the new leaders moved in without much ado and voted Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck as their president. Stadholder William V escaped by boat from the beach near the Hague to England; there were no casualties and it is known as <b>a</b> <b>velvet</b> revolution.|$|E

[...] Reviewer Brad McKay found Ed [...] "both hopeless and funny, a trick moviemakers like Tim Burton and Todd Solondz wish they could pull off more regularly".|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics are}} from the {{viewpoint}} of Elektra King, the Bond girl revealed as the mastermind of the villainous scheme. Its underlying themes are seduction and domination, described by Arnold as [...] "a steel fist in <b>a</b> <b>velvet</b> glove. It beckons you in with its crooked finger." [...] Black added that although the lyrics reflected the film's plot, they were [...] "of course all about world domination" [...] and [...] "a lot more personal and intense", evoking a [...] "ballady and dramatic" [...] mood. A line of dialogue from the film, [...] "There's no point in living if you can't feel alive," [...] was included in the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Hunky Dory (1971) found Visconti, Bowie's {{producer}} and bassist, supplanted in both roles by Ken Scott and Trevor Bolder respectively. The album saw the partial {{return of the}} fey pop singer of [...] "Space Oddity", with light fare such as [...] "Kooks", a song written for his son, Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones, born on 30 May. (His parents chose [...] "his kooky name"—he was known as Zowie for the next 12 years—after the Greek word zoe, life.) Elsewhere, the album explored more serious subjects, and found Bowie paying unusually direct homage to his influences with [...] "Song for Bob Dylan", [...] "Andy Warhol", and [...] "Queen Bitch", <b>a</b> <b>Velvet</b> Underground pastiche. It {{was not a significant}} commercial success at the time.|$|E
