Nuclear information as specified in the act may inadvertently appear in unclassified documents and must be reclassified when discovered. Even documents created by private individuals have been seized for containing nuclear information and classified. Only the Department of Energy may declassify nuclear information.|$|R

The {{study was to}} collect Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Kaunas Clinics Public Eye Clinic 25 patients (women and men) data. A study carried out used fundus video shooting, optical coherence tomography and retinal sensitivity test. Total survey to collect data that represent multimodal information was to combine five layers of two-dimensional set. All data have been adapted to each other, following this principle, that a simple form of pixel data represent information on the same physical point in the retina. Results: Available data according to Fisher's statistics created three canonical function, which according to Wilk's Lambda criterion two canonical functions showed the highest statistical values. The first and second canonical function is recommended for the eye disease classification. Conclusions: Examination of the eye lens turbidity, effects, observed that the opacity of the lens {{has a tendency to}} change the eye colour gamut changes {{in the bottom of the}} image. The evaluation of multimodal information components weight, noticed that the bottom of the eye image of green and red colours and retinal sensitivity and thickness are important for eye diseases classification.

5000|$|Campos do Jordão {{features}} a subtropical highland climate under the Köppen climate <b>classification</b> <b>abbreviated</b> Cfb/Cwb. Despite its location within the tropics, {{due to the}} high elevation, temperatures here are cooler than one might expect. The resort town features “spring-like” temperatures throughout the year, with mild summers and cool winters. However, by Brazilian standards, the town is downright cold. In summer, maximum temperatures average 24°C/75°F and minimum temperatures average 13°C/55°F. In winter, maximum temperatures average 18°C/64°F and minimum temperatures average 4°C/39°F. Temperatures drop below zero sometimes in winter (lowest ever recorded: -7.3°C/19°F), but snow is very rare. Similar to many other places with this climate, Campos do Jordão sees a noticeable drying trend during its “low-sun” season. The city sees on average 1800 mm of precipitation, most of which falls from September through March.|$|R

5000|$|Classified {{information}} is material {{that a government}} body claims is sensitive information that requires protection of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Access is restricted by law or regulation to particular groups of people, and mishandling can incur criminal penalties and loss of respect. A formal security clearance is often required to handle classified documents or access classified data. The clearance process usually requires a satisfactory background investigation. Documents and other information assets are typically marked with one of several (hierarchical) levels of sensitivity—e.g. restricted, confidential, secret and top secret. The choice of level is often based on an impact assessment; governments often have their own set of rules which include the levels, rules on determining the level for an information asset, and rules on how to protect information classified at each level. This often includes security clearances for personnel handling the information. Although [...] "classified information" [...] refers to the formal categorization and marking of material by level of sensitivity, it has also developed a sense synonymous with [...] "censored" [...] in US English. A distinction is often made between formal security <b>classification</b> and privacy <b>markings</b> such as [...] "commercial in confidence". Classifications {{can be used with}} additional keywords that give more detailed instructions on how data should be used or protected.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA revised {{petrographic}} {{classification of}} progressive stages of shock metamorphism of ordinary chondrites is proposed. Six stages of shock (S 1 to S 6) are defined, based on shock effects in olivine and plagioclase as recognized by thin section microscopy. The characteristic shock effects of each shock stage are: S 1 (unshocked) —sharp optical extinction of olivine; S 2 (very weakly shocked) —undulatory extinction of olivine; S 3 (weakly shocked) —planar fractures in olivine; S 4 (moderately shocked) —mosaicism in olivine; S 5 (strongly shocked) —isotropization of plagioclase (maskelynite) and planar deformation features in olivine; and S 6 (very strongly shocked) —recrystallization of olivine, sometimes combined with phase transformations (ringwoodite and/or phases produced by dissociation reactions). S 6 effects are always restricted to regions adjacent to melted portions {{of a sample}} which is otherwise only strongly shocked. In stages S 3 to S 6, localized melting results from stress and temperature peaks which locally deviate from the equilibration shock pressure, {{due to differences in}} shock impedance. These melting effects are (a) opaque melt veins (shock veins); (b) melt pockets with interconnecting melt veins; (c) melt dikes; and (d) troilite/metal deposits in fractures. Based on a critical evaluation of data from shock recovery experiments, a shock pressure calibration for the six shock stages is proposed, which defines the S 1 /S 2, S 2 / S 3, S 3 /S 4, S 4 /S 5, and S 5 /S 6 transitions at < 5, 5 – 10, 15 – 20, 30 – 35, and 45 – 55 GPa, respectively. Whole-rock melting and formation of impact melt rocks or melt breccias occurs at about 75 – 90 GPa. The symbol for the shock stage may be used in combination with the symbol for the petrologic type to <b>abbreviate</b> the complete <b>classification</b> of a chondrite, e. g., H 5 (S 3). We propose this new shock classification and pressure calibration system to replace previous systems, which are out-of-date with respect to the pressure calibration, nominally restricted to L chondrites, and based on incomplete and, in part, illdefined sets of shock effects. We have classified seventy-six ordinary chondrites using the new classification system and conclude the following: 1. 1) Shock effects and the sequence of progressively increasing degrees of shock metamorphism are very similar in H, L, and LL groups. Differences in the frequency distribution of shock stages are relatively minor; e. g., L chondrites appear to have the largest fraction with stages S 5 and S 6. This suggests that the collisional histories of the H, L, and LL parent bodies were similar. 2. 2) Petrologic type 3 chondrites are deficient in stages S 4 to S 6 and, with increasing petrologic type, the frequency of stages S 4 to S 6 increases. We suggest that the more porous and volatile-rich type 3 chondrites are subject to melting at a lower shock pressure than the nonporous chondrites of higher petrologic type. Volatiles trapped in pores cause shock-induced dispersal of the shocked and melted material into small particles which are not expected to survive as meteorites. 3. 3) Stage S 3 is the most abundant in nearly all petrologic types. 4. 4) At shock pressures in excess of about 35 GPa (S 5 and S 6), 4 He and 40 Ar are almost completely lost; pressures below 10 GPa (S 1 and S 2) do not cause noble gas losses...|$|R
