With increasing number of wireless subscribers {{and the advent of}} more powerful smartphones, demand for bandwidth will significantly increase in the next decade. Therefore, current wireless systems will face a capacity problem and new architectures need to be considered for the future wireless internet. Among the many possibilities to increase capacity significantly, we identify two important concepts to be considered: Wireless Mesh/Relay based access networks and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). In wireless mesh networks (WMNs), nodes relay packets over the air interface towards the destination or internet gateways. In DSA based solutions, nodes share a frequency portion dynamically and adapt according to specific rules in order to achieve some performance objectives.

40|$|Abstract—An optimal videokeratoscopic image {{presents}} a strong well-oriented pattern over {{the majority of}} the measured corneal surface. In the presence of interference, arising from reflections from eyelashes or tear film instability, the pattern's flow is disturbed and the local orientation of the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interference</b> is no longer coherent with the global flow. Detecting and analysing videokeratoscopic pattern interference is important when assessing tear film surface quality, break-up time and location as well as designing tools that provide a more accurate static measurement of corneal topography. In this paper a set of algorithms for detecting interference patterns in videokeratoscopic images is presented. First a frequency approach is used to subtract the background information from the oriented structure and then a gradient-based analysis is used to obtain the pattern's orientation and coherence. The proposed techniques are compared to a previously reported method based on statistical block normalisation and Gabor filtering. The results indicate that the proposed technique leads, in most cases: to a better videokeratoscopic interference detection system, that for a given probability of the useful signal detection (99. 7...|$|E

A portion of the torsional moment of the baffle corresponding to the region of the force interaction of the impeller discharge stream and the baffle is calculated under the assumption of constant angular momentum in the flow region between the impeller and the baffles. This theoretically obtained quantity is compared with the torsional moment of the baffles calculated from the experimentally determined distribution of the peripheral (tangential) component of dynamic pressure along the height of the radial baffle in pilot plant mixing equipment. It follows from the results of our calculations that for both investigated impeller off-bottom clearances the theoretically determined transferred torsional moment of the baffles in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interference</b> between the impeller discharge flow and the baffles agrees fairly well with experimentally determined data and, moreover, that more than 2 / 3 of the transferred torsional moment of the baffles as a whole is located in the above mentioned interference area...|$|E

The observation of the daily routine of any of Dakar's micro-businesses and its social aspects, reveals the wide <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interference</b> that exists between waged worker and the relation networks with family and relatives, ethnic groups and Muslim brotherhoods. The urban economy is supported by a network of family, alliance, and client relations. The overlap existing between waged and unwaged work can be understood only by looking closely at the network of social ties present outside the production site. Switching from the analysis of urban work relationships in Africa to the analysis of social networks is almost spontaneous, because a system of relational actions and strategies grows around the figure of the worker. The importance of the "strength of weak ties" in procuring employment is as a whole confirmed, but African sociability creates an intense inter-network relational interchange. Dakar's urban space feeds a "popular economy" where social networks and the gift-giving logic co-exist with market economy.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the processing of MagnetoEncephaloGraphic (MEG) signals before their further analysis for clinical purposes. An overview of recent methods that have been applied to brain signals is first presented. The <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interference</b> elimination is covered then, as the MEG signals suffer from the heart interfering magnetic field which in the majority of the experimental situations outweighs the signal of interest. The framework of a two step algorithm which first identifies the interference and then eliminates it by orthogonal projecting it to the contaminated signal is proposed. Next, the restoration of an MEG-like signal of interest buried in coloured noise is attempted by adopting a multi-model representation of the mixed signals. The noise is modelled an a autoregressive process and the deterministic signal of interest as a Markov Random process assuming piecewise linearity. The Simulated Annealing method is adopted for the restoration procedure. Furthermore, multi-resolution is used in order to accelerate the algorithm. Finally, a solution to the inverse solution is attempted by using the Singular Value Decomposition technique to decompose the measurement signal space to two subspaces, one dominated by the heart and another one dominated by the brain. Throughout the thesis results are presented with both synthetic and real data in order to illustrate the validity and usefulness of the proposed algorithms...|$|E

In general the risks are consequence either of the use of explosives or of induced erosive processes that could lead to pipeline instability. It is necessary to block the mining activities {{on both sides of the}} pipeline tracks in order to minimize risks to the pipeline, to others, to society, and to the environment. Also, the establishment of "flexible" track limits could be adopted in areas adjacent to the pipelines for the exploration of some mineral deposits, thus prioritizing security preservation with a minimum of socio-environmental impacts...|$|R

Weight increases due to the LFC systems cause increases in the operating empty weights of approximately 3 to 4 percent. The design takeoff gross weights decrease approximately 3 to 5 percent.

40|$|In {{non-destructive}} testing for cracks {{it is not}} sufficient to simply detect the presence of a defect, but it is essential to have an accurate measure of the depth. Accurate calibration of the techniques used to gauge defect size is therefore necessary. Recent progress in the field of non-contact ultrasonic testing has {{led to the development of}} a practically viable system for generating and detecting wideband Rayleigh waves on electrically conducting or magnetic samples using electro-magnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs). This system has been used to gauge the depth and position of surface breaking defects, and has many applications including metal billet testing and detecting and sizing gauge corner cracking in rails. In this paper we report experiments calibrating the response of EMATs when a defect is present between the generator and receiver, using a calibration sample with slots machined perpendicular to the surface to simulate surface breaking cracks. The depth of the defect can be gauged in the time domain and frequency domain, with an accurate 'fingerprint' of the position given by an enhancement of the signal when the receiver is close to the defect. The best choice of EMAT design for different applications is discussed, as is the best position for the receive EMAT to avoid <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>interference</b> between the Rayleigh wave and bulk waves diffracted from the crack tip.
