5|$|<b>Apical</b> {{periodontitis}} is acute {{or chronic}} inflammation around {{the apex of}} a tooth caused by an immune response to bacteria within an infected pulp. It does not occur because of pulp necrosis, meaning that a tooth that tests as if it's alive (vital) may cause <b>apical</b> periodontitis, and a pulp which has become non-vital due to a sterile, non-infectious processes (such as trauma) may not cause any <b>apical</b> periodontitis. Bacterial cytotoxins reach the region around {{the roots of the}} tooth via the <b>apical</b> foramina and lateral canals, causing vasodilation, sensitization of nerves, osteolysis (bone resorption) and potentially abscess or cyst formation.|$|E
5|$|Pseudoxenasma: corticioid; wax-like texture; gloeocystidia with spherical <b>apical</b> appendices; basidia {{developing}} laterally on hyphae (pleurobasidia); spores broadly ellipsoid {{to roughly}} spherical, with warty ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|Relatively few boletes have an <b>apical</b> pore at {{the distal}} {{end of their}} basidiospores. The dark reddish-brown, smooth spores of Porphyrellus amylosporus are {{truncate}} with a thin-walled depression. Some species of Heimioporus have spores with <b>apical</b> pores, but molecular analyses demonstrate that Heimioporus is only distantly related to Spongiforma.|$|E
5|$|According to Takahashi, the amyloid spores, the cheilocystidia {{covered with}} one or more, knob-like, <b>apical</b> excrescences, the diverticulate {{elements}} in the cortical layer of cap and stem, and the diverticulate caulocystidia suggest that the species is best classified in the section Fragilipedes, {{as defined by the}} Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Apical</b> abscesses {{can spread}} to involve {{periodontal}} pockets around a tooth, and periodontal pockets cause eventual pulp necrosis via accessory canals or the <b>apical</b> foramen {{at the bottom}} of the tooth. Such lesions are termed periodontic-endodontic lesions, and they may be acutely painful, sharing similar signs and symptoms with a periodontal abscess, or they may cause mild pain or no pain at all if they are chronic and free-draining. Successful root canal therapy is required before periodonal treatment is attempted. Generally, the long-term prognosis of perio-endo lesions is poor.|$|E
5|$|Mycena mustea {{is another}} similar Mycena that was {{discovered}} and reported concurrently with M.fonticola; it differs in forming a pale grayish purple cap {{with a low}} and broad umbo. Microscopically, it has club-shaped cheilocystidia with several <b>apical</b> short finger-like outgrowths, and nondiverticulate hyphae in the stem cuticle.|$|E
5|$|On the head, the {{occipital}} border either curves in or curves out, and no ocelli are present. The antennae {{consist of}} twelve segments. The mandibles each have {{six to eight}} teeth along with a large <b>apical</b> tooth.|$|E
5|$|Pulpitis is {{classified}} as reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts {{for a short time}} after a stimulus (for instance, cold or sweet); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and <b>apical</b> periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The <b>apical</b> abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary sinusitis, which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or angina pectoris, which can cause pain in the lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|Among lemurs, the toothcomb is {{variable}} in structure. Among indriids (Indriidae), the toothcomb is less procumbent {{and consists of}} four teeth instead of six. The indriid toothcomb is more robust and wider, with shorter incisors, wider spaces between the teeth (interdental spaces), and a broader <b>apical</b> ridge. It is unclear whether this four-toothed toothcomb consists of two pairs of incisors or one pair of incisors and one pair of canines. In fork-marked lemurs (Phaner) the toothcomb is more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces. All six teeth are longer, straighter, and form a more continuous <b>apical</b> ridge. In the recently extinct monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae) and sloth lemurs (Palaeopropithecidae), the toothcomb was lost and the incisors and canines resumed a typical configuration {{in the front of}} the mouth. The aye-aye also lost its toothcomb, replacing it with continually growing (hypselodont) front teeth, similar to the incisors of rodents.|$|E
5|$|Ascospores are {{ellipsoidal}} in shape, hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, with {{dimensions of}} 17–22 by 7–9µm. They are also biguttulate, containing two large oil droplets at either end. The spore-producing cells, the asci, are roughly cylindrical, eight-spored, operculate (opening by an <b>apical</b> lid to discharge the spores) and have dimensions of 200–350 by 12–17|µm. The {{diameter of the}} club-shaped paraphyses is 7–10µm at the apex.|$|E
5|$|MFGM {{phospholipid}} components such as phosphatidylcholine {{are a key}} constituent of {{the intestinal}} mucus barrier, and therefore may contribute to intestinal defense against invasive pathogens. Sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin, {{are present in the}} <b>apical</b> membrane of the gut epithelia, and are also important for maintaining membrane structure, modulating growth factor receptors, and serving competitive binding inhibitors for microorganisms, microbial toxins, and viruses. Gangliosides are also present in intestinal mucosa and may possibly contribute to improved gut microflora and antibacterial defense.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of C. graminis {{have four}} instar stages, though the first instar may not possess the {{characteristics}} of the later instars. Larvae are brown, and dorsally convex with spiracles evident on eight segments. They usually have small, indistinct tubercles with very short setae. The head of each larva is a darker brown than the body and has six ocelli on each side. The mandibles have five <b>apical</b> teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament becomes inflamed {{and there}} may be pain when biting or tapping on the tooth. On an X-ray, bone resporption appears as a radiolucent area around the end of the root, although this does not manifest immediately. Acute <b>apical</b> periodontitis is characterized by well-localized, spontaneous, persistent, moderate to severe pain. The alveolar process may be tender to palpation over the roots. The tooth may be raised in the socket and feel more prominent than the adjacent teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{two other}} {{luminescent}} species of Mycena section Exornatae {{are similar in}} appearance to M.chlorophos. M.discobasis fruit bodies have paler caps; microscopically, they have larger spores measuring 9.9 by 6.7μm, and lack the short <b>apical</b> appendage found on M.chlorophos cheilocystidia. M.margarita has smaller spores averaging 6.9 by 4.4μm, smaller cheilocystidia, and loop-like clamp connections.|$|E
25|$|The goblet cell {{is highly}} {{polarized}} with the nucleus and other organelles concentrated {{at the base}} of the cell and secretory granules containing mucin, at the <b>apical</b> surface. The <b>apical</b> plasma membrane projects microvilli to give an increased surface area for secretion.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{principle of}} plant organization based upon auxin distribution is <b>apical</b> dominance, {{which means the}} auxin produced by the <b>apical</b> bud (or growing tip) diffuses (and is transported) downwards and inhibits the development of ulterior lateral bud growth, which would otherwise compete with the <b>apical</b> tip for light and nutrients. Removing the <b>apical</b> tip and its suppressively acting auxin allows the lower dormant lateral buds to develop, and the buds between the leaf stalk and stem produce new shoots which compete to become the lead growth. The process is actually quite complex, because auxin transported downwards from the lead shoot tip has to interact with several other plant hormones (such as strigolactones or cytokinins) in the process on various positions along the growth axis in plant body to achieve this phenomenon. This plant behavior is used in pruning by horticulturists.|$|E
25|$|Cytokinins – Cytokinins {{regulate}} root <b>apical</b> meristem {{size and}} promote lateral root elongation.|$|E
25|$|There {{may be a}} {{distinction}} between laminal retroflex ṣ̌ and <b>apical</b> retroflex ṣ.|$|E
25|$|I− {{is moved}} across the <b>apical</b> {{membrane}} into the colloid of the follicle.|$|E
25|$|Seedling triple response, {{thickening}} and shortening of hypocotyl with pronounced <b>apical</b> hook.|$|E
25|$|In newt {{and general}} {{amphibian}} embryos, cell division {{is not a}} driving role in morphogenesis. Newt embryo cells are much larger and exhibit egg pigmentation to distinguish cells from each other. The newt neural plate doubles in length, decreases in <b>apical</b> width, and increases in thickness. The plate edges rise dorsally and fold toward the midline to form the neural tube. The <b>apical</b> surface area decreases.|$|E
25|$|PMD lacks <b>apical</b> corneal scarring, Rizutti's phenomenon, Munson's sign, and {{the central}} corneal {{thickness}} is usually normal.|$|E
25|$|Pteridophytes, like fern, on {{the other}} hand, do not possess a {{multicellular}} <b>apical</b> meristem. They possess a tetrahedral <b>apical</b> cell, which goes on to form the plant body. Any somatic mutation in this cell can lead to hereditary transmission of that mutation. The earliest meristem-like organization is seen in an algal organism from group Charales that has a single dividing cell at the tip, much like the pteridophytes, yet simpler.|$|E
25|$|A mid-diastolic {{rumbling}} murmur with presystolic accentuation will {{be heard}} after the opening snap. The murmur is best heard at the <b>apical</b> region and is not radiated. Since it is a low-pitch sound, it is heard best with the bell of the stethoscope. Its duration increases with worsening disease. Rolling the patient toward left as well as isometric exercise will accentuate the murmur. A thrill might be present when palpating at the <b>apical</b> region of the precordium.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} sinistral, not decollate, rather large, fusiform, solid, dark-brown, not translucent. <b>Apical</b> whorls are {{relatively}} broad. With 8-9 whorls, changing from apically moderately convex to somewhat flattened. <b>Apical</b> whorls are very finely, spirally punctated, the remaining ones with very fine, regular striae. The striae are rather faint above the aperture and not coarser on the neck. Suture is slightly indented. Neck is without a crest. Peristome is continuous, whitish, broadly reflexed and detached; basic margin {{more or less}} semicircular.|$|E
25|$|Aldosterone upregulates {{epithelial}} sodium channels (ENaCs) in the collecting duct and the colon, increasing <b>apical</b> membrane permeability for Na+ {{and thus}} absorption.|$|E
25|$|Dental, {{which means}} it is {{articulated}} with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the upper teeth, termed respectively <b>apical</b> and laminal.|$|E
25|$|Auxin induces shoot <b>apical</b> dominance; the {{axillary}} buds are inhibited by auxin, as a {{high concentration}} of auxin directly stimulates ethylene synthesis in axillary buds, causing inhibition of their growth and potentiation of <b>apical</b> dominance. When the apex of the plant is removed, the inhibitory effect is removed and the growth of lateral buds is enhanced. Auxin is sent to the part of the plant facing away from the light, where it promotes cell elongation, thus causing the plant to bend towards the light.|$|E
25|$|Postalveolar, {{which means}} it is {{articulated}} with either the tip or the blade of the tongue behind the alveolar ridge, termed respectively <b>apical</b> and laminal.|$|E
25|$|In chicken embryos, {{while the}} neural plate {{increases}} {{in length and}} decreases in <b>apical</b> width, {{the thickness of the}} plate does not change drastically. As the neural plate progresses through the Hamburger-Hamilton stages, the plate thickens until about HH6-7, when the neural plate begins to fold into tube form. The <b>apical</b> surface area increases during neurulation, unlike amphibian embryos. In mouse embryos, there is a large convex-shaped curve to each side of the middle of the plate. This curve has to be reversed as the plate rolls together to form the neural tube.|$|E
25|$|Alveolar, {{which means}} it is {{articulated}} with either the tip or, more rarely, the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, termed respectively <b>apical</b> and laminal.|$|E
25|$|In the surinamensis group, Ef. surinamensis and Ef. mexicana {{look very}} similar {{and it can}} be {{difficult}} to distinguish between the two. Ef. mexicana males have an elongate <b>apical</b> point of the subgenital plate that Ef. surinamensis males do not have. Also, the <b>apical</b> dorsal segment may be blue for Ef. mexicana, particularly for females. Ef. surinamensis females are never blue. However, some Ef. mexicana females are not blue, leaving the medial cell as the only way to distinguish between the two species. If darkened, the bee is of Ef. surinamensis, otherwise it is Ef. mexicana.|$|E
25|$|The other <b>apical</b> {{series is}} the retroflex, rt, rn, rl (or rd, rn, rl). Here {{the place is}} further back in the mouth, in the postalveolar or prepalatal region. The {{articulation}} is actually most commonly subapical; that is, the tongue curls back so that {{the underside of the}} tip makes contact. That is, they are true retroflex consonants. It has been suggested that subapical pronunciation is characteristic of more careful speech, while these sounds tend to be <b>apical</b> in rapid speech. Kalaw Lagaw Ya and many other languages in North Queensland differ from most other Australian languages in not having a retroflexive series.|$|E
25|$|Some {{languages}} contrast laminal denti-alveolar and <b>apical</b> alveolar nasals. For example, in the Malayalam pronunciation of Nārāyanan, {{the first}} n is dental, {{the second is}} retroflex, and the third alveolar.|$|E
25|$|Merozoites use the apicomplexan {{invasion}} organelles (<b>apical</b> complex, pellicle {{and surface}} coat) {{to recognize and}} enter the host erythrocyte (red blood cell). The parasite first binds to the erythrocyte in a random orientation. It then reorients such that the <b>apical</b> complex is in proximity to the erythrocyte membrane. The parasite forms a parasitophorous vesicle, to allow for its development inside the erythrocyte. This infection cycle occurs in a highly synchronous fashion, with roughly all of the parasites throughout the blood in the same stage of development. This precise clocking mechanism {{has been shown to}} be dependent on the human host's own circadian rhythm.|$|E
25|$|Fraser {{recorded}} {{the development of}} a single white spruce tree from 1926 to 1961. <b>Apical</b> growth of the stem was slow from 1926 through 1936 when the tree was competing with herbs and shrubs and probably shaded by larger trees. Lateral branches began to show reduced growth and some were no longer in evidence on the 36-year-old tree. <b>Apical</b> growth totalling about 340 m, 370 m, 420 m, 450 m, 500 m, 600 m, and 600 m was made by the tree in the years 1955 through 1961, respectively. The total number of needles of all ages present on the 36-year-old tree in 1961 was 5.25 million weighing 14.25kg. In 1961, needles as old as 13 years remained on the tree.The ash weight of needles increased progressively with age from about 4% in first-year needles in 1961 to about 8% in needles 10 years old. In discussing the data obtained from the one 11 m tall white spruce, Fraser et al. (1964) speculated that if the photosynthate used in making <b>apical</b> growth in 1961 was manufactured the previous year, then the 4 million needles that were produced up to 1960 manufactured food for about 600,000mm of <b>apical</b> growth or 730 g dry weight, over 12 million mm3 of wood for the 1961 annual ring, plus 1 million new needles, in addition to new tissue in branches, bark, and roots in 1960. Added to this would be the photosynthate to produce energy to sustain respiration over this period, an mount estimated to be about 10% of the total annual photosynthate production of a young healthy tree. On this basis, one needle produced food for about 0.19mg dry weight of <b>apical</b> growth, 3mm3 wood, one-quarter of a new needle, plus an unknown amount of branch wood, bark and roots.|$|E
