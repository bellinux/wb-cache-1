500|$|The {{photographer}} Charles Brittin, {{who knew}} Cameron on Los Angeles' artistic circuit, called her [...] "a sweet {{person with a}} great personality, not the way some of her friends wanted to picture her to be". Her friend Shirley Berman described her as having [...] "many different crowds of friends, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> was a different personality with each crowd... She wasn't an even personality at all, but she was always a very gracious person." ...|$|E
500|$|Early storylines between Pauline and her {{two teenage}} children, Mark and Michelle, show {{her to be a}} doting mother, {{forgiving}} of Mark's wayward behaviour, and supportive when Michelle decides to become a teenage mum. Pauline is devoted to her twin brother Pete, dutiful to her mother Lou, allegiant to her husband Arthur, and a shoulder for her nephew, Ian, to cry on. Wendy Richard commented in 1990, [...] "It's important for her to keep the family together. That's why when her problem son Mark suddenly came home , it was like her winning the pools ... She had {{to take a lot of}} shocks from Michelle <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> coped remarkably well." ...|$|E
500|$|Coulter {{has said}} that she grew up {{listening}} to artists such as Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, citing the latter as an influence. She has also named Michael Jackson and Beyoncé as influences, she told Cosmopolitan magazine, [...] " [...] so driven, she pushes herself to the limits and she's achieved so much but she's always looking for what that next thing is and how she can improve from what she's done in the past. She's really setting the benchmark for female artists <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> kind of is the Michael Jackson of this generation". Critics have compared Coulter's songs [...] "Do It Like That" [...] (2012) and its accompanying music video, as well as [...] "Giddyup" [...] (2014) to Beyoncé's work. Coulter has expressed admiration for other female artists such as Madonna, Pink, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry.|$|E

500|$|Faye and Joseph became {{engaged in}} series ten, much to Jac's displeasure. Roberts has relayed Marcel's insight that, [...] "Jac's left with very little. She hasn't got the {{consultancy}} post. Joseph's father {{is long gone}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> may be nostalgic for all of that. She's hankering after Joseph again. She wants him for herself." [...] He added, on Joseph's reaction to Jac's meddling in his relationship with Faye; [...] "He's a good guy but Jac brings out the evil in him. He does have a darker side. He will fight injustice with injustice." [...] In the episode [...] "Locked Away", Joseph and Jac are locked in theatre together– after being affected by an unknown poison– where they both reveal their true feelings for each other. Joseph admits that he still loves Jac, but would not take her back as she has hurt him too many times.|$|E
500|$|Delany {{compared}} Katherine's new realizations {{to that of}} actress Meredith Baxter, who {{realized she}} was a lesbian late in her life after entering into {{a relationship with a}} woman. Delany said she believed her character would be taken by surprise by the new feelings she is experiencing: [...] "I think that she’s still so emotionally vulnerable from getting out of the loony bin, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> and Robin connect on a kind of wounded, emotional level. And I think if anything, she’s feeling this kind of emotional solace with her, and that draws her to Robin in a physical way, and that’s confusing to her." [...] Delany and Benz were both sick when they filmed their kiss scene. Benz said of the scene, [...] "Dana's a great kisser." [...] Delany said more male crew members were present for the filming of the lesbian kiss scene than usual due to the sensuality of the scene.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Keri {{confirmed}} a clean {{version of}} the song would be included on her album. Some lyrical modifications were made. The line [...] "I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] was replaced by [...] "I got the kind of lovin' that'll keep you out the streets", and the word [...] "fuck" [...] was replaced with the word [...] "thug", while in others it was removed altogether. Ross told Jason Rodriguez of MTV News: [...] "When I got the record, I most definitely {{knew she was going}} to another level and I was excited for [...] I love to see the creative side. She's a sexy female <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> showed that. When I think of Janet Jackson when I was coming up and she was doing her Control thing, I loved it. So if that's the feeling that young people [...] or whoever is feeling the music, if that's the inspiration they get, I think it's dope." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Hyslop?" [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "Perhaps if she'd {{had a job}} for me I might have used {{an effort to get}} up speed. A charming girl, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> resolute." ...|$|R

500|$|Williams {{was giving}} up {{hope of finding}} Judy when she arrived in his new camp. [...] "I couldn’t believe my eyes. As I entered the camp, a scraggy dog hit me square between the {{shoulders}} and knocked me over! I’d never been {{so glad to see}} the old girl. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> felt the same!" [...] After four weeks at the new camp, they were moved back to Sumatra by paddle steamer. They had been told that it was a [...] "special mission" [...] to pick fruit. Instead they spent a year in Sumatra, with the Japanese using the men to cut through the jungle to lay railway track. Rations were a handful of maggot-ridden tapioca a day, which Frank continued to share with Judy. She also proved useful in conducting trades with the locals, as she would indicate when someone was hiding near to the track. Her barking deliberately alerted the guards to when there was something too large for her to handle in the jungle, such as tigers or elephants.|$|E
500|$|... "The Chase" [...] {{continued}} {{an ongoing}} storyline of Katherine Mayfair exploring her sexuality. The pairing of Katherine and Robin {{marks the first}} lesbian relationship in Desperate Housewives. Actress Dana Delany praised the subplot. She {{said she did not}} know if the character would become a lesbian permanently, because the story lines change so often in Desperate Housewives, but that series creator Marc Cherry [...] "is interested in playing the complexity of that". Delany compared Katherine's new realizations to that of actress Meredith Baxter, who realized she was a lesbian late in her life after entering into a relationship with a woman. Delany said she believed her character would be taken by surprise by the new feelings she is experiencing: [...] "I think that she’s still so emotionally vulnerable from getting out of the loony bin, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> and Robin connect on a kind of wounded, emotional level. And I think if anything, she’s feeling this kind of emotional solace with her, and that draws her to Robin in a physical way, and that’s confusing to her." ...|$|E
500|$|Francis also {{expressed}} her disappointment in her former daytime role on General Hospital. She {{said that she}} has found that her [...] "fan base will follow" [...] her whatever she does. She explained that, [...] "My job is not to disappoint , not to cheat them. And I feel like the last little appearance on GH cheated them. I welcome {{the opportunity to do}} something new to continue to entertain my audience. What I loved about Laura—and what people loved about Laura—is that she is a terrific memory, but it’s just not there anymore." [...] Soap Opera Digest later confirmed the character's name to be Genevieve Atkinson. Co-head writer of The Young and the Restless, Scott Hamner, stated that the role {{was going to be a}} [...] "very, very different character than we've seen Genie Francis portray". Bell opened up about hiring Francis, revealing: [...] "Genie is amazing and a real pro. I put pen and paper and she ran with it. She is really a brave, courageous actress" [...] and added that [...] "It really has been fantastic to watch, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> is terrific." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{not just}} that type, perhaps," [...] said Mrs. Hilary. [...] "But she is a good girl.

6000|$|... "Mrs. Marvin's dead. Elsie's {{with some}} friends at Spokane, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> well looked after. I've given up the stage.

5000|$|Prior to {{the sixth}} series, Lewis said of Liv, [...] "She's {{literally}} just being herself. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> after all the stuff last year, all the drama and stuff, she's completely forgotten about it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> grown up. They've all grown up, and they're just having fun. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's not really a complicated episode - not the beginning of it, anyway. They're literally just {{a group of friends}} finally just having fun without the drama, really.|$|R
500|$|As a final {{tribute to}} Pauline and Wendy Richard, the BBC aired a special {{television}} programme, EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline, which provided an emotional {{look back at}} Pauline's pivotal storylines during her time in Walford. It also reunited Wendy Richard with prior cast-mates Todd Carty and James Alexandrou (Mark and Martin respectively), and featured character commentary and tributes from television critics and EastEnders actors such as Anna Wing and Pam St. Clement (Lou and Pat). During the programme—which aired on New Year's Day, 2007—Wendy Richard reflected upon how [...] "proud" [...] she was of her character, commenting: [...] "Pauline had everything in life thrown at her <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> coped with it very well. It showed how people deal with their problems... She wasn't always grumpy... she did have lots of laughs, but sadly people don't seem to remember that, which is a shame... they still harp on about her wearing her cardigans and Pauline stopped wearing cardigans three years after EastEnders started. She is a good woman, she's a kind woman, a loving woman and all she ever thought about was her family. That {{was the most important}} thing in her life." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment Weiss spoke about Arya's story, saying [...] "Arya is in danger, she's got an open wound in her stomach, and the one person who has protected her to this point unfortunately gets murdered. The fact that the Many-Faced God gets {{the people who have been}} promised to him really makes you think that there's almost an inevitability about what happens to people who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm going to walk away,' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> knows what the answer's going to be. The implication, obviously, is that Jaqen was, on some level, rooting for the outcome that he got. He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells us something that we've kind of known all along, that she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E
500|$|Chrissie left Den but was {{eventually}} convinced {{to give their}} marriage another try. Oberman revealed in the Daily Mail that she drew on a famous real-life model to reconcile the dichotomous behaviour of a strong woman taking back her cheating husband: [...] "I based Chrissie on Hillary: an intelligent, attractive woman who was publicly humiliated. People ask why she stays with that awful man. A lot of strong women are like that." [...] She also saw {{the ebb and flow}} of Den and Chrissie's marriage as a reflection of the mental gameplaying that was so prominent in their characterisations: [...] "I think there's a challenge in it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> would like to be the one who would ultimately tame him." [...] As Den's equal, Chrissie was intended to be a challenge to his propensity for intellectual games, having already outwitted the show's prior , Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Den had seen little threat in his first wife's aptitude, but considered Chrissie to be [...] "as sharp as they come". Indeed, Den's extra-marital dalliances were used by writers to showcase and highlight Chrissie's [...] "strong-willed persona". When Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) chastised Den for caring only about Chrissie's reaction should she learn of their affair, Den fired back: [...] "And so should you. You think I've treated you badly? Well you don't have a clue what's going to happen if she ever finds out! The best thing you can do is keep your mouth shut." [...] By the time Chrissie left the Square, Oberman dryly observed that she had [...] "had more fights on EastEnders than most women have in their whole lives." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She has behaved admirably, mother," [...] he said; [...] "you must {{acknowledge}} that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> {{is entitled to}} all the kindness we can show her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A fine name, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> {{would be}} in haste to change it," [...] said the artist, {{wondering}} if Miss Dorothy Quincy was before him.|$|R
6000|$|... "It wouldn't be {{anything}} to wonder at. That Jennie Mason {{seemed to be}} a nice girl, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> would stand for any such meanness." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Linda was {{a wonderfully}} {{cooperative}} young lady that needed direction. Had no technique and no real acting experience. She {{was engaged to}} marry Dick Zanuck. So in Planet of the Apes they put her in with Frank Schaffner, then in mine, they underwrote her. They had nothing {{for her to do}} in this one, except just be part of the sequel. In other words, she was so badly conceived in the writing that I had to conceive actions for her to make her belong to the piece. And the big action which I gave her – <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> came off beautifully with it – was to try to understand what these people were trying to communicate to her. And struggling to understand and feeling sympathetic vibrations coming from these people. So I gave her something which was not in the script to play and she played that, I think, very simpatico, very beautifully." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Orwell {{was in the}} {{sanatorium}} in Kent, his wife's friend Lydia Jackson visited. He {{invited her}} for a walk {{and out of sight}} [...] "an awkward situation arose." [...] Jackson was to be the most critical of Orwell's marriage to Eileen O'Shaughnessy, but their later correspondence hints at a complicity. Eileen at the time was more concerned about Orwell's closeness to Brenda Salkield. Orwell had an affair with his secretary at Tribune which caused Eileen much distress, and others have been mooted. In a letter to Ann Popham he wrote: [...] "I was sometimes unfaithful to Eileen, and I also treated her badly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> treated me badly, too, at times, but it was a real marriage, {{in the sense that we}} had been through awful struggles together and she understood all about my work, etc." [...] Similarly he suggested to Celia Kirwan that they had both been unfaithful. There are several testaments that it was a well-matched and happy marriage.|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy spoke on several episode topics. About {{the timing of}} the episode's airdate with Hurricane Sandy's landfall, he said, [...] "It's very strange and somewhat sad. We wrote this script I think in June. We based it on several big 50s and 60s Nor'easters that hit the East Coast, obviously not as severe as the one that just hit. It's very eerie." [...] About Jessica Lange's performance, he said, [...] "She's never really played a drunkard in her career so her doing this big drunk monologue that has both comedy and tragedy sometimes within a single minute <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> just killed it. I think its really brilliant and tragic and it contains my favorite line she's ever said, which is 'Charles Laughton is an enormous whoopsie.' I thought that was really quite brilliant. Jessica Lange talking about Charles Laughton is just great. I know it was very challenging and she had a great time doing it. It was just a master class in acting." ...|$|E
50|$|After Leo Varadkar {{was elected}} Leader of Fine Gael and by {{extension}} Taoiseach-designate he was asked whether he would make his rival Simon Coveney Tánaiste. He confirmed he would keep Fitzgerald on, saying 'we have a Tánaiste, its Frances Fitzgerald <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> doing an excellent job'. Upon his appointment as Taoiseach, Varadkar kept Fitzgerald on as Tánaiste but moved her from Minister of Justice and Equality to Minister for Enterprise and Innovation. Charles Flanagan replaced her as Minister of Justice and Equality.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, {{in regard}} to her sexual orientation, Rose stated, [...] "I'm {{extremely}} open with my sexuality. I can {{be in love with}} a woman, I can be in love with a man. As far as humans go, I definitely find beauty in everybody, whether they're heavy-set, super-skinny, if they're white, black, Indian, Asian, Spanish. I can see beauty in anybody. If I see a woman <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> beautiful <b>and</b> <b>I</b> like her, <b>and</b> she likes me back we can definitely try to be in a relationship together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True, {{but money}} isn't {{everything}} in this life, Sam. I didn't look for money when <b>I</b> married Nellie, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> cared a rap how much I was worth." ...|$|R
2500|$|Due {{to having}} {{traveled}} internationally as a child, she learned English, Spanish and Danish fluently, {{and had a}} working knowledge of Portuguese and German. During her formative years, she showed no interest in acting. Miller said of her childhood, [...] "My mother was a professional singer <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> was eager {{for me to go}} into the entertainment field." [...] However, after she played a main role in her high school's production of George S. Kaufman's The American Way (1939), her taste for show business began to form. In one version of how she was discovered by Hollywood, in 1944 the 18-year-old Miller saw an opportunity when a Warner Brothers talent scout was to attend one of her school's performances. The scout never showed up, so she sent a letter and photograph to the studio, and garnered a screen test at Warner, where she changed her name to Kristine Miller. When Miller set out for Hollywood, she recalled, [...] "People said to my mother, 'Are you letting that girl go to that awful place?'" [...] But her mother replied, [...] "I know that girl, and she’ll be all right." [...] Although she failed the screen test, she was noticed by producer Hal Wallis, who was then feuding with the studio head, Jack L. Warner. Under acrimonious circumstances, Wallis left Warner Brothers for Paramount Pictures. Wallis brought with him Miller and another actress that also failed a screen test at Warner, the 21-year-old Lizabeth Scott.|$|E

5000|$|Series co-creator Ryan Murphy has {{admitted}} his {{obsession with the}} character of Marcy, the realtor, played by Christine Estabrook, who was more prominent in [...] "Open House". He stated, [...] "I love her! I love her! Every episode we're like 'We're killing Marcy this episode. This is the episode.' And then we get to writing her and she's too hilarious to kill. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> been {{a great source of}} levity <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> a terrible person. She's a racist and a homophobe and the worst realtor in the world. She's that incompetent bumbler. I like to imitate her in the writer's room." ...|$|R
5000|$|On January 5, 2015, Adam Carolla {{announced}} that Alison Rosen {{would no longer}} {{be a part of the}} show, explaining that she was a good comic lead, but not a good sidekick. Rosen was replaced by terrestrial radio personality Gina Grad, whom Adam considers a good sidekick and not necessarily a separate comedic voice. Remarking on the differences between Rosen and Grad Adam said, [...] "I think Alison Rosen is very talented <b>and</b> very funny. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she’s</b> a great writer <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she’s</b> a great comedic voice, but <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>she’s</b> a great sidekick ... <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> that’s her calling ... she's better as a lead than a sidekick." [...] About Grad, Carolla said she's great because, [...] "I don't need that much out of that role, I really don’t, I just need them to ... be there ... in a good mood and funny is nice ... but it’s not something that I’ve ever really needed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Gina fits in perfectly.” ...|$|R
