The shape of the glass from which beer {{is consumed}} can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style. Breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion, as this increases sales of their product.|$|E

5|$|The {{temperature}} of <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> has {{an influence on}} a drinker's experience; warmer temperatures reveal the range of flavours in <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> but cooler temperatures are more refreshing. Most drinkers prefer pale lager to be served chilled, a low- or medium-strength pale ale to be served cool, while a strong barley wine or imperial stout to be served at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|It is {{considered}} that overeating {{and lack of}} muscle tone is {{the main cause of}} <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> belly, rather than beer consumption. A 2004 study, however, found a link between binge drinking and <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> belly. But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself. Several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index of 110, the same as maltose; however, the maltose in beer undergoes metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose.|$|E

5|$|The starch {{source in}} <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> {{provides}} the fermentable material {{and is a}} key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin germination, and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars. Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.|$|E
