500|$|The {{presence}} of the league in Canberra has helped change {{the perception of the}} sport in the capital from an entertaining sideshow to a mainstream women's participation sport. The popularity of roller derby in Canberra has meant that the CRDL cannot accommodate <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> Canberra who want to participate. [...] To address this issue, in 2011, some roller derby enthusiasts worked on starting a new league as a student organisation at Australian National University.|$|E
500|$|Informed of this response, the city's leaders {{called an}} {{assembly}} {{to determine their}} course of action. They decided to liberate all slaves to secure their loyalty, to place all the children and their nurses in the gymnasium and to put <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the temple of Artemis. They also asked for everyone to bring forward their gold and silver and any clothes that were valuable so they could {{put them in the}} boats of the Rhodians and the Cyzicenes. Fifty elder and trusted men were elected to carry out these tasks. All the citizens then swore an oath. As Polybius writes: ...|$|E
500|$|Infuriated by Heydrich's death, Hitler {{ordered the}} arrest and {{execution}} of 10,000 randomly selected Czechs. But after consultations with Karl Hermann Frank, he altered his response. The Czech lands were an important industrial zone for the German military, and indiscriminate killing could reduce the region's productivity. Hitler ordered a quick investigation. Intelligence falsely linked the assassins to the towns of Lidice and Ležáky. A Gestapo report stated that Lidice, [...] north-west of Prague, was suspected as the assailants' hiding place because several Czech army officers, then in England, had come from there and the Gestapo found a resistance radio transmitter in Ležáky. On 9 June, after discussions with Himmler and Karl Hermann Frank, Hitler ordered brutal reprisals. Over 13,000people were arrested, deported, and imprisoned. Beginning on 10 June, all males {{over the age of}} 16 in the villages of Lidice and Ležáky were murdered. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> Ležáky were also murdered.|$|E

500|$|Oai {{first met}} Tokugawa Ieyasu {{at about the}} age of 17 or 18, when he visited the Saigō family and Oai served him tea. [...] It is {{believed}} she caught his eye on that occasion, but as she was still married, nothing came of it at the time. [...] Later, during the 1570s, it is believed that friendship and genuine affection developed between the two. [...] This view contradicts a common impression which maintains that Ieyasu was a ruthless leader who treated <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> his life, and all of his offspring, as commodities to be used as needed to serve the clan or his own ambitions. [...] However, it is also known that he valued personal merit over bloodlines. [...] During this time, Ieyasu had a house built in eastern Mikawa, far from the residence of his wife, the Lady Tsukiyama, in Okazaki. [...] The marriage between Ieyasu and Lady Tsukiyama had been arranged by her uncle, Imagawa Yoshimoto, ostensibly to help cement ties between the two clans, though Ieyasu found it difficult to live with his wife's jealousy, tempestuous moods, and eccentric habits.|$|E

2500|$|Steven Ned Myron III (Steve Agee) – Sarah's gay {{neighbor}} and friend, who is dating Brian. He makes wry comments on his partner's antics, or may even prompt them (such as by suggesting Tab {{could be a}} fine beverage). In the first episode, the sight of women in lingerie made him physically ill due to (or despite) the fact that Brian had pasted his face on <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the catalogue. Steve enjoys playing Halo 2 online. He is often assaulted by strangers, who claim that his face just makes them want to punch him. Steve is also known for having noxious, unbearable flatulence, which is noted in several episodes, particularly in the episode [...] "Not Without My Daughter", in which he sets off a SWAT team evacuation and is interrogated by the NSA after telling Brian over the phone that he has [...] "left a bomb" [...] in Jay's police car. Despite knowing karate, Brian usually lacks the will to stop people from punching Steve. Although Sarah and Laura have two friends that are named Steve, they nicknamed Steve [...] "Straight Steve" [...] to be ironic because he is gay. His family no longer speaks to him due to his homosexuality and relationship with Brian. He attended Valley Village High School with Sarah, Brian, and Laura. In the episode [...] "Nightmayor", he and Brian get married.|$|E
