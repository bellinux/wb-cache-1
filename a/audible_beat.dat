A magnet straddles the wire at one end. Wooden bridges are inserted under the wire at both ends to which contact microphones are imbedded, routed to a stereo sound system. The microphones pick up the vibrations that the wire imparts to the bridges and are sent through the playback system.

50|$|Residual {{high-frequency}} {{components of}} the signal remaining after de-multiplexing can be problematic when recording to analog magnetic media. While the higher frequencies are unlikely to survive filtering in the recording deck, the 19 kHz tone is within the 20 to 20,000 Hz frequency range for many tape formats, including compact cassette, and typically provides an <b>audible</b> <b>beat</b> (difference) tone {{in conjunction with the}} tape head bias signal used when recording. The recording may also be saturated by the pilot tone. More importantly, the pilot tone interferes with the proper functioning of noise reduction systems such as Dolby B, C and S. Because the pilot tone is relatively loud in comparison to the overall loudness of the FM program (typically -20dB), the source signal is not correctly processed by the noise reduction system, leading to audible artefacts such as breathing and pumping. For this reason many decks with defeatable MPX filters have been designed {{in such a way that}} the MPX filter can only be enabled when also a noise reduction system is enabled.|$|E
50|$|The {{simultaneous}} use of two equally-tuned pipes, of {{which one is}} blown with atmospheric air and the second with another gas, results in two only slightly different tones, called a beat. The function of the methane whistle {{is based on the}} fact that the sound when blowing a whistle depends on the speed of sound in the gas. The sound velocities of methane and air differ by about 31%. For a 1% methane-air mixture, the speed of sound is about 1.0031 times as high as in air. If the pipes are tuned to 440 Hz in air, the air-methane pipe has a frequency of 440 Hz × 1.0031 = 441.4 Hz. If two identically tuned pipes are blown by air and an air-methane mixture, the only slightly different tones produce a clearly <b>audible</b> <b>beat.</b> If the gas mixture changes in the resonator, then its resonance spectrum changes. By means of an absorber, interfering constituents of air such as humidity and carbon dioxide are removed. The methane whistle indicated methane levels in the mine air from 1 vol% and above.|$|E

The observer was paced by <b>audible</b> <b>beats</b> from a metronome. A naive observer can be used with this method. The observer is not mechanically limited and a minimum of observer training is required to obtain reliable measures.

40|$|Presented at the 22 nd International Conference on Auditory Display (ICAD- 2016) For {{the current}} {{diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's dementia (AD), physicians and neuroscientists primarily call upon visual and statistical analysis methods of large, multi-dimensional {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) brain scan data sets. As these data sets are complex in nature, the assessment of disease severity proves challenging, and is susceptible to cognitive and perceptual errors causing intra and inter-reader variability among doctors.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} tempo differences on listeners ' ability to recognize previously heard rhythm phrases. The effect of <b>audible</b> <b>beat</b> on subjects ' response accuracy also was examined. Three hundred twenty third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade students and nonmusic-major undergraduates heard one of two versions of a 20 -item paired-comparison test and indicated whether the second rhythm in each pair was the same or {{not the same as}} the first rhythm in the pair. In one test version, a second "voice " accompanied each rhythm at the rate of the steady beat. Rhythm performances at the rate of 100 beats per minute (bpm) were compared to performances at 50, 75, 125, and 150 bpm. The mean number of correct responses for undergraduates was significantly higher than the corresponding means for the third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade subjects, which were not sig-nificantly different from one another. Response accuracy across all groups was affected sig-nificantly both by the comparison tempo and by the direction of tempo change between the first and second rhythms in the test item. The mean number of correct responses for items with a 50 -bpm comparison tempo was significantly lower than the correct response means for items with 75 -, 125 -, and 150 -bpm comparison tempos, which did not differ significant-ly from one another. Subjects were better able to identify paired rhythms as identical when the tempo of the second rhythm was the faster of the two examples in the pair than when the second example was the slower of the two examples. There were no differences in response accuracy attributable to the presence (or absence) of an audible steady beat in the stimulus, and there were no significant interactions between main effects...|$|E
5000|$|A {{second problem}} was that the {{multiple}} radio frequency stages, all tuned to the same frequency, were prone to oscillate, and the parasitic oscillations mixed with the radio station's carrier in the detector, producing <b>audible</b> heterodynes (<b>beat</b> notes), whistles and moans, in the speaker.

40|$|A new {{mathematical}} {{theory for}} calculating the loudness of steady sounds from power summation and frequency interaction, based on psychoacoustic and physiological information, assuems that loudness is a subjective {{measure of the}} electrical energy transmitted along the auditory nerve to the central nervous system. The auditory system consists of the mechanical part modeled by a bandpass filter with a transfer function dependent on the sound pressure, and the electrical part where the signal {{is transformed into a}} half-wave reproduction represented by the electrical power in impulsive discharges transmitted along neurons comprising the auditory nerve. In the electrical part the neurons are distributed among artificial parallel channels with frequency bandwidths equal to 'critical bandwidths for loudness', within which loudness is constant for constant sound pressure. The total energy transmitted to the central nervous system is the sum of the energy transmitted in all channels, and the loudness is proportional to the square root of the total filtered sound energy distributed over all channels. The theory explains many psychoacoustic phenomena such as <b>audible</b> <b>beats</b> resulting from closely spaced tones, interaction of sound stimuli which affect the same neurons affecting loudness, and of individually subliminal sounds becoming audible if they lie within the same critical band...|$|R

[...] This mode was called an autodyne receiver. To receive radiotelegraphy, the feedback was increased until the tube oscillated, then the oscillation frequency was tuned {{to one side of the}} transmitted signal.

40|$|Since old {{churches have}} had heating installed, more {{complaints}} have arisen of organs sounding out of tune. Sound frequency of organ pipes {{is dependent on}} air temperature. Old churches tend to have very large volumes, so are typically heated just before and during services in wintertime, {{in order to reduce}} energy usage. Warm air plumes rise at radiators and spread out into the room, finally reaching the cold organ casing where they cause a non-uniform temperature distribution within. If pipes standing in different temperature zones are played {{at the same time the}} organ sounds out of tune due to clearly <b>audible</b> <b>beats</b> (interference between two slightly different frequencies). The purpose of this study was to design a ventilation system inside the organ casing, able to create a uniform temperature distribution around the pipes. A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model was developed for the St. Martin church in Oberesslingen, Germany. It was validated by on-site measurements that had been carried out in the organ casing of the church. Four organ divisions containing 300 - 500 pipes were represented by equivalent porous material zones. Their properties were determined using an auxiliary two-dimensional model of a staggered array consisting of 392 pipes.

40|$|Purpose: Many {{individuals}} exhibit biomechanical asymmetries during running. Yet, {{despite the}} prevalence, {{it is unknown}} how these biomechanical asymmetries affect metabolic cost. Altering biomechanical variables such as peak and stance average vertical ground reaction force (GRF) production, contact time, stride frequency, leg stiffness, and peak horizontal GRF production, all influence muscular demands that can change the metabolic cost of running and affect distance-running performance.

40|$|Introduction: In gymnastics, athletes perform {{twisting}} and flipping skills at high angular velocities. These athletes {{rely heavily on}} sensory information from the visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular systems. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is responsible for stabilizing the visual field on the retina during head movement. To accomplish this, the eyes are reflexively moved in a direction opposite the head. In a twisting gymnast, this actually reduces the ability of gymnasts to see the landing during airborne skills. Hence it becomes necessary for the gymnasts to cancel or suppress their VOR in order to view the landing. Objective: The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate the relationship between gymnastics skill level and their ability to suppress the VOR. Methods: Ten female gymnasts (mean age 15 ± 2. 2) were obtained via a sample of convenience from a local club. The sample included both competitive and recreational gymnasts. Subjects were asked to wear a measurement system that could track head and eye movements as they performed a series of visual tasks. Three experiments were performed: (1) a saccadic experiment – two horizontally fixed LEDs (± 10 °) were alternately lit in a non-predictable pattern to provide visual cues, (2) a VOR experiment – the subject was asked to perform yawl head movements to an <b>audible</b> metronome <b>beat</b> 11 while visually fixating on an LED target 1 m away, and (3) a vestibulo-ocular reflex suppression/cancellation (VORc) experiment – a laser pointer was fixed to the subject‟s helmet close to the cyclopean eye (slaving the target to the head movement) and the subject was again asked to perform head movements to a metronome while visually fixating on the target. In both VOR experiments, the metronome frequency varied from 72 to 196 beats per minute. Eye and head position data were synchronously sampled at 250 and 100 Hz respectively. Data were post-processed using MATLAB. Periodic calibrations were performed throughout the experiment to test the continued reliability of the data. Results: Saccadic peak velocities and latencies were calculated for the sample population. Their performance did not differ from the normal population. VOR and VORc gains were also calculated and compared. The higher level (competitive) gymnasts were better at suppressing their VOR. In addition, left/right VOR gain asymmetries correlated highly with twist direction in seven of the competitive gymnasts. Discussion/Conclusions: There is a correlation between VOR performance and gymnastic level. These results do not suggest that VOR differences develop as a result of practice. These differences may simply allow some individuals to become better performers. A longitudinal study on a larger population would be required to test the causal relationship between these variables...|$|R
40|$|Perinatal audit {{has been}} tested and proved an {{important}} tool for reduction of perinatal mortality and assessment of quality of perinatal care. At Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH), a tertiary hospital in Dar es salaam, Tanzania we performed a retrospective cross-sectional study using data from an obstetrics database to classify all perinatal deaths during 1999 - 2003. We also determined the prevalence of anaemia in pregnancy {{and its impact on}} perinatal outcome. Furthermore, we conducted a perinatal audit to study potential determinants and causes of perinatal and neonatal deaths and their avoidability. We also assessed the quality of care of patients admitted with eclampsia using a criteria based audit. Stillbirth, early neonatal and perinatal mortality rates (PMR) were 96, 27 and 124 respectively. A large proportion of foetuses (38 %) had no <b>audible</b> foetal heart <b>beat</b> on admission at MNH labour ward and the majority of the neonatal deaths were asphyxiated at delivery. The PMR for multiples and singletons were 269 and 118 respectively resulting in a rate ratio of 2. 4 (95 %CI: 2. 1 - 2. 4). The prevalence of anaemia and severe anaemia was 68 % and 5. 8 %, respectively. Severity of anaemia increased the risk of preterm delivery with ORs of 1. 4, 1. 4 and 4. 1 for women with mild, moderate and severe anaemia as compared to women with normal haemoglobin levels. The corresponding risks for LBW and VLBW were 1. 2, 1. 7 and 3. 8, and 1. 5, 1. 9 and 4. 2 respectively. The prevalence of preterm delivery and LBW was 17 % and 14 % respectively. The hospital-based incidence of eclampsia was 504 per 10, 000 women or 5. 1 % of all mothers admitted. Suboptimal care were identified on criteria regarding management plan by senior staff, review of the plans by specialist obstetrician, delay on caesarean section, monitoring patients on magnesium sulphate and inadequate use of the laboratory. Two out of three patients requiring operation were not operated within set standards. Birth asphyxia was the main cause of intrapartum fresh stillbirth (47 %) and early neonatal deaths (51 %), whereas eclampsia (25 %) and preeclampsia (8. 3 %) were main maternal medical conditions. The majority of stillbirths were fresh, indicating foetal demise during labour or just before delivery. The audit study identified suboptimal care in about 80 % of audited cases out of which about 50 % were found to be the likely cause of the adverse perinatal outcome. Inadequate maternal and foetal monitoring during labour were the main suboptimal factors, though delay in referral and operative interventions were also prominent. Based on these studies, we conclude that: The perinatal mortality (PMR) in this study was higher than the national average. About one in four perinatal deaths at MNH can be attributed to avoidable factors linked to obstetric care Main causes of perinatal and neonatal deaths were intrapartum birth asphyxia, immaturity related and infections            Management of patients in labour needs to be improved Suboptimal care that is essentially avoidable included: inadequate monitoring of patients during labour, delay of care,    e. g. long decision to surgery interval, and delayed referral of patients fromprimary hospitals The prevalence of anaemia in pregnancy was very high; and low birth weight and preterm delivery was independently associated with severity of anaemia The prevalence of eclampsia at MNH was high and the case management needs to be improve...|$|R
