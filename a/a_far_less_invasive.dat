40|$|The {{implementation}} of {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) at the nanoscale is a major challenge, as conventional systems require relatively large ensembles of spins and limit resolution to mesoscopic scales. New approaches based on quantum spin probes, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond, have recently achieved nano-NMR under ambient conditions. However, the measurement protocols require application of complex microwave pulse sequences of high precision and relatively high power, placing limitations on the design and scalability of these techniques. Here we demonstrate a microwave-free method for nanoscale NMR using the NV centre, which is <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>less</b> <b>invasive,</b> and vastly simpler measurement protocol. By utilising a carefully tuned magnetic cross-relaxation interaction between a subsurface NV spin and an external, organic environment of proton spins, we demonstrate NMR spectroscopy of ^ 1 H within a ≈(10 nm) ^ 3 sensing volume. We also theoretically and experimentally show that the sensitivity of our approach matches that of existing microwave control-based techniques using the NV centre. Removing the requirement for coherent manipulation of either the NV or the environmental spin quantum states represents a significant step towards the development of robust, non-invasive nanoscale NMR probes.

40|$|Mesothelioma {{is a form}} {{of cancer}} {{generally}} caused from previous exposure to asbestos. Although it was considered a rare neoplasm in the past, its incidence is increasing worldwide due to extensive use of asbestos. In the current practice of medicine, the gold standard for diagnosing mesothelioma is through a pleural biopsy with subsequent histologic examination of the tissue. The diagnostic tissue should demonstrate the invasion by the tumor and is obtained through thoracoscopy or open thoracotomy, both being highly invasive surgical operations. On the other hand, thoracocentesis, which is removal of effusion fluid from the pleural space, is <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>less</b> <b>invasive</b> procedure that can provide material for cytological examination. In this study, we aim at detecting and classifying malignant mesothelioma based on the nuclear chromatin distribution from digital images of mesothelial cells in effusion cytology specimens. Accordingly, a computerized method is developed to determine whether a set of nuclei belonging to a patient is benign or malignant. The quantification of chromatin distribution is performed by using the optimal transport-based linear embedding for segmented nuclei in combination with the modified Fisher discriminant analysis. Classification is then performed through a k-nearest neighborhood approach and a basic voting strategy. Our experiments on 34 different human cases result in 100 % accurate predictions computed with blind cross validation. Experimental comparisons also show that the new method can significantly outperform standard numerical feature-type methods in terms of agreement with the clinical diagnosis gold standard. According to our results, we conclude that nuclear structure of mesothelial cells alone may contain enough information to separate malignant mesothelioma from benign mesothelial proliferations. © 2015 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry...|$|E

40|$|Preterm birth (PTB), {{defined as}} a {{delivery}} at less than 37 weeks of gestation, {{is the leading cause}} of perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. The serious effects of PTB on parents, infant and society make PTB an important issue to public health. Despite significant advances in perinatal care and advancing knowledge of risk factors and mechanisms associated with PTB, there has been little progress in reducing the PTB rate. Diagnosis of preterm labour as well as accurate prediction of PTB is notoriously difficult, because of the heterogeneity of the condition. PTB is a syndrome initiated by multiple mechanisms including infection or inflammation which is the only pathological process for which both a firm causal link with PTB has been established and a molecular pathophysiology defined. Intrauterine infection evokes an immune response that involves the release of cytokines and chemokines, prostaglandins and matrix-degrading enzymes. These substances trigger uterine contractions, membrane rupture and cervical ripening. Most intra-uterine infections are chronic and subclinical in nature and consequently hard to diagnose before labour or rupture of the membranes. A tremendous amount of efforts has been expended to identify markers to predict PTB and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms and pathways leading to PTB. The best studied site of infection is amniotic fluid, but obtaining this sample requires an invasive and sometimes risky procedure (e. g. amniocentesis). A non-invasive approach seems to be more relevant to clinical practice because of the feasibility and accessibility. However, few studies have investigated the maternal inflammatory response during preterm labour. Therefore, the overall objective of this study was to determine several inflammatory markers in maternal serum from pregnant women in labour (either term or preterm) vs. non-labouring controls. We completed a nested case control study in which singleton pregnancies were recruited at the obstetric department of Ghent University Hospital and divided into groups according to gestational age and labour status. Multiple proteins were evaluated in maternal serum using enzyme-linked or multiplex bead immunoassays including soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells- 1 (sTRE M- 1), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) - 9 and MMP- 3, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) - 1, TIMP- 2, TIMP- 3 and TIMP- 4 and a panel of 30 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Our study showed that serum levels of sTRE M- 1 were elevated during spontaneous term and preterm labour vs. non-labouring women. sTRE M- 1 concentrations were significantly higher in preterm vs. term labour. In line with previous studies, MMP- 9 concentrations were elevated during preterm labour. TIMP- 1 and TIMP- 2 were lower in preterm gestation, irrespective of labour, while TIMP- 4 concentrations were raised in labour. One of the most intriguing findings of our study is that MMP- 9 :TIMP- 1 and MMP- 9 :TIMP- 2 balances in maternal serum were tilting in favour of matrix degradation (gelatinolysis) in women with preterm labour. This observation suggests that aberrant serum expression of MMP:TIMP ratios may provide <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>less</b> <b>invasive</b> method to determine enzymes essential in the degradation of extracellular matrix (EC M) during pregnancy and parturition. Among the 30 inflammatory serum markers, only hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was increased in women with PTB, while interleukin (IL) - 12 serum levels were lower in labouring women and interferon gamma induced protein (IP) - 10 serum levels were higher in women at term gestation. This may indicate that the inflammatory response in serum of women with term and preterm labour is rather weak. Until present, few biomarkers have shown clinical usefulness, because they are nonspecific or become positive too late. Among the biomarkers evaluated to date, the most powerful and consistent predictors of PTB are the presence of foetal fibronectin in cervicovaginal fluid and a short cervix on transvaginal ultrasound examination. The clinical value of both tests primarily lies in their negative predictive value thereby guiding clinicians in decision-making and avoiding unnecessary interventions. During the last decades, it has become clear that single or universal biomarkers will not be capable to predict PTB accurately in all populations. Future research should focus on multiple biomarkers in different PTB subtypes to allow differentiation depending on the underlying causes. The future development of an accurate, minimally invasive multiple marker test is necessary to permit incorporation into clinical practice. The availability of new technologies capable of probing the genome offers exciting possibilities to gain new insights into the mechanisms leading to PTB and to develop targeted therapies...|$|E
