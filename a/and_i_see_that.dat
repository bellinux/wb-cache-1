5|$|C: Well, if {{by chance}} {{one of a}} million of the people believe you that they {{committed}} suicide in church <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they have not committed suicide and I know differently, then if it ever leaks out, I am in trouble.|$|E
5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
2500|$|Part 2, pages 51–53, dated July 1878, {{had another}} note {{attached}} to it: [...] "I've sealed the previous fifty pages {{in an envelope}} as finished. But {{in the course of}} the last 2.5 years lots of things have happened related to this case <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> having once started, I need to continue..." [...] There is an inscription on the envelope: [...] "These papers which have to do with me personally, I commit to Sophia Aleksandrovna Nikitenko for her to deal with them as I asked her to. Ivan Goncharov, May 19, 1883".|$|E
60|$|And {{he looks}} at me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> he had got it in the neck, right enough.|$|R
6000|$|... "Make {{yourself}} easy, brother; Ronald <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>see</b> to <b>that.</b> When once treachery {{is known}} {{it is easy}} to defeat, <b>and</b> Ronald <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>see</b> <b>that</b> your name does not appear in the matter." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} head away, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she was crying.|$|R
2500|$|We {{have never}} dreamt of {{incorporating}} into our Union any but the Caucasian race—the free white race. To incorporate Mexico, {{would be the}} very first instance of the kind, of incorporating an Indian race; {{for more than half}} of the Mexicans are Indians, and the other is composed chiefly of mixed tribes. I protest against such a union as that! Ours, sir, is the Government of a white race.... We are anxious to force free government on all; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it has been urged ... that it is the mission of this country to spread civil and religious liberty over all the world, and especially over this continent. It is a great mistake.|$|E
6000|$|On the 16th, we {{were still}} debating the {{character}} of our hero; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> I suggested [...] "a man of the Charley Buswell type." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You told me {{that you}} had {{bachelor}} quarters for one, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> you have no gentleman visitor at present. Your hat-stand proclaims as much." ...|$|E
60|$|Grace turned pale, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{her sweet}} countenance became {{thoughtful}} and repentant.|$|R
60|$|Grace's cheeks flushed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she was {{extremely}} gratified, though still tremblingly anxious.|$|R
60|$|At this, I {{began to}} feel uneasy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> my wife shared my trouble.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{words are}} strange to me," [...] quoth Sir Nigel, [...] "for {{you have the}} {{appearance}} of a stout man, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> you wear a sword by your side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{one point}} I {{would like to}} mention, Mr. Archdeacon. His lordship asked me to step through the premises, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the stalls in the second stable are not perfect." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now I {{pierce the}} darkness, new beings appear, [...] The earth recedes from {{me into the}} night, [...] I {{saw that it was}} beautiful, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> what is not the earth is [...] beautiful.|$|E
60|$|It {{was bright}} starlight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{we were making}} a {{complete}} circuit in the smooth water.|$|R
5000|$|You dont {{treat them}} with contempt, you treat them with respect - <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didnt <b>see</b> <b>that</b> from the Aussies ...|$|R
60|$|The figure glided yet nearer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it was trembling, and now {{its arms}} were {{extended}} also.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I prythee do {{not bring}} him,' said I. 'I {{am one of}} a dissenting stock, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> there is a Bible in yonder recess. No man can aid me in making my peace with God.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have done}} excellently, Wilfrid," [...] his father said, putting {{his hand on}} his shoulder. [...] "Mr. Mitford here has been telling me how energetically you have been working, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the house has made {{wonderful}} progress." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, no," [...] {{returned}} Captain Fitzgerald, laughing, [...] "not altogether {{right as}} to the duties of officers of the British navy. However, you're right as to my object, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> this pirate is no friend of yours." ...|$|E
60|$|Rupert's {{surprise}} was now more natural, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> his interest--shame on our propensities for it!--was very natural, too.|$|R
50|$|Jester: Wait! Important news {{comes from}} the Queen, a new baby! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> have <b>seen,</b> <b>that</b> she is well, and doing fine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> you're {{a provincial}} one," [...] replied Billy, {{jingling}} the half-crown against the silver in his pocket.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Benoni scanning his visitor, [...] "I knew Hilliel--a clever man, but one {{who fell}} into a trap at last, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> you are his son. Your face proves it; indeed, it might be Hilliel who stands before me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{one thing}} I can save you." [...] She {{looked at him}} with diffident eagerness. [...] "I've been {{thinking}} a good deal lately, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> if wheat keeps getting cheaper it may be serious for us all. Couldn't we take precautions?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They may be {{well when}} they come,' said Felix in answer: 'but I {{have thought it}} over well to-night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> to do {{anything}} doubtfully right for their sake would be a risk for all that I {{have no right to}} run.' ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{there was}} a short silence, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she was crying under her veil. I laid my hand upon hers.|$|R
60|$|The man's brow grew {{black with}} anger. He was very angry, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{it was with}} {{difficulty}} he kept his hands off me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{they must}} be punished," [...] said Mr. George. [...] "You shall {{determine}} what the punishment shall be, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it is inflicted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{need the}} bath {{almost as much}} as I need a feed," [...] Harry laughed. [...] "I have just been looking into the glass, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> I am well-nigh as dark as when I came to you, nine or ten days ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't see how I {{could come}} down here without the others. Aunt Lily won't let me come alone, and though it is holiday time, that is no good, for those horrid boys are always about, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Jasper {{is going to be}} worse even than Wilfred.|$|E
6000|$|... "Besides, I {{have been}} {{thinking}} over things alone in my room; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it is better {{for him to be}} free. I know he was disappointed in me. He is not the sort of man to be tied down to such an ignorant woman as I." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The young one, at least, seems {{a little}} ashamed of her errand.... Now, Wulf, speak low; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>see</b> <b>that</b> no one is {{listening}} at the door.' ...|$|R
60|$|I glanced {{towards the}} table. As I had expected, de Cartienne was {{watching}} us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he was straining every nerve to overhear our conversation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{repeated}} all her own three; Jock adding [...] "Father {{would have}} known {{it as soon as}} you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>see</b> <b>that</b> my uncle is much worse." ...|$|R
