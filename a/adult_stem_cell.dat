25|$|The use {{of adult}} stem cells in {{research}} and therapy is not as controversial {{as the use of}} embryonic stem cells, because the production of {{adult stem cells}} does not require the destruction of an embryo. Additionally, in instances where adult stem cells are obtained from the intended recipient (an autograft), the risk of rejection is essentially non-existent. Consequently, more US government funding is being provided for <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research.|$|E

However, Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research. On August 9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing [...] "lines" [...] of stem cells, but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned. Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines, and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines. On July 19, 2006, Bush used his veto power {{for the first time in}} his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act.

30|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>cells</b> drive normal {{development}} and play many roles in adult tissue regeneration [11]. Pluripotent <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> capable of {{giving rise to}} any cell lineage can be isolated from early stage mammalian embryos. These embryonic <b>stem</b> (ES) <b>cells</b> maintain pluripotency when cultured in the right conditions [12]. As development progresses, lineage-restricted <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> produce the tissues and organs of the body. Development does not necessarily exhaust <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> pools, and often leads {{to the formation of}} tissue-specific or so-called <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> that are maintained throughout life. <b>Adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> typically show more restricted potency (e.g. they are multi-, bi, or unipotent), and have been discovered in diverse creatures from simple metazoans like flies to mammals like mice and humans [13]. In fact, <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> have been reported in a substantial list of human tissues and organs. <b>Adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> can act to replace cells that have a naturally limited lifespan, thus serving to maintain the integrity of the soma. Further, many <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> can respond dynamically to injury and fuel substantial regeneration of damaged tissues. For these reasons, <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are thought to have profound impacts on the etiology of disease, malignancy, and aging [14, 15]. Research efforts to identify regenerative therapeutics have encompassed the study of ES <b>cells,</b> <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> and the pursuit of reprogramming methods to manipulate differentiated cells and obtain induced pluripotent <b>stem</b> (iPS) <b>cells</b> that have broad lineage potential similar to the ES cell [12].|$|R

40|$|Background: The origin, {{function}} and physiology of totipotent embryonic cells are configured to construct organs and create cross-talk between cells for {{the biological and}} neurophysiologic development of organisms. <b>Adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are involved in regenerating tissues for renewal and damage repair. Findings: <b>Adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> have been isolated from adult tissue, umbilical cord blood and other non-embryonic sources, and can transform into many tissues and cell types in response to pathophysiological stimuli. Clinical applications of <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and progenitor cells have potential in the regeneration of blood cells, skin, bone, cartilage and heart muscle, and may have potential in degenerative diseases. Multi-pluripotent <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> can change their phenotype in response to transdifferentiation or fusion and their therapeutic potential could include therapies regulated by pharmacological modulation, for example mobilising endogenous <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and directing them within a tissue to stimulate regeneration. <b>Adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> could also provide a vehicle for gene therapy, and genetically-engineered human <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> have shown success in treatment of genetic disease. Conclusion: Deriving embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> from early human embryos raises ethical, legal, religious and political questions. The potential uses of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> for generating human tissues {{are the subject of}} ongoing public debate. <b>Stem</b> <b>cells</b> must be used in standardised and controlled conditions in order to guarantee the best safety conditions for the patients.

50|$|The immortal DNA strand {{hypothesis}} was proposed in 1975 by John Cairns {{as a mechanism}} for <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> to minimize mutations in their genomes. This hypothesis proposes that instead of segregating their DNA during mitosis in a random manner, <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> divide their DNA asymmetrically, and retain a distinct template set of DNA strands (parental strands) in each division. By retaining {{the same set of}} template DNA strands, <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> would pass mutations arising from errors in DNA replication on to non-stem cell daughters that soon terminally differentiate (end mitotic divisions and become a functional cell).

On August 9, 2001, before any funding was granted under these guidelines, Bush announced modifications to the guidelines to allow use of only existing stem cell lines.

50|$|In the label-release assay, {{the goal}} is to mark the newly {{synthesized}} DNA that is normally passed on to the daughter (non-stem) cell.

2500|$|Discoveries {{in recent}} years have {{suggested}} that adult stem cells might have the ability to differentiate into cell types from different germ layers. For instance, neural stem cells from the brain, which are derived from ectoderm, can differentiate into ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Stem cells from the bone marrow, which is derived from mesoderm, can differentiate into liver, lung, GI tract and skin, which are derived from endoderm and mesoderm. This phenomenon is referred to as stem cell transdifferentiation or plasticity. It can be induced by modifying the growth medium when stem cells are cultured in vitro or transplanting them to an organ of the body different from the one they were originally isolated from. There is yet no consensus among biologists on the prevalence and physiological and therapeutic relevance of stem cell plasticity. More recent findings suggest that pluripotent stem cells may reside in blood and adult tissues in a dormant state. These cells are referred to as [...] "Blastomere Like Stem Cells" [...] (Am Surg. 2007 Nov;73:1106-10) and [...] "very small embryonic like" [...] – [...] "VSEL" [...] stem cells, and display pluripotency in vitro. As BLSC's and VSEL cells are present in virtually all adult tissues, including lung, brain, kidneys, muscles, and pancreas Co-purification of BLSC's and VSEL cells with other populations of adult stem cells may explain the apparent pluripotency of <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> populations.
