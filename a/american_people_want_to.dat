40|$|The <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> reclaim and reassert {{the spiritual}} {{dimension}} in dying. ” 1 This {{was the major}} conclusion of {{a recent survey of}} 1, 200 adults, 18 years or older, conducted in the United States during May 1997 (and completed before the June 1997 Supreme Court decision on physician-assisted sui-cide). Spirituality has been defined as “ [...] . that which allows a person to experience transcendent meaning in life. This is often expressed as a relationship with God, {{but it can also be}} about nature, art, music, family, or community—whatever beliefs and values give a person a sense of meaning and purpose in life. ” 2 So, every person, regardless of any commitment to a particular religious faith, has a real spirituality inasmuch as one experiences meaning and purpose in life. It is the real and immediat...|$|E
40|$|The Great Depression in the United States {{was largely}} {{the result of}} changes in {{economic}} institutions that lowered the normal or steady-state market hours per person over 16. The difference in steady-state hours in 1929 and 1939 is over 20 percent. This is a large number, but differences of this size currently exist across the rich industrial countries. The somewhat depressed Japanese economy of the 1990 s {{could very well be}} the result of workweek length constraints that were adopted in the early 1990 s. These constraints lowered steady-state market hours. The failure of the Japanese people to display concern with the performance of their economy suggests that this reduction is what the Japanese <b>people</b> <b>wanted.</b> This is in sharp contrast with the United States in the 1930 s when the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> work more.

50|$|The {{revelation of}} true {{intelligence}} secrets makes exciting {{reading in the}} morning paper. It is soon forgotten by most readers, but not by our adversaries. Enormously complex and expensive technical intelligence collection systems can be countered. Need I remind this particular audience that dedicated and courageous {{men and women who}} risk their lives to help America can be exposed and destroyed? I don't think the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> this <b>to</b> happen especially when our adversaries dedicated to the proposition that we eventually must be defeated-are hard at work. But Americans must understand or they will inadvertently cause this to happen.|$|R

I'm going to say this again: I did not have sexual {{relations}} with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie, not a single time; never. These allegations are false.

40|$|Indigenous Resistance Day was {{established}} by decree of October 10, 2002 in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. With regard to the new readings of {{the true story of}} the Latin <b>American</b> <b>people</b> we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> establish some of the philosophical foundation that should support such events beyond the simplistic view. For this we contextualized our resarch in the Venezuelan Tachira geomental to decant the features of the mental tooling that we inherited from our mestizo past. The Day of Indigenous Resistance in Tachira has the connotation of being the days of cultural resistance because little or nothing has become of our indigenous brothers. Therefore, this date should be returned to the cultural preservation of how little we had as a culture aborted, and vigilant awareness is imminent for failing to succumb to the imposition of anglobalización...|$|R

Obama condemned Bush's veto, saying, [...] "Democrats <b>want</b> this bill <b>to</b> pass. Conservative, pro-life Republicans <b>want</b> this bill <b>to</b> pass. By large margins, the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> this bill <b>to</b> pass. It is only the White House {{standing in the way of}} progress – standing in the way of so many potential cures."

However, it's finished. The Hague Conference is broken up. The official organs of the world allude to it, if at all, as an unimportant gathering called together to discuss certain frontier questions with which England had nothing to do. But the memory of it will live. A good cold douche for you people, I should say, and I hope you'll take warning by it.

Before he departs, he privately orders his Japanese interpreter, Takahashi, to locate his Japanese girlfriend, Aya Shimada. After arresting Tojo, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur informs Fellers Emperor Hirohito can be tried as a war criminal. Doing so could lead to a revolt, but the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> the Emperor <b>to</b> stand trial for Japan's actions. MacArthur gives Fellers ten days to investigate the Emperor.

5000|$|Kissell's {{first act}} in Congress was to {{co-sponsor}} {{a bill to}} reverse a planned Congressional pay raise. On February 13, 2009, Dan Eggen and Ellen Nakashima of the Washington Post wrote that the compromise stimulus bill included a provision introduced by Kissell that would; “require the Transportation Security Administration to purchase uniforms manufactured in the United States; most TSA clothing is currently assembled in Mexico and Honduras from U.S.-made fabric.” [...] In March 2010, Kissell voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, saying, [...] "I kept my word." [...] In January 2011, Kissell voted against repealing the law. His vote angered some constituents in his district; the Washington Post noted that a year after his election, [...] "the euphoria {{has given way to}} second thoughts at best and outright rebellion at worst." [...] Michael Lawson, an African-American democratic leader from his constituency, stated the people believed they would receive one outcome and got another with his vote on health care. He explained the latter vote as follows: “let everybody vote, and then let's focus on the economy and get people back to work,because that's what the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> us <b>to</b> do.” ...|$|R

40|$|Peterson, {{the many}} {{distinguished}} {{officials of the}} Republican Party gathered for this Midwest regional meeting. It's indeed a pleasure {{for me to be}} here tonight. I had intended to make all three of the regional meetings that have been scheduled thus far, but unfortunately I had to scrub the Western one [...] Hawaii was a little far at the moment, that time. But I'm glad to be here tonight and I look forward to attending the others. I think it's obvious from the cameras here that I didn't come to discuss the ban on cyclamates or DDT. I have a subject I think is of great interest to the <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> Tonight I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> discuss the importance of the television medium to the <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> No nation depends more on the intelligent judgment of its citizens. And no medium has a more profound influence over public opinion. Nowhere in our system are there fewer checks on such vast power. So nowhere should there be more conscientious responsibility exercised than by the news media. The question is, "Are we demanding enough of our television news presentations? " "And are the men of this medium demanding enough of themselves?" Monday night, a week ago, President Nixon delivered the most important address of his Administration, {{one of the most important}} of our decade. His subject was Vietnam. My hope, as his at that time, was to rally the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> to see the conflict through to a lasting and just peace in the Pacific. For 32 minutes, he reasoned with a nation that has suffered almost a third of a million casualties in the longest war in its history. AmericanRhetoric. co...|$|R

5000|$|The courtiers of the Shah's court {{were devoted}} to {{stroking}} his ego, competing about who {{could be the most}} sycophantic with Mohammad Reza being regularly assured he was a greater leader than his much admired General de Gaulle, that democracy was doomed, and based on Rockefeller's speech that the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>wanted</b> Mohammad Reza <b>to</b> be their leader as well as he doing such a great job as Shah of Iran. All of this praise boosted Mohammad Reza's ego, who went from being a merely narcissistic man to a megalomaniac, believing himself a man chosen by Allah Himself to transform Iran and create the [...] "Great Civilization". Befitting all this attention and praise, Mohammad Reza started to make increasing outlandish claims for the [...] "Great Civilization", telling the Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci in a 1973 interview: [...] "Halfway measures, compromises, are unfeasible. In other words, either one is a revolutionary or one demands law and order. One can't be a revolutionary with law and order. And even less with tolerance ... when Castro came to power, he killed at least 10, 000 people ... in a sense, he was really capable, because he's still in power. So am I, however! And I intend to say there, and to demonstrate that one can achieve a great many things by the use of force, show even that your old socialism is finished. Old, obsolete, finished ... I achieve more than the Swedes ... Huh! Swedish socialism! It didn't even nationalize forests and water. But I have ... my White Revolution ... is a new original kind of socialism and ... believe me, in Iran we're far more advanced than you and we really have nothing to learn from you". In an interview with Der Spiegel published on 3 February 1974, Mohammad Reza declared: [...] "I would like you to know that in our case, our actions are not just to take vengeance on the West. As I said, {{we are going to be}} a member of your club". On March 31, 1974, Mohammad Reza predicated in a press conference what Iran would be like in 1984, saying: [...] "In the cities, electric cars would replace the gas engines and mass transportation systems would be switched to electricity, monorail over the ground or electric buses. And, furthermore, in the great era of civilization that lies ahead of our people, there will be least two or three holidays a week." [...] In 1976, Mohammad Reza told the Egyptian journalist Mohamed Hassanein Heikal in an interview: [...] "I want the standard of living in Iran in ten years' time to be exactly on a level with that in Europe today. In twenty years' time we shall be ahead of the United States".|$|R
