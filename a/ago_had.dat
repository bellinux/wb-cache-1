Meanwhile, Marius realizes that the band of barbarians he encountered years <b>ago</b> <b>had</b> invaded Rome and slain his father at Nero's instigation {{as a means of}} eliminating a political rival. Furthermore, the Celts, led by a just-escaped Boudica, lay siege to York, with XIV Legion tasked with defending it until Commodus can escape. In the end, Marius sacrifices himself to buy time for the final ships to sail, but is resurrected by the goddess Summer, who tasks him with taking on the mantle of Damocles, a legendary Roman general who was abandoned to his enemies for political expediency. In that guise, Summer tells him to avenge his family and comrades, and save Rome.|$|E

25|$|An {{analysis}} {{published on}} 21 July 2014 based on observations by the ESO's Very Large Telescope in Chile concluded alternatively that the cloud, {{rather than being}} isolated, might be a dense clump within a continuous but thinner stream of matter, and would act as a constant breeze on the disk of matter orbiting the black hole, rather than sudden gusts that would have caused fireworks as they hit, as originally expected. Supporting this hypothesis, G1, a cloud that passed near the black hole 13 years <b>ago,</b> <b>had</b> an orbit almost identical to G2, consistent with both clouds, and a gas tail thought to be trailing G2, all being denser clumps within a large single gas stream.|$|E

500|$|Lava flows emitted during future {{volcanic}} eruptions {{would likely be}} basaltic in nature based on the composition of its lavas produced during past volcanic activity.

This would again have disastrous consequences for fish habitats and spawning grounds. However, there are neither records of any impacts on people during this eruption, nor evidence that it was even witnessed by people. A repeat of wildfires in the Lava Fork valley is also a possibility due to the existence of vegetation on and around the erupted lavas.|$|E

Sachs insists on retaining complexity (geography, technological progress, etc.) in explaining differences in economic performance, rather than just simplifying to one factor (institutions). As Sachs describes, {{the evidence suggests that}} economic development is a multidimensional dynamic process, in which political, institutional, technological, cultural, and geographic factors all play a role.
