40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density on some morphological and agronomic characteristics of grain sorghum in the years 2001 - 2002. Experimental design was a split-split, randomized complete block with three replications. Three nitrogen levels (0, 75 and 150 kg ha - 1) <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> densities (70 x 10, 70 x 20 and 70 x 30 cm) were applied in three grain sorghum cultivars. Generally, nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density had no effect on <b>plant</b> height <b>and</b> stalk length. The effect of nitrogen on grain yield per plant was usually non-significant <b>and</b> increased <b>plant</b> densities tended to increase grain yield per <b>plant.</b> Both nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density have positively affected grain yield per unit area. The effects of cultivar, nitrogen level <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density on flag leaf area were changeable and dependent on both years and locations. One thousand grain weight was mainly determined by both cultivar <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density. It may be concluded that increased nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density levels generally give the best results in grain yield and yield components in sorghum...|$|R

5|$|For a few centuries, Europeans had {{experimented with}} American vines <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> in their soil, and many {{varieties}} were imported from America without regulation, disregarding {{the possibility of}} pest transfer, and related problems. Jules-Emile Planchon, a French biologist, who identified the Phylloxera in the 1860s, maintained that this transfer of American vines <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> into Europe greatly increased between roughly 1858 and 1862, {{and this is how}} the Phylloxera was accidentally introduced to Europe around 1860, although the aphid did not enter France until around 1863. It is believed that the advent of steamships was a factor as well, as the ships were faster, and the Phylloxera were able to survive the quicker ocean voyage.|$|E

5|$|The fossils {{found in}} {{abundance}} along this coastline {{provide evidence of}} how animals <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> evolved in this region.

The fossilised remains of the animals <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> that lived in those periods are very well preserved, providing a wealth of information on their body shapes, the way they died and even the fossilised remains of their last meals. Fossil groups found here include crustaceans, insects, molluscs, echinoderms, fish, amphibians, reptiles and a few mammals. At Lulworth Cove there is a fossil forest of conifers, tree-ferns and cycads.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} {{that there are many}} differences between animal <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> microRNAs (miRNAs), <b>and</b> that numerical features based on sequence and structure can be used to predict the function of individual miRNAs. However, there is little research regarding numerical differences between animal <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> miRNAs, <b>and</b> whether a single numerical feature or combination of features could be used to distinguish animal <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> miRNAs or not. Therefore, in current study we aimed to discover numerical features {{that could be used to}} accomplish this. We performed a large-scale analysis of 132 miRNA numerical features, and identified 17 highly significant distinguishing features. However, none of the features independently could clearly differentiate animal <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> miRNAs. By further analysis, we found a four-feature subset that included helix number, stack number, length of pre-miRNA, and minimum free energy, and developed a logistic classifier that could distinguish animal <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> miRNAs effectively. The precision of the classifier was greater than 80 %. Using this tool, we confirmed that there were universal differences between animal <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> miRNAs, <b>and</b> that a single feature was unable to adequately distinguish the difference. This feature set and classifier represent a valuable tool for identifying differences between animal <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> miRNAs at a molecular level...|$|R
