40|$|The {{bioactive}} phospholipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and its receptors LPA 1 - 3 are aberrantly {{expressed in}} {{many types of}} human cancer. LPA {{has been reported to}} induce tumor cell proliferation, migration, and cytokine production. However, whether LPA exerts an effect on lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) or on lymphangiogenesis, a process of new lymphatic vessel formation that is associated with increased metastasis and poor prognosis in cancer patients, has been unknown. Here, we show that LPA induces cell proliferation, survival, migration, and tube formation, and promotes lymphangiogenesis in vitro in human dermal LECs. In addition, LPA induces IL- 8 expression by enhancing IL- 8 promoter activity via activation of the NF-κB pathway in LECs. Using IL- 8 siRNA and IL- 8 neutralizing antibody, we revealed that IL- 8 {{plays an important role in}} LPA-induced lymphangiogenesis in vitro. Moreover, using siRNA inhibition, we discovered that LPA-induced lymphangiogenesis in vitro and IL- 8 production are mediated via the LPA 2 receptor in LECs. Finally, using human sentinel <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessel</b> explants, we demonstrated that LPA up-regulates IL- 8 production in the LECs of lymphatic endothelia. These studies provide the first evidence that LPA promotes lymphangiogenesis and induces IL- 8 production in LECs; we also reveal a possible new role of LPA in the promotion of tumor progression, as well as metastasis, in different cancer types...|$|E
40|$|The {{output of}} {{recirculating}} lymphocytes from cannulated popliteal lymph nodes in sheep was measured after administration of human recombinant interferon (rIFN) -alpha- 2 a. Interferon (IFN) injection caused a dramatic decrease in lymphocyte output from lymph nodes. Following a single s. c. or i. d. injection of 2 x 10 (7) U IFN into the drainage {{area of the}} popliteal lymph node, lymphocyte output fell to below 1 % of the pre-treatment level and remained depressed for up to 35 hr. A substantial decrease in lymphocyte output from cannulated nodes also occurred after IFN was injected either i. v., into {{the skin of the}} opposite non-cannulated hind leg or into an <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessel</b> leading to the popliteal lymph node. After the period of depressed lymphocyte output, a seemingly compensatory surge of cell traffic occurred that lasted 2 - 3 days. During this phase there was a relative increase in the proportion of CD 4 + T cells in lymph. Similar changes occurred after each treatment in animals given multiple doses of IFN. These effects are unlikely to be antigen-induced since there was no blast cell response in any treated animal. The analysis of blood and lymph plasma samples showed that the most severe depression of lymphocyte output was associated with high levels of IFN, while there was no apparent correlation between the reduction in lymphocyte traffic and concentrations of cortisol in plasma. These results suggest that IFN-alpha- 2 a is involved directly in the regulation of lymphocyte output from lymph nodes...|$|E
40|$|Tissue-selective {{lymphocyte}} homing {{is directed}} {{in part by}} specialized vessels that define sites of lymphocyte exit from the blood. These vessels, the post capillary high endothelial venules (HEV), are found in organized lymphoid tissues, and at sites of chronic inflammation. Lymphocytes bearing specific receptors, called homing receptors, recognize and adhere to their putative ligands on high endothelial cells, the vascular addressins. After adhesion, lymphocytes enter organized lymphoid tissues by migrating through the endothelial cell wall. Cells and/or soluble factors arriving in lymph nodes {{by way of the}} afferent lymph supply have been implicated in the maintenance of HEV morphology and efficient lymphocyte homing. In the study reported here, we assessed the influence of <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessel</b> interruption on lymph node composition, organization of cellular elements; and on expression of vascular addressins. At 1 wk after occlusion of afferent lymphatic vessels, HEV became flat walled and expression of the peripheral lymph node addressin disappeared from the luminal aspect of most vessels, while being retained on the abluminal side. In addition, an HEV-specific differentiation marker, defined by mAb MECA- 325, was undetectable at 7 -d postocclusion. In vivo homing studies revealed that these modified vessels support minimal lymphocyte traffic from the blood. After occlusion, we observed dramatic changes in lymphocyte populations and at 7 -d postsurgery, lymph nodes were populated predominantly by cells lacking the peripheral lymph node homing receptor LECAM- 1. In addition, effects on nonlymphoid cells were observed: subcapsular sinus macrophages, defined by mAb MOMA- 1, disappeared; and interdigitating dendritic cells, defined by mAb NLDC- 145, were dramatically reduced. These data reveal that functioning afferent lymphatics are centrally involved in maintaining normal lymph node homeostasis...|$|E

40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (TB), {{caused by}} Mycobacterium bovis, is increasing in incidence in the United Kingdom and detailed knowledge of host-pathogen interactions {{in the natural}} host is essential to facilitate disease control. Vaccination of neonatal calves with Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) induces a significant level of protection from infection with M. bovis. Since neonatal vaccination of humans with BCG induces activation of natural killer (NK) cells, and neonatal calves have high circulating numbers of these cells, it is proposed that NK cells are important in the response to BCG. Furthermore, NK cells {{play an important role}} in shaping adaptive immune responses through interactions with dendritic cells (DCs). The overall hypothesis of this project was that the enhanced efficacy of BCG in neonates is due to the increased number of NK cells, which through interactions with DCs can polarise Th 1 -type CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses, both of which are involved in protection against M. bovis infection. Initially, the frequency and phenotype of NK cells across the blood, afferent lymph and the lymph nodes in steady-state conditions were compared. CD 2 - NK cells were the principal subset of NK cells migrating from the skin to the draining lymph node and were highly activated in afferent lymph and lymph nodes, compared with peripheral blood. It was also demonstrated that CD 2 - NK cells were the main subset of NK cells egressing from the lymph node via the efferent lymphatic vessel to return to circulation. Since many vaccines including BCG are delivered subcutaneously, NK cell responses in the blood and the skin draining <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessel,</b> lymph nodes and efferent lymphatic vessel were determined after BCG vaccination. Alterations in the frequency and receptor repertoire were evident following vaccination, supporting a role for NK cells during BCG vaccination of neonatal calves. To investigate the interactions of NK cells and BCG-infected DCs, in vitro co-cultures were established. CD 2 - NK cells were preferentially activated following culture with BCG-infected DCs and secreted high levels of IFN-γ. Overall, this thesis provides novel evidence that NK cells may re-circulate in steady-state conditions, play a role in BCG vaccination of neonatal calves, and that through interactions with BCG-infected DCs, may be involved in driving protective Th 1 -type adaptive immune responses...|$|E

40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) {{are crucial}} {{participants}} in maintaining immune surveillance of the periphery and initiating primary immune responses within the draining lymph nodes. The <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> provide {{a conduit for}} this essential trafficking and, as this review will describe, {{play an active role}} in regulating DC migration. <b>Afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> capillaries support constitutive trafficking of DCs from resting, non-inflamed tissue, to maintain tolerance against self-antigen and to provide immune surveillance. Following exposure to pathogens or pro-inflammatory cytokines, DCs mature from phagocytes to professional antigen-presenting cells, whilst the lymphatic endothelium adopts an activated phenotype to support the ensuing increase in leukocyte trafficking. The lymphatic endothelial-derived chemokine CCL 21 plays a well-characterized role in directing migration of CCR 7 + DC in both resting and acute inflammatory conditions. However, efficient trafficking of DCs from inflamed tissue also demands additional chemokine-receptor pairs. Thus, entry of DCs to activated <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> is an intricately regulated multi-step process involving numerous chemokines and adhesion molecules. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R
40|$|The {{architecture}} of the mouse popliteal lymph nodes differs from that shown in conventional diagrams. The cortical lymphoid tissue, rather than forming a continuous outer layer, is organised into one or two hemispherical aggregates which project towards the hilus. These aggregates are surrounded by medullary tissue which thus extends to {{large areas of the}} surface of the node. The vascular distribution in the lymphoid aggregates is relatively sparse and contrasts with the dense meshwork of capillaries and venules around them. It also contrasts with the high vascularity of medullary tissue. Arterial vessels, especially those of larger calibre, are predominantly seen in the hilar area of the node suggesting that there is extensive branching as the artery enters the node. Capillaries associated with the lymphoid aggregates are usually lined by continuous endothelium, while those in the medulla are generally of the fenestrated type. The microcirculation has an extensive venous capacity and many venous segments are high endothelium venules whose walls are permeated by lymphocytes. Each node receives one or two <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> and is drained by up to four or five efferent <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels.</b> In approximately half the nodes examined, there were extranodal communications between <b>afferent</b> and efferent <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> allowing some lymph to bypass the node...|$|R
40|$|Based {{on their}} ability to induce {{leukocyte}} chemotaxis and adhesion to endothelial cells (ECs), chemokines have been implicated in driving inflammatory leukocyte emigration. Recently, it was suggested that chemokines can accomplish their pro-emigratory role more effectively while being bound to the luminal surface of the ECs. Previously, such binding was demonstrated in situ in human skin for the prototype alpha-chemokine interleukin (IL) - 8. Here we used an in situ binding assay to investigate the binding characteristics of several beta-chemokines in intact human skin. RANTES, MCP- 1, and MCP- 3 bound, similar to IL- 8, in a specific saturable manner to the ECs of venules and small veins but not arteries or capillaries. RANTES inhibited MCP- 1 and MCP- 3 binding and vice versa, indicating that the EC binding sites are shared among these beta-chemokines; moreover, IL- 8 and RANTES cross-competed for each other's binding, suggesting that the same chemokine binding sites are used by members of alpha- and beta-chemokine subfamilies. Conversely, MIP- 1 alpha did not bind to the ECs and did not compete for binding of RANTES. Analogous to IL- 8, all of the tested beta-chemokines bound to the resident dermal cells. As a novel aspect of chemokine interaction with cells in normal skin, we observed specific, saturable binding of RANTES, MCP- 1, and MCP- 3 but not MIP- 1 alpha or IL- 8 to the ECs of dermal <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels.</b> RANTES, MCP- 1, and MCP- 3 also cross-competed for each other's binding to lymphatics, suggesting a common binding site with a novel chemokine binding profile.

40|$|The {{results may}} be {{summarized}} as follows : 1. The lymphonodi found in the abdominal and pelvic cavities are divided into two main groups, visceral and parietal. The visceral group is subdivided into 12 groups : Lnn. gastrici sinistri, Lnn. gastrici dextri, Lnn. subpylorici, Lnn. lienales, Lnn. gastrolienales, Lnn. hepatogastrici, Lnn. mesenterici communes, Lnn. intestinales, Lnn. caecales, Lnn. mesocolici dextri, Lnn. mesocolici medii and Lnn. mesocolici sinistri; the parietal group into 6 groups; Lnn. lumbales craniales, Lnn. lumbales caudales, Lnn. ilici externi, Lnn. ilici interni, Lnn. sacrales laterales and Lnn. subinguinales profundi. Out of the above-mentioned 18 groups, about Lnn. intestinales, Lnn. sacrales laterales and Lnn. subinguinales profundi of the cat there is no description in the reports of many previous investigators. 2. With regard to the numbers of lymphonodi of each group found in this observation, the writers noted some remarkable individual differences, but not sexual differences. Variations in number of lymphonodi of the visceral and parietal groups were more conspicuous than variations in superficial areas of the body. 3. Each group of lymphonodi also was categorized into one of 3 groups of constant, nearly constant and inconstant by their ratio of existence in the cat body. 4. The origin of <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> which entered into each group of lymphonodi was investigated respectively.

40|$|SummaryTo induce {{adaptive}} immunity, dendritic cells (DCs) migrate through <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> (LVs) to draining {{lymph nodes}} (dLNs). This process occurs in several consecutive steps. Upon entry into lymphatic capillaries, DCs first actively crawl into downstream collecting vessels. From there, they are next passively and rapidly {{transported to the}} dLN by lymph flow. Here, we describe a role for the chemokine CCL 21 in intralymphatic DC crawling. Performing time-lapse imaging in murine skin, we found that blockade of CCL 21 —but not the absence of lymph flow—completely abolished DC migration from capillaries toward collecting vessels and reduced the ability of intralymphatic DCs to emigrate from skin. Moreover, we found that in vitro low laminar flow established a CCL 21 gradient along lymphatic endothelial monolayers, thereby inducing downstream-directed DC migration. These findings reveal a role for intralymphatic CCL 21 in promoting DC trafficking to dLNs, through {{the formation of a}} flow-induced gradient...|$|R
40|$|The lymphoid {{compartment}} of {{lymph nodes}} is impermeable to many molecules that are delivered via <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels.</b> In the lymphoid compartment, fibroblast reticular cells form an interconnected network—the conduit system. This network has a structural function supporting tightly packed lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells; however, {{it also has}} an important function as a molecular sieve, since it contains tubules that are the only entry point for fluid and allow only small molecules and particles (including antigens) to flow along the network. This size exclusion may prevent pathogens entering the blood from lymph. Dendritic cells can sample antigens from the conduit system and present them to nearby lymphocytes; this may be particularly important in initiating immune responses. The importance of larger antigen transport via macrophages or other cells is unclear. Lymphocytes and antigen-presenting dendritic cells actively move and interact along the conduit system, perhaps in response to chemokines or cytokines transported by the conduit system; these molecules may also be transported to high endothelial venules and regulate the attraction of blood leukocytes to the lymph nodes. The conduit system is also important for fluid distribution between <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatics</b> and blood, but the mechanisms are not yet established...|$|R

Since splice variants of CD 44 promote metastasis of certain tumors to lymph nodes, we explored the expression of CD 44 proteins on migrating LC and DC. We show that upon antigen contact, LC and DC upregulate pan CD 44 epitopes and epitopes encoded by variant exons v 4, v 5, v 6, and v 9. Antibodies against CD 44 epitopes inhibit the emigration of LC from the epidermis, prevent binding of activated LC and DC to the T cell zones of lymph nodes, and severely inhibit their capacity to induce a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction to a skin hapten in vivo. Our results demonstrate that CD 44 splice variant expression is obligatory for the migration and function of LC and DC...|$|R
50|$|In {{order for}} an {{adaptive}} immune response to occur T cells need to be activated. T cells become activated by recognising foreign antigens bound to antigen presenting cells (APC), in particular, dendritic cells. In order for naïve T cells to bind to their specific antigen, they need to experience physical contact with those cells. Since antigen levels are usually low, contact in blood circulation would be unlikely. Therefore, T cells need a region where {{they can go to}} sample foreign antigens that have entered the body. When an APC, such as a dendritic cell, binds a foreign antigen it becomes activated and moves into the lymph nodes (sites for antigen sampling by T cells) via <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels.</b> Naïve T cells in the circulation regularly move through the lymph nodes via HEV in order to scan the APC for foreign antigens.

50|$|Lymph {{enters the}} convex {{side of the}} lymph node through {{multiple}} <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels,</b> and flows through spaces called sinuses.

All of these sinuses drain the filtered lymphatic fluid into the medullary sinuses, from where the lymph flows into the efferent lymph vessels to exit the node at the hilum on the concave side. These vessels are smaller and don't allow the passage of the macrophages so that they remain contained to function within the lymph node. In the course of the lymph, lymphocytes may be activated as part of the adaptive immune response.|$|R

In a model of transendothelial trafficking, some monocytes become DCs in response to endogenous signals. These DCs migrate across endothelium in the ablumenal-to-lumenal direction (reverse transmigration), reminiscent of the migration into <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels.</b> Here we show that the subpopulation of monocytes that expresses CD 16 (Fc � receptor III) is predisposed to become migratory DCs. The vast majority of cells derived from CD 16 � monocytes reverse transmigrated, and their presence was associated with migratory cells expressing high levels of CD 86 and human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) -DR, and robust capacity to induce allogeneic T cell proliferation. A minority of CD 16 � monocytes reverse transmigrated, and these cells stimulated T cell proliferation less efficiently. CD 16 was not functionally required for reverse transmigration, but promoted cell survival when yeast particles (zymosan) were present as a maturation stimulus in the subendothelial matrix. The cell surface phenotype and migratory characteristics of CD 16 � monocytes were inducible in CD 16 � monocytes by preincubation with TGF� 1.

30|$|In SLNB, {{numerous}} {{methods for}} the injection of a radioisotope (RI) and/or blue dye have been reported, including peritumoral, intratumoral, subcutaneous, intradermal, and subareolar injections (Schwartz et al., 2002). However, these methods present certain disadvantages and potential pitfalls regarding SLN mapping. On the other hand, several {{studies on the}} application of indirect lymphography to obtain images of the <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> and nodes were reported in the 1980 s. Among them, Suga et al. identified SLN by three-dimensional multidetector-row computed tomographic lymphography (3 D MDCT-LG) using a nonionic contrast medium (Suga et al., 2003). This technique may compensate for the disadvantages of the scintigraphic and blue dye-staining methods because clear visualization of the direct connection between the SLN and its <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> can be obtained on detailed cross-sectional anatomical images. Despite several papers to date having been published on computed tomographic lymphography (CTLG) in women, {{there have been no}} reported studies on men. Male breast cancer is a rare disease, accounting for < 1 % of all breast cancers and < 1 % of all annual cancer deaths in men (Fentiman et al., 2006). Because of the low number of affected patients, treatment for breast cancer in men has been extrapolated from treatment protocols for breast cancer in women (Gentilini et al., 2007). Since the incision for SLNB is necessarily separate from the primary surgery in men, a navigation system which can easily detect the incision site in the axillary region is required.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the feasibility of lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel node identification in testicular cancer. Five patients with clinical stage I testicular cancer were prospectively included. A single dose of technetium- 99 m nanocolloid (mean dose 99 MBq, volume 0. 2 ml) was injected into the funiculus in the first patient and into the testicular parenchyma in the following four patients. Dynamic lymphoscintigraphy was performed over 10 min, followed by early and late static images after 15 min and 2 to 24 h, respectively. Lymphoscintigraphy was followed by laparoscopic sentinel node biopsy on the same day in the last two patients using patent blue dye and an endoscopic gamma probe. The funicular administration route showed five hot spots in the right inguinal region after 2 h. Intratesticular administration resulted in sentinel node visualisation in three of the four patients. Dynamic images showed <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> to one sentinel node in the left para-aortic region in two patients and two sentinel nodes in the left para-aortic region in another patient. Sentinel nodes were intraoperatively identified in one of two patients who underwent laparoscopic exploration. It is concluded that lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel node identification is feasible in stage I testicular cancer using intratesticular radiocolloid administratio...|$|R
40|$|Structural and {{functional}} organization of immunity are studied usually {{on the level}} of cells and intercellular interactions. But it cannot be to reduce only to cells of immune system. Circulatory system keeps a particular place in this process. On its vessels and tissue channels antigens, lymphoid cells, macrophages, and antibodies circulate in the organism. Circulatory system plays to keep a role in the organization of immune–protective system, which is compound, multilevel functional system, including connective and border tissues, mobilizes factors of nonspecific and specific immune protection of the inner environment of the organism. The specific part of immune–protective system is presented by lymphoid structures. As a subsystem of hemopoiesis and connective tissue, they connect up whole immune–protective system over the circulatory system. Lymphoid–lymphatic apparatus is anatomical bases of immune–protective system. Lymphatic and blood systems take part in its organization, because lymphoid formations often use <b>vessels,</b> <b>lymphatic</b> and blood, as paths of delivery of antigens and ducts for own “secretums”. Lymphoid formations connect with blood vessels constantly but do not all of them have <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels.</b> Peripheral lymphoid formations are on the paths tissue fluid and lymph flow out in lymphatic and venous buds. In this plane, the lymphatic system is complex of lymphatic bud (drainage of organs — lymph flow out them, including antigens) and lymphoid formations (multi–staged cleaning of lymph in process of lymph flow out organs in veins) ...|$|R
40|$|Lymph {{from the}} mammary gland passes {{through at least}} three lymph nodes. These are usually the mammary, iliofemoral and medial iliac, {{although}} the subiliac, internal inguinal and sacral lymph nodes may also be involved. The iliofemoral, a large, flattened node in the dorsolateral wall of the pelvis, receives lymph from subiliac and popliteal as well as mammary nodes. <b>Afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> either enter the subcapsular sinus on the dorsal surface of this node, or penetrate more deeply into the node. Lymphatics carrying mammary lymph enter more caudally than those from the popliteal or subiliac lymph nodes. Evans blue dye, injected into the mammary gland, showed a characteristic distribution within the mammary and iliofemoral nodes. Within the iliofemoral nodes it was present mainly in the caudal part. However, when China ink was used, carbon particles were distributed {{throughout most of the}} ipsilateral mammary nodes. In the iliofemoral node the carbon was distributed more widely than the Evans blue; it was found, mostly within macrophages, over the whole length of the node. A similar distribution of carbon was seen when it entered from the popliteal node. It appears likely that, although lymph from the mammary gland shows some preference for the caudal part of the iliofemoral node, constituents of this lymph may mix within the node with lymph from other primary nodes...|$|R
40|$|The {{sentinel}} node is {{the first}} lymph node that drains a primary tumour. If this lymphatic drainage occurs in a step-wise fashion, this lymph node reflects the pathological status of the remaining lymph node basin. The day before the operation, a total dose of 60 MBq 99 mTc nanocolloid is injected around the primary tumour for lymphoscintigraphy. On the day of surgery, 1 ml of blue dye is injected around the primary tumour to facilitate sentinel lymph node detection. After making a small incision over the regional lymph node region, the sentinel node can be detected using a hand-held gamma ray detection probe; the sentinel lymph node and the <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> will be stained blue. Sentinel node biopsy has proved useful for malignant melanoma, breast cancer, penile cancer, vulvar cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma and thyroid cancer. New studies are described on breast cancer and malignant melanoma. Gamma-probe-guided localization of radiolabelled lymph nodes can direct the surgeon non-invasively to {{the exact location of}} the sentinel node. Once localized with a gamma probe, it is quick and easy to remove the sentinel node through a small incision. Discriminating the node from other tissue can be aided by blue dye which stains the lymph node. It appears that both radioactivity and blue dye are complementary for locating the sentinel node.

40|$|Lymphoscintigraphy (LS) is the {{injection}} of radioactive particles that are then imaged {{as they pass}} through <b>afferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> to their respective lymph node drainage basins. Concerning sentinel node (SN) procedures, LS following the SN concept, is originated to identify the first lymph node to receive drainage from a primary tumor as defined by Morton and colleagues. However, this definition is open to misinterpretation especially if {{there is more than}} one SN. We prefer the definition of Uren et al. who defined SN as "any lymph node receiving direct lymphatic drainage from a lesion site". This later definition includes all possible scenarios including multiple SN and interval nodes. SN biopsy has been described as the most significant revolution in surgical oncology of the last decade. Contrary to views held in the past, the SN approach has demonstrated that lymphatic spread of cancer is not only orderly, but also predictable. In patients with melanoma and breast cancer it has been proved that the histological status of the SN is predictive of the status of the lymph node basin. Thus, SN evaluation distinguishes patients without nodal metastases, who can avoid nodal basin dissection and its associated risk of lymphedema, from those with metastatic involvement, who might benefit from additional therapy such as complete lymphadenectomy and adjuvant therapy. Patients with negative results from SN biopsy may also benefit psychologically. The possible therapeutic benefit of the SN procedure itself is currently under investigation in several prospective clinical trials...|$|R
