5|$|In pharmacology, {{ionization}} of {{a compound}} alters its physical behaviour and macro properties such as solubility and lipophilicity, logp). For example, ionization of any compound {{will increase the}} solubility in water, but decrease the lipophilicity. This is exploited in drug development to increase the concentration of a compound in the blood by <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> pKa of an ionizable group.|$|E
5|$|The highest notes {{can have}} a shrill, {{piercing}} quality and {{can be difficult to}} tune accurately. Different instruments often play differently in this respect due to the sensitivity of the bore and reed measurements. Using alternate fingerings and <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> embouchure help correct the pitch of these notes.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Flower {{was created by}} Vincent Diamante, a video game music {{composer}} and professor at the University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division. He had previously scored the music for Cloud, Chen's first game, and Dyadin {{when they were both}} at the University of Southern California. He worked directly with the development team to integrate the music into the game by <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> placements of flowers and the tones that each type played when they were reached. He did this by harmonizing the gameplay with the music, and <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> music dynamically to correspond to changes in the game world. Diamante used his music to influence the development team in adapting ideas he had for the game.|$|E
30|$|Sensitivity {{refers to}} the number of times that the system could {{automatically}} <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> application volume on out of the number of times <b>the</b> user manually <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> application volume on (i.e., how much the system could estimate the application volume on). Specificity {{refers to the}} number of times that the system could automatically <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> application volume off out of the number of times that <b>the</b> user manually <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> application volume off (i.e., how much the system could estimate the application volume off). Positive Predictive Value (PPV) refers {{to the number of}} times that the user wanted to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> application volume on out of the number of times that <b>the</b> system automatically <b>adjusted</b> application volume off (i.e., the rate of correct estimation of application volume on versus <b>adjusted</b> by <b>the</b> system). Negative Predictive Value (NPV) refers to the number of times that the user wanted to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> application volume off out of the number of times that <b>the</b> system automatically <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> application volume off (i.e., the rate of correct estimation the application volume off versus <b>adjusted</b> by <b>the</b> system). Accuracy refers to the rate of correct estimation of all. The higher the sensitivity, the fewer times the user needs to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> application volume on. The higher the specificity, the fewer times the user needs to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> application volume off.|$|R

The hundred rider should be initially adjusted and follow by <b>the</b> tens rider. <b>Adjust</b> <b>the</b> ones rider until the scale pointer is at zero again.|$|R
5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|After {{boosting}} the trim power by 50 percent, <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> aerodynamics, and other modifications, two further mated test flights {{were carried out}} before Schoch {{was able to make}} a successful release and hookup on 14 October 1948. During the fifth free flight on 22 October 1948, Schoch again found it difficult to hook the Goblin to the bomber's trapeze, aborting four attempts before hitting the trapeze bar and breaking the hook on the XF-85's nose. Again, a forced landing was successfully carried out at Muroc.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{animation}} required for Deadpool's mask and Colossus, Reese and Wernick had more freedom than usual to keep <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> script during post-production. Reynolds recorded new lines of dialogue using his iPhone, and then re-recorded {{the lines in}} an additional dialogue recording session once the film was finalized. Lines added after filming included Reynolds doing an impression of Wolverine star Hugh Jackman's natural Australian accent, and another where Deadpool asks whether the character Professor X is being portrayed by James McAvoy or Patrick Stewart {{at that point in}} the X-Men timeline, which became a favorite line in the film for many audience members.|$|E
50|$|Waulis design {{describes}} a crank device and an adjusting device of a combustion engine. <b>The</b> system <b>adjusts</b> <b>the</b> cylinder {{pressure of the}} motor {{in accordance with the}} required power. Adjustment of the cylinder pressure is achieved by changing the compression ratio by means of <b>the</b> <b>adjusting</b> device. <b>The</b> <b>adjusting</b> device moves an eccentric wheel to a set position using an adjusting wheel; this results in the connecting rod moving the piston to a desired distance from the cylinder head. <b>The</b> <b>adjusting</b> device measures <b>the</b> volume of the air entering <b>the</b> cylinder and <b>adjusts</b> <b>the</b> compression ratio appropriately. <b>The</b> <b>adjusting</b> device also takes into account the speed of rotation to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> compression pressure accordingly.|$|R

50|$|Prior to autoclaving, some labs <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> pH of LB to 7.5 or 8 with sodium {{hydroxide}}. However {{sodium hydroxide}} {{does not provide}} any buffering capacity to the media, and this results in rapid changes to the pH during bacteria cultivation.To get around this some labs prefer to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> pH with 5-10 mmol/L TRIS buffer, diluted from 1 mol/l TRIS stock at the desired pH. However, it is not absolutely necessary to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> pH for most situations. Some labs <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> pH to 7.0 merely as a precaution.|$|R
5|$|By {{gathering}} clues and {{manipulating the}} environment, the player solves thematically linked puzzles. For example, the book leading to Voltaic is accessed by aligning beams of light across a canyon; the Age itself contains similar energy-based puzzles. Edanna's plant-filled puzzles require {{manipulation of the}} Age's ecosystem. Puzzles often involve observing interactions between elements of the environment, then <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> links between them. The player can also pick up and view journals or pages written by game characters which reveal back-story and give hints to solving puzzles. Cursor Mode allows the player to select items from a personal inventory {{at the bottom of}} the screen.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to single-player, the title features cooperative multiplayer, where players can accept invitation from {{up to six}} other players to join their game session through either LAN or online connection. Alongside being able to fight enemies together, players can swap messages and exchange loot. There is also a Level Editor available, where players can access developer tools and create their own levels which can be shared with other players. The editor features {{a large amount of}} options for environment customization, including <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> shade of environmental elements like roads.|$|E
5|$|In match race mode, {{the player}} competes {{in a series}} of races against AI-controlled snowboarders. The game times the player {{throughout}} the level and players receive a damage meter which fills if the snowboarder falls down or is knocked over. The difficulty level in match races can be set to easy, medium, or hard, <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> complexity and number of races. If the player fails at defeating an AI competitor, they must retire. The player is given three chances to beat the computer before the game is over.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{beginning}} the Iron Cobra {{was known for}} adjustability. Through all the generations, the pedal has had <b>the</b> ability to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> footboard angle independently of the beater shaft angle, <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> beater head angle, <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> hoop clamp size, <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> beater shaft length, <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> feel of the beater with a sliding weight, and <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> spring tension. Not all of these adjustments are universally possible on all other pedals from other manufacturers. The cam shape is not adjustable on the Iron Cobra, except on the third gen. duo-glide model, but the pedal has historically been offered with two different optional cams. The rolling-glide cam is round for a smooth action, while the powerglide cam changes radius mid-stroke for more acceleration. While most of the Iron Cobra pedals are double chain drive, the flexi-glide version has a kevlar strap drive. Since at least the second generation, the pedals have come with a hard plastic carrying case.|$|R

5|$|Interferometry {{is another}} method {{to find the}} {{wavelength}} of electromagnetic radiation for determining the speed of light. A coherent beam of light (e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equationc=λf.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{characters}} from other games were meant {{to have some of}} their moves changed or removed in order to balance them with KOF's new characters. However, designers focused in <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> imbalance of certain characters without removing any move. In the end, creators of the series noted that the Art of Fighting characters were the strongest ones in the game. Nevertheless, other characters such as Terry and Andy Bogard became the ones who got the designers' utmost attention and were given new moves.|$|E
5|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} is {{an excellent}} method for structure determination, {{although it has been}} difficult to obtain intense, monochromatic beams of neutrons in sufficient quantities. Traditionally, nuclear reactors have been used, although sources producing neutrons by spallation are becoming increasingly available. Being uncharged, neutrons scatter much more readily from the atomic nuclei rather than from the electrons. Therefore, neutron scattering is very useful for observing the positions of light atoms with few electrons, especially hydrogen, which is essentially invisible in the X-ray diffraction. Neutron scattering also has the remarkable property that the solvent can be made invisible by <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> ratio of normal water, H2O, and heavy water, D2O.|$|E
30|$|Although the new {{regulation}} in 2004 mandates {{the local government}} to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> minimum wages {{at least once in}} every 2  years, most of <b>the</b> provinces <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> minimum wages once a year.|$|R

5|$|Norton Internet Security 2000, {{released}} January 10, 2000, was Symantec's {{first foray}} beyond virus protection and content control filters. Its release followed an alliance between Internet provider Excite@Home and antivirus vendor McAfee.com to provide Internet subscribers with McAfee's new firewall software, McAfee Personal Firewall. Version 2000s firewall, based on AtGuard from WRQ, filters traffic at the packet level. It can block ActiveX controls and Java applets. Other functionalities include cookie removal, and banner ad blocking. ZDNet found the ad blocker removed graphics {{that were not}} ads, breaking pages. <b>Adjusting</b> <b>the</b> settings fixed the problem, however the process was complicated. ZDNet noted {{the lack of information}} presented concerning attacks the firewall blocked. Norton LiveUpdate downloads and installs program updates.|$|E
5|$|Space Travel is {{an early}} video game {{developed}} by Ken Thompson in 1969 that simulates travel in the solar system. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model {{of the solar system}} with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, and adjust the overall speed by <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational pull of the astronomical bodies.|$|E
5|$|Success {{followed}} in 2002 when the Galaxy won the Supporters' Shield {{for having the}} best regular season record in the league. Schmid was lauded for his defensive tactics after <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> team's standard formation to a 3–5–2 early in the season. The shift allowed Alexi Lalas to play as a sweeper without specific marking responsibilities in the three-man defensive line. Schmid also brought Guatemalan forward Carlos Ruiz to the team; Ruiz won league Most Valuable Player(MVP) award that year. Amidst criticism for failing to win in previous years, the franchise won its first MLS Cup with a 1–0 overtime victory against New England. The team again reached the Open Cup final but lost to the Columbus Crew.|$|E
30|$|We use the {{well-established}} backpropagation algorithm to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> network weights.

50|$|A drum key or drum tuning key {{is a tool}} used to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> tension rods of a Drum. It is {{also used}} to adjust Drum hardware. It is used to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> pitch of a drum.|$|R
50|$|The feature allows <b>the</b> {{player to}} <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> {{intonation}} of the guitar throughout its life. Loosening the fasteners {{on the bridge}} allows it slide {{back and forth to}} <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> intonation when needed unlike standard guitars with glued bridges.|$|R
5|$|The {{character}} of Tess was {{originally intended to}} be featured as the main antagonist of The Last of Us, pursuing Joel for a year before a final confrontation in which she is killed by Ellie. However, the team {{found it difficult to}} believe that Tess would dispute with Joel and pursue him for a year; this was solved by significantly <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> story. Actress Annie Wersching was impressed by the script, and Druckmann's ability to write unique female characters. When writing the game's female characters, particularly Tess and Ellie, Druckmann avoided external influences, such as the media's portrayal of women, as he wished to write his own story.|$|E
5|$|The end-fire array trades a few {{decibels}} {{of output}} power for directionality, so it requires more enclosures {{for the same}} output power as a tight-packed, flat-fronted array of enclosures. Sixteen enclosures in four rows were used in 2007 {{at one of the}} stages of the Ultra Music Festival, to reduce low frequency interference to neighboring stages. Because of the physical size of the end-fire array, few concert venues are able to implement it. The output pattern suffers from comb-filtering off-axis, but can be further shaped by <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> frequency response of each row of subwoofers.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} first {{proposed}} in 2001, during the original {{run of the}} Bionicle toyline. Lego contacted multiple writers for the project, including original Bionicle contributors Bob Thompson and Alastair Swinnerton, and Hollywood writers Henry Gilroy and Greg Weisman. Production began in 2002, taking approximately a year to complete. A {{major part of the}} graphical design was <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> characters so they could work in human-like ways while still resembling the original toys. The music was composed by Nathan Furst, who used orchestral and tribal elements to create the score. Voice casting was handled by Kris Zimmerman, and the voicework was done with the setting and mythos of Bionicle in mind.|$|E
