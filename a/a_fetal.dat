5|$|In 1981, Jean Cadenat and Jacques Blache {{revisited}} {{the type}} specimens of S. tudes {{and found that}} the lectotype from Nice is likely not a smalleye hammerhead, but rather <b>a</b> <b>fetal</b> whitefin hammerhead (S. couardi, likely a synonym of the scalloped hammerhead, S. lewini). This would also explain the anomalous locality of the Nice specimen, as the smalleye hammerhead is not otherwise known outside of the Americas. By the rules of binomial nomenclature, Sphyra tudes should then become the valid name for the whitefin hammerhead, taking precedence over S. couardi, and the smalleye hammerhead would revert to being Sphyrna bigelowi. Taxonomists, though, have been reluctant to change the names again, preferring to keep the smalleye hammerhead as S. tudes. For this solution to have official status would require a decision by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), to reject the Nice specimen as the lectotype and designate the Cayenne specimen in its place. The relevant petition to the ICZN has not yet been put forth.|$|E

5|$|After {{finding out}} that Arizona cheated on her with Lauren, Callie kicks Arizona out of their apartment. They also let out their true {{feelings}} about the accident and more is revealed about how they actually have felt. Callie initially agrees to couples therapy, but she {{shows up at the}} office only to tell Arizona that she isn't going in. Arizona gets drunk with April for a laugh while Callie, who is at the fundraiser, tells people that Arizona died in the plane crash. Arizona is led to believe that she and Leah slept together, however all they did was dance and make grilled cheese sandwiches after watching Derek perform surgery on film. Arizona pursues a sexual relationship with Leah but cuts ties with her when Callie asks her to come back home. It is revealed that Arizona became pregnant via a sperm donor prior to sleeping with Lauren. They decided to try again for a second child, but after agreeing that Callie would carry it, Callie went to see an OB/GYN and discovered that she had developed adhesions in her uterus since Sofia's birth, meaning she can't carry any more children. When she told Arizona, Arizona offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing that if something goes wrong, they won't make it and she doesn't want to put them in that position. They agree to postpone their plans to have another baby. However, in the season finale of Season 10 it is implied that Callie and Arizona's dream of having other child may come by means of a surrogate. At the beginning of Season 11, Callie and Arizona decide to have a baby by surrogate and Arizona applies for <b>a</b> <b>fetal</b> surgery fellowship with Dr. Herman. Arizona, with a heavy workload because of the fellowship, and Callie have an argument in the waiting room, and they choose to go to therapy together, resulting in a 30-day break. Arizona believes that the break strengthened their relationship and made her realize that she needs Callie - Callie on the other hand declares that the break gave her a taste of the freedom that she has been missing. Callie walks away and the two get a divorce later.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Heather Brooks dies in {{the premier}} of season ten. She goes {{to search for}} Dr. Webber and finds him lying in the {{basement}} of the hospital. Trying to save Dr. Webber, she accidentally steps into a puddle and electrocutes herself while hitting her head as she falls. Bailey moves a cancer patient in Webber's room to force some perspective and make him take the treatment. Also introduced in the tenth season was Dr. Karev's estranged father Jimmy Evans (James Remar) who tries to form a relationship with his son but fails repeatedly and ultimately dies in a botched surgery. The conclusion of season 10 has Cristina leaving Grey Sloan for Dr. Burke's job overseas while Dr. Ross makes a last-minute decision to follow her in order to study under her. Dr. Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary) unknowingly drops a bombshell that she is the adopted love child of Dr. Webber and the late Dr. Grey, which makes for yet another half sister of Dr. Meredith Grey. Also, Dr. Yang leaves her seat on the board to Dr. Karev while Dr. Webber all but promises the seat to Dr. Bailey. Introduced in season eleven is Dr. Nicole Herman (Geena Davis), who is Chief of Fetal Surgery at Grey Sloan Memorial. Dr. Herman mentors Arizona Robbins in <b>a</b> <b>fetal</b> surgery fellowship, and plays in a twelve episode arc before departing after episode fourteen.|$|E

40|$|Bcl 11 a is a {{transcription}} factor known to regulate lymphoid and erythroid development. Recent bioinformatic analysis of global gene expression patterns has suggested {{a role for}} Bcl 11 a {{in the development of}} dendritic cell (DC) lineages. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the development of DC and other lineages in Bcl 11 a (-/-) mice. We found that Bcl 11 a was required for expression of IL- 7 receptor (IL- 7 R) and Flt 3 in early hematopoietic progenitor cells. In addition, we found severely decreased numbers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in Bcl 11 <b>a</b> (-/-) <b>fetal</b> livers and in the bone marrow of Bcl 11 <b>a</b> (-/-) <b>fetal</b> liver chimeras. Moreover, Bcl 11 a (-/-) cells showed severely impaired in vitro development of Flt 3 L-derived pDCs and classical DCs (cDCs). In contrast, we found normal in vitro development of DCs from Bcl 11 <b>a</b> (-/-) <b>fetal</b> liver cells treated with GM-CSF. These results suggest that the persistent cDC development observed in Bcl 11 <b>a</b> (-/-) <b>fetal</b> liver chimeras reflects derivation from a Bcl 11 a- and Flt 3 -independent pathway in vivo...|$|R

25|$|Ornithine transcarbamylase is only {{expressed}} in the liver, thus performing an enzyme assay to confirm the diagnosis requires a liver biopsy.

In cases where prenatal diagnosis was requested, <b>a</b> <b>fetal</b> liver biopsy used to be required to confirm if a fetus was affected.

25|$|Prevention is by {{decreasing}} {{risk factors}} such as chlamydia infections through screening and treatment. While some ectopic pregnancies will resolve without treatment, this approach has not been well studied as of 2014. The use of the medication methotrexate works as well as surgery in some cases. Specifically it works well when the beta-HCG is low {{and the size of}} the ectopic is small. Surgery is still typically recommended if the tube has ruptured, there is <b>a</b> <b>fetal</b> heartbeat, or the person's vital signs are unstable. The surgery may be laparoscopic or through a larger incision, known as a laparotomy. Outcomes are generally good with treatment.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Roe v.

In 1976, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, barring federal funding of abortions (except in cases of rape, incest, or {{a threat to the}} life of the mother) for poor women through the Medicaid program.

25|$|In 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum {{suggested}} that the strange, sexless creature in the foreground of the painting {{was inspired by a}} Peruvian mummy, which Munch could have seen at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. This mummy, which was buried in <b>a</b> <b>fetal</b> position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Munch's friend Paul Gauguin: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin's paintings, among those the central figure in his painting, Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles) and for the old woman at the left in his painting, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?. In 2004, an Italian anthropologist speculated that Munch might have seen a mummy in Florence's Museum of Natural History, which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting. Nonetheless, later studies have confirmed Rosenblum's suggestion, disproving the Italian theory, for Munch had not been to Florence until after painting The Scream.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 17 September 2007, a brand-new gym bag was left {{in front of a}} shop lot in PJS 1/48, Petaling Jaya, {{discovered}} by the shop owner. It contained an unidentified child's naked body which was stuffed in <b>a</b> <b>fetal</b> position; police believed that she had been dead for more than six hours before the discovery. A cucumber and a brinjal was found stuffed inside her genitals and had caused her rectum to rupture. It was determined that bacterial infection had contributed to her death. At the time, Nurin Jazlin's parents were not able to identify the body as their daughter's due to the changes in her physical features; it was even suggested that the child might be a foreigner, as she lacked a scar which would be caused by the mandatory BCG vaccination against tuberculosis. Her parents initially maintained hope that their daughter might be alive and were the victims of several prank calls from people claiming that Nurin was under their care. Later DNA tests conducted confirmed the body as Nurin Jazlin's.|$|E
