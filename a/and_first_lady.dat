5|$|The White House {{stated the}} firings were done because {{financial}} improprieties in the Travel Office operation during previous administrations had been revealed by an FBI investigation. Critics contended the firings were done to allow friends of President Bill Clinton <b>and</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> Hillary Rodham Clinton {{to take over}} the travel business and that the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.

5|$|The {{publicity}} of Ryan White's story catapulted {{him into}} the national spotlight, amidst a growing wave of AIDS coverage in the news media.

Ryan participated in numerous public benefits for children with AIDS. Many celebrities appeared with Ryan, starting during his trial and continuing {{for the rest of}} his life, to help publicly destigmatize socializing with people with AIDS.
