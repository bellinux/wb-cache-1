50|$|Most {{deficiencies}} {{were found}} in field packs, users asked that the inner flaps on the small arms ammunition cases be removed as they impeded the rapid removal of cartridge magazines. Developers replaced these with simple strips of nylon fabric to divide the cartridge magazines. At some point during 1971 the Marine Corps found that the small arms ammunition case with the divider flaps was acceptable and initiated <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedures.</b> On 31 January 1972, the army issued military specification MIL-C-28981(MC) and these small arms ammunition cases were type classified and assigned the Federal Stock Number 8465-464-2084. The Defense Support Agency (DSA) issued contracts for the item for fiscal year 1973.|$|E
5000|$|Eight A-7D {{aircraft}} {{were transferred}} from England AFB, Louisiana in June 1981, which was converting to the A-10 Thunderbolt II. The A-7s {{were given the}} [...] "LV" [...] tailcode (for Las Vegas) and had a dark purple/black paint motif. The aircraft were assigned nominally to the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing and in addition, the group acquired the prototype A-7K two-seat dual control trainer from Edwards AFB (73-1008) that had been converted from its original A-7D configuration in 1978. In doing so, the group became the only active-duty unit to fly the A-7K.

40|$|Recent {{literature}} {{related to}} <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedures</b> for dense-graded mixtures is summarized. Current state {{of practice and}} development of <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedures</b> are reviewed. Many agencies are {{reducing the number of}} process control-related parameters included in their specification (e. g., gradation), moving toward an end-result specification. End-result specifications are suited to Oregon’s needs at present; however, performance-related specifications currently {{do not appear to be}} suited to Oregon needs. Many agencies are increasing the use of mix volumetrics in specifications, in part because the use of Superpave mixes is increasing and these mixes are designed using mix volumetrics. Recommended specifications for Superpave and stone-matrix asphalt mixes are available and have been implemented by some states. Pay factor equations have been formulated that allow separation of the parameter mean and standard deviation, thus encouraging the contractor to hit the job mix formula target and minimize the process variability...|$|E
40|$|The current Australian Rail Industry Safety & Standards Board (RISSB) {{standards}} allow new {{railway vehicle}} designs {{to be assessed}} using validated modelling techniques and recognised multi-body simulation tools (particularly NUCARS, VAMPIRE and GENSYS) in place of physical testing.

40|$|The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) {{makes use}} of 33 medium beta (0. 61) and 48 high beta (0. 81) superconducting cavities. Each cavity is {{equipped}} with a fundamental power coupler, which should withstand the full klystron power of 550 kW in full reflection for the duration of an RF pulse of 1. 3 msec at 60 Hz repetition rate. Before assembly to a superconducting cavity, the vacuum components of the coupler are submitted to <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedures</b> consisting of preliminary quality assessments, cleaning and clean room assembly, vacuum leak checks and baking under vacuum, followed by conditioning and RF high power testing. Similar <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedures</b> (except clean room assembly and baking) were applied for the airside components of the coupler.

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this project is to devise {{improved}} quality <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedures</b> to examine quality characteristics of utility poles at the factory of the supplier (FAT) and on-site upon receipt by the customer (SAT). To that end, the thesis draws upon available standards, literature, and industry practices regarding wood, fiberglass and steel poles. As far as {{the design of the}} research, a single case study of a major power company was chosen. Then, a data collection plan was developed in order to build upon the existing knowledge found in the literature, and upon the data that can be collected from three of the Company’s suppliers, in addition to the Technical Research Institute of Sweden (SP). Documents’ analysis, interviews, observations, and a survey were the tools of that plan. It was found that criteria, inspection and test methods of wood poles are all sufficiently covered in the standards and the literature; for wood is the most commonly used material for utility poles. Next, in coverage of research, are the steel poles; while there is currently no standard that covers fiberglass utility poles. Indeed, quality characteristics, criteria, and <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedures</b> can altogether form parts of a sustainable solution, as long as the quality is managed as a process whether at the Company’s end or at the fabrication sites; that is especially true if there is some form of backward partnership between the Company and its suppliers...|$|E

It involves a characterization of the actual planning and scheduling situation and supports systematic exploration of improvement options and their benefits. Insights gained in two explorative industrial case studies were used {{to arrive at a}} robust method that can be applied in a variety of batch process industries. The method is aimed at supporting industrial decision makers in deciding whether to invest in hardware i. e. production and storage capacity, or software i. e. batch scheduling and sequencing, or to focus on information management i. e. customer order <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedures</b> or planning issues like delivery time policy...|$|E
40|$|Job and {{resource}} structures in batch process industries are generally very complex, which renders {{the assessment of}} what workload can be completed during a specific period very difficult. Order <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedures</b> have a considerable impact on the mix of jobs {{that need to be}} scheduled, by refusing specific jobs from the total demand. In this paper, we investigate whether jobs with specific characteristics are systematically rejected by an aggregate acceptance procedure and a detailed acceptance procedure. We find out that, while both procedures are selective in the kind of jobs they accept when job mix variety is high, the detailed acceptance procedure underestimates the consequences on the total makespan of significantly changing the job mix...|$|E

An additional study was carried out on O-ring and slab performance vs cure cycle and showed little sensitivity of material performance to large changes in curing time. Aging and spectra of certain materials indicated that two sets of test slabs from current vendor were accidently made from EPDM rather than butyl rubber.

40|$|Acceptance {{sampling}} procedures {{are widely used}} in industry {{as part of the}} total quality control activities. The acceptance procedure is usually constructed based on a set of statistical and/or economic requirements specified by the producer and/or the consumer. After the acceptance procedure is determined, the users are interested in evaluating its statistical and economic characteristics. This dissertation presents a comprehensive approach for constructing and evaluating acceptance {{sampling procedures}}. A large variety of statistical and economic characteristics is studied, from both the producer's and consumer's viewpoints. A part of the acceptance procedure is the sampling plan. Various statistical characteristics of the sampling plan are studied. The statistical evaluation of the acceptance procedure consists of analyzing these characteristics. The economic analysis includes identification of the possible actions during the acceptance procedure and evaluation of the producer's profit and the consumer's cost functions associated with each action. Guidelines for applying the statistical and economic characteristics in the evaluation process are presented. In a real situation, sampling may be subjected to inspection errors, which can affect the statistical and economic characteristics of the acceptance procedure; so all the characteristics were restudied for an error-prone sampling inspection. The statistical and economic characteristics are used to specify sets of requirements for constructing <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedures.</b> Selection of an appropriate set is based on the needs of the user, the available data, and the conditions under which the procedure is to be applied. The concluding step is to combine the construction and evaluation methods into an overall analysis cycle of "construct-evaluate-reconstruct. " Computer programs are given to facilitate application of the evaluation and construction processes. This study deals explicitly with single sampling plans for attributes. The analysis is based on the Bayesian approach in which the prior distribution is a mixed binomial with a beta weight function. However, the presented approach can be applied to any type of sampling and prior distribution. The results of the study can be used by decision makers as a tool to improve the use of <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedures</b> in a large variety of scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Batch process {{industries}} {{are characterized by}} complex precedence relationships among operations, which makes the estimation of an acceptable workload very difficult. Previous research indicated that a regression-based model that uses aggregate job set characteristics {{may be used to}} support order acceptance decisions. Applications of such models in real life assume that suffcient historical data on job sets and the corresponding makespans are available. In practice, however, historical data may be very limited and may not be suffcient to produce accurate regression estimates. This paper shows that such a lack of data significantly impacts the performance of regression-based order <b>acceptance</b> <b>procedures.</b> To resolve this problem, we devised a method that uses the bootstrap principle. A simulation study shows that performance improvements are obtained when using the parameters estimated from the bootstrapped data set, demonstrating that this bootstrapping procedure can indeed solve the limited data problem in production control...|$|E
