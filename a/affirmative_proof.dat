60|$|So {{much has}} been written of late years, {{touching}} the discovery of America, {{that it would not be}} at all surprising should there exist a disposition in a certain class of readers to deny the accuracy of all the statements in this work. Some may refer to history, with a view to prove that there never were such persons as our hero and heroine, and fancy that by establishing these facts, they completely destroy the authenticity of the whole book. In answer to this anticipated objection, we will state, that after carefully perusing several of the Spanish writers--from Cervantes to the translator of the journal of Columbus, the Alpha and Omega of peninsular literature--and after having read both Irving and Prescott from beginning to end, we do not find a syllable in either of them, that we understand to be conclusive evidence, or indeed to be any evidence at all, on the portions of our subject that are likely to be disputed. Until some solid <b>affirmative</b> <b>proof,</b> therefore, can be produced against us, we shall hold our case to be made out, and rest our claims to be believed on the authority of our own statements. Nor do we think there is any thing either unreasonable or unusual in this course, as perhaps the greater portion of that which is daily and hourly offered to the credence of the American public, rests on the same species of testimony--with the trifling difference that we state truths, with a profession of fiction, while the great moral caterers of the age state fiction with the profession of truth. If any advantage can be fairly obtained over us, in consequence of this trifling discrepancy, we must submit.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies stable sheaves on abelian {{surfaces}} of Picard number one. Our main tools are semi-homogeneous sheaves and Fourier-Mukai transforms. We introduce {{the notion of}} semi-homogeneous presentation and investigate the behavior of stable sheaves under Fourier-Mukai transforms. As a consequence, an <b>affirmative</b> <b>proof</b> {{is given to the}} conjecture proposed by Mukai in the 1980 s. This paper also includes an explicit description of the birational correspondence between the moduli spaces of stable sheaves and the Hilbert schemes. Comment: 50 page...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} an {{unavoidable}} set of words appears frequently {{in the fields of}} mathematics and theoretical computer science, in particular with its connection to the study of combinatorics on words. The theory of unavoidable sets has seen extensive study over the past twenty years. In this paper we extend the definition of unavoidable sets of words to unavoidable sets of partial words. Partial words, or finite sequences that may contain a number of “do not know ” symbols or “holes,” appear naturally in several areas of current interest such as molecular biology, data communication, and DNA computing. We demonstrate the utility of the notion of unavoidability of sets of partial words by making use of it to identify several new classes of unavoidable sets of full words. Along the way we begin work on classifying the unavoidable sets of partial words of small cardinality. We pose a conjecture, and show that <b>affirmative</b> <b>proof</b> of this conjecture gives a sufficient condition for classifying all the unavoidable sets of partial words of size two. We give a result which makes the conjecture easy to verify for a significant number of cases. We characterize many forms of unavoidable sets of partial words of size three over a binary alphabet, and completely characterize such sets over a ternary alphabet. Finally, we extend our results to unavoidable sets of partial words of size k over a k-letter alphabet. ∗This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foun...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe long-standing {{problem of}} the perfectness of the compactly {{supported}} equivariant homeomorphism group on a G-manifold (with one orbit type) is solved in the <b>affirmative.</b> The <b>proof</b> {{is based on an}} argument different than that for the case of diffeomorphisms. The theorem is a starting point for computing H 1 (HG(M)) for more complicated G-manifolds...|$|R
40|$|A real {{sequence}} {yi}∞i=−m {{defined by}} any y−m, y−m+ 1, [...] ., y− 1 ∈ (0,∞) and the rational recursive relation (1) will converge to 1. In [1], a question is raised {{as to whether}} a real sequence {yi}∞i=−m that satisfies (any) y−m, y−m+ 1, [...] ., y− 1 ∈ (0,∞) and yn = yn−kyn−lyn−m + yn−k + yn−l + yn−m yn−kyn−l + yn−kyn−m + yn−lyn−m + 1, n ∈ N 0 = { 0, 1, 2, [...] . }, (1) where k, l,m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < l < m, will converge to 1. Two different <b>affirmative</b> <b>proofs</b> are given in [2] and [3]. In this note, we offer another simple proof based on analysis of properties of subsequences of solutions of (1) (see e. g. [4] for another demonstration of such a technique). Since no unifying theory is available for rational recursive relations yet, such an addition may be of interest in future developments. Consider a slightly more general rational recursive relation yn...|$|R
50|$|The {{court found}} that the State of New York had {{reclassified}} provocation ("extreme emotional disturbance") as an excuse (an <b>affirmative</b> defense requiring <b>proof</b> by preponderance of the evidence), rather than a circumstance negating the mental element (mens rea) which the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, as was the situation in Mullaney v. Wilbur (1975).|$|R
40|$|The Johnson graph J(n,i) {{is defined}} to the graph whose vertex set is {{the set of}} all {{i-element}} subsets of { 1, [...] .,n}, and two vertices are joined whenever the cardinality of their intersection is equal to i- 1. In Ramras and Donovan [SIAM J. Discrete Math, 25 (1) : 267 - 270, 2011], it is conjectured that if n= 2 i, then the automorphism group of the Johnson graph J(n,i) is S_n ×〈 T 〉, where T is the complementation map A { 1, [...] .,n}∖ A. We resolve this conjecture in the <b>affirmative.</b> The <b>proof</b> uses only elementary group theory {{and is based on}} an analysis of the clique structure of the graph...|$|R
40|$|We {{prove that}} if (M^n,g), n > 4, is a compact, orientable, locally {{irreducible}} Riemannian manifold with nonnegative isotropic curvature, {{then one of}} the following possibilities hold: (i) M admits a metric with positive isotropic curvature (ii) (M,g) is isometric to a locally symmetric space (iii) (M,g) is Kähler and biholomorphic to P^n/ 2. (iv) (M,g) is quaternionic-Kähler. This is implied by the following result: Let (M^ 2 n,g) be a compact, locally irreducible Kähler manifold with nonnegative isotropic curvature. Then either M is biholomorphic to P^n or isometric to a compact Hermitian symmetric space. This answers a question of Micallef and Wang in the <b>affirmative.</b> The <b>proof</b> is based on the recent work of S. Brendle and R. Schoen on the Ricci flow. Comment: 12 Page...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} known for more than 40 years that there are posets with planar cover graphs and {{arbitrarily}} large dimension. Recently, Streib and Trotter proved that such posets must have large height. In fact, all known constructions of such posets have two large disjoint chains with all points in one chain incomparable with all points in the other. Gutowski and Krawczyk conjectured that this feature is necessary. More formally, they conjectured that for every k≥ 1, there is a constant d such that if P is a poset with planar cover graph and P excludes k+k, then (P) ≤ d. We settle their conjecture in the <b>affirmative.</b> The <b>proof</b> involves some intermediate results that we believe are of independent interest...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA result {{originally}} due to Baeten, Bergstra, and Klop {{shows that}} strong bisimulation equivalence for normed BPA processes is decidable. On the other hand, Huynh and Tian, and Groote and Hüttel, have proved that all other standard equivalences are undecidable for normed BPA and thus for BPA in general, The open problem remaining has been whether bisimulation is decidable {{for the full}} BPA language. In this paper, we answer this question in the <b>affirmative,</b> using a <b>proof</b> technique based on the proof by Caucal of the decidability of language equivalence for simple algebraic grammars. The decision procedure relies on our main result, extending that of Caucal, that the maximal bisimulation of any BPA transition graph is finitely representable as a Thue congruence. The decision procedure consists of two semi-decision procedures, one testing for non-bisimilarity and one testing for bisimilarity...|$|R
