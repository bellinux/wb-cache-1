In 1768, upon the expulsion of the Jesuits, the town was transferred to the Augustinian Recollects.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-18th century, a {{succession}} of public buildings were erected in the town. St Paul's Church, now demolished, was among the first, while the old Town Hall <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> Cutlers' Hall were among the major works of the 19th century. The town's water supply was improved by the Sheffield Waterworks Company, who built reservoirs around the town. Parts of Sheffield were devastated when, following a five-year construction project, the Dale Dyke dam collapsed on Friday 11 March 1864, resulting in the Great Sheffield Flood.|$|E

5|$|Architecture {{in modern}} Scotland {{encompasses}} all building in Scotland, between {{the beginning of}} the twentieth century <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> day. The most significant architect of the early twentieth century was Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who mixed elements of traditional Scottish architecture with contemporary movements. Estate house design declined in importance in the twentieth century. In the early decades of the century, traditional materials began to give way to cheaper modern ones. After the First World War modernism and the office block began to dominate building in the major cities and attempts began to improve the quality of urban housing for the poor, resulted in a massive programme of council house building. The Neo-Gothic style continued in to the twentieth century but the most common forms in this period were plain and massive Neo-Romanesque buildings.|$|E

5|$|Auberge d'Italie was {{the third}} Italian auberge {{to be built in}} Malta.

This building was eventually incorporated into the Grandmaster's Palace, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> auberge began to be built in Strada San Giacomo (now Merchants Street).

5|$|Between 2003 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present,</b> Paes has {{increasingly}} {{focused on his}} doubles and mixed doubles game. Leander won the mixed doubles events at the Australian Open and Wimbledon with Martina Navratilova, both in 2003. Weeks after the win at Wimbledon, Paes {{was admitted to the}} MD Anderson Cancer Center for a suspected brain tumour that was later found to be neurocysticercosis, a parasitic brain infection. While being treated, he had to miss the US Open, but he recovered {{by the end of that}} year. In the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, he paired up with Bhupathi, failing again at the semifinals stage. His next Grand Slam success was in the US Open doubles event in 2006 with Martin Damm. Paes led the Indian tennis team at the Doha Asian Games in 2006 and won two golds in the men's doubles (partnering Bhupathi) and mixed doubles (partnering Sania Mirza). Paes maintained his doubles ranking in the top 20 in the world between 2005 and 2007. With wins in the Rotterdam and Indian Wells, Paes took his doubles tally to 38.|$|E
