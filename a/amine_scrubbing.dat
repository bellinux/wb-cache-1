5000|$|Firstly, Ca-looping offers greater cost {{advantage}} compared to conventional amine-scrubbing technologies. The cost/metric ton for CO2 captured through Ca-looping is ~$23.70 whereas that for CO2 captured through <b>amine</b> <b>scrubbing</b> is about $35-$96. [...] This {{can be attributed}} to the high availability and low cost of the CaO sorbent (derived from limestone) as compared to MEA. Also, as discussed in section 2, Ca-looping imposes a lower energy penalty than <b>amine</b> <b>scrubbing,</b> resulting in lower energy costs. The <b>amine</b> <b>scrubbing</b> process is energy intensive, with approximately 67% of the operating costs going into steam requirements for solvent regeneration.

The post-combustion CO 2 capture system using <b>amine</b> wet <b>scrubbing</b> is investigated in detail for natural-gas fired power plant from pilot-scale to commercial-scale level. The research work is focused on the investigation of the different innovative modifications to the micro gas turbine (MGT) including exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), steam injection and humid air turbine. The process models are developed for both MGT and pilot-scale amine-based CO 2 capture plant. The MGT model is tuned and validated with extensive experimental data at different part load conditions for base case, CO 2, steam and simultaneous CO 2 and steam injection to the default MGT. The thermodynamic behaviour, emissions, system efficiency and the sensitivity of the base case MGT for ambient conditions are explored. The robust model is extended for EGR, steam injection and humid air turbine system models; and process system performance comparison for the different modifications is assessed for possible recommendation. In addition, the impact of the operating conditions and locations of the EGR on the performance of the MGT is also analysed. Further, the effect of the enhanced CO 2 on the extensively validated pilot-scale amine-based CO 2 capture plant integrated with MGT is examined.

Optimization and rule-based models are used to simulate a 500 megawatt coal-fired facility that adjusts the operating point of its <b>amine</b> CO 2 <b>scrubbing</b> system to maximize profits in response to volatile electricity prices. Between CO 2 prices of 20 and 70 U. S. dollars per metric ton (USD/ tCO 2), a flexible capture system that vents CO 2 while increasing power output can maintain significant CO 2 emissions reductions while improving annual operating profits by up to 10 % over inflexible capture. The benefits of venting diminish at high CO 2 prices, but a solvent storage system that permits high CO 2 absorption during partial-load stripping and compression achieves a 9 – 29 % profit advantage at 30 – 100 USD/ tCO 2. Profit improvements with flexibility appear insensitive to CO 2 capture ramping limitations.

40|$|Electric power {{generation}} {{represents one of}} the largest sources of CO 2 emissions in North America. A major issue in the analysis of CO 2 mitigation options is the fact that over 45 % of total electric {{power generation}} in North America is from coal. These existing coal-based power plants have the highest CO 2 emissions of any power systems yet are the lowest cost electric generators. Retrofit CO 2 reduction or recovery of existing coal-based power plants has definite advantages—using the existing site infrastructure, having facilities that are mostly paid-off or amortized, and having high baseline CO 2 emissions. However, retrofits also have disadvantages—significant capacity and efficiency losses that require replacement capacity addition, and increased fuel use depending on the choice of CO 2 mitigation technology. TransAlta is a major coal-based electric power generator in Canada and the United States. As discussed at www. transalta. com in the Sustainable Development section under “Our Actions,” TransAlta has a goal of zero net greenhouse gas emission (including trading and offsets) for its Canadian operations by 2024.

50|$|Calcium looping compares {{favorably with}} several {{post-combustion}} capture technologies. <b>Amine</b> <b>scrubbing</b> is the capture technology closest to being market-ready, and calcium looping has several marked benefits over it. When modeled on a 580 MW coal-fired power plant, Calcium looping experienced {{not only a}} smaller efficiency penalty (6.7-7.9% points compared to 9.5% for monoethanolamine and 9% for chilled ammonia) but also a less complex retrofitting process. Both technologies would require the plant to be retrofitted for adoption, but the calcium looping retrofitting process would result in twice the net power output of the scrubbing technology. Furthermore, this advantage can be compounded by introducing technology such as cryogenic O2 storage systems. This ups {{the efficiency of the}} calcium looping technology by increasing the energy density by 57.4%, making the already low energy penalties even less of an issue.|$|E
5000|$|Calcium looping is {{considered}} as potential promising solutions to reduce CO2 [...] capture energy penalty. There are many advantages from the calcium looping methods.

5000|$|Chattanooga Process is an {{extraction}} process {{that uses a}} fluidized bed reactor and an associated hydrogen-fired heater. In this process, retorting occurs at relatively low temperatures (...) through thermal cracking and hydrogenation of the shale into hydrocarbon vapors and spent solids.

50|$|Landfill gas can be {{converted}} to high-Btu gas by reducing its carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and oxygen content. The high-Btu gas can be piped into existing natural gas pipelines or in the form of CNG (compressed natural gas) or LNG (liquid natural gas). CNG and LNG can be used on site to power hauling trucks or equipment or sold commercially. Three commonly used methods to extract the carbon dioxide from the gas are membrane separation, molecular sieve, and <b>amine</b> <b>scrubbing.</b> Oxygen and nitrogen are controlled by the proper design and operation of the landfill since the primary cause for oxygen or nitrogen in the gas is intrusion from outside into the landfill because of a difference in pressure. The high-Btu processing equipment can be expected to cost $2,600 to $4,300 per standard cubic foot per minute (scfm) of landfill gas. Annual costs range from $875,000 to $3.5 million to operate, maintain and provide electricity to. Costs depend on quality of the end product gas as well as the size of the project. The first landfill gas to LNG facility in the United States was the Frank R. Bowerman Landfill in Orange County, California. The same process is used for the conversion to CNG, but on a smaller scale. The CNG project at Puente Hills Landfill in Los Angeles has realized $1.40 per gallon of gasoline equivalent with the flow rate of 250 scfm. Cost per gallon equivalent reduces as the flow rate of gas increases. LNG can be produced through the liquidfication of CNG. However, the oxygen content needs to be reduced to be under 0.5% to avoid explosion concerns, the carbon dioxide content must be as close to zero as possible to avoid freezing problems encountered in the production, and nitrogen must be reduced enough to achieve at least 96% methane. A $20 million facility is estimated to achieve $0.65/gallon for a plant producing 15,000 gallons/day of LNG (3,000 scfm). Estimates are in 2007 dollars.|$|E

40|$|<b>Amine</b> <b>scrubbing</b> is {{a proven}} {{technology}} in {{the oil and gas}} industries. Its use in coal fired power plants is not fully understood and the likelihood of solvent degradation is high. Decreased absorption efficiency, undesirable by-products and the environmental impact of their disposal are the main consequences. In the present study, samples of monoethanolamine were thermally degraded, at 160 °C for between 2 and 8 weeks, and their CO 2 removal capacity deterioration was determined. The findings show that thermal degradation at 160 °C for 8 weeks reduced monoethanolamine concentration by 95 %, but the remaining solvent still retained 22 % of its capacity to remove CO 2, probably due to the capacity of some of the degradation products to remove CO 2. Therefore, the requirement for monoethanolamine make-up in operational <b>amine</b> <b>scrubbing</b> systems may not be quite as serious as initially believed. A 20 % higher MEA loss was determined in the samples with 0. 37 initial CO 2 loading (mol CO 2 /mol MEA). 2 -Oxazolidone, N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) -ethylenediamine and 1 -(2 -hydroxyethyl) - 2 -imidazolidinone were identified as the major monoethanolamine degradation products, the latter being indicated as the most stable product with concentrations of up to 17 % (v/v).

Oxygen-enriched air rather than air {{is used as}} an oxidizer in the OEC technology. Unlike flue gas treatment technologies, OEC directly impacts the NOx formation process by significantly reducing the conversion of coal bound nitrogen to NOx. Pilot-scale and full-scale tests have shown 20 to 30 % NOx reduction from an optimized staged-air baseline.

The impact of CO 2 capture has been calculated with the Aspen plus' software. With an O- 2 purity of 90 mol. % and an 85 % CO 2 recovery rate, the net electrical efficiency reaches 51. 3 % (based on the low heating value (LHV)). This corresponds to an efficiency loss of 8. 1 %-points in comparison with the base case. The quantity of avoided CO 2 is about 280 g kW(- 1) h(- 1).

From the results, an optimal sorption system is discussed and a research direction of process design is suggested to improve the process economy of the solid sorbent-based carbon capture processes...|$|E
