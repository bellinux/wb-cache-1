Charter is {{generally}} considered to be jus cogens (literally: [...] "compelling law", in practice: [...] "higher international law"), and prohibits all UN members from exercising [...] "the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state". But in the modern framework of the UN Charter, it is the phrase [...] "armed attack occurs" [...] in Article 51 that draws the line between legitimate and illegitimate military force. From this {{it is reasonable to assume}} that if no armed attack has yet occurred that no <b>automatic</b> <b>justification</b> for preemptive 'self-defense' has yet been made 'legal' under the UN Charter. In order to be justified as an act of self-defense, two conditions must be fulfilled which are widely regarded as necessary for its justification. The first of these is that actor must have believed that the threat is real, as opposed to (merely) perceived. The second condition is that the force used in self-defense must be proportional to the harm which the actor is threatened. When it comes to a situation where an armed attack is considered as a self-defense, it usually narrows realistic options for avoidance by nonviolent means such as negotiation, retreat, or calling upon higher authorities (such as the police or the UN).|$|E
50|$|When {{the line}} is {{assembled}} to the correct length, the operator presses down on a lever which raises the assembling elevator up into the delivery channel and starts the automatic casting cycle. The delivery channel transfers the matrices out of the assembler and into the first elevator. The first elevator then descends to a position {{in front of the}} mold, and if the elevator has not descended fully by the time the machine starts the process of aligning the matrices (most often caused by a ‘tight’ line), the first of the two safeties - the vise automatic - brings the machine to a full stop before the supporting lugs on the matrices are crushed by the mold. Once the matrices are in proper position, two actions take place in sequence: the matrices are aligned vertically and face-wise while a bar rises from below to force the movable sleeves on the space bands upwards to cause them to fill out the line to the exact width of the mold. If the justification bar has made a full cycle and {{the line is}} still not fully justified, the second safety - the pump stop - prevents the plunger in the metal pot from going down. The space bands were an important feature of this machine, providing <b>automatic</b> <b>justification</b> of each line by equally adjusting the white space between each word. Since the type used was proportional and not fixed in width, solving this justification problem mechanically was very important. Some later models had a feature that permitted the lines to be cast with the alignment to either left, right or centered. Operators running earlier models would use special ‘blank’ matrices (in 4 sizes) to manually create the proper amount of whitespace beyond the space bands’ range.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of Korean {{municipal}} orchestras which focuses on both {{the internal and external}} environment in order to examine and better understand arguments that they face 'challenges' that are not to be solved simply through 'efficiency' or 'better organisation', but are part of wider socio-cultural change that previous studies have failed to take adequately into consideration. This study, therefore, examines diverse aspects of the difficulties faced by contemporary Korean municipal orchestras while addressing five research questions concerning Korean cultural policy, the socio-economic context in which orchestras operate, job satisfaction, interpersonal conflict, and diminishing local government funding. In pursuit of this investigation, a triangulation methodology is adopted, which includes the scrutiny of documentation along with qualitative in-depth interviews (with orchestral players, administrative staff, and civil servants) and a quantitative questionnaire survey (with 128 players and 10 administrative staff). The research findings are given in detail in relevant chapters, but the key findings may be summarised here as follows: Political, economic, historic, and socio-cultural factors have greatly influenced the cultural policy of the Korean central government, but Korean municipal orchestras are influenced more by policies of local governments who provide them with a source of funding. Players in Korean municipal orchestras are highly satisfied with their work but dissatisfied with present pay, lack of authority, and the hierarchical structure. Orchestral administrative staff are dissatisfied with lack of autonomy and promotion. Male players have higher perception of intrapersonal conflict and intergroup conflict compared to female players, and male players have a greater preference for using integrating and compromising styles when managing interpersonal conflict with peers. Korean municipal orchestras, having a public service role, have been used to receiving relatively stable financial aid from local governments, but this has created a lack of commercial awareness about what is required to bolster their legitimacy in the face of potential financial cuts and small audiences. The 'civilizing mission' of the arts is no longer accepted as <b>automatic</b> <b>justification.</b> Although a complete governance change is considered a key factor for the success of municipal orchestras, such change is inadequate in itself: the real challenge for a brighter future lies with players, administrative staff, and the cities and their cooperation.

40|$|In two brief {{chapters}} this thesis, {{which is}} perhaps {{more of an}} essay than a conventional research paper, re-presents the leading ideas of a popular sermon by Luther from {{a time of great}} importance {{in the life of the}} reformer, when the Reformation was an aspect of Catholicism, acting both as a corrective to, and a dependent of, religious fear (of the wrath of God). The leading motif of the thesis is a theology of saving Despair. In chapter one, with particular reference to St. Bernard and the treatise De Captivitate Babylonica. the image of Christ Crucified is developed first as an icon of the just anger of the Father, which, operating sacramentally as the "opus alienum Dei", prompts Despair and Faith in the contemplator on the Cross. Second, the Cross is interpreted as revealing the effect of the incarnation, in a non-soteriological context, as a crisis of natural anger within God - an inner-trinitarian "opus alienum" of the Father towards the Son. In chapter two, with particular reference to the tract Von der Freiheit eines Christenmenschen / de libertate Christiana. Christ Crucified is understood as "exemplum" for works of Righteousness, which follow as an <b>automatic</b> consequence of <b>Justification,</b> and for works of Self- Righteousness, which form a prelude and precondition for Justification. The Church is seen as committed to political action on behalf of a Utopian Kingdom of God on earth, an ideal which operates as the Law for modern man. For the reader's convenience, an edited text of the Sermon with an early English translation (by William Gace) is appended...|$|R
