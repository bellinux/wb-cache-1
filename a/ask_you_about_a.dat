5000|$|Abu Musa reported: There {{cropped up}} a {{difference}} of opinion between a group of Muhajirs (Emigrants) and a group of Ansar (Helpers) (and the point of dispute was) that the Ansar said: The bath (because of sexual intercourse) becomes obligatory only-when the semen spurts out or ejaculates. But the Muhajirs said: When a man has sexual intercourse (with the woman), a bath becomes obligatory (no matter {{whether or not there is}} seminal emission or ejaculation). Abu Musa said: Well, I satisfy you on this (issue). He (Abu Musa, the narrator) said: I got up (and went) to 'A'isha and sought her permission and it was granted, and I said to her: O Mother, or Mother of the Faithful, I want to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> matter on which I feel shy. She said: Don't feel shy of asking me about a thing which you can ask your mother, who gave you birth, for I am too your mother. Upon this I said: What makes a bath obligatory for a person? She replied: You have come across one well informed! The Messenger of Allah said: When anyone sits amidst four parts (of the woman) and the circumcised parts touch each other a bath becomes obligatory.|$|E

I am thinking of a desperate step--of calling on the woman Charmond. I am going to appeal to her, since Grace will not. 'Tis she who holds the balance in her hands--not he.

60|$|How can I {{make this}} {{confident}} assertion, <b>you</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> gentleman whom I never personally saw, and whose habits {{the intervention of}} five hundred centuries has precluded me from studying at close quarters? At first sight, you would suppose the evidence on such a point must be purely negative. The reconstructive historian must surely be inventing à priori facts, evolved, more Germanico, from his inner consciousness. Not so. See how clever modern archæology has become! I base my assertion upon solid evidence. I know that Primitive Man was ambidextrous, because he wrote and painted just as often with his left as with his right, and just as successfully.|$|R

There's something hopeless and very sad <b>about</b> this feeling. <b>You</b> <b>asked</b> me <b>about</b> <b>a</b> child, and I said what I did because I'm not thinking that far ahead—because a child is the most wonderful creation and the final bond {{between a man and a}} woman (at least, that's how I see it, or let's say, that's how it should be and how I'd want it to be). And I'm not thinking that far ahead because I'm not convinced it's eternal. I only wish I could free myself of this doubt." ...|$|R

"When {{the shock}} came that afternoon," [...] {{continued}} the clerk, [...] "the express bag for Sacramento and Marysville {{had just been}} taken out by the expressman, and was lying {{on top of the}} waggon. The horses started to run at the second shock, and the bag fell and was jammed against a lamp-post in front of our window, bursting open as it did so and spilling some letters and papers on the side-walk. One of our night watchmen helped the expressman pick up the scattered letters, and picked up among them a plain yellow envelope with no address but the name of Gabriel Conroy written in pencil across the end. Supposing it had dropped from some package in the express bag, he put it back again in the bag. When <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> blank envelope missing from your desk, he did not connect it with the one he had picked up, for that had writing on it. We sent to the express office just now, and found that they had stamped it, and forwarded it to Conroy at One Horse Gulch, just as they had always done with his letters sent to our care. That's the way of it. Daresay it's there by this time, in his hands, sir, all right!" ...|$|R
40|$|In intuitionistic linear logic, a {{proposition}} A {{can be thought}} of as a resource which can (and must) be used exactly one time. Linear logic also has the persistent modality!A, which represents persistent propositions that can be used any number of times. The midterm <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> to think <b>about</b> <b>an</b> affine modality @A = A � 1, representing resources that could be used at most once, and a strict modality #A = A ⊗!A, representing resources that you must use, but may use one more more times. In this note, we’ll look at another way to think about the relationship between persistent, affine, strict, and linear logics, based on Gentzen’s original presentation of a sequent calculus for persistent intuitionistic logic. Then, we’ll use that discussion to motivate ordered logic. 1 Gentzen’s presentation of logic In 1935, Gentzen presented the first sequent calculus for (persistent) intuitionistic and classical logic [Gen 35]. That paper is in German, but the various English translations (the translated title is “Investigations into Logical Deduction”) are extraordinarily readable for a modern audience. We’ll write Gentzen-style sequents as Ψ − → A. One important distinction is that Gentzen treated Ψ not as a bag or multiset, the way we do, but as a sequence – so when we write the usual implication and initial rules as they appear in Gentzen’s paper [...] . A − → A ini...|$|R
40|$|Have {{you ever}} been to a general store in West Texas? They have {{everything}} from horse feed to can openers. The tough part is finding it. You approach the store manager and first ask him how everything is going and how his family is. Then he <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> yours. Within <b>a</b> few minutes, he asks what he can do for <b>you.</b> When <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> for an oil filter remover, he responds, “I am sure we have one here somewhere. ” You get your oil filter remover and go on your way. I go to general stores because I like the culture there. It is one of respect for its customers and respect for its employees. Evidently, many other people like it too. Every Saturday, the place is packed. If you are in a hurry, they will surely slow you down, but they will demonstrate respect. Believe it or not, there is a business lesson here. It is a lesson on business culture, and here are some tips on how to turn your culture into a competitive advantage. Every Company Has a Culture Every company has a culture. It is reflected in the way people do business every day with customers, suppliers, and most importantly, with each other. Culture is the set of values that guide people’s behavior in the workplace. It drives how they determine if people are more important than profits, if profits are more important than people or if nobody cares one way or the other. For better or worse, a company culture will inevitably develop in your company. The question <b>you</b> must <b>ask</b> is whether <b>you</b> are developing your culture consciously or are backing into it by default. Culture Starts with Value...|$|R
