5|$|At (1:18), the song's main melody is introduced, {{played by}} a guitar, the bass guitar and a glockenspiel, with <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> {{progression}} of E minor, C major seventh, G major, and D major. This is repeated until (3:28), when the guitars fade out into the background, and the drumbeat ends, leaving only the ride cymbal to keep the beat, and the main melody, which is repeated until it gradually fades out, leaving ambient guitar noise.|$|E
5|$|George Reid {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non-Labour lines – prior to the 1906 election, he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionist Party in the middle. This attempt struck <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> with politicians who were steeped in the Westminster tradition and regarded a two-party system as very much the norm.|$|E
5|$|No {{effort to}} depict vampires in popular fiction was as {{influential}} or as definitive as Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897). Its portrayal of vampirism {{as a disease}} of contagious demonic possession, with its undertones of sex, blood and death, struck <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> in Victorian Europe where tuberculosis and syphilis were common. The vampiric traits described in Stoker's work merged with and dominated folkloric tradition, eventually evolving into the modern fictional vampire.|$|E
50|$|In music theory, <b>a</b> nondominant seventh <b>chord</b> is both <b>a</b> {{diatonic}} <b>chord</b> and <b>a</b> seventh <b>chord,</b> but it {{does not}} possess dominant function, and thus it is not <b>a</b> dominant seventh <b>chord.</b>|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{techniques}} in jazz reharmonization is the use of substitute <b>chords,</b> through <b>a</b> technique known as tritone substitution. In tritone substitution, <b>a</b> dominant <b>chord</b> is replaced by another dominant <b>chord</b> <b>a</b> tritone above its tonic. This technique is {{based on the fact that}} the third and seventh degrees of <b>a</b> dominant <b>chord</b> are enharmonically the same as the seventh and third degrees of the dominant <b>chord</b> <b>a</b> tritone away. For example, B and F, the third and seventh of <b>a</b> G7 <b>chord,</b> are enharmonic equivalents of C and F, the seventh and third of <b>a</b> D7 <b>chord.</b> Since the tritone is a distinguishing feature of the sound of <b>a</b> dominant 7th <b>chord,</b> <b>a</b> D7 <b>chord</b> may thus replace G7.|$|R

5|$|By 1876, Macdonald and the Conservatives {{had adopted}} {{protection}} as party policy. This view was widely promoted in speeches {{at a number}} of political picnics, held across Ontario during the summer of 1876. Macdonald's proposals struck <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> with the public, and the Conservatives began to win a string of by-elections. By the end of 1876, the Tories had picked up 14seats as a result of by-elections, reducing Mackenzie's Liberal majority from 70 to 42. Despite the success, Macdonald considered retirement, wishing only to reverse the voters' verdict of 1874—he considered Charles Tupper his heir apparent.|$|E
5|$|Kind of Blue {{is based}} entirely on modality, in {{contrast}} to Davis's earlier work with the hard bop style of jazz and its complex chord progression and improvisation. The entire album was composed {{as a series of}} modal sketches, in which each performer was given a set of scales that defined the parameters of their improvisation and style. This style was {{in contrast to}} more typical means of composing, such as providing musicians with a complete score or, as was more common for improvisational jazz, providing the musicians with <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> progression or series of harmonies.|$|E
5|$|Written for piano, guitar, and mandolin, {{the music}} {{begins in the}} key of G major with an Andante Moderato tempo. The verses follow <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> {{progression}} of G–C–G. The chorus transitions to B minor, and progresses as B–E–E, before returning to G–C–G in its final bars. Although the melody of the chorus is unique within the piece, it is in harmonic unity with the verses. An upbeat version played at a Andantino tempo was also adapted for play by small orchestras and big bands.|$|E
50|$|Another {{notation}} is ind, designating the chord as 'indeterminate'. This {{refers to}} the fact that <b>a</b> power <b>chord</b> is neither major nor minor, as there is no third present. This gives the power <b>chord</b> <b>a</b> chameleon-like property; if played where <b>a</b> major <b>chord</b> might be expected, it can sound like <b>a</b> major <b>chord,</b> but when played where <b>a</b> minor <b>chord</b> might be expected, it sounds minor.|$|R

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} of the imagination, and a free-flowing connection to the unconscious brought about a renewed interest in his work. Bosch's imagery struck <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> with Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of Bosch's Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|E
5|$|It is {{constructed}} in a verse-pre-chorus-chorus form, with a bridge before {{the third and}} fourth chorus. It starts with an instrumental introduction, and uses <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> progression of C–B–Am7–G, that is also used during the verses and the chorus. In the first verse, Halliwell, Chisholm, Bunton, and Beckham sing each one line. The chords change to Dm11–Dm9–Dm11–Dm9–Dm7–Em7–F major7–G during the pre-chorus, followed by the chorus. The same pattern occurs leading to the second chorus, {{the first part of the}} second verse consists on the repeated use of the words do and ba da, then Bunton and Chisholm sing the rest of the verse. The group then sing the bridge, and end the song repeating the chorus twice. The song uses the verse melody of When You Were Mine (Prince song) with slightly altered phrasing.|$|E
5|$|Land mine: Textual {{evidence}} suggests that the first use of a land mine in history was by a Song Dynasty brigadier general known as Lou Qianxia, who used an 'enormous bomb' (huo pao) to kill Mongol soldiers invading Guangxi in 1277. However, the first detailed description of the land mine was given in the Huolongjing text written by Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and Liu Bowen (1311–1375) during the late Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) and early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Jiao and Liu wrote that land mines were spherical, made of cast iron, and their fuses ignited by a mechanism tripped by enemy movement; although Jiao and Liu did not describe this trip mechanism in full detail, a later text of 1606 revealed that enemy movement released a pin that allowed hidden underground weights to fall and spin <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> around an axle that rotated a spinning wheel acting as a flint to spark a train of fuses.|$|E

5000|$|The Bridge <b>chord</b> is <b>a</b> bitonal <b>chord</b> {{named after}} {{its use in}} the music of {{composer}} Frank Bridge (1879-1941).

5|$|The {{information}} Bukovsky {{had gathered}} {{and sent to}} the West galvanized human rights activists worldwide and those within the Soviet Union. It also struck <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> among psychiatrists. In September that year 44 European psychiatrists wrote to The Times (London) expressing grave doubts about the diagnoses of the six people concerned. At a meeting in November 1971, the World Federation for Mental Health called on its members to investigate the charges and defend the right to free opinion where it was threatened. These responses were carefully documented by the dissident human rights periodical Chronicle of Current Events, which also recorded the many statements made by Bukovsky's friends and fellow rights activists in his defence. As the person at the centre of this unprecedented international row, Bukovsky waited in almost total isolation, without access to a lawyer, to be tried {{and sent to the}} camps or a special psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|The song is {{constructed}} in a verse-chorus form, with a bridge before the third chorus, and its instrumentation {{comes from a}} guitar, brass and string instruments. It starts with an instrumental introduction, with <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> progression of A–Faug–Dmaj7–G7 that is also used during {{the first part of}} the verses and the chorus. Brown and Bunton sing the first lines of the first verse; the progression then changes to Bm7–E–Dmaj7–C♯7 during the last part of the verse, which is sung by Chisholm. After the chorus, the same pattern occurs leading to the second chorus, with Halliwell, Beckham, and Chisholm singing the second verse. The progression changes to Bm7–C♯m7–Gmaj9–F♯7(♯9) as Chisholm sings the bridge, while the rest of the group adds the high harmony. The group sing the chorus twice, and repeats the ad-lib as the song fades out. The album version, which is forty seconds longer than the radio edit, features an instrumental section at the end of the track.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} {{to all of the}} ways of building chords (listed above), <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> may be inverted. Inverting <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> refers to playing <b>a</b> <b>chord,</b> but with a note other than the root as the lowest note of the chord. Take, for example, the C major and the C dominant seventh chords. Refer to the tables below for a list of inversions.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the song}} begins with <b>an</b> <b>A</b> power <b>chord,</b> {{the song is}} in C Major, {{consisting}} primarily of C and F major <b>chords,</b> <b>A</b> minor <b>chords,</b> and the dominant, G7 chords.|$|R

50|$|The {{parallel}} chord (but not {{the counter}} parallel <b>chord)</b> of <b>a</b> major <b>chord</b> {{will always be}} the minor chord whose root is a minor third down from the major chord's root, inversely the parallel <b>chord</b> of <b>a</b> minor <b>chord</b> will be the major chord whose root is a minor third up from the root of the minor <b>chord.</b> Thus, in <b>a</b> major key, where the dominant is <b>a</b> major <b>chord,</b> the dominant parallel will be the minor <b>chord</b> <b>a</b> minor third below the dominant. In a minor key, where the dominant may be <b>a</b> minor <b>chord,</b> the dominant parallel will be the major <b>chord</b> <b>a</b> minor third above the (minor) dominant.|$|R

This {{can be seen by}} building up the graph by adding pendant vertices, false twins, and true twins, at each step building up a corresponding set of chords representing the graph. Adding a pendant vertex corresponds to adding <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> near the endpoints of an existing chord so that it crosses only that chord; adding false twins corresponds to replacing <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> by two parallel chords crossing the same set of other chords; and adding true twins corresponds to replacing <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> by two chords that cross each other but are nearly parallel and cross the same set of other chords.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>chord</b> {{progression}} {{can begin}} {{on either side}} of clave.
