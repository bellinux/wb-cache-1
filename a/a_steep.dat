5|$|Alison Redford {{subsequently}} {{was elected}} party leader {{and became the}} first female Premier of Alberta. Despite strong opposition from the Wildrose Party that most polls and media predicted would end the PC's 41-year dynasty, Redford and the PC party won re-election in April 2012, making Redford Alberta's first elected female premier. Due to <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> decline in approval ratings and a spending controversy, Alison Redford announced her resignation on March 19, 2014, as premier of Alberta, effective March 23.|$|E
5|$|Although {{adequate}} for the town's residents the new stations were {{a long way}} from the seafront attractions, which were at the foot of <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> hill. The day-trippers on whom Ramsgate's tourist industry depended were therefore increasingly attracted to Margate, where the station was next to the beach.|$|E
5|$|As the {{incipient}} ocean widened in the Late Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic, {{it broke}} the continental crust {{in two and}} a true ocean basin developed to the west. All the earlier formations were thus dissected along <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> front on {{the two halves of}} the previous continent. A wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate {{at the base of the}} two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves.|$|E
50|$|Compared with ditches, tunnels had the {{important}} advantage {{that the water}} flowing through them underground could not freeze up. The tunnels were laid primarily to short cut the long ditch runs around mountains. Such cuts also produced <b>a</b> <b>steeper</b> incline (shorter distances descending the same height difference have <b>a</b> <b>steeper</b> slope). This raised the flow velocity and hence the hydraulic capacity of the watercourse. The disadvantage of tunnels was the high investment cost of building them.|$|R

5|$|At {{the base}} of the first drop, the train banks a few degrees to the right and climbs the first air-time hill and descends. Following this, the train climbs up to a hairpin 180-degree hammerhead turn to the left. The train descends from the height of the turn to travel up and over three more air-time hills. After the hills, the train climbs up <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> slope into the mid-course brake run.|$|E
5|$|Cromer High {{railway station}} {{was the first}} station opened in Cromer, {{situated}} to the south {{on the outskirts of}} the town on <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> escarpment. Built initially by the short-lived East Norfolk Railway, the station (along with the line) was incorporated into the Great Eastern Railway, who had operated the services from the beginning. It served as the terminus of Great Eastern Railway services from London and Norwich. Initially named Cromer on opening, it was renamed Cromer High on 27 September 1948.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{designed}} to fire at trajectories with <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> angle of descent, howitzers can be fired directly, {{as was done}} by the 11th Marine Regiment at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, during the Korean War. Two field batteries fired directly upon a battalion of Chinese infantry; the Marines were forced to brace themselves against their howitzers, as they had no time to dig them in. The Chinese infantry took heavy casualties, and were forced to retreat.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between stock returns and the implied volatility smile slope of call and put options. Stocks with <b>a</b> <b>steeper</b> put slope earn lower future returns, while stocks with <b>a</b> <b>steeper</b> call slope earn higher future returns. Using dispersion of opinion {{as a proxy for}} belief differences, we find that the slope-stock return relation is strongest for stocks with high belief differences. The idiosyncratic component of the put slope fully explains the negative risk-adjusted stock returns. For the call slope, the idiosyncratic component dominates the systematic one, and explains the positive risk-adjusted returns...|$|R

5|$|I-68 {{begins at}} exit148 on I-79 near Morgantown and runs eastward, meeting with US119 one mile (1.6km) east of its {{terminus}} at I-79. I-68 turns northeastward, curving around Morgantown, with four interchanges in the Morgantown area—I-79, US119, WV7, and WV705. Leaving the Morgantown area, I-68 again runs eastward, interchanging with WV43, which {{provides access to}} Cheat Lake and Uniontown, Pennsylvania. Near this interchange, I-68 passes over Cheat Lake and climbs <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> ascent out of Cheat Canyon.|$|E
5|$|In {{their summer}} camps, {{starting}} in January, male grey-headed flying foxes set up mating territories. Mating territories are generally 3.5 body lengths along branches. These flying foxes' neck glands enlarge in {{males in the}} mating season, and are used to mark the territories. The males fight to maintain their territories, and this is associated with <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> drop in the males' body condition during this time.|$|E

5|$|On 2 April, local villagers buried Stojanović on <b>a</b> <b>steep,</b> wooded hillside. By {{the end of}} April 1942, most of the {{companies}} of the 4th Krajina National Liberation Partisan Detachment had joined the Chetnik side or disintegrated. Rade Radić became {{the commander of the}} Chetnik detachments in Bosanska Krajina. After the war, Radić was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of Yugoslavia; he was executed by firing squad in 1945. Stojanović's remains were exhumed and reburied at Prijedor in November 1961.|$|E
5|$|The Australians were {{crossing}} a creek {{that was in}} front of <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> hill. The Japanese commander waited until the Australians were almost at his position before opening fire with machine guns and mortars. The troops who had crossed the creek found hand grenades were being rolled down the hill at them; those behind it were pinned down by heavy and accurate fire. Arnold decided to pull back. That night, he formed a defensive position, and beat off a small Japanese attack.|$|E
5000|$|A raised beach, marine terrace, coastal terrace, or perched {{coastline}} is {{a relatively}} flat, horizontal or gently inclined surface of marine origin, mostly an old abrasion platform which has been lifted out of the sphere of wave activity (sometimes called [...] "tread"). Thus, it lies above or under the current sea level, depending {{on the time of}} its formation. It is bounded by <b>a</b> <b>steeper</b> ascending slope on the landward side and <b>a</b> <b>steeper</b> descending slope on the seaward side (sometimes called [...] "riser"). Due to its generally flat shape it is often used for anthropogenic structures such as settlements and infrastructure.|$|R
