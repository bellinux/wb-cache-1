Despite his concerns about Nixon as vice president, Hand voted for Dwight Eisenhower in the 1952 election, later crediting Eisenhower with bringing about McCarthy's downfall in 1954.|$|E
5|$|On November 26, 1861, Governor Johnson issued <b>an</b> <b>address</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{citizens}} of the Commonwealth blaming abolitionists for {{the breakup of the}} United States. He asserted his belief that the Union and Confederacy were forces of equal strength, and that the only solution to the war was a free trade agreement between the two sovereign nations. He further announced his willingness to resign as provisional governor if the Kentucky General Assembly would agree to cooperate with Governor Magoffin. Magoffin himself denounced the Russellville Convention and the provisional government, stressing the need to abide by the will {{of the majority of the}} Commonwealth's citizens.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{position}} that the Baltic states had been forcibly annexed would remain its official stance for the following 51 years.

5|$|Alarmed, the American {{ambassador}} to Brazil sent a cablegram to his Department of State in September 1906, warning {{them of the}} destabilization that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race. At the same time, the American government under Theodore Roosevelt tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco remarking that caving to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as suzerain Cuba. The President of Brazil, Afonso Pena, supported the naval acquisitions in <b>an</b> <b>address</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated and obsolete vessels of the current navy.|$|E
5|$|For most of Scott's {{tenure as}} governor, {{tensions}} between the U.S. and Great Britain escalated. Sentiment {{in favor of a}} U.S. declaration of war against the British was particularly strong in Kentucky. Most Kentuckians resented the replacement of the Embargo Act of 1807 with the weaker Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 and Macon's Bill Number 2. Kentucky Senator Henry Clay became the acknowledged leader of the war hawks in Congress. During <b>an</b> <b>address</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly on December 4, 1810, Scott expressed little hope of peacefully resolving U.S. grievances against Great Britain. He reminded the General Assembly, however, that France had also violated the United States' maritime rights and urged equal treatment of the two countries for their offenses.|$|E
5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} <b>an</b> <b>address</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> National Science Teachers Association, {{in which}} he suggested how students {{could be made to}} think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate ab initio, from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.|$|E

5|$|Independence Day is {{annually}} {{celebrated on}} 15 August, {{as a national}} holiday in India commemorating the nation's independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, the UK Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act 1947 transferring legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent Assembly. India still retained King George VI as head of state until its transition to full republican constitution. India attained independence following the Independence Movement noted for largely nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience led by the Indian National Congress (INC). Independence coincided with the partition of India, in which the British India was divided along religious lines into the Dominions of India and Pakistan; the partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties, and the displacement of nearly 15 million people due to religious violence. On 15 August 1947, the Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru raised the Indian national flag above the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi. On each subsequent Independence Day, the prime minister customarily raises the flag and gives <b>an</b> <b>address</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nation.|$|E
5|$|Inside the apartment, Mulder's {{search for}} clues is {{interrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} The Smoking Man, who tells Mulder that he has been betrayed by Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), who is actually his son. The Smoking Man tells Mulder that, many years ago, the Syndicate agreed by majority vote, against Bill Mulder's objections, to align with the alien colonists to be spared during colonization. The Syndicate was forced to give up family members to the colonists as collateral so that an alien fetus could be given to the Syndicate {{in order for them to}} gain access to alien DNA. Since Bill Mulder was slow to agree, Samantha Mulder was not taken until after the others. Using the fetus, the Syndicate worked on creating alien-human hybrids who could survive colonization. The Smoking Man tells Mulder that colonization will begin once Cassandra is handed over and that Mulder will be able to see his sister again, providing him with <b>an</b> <b>address</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hangar where the Syndicate members will be meeting the colonists.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1909 that an Apatosaurus skull was found during the first expedition, led by Earl Douglass, to what would {{become known as the}} Carnegie Quarry at Dinosaur National Monument. The skull was found a short {{distance}} from a skeleton (specimen CM3018) identified as the new species Apatosaurus louisae, named after Louise Carnegie, wife of Andrew Carnegie, who funded field research to find complete dinosaur skeletons in the American West. The skull was designated CM11162; it was very similar to the skull of Diplodocus. Another smaller skeleton of A.louisae was found nearby CM11162 and CM3018. The skull was accepted as belonging to the Apatosaurus specimen by Douglass and Carnegie Museum director William H. Holland, although other scientistsmost notably Osbornrejected this identification. Holland defended his view in 1914 in <b>an</b> <b>address</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Paleontological Society of America, yet he left the Carnegie Museum mount headless. While some thought Holland was attempting to avoid conflict with Osborn, others suspected Holland was waiting until an articulated skull and neck were found to confirm the association of the skull and skeleton. After Holland's death in 1934, museum staff placed a cast of a Camarasaurus skull on the mount.|$|E
