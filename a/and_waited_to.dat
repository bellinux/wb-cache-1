5|$|The first {{talks between}} Przemysł II and Mestwin II about the latter's {{succession}} probably occurred around 1281, on {{occasion of the}} arrival of the Duke of Pomerelia in Greater Poland to visit the Benedictine Abbey in Lubin. Although there is no direct evidence that Przemysł II was also in the Abbey in person, the presence of Jan I of Wysokowce, Bishop of Poznań and other Greater Poland dignitaries suggest that a compromise was then suggested. At the beginning of the next year Mestwin II again went to southern Greater Poland, in order to talk with the Papal legate Filippo di Fermo about his dispute with the Teutonic Order over the possession of the towns of Gniew and Białogard. The legate stayed in Milicz, which belonged to the Diocese of Wrocław. Due to the friendly relations of Przemysł II (and thus his ally Mestwin II) with Henry IV Probus, the Duke of Pomerania decided to stop at the frontier village of Kępno (also in the Diocese of Wrocław), <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>to</b> hear the legate's verdict.|$|E
25|$|When Ritchie {{passed the}} first MiG-21, he {{recalled}} the engagement of May 10 <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>to</b> {{see if there was}} a trailing MiG. When he observed the second MiG, which he also passed headon, he reversed hard left to engage. The Mig turned to its right to evade the attack, an unusual maneuver, and Ritchie used a vertical separation move to gain position on its rear quarter. DeBellevue obtained a solid boresight (dogfighting radar lock) on it while at the MiG's 5 o'clock; although fired from the edge of their flight envelopes, both AIM-7s struck home.|$|E
25|$|Alan Pert, {{one of her}} biographers, {{wrote that}} Kingsford was caught in torrential rain in Paris in November 1886 {{on her way to}} the {{laboratory}} of Louis Pasteur, one of the most prominent vivisectionists of the period. She reportedly spent hours in wet clothing and developed pneumonia, then pulmonary tuberculosis. She travelled to the Riviera and Italy, sometimes with Maitland, at other times with her husband, hoping in vain that a different climate would help her recover. In July 1887, she settled in London in a house she and her husband rented at 15 Wynnstay Gardens, Kensington, <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>to</b> die, although she remained mentally active.|$|E

During the argument Gaston breaks the mirror. When Belle sees the broken glass she notices Gaston's eyes glowing red. That, combined with several fresh wounds on the ogre, reveals that Gaston had tortured the ogre in order to provoke the creature so they would have reason to kill it. Belle lets the ogre escape.|$|E
25|$|Saladin's {{intelligence}} services reported {{to him that}} the Crusaders were planning a raid into Syria. He ordered one of his generals, Farrukh-Shah, to guard the Damascus frontier with a thousand of his men to watch for an attack, then to retire, avoiding battle, and to light warning beacons on the hills, after which Saladin would march out. In April 1179, the Crusaders led by King Baldwin expected no resistance <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>to</b> launch a surprise attack on Muslim herders grazing their herds and flocks east of the Golan Heights. Baldwin advanced too rashly in pursuit of Farrukh-Shah's force, which was concentrated southeast of Quneitra and was subsequently defeated by the Ayyubids. With this victory, Saladin decided to call in more troops from Egypt; he requested al-Adil to dispatch 1,500 horsemen.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, Cambridge {{has placed}} {{slightly}} more emphasis than Oxford on public exam results during the selection process. Cambridge routinely asks applicants who take A-level exams {{to report their}} exact scores, not just letter-grades; this is partly to distinguish between high A-grades and borderline A/B grades. In contrast, disclosure of exact scores for Oxford applications is voluntary. In 2010, the new A* grade for A-level exams (an A* indicating a high A) was introduced. Cambridge started requesting that its applicants achieve at least one A* grade if they were taking A-levels, letting students earn a place through their performance in public examinations; Oxford initially stated that it relies more on its own internal aptitude tests <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>to</b> see how effective the A* grade is at highlighting the best candidates, before deciding to implement it as a requirement for most courses starting in 2012.|$|E

25|$|Franklin's party reached Fort Enterprise on 12 October 1821, {{two days}} after Back. They found it deserted and unstocked. The promised {{supplies}} of dried meat had not appeared, {{and there was nothing}} to eat except bones from the previous winter, a few rotting skins which had been used as bedding, and a little tripe de roche. A note from Back explained that he had found the fort in this state, and that he was heading towards Fort Providence to look for Akaitcho and his first nation members. The party despaired. Two voyageurs, Augustus and Benoit, set off upriver in the hope of meeting some first nation people. The rest of the group remained, too weak to go any further. Two of the voyageurs lay down crying <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>to</b> die, and even the normally optimistic Franklin wrote of how quickly his strength was evaporating. None of them had eaten meat for four weeks.|$|E
25|$|Peter {{gathered}} his army at Cologne on 12 April 1096, planning to stop there and preach to the Germans and gather more crusaders. The French, however, were {{not willing to}} wait for Peter and the Germans and {{under the leadership of}} Walter Sans Avoir, a few thousand French crusaders left before Peter and reached Hungary on 8 May, passing through Hungary without incident and arriving at the river Sava at the border of Byzantine territory at Belgrade. The Belgrade commander was taken by surprise, having no orders on what to do with them, and refused entry, forcing the crusaders to pillage the countryside for food. This resulted in skirmishes with the Belgrade garrison and, to make matters worse, sixteen of Walter's men had tried to rob a market in Zemun across the river in Hungary and were stripped of their armor and clothing, which was hung from the castle walls. Eventually the crusaders were allowed to carry on to Niš, where they were provided with food <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>to</b> hear from Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|In early 1974, a National Geographic {{film crew}} {{went to the}} island, in what {{was one of the}} most {{unsuccessful}} expeditions made on the island. North Sentinel was visited by a team of anthropologists filming a documentary, Man in Search of Man. The team was accompanied by armed police officers and a National Geographic photographer. When the motorised boat broke through the barrier reefs, locals emerged from the jungle. The Sentinelese responded with a curtain of arrows. The boat landed at a point on the coast out of range of the arrows and the police (dressed in jackets with padded armour) landed and left gifts in the sand: a miniature plastic car, some coconuts, a live pig tied, a doll, and aluminium cookware. The policemen returned to the boat <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>to</b> see the locals' reaction to the gifts. The reaction was to launch another round of arrows, one of which struck the documentary's director in the left thigh. The man who wounded the director withdrew and laughed proudly, sitting in the shade while others speared, then buried, the pig and the doll. Afterwards, everyone left, taking with them only the coconuts and aluminium cookware.|$|E

500|$|In February 1927, an {{agreement}} {{was signed by}} five leading Hollywood movie companies: [...] Famous Players-Lasky (soon {{to be part of}} Paramount), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal, First National, and Cecil B. DeMille's small but prestigious Producers Distributing Corporation (PDC). The five studios agreed to collectively select just one provider for sound conversion. The alliance then sat back <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>to</b> see what sort of results the forerunners came up with. In May, Warner Bros. sold back its exclusivity rights to ERPI (along with the Fox-Case sublicense) and signed a new royalty contract similar to Fox's for use of Western Electric technology.

500|$|By September 2015, John Paesano {{had begun}} {{composing}} {{music for the}} season. He felt that the season's new showrunners [...] "were true to {{what we were trying}} to do in season one. There were just elements in season two that we had to acknowledge" [...] such as the Punisher and Elektra. He jokingly said that [...] "it’s not like we all of the sudden went into John Williams territory, you know? It’s definitely still dark, still gritty ... but it definitely jumps up a couple levels." [...] When approaching the characters of Punisher and Elektra, with whom Paesano was familiar from the comics and previous adaptations, he [...] "took all those preconceived notions I had with a grain of salt" [...] <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>to</b> see what the season's interpretation of the characters would be. Paesano worked closely with the series' sound design team, spotting episodes with them to coordinate where [...] "we were going to hit what" [...] and [...] "maintain that definable aspect of New York" [...] and its sound. A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by Hollywood Records on July 15, 2016.|$|E

500|$|Rossen filmed The Hustler {{over six}} weeks, entirely in New York City. Much {{of the action}} was filmed at two now-defunct pool halls, McGirr's and Ames Billiard Academy. Other {{shooting}} locations included a townhouse on East 82nd Street, which served as the Louisville home of Murray Hamilton's character Findley, and the Manhattan Greyhound bus terminal. The film crew built a dining area that was so realistic that confused passengers sat there <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>to</b> place their orders. Willie Mosconi served as technical advisor on the film and shot {{a number of the}} trick shots in place of the actors. All of Gleason's shots were his own; they were filmed in wide-angle to emphasize having the actor and the shot in the same frames. Rossen, in pursuit of the style he termed [...] "neo-neo-realistic", hired actual street thugs, enrolled them in the Screen Actors Guild and used them as extras. Scenes that were included in the shooting script but did not make it into the final film include a scene at Ames pool hall establishing that Eddie {{is on his way to}} town (originally slated to be the first scene of the film) and a longer scene of Preacher talking to Bert at Johnny's Bar which establishes Preacher is a junkie.|$|E
2500|$|Sturgis was on {{detached}} duty at St. Louis, Missouri when {{parts of}} the 7th Cavalry were destroyed at the Battle of Little Big Horn. (One of Sturgis's sons, Second Lieutenant James G. Sturgis, was also an officer with the 7th and was killed in that battle.) Samuel Sturgis then took personal command of the regiment and led the 7th Cavalry in the campaign against the Nez Percé in 1877. Sturgis and his soldiers headed off the Nez Percé <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>to</b> attack them after when they emerged from their passage through the wilderness of Yellowstone Park.

2500|$|After {{several weeks}} of repair, Enterprise sortied to oppose an Imperial Japanese battle fleet that was {{threatening}} the Solomon Islands. The Japanese convoy included eleven transports with over seven thousand soldiers headed down the [...] "Slot" [...] to Guadalcanal to retake Henderson Field. On November 14, 1942, Feightner protected U.S. dive bombers and strafed enemy vessels during the strikes that destroyed seven of the troop carriersa significant event in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. After the attacks, VF-10 remained at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal to reinforce the 1st Marine Division {{and deal with the}} Japanese ships and troops from the remaining transports that had intentionally beached themselves. Conditions on the island were primitive and dangerous for pilots of the Cactus Air Force. Many of the service men came down with malaria. Japanese soldiers hid in trees <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>to</b> ambush the Americans. Sleep was disrupted by night bombardment. Fortunately, Feightner had to endure the hazardous conditions on Guadalcanal less than a week, as VF-10 left their old aircraft at Henderson Field and returned to Enterprise on November 25, 1942, where they received new F4Fs.|$|E

2500|$|Kelly {{served in}} the First World War: on 4 August 1914 he was assigned, as {{commanding}} officer of HMS Dublin, by Sir Berkeley Milne to shadow the German squadron under Rear-Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, consisting of the cruiser SMS Breslau and the battlecruiser SMS Goeben. Kelly did so, but eventually {{lost sight of the}} German ships. Kelly's younger brother Howard, commanding the cruiser HMS Gloucester, also became involved in the subsequent chase. [...] HMS Dublin re-encountered the Germans at 1.30 a.m. on 6 August 1914 while sailing to join Rear-Admiral Ernest Troubridge's squadron, and passed news of the sighting to his brother and to Troubridge, before losing them again. Howard Kelly continued to shadow the Germans, and at 8.30 p.m. Milne ordered HMS Dublin, sailing in company with two destroyers, to launch a torpedo attack that night. Using the reports from HMS Gloucester of the Germans' speed and course, HMS Dublin and the destroyers took up position on the Germans' bow, <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>to</b> intercept them. They hoped to make contact at 3.30 a.m. on the morning of 7 August 1914, but the British had been spotted by SMS Breslau, which warned SMS Goeben. The Germans passed unseen to starboard.|$|E
2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>to</b> hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window.

I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 2, the Marines {{made some}} minor headway {{and brought in}} further reinforcements. The 1st Battalion finally {{relieved}} the MACV radio facility that morning. LtCol Gravel launched a two-company assault supported by tanks towards the provincial headquarters (...) and Thua Thien prison, 7 blocks west of the MACV Compound where the ARVN were believed to still be holding out. The Marines did not progress further than one block before their advance was halted and after 3 hours of room to room fighting, the Marines captured the Huế University building {{at the base of}} the Trường Tiền Bridge 2 blocks northwest of the MACV Compound so reducing enemy fire towards the LCU Ramp. The Marines then tried to assault the Treasury building (...) in the next block, but were stopped by fire from the 100 plus PAVN defenders and flanking fire from the Le Loi Elementary School. The battalion consolidated its night defensive positions <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>to</b> renew its attack on the following day. About 11:00, Company H, 2/5 Marines, crossed the An Cuu Bridge in a 'Rough Rider' armed convoy. As the convoy, accompanied by Army trucks equipped with quad [...]50 machine guns and two M50 Ontos, entered the city, enemy snipers opened up on the Marine reinforcements. Near the MACV compound, the Marines came under heavy enemy machine gun and rocket fire. The Army gunners and the Marine Ontos, quickly responded, in the resulting confusion, the convoy exchanged fire with a Marine unit already in the city. About mid-day, the PAVN, continued to block any advance to the south. An enemy 75mm recoilless rifle knocked out one of the supporting tanks. By the end of the day, the Marines had sustained 2 dead and 34 wounded and claimed to have killed nearly 140 of the enemy. That night the PAVN overran the ARVN defenders at the Thua Thien prison releasing the prisoners, many of whom were VC who were soon armed with captured ARVN weapons and joined the fighting.|$|E
