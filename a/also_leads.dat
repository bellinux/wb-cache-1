5|$|Durkheim saw the {{population}} density and growth as key {{factors in the}} evolution of the societies and advent of modernity. As the number of people in a given area increase, so does the number of interactions, and the society becomes more complex. Growing competition between the more numerous people <b>also</b> <b>leads</b> to further division of labour. In time, the importance of the state, the law and the individual increases, while that of the religion and moral solidarity decreases.|$|E

5|$|Of this list's 46 pitchers, {{the best}} win–loss record, {{in terms of}} winning percentage, is shared by three pitchers: Bobby Locke, who won one game in three seasons (19621964) with the Phillies; Kyle Lohse, who went 30 in 2007; and Marcelino López, who posted a 10 record during the 1963 season. Jim Lonborg's 75 {{victories}} and 60 defeats are tops in both of those statistical categories, and he <b>also</b> <b>leads</b> in strikeouts, with 551 in 7 seasons.

Ricci's 1.80 earned run average (ERA) is the lowest among this list's pitchers; one position player, second baseman Cookie Rojas, has a 0.00 ERA in his only pitching appearance.|$|E
5|$|Protease {{inhibition}} by serpins controls {{an array}} of biological processes, including coagulation and inflammation, and consequently these proteins are the target of medical research. Their unique conformational change also makes them {{of interest to the}} structural biology and protein folding research communities. The conformational-change mechanism confers certain advantages, but it also has drawbacks: serpins are vulnerable to mutations that can result in serpinopathies such as protein misfolding and the formation of inactive long-chain polymers. Serpin polymerisation not only reduces the amount of active inhibitor, but <b>also</b> <b>leads</b> to accumulation of the polymers, causing cell death and organ failure.|$|E

5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey {{by living}} {{out of sight of}} predators, whether in caves, underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it <b>also</b> <b>leads</b> to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.|$|E

Though never made into a chapter, Nate and Elena attempt to sneak into an airship to get to an island in search of El Dorado, but the area was infested by Navarro's mercenaries. After killing them, Navarro appears in an armored truck and begins firing at them with a chaingun. Nate knocks a telephone pole on his truck using explosive barrels, and escapes on the plane with Elena. Sometime later, he and Roman travel to the island so Roman can sell El Dorado {{for a lot of}} money that Sully owes him (who they took with them when Nate thought he was dead), unaware that Navarro has his own plan of selling it. Eventually, they team up with Eddy Raja, who is also searching for statue of El Dorado, and try to keep Nate away from it.|$|E
5|$|Dorset {{is one of}} the few {{counties}} in England not to have a motorway. The A303, A35 and A31 trunk roads run through the county. The A303, which connects the West Country to London via the M3, clips the north-west of the county. The A35 crosses the county in a west-east direction from Honiton in Devon, via Bridport, Dorchester, Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch, to Southampton in Hampshire. The A31 connects to the A35 at Bere Regis, and passes east through Wimborne and Ferndown to Hampshire, where it later becomes the M27. Other main roads in the county include the A338, A354, A37 and A350. The A338 heads north from Bournemouth to Ringwood (Hampshire) and on to Salisbury (Wiltshire) and beyond. The A354 also connects to Salisbury after travelling north-east from Weymouth in the south of the county. The A37 travels north-west from Dorchester to Yeovil in Somerset. The A350 <b>also</b> <b>leads</b> north, from Poole through Blandford and Shaftesbury, to Warminster in Wiltshire.|$|E

5|$|The {{honor of}} {{becoming}} an altar server, was, in the past, a privilege only available to boys but has since become coed. Altar servers wear long, white, plain robes and assist the priest in his duties during the Mass. At Mt. St. Peter Church, there are four altar servers at every Mass. One is the book bearer and {{is in charge of}} bringing the Bible to the priest at the times during which the priest reads from the Bible during the Mass. The cross bearer holds a large, wooded crucifix and commences the procession in which the priest enters the church. Also present in the procession are the acolytes, and the book bearer. He or she <b>also</b> <b>leads</b> the procession out of the church {{at the end of the}} Mass. The last two altar servers are acolytes and are in charge of lighting the candles in the church prior to the beginning of the Mass and extinguishing them after Mass.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} red maple, {{especially}} when dead or wilted, are extremely toxic to horses. The toxin is unknown, but {{believed to be}} an oxidant because it damages red blood cells, causing acute oxidative hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but <b>also</b> <b>leads</b> {{to the production of}} methemoglobin, which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, colic, laminitis, coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as blood transfusions, fluid support, diuretics, and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.|$|E

5|$|Clara and Merry flee {{back to the}} {{ceremony}} and the Doctor faces the creature, realising it feeds off memories, stories, and feelings. He tries to overfeed it by offering {{the sum total of}} his Time Lord memories; Merry <b>also</b> <b>leads</b> the citizens in a song of hope, confusing Akhaten who then disappears. However, the Doctor's memories are not enough to sate the creature and Akhaten reappears. Clara returns to help, offering Akhaten the leaf that blew into her father's face on the day he met her mother, which contains an infinite amount of untold potential that Clara's mother never saw because she died early. Akhaten, overwhelmed by the infinite potential it has consumed, implodes on itself and the Rings are saved. The Doctor returns Clara to her home on the same day they left and gives her back her mother's ring, telling her that all the creatures she saved wanted her to have it back. Suddenly Clara remembers seeing the Doctor at her mother's funeral and asks why he was there. He tells her that she reminds him of someone who died and she rebukes him for using her as a replacement, but he assures her she is not a replacement and Clara leaves. However, the moment she is gone, the Doctor's expression becomes grim and closes the TARDIS door from which Clara left.|$|E
5|$|Major {{cities and}} {{regional}} rivalry {{played an important}} role in the wars. The disappearance of a central, imperial authority—and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata)—initiated a prolonged period of balkanization in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units which should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first, to a sense of being Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a sense of belonging to the major cities or local province, the patria in Spanish. More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry <b>also</b> <b>leads</b> some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with Río de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.|$|E
