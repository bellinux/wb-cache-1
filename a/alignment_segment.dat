40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a {{nonlinear}} control has been de-signed using the dynamic inversion approach for automatic landing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), along with associ-ated path planning. This {{is a difficult}} problem because of light weight of UAVs and strong coupling between longitudinal and lateral modes. The landing maneuver of the UAV is divided into approach, glideslope and flare. In the approach UAV aligns with the centerline of the runway by heading angle correction. In glideslope and flare the UAV follows straight line and exponential curves respectively in the pitch plane with no lateral deviations. The glideslope and flare path are scheduled {{as a function of}} approach distance from runway. The trajectory parameters are calculated such that the sink rate at touchdown remains within specified bounds. It is also ensured that the transition from the glideslope to flare path is smooth by ensuring C 1 continuity at the transition. In the outer loop, the roll rate command is generated by assuring a co-ordinated turn in the <b>alignment</b> <b>segment</b> and by assuring zero bank angle in the glideslope and flare segments. The pitch rate command is generated from the error in altitude to control the deviations from the landing trajectory. The yaw rate command is generated from the required heading correction. In the inner loop, the aileron, elevator and rudder deflections are computed together to track the required body rate commands. Moreover, it is also ensured that the forward velocity of the UAV at the touch down remains close to a desired value by manipulating the thrust of the vehicle. A nonlinear six-DOF model, which has been developed from extensive wind-tunnel testing, is used both for control design as well as to validate it. I...|$|E

The definitions of crash rates in terms of <b>segment</b> <b>alignment</b> and location are presented respectively. The study gathers crash data and the roadway geometric information of rural two-lane highways in southwest of China and crash rates of each segment type are proposed by utilizing the proposed definitions.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the results of}} a series of simulation studies of beam-based alignment of the NLC main linacs using the program LIAR. Three algorithms for alignment of quadrupoles and girders are consid-ered: the algorithm used in the ZDR, the ZDR algorithm combined with a post-alignment MICADO operation, and an algorithm which requires no steering dipoles but requires twice as many <b>alignment</b> <b>segments</b> per linac as the ZDR algorithm. The third algorithm appears to be the most robust, based on convergence time, required quad mover step sizes, and variation in extracted beam emittance as a function of BNS profile. We also study the effect of structure BPM resolution and ATL misalignments during the alignment process. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of comparative modeling approaches for protein structure prediction can be substantially improved by incorporating predicted structural {{information in the}} initial sequence-structure alignment. Motivated by the approaches used to align protein structures, this paper focuses on developing machine learning approaches for estimating the RMSD value {{of a pair of}} protein fragments. These estimated fragment-level RMSD values can be used to construct the alignment, assess the quality of an alignment, and identify highquality <b>alignment</b> <b>segments.</b> We present algorithms to solve this fragment-level RMSD prediction problem using a supervised learning framework based on support vector regression and classification that incorporates protein profiles, predicted secondary structure, effective information encoding schemes, and novel second-order pairwise exponential kernel functions. Our comprehensive empirical study shows superior results compared to the profile-toprofile scoring schemes...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{automatic}} data <b>alignment</b> model called <b>segmented</b> <b>alignment.</b> The conventional data alignment model, {{such as that}} used in High-Performance Fortran (HPF), aligns arrays with the whole index domain. The principle of our proposed <b>segmented</b> <b>alignment</b> is to allow alignment relations within delimited index domains. We first provide motivating examples to illustrate how code fragments of HPF with EOSHIFT or CSHIFT operations or produced by synthesis operations can benefit from our enhanced alignment scheme. Second, we show that this new model can be implemented in HPF-like languages by adding WHEN and IN constructs to them. In addition, we show that the new proposed schemes for WHEN and IN constructs can be emulated using standard HPF syntax. Finally, we address issues related to automatic data alignment for the new proposed model, and present an algorithm to automatically align programs using our <b>segmented</b> <b>alignment</b> scheme. Since the optimal algorithm {{to do this is}} NP-hard, a practical heuristic is also given. Our experiments were performed on a DEC Alpha Farm with HPF environments. Our experiments confirm our theory that our proposed alignment scheme can significantly enhance not only the performance of HPF code fragments with EOSHIFT or CSHIFT operations, but also that of codes produced by synthesis operations...|$|R

40|$|Motivation: In {{comparative}} genomics, phylogenetic shadowing is {{the procedure}} of highlighting <b>alignment</b> <b>segments</b> exhibiting unusual rates of sequence evolution, presumably due to purifying selection or adaptation. Phylogenetic shadowing {{has been extremely}} useful in delineating putative functional elements in the human genome, by juxtaposition with other primate and mammalian genomes. Results: We describe a probabilistic framework for phylogenetic shadowing in which likelihood scores are combined with a complexity penalty to restrict the false positive identification of unusual rate variation. The framework gives more flexibility in controlling sensitivity than Hidden Markov Models do. We also discuss theoretical and statistical considerations that ensure reasonable practices in choosing model parameters. Our study concentrates {{on the case of}} phylogenetic shadowing for a three-wise alignment. The techniques are illustrated by the example of a human-chimpanzee-baboon alignment in which we identify previously unannotated regions displaying unusual conservation or human-specific divergence.

The W. M. Keck Ten Meter Telescope will utilize a primary mirror made up of 36 actively controlled segments. Thus the primary mirror and its <b>segment</b> <b>alignment</b> control system are directly analogous to the LDR. The problems of controlling the segments in the face of disturbances and control/structures interaction, as analyzed for the TMT, are virtually identical to those for the LDR. The two systems are briefly compared...|$|R

Using this ray-trace and diffraction model we have simulated the TMT optical errors related to multiple effects including <b>segment</b> <b>alignment</b> and phasing, <b>segment</b> surface figures, temperature, and gravity. We have then modeled the effects of each TMT optical error in terms of the Point Source Sensitivity (a multiplicative image plane metric) for a seeing limited case and an adaptive optics corrected case (for the NFIRAOS).

40|$|People, when {{processing}} human-to-human communication, utilize {{everything they}} can {{in order to understand}} that communication, including speech and information such as the time and location of an interlocutor’s gesture and gaze. Speech and gesture are known to exhibit a synchronous relationship in human communication; however, the precise nature of that relationship requires further investigation. The construction of computer models of multimodal human communication would be enabled by the availability of multimodal communication corpora annotated with synchronized gesture and speech features. To investigate the temporal relationships of these knowledge sources, we have collected and are annotating several multimodal corpora with time-aligned features. Forced alignment between a speech file and its transcription is a crucial part of multimodal corpus production. This paper investigates a number of factors that may contribute to highly accurate forced alignments to support the rapid production of these multimodal corpora including the acoustic model, the match between the speech used for training the system and that to be force aligned, the amount of data used to train the ASR system, the availability of speaker adaptation, and the duration of <b>alignment</b> <b>segments.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|Domains are {{the basic}} {{evolutionary}} units of proteins, and numerous proteins contain more than one domain. Therefore, a multiple sequence alignment tool that can value the importance of domain should be useful when working on multi-domain proteins. DOBALI, a domainbased multiple sequence alignment tool is proposed here. DOBALI consists of two major steps: Domain <b>alignment</b> and <b>Segment</b> <b>alignment.</b> The “domain architectures ” of proteins are assigned and their shortest common supersequence is obtained in the first step. The segments from same domain types are aligned {{by one of the}} multiple sequence alignment methods incorporated in DOBALI in the second step. Therefore, DOBALI {{can be viewed as a}} MSA-preprocessing tool: it cuts sequences into segments according to domain boundaries, and tries to outline the final alignment based on the alignment of domains. The analysis of some glycosyl hydrolases indicated that the alignments obtained from DOBALI could provide better or similar results for those without preprocessing. ...|$|R

40|$|The Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) is a fixed-elevation, 9. 2 -m {{telescope}} with a spherical {{primary mirror}} and a tracker at prime focus to follow astronomical objects. The telescope was constructed for $ 13. 9 M {{over the period}} 1994 - 1997. A number of telescope performance deficiencies were identified and corrected following construction. Remaining problems included: 1) Dome seeing, 2) inadequate initial mirror <b>segment</b> <b>alignment</b> accuracy, and 3) mirror segment misalignment with time. The HET Completion Project was created in May 2001 to attack these problems and to identify and solve the next tier of problems. To address dome seeing, large louvers were installed and in operation by May 2002. Efforts are also underway to eliminate or suppress heat sources within the dome environment. To address <b>segment</b> <b>alignment</b> accuracy, a prototype Shack-Hartmann device, the Mirror Alignment Recovery System (MARS), was built and is in routine use at HET. The <b>Segment</b> <b>Alignment</b> Maintenance System (SAMS) is in early operation and has markedly improved telescope performance.

As these improvements have been implemented, telescope image quality has improved significantly. Plans are in place to address additional performance issues...|$|R
40|$|Profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs) and {{probabilistic}} inference methods have made important {{contributions to the}} theory of sequence database homology search. However, practical use of profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the "multiple segment Viterbi" (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local <b>alignment</b> <b>segments</b> using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20 -fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call "sparse rescaling". These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available HMMER 3 software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER 3 is substantially more sensitive and 100 - to 1000 -fold faster than HMMER 2. HMMER 3 is now about as fast as BLAST for protein searches...|$|R

40|$|Outer {{membrane}} proteins (OMPs) are transmembrane proteins (TMPs) {{located in}} outer membranes. These proteins perform diverse biochemical functions and have immediate medical relevance, {{so that their}} spatial structures are important for studying. But the special physicochemical properties of OMP {{make it hard to}} obtain their structures experimentally. For the purpose of predicting OMP structures, discriminating OMPs and aligning their sequences to native structures are indispensable steps. We developed a novel method OMSA (Outer Membrane <b>Segment</b> <b>Alignment),</b> which implemented both steps in one program. OMSA integrates OMP-specific topology features to implement a sequence-to-structure <b>alignment,</b> for example, <b>segment</b> type and segment orientation, while a segment-dependent gap penalty model is employed to improve the alignment. Compared to peer top-leading methods, OMSA achieved higher accuracy in both OMP discrimination and alignment, which may further improve OMP structure studying...|$|R
