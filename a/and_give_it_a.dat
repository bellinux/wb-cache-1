5|$|A widely {{consumed}} liquor among Palestinian Christians, non-religious Palestinians {{and many}} less-stringently observant Muslims is Arak. Arak {{is a clear}} anise-flavored alcoholic drink that is mixed with water to soften it <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> creamy white color. It is consumed during special occasions such as holidays, weddings, and gatherings or with the mezze. Beer is also a consumed drink and the Palestinian town of Taybeh in the central West Bank contains {{one of the few}} breweries in Palestine. In addition to regular beer, the brewery produces non-alcoholic beer for observant Muslims. The nearby town of Birzeit is also home to Shepherds Brewery.|$|E
5|$|This sturdily built {{antelope}} has {{a yellow}} to grayish brown coat. Generally, the bohor reedbuck is yellower than other reedbucks. The large and diffuse sebaceous glands {{present on the}} coat make the coat greasy <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> strong odour. Juveniles are darker than the adults as well as long-haired. While R. r. bohor appears yellowish gray, R. r. wardi is richly tinted. The undersides are white in color. A few distinct markings can be observed—such as a dark stripe {{on the front of}} each foreleg; white markings under the tail; and a pale ring of hair around the eyes and along the lips, lower jaw, and upper throat. However, R. r. redunca lacks dark stripes on its forelegs. The males have thicker necks. Its large, oval-shaped ears distinguish it from other antelopes. There is a round bare spot below each ear. Apart from sebaceous glands, bohor reedbuck have a pair of inguinal glands and vestigial foot glands, and four nipples. A bohor reedbuck can survive for at least ten years. The tracks of the bohor reedbuck are slightly smaller than those of the southern reedbuck.|$|E

25|$|This {{species is}} {{particularly}} revered {{in the traditional}} religion of the Igbo people of southeastern Nigeria. It is considered symbolic of the earth, being an animal that travels {{so close to the}} ground. Even among many Christian Igbos, these pythons are treated with great care whenever they happen to wander into a village or onto someone's property; they are allowed to roam freely or are very gently picked up and placed out in a forest or field away from any homes. If one is accidentally killed, many communities in Igboland still build a coffin for the snake's remains <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> short funeral.|$|E
25|$|Darden {{would use}} a number of terms that he himself devised to {{describe}} how a quote, image, sketch, et cetera might influence a project. He would use the term pre-texts to describe passages that in-form the initial portion of the design process, but simultaneously cloaks and conceals the real intention. Con-texts are the writings by Darden or the inspirational elements that condition the design <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> sense of believability. Sub-text was the underlining story behind the project—in a sense, Darden's own personal life found in the project (e.g. Darden's letter to The Southern Quarterly on how he related Oxygen House with his leukemia). Finally, there are archi-texts, which are writings, thoughts, or ideas by Darden himself that color the project and give it sustenance.|$|E

25|$|The {{controller}} was a joint {{design by}} Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget and Hägglund, designated CMBK4. It {{was equipped with}} four cylinders. Those controlling the speed and braking were connected {{to each other and}} the controlled by the motorman by a wheel. The cylinders controlling the direction and disconnection of the motors were controlled by a lever. They were connected such that the main cylinder and the speed/braking cylinders had to be set to zero to disconnect the motors or change direction. The speed/braking controller had 24 levels. The reason for introducing a wheel was to allow the driver to man it with either hand <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> more ergonomic location, as the motormen's job was to a greater degree to manoeuver the tram in traffic rather than a more technical control of the vehicle. The trams were unidirectional, but to allow them to back there were controls {{at the back of the}} vehicles, hidden within a hatch. It had three buttions, controlling speed, braking and emergency braking.|$|E

It has its ballads; and everything comes from a very sincere, deeprooted place whether it's having fun or being vulnerable.|$|E

"On {{the night}} before such an event neither Mamma, Pappa, or Daughter Gale could get those minutes' solid sleep for thought {{that they might have}} {{overlooked}} some essential in the guests' comfort. At the first crow of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the larder into shape. So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie - the Gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie. First Mamma Gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state, <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> stir; then Pappa Gale would tiptoe over <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> stir; finally Daughter Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise. Then arrived the guests. The Minister and the Mrs. Minister, they were, and some neighbors. While she was receiving them the recollection came to Mamma Gale that the beloved mince pie had not received its flavoring. Off she speeds to a decanter of whiskey in the kitchen. She pours into the pie the right proportion of liquor, and goes back to her guests. Then Pappa Gale remembers that the pie has not been flavored. He, too, excuses himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred mince. No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than Daughter Gale, who has just remembered about the forgotten flavoring, rushes in and makes for the whiskey. She pours 'the right proportion' in, too." ...|$|E

In a 2011 interview, Gibbard stated, [...] "The name was never supposed {{to be something that}} someone was going to reference 15 years on.

[...] Although PALGN called the DMW system a [...] "handy tool", they also felt it was the game's weakest point. X-Play gave the game a 2/5, complaining about the unskippable cutscenes, poor dialogue, repetitive gameplay, and a weak plot. On April Fools' Day, in response to criticism for their original review, they [...] "decided to give the game a second look <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> re-review, {{this time with a}} clear unbiased perspective," [...] sarcastically dubbing over the original and giving it an impossibly high 6/5.|$|E

500|$|The {{experimental}} {{tendencies of}} hypnagogic pop artists like Pink and Ferraro were soon amplified by the Internet-centric genre known as vaporwave.

Critic Adam Harper identified several differences and similarities between hypnagogic pop and vaporwave; the two genres share an affinity for [...] "trash music", both are [...] "dreamy" [...] and [...] "chirpy", and both [...] "manipulate their material to defamiliarise it <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> sense of the uncanny, such as slowing it down and/or lowering the pitch, making it, as the term goes, ‘screwed’." [...] Of differences, vaporwave does not typically engage in long tracks, lo-fi productions, or non-sampled material, and it draws more from the early 1990s than it does the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
