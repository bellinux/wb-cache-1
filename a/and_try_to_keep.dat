5|$|At first, {{he is the}} {{lieutenant}} of Gabriel Roman, and helps him hold Sullivan and Drake hostage. He also leads a team of highly trained mercenaries hired by Roman. Though never made into a chapter, Nate and Elena attempt to sneak into an airship to get to an island in search of El Dorado, but the area was infested by Navarro's mercenaries. After killing them, Navarro appears in an armored truck and begins firing at them with a chaingun. Nate knocks a telephone pole on his truck using explosive barrels, and escapes on the plane with Elena. Sometime later, he and Roman travel to the island so Roman can sell El Dorado {{for a lot of}} money that Sully owes him (who they took with them when Nate thought he was dead), unaware that Navarro has his own plan of selling it. Eventually, they team up with Eddy Raja, who is also searching for statue of El Dorado, <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Nate away from it.|$|E
500|$|Morena Baccarin as Inara Serra– a Companion, {{which is}} the 26th century cross between a geisha and an escort or mistress, who rents one of Serenity's two small shuttles. Inara enjoys high social standing. Her {{presence}} confers a degree of legitimacy and social acceptance the crew of Serenity would not have without her on board. Inara displays great dignity, civility and compassion. There is strong romantic tension between her and Mal, who share many character traits, but each jokingly objects to the other's work as [...] "whoring" [...] or [...] "petty theft", respectively. Both refuse to act on their feelings <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their relationship professional.|$|E
500|$|Yoshimura wanted Braugher {{to treat}} D'Onofrio {{like he was}} [...] "bad luck" [...] <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his {{distance}} at first, but gradually come to view {{him as a person}} and form a close bond with him {{by the end of the}} episode. A New York City firefighter, Tim Brown, was a consultant for most of the technical information in the episode. In addition to helping Yoshimura with the dialogue from medical staff characters, Brown advised Yoshimura on the method of using air bags to push the subway train forward and remove Lange's body. Yoshimura included conflicting reports from witnesses about how the incident took place, which the writer described as a [...] "Rashomon thing", in reference to the 1950 Japanese film in which several characters offer differing descriptions of the same murder. [...] "Subway" [...] continued a sixth season trend in which the detectives became more personally involved with the victims, and thus becoming more emotionally drained at their deaths. For example, in the episode [...] "Birthday", which aired a month earlier, Falsone interviewed a victim who eventually died at the conclusion of the episode. It was the first television script Attanasio ever wrote.|$|E

500|$|United manager Ferguson also praised Dudek's {{performance}} in the match: [...] "Their goalkeeper has won them the game, sometimes {{you just have to}} put your hands up on these occasions. Dudek has won them the cup. He deserved to be man of the match. We didn't get a break. Dudek's performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box. In tough games like that the first goal is very important. It's a test for us. We can either accept defeat or we can fight back." [...] Captain Keane was disappointed with the defeat: [...] "The players, managers, staff are all upset but I suppose nowhere near as bad as the fans, if you don't win a match in football you feel as though you have let the fans down." [...] His focus turned to United's participation in the UEFA Champions League, as they looked to end the season with a trophy: [...] "It would have been nice {{to get a piece of}} silverware in the cabinet, especially with the opposition being Liverpool, we've just got to lick our wounds. We've got a game against Leeds on Wednesday and we'll get on with training for Wednesday. The players know we'll have to get together, get ready <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the pressure on Arsenal. But we are eight points behind them, which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning our hopes on the European Cup, which is a dangerous game to play as we saw last season." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the balance}} between {{creating}} new material and drawing from existing mythology, Bell noted that telling stories that can entertain both Marvel fans and non-Marvel fans is challenging, and that for the series they try to add nods to the MCU films or the comics {{in a way that}} works well on its own for all viewers, but could also mean more for a fan. On where the series can draw from the comics, Jed Whedon explained that there are areas of the comics that the series is not allowed to go to, and that ultimately they only use the comics for inspiration in generating their own story. Tancharoen elaborated that, [...] "We're always going to be inspired and influenced by the comics, but of course on the show, we'll always be doing our spin to it." [...] About comparisons between the scope of the series and that of the films, Bell said that ABC and Marvel had been very generous with the series' budget, and that the production could not complain for a network series, but that it was nothing compared to the films or even series like Game of Thrones. He explained that the series does attempt to create [...] "Marvel moments" [...] as best it can, but pointed out that some of the more memorable moments from the films are smaller, character moments—something that works really well on television—so the series strives for those when it cannot afford more scope and scale. Jed Whedon elaborated that they look at a sequence <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> only what is required to tell the story, so [...] "If a monster is landing on a car, instead of showing the whole monster leaping through the skyline, we {{want to be in the}} car with the character having that experience." ...|$|E
