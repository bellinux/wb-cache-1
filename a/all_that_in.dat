It starred Amanda Bynes, Drake Bell and Nancy Sullivan, and {{featured}} John Kassir, Raquel Lee, and Josh Peck.

25|$|Surrey Lions {{recorded}} {{their second}} win from two matches in Twenty20 Cup cricket this season, ironic given their {{position at the}} very bottom of the 45-over National League. Ali Brown made 64 and David Thornely 67 not out as Middlesex Crusaders conceded too many runs at the fine batting track at Lord's, Surrey making 200 for 3. Owais Shah notched up his second score in the 70s in two days, taking 78 from 44 balls, and things looked good despite Shah leaving at 148 for 2. But Tim Murtagh changed <b>all</b> <b>that.</b> <b>In</b> four overs, he took six for 24, {{and with the help of}} David Thornely (three for 22) he ensured that Middlesex had seven batsmen out in single figures. They were bowled out for 177, with three balls remaining in the innings.|$|E

25|$|In June 1867 Ismail was {{declared}} khedive of Egypt, with succession {{in favor of}} his eldest son. Nubar now had a harder task to undertake than ever before. The antiquated system of capitulations which had existed in the Ottoman Empire since the 15th century had grown in Egypt to be a practical creation of seventeen imperia in imperio: seventeen consulates of seventeen different powers administered seventeen different codes in courts before which alone their subjects were amenable. A plaintiff could only sue a Frenchman in the French court, with appeal to Aix-en-Provence; an Italian in the Italian court, with appeal to Ancona; a Russian in the Russian court, with appeal to Moscow. Nubar's bold design, for which alone he deserves the credit, was to induce these seventeen powers to consent to abandon their jurisdiction in civil actions, to substitute mixed International Courts and a uniform code binding on <b>all.</b> <b>That</b> <b>in</b> spite of the jealousies of all the powers, {{in spite of the}} opposition of the Sublime Porte, he should have succeeded, places him at once in the first rank of statesmen of his period. Nubar made no attempt {{to get rid of the}} criminal jurisdiction exercised by the consular representatives of the foreign powers — such a proposal would have had, at that time, no chance of success.|$|E
25|$|At the Manor Christmas party, Will {{once again}} sees Dawson and Old George {{who seem to}} know him well. Miss Greythorne and Merriman debate about {{when and how to}} {{approach}} Will about his destiny. Maggie Barnes (Amelia Warner), an attractive local girl appears at the party and Will becomes upset when one of his older brothers approaches her and begins chatting to her. Will leaves the Manor, and an ominous figure mounted on a white horse and accompanied by dogs chases Will. As the ominous figure prepares to kill Will, who is currently no match for him, Miss Greythorne, Merriman, Dawson, and Old George suddenly appear and save Will. Merriman names the threatening figure as The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), who warns them <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> five days' time his power – The Dark – will rise. The four adults are the last of the Old Ones – ancient warriors who serve The Light – and take Will on a walk through time and space to a place called the Great Hall, which in the present day is the church the Stantons attend. Will is the last of the Old Ones to have been born: he is the seventh son of a seventh son whose power begins to ascend on his fourteenth birthday, though Will disputes this idea because he believes he is the sixth son. Will is The Seeker: the sign-seeker who must locate six Signs whose possession will grant The Light power over The Dark. The Rider is also seeking them. Will returns home to his attic room and falls and twists his ankle. The doctor who calls is The Rider in disguise but he is recognized by Will. The Rider demonstrates his powers on Will’s ankle by alternately healing it and making it much worse before restoring it to its injured state; he offers Will the chance to have any desire he wants fulfilled in exchange for giving him the signs. Will discovers he has a lost twin brother named Tom, who, as a baby, mysteriously disappeared one night and was never found. Merriman instructs Will on his powers, which include sensing the Signs, summoning superhuman strength, commanding light and fire, telekinesis, stepping through time, and the unique knowledge to decipher an ancient text in the Book of Gramarye. Unfortunately, Will learns he can't fly, a power he wanted.|$|E

500|$|The attack {{started at}} 21:00, 11 November 1940, {{when the first}} of two waves of Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers took off from Illustrious, {{followed}} by the second wave an hour later. The attack was a [...] great success: the Italian fleet lost half its strength in one night. The [...] "fleet-in-being" [...] diminished in importance and the threat to the Royal Navy's control of the Mediterranean had been considerably reduced. Cunningham said of the victory: [...] "Taranto, and the night of 11–12 November 1940, should be remembered for ever as having shown once and for <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the Fleet Air Arm the Navy has its most devastating weapon." [...] The Royal Navy had launched the first all-aircraft naval attack in history, flying a small number of aircraft from an aircraft carrier. This, and other aspects of the raid, were important facts in the planning of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941: the Japanese planning staff were thought to have studied it intensively.|$|E

So again entering into the collaborating factor, I didn't know what to expect ... and he's probably thinking the same about me. And when we walked away from working with each other, it was just a love connection. I wanted to maintain and keep consistent with the look of the album packaging and book, and I really wanted to keep <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> line, and so he really paid attention, and I think it's really iconic and classic. We totally made magic together on a creative level, it was absolutely amazing. He really got in and listened to where my music was at".|$|E

2500|$|Based on {{the success}} of the 2004 Casualty@Holby City Christmas special, another {{crossover}} was ordered for Christmas 2005. Rather than dividing the episodes between the two series' crews as had previously been standard, this crossover operated as an entirely separate production, with Diana Kyle producing and Paul Harrison directing. A large proportion of the crossover was filmed in a road tunnel in Caernarfon, Wales. Watson commented: [...] "It {{was the only one that}} we could hire for two weeks without causing huge traffic jams. The whole shoot was five weeks long. Staging stunts like car accidents is difficult and stressful at the best of times, but doing <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> a tunnel doubled it. The great advantage was that there was no problem with the weather, it was a totally controlled environment with excellent parking facilities for the unit, and a warm welcome from the locals, which is always nice." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} his children's books {{was to become a}} source of {{considerable}} annoyance to Milne, whose self-avowed aim was to write whatever he pleased and who had, until then, found a ready audience for each change of direction: he had freed pre-war Punch from its ponderous facetiousness; he had made a considerable reputation as a playwright (like his idol J. M. Barrie) {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic; he had produced a witty piece of detective writing in The Red House Mystery (although this was severely criticised by Raymond Chandler for the implausibility of its plot). But once Milne had, in his own words, [...] "said goodbye to <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> 70,000 words" [...] (the approximate length of his four principal children's books), he had no intention of producing any reworkings lacking in originality, given that one of the sources of inspiration, his son, was growing older.|$|E

In Neil Cicierega's Potter Puppet Pals, Draco stars in the episode [...] "Draco Puppet".

I was looking at the ground, lost in deep thought and he clicked it and told me that he was putting it on his poster. He knows when I am ready to do a scene, when I am in character, and the like. For instance, I delayed going on the set by two days and he did not say anything. He called me on the set and said we would start shooting in five days. On the second day, I tried hair, make-up, and costume. He told me I was ready to give my first shot and indeed, I was." [...] About the script Bhansali said that he had worked on the script for 18 months and says, [...] "My film is mainstream in terms of budgets, cast and audience and I had to make sure that I did not hurt anyone but evoked a debate." [...] He points out that without star-clout, such themes will not make any impact on the audience or society.
