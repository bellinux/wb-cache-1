5|$|KQED, after airing The Rejected, did not archive a {{hard copy}} of the {{documentary}}, and for many years, the full documentary was considered lost, with only transcripts available. Robert Chehoski, an <b>archivist</b> for KQED, and Alex Cherian, an <b>archivist</b> for the J. Paul Leonard Library at San Francisco State University, searched for any remaining hard copy {{for up to six}} years. Eventually, the two found that the film was owned by WNET, which funded the film, and a single 2-inch quad videotape was archived in the Library of Congress. The Library's Recording Laboratory had already remastered the film onto a digital format and provided the San Francisco Bay Area Television Archive with a copy, for the purpose of making it available online. The 60-minute film was released by the TV Archive online on May 22, 2015.|$|E

5|$|The title monster was {{designed}} by production designer Richard Cassarino, who created the suit for $500, and was built over a diver's wetsuit. Conditions inside the suit were very hot; combined with the humid weather, this caused Clarke, who performed his own stunts in the film, to sweat profusely. The original mask is currently owned by <b>archivist</b> and occasional actor Bob Burns. Cassarino later worked as production designer for the 1958 film Hell Squad, and also was responsible for designing the sea creature costume in the science fiction film Destination Inner Space (1966).|$|E
5|$|Article Two, {{initially}} {{ratified by}} seven states through 1792 (including Kentucky), was not ratified by another state for eighty years. The Ohio General Assembly ratified it on May 6, 1873 {{in protest of}} an unpopular Congressional pay raise. A century later, on March 6, 1978, the Wyoming Legislature also ratified the article. Gregory Watson, a University of Texas at Austin undergraduate student, started a new push for the article's ratification with a letter-writing campaign to state legislatures. As a result, by May 1992, enough states had approved Article Two (38 of the 50 states in the Union) for it to become the Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.

5|$|Following {{complaints}} from local media over {{limited access to}} Goldschmidt's public papers stored at the Oregon Historical Society (OHS), the state <b>archivist</b> announced May 29 that Goldschmidt would seize the 256 boxes of documents to guarantee public access as defined in a state law passed in 1973. That law required that public access to such records be maintained, but did not specify where the records be kept. Following Goldschmidt's decision to put the documents {{in the care of}} the OHS, the state legislature passed a law requiring future governors to leave their documents in the state archives.

40|$|Traditionally, <b>archivists</b> {{have created}} finding aids {{to be used}} as access points to fonds and collections. The {{creation}} of finding aids is a core archival function that continues today; however, the increasing availability of technology such as databases and open source archival management systems is changing the way that <b>archivists</b> do their work. Technology based resources are becoming a necessary part of archival practice. <b>Archivists</b> have access to an increasing number of innovative tools that can be used when answering reference inquiries.

An initial survey was conducted that asked the following questions: Which reference tools do <b>archivists</b> working in academic archives use when answering reference questions; How frequently do <b>archivists</b> use each reference tool when answering reference questions. From that initial study we conducted a more in depth case study to address the following questions: Why do <b>archivists</b> use the tools that they use? What are the barriers that <b>archivists</b> encounter when trying to use innovative tools? What are the opportunities that come with using innovative tools in archival practice?The results of this study show that while archival management systems are primarily used, other traditional resources, such as finding aids, are used in conjunction with other tools...|$|R

5|$|In 1950, Sir Norman Brook {{attempted}} to have Gowing {{retained in the}} Cabinet Office as the permanent historian, but was stymied by the Treasury and the Civil Service Commission. In 1951, she was told {{that she had no}} chance of being appointed to the grade of Principal, which would have carried retirement benefits with it. She later said that her years at the Cabinet Office were the happiest of her life, but she began looking for another position. In 1955, she applied for a chair in economic history at Oxford, and for a position as a reader at LSE, but was unsuccessful. Sir Norman exploited various administrative loopholes to allow her to be retained at the Cabinet Office, and was prepared to make her the Cabinet Office <b>Archivist,</b> but he could not offer her a pension.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Norman {{was visited}} {{by a young}} Bob Marley in his Bronx apartment. Norman had at that time written a number of songs for Johnny Nash, whose record label had just signed Marley, and Marley wanted {{to learn more about}} rhythm and blues. Along with Al Pyfrom, Norman's co-writer, and Marley's wife Rita, the pair spent several days in a jam session that {{ultimately}} resulted in a 24-minute tape of Marley performing several of his own and Norman-Pyfrom's compositions. According to Reggae <b>archivist</b> Roger Steffens, the tape—which was lost among Norman's possessions for decades—is rare for Marley in that it was influenced by pop music rather than reggae, highlighting a point in Marley's career when he was still trying to find his path. Some of the songs from this early jam session were released on the Marley album Chances Are.|$|E
5|$|The 8-track {{tapes of}} the three shows were {{carefully}} put in storage by Warner Bros. Japan for future use. For the album's 21st anniversary in 1993, Deep Purple author and <b>archivist</b> Simon Robinson decided to enquire via the band's management if the tapes could be located. He discovered the entire show had been recorded well, including all the encores. In July, Robinson and Darron Goodwin remixed the tapes at Abbey Road Studios for an expanded edition, that was then mastered by Peter Mew in September. To compromise between including {{as much of the}} shows as possible and setting a realistic price that most fans would accept, they decided to release a 3-CD box set, titled Live in Japan. This included all {{of the three}} main shows except for two tracks already available on the original album. In their place were two previously unreleased encores.|$|E
40|$|Almost all <b>archivists</b> have at {{one time}} or another confronted the issue of {{managing}} additions to existing archival or manuscript collections. Managing these types of collections can prove extremely challenging, even for experienced professionals. <b>Archivists</b> have several options for making these types of collections available to researchers, but it is not always clear which option is best. <b>Archivists</b> from Purdue University and Georgia State University will discuss two of the options in the following case studies on managing growing collections. These case studies are meant to serve as examples for other <b>archivists</b> who may be faced with managing similar collections. The case studies include justifications for each <b>archivist’s</b> plan of work, the methodology used, the results of the work, and what was learned from the process. Pros and cons relating to each situation are also addressed, and an evaluation form has been included that will help <b>archivists</b> decide what steps to take when dealing with their own expanding collections in the future...|$|R
