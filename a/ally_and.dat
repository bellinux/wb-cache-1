5|$|At the time, several princes {{complained that}} they were being betrayed by Britain, who they {{regarded}} as an <b>ally,</b> <b>and</b> Sir Conrad Corfield resigned his position as head of the Political Department in protest at Mountbatten's policies. Mountbatten's policies were also criticised by the opposition Conservative Party. Winston Churchill compared the language used by the Indian government with that used by Adolf Hitler before the invasion of Austria. Modern historians such as Lumby and Moore, however, take the view that Mountbatten {{played a crucial role in}} ensuring that the princely states agreed to accede to India.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosed with a {{brain tumor}} in March 2017, Noriega {{suffered}} complications during surgery, and died two months later. Generally described as a military dictatorship, Noriega's rule in Panama was marked by repression of the media, {{an expansion of the}} military, and the persecution of political opponents, effectively controlling the outcomes of any elections. He was known for his complicated relationship with the U.S., being described as being its <b>ally</b> <b>and</b> nemesis at the same time. He has been called one of the best-known dictators of his time, and compared to authoritarian rulers such as Muammar Gaddafi and Augusto Pinochet.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Orsini was the Prince of Taranto and Ferdinand's fiercest rival. He had been, however, Alfonso's {{faithful}} <b>ally</b> <b>and</b> {{had developed}} an admiration for Skanderbeg and his campaigns in Albania. After Skanderbeg had sided with his rival, Orsini {{allied with the}} Angevins and refused to recognize Ferdinand as King of Naples. He then {{sent a letter to}} convince Skanderbeg to pull his men out of Italy arguing that Ferdinand's fortunes were hopeless, that Skanderbeg's fame would die out after his supposed debacle, and that an alliance with René would be much more rewarding than an alliance with Ferdinand. Skanderbeg's letter in response, dated to 10 October 1460, stated that he was not a condottieri looking for fortune, but a mature man looking to help his ally. Furthermore, he sent another letter to Ferdinand assuring him his loyalty. Another letter was sent to Pius assuring him that the Albanians were fit for battle in Italy, something the Italian rulers did not believe. The letters elucidate Skanderbeg's political motives behind his Italian expedition, presenting himself as a noble <b>ally,</b> <b>and</b> also illustrate the influence of the Renaissance in Skanderbeg's court. They also served a psychological purpose to intimidate Ferdinand's rivals: Skanderbeg compared himself to Pyrrhus of Epirus of antiquity who marched into Italy to defend the Greek city-states from Roman expansion.|$|E

5|$|On 3 November, Hurdt and Amangkurat {{were joined}} by a column led by Willem Bastinck from Surabaya, {{accompanied}} by 800 ox-carts carrying supplies.

On 6 November, rebel forces raided these carts, burnt around ten of them, and killed some people.

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{disagree with}} this narrative, Professor Constantin Zuckerman going {{as far as}} to suggest that the True Cross was actually lost, and that the wood contained in the allegedly still sealed reliquary brought to Jerusalem by Heraclius in 629 was a fake. In his analysis, the hoax was designed to serve the political purposes of both Heraclius and his former foe, recently turned <b>ally</b> <b>and</b> co-father-in-law, Persian general and soon-to-become king, Shahrvaraz.|$|E
5|$|The growing Polish-Soviet tension was {{beginning}} to strain Western-Soviet relations {{at a time when}} the Poles' importance to the Allies, significant in the first years of the war, {{was beginning}} to fade, due to the entry into the conflict of the military and industrial giants, the Soviet Union and the United States. In retrospective review of records, both British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt were increasingly torn between their commitments to their Polish <b>ally</b> <b>and</b> the demands by Stalin and his diplomats.|$|E
5|$|Although Gebhard had {{gathered}} some troops around him, {{he hoped to}} recruit support from the Lutheran princes. Unfortunately for him, he had converted to another branch of the Reformed faith; such cautious Lutheran princes as Augustus I, Elector of Saxony, balked at extending their military support to Calvinists and the Elector Palatine was unable to persuade them to join the cause. Gebhard had three primary supporters. His brother, Karl, had married Eleonore, Countess of Hohenzollern (1551–after 1598), and Gebhard could hope that this family alliance with the power-hungry Hohenzollerns would help his cause. Another long-time <b>ally</b> <b>and</b> supporter Adolf, Count von Neuenahr, was a successful and cunning military commander whose army secured {{the northern part of}} the territory. Finally, John Casimir (1543–1592), the brother of the Elector Palatine, had expressed his support, and made a great show of force in the southern part of the Electorate.|$|E

After surviving the intense barrage of artillery fire of the EOS test, the pilot wonders why they must be terminated by their <b>ally</b> <b>and</b> questions their military leaders' rationale for the war.|$|E
5|$|Born in Daviess County, Kentucky, Ford {{attended}} the University of Kentucky, but his studies were interrupted by his service in World War II. After the war, {{he graduated from}} the Maryland School of Insurance and returned to Kentucky to help his father with the family insurance business. He also continued his military service in the Kentucky Army National Guard. He worked on the gubernatorial campaign of Bert T. Combs in 1959, and became Combs' executive assistant when Combs was elected governor. Encouraged to run for the Kentucky Senate by Combs' <b>ally</b> <b>and</b> successor, Ned Breathitt, Ford won the seat and served one four-year term before running for lieutenant governor in 1967. He was elected on a split ticket with Republican Louie B. Nunn. Four years later, Ford defeated Combs in an upset in the Democratic primary en route to the governorship.|$|E
5|$|By 1678, Frederick William {{had cleared}} Swedish Pomerania and {{occupied}} most of it, {{with the exception}} of Rügen which was held by Denmark–Norway. This was followed by another success against Sweden, when Frederick William cleared Prussia of Swedish forces in {{what became known as the}} Great Sleigh Drive. However, when Louis XIV of France concluded the Dutch War by the Nijmegen treaties, he marched his armies east to relieve his Swedish <b>ally,</b> <b>and</b> forced Frederick William to basically return to the status quo ante bellum by the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679). Though the Scanian War resulted only in minor territorial gains, attaching a small strip of the Swedish Pomeranian right bank of the lower Oder to Brandenburg-Prussian Pomerania, the war resulted in a huge gain of prestige for the elector.|$|E
