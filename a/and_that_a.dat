5|$|In Ex parte Milburn (1835), the Court denied an {{original}} habeas petition concerning pretrial detention holding that the forfeiture of bail {{for failure to}} appear did not satisfy a criminal indictment <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> prior granting of the writ of habeas corpus was no bar to a subsequent arrest warrant.|$|E

5|$|A further twelve bodies, pending {{refinements}} {{of knowledge}} regarding their physical properties, were possible candidates {{to join the}} list under this definition. Some objects in this second list were more likely eventually to be adopted as 'planets' than others. Despite what had been claimed in the media, the proposal did not necessarily leave the Solar System with only twelve planets. Mike Brown, the discoverer of Sedna and Eris, has said that at least 53 known bodies in the Solar System probably fit the definition, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> complete survey would probably reveal more than 200.|$|E
5|$|According to Hayes' confession, {{the two men}} {{had planned}} to rob the Petit house under cover of {{darkness}} leaving the family bound, but unharmed. Hayes attributed the outcome to a change of plan. Upon their arrival {{in the early hours of}} July 23, they found William Petit sleeping on a couch on the porch. Komisarjevsky struck William on the head with a baseball bat found in the yard and then tied him up at gunpoint in the basement. The children and their mother were then bound and locked in their respective rooms. Hayes said that he and Komisarjevsky were not satisfied with their haul, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> bankbook was found which showed an available balance.|$|E
5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said {{the statement}} represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E

5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Although the High Court {{ordered that}} {{the verdict of}} the {{original}} conviction be overturned <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> retrial be conducted, {{there was never any}} retrial since Dietrich had already served his sentence. Dietrich was released on parole in July 1990, and he subsequently changed his name by deed poll to Hugo Rich.|$|E
5|$|Although, in many areas, Scalia's {{approach}} was unfavorable to criminal defendants, {{he took the}} side of defendants in matters involving the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees defendants the right to confront their accusers. In multiple cases, Scalia wrote against laws that allowed alleged victims of child abuse to testify behind screens or by closed-circuit television. In a 2009 case, Scalia wrote the majority opinion in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, holding that defendants must {{have the opportunity to}} confront lab technicians in drug cases <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> certificate of analysis is not enough to prove a substance was a drug.|$|E

5|$|An {{investigation}} found several shortcomings in the airline's operating procedures, in particular lack of proper cockpit communication and mutual {{control of the}} descent and approach plans. This was in part caused by the airline electing to not follow the Sterile Cockpit Rule <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> passenger {{was sitting in a}} cockpit jump seat during the flight. The investigating commission also found lack of proper pilot training in the airline. Flight 710 was the second of four Widerøe accidents between 1982 and 1993, all of which revealed shortcomings in the airline's operations and internal control.|$|E
5|$|As Luis Cardinal is {{identified}} as Skinner's shooter, the Syndicate admonishes the Smoking Man for moving the UFO to a new location. By rubbing a pencil over the envelope containing the tape case, Mulder finds a phone number which connects him to the Syndicate's office. Mulder speaks to the Well-Manicured Man, who offers to meet with him. The Well-Manicured Man tells Mulder that a UFO was sunk during World War II <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> cover story of a sunken atomic bomb was used to cover up its attempted recovery. He reveals that anyone can be gotten to, causing Mulder to ask Scully to check on Skinner.|$|E
5|$|As the CIP allowed licensees {{to import}} goods at half price, it was {{regarded}} as a virtual guarantee of business success, regardless of entrepreneurial skill. As a result, the licenses were highly prized. For those who were not confident in their sales ability, a healthy profit was usually made by selling their license to other willing businessmen, especially as demand far outstripped supply. A 1966 US Government report concluded {{that it was possible to}} guarantee a 100% domestic profit on piasters, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> 50% profit could be safely achieved by using black market exchange rates and depositing one's money in an American bank.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of {{graduation}} all officers are qualified for operational service. However, each employee must undergo 40 hours of yearly training, including firearms practice, to keep their operational certification. Without this, they cannot patrol, use firearms or participate in actions. Forty-four percent of police officers in 2012 lacked such certification. The main {{reason is that the}} police districts see it as a waste of resources to train investigation and administrative staff which do not participate in operative duty, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> higher quality is achieved through specialization of tasks, such as dedicated investigation personnel.|$|E
5|$|Based on Kinsey's scale where 0 {{represents}} {{a person with}} an exclusively heterosexual response and 6 {{represents a}} person with an exclusively homosexual one, and numbers in between represent a gradient of responses with both sexes, 6% of those interviewed ranked as a 6: exclusively homosexual. Apart from those who ranked 0 (71%), the largest percentage in between 0 and 6 was 1 at approximately 15%. However, the Kinsey Report remarked that the ranking described a period in a person's life, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> person's orientation may change. Among the criticisms the Kinsey Report received, a particular one addressed the Institute for Sex Research's tendency to use statistical sampling, which facilitated an over-representation of same-sex relationships by other researchers who did not adhere to Kinsey's qualifications of data.|$|E

5|$|Bethe {{managed to}} work it out on the train from New York to Schenectady. He arrived at a value of 1040MHz, {{extremely}} close to that obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. He did so by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculations. His paper, published in the Physical Review in August 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. Hitherto, it had been assumed that the infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new, radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.|$|E
5|$|Between 1808 and 1812 {{another group}} of ascetic Jews, known as Perushim, immigrated to Palestine from Lithuania. They were disciples of the Vilna Gaon and had settled {{in the city of}} Safed to the north. Some had wished to settle in Jerusalem and reclaim the Ashkenazic Compound. They were worried, however, that {{descendants}} of the Arab creditors still held the old promissory notes relating to the century-old debts incurred by he-Hasid's followers <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new group of Ashkenazic immigrants would possibly inherit responsibility for repayment. The descendants of a group of Hasidim who made aliyah in 1777 also presented a problem. They apparently objected to any effort by the Perushim {{to take control of the}} synagogue ruin, claiming it had never belonged to the Perushim or their ancestors. The Hasidim claimed they had closer ties with the original owners and that their rights to the parcel of land were greater.|$|E
5|$|Brown and the Labour {{party had}} pledged {{to allow a}} {{referendum}} on the EU Treaty of Lisbon. On 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband attended for the Prime Minister at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon of the EU Reform Treaty. Brown's opponents {{on both sides of the}} House, and in the press, suggested that ratification by Parliament was not enough <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> referendum should also be held. Labour's 2005 manifesto had pledged to give British public {{a referendum on the}} original EU Constitution. Brown argued that the Treaty significantly differed from the Constitution, and as such did not require a referendum. He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic, and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.|$|E
