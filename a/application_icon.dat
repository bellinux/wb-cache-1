5|$|System 6's Apple menu {{cannot be}} used to launch applications. The current <b>application</b> <b>icon</b> in the upper {{right-hand}} corner of the menu bar cycles between open applications; {{it is not a}} menu. System 6 supports 24bits of addressable random access memory (RAM), which allowed a maximum of 8megabytes of RAM with no provision for virtual memory. These limitations were fixed in System 7. The version of the HFS used by System 6 also has a hard drive capacity limit; it supports up to 2gigabytes (GBs) and 65,536 files on a drive. This limitation was not increased until System 7.5 which first increased the limit to 4GB.|$|E
25|$|PlayStation 3 {{firmware}} 4.30 {{was released}} 24 October 2012. This release caused some complaints, as the <b>application</b> <b>icon</b> was made mandatory for all European PlayStation 3 users, and cannot {{be removed from}} the XMB menu. Various petitions have been started in response to the new icon, but no changes have been made as of today, except on 28 October 2014, when the XMB icon was updated. The icon is still appearing as of 2017.|$|E
2500|$|... tvOS {{ships with}} all-new {{development}} tools for developers. tvOS adds {{support for an}} all-new SDK for developers to build apps for the TV including all of the APIs included in iOS 9 such as Metal. It also adds an App Store which allows users to browse, download, and install {{a wide variety of}} applications. In addition, developers can now use their own interface inside of their application rather than only being able to use Apple's interface. Since tvOS is based on iOS, it is easy to port existing iOS apps to the Apple TV with Xcode while making only a few refinements to the app to better suit the larger screen. Apple provides Xcode free of charge to all registered Apple developers. To develop for the new Apple TV, it is necessary to make a parallax image for the <b>application</b> <b>icon.</b> In order to do this, Apple provides a Parallax exporter and previewer in the development tools for the Apple TV.|$|E

50|$|So the component-orientation mixes {{a set of}} {{features}} of its predecessor models. Understanding it is simpler while thinking of the visual component, that is an application which not being deployed into an executable or bytecode but otherwise turned to be linked by an icon inside another <b>application,</b> <b>icon</b> when one clicks on it implements certain tasks. Then this concepts can be extended to non-visual components.|$|E

40|$|The Internet-based desktop {{environment}} {{as defined in}} this paper consists of a cross-platform browser, a number of server icons (host nodes), a number of <b>application</b> <b>icons</b> (program nodes) {{and a number of}} data icons (file nodes). In contrast to typical desktops of today, where data icons may be dragged and dropped onto <b>application</b> <b>icons</b> for execution, this environment allows (1) user-defined and reconfigurable execution sequences by creating dependency edges between program nodes (<b>application</b> <b>icons)</b> and file nodes (data icons); (2) data-dependent execution sequences by dynamic scheduling of path as well as loop executions; (3) host-transparency as to the location of applications and data (both can reside on any host with a unique IP address). We argue that the Internet-based workflow paradigm is suitable for creation of dynamically reconfigurable desktop environments. The summary of 450 Internet-based experiments demonstrates (1) the value of making the desktop recordable, and (2) the [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Icons {{could be}} dragged and dropped {{for the first}} time, in {{addition}} to having a more detailed appearance. A file could be dragged onto the Print Manager icon and the file would be printed by the current printer, assuming it was associated with an application capable of printing, such as a word processor. Alternatively, the file could be dragged out of File Manager and dropped onto an <b>application</b> <b>icon</b> or window for processing.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of iOS 9, the application switcher received a significant visual change; whilst still retaining the card metaphor introduced in iOS 7, the <b>application</b> <b>icon</b> is smaller, and appears above the screenshot (which is now larger, due to the removal of [...] "Recent and Favorite Contacts"), and each application [...] "card" [...] overlaps the other, forming a rolodex effect as the user scrolls. Now, instead of the home screen appearing at the leftmost of the application switcher, it appears rightmost.|$|E
5000|$|The {{notification}} {{area has}} been redesigned; the standard Volume, Network, Power and Action Center status icons are present, but no other <b>application</b> <b>icons</b> are shown unless the user has chosen them to be shown. A new [...] "Notification Area Icons" [...] control panel has been added which replaces the [...] "Customize Notification Icons" [...] dialog box in the [...] "Taskbar and Start Menu Properties" [...] window first introduced in Windows XP. In addition {{to being able to}} configure whether the <b>application</b> <b>icons</b> are shown, the ability to hide each application's notification balloons has been added. The user can then view the notifications at a later time.|$|R

50|$|Created and {{developed}} by Swedish programmer Peter Borg, {{it was first}} seen registered on Sourceforge in May 2004, and had received much support and feedback from the Mac open-source community. The name of the application {{is derived from the}} common Swedish woodland strawberry, hence the <b>application</b> <b>icon.</b> Lingon, another program developed by Borg, is named after another common Scandinavian berry. As of July 31, 2009, Borg has announced that he would no longer be developing Smultron, however active development was later resumed after a hiatus.|$|E
50|$|The engine would {{automatically}} display the proper balloon {{based on the}} mouse location and the item's current state. It also positioned the balloon using an algorithm designed {{to keep it from}} covering the objects being examined and adjusted the cartouche to point appropriately. Help text for most common UI elements, such as the Close Box on a window, was built into the system. Developers could also include balloons for their <b>application</b> <b>icon</b> itself, allowing users to identify an unknown application in the Finder without launching it.|$|E
50|$|The Quick Launch toolbar {{has been}} removed from the default configuration, but may be easily added. The Windows 7 taskbar is more application-oriented than window-oriented, and {{therefore}} doesn't show window titles (these are shown when an <b>application</b> <b>icon</b> is clicked or hovered over). Applications can now be pinned to the taskbar allowing the user instant access to the applications they commonly use. There are a few ways to pin applications to the taskbar. Icons can be dragged and dropped onto the taskbar, or the applicationâ€™s icon can be right-clicked to pin it to the taskbar.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} common and {{important}} examples of this are <b>Application</b> <b>Icons,</b> used to represent an app on Mac, Windows, Linux, or mobile platforms. These icons rely on unique and memorable metaphors as a form of product branding. Other common uses of icons include favicons, toolbar icons, and icons for buttons or controls.|$|R
50|$|The N900 was {{launched}} alongside Maemo 5, giving the device an overall more touch-friendly interface than its predecessors and a customizable home screen which mixes <b>application</b> <b>icons</b> with shortcuts and widgets.

5000|$|It {{was only}} after Steve Job's early {{departure}} from Apple, in 1985, that Tog came to oversee the interface for both machines. During this period, Tog {{was responsible for the}} design of the Macintosh's hierarchical menus and invented time-out dialog boxes, which, after a visible countdown, carry out the default activity without the user explicitly clicking. He also invented the [...] "package" [...] illusion later used by Apple for Macintosh applications: Applications, along with all their supporting files, reside inside a [...] "package" [...] that, in turn, appears to be the application itself, appearing as an <b>application</b> <b>icon,</b> not as a folder. This illusion makes possible the simple drag-and-drop installation and deletion of Mac applications.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of System 7, which {{included}} a standard co-operative multitasking feature, the need for DAs diminished greatly, and developers were encouraged to develop small applications instead. The system continued to run DAs (and still does up to Mac OS 9.x) for backward compatibility. Under System 7 and later, DAs could be moved and renamed using the Finder like normal applications, removing the need for Font/DA Mover and confining suitcases to font management. When a DA was run under System 7, it always executed in the Finder's address space. The icon for a desk accessory program under System 7 and later is roughly a reversed version of the <b>application</b> <b>icon,</b> with the writing hand {{on the left side}} instead of the right.|$|E

This release included many changes since the previous beta release based on user feedback. A significant visual change in this release was the introduction of a new <b>application</b> <b>icon</b> which added a common design theme to all the Windows Live Essentials applications. The words [...] "beta" [...] was removed from the build number.

5000|$|Thumbnail previews {{which were}} {{introduced}} in Windows Vista have been expanded to not only preview the windows opened by the application in a small-sized thumbnail view, but to also interact with them. The user can close any window opened by clicking the X on the corresponding thumbnail preview. The name of the window is also shown in the thumbnail preview. A [...] "peek" [...] at the window is obtained by hovering over the thumbnail preview. Peeking brings up only {{the window of the}} thumbnail preview over which the mouse cursor hovers, and turns any other windows on the desktop transparent. This also works for tabs in Internet Explorer: individual tabs may be peeked at in the thumbnail previews. Thumbnail previews integrate Thumbnail Toolbars [...] which can control the application from the thumbnail previews themselves. For example, if Windows Media Player is opened and the mouse cursor is hovering on the <b>application</b> <b>icon,</b> the thumbnail preview will allow the user the ability to Play, Stop, and Play Next/Previous track without having to switch to the Windows Media Player window.|$|E
50|$|K Desktop Environment 3.4 {{focused on}} {{improving}} accessibility. The update added a text-to-speech system with support for Konqueror, Kate, KPDF, the standalone application KSayIt and text-to-speech synthesis on the desktop. A new high contrast style {{and a complete}} monochrome icon set were added, {{as well as an}} icon effect to paint all KDE icons into any two arbitrary colors (third party <b>application</b> <b>icons</b> would be converted into a high contrast monochrome color scheme).|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to applications links, many home screens are also capable of displaying ambient information, such as live tiles on Windows Phone or widgets on Android. Such tiles or widgets may link to applications, however they differ from traditional links {{in that they}} show current, dynamic information instead of a static icon. However, the increased relevance of the information can come {{at the cost of}} device battery life, bandwidth, and the ease of recognition afforded by static <b>application</b> <b>icons.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Home Menu is a {{graphical}} shell {{similar to}} the Nintendo DSi Menu and Wii U Menu for Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo 2DS systems. Itâ€™s used to launch software stored on Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS Game Cards, applications installed on an SD card and DSiWare titles installed in the systemâ€™s internal memory. <b>Application</b> <b>icons</b> are set in a grid navigable with the touchscreen or D-pad, and may be re-arranged via drag-and-drop. The amount of icons per column can also be changed, from 1 icon up to 6. The menu can display up to 120 application tiles. On the upper screen, a special 3D animated logo is displayed for each individual app, as well as system information such as wireless signal strength, date and time, and battery life, while on the bottom screen, <b>application</b> <b>icons</b> are displayed. It is also possible to change the screen's brightness while in the menu. Using the Home button, users can suspend the current software that is running and bring up the Home Menu, allowing the user to launch certain multitasking applications, such as the Internet Browser and Miiverse.|$|R
