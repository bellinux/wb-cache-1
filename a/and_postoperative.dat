25|$|While loss-of-function {{mutations}} in KCNE1 cause Long QT syndrome, gain-of-function KCNE1 mutations {{are associated with}} early-onset atrial fibrillation.

Atrial KCNE1 expression was downregulated in a porcine model of post-operative atrial fibrillation following lung lobectomy.|$|E
25|$|Anesthesiology (also {{known as}} anaesthetics): {{concerned}} with the perioperative management of the surgical patient. The anesthesiologist's role during surgery is to prevent derangement in the vital organs' (i.e. brain, heart, kidneys) functions <b>and</b> <b>postoperative</b> pain. Outside of the operating room, the anesthesiology physician also serves the same function in the labor & delivery ward, and some are specialized in critical medicine.|$|E
25|$|The 5-HT3 antagonists {{are also}} {{indicated}} in the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV), when needed, <b>and</b> <b>postoperative</b> nausea and vomiting (PONV). Although they are more effective at controlling CINV—where they stop symptoms altogether in up to 70% of people, and reduce them in the remaining 30%—, they are just as effective as other agents for PONV.|$|E

25|$|The interscalene {{block is}} {{performed}} by injecting local anesthetic to the nerves of the brachial plexus {{as it passes}} through the groove between the anterior and middle scalene muscles, {{at the level of}} the cricoid cartilage. This block is particularly useful in providing anesthesia <b>and</b> <b>postoperative</b> analgesia for surgery to the clavicle, shoulder, and arm. Advantages of this block include rapid blockade of the shoulder region, and relatively easily palpable anatomical landmarks. Disadvantages of this block include inadequate anesthesia in the distribution of the ulnar nerve, which makes this an unreliable block for operations involving the forearm and hand.|$|E
25|$|The {{axillary}} {{block is}} particularly useful in providing anesthesia <b>and</b> <b>postoperative</b> analgesia for surgery to the elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand. The axillary block {{is also the}} safest of the four main approaches to the brachial plexus, as it does not risk paresis of the phrenic nerve, nor does it {{have the potential to}} cause pneumothorax. In the axilla, the nerves of the brachial plexus and the axillary artery are enclosed together in a fibrous sheath which is a continuation of the deep cervical fascia. The easily palpated axillary artery thus serves as a reliable anatomical landmark for this block, and the injection of local anesthetic close to this artery frequently leads to a good block of the brachial plexus. The axillary block is commonly performed due to its ease of performance and relatively high success rate.|$|E

30|$|When it {{is applied}} by {{experienced}} surgeons, septoplasty {{is mostly a}} daily operation owing to the short duration of surgery <b>and</b> easy <b>postoperative</b> care (Ridenour 1998).

50|$|In limb amputees, some, but not all, {{studies have}} found a {{correlation}} between preoperative pain in the affected limb <b>and</b> <b>postoperative</b> phantom pain. There is a significant association between painful and non-painful phantom experiences, preoperative pain in the symptomatic eye and headache. Based on the present data, {{it is difficult to}} determine if headaches or preoperative eye pain play a causal role in the development of phantom phenomena or if headache, preoperative eye pain, <b>and</b> <b>postoperative</b> phantom eye experiences are only epiphenomena of an underlying factor. However, a study in humans demonstrated that experimental pain leads to a rapid reorganization of the somatosensory cortex. This study suggests that preoperative <b>and</b> <b>postoperative</b> pain may be an important co-factor for somatosensory reorganization and the development of phantom experiences.|$|E

40|$|Objective. Our {{present study}} tested whether {{flurbiprofen}} axetil could reduce perioperative sufentanil consumption <b>and</b> provide <b>postoperative</b> analgesia with decrease in emergency agitation and systemic proinflammatory cytokines release. Methods. Ninety patients undergoing tangential excision surgery {{were randomly assigned}} to three groups: (1) preoperative dose of 100 [*]mg flurbiprofen axetil <b>and</b> a <b>postoperative</b> dose of 2 [*]μg/kg sufentanil and 10 [*]mL placebo by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, (2) preoperative dose of 100 [*]mg flurbiprofen axetil <b>and</b> a <b>postoperative</b> dose of 2 [*]μg/kg sufentanil and 100 [*]mg flurbiprofen axetil by PCA pump, and (3) 10 [*]mL placebo <b>and</b> a <b>postoperative</b> dose of 2 [*]μg/kg sufentanil and 10 [*]mL placebo by PCA pump. Results. Preoperative administration of flurbiprofen axetil decreased <b>postoperative</b> tramadol consumption <b>and</b> the visual analog scale at 4, 6, 12, and 24 [*]h after surgery, which were further decreased by postoperative administration of flurbiprofen axetil. Furthermore, flurbiprofen axetil attenuated emergency agitation score and Ramsay score at 0, 5, and 10 [*]min after extubation and reduced the TNF-α and interleukin- (IL-) 6 levels at 24 and 48 [*]h after the operation. Conclusion. Flurbiprofen axetil enhances analgesic effects of sufentanil and attenuates emergence agitation and systemic proinflammation in patients undergoing tangential excision surgery...|$|R
