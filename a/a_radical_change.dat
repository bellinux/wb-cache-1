5|$|<b>A</b> <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> of tactics, which {{involved}} {{the introduction of}} a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the French colonies, was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen. It was a shrewd move, since the majority of British ships were now flying American flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war. A bill was introduced and approved by the cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, so as not to draw any attention to the effect of the bill. The approach proved successful, and the new Foreign Slave Trade Bill was quickly passed, and received royal assent on 23 May 1806.|$|E
5|$|The May Revolution {{began the}} Argentine War of Independence, {{although}} no formal {{declaration of independence}} was issued {{at the time and}} the Primera Junta continued to govern {{in the name of the}} deposed king, FerdinandVII. As similar events occurred in many other cities of the continent, the May Revolution is also considered one of the early events of the Spanish American wars of independence. Historians today debate whether the revolutionaries were truly loyal to the Spanish crown or whether the declaration of fidelity to the king was a necessary ruse to conceal the true objective—to achieve independence—from a population that was not yet ready to accept such <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>change.</b> A formal declaration of independence was finally issued at the Congress of Tucumán on July9, 1816.|$|E
5|$|Vargas Llosa's fourth major novel, The War of the End of the World (La guerra del fin del mundo), was {{published}} in 1981 and was his first attempt at a historical novel. This work initiated <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> in Vargas Llosa's style towards themes such as messianism and irrational human behaviour. It recreates the War of Canudos, an incident in 19th-century Brazil in which an armed millenarian cult held off a siege by the national army for months. As in Vargas Llosa's earliest work, this novel carries a sober and serious theme, and its tone is dark. Vargas Llosa's bold exploration of humanity's propensity to idealize violence, and his account of a man-made catastrophe brought on by fanaticism on all sides, earned the novel substantial recognition.|$|E

5|$|Even by May 1943 Mark II ASV (Air-to-surface-vessel) {{was still}} being used. By then the German Metox {{receivers}} could detect the 1.5m radiations. A variable condenser was installed as an interim solution to reduce {{the strength of the}} signal. This gave U-boats the impression the aircraft was moving away from it. There was <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> in 1943 with radar equipment when the ASV Mark III was becoming available. Based on RAF Bomber Command's H2S, it transmitted a much shorter wavelength of 9.1cm instead of 1.5m as with Mark Is and IIs and could not be detected by Metox receivers in U-boats. Instead of fixed aerials there was a rotary scanner, and thus the return signals gave a visual trace through 360 degrees on a CRT known as the Plan Position Indicator (PPI). The Mark II would only cover a forward arc, unlike the Mark III. The Mark III would indicate surface vessels via a dot on the screen while the coast would be given in the shape of an outline. Targets remained visible on the screen to within a quarter of a mile. The Mark III also suffered much less from 'sea return' obscuring targets at short range.|$|E

During the 12 years Gabriel Ochoa Uribe worked as coach of the team, América obtained its first seven National Cups and rapidly created an immense diversity of fans that cheered it around the country.

Along with Constantine Tripsychos and Theodore Dadibrenos, Hagiochristophorites strangled Alexios II Komnenos with a bowstring in September/October 1183, leaving Andronikos as the sole emperor, a feat for which he was rewarded with the rank of pansebastos sebastos and the post of logothetes tou dromou.|$|E
25|$|Egypt's post-war {{domestic}} politics were experiencing <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>change,</b> prompted {{in no small}} part by economic instability, inflation, and unemployment. Unrest began to manifest itself in the growth of radical political groups, such as the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, and an increasingly hostile attitude towards Britain and its presence in the country. Added to this anti-British fervour was the role Britain had played in the creation of Israel. As a result, the actions of the Egyptian government began to mirror those of its populace and an anti-British policy began to permeate Egypt's relations with Britain.|$|E

The results were taken from three in-depth case studies using the triangulation approach which includes open-ended interviews and use of secondary data. The results had shown six important leadership factors as key driver to enable process change to happen successfully. Leaders {{need to be able}} to practise different leadership approaches or styles based on situations, emphasise on a strategic vision, use effective communications, do reinforcement give commitment and support, and have leadership qualities.

25|$|The interwar {{period was}} also marked by <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> in the {{international}} order, away from {{the balance of power}} that had dominated pre–World War I Europe. One main institution that was meant to bring stability was the League of Nations, which was created after the First World War with the intention of maintaining world security and peace and encouraging economic growth between member countries. The League was undermined by the bellicosity of Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, the Soviet Union, and Mussolini's Italy, and by the non-participation of the United States, leading many to question its effectiveness and legitimacy.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} protests demands <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> in Spanish politics, as protesters do not {{consider}} themselves to be represented by any traditional party nor favoured by the measures approved by politicians.

25|$|Later in 1969 when Biba {{moved to}} its first upscale store {{on the north side}} of Kensington High Street, across from where they would later open up their {{department}} store, there was <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> in that the clothes became more expensive and the Biba styles then appeared to be designed for more sophisticated and richer young women in their 20s. The Kensington High Street store also lost the cozy boudoir look of its predecessor, which had been so appealing to its teenage customers, and took on the more sophisticated look of the upscale Kensington/Knightsbridge designer stores.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} {{contribution}} of Woodward's {{career in the}} early 1940s {{was a series of}} papers describing the application of ultraviolet spectroscopy in the elucidation of the structure of natural products. Woodward collected together a large amount of empirical data, and then devised a series of rules later called the Woodward's rules, which could be applied to finding out the structures of new natural substances, as well as non-natural synthesized molecules. The expedient use of newly developed instrumental techniques was a characteristic Woodward exemplified throughout his career, and it marked <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> from the extremely tedious and long chemical methods of structural elucidation that had been used until then.|$|E
25|$|Homo sapiens {{settled in}} Brittany around 35,000 years ago. They {{replaced}} or absorbed the Neanderthals and developed local industries, {{similar to the}} Châtelperronian or to the Magdalenian. After the last glacial period, the warmer climate allowed the area to become heavily wooded. At that time, Brittany was populated by relatively large communities who started to change their lifestyles from a life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers. Agriculture was introduced during the 5th millennium BC by migrants {{from the south and}} east. However, the Neolithic Revolution in Brittany did not happen due to <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> of population, but by slow immigration and exchange of skills.|$|E

By the 1930s many stations, including those on the periphery, had health clinics run by missionary nurses or by African assistants.
