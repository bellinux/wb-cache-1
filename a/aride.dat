Particularly well-known is the coco de mer, a species of palm that grows only on the islands of Praslin and neighbouring Curieuse. Sometimes nicknamed the [...] "love nut" [...] because the shape of its [...] "double" [...] coconut resembles buttocks, the coco-de-mer produces the world's heaviest seed. The jellyfish tree {{is to be found}} in only a few locations on Mahe. This strange and ancient plant in a genus of its own (Medusagyne) seems to reproduce only in cultivation and not in the wild.

50|$|The name ‘Aride’ first {{appears on}} {{nautical}} charts after French voyages of exploration in 1770 and 1771.

In 1868, the Irishman Perceval Wright, who gave his name to Aride’s unique gardenia {{and one of its}} endemic lizards, visited <b>Aride.</b> In 1883, the British artist Marianne North painted a scene on the island, reporting just one large tree, beneath which the island staff sheltered from the sun. Coconut palms were planted over much of <b>Aride</b> and copra production became important economically. Dogs, pigs, cats and chickens were introduced, though fortunately rats never arrived.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDuring Middle Quaternary, zonation asserts {{itself in}} Ziban, Aures and Nemencha mountains.

This advance is proved by the disparition of calcretes, remplaced by gypsum crusts on the southern piedmont, {{at the end of}} the Middle Quaternary. Simultaneously, the eolian action increases : the wind accumulates an erg in the Lower Sahara, quartzeous and gypseous sands in the Ziban mountains and silty dunes and lunettes around the Garaet et Tarf, north of Aures mountains. Au cours du Quaternaire moyen, la zonation s'affirme dans les Ziban, les Aurès et les Nemencha et fluctue en fonction des phases <b>arides</b> et pluviales.
