40|$|The {{debate on}} how best to assess clinic, or indeed if it should be {{assessed}} at all has raged for decades and shows no sign of abating. The passage of time has been unable to resolve the question of assessment, no doubt {{due in part to the}} expansion and diversification of clinical legal education. The scope of clinic and its role in both society and as a teaching method is constantly evolving and assessment methods must develop to reflect the ever changing clinical profile. In an attempt to bring its <b>assessment</b> <b>regime</b> up to date, in 2007 / 2008 Northumbria University’s Student Law Office modified its <b>assessment</b> <b>regime,</b> replacing outmoded criteria with grade descriptors. This paper focuses on the use of grade descriptors and criterion referenced assessment in clinical legal education, addressing whether clinic should be assessed and which of the two methods is best suited to clinical legal education. The article draws on the experiences of clinicians and students to determine what issues this change in <b>assessment</b> <b>regime</b> has raised for the assessors and the student body. It concludes that it is appropriate to assess clinic by fully grading and suggests grade descriptors are the way forward...|$|E

40|$|Nanotechnology {{has been}} the subject of {{extensive}} "assessment hype", unlike any previous field of research and development. A multiplicity of stakeholders have started to analyze the implications of nanotechnology: Technology assessment institutions around the world, non-governmental organizations, think tanks, re-insurance companies, and academics from science and technology studies and applied ethics have turned their attention to this growing field’s implications. In the course of these assessment efforts, a social phenomenon has emerged – a phenomenon the editors define as <b>assessment</b> <b>regime.</b> Despite the variety of organizations, methods, and actors involved in the evaluation and regulation of emerging nanotechnologies, the assessment activities comply with an overarching scientific and political imperative: Innovations are only welcome if they are assessed against the criteria of safety, sustainability, desirability, and acceptability. So far, such deliberations and reflections have played only a subordinate role. This book argues that with the rise of the nanotechnology <b>assessment</b> <b>regime,</b> however, things have changed dramatically: Situated at the crossroads of democratizing science and technology, good governance, and the quest for sustainable innovations, the <b>assessment</b> <b>regime</b> has become constitutive for technological development. The contributions in this book explore and critically analyse nanotechnology’s assessment regime: To what extent is it constitutive for technology in general, for nanotechnology in particular? What social conditions render the regime a phenomenon sui generis? And what are its implications for science and society...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of understanding students’ engagement is prominent in higher education. Assessment is a main driver of student engagement, a {{phenomenon known as}} backwash. I argue that students’ engagement with learning is often driven by an aesthetic motivation. I establish the connections between Burke’s (and Kant’s) conceptualisation of aesthetics as a dichotomy of beauty and the sublime (which I label the Burkean pendulum) to motivation. I explore the links between this aesthetic motivation and the <b>assessment</b> <b>regime</b> focusing on the Burkean/Kantian sublime and suggest four communication strategies to manage the sublime when it arises in students’ education journeys. My contributions are twofold:firstly, I introduce the Burkean Pendulum {{as a means for}} educators to reflect on the aesthetic aspects of their designed assessment regimes. Secondly, I propose a framework of communication strategy narratives (Thriller, Horror, Exploration, and Action) {{that could be used to}} manage the sublime of the <b>assessment</b> <b>regime...</b>|$|E
