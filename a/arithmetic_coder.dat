The <b>arithmetic</b> <b>coder</b> maintains two high precision binary numbers, plow and phigh, representing the possible range for the total probability that the model would assign to all strings lexicographically less than x, given the bits of x seen so far. The compressed code for x is px, the shortest bit string representing a number between plow and phigh. It is always possible to find a number in this range no more than one bit longer than the Shannon limit, log2 1/p(x). One such number can be obtained from phigh by dropping all of the trailing bits after the first bit that differs from plow.|$|E

The encoder decides whether a particular bit-plane is SW encoded or encoded in intra mode using a binary <b>arithmetic</b> entropy <b>coder.</b> When a specific coding mode has been assigned to every bit-plane, the bit-plane is fed to the appropriate encoder (unless the band the bit-plane belongs to is skipped). The resulting syndrome bits and binary arithmetic coded data are multiplexed with the hash bit-stream, {{as well as the}} mode signalling information, and sent to the decoder or stored for offline decoding.|$|R

Keywords: nearly lossless, semi-lossless, image compression, soft decision quantization, QM coder. 1 INTRODUCTION Image compression methods can be categorized into two classes: lossless and lossy schemes. Entropy encoding {{is an example of}} lossless compression which removes redundancy among symbols without actual loss of information so that the image can be reconstructed exactly as the original one. Quantization is applied in lossy compression schemes to achieve a better coding gain at the expense of information loss and, consequently, the rec [...] ...|$|R

Together with careful design of the bit-plane coding primitives, this enables comparable execution speed to that observed with the simpler variant of SPIHT without <b>arithmetic</b> coding.

The new algorithm only {{applies to the}} shape-adaptive transformation of the pixels inside the object for decorrelation. After transformation, the number of coefficients of the object is as many {{as that of the}} pixels inside the image area. To achieve a quick and lossless transformation, a novel shape-adaptive wavelet transform based on lifting scheme for arbitrarily shaped object is proposed. By analyzing the location of invalid coefficients transformed, the paper also proposes a modified OB- 3 DSPECK (object-based set partitioned embedded block coder) method that cancels symbol outputs of invalid block or coefficients outside the object, specifically, only two types of symbols are output to <b>arithmetic</b> coding <b>coder.</b> For object region of three-dimensional medical images, the proposed algorithm supports the lossy-to-lossless embedded en/decoding. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms OB- 3 DSPECK by 0. 5 dB on the average SNR. Furthermore, because of the reduction of the output of one type symbol, the arithmetic coding becomes optional...|$|R
40|$|With the {{advancement}} of computer graphics in the recent years, {{an increasing number of}} pictures, video and 3 D content is generated by synthesis processing rather than acquired with capture devices such as cameras or scanners. Several techniques have been developed for compression of discrete (i. e. piece-wise planar) 3 D models, in the form of 3 D polygonal meshes. However, no important attempt has been made to compress the smooth surfaces of artificially generated 3 D models, that are most often represented as parametric surfaces, of which Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) is a popular form. This paper presents a method for compressing NURBS 3 D models with a small and controllable loss. The scheme uses a differential pulse coded modulation (DPCM) coder with different predictors for knot values and control points, coupled with a uniform scalar quantizer, followed by a bitplane <b>arithmetic</b> entropy <b>coder.</b> The multiplicity of knots is preserved by the use of a multiplicity map. The rate-distortion characteristics of the proposed scheme are evaluated on various models. When compared to MPEG- 4 [8, 9] and Touma-Gotsman [19] compressed triangular meshes, the proposed scheme achieves more than five times better compression, for equivalent L 2 error and much better visual quality.

40|$|The JPEG 2000 {{standard}} is currently widely adopted in medical and volumetric data compression. In this respect, a 3 D extension (JPEG 2000 Part 10 – JP 3 D) {{is currently being}} standardized. However, no suitable 3 D context model is yet available within the standard, such that the context-based <b>arithmetic</b> entropy <b>coder</b> of JP 3 D still uses the 2 D context model of JPEG 2000 Part 1. In this paper, we propose a context design algorithm that, based on a training set, generates an optimized 3 D context model, while avoiding an exhaustive search {{and at the same}} time keeping the space and time complexities well within the limits of today hardware. The algorithm comes as a solution for the situations in which the number of allowable initial contexts is very large. In this sense, the three-dimensional 3 x 3 x 3 context neighborhood investigated in this paper is a good example of an instantiation that would have otherwise been computationally unfeasible. Furthermore, we have designed a new 3 D context model for JP 3 D. We show that the JP 3 D codec equipped with this model consistently outperforms its 2 D context model counterpart, for an extended test dataset. In this respect, we report a gain in lossless compression performance of up to 10 %. Moreover, for a large range of bitrates, we always obtain gains in PSNR, sometimes even over 3 dB...|$|R

50|$|Compression {{proceeds}} as follows. The initial {{range is}} set to plow = 0, phigh = 1. For each bit, the predictor estimates p0 = p(xi = 0|x1x2...xi - 1) and p1 = 1 &minus; p0, {{the probability of a}} 0 or 1, respectively. The <b>arithmetic</b> <b>coder</b> then divides the current range, (plow, phigh) into two parts in proportion to p0 and p1.

As these are just different interpretations of the same coding methods, and as the resulting arithmetic and range codes are identical, each <b>arithmetic</b> <b>coder</b> is its corresponding range encoder, and vice versa.

It counts, how often {{in the past the}} next pixel has been black or white in the same neighborhood, and estimates from that the probability distribution of the next pixel.
