500|$|Cooper's acting style {{consisted}} of three essential characteristics: his ability to project elements of his own personality onto the characters he portrayed, to appear natural and authentic in his roles, and to underplay and deliver restrained performances calibrated for the camera and the screen. <b>Acting</b> <b>teacher</b> Lee Strasberg once observed: [...] "The simplest examples of Stanislavsky's ideas are actors such as Gary Cooper, John Wayne, and Spencer Tracy. They try not to act but to be themselves, to respond or react. They refuse to say or do anything they feel not to be consonant with their own characters." [...] Film director François Truffaut ranked Cooper among [...] "the greatest actors" [...] because {{of his ability to}} deliver great performances [...] "without direction". This ability to project elements of his own personality onto his characters produced a continuity across his performances to the extent that critics and audiences were convinced that he was simply [...] "playing himself".|$|E
500|$|The nudity was {{optional}} for the performers. The French cast was [...] "the nudest" [...] of {{the foreign}} groups, while the London cast [...] "found nudity the hardest to achieve." [...] The Swedish cast was reluctant to disrobe, but in Copenhagen, the tribe thought the nudity too tame and decided to walk naked {{up and down the}} aisle during the show's prelude. In some early performances, the Germans played their scene behind a big sheet labeled [...] "CENSORED". Original Broadway cast member Natalie Mosco said, [...] "I was dead set against the nude scene at first, but I remembered my <b>acting</b> <b>teacher</b> having said that part of acting is being private in public. So I did it." [...] According to Melba Moore, [...] "It doesn't mean anything except what you want it to mean. We put so much value on clothing. .... It's like so much else people get uptight about." [...] Donna Summer, who was in the German production, said that [...] "it was not meant to be sexual. ... We stood naked to comment on the fact that society makes more of nudity than killing." [...] Rado said that [...] "being naked in front of an audience, you're baring your soul. [...] Not only the soul but the whole body was being exposed. It was very apt, very honest and almost necessary." ...|$|E
