Riblets are small flow-aligned grooves in the aircraft skin that damp turbulence and reduce skin friction; the mechanism of riblet drag reduction derives from the enhancement of turbulence-altering, transverse viscous forces by strong spanwise surface geometry gradients. LEBUs are thin plates or ribbons suspended in a turbulent boundary layer to sever or break up the large vortices that form the convoluted outer edge of the layer. Other turbulence-control {{techniques are}} discussed, including one that involves the injection of control vortices into the turbulent boundary layer to modify or substitute for large-eddy structures...|$|E

The methodology includes bibliographic research, interviews in depth and treatment of quantitative and qualitative data. The results show a very high dropout. In Spain, there is a significant number of children and adolescents in situation of poverty, which allows establishing a relationship between child and youth poverty and dropout.
