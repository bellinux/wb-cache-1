5|$|Freestyle {{skiing is}} one of the six skiing {{disciplines}} contested at the Winter Olympic Games, and one of the youngest. In 1924, the first Winter Olympics featured Nordic skiing disciplines (cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and Nordic combined), while alpine skiing was first contested in 1936. Only at the 1992 Winter Olympics, in Albertville, France, were freestyle skiing events first held as official medal events. Before that, freestyle skiing was contested at the 1988 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport, consisting of events {{for both men and women}} in three variants: moguls, aerials and ski ballet. In Albertville, moguls was the first-ever official freestyle skiing medal event; aerials and ski ballet were also held but still as demonstration events. The growing popularity of aerials convinced the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to <b>add</b> <b>this</b> freestyle discipline to the 1994 Winter Olympics official program. Moguls and aerials have thus been contested at every Winter Games since. Ski cross inclusion in the Winter Olympics program was approved at an IOC Executive Board meeting in November 2006, and the first events were held at the 2010 Winter Olympics.|$|E

25|$|In China, {{armies and}} {{provisions}} were counted using modular tallies of prime numbers. Unique numbers of troops {{and measures of}} rice appear as unique combinations of these tallies.

25|$|Between {{the first}} and second lines, the hundreds-column will contain three digits: the hundreds-digit of the ones-row, the tens-digit of the tens-row, and the ones-digit of the hundreds-row. Find the sum of these three digits, then if there is a carry-digit from the tens-column (written in {{superscript}} under the second line in the hundreds-column) then <b>add</b> <b>this</b> carry-digit as well. If the resulting sum has one digit then write it down under the second line in the hundreds-column; if it has two digits then write the last digit down under the line in the hundreds-column, and carry the first digit over to the thousands-column, writing it as a superscript to the yet-unwritten thousands-digit under the line.|$|E
25|$|To <b>add</b> <b>this</b> capability, they adapted {{a concept}} from the Coast Defense radars being {{developed}} by Butement. The idea was to use two antennas that are aimed in slightly different directions, but with their sensitive areas slightly overlapping down the centreline of the two. The result is a reception pattern where each of the antennas produces a maximum signal when the target is slightly {{to one side of}} the centreline, while a target located exactly in the middle would produce a slightly smaller but equal signal on both antennas. A switch is used to alternate the signals between the two antennas, sending them to the same receiver, amplifier and CRT. One of the signals is also sent through a delay, so its blip is drawn slightly offset.|$|E

25|$|Conventionally, {{capacitors}} {{are treated}} as if they generate reactive power and inductors as if they consume it. If a capacitor and an inductor are placed in parallel, then the currents flowing through the capacitor and the inductor tend to cancel rather than <b>add.</b> <b>This</b> is the fundamental mechanism for controlling the power factor in electric power transmission; capacitors (or inductors) are inserted in a circuit to partially compensate for reactive power 'consumed' by the load. Purely capacitive circuits supply reactive power with the current waveform leading the voltage waveform by 90degrees, while purely inductive circuits absorb reactive power with the current waveform lagging the voltage waveform by 90degrees. The result {{of this is that}} capacitive and inductive circuit elements tend to cancel each other out.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the first}} and second lines, the ten-thousands-column will contain either one or two digits: the hundreds-digit of the hundreds-column and (possibly) the thousands-digit of the tens-column. Find the sum of these digits (if the one in the tens-row is missing {{think of it as a}} 0), and if there is a carry-digit from the thousands-column (written in {{superscript}} under the second line in the ten-thousands-column) then <b>add</b> <b>this</b> carry-digit as well. If the resulting sum has one digit then write it down under the second line in the ten-thousands-column; if it has two digits then write the last digit down under the line in the ten-thousands-column, and carry the first digit over to the hundred-thousands-column, writing it as a superscript to the yet-unwritten hundred-thousands digit under the line. However, if the hundreds-row has no thousands-digit then do not write this carry-digit as a superscript, but in normal size, in the position of the hundred-thousands-digit under the second line, and the multiplication algorithm is over.|$|E

[...] Chris of Square Enix Music Online had similar feelings for the album, terming it a [...] "high-quality and surprising effort" [...] and [...] "an incredible improvement" [...] over the original soundtrack.

500|$|The {{creation}} of the ROH World Television Championship was announced via ROH's official website on January 20, 2010. An eight-man single elimination tournament was then planned to determine the inaugural champion. The tournament was to start on February 4 and conclude on February 6, 2010 at The Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the tapings of ROH's television program Ring of Honor Wrestling. Regarding the new championship addition, ROH President Cary Silkin said, [...] "We’ve been talking about adding a secondary championship for some time. Not only will this give the athletes of Ring of Honor another tremendous goal to work towards, it will also give our great partner, HDNet, a championship that {{is sure to be}} defended on the television program.

Although he wrote that Most Wanted [...] "isn't a terrible album by any means, it's not {{particularly}} a good one, since Duff's two pop albums [...] have distinctive personalities that don't necessarily mesh together , and are both more fun than this." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com noted that the three new songs [...] "seem to be marking time instead of finding a new direction" [...] but said that [...] " [...] remaining bulk of this collection is strong." [...] Anthony Miccio, from the Baltimore City Paper, wrote that the album [...] "doesn't signify the closure of a brief career" [...] but is [...] "meant to satisfy an audience that won't be offended by the opportunity to buy their favorite songs again and again." [...] He noted that Duff's voice was not strong enough and stated that the [...] "rock tracks are surprisingly sluggish." [...] Talia Kraines of BBC Music commented that [...] "... there isn't enough here to warrant a purchase if you're already the owner of her back catalogue. But if you're after your first taste of Duff-flavoured pop to listen to in the background as you do your homework, then this album can do no harm." ...|$|E
500|$|A main {{objective}} planned for The King of Fighters '95 was to introduce Iori properly as Kyo's rival. Creators have stated Iori's personality, {{and other aspects}} of his character such as his phrases and unique moves, [...] "broke the mold for characters in fighting games at that time" [...] Like Kyo, several aspects of Iori, including his surname and abilities, were designed to relate him to the Yamata no Orochi legend, which was the inspiration for the plot. After observing fan reactions at initial location testing for King of Fighters '95, several staff members predicted that Iori would be popular on his release. One of them was happy that at an event for The King of Fighters XIII on March 25, 2010, several fans reminded him that it was Iori's birthday according to his official profile. Iori is a berserker due to the Orochi demon blood within him. This version of him, officially named [...] "Orochi Iori", is hinted to have existed before his debut in The King of Fighters '97 as one of the game's mid bosses. This form of Iori was designed specifically to overpower other characters easily. Series' flagship director, Toyohisa Tanabe, states that the staff was initially reluctant to <b>add</b> <b>this</b> version of Iori to the series' roster—worried about fans' reactions—but did so to add more impact to the Orochi saga's climax. He was particularly pleased to see surprised reactions from female fans to this form during KOF '97s location testing. Another minor development of his character was his change of [...] "most valued possession/valued treasure" [...] information. A girlfriend was also listed more than once, specifically in The King of Fighters '95, The King of Fighters '99, and The King of Fighters 2000. However, starting with The King of Fighters 2001 and every entry after, the space is listed as [...] "None". The SNK staff commented that it is curious that he does not have a girlfriend anymore.|$|E
