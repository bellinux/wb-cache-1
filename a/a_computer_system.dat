5|$|Convicted {{computer}} {{criminals are}} people who are caught and convicted of computer crimes such as breaking into computers or computer networks. Computer crime can be broadly defined as criminal activity involving information technology infrastructure, including illegal access (unauthorized access), illegal interception (by technical means of non-public transmissions of computer data to, from or within <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>system),</b> data interference (unauthorized damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration or suppression of computer data), systems interference (interfering with the functioning of <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>system</b> by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data), misuse of devices, forgery (or identity theft) and electronic fraud.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>computer</b> <b>systems</b> analyst is <b>an</b> {{occupation}} {{in the field}} of information technology. <b>A</b> <b>computer</b> <b>systems</b> analyst works to solve problems related to computer technology. Many analysts set up new <b>computer</b> <b>systems,</b> both the hardware and software, add new software applications to increase computer productivity. Others act as system developers or system architects, but most analysts specialize in a specific type of system such as business systems, accounting systems, financial systems, or scientific systems.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the pros and}} cons of using a functional language for implementing <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> algebra <b>system.</b> The contributions of the paper are twofold. Firstly, we discuss some language–centered design aspects of <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> algebra <b>system</b> — the “language unity” concept. Secondly, we provide an implementation of a fast polynomial multiplication algorithm, which is one of the core elements of <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> algebra <b>system.</b> The goal of the paper is to test the feasibility of an implementation of (some elements of) <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> algebra <b>system</b> in <b>a</b> modern functional language...|$|R
5|$|The goal of {{computer}} forensics is {{to explain the}} current state of a digital artifact; such as <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>system,</b> storage medium or electronic document. The discipline usually covers computers, embedded systems (digital devices with rudimentary computing power and onboard memory) and static memory (such as USB pen drives).|$|E
5|$|A {{symmetric}} multiprocessor (SMP) is <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>system</b> {{with multiple}} identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus. Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs {{generally do not}} comprise more than 32processors. Because of {{the small size of}} the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to safety design, new security measures will be implemented. All vehicles will be screened for radioactive materials and other potentially dangerous objects before {{they enter the}} site through the underground road. Four hundred closed-circuit surveillance cameras will be placed {{in and around the}} site, with live camera feeds being continuously monitored by the NYPD. <b>A</b> <b>computer</b> <b>system</b> will use video-analytic computer software, designed to detect potential threats, such as unattended bags, and retrieve images based on descriptions of terrorists or other criminal suspects. New York City and Port Authority police will patrol the site.|$|E

All services are contracted with Sonda IT.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Storm Prediction Center, National Severe Storms Laboratory and National Weather Service Norman Forecast Office {{moved their}} {{respective}} operations into the newly constructed National Weather Center, near Westheimer Airport. Since the agency's relocation to Norman, the 557th Weather Wing at Offutt Air Force Base would assume control of issuing the Storm Prediction Center's severe weather {{products in the}} event that the SPC is no longer able to issue them {{in the event of an}} outage (such as <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>system</b> failure or building-wide power disruption) or emergency (such as an approaching strong tornadic circulation or tornado on the ground) affecting the Norman campus; on April 1, 2009, the SPC reassigned responsibilities for issuing the center's products in such situations to the 15th Operational Weather Squadron based out of Scott Air Force Base.|$|E
5|$|In Herring v. United States, , Ginsburg dissented to the Court's {{decision}} not to suppress evidence due to a police officer's failure to update <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>system.</b> In contrast to Justice Roberts' emphasis on suppression {{as a means to}} deter police misconduct, Ginsburg took a more robust view on the use of suppression as a remedy for a violation of a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Ginsburg viewed suppression as a way to prevent the government from profiting from mistakes, and therefore as a remedy to preserve judicial integrity and respect civil rights. She also rejected Roberts' assertion that suppression would not deter mistakes, contending making police pay a high price for mistakes would encourage them to take greater care.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1980s crimes {{involving}} {{computers were}} dealt with using existing laws. The first computer crimes were {{recognized in the}} 1978 Florida Computer Crimes Act, which included legislation against the unauthorized modification or deletion of data on <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>system.</b> Over {{the next few years}} the range of computer crimes being committed increased, and laws were passed to deal with issues of copyright, privacy/harassment (e.g., cyber bullying, cyber stalking, and online predators) and child pornography. It was not until the 1980s that federal laws began to incorporate computer offences. Canada was the first country to pass legislation in 1983. This was followed by the US Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 1986, Australian amendments to their crimes acts in 1989 and the British Computer Misuse Act in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The third {{multiplayer}} mode is the Combat Simulator, involving {{up to four}} human {{players and}} eight computer-controlled players. Again, a split-screen is used if more than one human is playing. If three or four humans play, the screen is divided into quarters, with one quarter left blank if necessary. Players enter the game unarmed and {{with a certain amount}} of health. Weapons and ammunition are placed around the level in preset positions. Once a player is killed, they are regenerated elsewhere in the level, once again unarmed. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from the traditional deathmatch mode, where players score points by killing their respective enemies, to objective-based games, such as Capture the Flag or King of the Hill. Other scenarios include Hold the Briefcase, where players must take a briefcase and survive with it for as long as possible, and Hacker Central, a gametype where players score points by hacking <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>system</b> using a data uplink. Aspects of each game can be customised, including the chosen map, the weapons available, and the winning conditions. Players can also be grouped into teams or compete individually. In a team game, the players can optionally be shown coloured according to their team. Each game can be customised to a greater degree than was possible in GoldenEye 007s multiplayer mode, such as free weapons selection and placement of shields.|$|E

25|$|The trusted {{computing}} base (TCB) of <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>system</b> is the set of all hardware, firmware, and/or {{software components}} that are critical to its security, {{in the sense that}} bugs or vulnerabilities occurring inside the TCB might jeopardize the security properties of the entire system. By contrast, parts of <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>system</b> outside the TCB must not be able to misbehave {{in a way that would}} leak any more privileges than are granted to them in accordance to the security policy.|$|E
