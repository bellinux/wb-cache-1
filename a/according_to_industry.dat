5|$|<b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>industry</b> sources, Capcom's {{reversal}} on GameCube exclusivity, {{particularly with}} Resident Evil 4, was a betrayal that soured relations between Capcom and Nintendo for several years. After this early pulling of Capcom support, the GameCube {{went on to}} sell 22 million units, less than the Nintendo 64's 33 million units and {{only a fraction of}} the PlayStation 2's 155 million units. Though Resident Evil 4 was eventually ported to Nintendo's Wii in 2007, it also received a high-definition re-release for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2011. The 2002 GameCube remake of Resident Evil and Resident Evil Zero also received remasters for newer consoles in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Super Smash Bros. Brawl was released in 2008, featuring third party characters like Solid Snake from Konami and Sonic the Hedgehog from Sega as a selling point. Kotaku reported on a rumor that Nintendo refused to include a character from Capcom as a direct result of Resident Evil 4s multi-platform release. Years later, Capcom's own Mega Man appeared as a playable character in the next game in the series, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.|$|E
5|$|Causeway Bay Books (銅鑼灣書店), {{located in}} Causeway Bay, Hong Kong, {{was founded in}} 1994 by Lam Wing-kee. It is one of about 110 {{independent}} Hong Kong bookshops that rent out space in upstairs locations to avoid high rents at street level. The bookstore sells a number of political books that are considered sensitive and banned in mainland China. Freedom of speech in Hong Kong is protected under Basic Law Article 27, and these independent publishers thrive as they cater predominantly to people interested in the machinations of mainland politics. The bookstore has become popular amongst mainland Chinese tourists for this reason. In 2014, the bookstore was sold to Mighty Current Media Company Limited (巨流傳媒有限公司), a publishing house. During {{the time of the}} disappearances, the company had three shareholders: Gui Minhai, Sophie Choi and Lui Bo. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>industry</b> sources, Mighty Current is a prolific publisher with a number of publishing subsidiaries, and this group may be responsible for 30 to 60 percent of the output of salacious books about Chinese political figures that are widely available at newsstands and in book stores, including one at Hong Kong International Airport.|$|E
5|$|According to Andrew Hampp of Billboard, the pre-order for Rebel Heart {{received}} a strong commercial response after its release to iTunes Stores around the world. Pre-orders were estimated at around 50,000 to 60,000 copies, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>industry</b> prognosticators. Rebel Heart debuted at number {{two on the}} Billboard 200 chart with 121,000 album equivalent units, behind the soundtrack of the TV series Empire. While it was the best-selling album of the week—ranking number one on Billboards Top Album Sales chart with pure album sales of 116,000 copies (96% of overall units)—it fell behind the soundtrack {{when it came to}} streaming and track equivalent album units, with just over 1,000 and 4,000 units respectively. It became Madonna's 21st top-ten album, but was her first studio release not to debut atop the chart since 1998's Ray of Light. Rebel Hearts concert tour bundle amounted to less than 10,000 copies compared to the 180,000 copies sold for her previous album, MDNA. The release also prompted Madonna to debut at number seven on the Billboard Artist 100 chart, moving up by 2,919% in overall Artist 100 points and gaining 31% in social media activity. In Canada, Rebel Heart debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart with 18,000 copies sold in the first week, making it her seventh number-one there during the SoundScan era. The next week, the album dropped 19 places on the Billboard 200, while in Canada it dropped only one position. Billboard reported that the sales dropped by 78% to 26,000 units, a reflection of the high pre-orders during first week. The album was present for a total of 11 weeks on the chart, and ranked at number 151 on the Billboard 200 year end chart for 2015. As of December 2016, the album has sold 238,000 copies in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E

500|$|<b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>industry</b> observers, the {{introduction}} of the Lexus LS reshaped Toyota's image from that of an [...] "econobox" [...] manufacturer to the builder of an automotive standard bearer. This stood in contrast to the predictions of early detractors, including rival manufacturers who dismissed Toyota as incapable of producing a competitive luxury vehicle. Japanese contemporaries from the luxury divisions of Honda (Acura) and Nissan (Infiniti) had differing degrees of success. Honda had entered into a joint venture with Britain's Austin Rover Group in November 1981, launching Project XX with an Austin Rover–Honda XX letter of intent to replace the Rover SD1 with the Rover 800 and to provide a midsize, V6-powered luxury sedan for Honda, called the Honda Legend. Marketed as the Acura Legend in the U.S., the sedan initially sold well, but subsequent models (renamed Acura RL) performed below sales expectations. Launched by Nissan in December 1989, the V8-powered Infiniti Q45 closely rivaled the LS 400 in specifications and price, but was unsuccessful in sales (attributed to unconventional styling and marketing), leading to its discontinuation in 2006. The success of the Lexus LS became a test case for mainstream manufacturers targeting upscale segments. By investing in a separate marque, Toyota was able to avoid the stigma attached to a mass-market brand's charging premium prices. The effect of the LS 400 on the automotive industry led Automobile Magazine to add the sedan to its [...] "24 Most Important Vehicles of the 20th Century" [...] list in 1996.|$|E
