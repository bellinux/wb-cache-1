After graduation, he served as the law clerk for <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> Supreme Court justice Hugo L. Black, cultivating a friendship that would last until Black’s death in 1971. Frank spent the remainder of World War II in Washington D. C. as the assistant to the Secretary of the Interior and an <b>assistant</b> to the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorney</b> General. He received his S. J. D. from Yale in 1946 and he joined {{the faculty of the}} Indiana University, Bloomington School of Law. In 1949, he published Mr. Justice Black: the Man and His Opinions, and he joined the faculty at the Yale Law School. In 1954, he left academia and returned to the private practice of law with the Phoenix, Arizona law firm of Lewis and Roca. He would remain with Lewis and Roca until his death in 2002. John Frank was a prolific author. In addition to Mr. Justice Black, he also wrote Inside Justice Hugo L. Black: the Letters (published in 2000) which contained the correspondence he had with Justice Black from 1946 to 1971. Other books included Marble Palace: The Supreme Court in American Life (1958); Lincoln as a Lawyer (1961); The Warren Court (1964); Justice Daniel Dissenting: a Biography of Peter V.

In 1954, he advised Thurgood Marshall before his appearance before the Court to argue Brown vs. Board of Education, which declared school segregation unconstitutional. In 1966, he represented Ernesto Miranda in his case, Miranda v. Arizona, which established police procedures for handling criminal suspects. This case gave rise to the “Miranda rights” that police recite to arrested individuals. He also took up several political causes during his life, including seeking the desegregation of law schools in the 1950 ’s; opposing the nomination of Robert Bork to the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> Supreme Court in 1987; and advising Anita Hill in her testimony in 1991 against <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.

It then explores the historical development {{of the role of the}} <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys,</b> their relationship to the Attorney General and the Department of Justice, and their role in the contemporary federal criminal justice system. With that background, the article {{considers the}} question whether there should be a fundamental change in the role and character of the position of <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorney.</b> It concludes that a career or civil service role for <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys</b> is neither politically feasible nor desirable. Rather, the presidential appointment of <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys,</b> with approval by the Senate, provides a desirable counterweight to Main Justice, both by creating separate spheres of political influence and by allowing for decentralization of federal power. It argues that there is real value in a structure that delegates federal prosecutorial power to local districts, reinforcing federalism and allowing federal law to be adapted to different conditions. Although the advantages of political appointments for the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys</b> outweigh the disadvantages, there are still reasons for concern. The article evaluates four mechanisms that have been proposed to moderate the effect of partisan politics at the appointment stage and the effect of improper partisan pressure that may be exerted on <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorneys</b> by the executive branch, Congress or local political leaders. Three of the mechanisms are identified as promising alternatives to an impracticable and undesirable reconfiguration of the Department...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 requires that GAO annually (1) {{determine the extent to}} which lobbyists can demonstrate compliance with disclosure requirements, (2) identify any challenges that lobbyists report to compliance, and (3) describe the resources and authorities available to the U. S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia (the Office), and the efforts the Office has made to improve its enforcement of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 as amended (LDA). This is GAO's fourth report under the mandate. GAO reviewed a stratified random sample of 100 lobbying disclosure reports filed from the fourth quarter of calendar year 2009 through the third quarter of calendar year 2010. GAO also selected two random samples totaling 160 reports of federal political campaign contributions from year-end 2009 and midyear 2010. This methodology allowed GAO to generalize to the population of 55, 282 disclosure reports with $ 5, 000 or more in lobbying activity. GAO also met with officials from the Office regarding efforts to focus resources on lobbyists who fail to comply. GAO provided a draft of this report to the Attorney General for review and comment. The <b>Assistant</b> <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Attorney</b> for the District of Columbia responded on behalf of the Attorney General that the Department of Justice had no comments on the draft of this report. ...|$|E

In a sample of 570 attorneys in office from 1969 to 2000, the length of prison sentences is positively related to subsequent favorable career outcomes for <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>attorneys.</b> In contrast, conviction rates {{do not appear to}} affect the careers of <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>attorneys.</b> These results are consistent with longer total prison sentences' being personally beneficial to prosecutors, and prosecutors' maximizing the length of prison sentences. Overall, the results suggest that sentence length, as opposed to convictions rates, is the relevant performance metric. Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
