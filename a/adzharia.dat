50|$|Armenia, {{built in}} 1928 at Baltic Shipyards in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), {{was one of}} four Adzharia-class {{passenger}} liners specifically designed for use on the Black Sea. They were the first passenger ships to be built in the newly formed Soviet Union. Armenia was a mid-sized vessel capable of carrying 1,000 tons of cargo as well as about 550 passengers in first-, second-, and third-class accommodations. On short trips it could carry 4-500 more on deck. Her shallow draft (5.5 meters) allowed access to the shallow-water ports of the Crimean Peninsula. Throughout the 1930s she and her sister ships - <b>Adzharia,</b> Abkhazia, and Ukraina - reliably ferried passengers, mail, and cargo between Black Sea ports such as Odessa, Mariupol, Sevastopol, Yalta, and Batum.|$|E
