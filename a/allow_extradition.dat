Later, Brazilian Minister of Justice Tarso Genro granted him the status of {{political}} refugee, in a controversial decision which was much criticized in Italy, whereas Brazilian and international press opinion was more divided. On 5 February 2009, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in support of Italy and held a minute of silence in memory to Battisti's victims. On 18 November 2009, the Brazilian Supreme Court considered the refugee status illegal and allowed extradition, but also stated that the Brazilian constitution gives the president personal powers to deny the extradition if he chooses to, effectively putting the final decision {{in the hands of}} Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

2500|$|The goal of {{maritime}} security operations is [...] "actively to deter, disrupt and suppress piracy {{in order to}} protect global {{maritime security}} and secure freedom of navigation for the benefit of all nations", and pirates are often detained, interrogated, disarmed, and released. With millions of dollars at stake, pirates have little incentive to stop. In Finland, one case involved pirates who had been captured and whose boat was sunk. As the pirates attacked a vessel of Singapore, not Finland, and are not themselves EU or Finnish citizens, they were not prosecuted. A further complication in many cases, including this one, is that many countries do not <b>allow</b> <b>extradition</b> of people to jurisdictions where they may be sentenced to death or torture.|$|E
50|$|On April 11, an AUC {{spokesman}} repeated {{their claims}} that the current proposal for amnesty was too harsh primarily because it still <b>allowed</b> <b>extradition</b> for drug charges.|$|R
50|$|As the Croatian Constitution {{prevents}} extradition of Croatian {{citizens to}} other countries, Perković {{continued to live}} freely in Croatia even after the 2009 arrest warrant, {{as it had been}} issued by Germany. However, the warrant was to become legally binding for Croatian authorities in 2013, as the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) issued by Germany for Perković came into force with Croatia's accession to the European Union on 1 July 2013, <b>allowing</b> <b>extradition</b> of wanted individuals to fellow EU states.|$|R
5000|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} of the Extradition Act 2003 in the UK in respect of the cases of Gary McKinnon and the NatWest Three. In particular, the Act has been criticised for reducing the level of evidence required for extradition from the UK to the U.S. from prima facie evidence to [...] "reasonable suspicion", and for <b>allowing</b> <b>extradition</b> to proceed {{on the basis of}} offences in U.S. rather than UK law. In addition, the standard of proof required for extradition from the U.S. to the UK is different, in accordance with the Fourth Amendment - the standard of [...] "probable cause".|$|R
50|$|In 1996, Mexico {{changed its}} policy to <b>allow</b> <b>extradition</b> of its {{citizens}} to the United States to face trial. Previously, the Constitution had forbidden its citizens to be extradited.|$|E
50|$|In June 2000 he {{was arrested}} in Bastia, Corsica. He however avoided the {{extradition}} to Italy because the French law does not recognize default sentences; further, Swiss law does not <b>allow</b> <b>extradition</b> for its citizens.|$|E
50|$|The Israeli and French {{authorities}} were in close communication {{with each other}} on how to proceed, as the French law of extradition, like Israel's, does not <b>allow</b> <b>extradition</b> of nationals, except to countries of the European Union, {{to bring them to}} justice.|$|E

5|$|Kirchner {{also changed}} the <b>extradition</b> policy, <b>allowing</b> <b>extradition</b> for people prosecuted abroad and not facing charges in Argentina. He also {{supported}} the requests by {{human rights organizations}} to turn the former detention centers into memorials for the disappeared. Argentina became a signatory of the UN Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity in 2003. A creative interpretation of the convention by the courts allowed them to circumvent the statutory limitations to crimes committed decades in the past, and also the ex post facto applicability of laws that were not in force {{at the time of}} the crimes.|$|R
5000|$|Death penalty: Many jurisdictions, such as Australia, Canada, Macao, New Zealand, South Africa, {{and most}} European nations except Belarus, will not <b>allow</b> <b>extradition</b> if {{the death penalty}} may be imposed on the suspect unless they are assured that the death {{sentence}} will not be passed or carried out.|$|E

The country is the second largest contributor for production of Total after Nigeria. According to Angolan media, France and Portugal will <b>allow</b> <b>extradition</b> of leaders of the separatist movement {{in the wake of}} the 2010 attacks on Togo's football team for which FLEC claimed the responsibility.|$|E
50|$|Because Mireles, {{who was in}} the United States legally, went to {{his home}} country of Mexico, there could have been added {{complications}} to the case. Before extraditing a suspect, Mexico requires that authorities submit the most serious charges that the suspect could face, and will not <b>allow</b> <b>extradition</b> of someone who could face the death penalty. The maximum penalty he could face was life in prison without the possibility of parole. On June 26, 2009, the Associated Press reported that Mireles was back in the US following extradition.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, the six Libyans {{were put}} on trial in the Paris Assize Court for the bombing of UTA Flight 772. Because Gaddafi would not <b>allow</b> their <b>extradition</b> to France, the six were tried in {{absentia}} and were convicted.|$|R

5000|$|In January 2010 Mr Justice Mitting granted McKinnon {{a further}} {{judicial}} review of the decision of Home Secretary Alan Johnson to <b>allow</b> McKinnon’s <b>extradition.</b> Mitting distinguished two issues which were arguable, the first being whether Professor Turk's opinion that McKinnon would certainly commit suicide if extradited means that the Home Secretary must refuse extradition under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (which prevents a public authority from acting in a way incompatible with convention rights). The second was whether Professor Turk's opinion was a fundamental change to the circumstances that the courts had previously considered and ruled upon. Mitting ruled that if the answer to both questions was [...] "Yes", then it was arguable {{that it would be}} unlawful to <b>allow</b> the <b>extradition.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In late 2006, former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko was {{poisoned}} in London by radioactive metalloid, Polonium-210 {{and died}} three weeks later. Britain requested the extradition of Andrei Lugovoy from Russia to face charges over Litvinenko's death, Russia refused, stating their constitution does not <b>allow</b> <b>extradition</b> of their citizens to foreign countries. Britain then expelled four Russian diplomats, shortly followed by Russia expelling four British diplomats, the dispute then continued to escalate {{over the following}} months. As of 19 May 2008 the head of Counter-Terrorism at the British Crown Prosecution Service, Sue Hemming, said: [...] "The extradition request is still current.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, the Brazilian {{government}} decided to apply these exceptions broadly, and in practice it only revokes Brazilian nationality {{if the person}} formally requests so. However, in 2013 the Brazilian government revoked the nationality of a Brazilian citizen who had naturalized in the United States, to extradite her to that country (the Brazilian constitution does not <b>allow</b> <b>extradition</b> of its own citizens). The decision was confirmed by the Supreme Federal Court in 2016, but as of May 2017 it is pending further appeal. It is unclear whether this case means {{a change in the}} Brazilian government's decision to allow dual nationality in practice, or only an exception due to its unique circumstances.|$|E

50|$|The {{questions}} {{involved are}} often complex {{when the country}} from which suspects are to be extradited is a democratic country with a rule of law. Typically, in such countries, the final decision to extradite lies with the national executive (prime minister, president or equivalent). However, such countries typically <b>allow</b> <b>extradition</b> defendants recourse to the law, with multiple appeals. These may significantly slow down procedures. On the one hand, this may lead to unwarranted international difficulties, as the public, politicians and journalists from the requesting country will ask their executive {{to put pressure on}} the executive of the country from which extradition is to take place, while that executive may not in fact have the authority to deport the suspect or criminal on their own. On the other hand, certain delays, or the unwillingness of the local prosecution authorities to present a good extradition case before the court on behalf of the requesting state, may possibly result from the unwillingness of the country's executive to extradite.|$|E

2500|$|Sogavare faced much {{criticism}} from the former Howard government for his refusal to <b>allow</b> the <b>extradition</b> of Moti. Sogavare and Sir Michael Somare stated that they considered that the Australian Government were politically persecuting Moti and that a new trial was uncalled for as the issue was [...] "unconditionally concluded in Vanuatu in 1999" [...] and the Australian government had failed to produce any new evidence to justify an extradition.|$|R

5000|$|In April 2007, The Times {{reported}} that British lawyer Tim Osborne {{was accused of}} a criminal offence by the Russian Government. Osborne was accused under articles 160 and 174 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation of embezzlement, misappropriation of assets and money laundering. At that time, Osborne was a managing director of GML (formerly Group Menatep), an investment vehicle and the biggest shareholder in Yukos. On 10 May 2007, Osborne complained in written evidence submitted by GML Limited that [...] "the Russian accusations limit his ability to travel and discharge his fiduciary duties to manage GML's claim under the ECT. They further damage his personal and professional reputation and ability to carry on his legal practice." [...] Osborne further demanded that all Council of Europe member states should reject Russian extradition requests and mentioned that in two rulings in Bow Street Magistrates' Court on extradition requests for individuals connected to Yukos, Judge Timothy Workman refused to <b>allow</b> <b>extradition</b> {{on the basis that}} the requests were politically motivated. The accusation against Osborne and some officers were published on the website of the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office in 2007, shortly after the Yukos shareholders had filed a $103 billion suit against Russia at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague for compensation from the Russian government for alleged expropriation of its investment. The Hague claim falls under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), an international agreement that in part regulates investments in the energy industry, which Russia signed but never ratified.|$|E
40|$|Extradition {{as an act}} of {{international}} cooperation for the repression of criminal activities of the criminal offenders is one of the various models whereby one sovereign state delivers up the alleged accused criminals found within its jurisdiction, on demand, to another sovereign state, so that they might be dealt with according to the penal laws. Extradition has evolved among states because they are vitally interested in the repression of crimes and punishment of criminals who violate their national laws and thus disturb the general peace of the society. This article aims to describe the problems with which extradition is faced, especially with the obligation to extradite and with the obligation {{to take care of her}} own citizens in situations when the Constitution does not <b>allow</b> <b>extradition</b> of own nationals and in the absence of an extradition treaty...|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of international cooperation, the Republic of Albania has responded positively to cooperation in penal field and in particular regarding extradition.

This agreement follows the European Convention on Extradition, 1957 and the European Convention on legal assistance for penal cases, 1959. According to the above agreement Republic of Albania <b>allow</b> <b>extradition</b> of its citizens {{on the basis of}} the principle of reciprocity. The purpose of this paper is treating extradition, not just as a process of transfer / delivery of a place in another, a person convicted of, or who is subject to penal prosecution as a legal process that combines rights and obligations and to highlight some problems in the extradition process...|$|E
50|$|The Portuguese Constitution (adopted in 1976) {{expressly}} forbids {{the death}} penalty (art. 24, § 2) and life imprisonment (art. 30, § 1).

Unless binding assurances are given that the suspect will not be sentenced to either death penalty or life imprisonment, the extradition must be rejected.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, capital {{punishment}} {{is a legal}} form of punishment, whereas all European member states have fully abolished it and consider its use to {{be a violation of}} fundamental human rights.
