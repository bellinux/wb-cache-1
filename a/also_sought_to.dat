Manchester United <b>also</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> be {{the first team to}} retain the European Cup since Milan in 1990.

The party also lent much space to discussing the AIDS virus, which it put {{in the context of}} a moral crisis and moral relativism that it considered to only be solvable by returning to traditional morality.|$|E

In 1980, ZANU-PF used Nigerian funds {{to set up the}} Mass Media Trust, through which they bought out a South African company that owned most of Zimbabwe's newspapers. The white editors of these newspapers were sacked and replaced by government appointees. These media outlets subsequently became a source of the party's propaganda.|$|E
5|$|According to Aonuma, the team's {{starting}} point for development was the Wii version of Twilight Princess: feeling they had not fully realized their goal of creating a vast and realistic world with Twilight Princess, they used their previous work {{as a foundation for}} the next title. They <b>also</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> create a memorable experience equivalent to , by that time considered the series' most memorable title. Development lasted around five years, and according to series producer Shigeru Miyamoto, the game's budget was considered quite high for a Nintendo project. The development time was initially estimated at three years, but difficulties and changes in the game's development extended development time by a further two years: despite this, Miyamoto felt that this was not wasted development time as the first two years went into experimentation. By June 2011, the game was complete aside from fine tuning and balancing its mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{changes to}} the stadium itself, Rangers have <b>also</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> develop land around Ibrox. In {{partnership}} with the Las Vegas Sands corporation, the club received outline planning permission from Glasgow City Council {{for the development of}} land adjoining Ibrox as the home of a super casino. The casino was planned to be accompanied by a Rangers-themed leisure complex. Britain's Casino Advisory Panel reviewed bids from eight short-listed cities, including Glasgow, and in 2007 awarded the first licence to Manchester. There is no immediate prospect of the Ibrox proposal being resurrected, as Gordon Brown dropped the plans for super casinos soon after becoming Prime Minister. Rangers were given approval by Glasgow City Council in October 2008 to purchase land around Ibrox and redevelop the area with hotel and retail outlets. This scheme stalled, however, as regulations constrained what could be built in the area.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{was unusual}} at {{the time for a}} {{national}} candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He <b>also</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> boost his chances in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.|$|E
