Administratively, St Kilda was part of the parish of Harris in the traditional county of Inverness-shire. Today it is incorporated in the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles) unitary authority.|$|E

50|$|Bomb Gem: This {{looks like}} a mine, and it only appears in Puzzle and Finity mode. When a gem <b>is</b> <b>matched,</b> {{the number on the}} Bomb goes down by one. When a gem <b>is</b> <b>matched</b> when the Bomb gem is at 0, the Bomb Gem explodes like a Power Gem. The gem can't <b>be</b> <b>matched</b> but when {{destroyed}} by a Power Gem or a Hypercube, it explodes.|$|R

5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer <b>are</b> <b>matched</b> within the coherence {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E

40|$|Object <b>matching</b> <b>is</b> a {{fundamental}} problem that arises in numerous information integration scenarios.

25|$|Adjectival participles {{have all}} the {{adjectival}} characteristics: three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), pronominal forms, mostly identical declension and sometimes even degrees of comparison. Their primary function is to describe a nominal part of speech (usually a noun), like any adjective would in their position, hence they <b>are</b> <b>matched</b> by gender, case and number with the noun they are describing.|$|E
25|$|In 1985 Simon Baron-Cohen, Alan M. Leslie and Uta Frith {{suggested}} {{that children with}} autism do not employ Theory of Mind and {{suggested that}} autistic children have particular difficulties with tasks requiring the child to understand another person's beliefs. These difficulties persist when children <b>are</b> <b>matched</b> for verbal skills and have been taken as a key feature of autism.|$|E
25|$|Defenses {{work best}} against the {{offensive}} weapon {{with which they}} <b>are</b> <b>matched.</b> A defense mechanism used against a mismatched attack is diminished to the square root of the defense value (with a minimum of 1).

25|$|Input current: Due to biasing {{requirements}} or leakage, a {{small amount}} of current (typically ~10 nanoamperes for bipolar op-amps, tens of picoamperes (pA) for JFET input stages, and only a few pA for MOSFET input stages) flows into the inputs. When large resistors or sources with high output impedances are used in the circuit, these small currents can produce large unmodeled voltage drops. If the input currents <b>are</b> <b>matched,</b> and the impedance looking out of both inputs <b>are</b> <b>matched,</b> then the voltages produced at each input will be equal. Because the operational amplifier operates on the difference between its inputs, these matched voltages will have no effect. It is more common for the input currents to be slightly mismatched. The difference is called input offset current, and even with matched resistances a small offset voltage (different from the input offset voltage below) can be produced. This offset voltage can create offsets or drifting in the operational amplifier.|$|E
25|$|An {{object is}} an entity that is {{represented}} by information in a database. User queries <b>are</b> <b>matched</b> against the database information. Depending on the application the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images, audio, mind maps or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata.|$|E
25|$|In Lithuanian {{language}} adjectives {{have three}} declensions {{determined by the}} singular and plural nominative case inflections. Adjectives <b>are</b> <b>matched</b> with nouns in terms of numbers, genders, and cases. Unlike nouns, which have two genders – masculine and feminine, adjectives have three (except -is, -ė adjectives), but the neuter adjectives (the third example in the table) have only one form, are not inflected. The neuter gender is formed simply by eliminating the last consonant -s from the masculine gender forms.|$|E

Friends of High Park Zoo was formed after Toronto City Council voted to cancel funding for the zoo. The organization has announced a master plan of improvements it hopes to make to the zoo.|$|E
25|$|When declaring a function, a {{programmer}} can specify {{for one or}} more parameters a default value. Doing so allows the parameters with defaults to optionally be omitted when the function is called, {{in which case the}} default arguments will be used. When a function is called with fewer arguments than there are declared parameters, explicit arguments <b>are</b> <b>matched</b> to parameters in left-to-right order, with any unmatched parameters {{at the end of the}} parameter list being assigned their default arguments. In many cases, specifying default arguments in a single function declaration is preferable to providing overloaded function definitions with different numbers of parameters.|$|E
25|$|Porsche's Composite Ceramic Brakes (PCCB) are siliconized carbon fiber, {{with very}} high {{temperature}} capability, a 50% weight reduction over iron discs (therefore reducing the unsprung {{weight of the}} vehicle), {{a significant reduction in}} dust generation, substantially increased maintenance intervals, and enhanced durability in corrosive environments over conventional iron discs. Found on some of their more expensive models, it is also an optional brake for all street Porsches at added expense. It is generally recognized by the bright yellow paintwork on the aluminum six-piston calipers that <b>are</b> <b>matched</b> with the discs. The discs are internally vented much like cast-iron ones, and cross-drilled.|$|E

30|$|The {{observations}} of Case I could {{be divided into}} two parts: the image coordinates from GCPs and the ones from keypoints. The latter one could be further classified according to their corresponding number of overlapping images. For example, some keypoints might only <b>be</b> <b>matched</b> in two images, while others <b>were</b> <b>matched</b> in three images. The MDBs from different types had different characteristics. MDBs could be divided by three groups: MDBs for the image coordinates of GCPs (Type A), MDBs for the image coordinates of the keypoints that <b>were</b> <b>matched</b> in three images (Type B), and MDBs for the image coordinates of the keypoints that <b>were</b> <b>matched</b> in two images (Type C).
