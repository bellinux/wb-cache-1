Using Gaussian first-order ray tracing calculations, {{we examine the}} contribution that ocular <b>axial</b> <b>distances</b> make to the accommodation response. Further, the influence of age and ametropia are also considered. The data show that all changes in <b>axial</b> <b>distances</b> during accommodation reduce the accommodation response, with the reduction in anterior chamber depth contributing most to this overall attenuation. Although the total power loss due to the changes in <b>axial</b> <b>distances</b> remained constant with increasing age, hyperopes exhibited less accommodation than myopes.

40|$|Measurements of the {{structure}} of a swirl-stabilized, reacting spray are presented. The configuration consisted of a research air-assist atomizer located in the center surrounded by a coflowing air stream. Both the air assist and coflow streams had swirl imparted to them in the same direction with 45 degree angle swirlers. The fuel and air entered the combustor at ambient temperature and the combustor was operated in an unconfined environment. The gas phase was seeded with aluminum oxide particles in order to obtain velocity measurements. Velocity measurements for the gas phase are reported for both an isothermal, single-phase case without drops and a reacting spray case at <b>axial</b> <b>distances</b> from 2. 5 to 350 mm downstream of the nozzle. Both mean and fluctuating values are reported. Heptane fuel was used for all the experiments. Drop size and velocity, and drop number flux are also reported for five <b>axial</b> <b>distances</b> downstream. Both mean and fluctuating values are reported for the drops. The measurements were performed using a two-component phase/Doppler particle analyzer. Profiles across the entire flowfield where velocities were significant are presented.

40|$|Accurate {{distance}} measurement in 3 D confocal microscopy {{is important for}} quantitative analysis, volume visualization and image restoration. However, <b>axial</b> <b>distances</b> can be distorted by both the point spread function (PSF) and by a refractive-index mismatch between the sample and immersion liquid, which are difficult to separate. Additionally, accurate calibration of the <b>axial</b> <b>distances</b> in confocal microscopy remains cumbersome, although several high-end methods exist. In this paper we present two methods to calibrate <b>axial</b> <b>distances</b> in 3 D confocal microscopy that are both accurate and easily implemented. With these methods, we measured axial scaling factors {{as a function of}} refractive-index mismatch for high-aperture confocal microscopy imaging. We found that our scaling factors are almost completely linearly dependent on refractive index and that they were in good agreement with theoretical predictions that take the full vectorial properties of light into account. There was however a strong deviation with the theoretical predictions using (high-angle) geometrical optics, which predict much lower scaling factors. As an illustration, we measured the PSF of a correctly calibrated point-scanning confocal microscope and showed that a nearly index-matched, micron-sized spherical object is still significantly elongated due to this PSF, which signifies that care has to be taken when determining axial calibration or axial scaling using such particles...|$|R

The flow is subject to a constant wall temperature. Elliptic calculations on a half gross-section grid are performed for various Grashof numbers and two Prandtl numbers. It appears that for air (Pr= 0. 7) the flow exhibits a two-vortex solution for all Grashof numbers and axial positions investigated, whereas for water (Pr= 5. 0), secondary flow evolves from a two-vortex solution, via a four-voltex solution toward a six-voltex solution for increasing Grashof numbers and <b>axial</b> <b>distances.</b> Calculations on a full cross-section grid reveal that these solutions are <b>axial</b> <b>distances.</b> Calculations on a full cross-section grid reveal that these solutions are insensitive to white noise perturbations in the 2 ̆ 2 initial 2 ̆ 2 flow field...|$|R

Tests were conducted primarily in the aerodynamic-stripping regime of liquid atomization and {{it was found that the}} loss of small droplets due to vaporization and dispersion had a marketed effect on drop size measurements. The nitrogen gas flow rate exponent of 1. 33 is the same as that predicted by atomization theory for liquid jet breakup in high velocity gas flow. However, when the sprays were sampled farther downstream of the atomizer, at <b>axial</b> <b>distances</b> of 2. 5 and 4. 5 cm, the exponent for W sub n decreased 1. 2 and 0. 9, respectively.

40|$|A new {{specially}} designed analytical function approximating the intracellular action potentials (ICAPs) for {{calculation of the}} extracellular potentials (ECAPs) at various radial and <b>axial</b> <b>distances</b> from the active fibre is proposed. 4 -Aminopyridine (4 -AP) was used to obtain ICAPs with a prolonged repolarization phase in order to investigate the influence of changes in ICAP shape on the ECAPs. From the experimentally recorded ICAPs before and after treatment of frog skeletal muscle fibres with 4 -AP, approximated by the new function, the ECAPs were calculated applying the linesource model in a finite fibre. Using this function allowed calculation of the ECAPs at distances not accessible for the experimental recordings.

Our {{results showed that the}} ratio of the first positive to the negative phases of the ECAPs of treated fibres increased at large radial distances (3000 μm and more) and the terminal positive phase was asymmetric with an abrupt initial deflection followed by a slow inverse deflection.

5000|$|If the {{circumference}} of the helix is significantly less than a wavelength and its pitch (<b>axial</b> <b>distance</b> between successive turns) is significantly {{less than a quarter}} wavelength, the antenna is called a normal-mode helix. The antenna acts similar to a monopole antenna, with an omnidirectional radiation pattern, radiating equal power in all directions perpendicular to the antenna's axis. However, because of the inductance added by the helical shape, the antenna acts like a inductively loaded monopole; at its resonant frequency it is shorter than a quarter-wavelength long. Therefore, normal-mode helices can be used as electrically short monopoles, an alternative to center- or base-loaded whip antennas, in applications where a full sized quarter-wave monopole would be too big. As with other electrically short antennas, the gain, and thus the communication range, of the helix will be less than that of a full sized antenna. Their compact size makes [...] "helicals" [...] useful as antennas for mobile and portable communications equipment on the HF, VHF, and UHF bands.|$|E

During {{the process of the}} project design, 80 Greek and 5 Danish civil engineers and scientists from other specialties have worked on the project. Both the runway and the taxiway will be extended by 1,150 m, 1,000 m out into the sea, resulting in a runway that will have a total length of 3,440 m with an extra safety distance of 150 m. Its width will be 50 m while the taxiway's width, which will be located at an <b>axial</b> <b>distance</b> of 183 m from the runway, will be 23 m. The new runway and taxiway sections will be equipped with appropriate lighting and control systems, that will extend a further 750 m into the sea. The completion date was set in July 2011, but due to financial problems of the manufacturing company, reactions of environmental organizations and residents of the surrounding areas, fearing ecological dangers by extending land into the sea, the project has been held back. A new completion date for December 2012 was set, only to be pushed further back to July 2013 and then December 2015. The expansion of the runway will allow for the landing of larger aircraft, such as the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380, and increase safety, as the aircraft will have greater flexibility and visual contact on days with bad weather conditions.|$|E

40|$|The need to {{evaluate}} other fuel types {{for use in}} internal combustion engines has increased with the concerns related to the limited availability of fossil fuels {{and the need to}} reduce emissions. In this assessment, two alternative-to-diesel fuels, dimethyl ether and biodiesel, are characterized by their spray tip penetration at different <b>axial</b> <b>distances</b> from the nozzle tip and at different ambient pressure values. The sauter mean diameter values at various <b>axial</b> <b>distances</b> from the injector tip are also evaluated. A novel diesel spray model that presents the hydrodynamics features of sprays from the moments derived from a Gamma size distribution and the droplet-size distribution function, rather than from droplet-size classes, is used for the numerical predictions. The results indicate that the spray tip penetration for both fuels increases rapidly initially but the rate of increase slows at the later stages of the fuel injection. However, with increases in the ambient pressure values the predicted tip penetration decreases for both fuel sprays. Larger spray tip penetration and droplet size values are also predicted for the biodiesel fuel compared to the dimethyl ether fuel. These suggest better atomization at the given conditions for the dimethyl ether fuel spray. The predictions correctly capture the trends from the experimental data. However, there are differences between the predicted and experimental values at the early spray injection times. Thus, specific analytical models for the initial droplet size distribution and droplet break-up regime for the alternative fuel sprays might be required to improve the numerical model...|$|R
