2500|$|Moribana {{is one of}} {{the classic}} {{expressions}} of Banmi Shofu Ryu. The word Moribana means [...] "piled up flowers". Moribana uses one or more clusters of arrangements in kenzan to replicate how water plants grow and how creatures move around in natural ponds. Choice of materials and how much water shows in front, side, or back reflects the passing of the season. For example, more water is placed to the front during Spring and Summer. [...] This style was introduced by Unshin Ohara around 1890 after the Meiji restoration of 1868. Moribana is not only an expression of Unshin Ohara’s creative departure from Ikenobo, but was also <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>sign</b> of the Western influence in Japan.

Furthermore, he traveled through Palos, Moguer and Huelva, convincing his relatives and friends to enlist, composing of them the best crew possible.

2500|$|An old {{manuscript}} Margitas of uncertain date (discovered by {{the anthropologist}} H. Otley Beyer) give interesting {{details about the}} laws, government, social customs, and religious beliefs of the early Visayans, who settled Panay within {{the first half of}} the 13th century. The term Visayan was first applied only to them and to their settlements eastward in the island of Negros, and northward in the smaller islands, which now compose the province of Romblon. In fact, even at the early part of Spanish colonialization of the Philippines, the Spaniards used the term Visayan only for these areas. While the people of Cebu, Bohol, and Leyte were for a long time known only as Pintados. [...] The name Visayan was later extended to them around the beginning of the 1800s because, as several of the early writers state (especially in the writings of the Jesuit Lorenzo Hervás y Panduro published in 1801), albeit erroneously, their languages are closely allied to the Visayan [...] "dialect" [...] of Panay. This fact indicates that the ancient people of Panay called themselves as Visayans, for the Spaniards would have otherwise simply referred to them as [...] "people of the Panay". This self-reference as Visayans as well as the appellative (Panay - a riminescence of the State of Pannai) that these people give to the Island manifest <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>sign</b> of their identification with the precursor civilization of the Srivijayan Empire.|$|E

60|$|But {{just as he}} {{had tried}} opium, so his thought now began to turn upon gambling--not with {{appetite}} for its excitement, but with a sort of wistful inward gaze after that easy way of getting money, which implied no asking and brought no responsibility. If he had been in London or Paris at that time, it is probable that such thoughts, seconded by opportunity, would have taken him into a gambling-house, no longer to watch the gamblers, but to watch with them in kindred eagerness. Repugnance would have been surmounted by the immense need to win, if chance would be kind enough to let him.

He smiled over his plea for a renewal with stages and steps, a thing shaded, as they might say, and graduated; though--finely as she must respond--she met the smile but as she had met his entrance five minutes before. Her soft gravity at that moment--which was yet not solemnity, but the look of a consciousness charged with life to the brim and wishing not to overflow--had not qualified her welcome; what had done this being much more the presence in the room, for a couple of minutes, of the footman who had introduced him and who had been interrupted in preparing the tea-table.|$|E

6000|$|As the day went on I grew to {{wish that}} I {{had never heard}} of Aspern's relics, and I cursed the extravagant curiosity that had put John Cumnor on the scent of them. We had more than enough {{material}} without them, and my predicament was the just punishment of that most fatal of human follies, our not having known when to stop. It was very well to say it was no predicament, that the way out was simple, that I had only to leave Venice by the first train in the morning, after writing a note to Miss Tita, to be placed in her hand as soon as I got clear of the house; for it was <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>sign</b> that I was embarrassed that when I tried to make up the note in my mind in advance (I would put it on paper as soon as I got home, before going to bed), I could not think of anything but [...] "How can I thank you for the rare confidence you have placed in me?" [...] That would never do; it sounded exactly as if an acceptance were to follow. Of course I might go away without writing a word, but that would be brutal and my idea was still to exclude brutal solutions. As my confusion cooled I was lost in wonder at the importance I had attached to Miss Bordereau's crumpled scraps; the thought of them became odious to me, and I was as vexed with the old witch for the superstition that had prevented her from destroying them as I was with myself for having already spent more money than I could afford in attempting to control their fate. I forget what I did, where I went after leaving the Lido and at what hour or with what recovery of composure I made my way back to my boat. I only know that in the afternoon, when the air was aglow with the sunset, I was standing before the church of Saints John and Paul and looking up at the small square-jawed face of Bartolommeo Colleoni, the terrible condottiere who sits so sturdily astride of his huge bronze horse, on the high pedestal on which Venetian gratitude maintains him. The statue is incomparable, the finest of all mounted figures, unless that of Marcus Aurelius, who rides benignant before the Roman Capitol, be finer: but I was not thinking of that; I only found myself staring at the triumphant captain as if he had an oracle on his lips. The western light shines into all his grimness at that hour and makes it wonderfully personal. But he continued to look far over my head, at the red immersion of another day--he had seen so many go down into the lagoon through the centuries--and if he were thinking of battles and stratagems they were of a different quality from any I had to tell him of. He could not direct me what to do, gaze up at him as I might. Was it before this or after that I wandered about for an hour in the small canals, to the continued stupefaction of my gondolier, who had never seen me so restless and yet so void of a purpose and could extract from me no order but [...] "Go anywhere--everywhere--all over the place"? He reminded me that I had not lunched and expressed therefore respectfully the hope that I would dine earlier. He had had long periods of leisure during the day, when I had left the boat and rambled, so that I was not obliged to consider him, and I told him that that day, for a change, I would touch no meat. It was an effect of poor Miss Tita's proposal, not altogether auspicious, that I had quite lost my appetite. I don't know why it happened that on this occasion I was more than ever struck with that queer air of sociability, of cousinship and family life, which makes up half the expression of Venice. Without streets and vehicles, the uproar of wheels, the brutality of horses, and with its little winding ways where people crowd together, where voices sound as in the corridors of a house, where the human step circulates as if it skirted the angles of furniture and shoes never wear out, the place has the character of an immense collective apartment, in which Piazza San Marco is the most ornamented corner and palaces and churches, for the rest, play the part of great divans of repose, tables of entertainment, expanses of decoration. And somehow the splendid common domicile, familiar, domestic, and resonant, also resembles a theater, with actors clicking over bridges and, in straggling processions, tripping along fondamentas. As you sit in your gondola the footways that in certain parts edge the canals assume to the eye the importance of a stage, meeting it at the same angle, and the Venetian figures, moving to and fro against the battered scenery of their little houses of comedy, strike you as members of an endless dramatic troupe.|$|E

This case supports three conclusions: the existence of inferior variant BP, BP may be <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> initial <b>sign</b> of PRIS, and early recognition and action stopping propofol leads to favorable outcome in PRIS. 1 - 4 INTRODUCTION Propofol Infusion Syndrome (PRIS), once thought only to occur in children, has gained popularity in recent years due to its high morbidity and mortality in adults as well. Due to heightened awareness and detection bias, the incidence of PRIS is increasing. The cause of PRIS, hypothesized to be either by direct mitochondrial chain inhibition or dysfunctional fatty acid metabolism, remains unclear. 3 Since the infancy of the syndrome, cardiac conduction abnormalities and refractory bradycardia hhave been its hallmarks.
