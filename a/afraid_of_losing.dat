5|$|Near {{the end of}} Season 4, Wilson {{starts a}} romantic {{relationship}} with Amber Volakis, who is essentially a female version of House, and who competed {{for one of the}} open jobs on House's team in the wake of Foreman, Chase, and Cameron's departure. In the Season 4 finale, she dies after a bus crash sustained while picking up a drunken House from a bar. Her death eventually leads Wilson to conclude that his relationship with House serves to enable House's dysfunctions. To remove himself from House's influence, he resigns from Princeton-Plainsboro at the beginning of Season 5. The two reconcile when Wilson forces House to attend the funeral of House's father. Wilson realizes that he had been <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> House, who is his true friend, and that Wilson's life didn't get any better when he resigned. He then returns to Princeton-Plainsboro.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps most {{revealing}} of Tebbetts's character is his recollection of an umpire who suffered dizzy spells following {{his return from}} the war. <b>Afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> his job, the umpire asked Tebbetts, then the Tigers catcher, to help calling balls and strikes, and Tebbetts tipped him off with hand signals following each pitch.|$|E

Laura Horton (Bill's wife and Mickey's ex-wife) explains to her that her paralysis is no longer physical, but mental. Maggie is so <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> Mickey that she is causing the paralysis in her mind. After Mickey officially divorces Laura, Mickey and Maggie are married on Jan 25, 1975.|$|E

5000|$|A heartthrob singer, Tony Paige, {{also known}} as [...] "America's Boyfriend" [...] decides to wed a Swedish actress. His manager doesn't want this because he is <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> Tony <b>losing</b> female fans so he takes up a 300 {{thousand}} dollar insurance policy if Tony does in fact wed. Tony soon meets a girl named June Delaney on a bus who doesn't swoon over him like other girls. He falls for her but doesn't know her true identity.|$|R

But among the {{advantages}} of our Florence--the art, the olives, the sunshine, the cypresses, and don't let me forget the Arno and mountains at sunset time--is that of an all but infallible post office. One loses letters at Rome. Here, I think, we have lost one {{in the course of}} eight years, and for that loss I hold my correspondent to blame.|$|R
25|$|On {{his royal}} visit to Majapahit, Mansur Shah was also {{accompanied}} by these warriors. At that time, Majapahit {{was already at}} a declining state and found itself unable to overcome on the rising power of the Malay sultanate. After a display of Malaccan military prowess in his court, the king of Majapahit, <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> more territories, had agreed to marry off his daughter, Raden Galuh Cendera Kirana to Sultan Mansur Shah and relinquished control over Indragiri, Jambi, Tungkal and Siantan to Malacca.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} trade and wealth in the colonies caused {{increasing}} political tensions as frustration grew with the improving but still restrictive trade with Spain. Malaspina's recommendation to turn the empire into a looser confederation to help improve governance and trade so as to quell the growing political tensions between the Ã©lites of the empire's periphery and centre was suppressed by a monarchy <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> control. All was to be swept away by the tumult that was to overtake Europe {{at the turn of}} the 19th century with the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
25|$|In {{the space}} of two years, Swanson rocketed to stardom {{and was one of}} the most sought-after actresses in Hollywood. She later {{appeared}} in a series of films directed by Sam Wood. She starred in Beyond the Rocks (1922) with her longtime friend Rudolph Valentino. (Long believed to be a lost film, Beyond the Rocks was rediscovered in 2004 in a private collection in The Netherlands and is now available on DVD.) Swanson continued to make costume drama films for the next few years. So successful were her films for Paramount that the studio was <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> her and gave in to many of her whims and wishes.|$|E
500|$|Young actor Vincent Martella, {{previously}} {{known for}} The CW series Everybody Hates Chris, was cast {{for the role}} of Phineas. Martella originally auditioned for the role five months before his initial pickup, but was left without feedback for the time. When Dan Povenmire was given a tape of Martella in Everybody Hates Chris, he called him to do Phineas for the pilot. He designed a different voice than his own which he describes as [...] "wacky [...] crazy." [...] The creators were <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> him <b>losing</b> it when his voice changed, though he was still able to retain it for the most part even afterward, though the tone is now slightly different than the original sound.|$|R

Of course I'm not <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> his <b>losing</b> in the long run, but it isn't exactly a dignified thing to be associated with these concerns that aren't exactly A1.

25|$|The 17th Light rushed {{forward and}} drove the Russians out of Czarnowo. However, their opponents soon rallied and recaptured the village from the French. There was a lull in the action as Morand brought {{reinforcements}} up. He sent forward the 30th Line Infantry Regiment, one battalion {{along the banks of}} the Bug-Narew to attack on the right, a second battalion in a frontal attack, while the third battalion moved through a pine woods on the left. Ostermann-Tolstoy's troops also repelled this assault. <b>Afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> his heavy artillery, the Russian commander sent his to the rear. The French continued their attack and eventually seized Czarnowo, then deployed east of the village.|$|E
25|$|Stecher, {{although}} an able booker, was <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> his championship, refusing to wrestle many contenders as a result. This {{made it impossible}} for the Trio to retrieve it. They responded by calling the Munn-Zbyszko match illegitimate, and reinstated Munn as champion, but quickly had him drop it to Lewis. This left two champions, Ed Lewis and Joe Stecher, who were regarded as the dominant wrestlers of the period. Stecher and Lewis agreed to a unification match years later, in 1928, when Stecher gave in and lost the title to Lewis. By this time, the Zbyszko double-cross had already caused irreparable damage, detracting from the Trio's dominance over the wrestling industry. In addition, the build-up of Munn followed by such a humiliating loss had devalued his title and credibility as a major wrestling superstar permanently.|$|E
25|$|Emi is an energetic, extroverted blonde {{girl with}} twintails and forest-green eyes. She has {{prosthetic}} legs, having had her original legs amputated below the knees {{as a result}} of a car accident. Despite her disability, she still has more than enough lower body strength to walk, and in fact she is a successful track runner. She values good diet and exercise, and is on friendly terms with the head nurse of Yamaku; she promises to keep tabs on Hisao's exercise in exchange for having him as a running partner. Indeed, she meets Hisao by literally running into him in the hallway, and ironically endangers his heart on more than one occasion. Hisao feels guilty whenever she pouts, equating her expression to that of a sad puppy. Emi is Rin's friend and hall mate due to both having extremely passionate vocations and complementary disabilities. However, she has trouble getting emotionally close to people, because she is <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> people important to her.|$|E
50|$|On the 18th {{the wind}} shifted again, and blowing {{strongly}} from the west, piled the sea against the dams. With the rising water level, the flotilla was soon {{able to make}} a circuit around the bridge and canal, and successfully enter the Zoetermeer. A succession of fortified villages now stood {{in the way of the}} patriot fleet, and the Dutch Admiral was <b>afraid</b> even now <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> his prize, but the Spaniards, panicked by the rising waters, barely offered any resistance. Every one of their strongholds, now become islands, were deserted by the Royalist troops in their flight, except for the village of Lammen. This was a small fort under the command of Colonel Borgia, and situated about three-quarters of a mile from the walls of Leiden.|$|R

The rebels have worked west and north as far as Casita. There are no cavalrymen along the line beyond Casita, and there can't be. It's practically waterless desert. But these rebels are desert men. They could cross the line beyond the Rio Forlorn and smuggle arms into Mexico. Of course, {{my job is to}} keep tab on Chinese and Japs {{trying to get into the}} U.S. from Magdalena Bay. But I'm supposed to patrol the border line. I'm going to hire some rangers.

They know fine horses. They breed the finest in the world. So I don't sleep nights any more." ...|$|R
50|$|In March 1947 de Duve {{joined the}} faculty of the medical school of the Catholic University of Leuven {{teaching}} physiological chemistry. In 1951 he became full professor. In 1960 Detlev Bronk, the then president of the Rockfeller Institute (what is now Rockefeller University) of New York City, met him at Brussels and offered him professorship and a laboratory. The rector <b>of</b> Leuven, <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> entirely <b>losing</b> de Duve, made a compromise over dinner that de Duve would still be under part-time appointment with a relief from teaching and conducting examinations. The rector and Bronk made an agreement which would initially last for five years. The official implementation was in 1962, and de Duve simultaneously headed the research laboratories at Leuven and at Rockefeller University, dividing his time between New York and Leuven. In 1969 the Leuven university was split into two separate universities. He joined the French-speaking side of UniversitÃ© catholique de Louvain. He took emeritus status at UniversitÃ© catholique de Louvain in 1985 and at Rockefeller in 1988, though he continued to conduct research. Among other subjects, he studied the distribution of enzymes in rat liver cells using rate-zonal centrifugation. His work on cell fractionation provided an insight into the function of cell structures. He specialized in subcellular biochemistry and cell biology and discovered new cell organelles.|$|R
25|$|Mia visits Peyton, and Peyton is {{concerned}} that Mia is not focused on her work. She suggests to Mia that she listen to a CD of songs she could possibly sing. They clash because Mia writes all of her own songs. Eventually, Peyton gives up on Mia and asks her to leave the label. Meanwhile, Peyton deals with stomach pains. She sees a doctor about it, and tells the doctor about Ellie's cancer. Her tearful face after the phone call predicts trouble ahead. Peyton later finds out {{that she does not}} have cancer, but is actually pregnant. She tells Lucas first, and Haley finds out in her own time, but Peyton seems hesitant to share her news with Brooke because she knows how much Brooke has wanted a family. Peyton eventually tells Brooke, and Brooke is happy for her. Peyton has her first ultrasound, but is upset because she thinks that Lucas is too busy to come and has forgotten. Lucas surprises her by coming, and the two get to hear their baby's heartbeat for the first time. Later, Lucas and Peyton learn that Peyton has placenta praevia and that having this baby could mean the end of Peyton's life. Lucas, <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> her and raising a child that has to go through the same motherless state Peyton did, tries to guilt her into an abortion. They get past this and decide to have the baby. Lucas tells her that he wants to get married to her sooner, not because she might die beforehand, but because he loves her, and wants her to be his wife. Lucas and Peyton get married at the lake where they met. Haley is the minister. After the reception, Lucas and Peyton go home and Peyton collapses on the floor while waiting for Lucas's surprise. Lucas walks in the house and finds Peyton unconscious on the floor in a pool of blood. Peyton is rushed to the hospital by a blood-covered Lucas, who begs her not to leave him. Peyton goes through an emergency caesarean section, and falls into a coma. The caesarean section is successful and she has a daughter named Sawyer Brooke Scott. She later awakes with Lucas and Brooke by her side. Karen brings in Sawyer, and Nathan, Haley, Jamie and Julian join them. Dan visits Peyton and she, after some hesitation, allows Dan to hold Sawyer. She and Lucas then leave Tree Hill.|$|E

3000|$|... 3 For example, the Russian government, being <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> social {{protests and}} <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> {{popularity}} {{as a consequence}} of mass displacements, was ready to bail out potentially bankrupt firms. In September 2009, the largest Russian carmaker AVTOVAZ announced forthcoming mass layoffs (staff cuts by 30 %). The government intervened immediately to ban these plans, since it was <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the social and political consequences [Vedomosti, 9.10. 09]. As a result, the firm received a massive financial bailout.|$|R

500|$|According to Wong, {{the idea}} of using a roller-coaster {{derailment}} as the opening-scene disaster came from New Line Cinema executive Richard Bryant and was not inspired by a Big Thunder Mountain Railroad incident. The idea of death omens in photographs was taken from The Omen (1976). Morgan revealed he searched the aisles of a local store at Sunset Boulevard for days to get inspiration regarding Erin's death at the hardware store. According to Morgan, the loss of control was a major theme that he and Wong had envisioned from the very beginning for the film; this is exemplified by both Wendy, who is <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> control, as well as the roller coaster. He stated {{that one of the reasons}} people are afraid of roller coasters is because, according to psychologists, [...] " [...] have no control" [...] while on them.|$|E
500|$|According to Clark, {{the lyrics}} were {{primarily}} his creation, {{with a minor}} contribution being David Crosby's line, [...] "Rain grey town, known for its sound", a reference to London as home to the British Invasion, which was then dominating the U.S. music charts. [...] Other lyrics in the song that explicitly refer to the Byrds' stay in England include the couplet: [...] "Nowhere is there warmth to be found/Among those <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> their ground", which is {{a reference to the}} hostile reaction of the UK music press and to the English group the Birds serving the band with a copyright infringement writ, due to the similarities in name. [...] In addition, [...] "Round the squares, huddled in storms/Some laughing, some just shapeless forms" [...] describes fans waiting for the band outside hotels, while the line [...] "Sidewalk scenes and black limousines" [...] refers to the excited crowds that jostled the band as they exited their chauffeur-driven cars.|$|E
500|$|Presley was keen {{to resume}} regular live performing. Following {{the success of}} the Comeback Special, offers came in from around the world. The London Palladium offered Parker $28,000 for a one-week engagement. He responded, [...] "That's fine for me, now how much can you get for Elvis?" [...] In May, the brand new International Hotel in Las Vegas, boasting the largest {{showroom}} in the city, announced that it had booked Presley, scheduling him to perform 57 shows over four weeks beginning July 31. Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> the lucrative session work they had in Nashville. Presley assembled new, top-notch accompaniment, led by guitarist James Burton and including two gospel groups, The Imperials and The Sweet Inspirations. Nonetheless, he was nervous: his only previous Las Vegas engagement, in 1956, had been dismal, and he had neither forgotten nor forgiven that failure. To revise his approach to performances, Presley visited Las Vegas hotel showrooms and lounges, at one of which, that of the Flamingo, he encountered Tom Jones, whose aggressive style was similar to his own 1950s approach; the two became friends. Already studying karate at the time, Presley recruited Bill Belew to design variants of karatekas's gis for him; these, in jumpsuit form, would be his [...] "stage uniforms" [...] in his later years. Parker, who intended to make Presley's return the show business event of the year, oversaw a major promotional push. For his part, hotel owner Kirk Kerkorian arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance.|$|E
5000|$|Kiasi (...) is a Hokkien phrase, {{literally}} means <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> death, {{to describe}} the attitude <b>of</b> being overly <b>afraid</b> or timid.

500|$|The main plot {{regarding}} the two janitorsâSubhas and Khonaniâbattling for the late-night shift at 11:30p.m. closely mirrored the feud between television hosts Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien over the hosting job of The Tonight Show. Similar to the feud, in this 30 Rock episode, Khonani {{signed a contract}} five years ago {{to take over the}} 11:30p.m. from Subhas and asked Jack Donaghy to make it happen, which Jack does. In September 2004, it was announced by the NBC network that Jay Leno would be succeeded by Conan O'Brien in 2009 as host of The Tonight Show. Five years later, Leno would host his final episode of The Tonight Show in May 2009; similarly, Jack informs Subhas that Khonani will take over that shift. Subhas is not thrilled with this, resulting in Jack moving Subhas to the 10:00 shift; O'Brien took over as host of The Tonight Show in June 2009. NBC, <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> Leno to another network, gave him a new nightly prime time series, The Jay Leno Show, which premiered in September 2009 at 10:00p.m. In [...] "Khonani", as he begins his shift, Khonani is unhappy as there is no trash to pick up as it already has been collected by Subhas. As a result, Subhas goes back to the 11:30 shift, and Khonani leaves NBC to continue his janitorial duties at Foxwoods Resort Casino. The Jay Leno Show debuted to good ratings, however, as the show continued it would garner low ratings, resulting in NBC proposing that the show air at 11:35p.m. and that The Tonight Show be moved to 12:05. O'Brien, however, rejected the timeslot. In January 2010, O'Brien reached a deal with the network that would see him leave The Tonight Show on January 22, 2010, and two months later Leno returned as host of The Tonight Show on March 1, 2010. In April 2010, O'Brien signed a deal with the cable network TBS to host a new late-night talk show.|$|E
