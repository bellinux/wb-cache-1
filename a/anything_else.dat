5|$|Morgan: Before {{money or}} <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> Money cannot buy it… a man I {{do not trust}} could not get money from me on all the bonds in Christendom.|$|E
5|$|I've {{had a great}} time, but I'm frightened that, if I {{stick around}} too long, I'll end up unable to do <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> It's not about money, it's about doing other things and not wanting Mike to pale into insignificance.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking the}} Family Portrait series of images, which {{included}} Pale Blue Dot, NASA mission managers commanded Voyager 1 to power its cameras down, as the spacecraft {{was not going}} to fly near <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> of significance for the rest of its mission, while other instruments that were still collecting data needed power for the long journey to interstellar space.|$|E
5000|$|Intuitively, B's height {{will have}} {{remained}} the same whereas A's height and all ways of measuring height will have changed. Really, it is A's height and all ways of measuring height that will have changed. The problem {{with the notion of}} [...] "Cambridge change" [...] is its failure to acknowledge that B's or <b>anything</b> <b>else's</b> height is relational (relative to ways of measuring height). [...] "Height" [...] is thus not unary and thus is extrinsic, not intrinsic.|$|R
40|$|This essay {{engages with}} recent {{scholarly}} debates in Victorian studies focused, first, on narrative’s {{relationship to the}} optative mood, and, second, {{on the status of}} minor characters in fiction. Its reading of Oliver Twist both extends and challenges prior work by Andrew Miller and Alex Woloch, among others. With particular emphasis on the protagonist’s minor alter-ego, Dick, the essay considers what difference fictional mode makes to the possibility of <b>anything</b> <b>else’s</b> happening to a character than what we read about him or her...|$|R

5|$|Asked by a {{journalist}} once, {{he said that}} his favourite city was London, and in another instance he said that Mohammed Ali Jinnah had asked him to join the Pakistan Army during the partition in 1947, and in his usual jovial style, commented that if he had joined the Pakistan Army, then India would have been defeated in the 1971 war. The latter remark attracted as much criticism as <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in his career.|$|E
5|$|If I {{wanted to}} get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the one I would offer up. I think it's because it is to me the least flawed; let me put it that way. It is the most {{successful}} for what I tried to do. I succeeded more completely in my view with that than with <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{coaching}} stock was extremely solidly constructed, and offered levels of accommodation {{far in advance}} of <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> at the time - certainly compared to any other narrow gauge railway. Almost 70 years later, the design {{was used as the}} basis for a new rake of carriages built by the Ffestiniog - testament to the excellence of the original design.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Assingham, still darkly contemplative, denied {{this with}} a headshake. [...] "She won't 'put' it anywhere. She won't do with it <b>anything</b> anyone <b>else</b> would. She'll take it all herself." ...|$|R

5|$|The sauropods {{were the}} largest and {{heaviest}} dinosaurs. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in their habitat, and the largest were {{an order of magnitude}} more massive than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric mammals such as Paraceratherium (the largest land mammal ever) were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only modern whales approach or surpass them in size. There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods, including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity, but {{it may be that the}} most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in rock formations interpreted as dry or seasonally dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low-nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments.|$|E
5|$|Aston {{commented that}} {{throughout}} his life he suffered from poor health; he was afflicted with aspergillosis from the early 1980s, and was also asthmatic. He suffered a brain haemorrhage in March 2003, and was hospitalised for two weeks. The experience sent him into depression for eighteen months, during which time he read the autobiography of actress Jane Lapotaire, who {{had gone through the}} same experience, something which he believed aided his recovery more than <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
5|$|Irene was Johnson's only play, and {{was first}} {{performed}} on 6 February 1749 in a production {{by his friend}} and former pupil, David Garrick. The play was a commercial success and earned Johnson more money than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> he had written up to that point. It was never revived during his lifetime, {{and there is no}} subsequent evidence of any other full-scale productions of Irene anywhere until 1999, {{making it one of the}} most unsuccessful plays ever written by a major author.|$|E
60|$|FRANK. Well, {{either they}} were too flabbergasted to say <b>anything,</b> or <b>else</b> Crofts had {{prepared}} your mother. Anyhow, she didn't say anything; and Crofts didn't say anything; and Praddy only stared. After tea they got up and went; and I've not seen them since.|$|R

5|$|My {{interpretation}} {{is that she}} isn’t {{trying to keep the}} secret. That she doesn’t care. She changed her last name to avoid getting kidnapped, but really, if anyone figured it out and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. I feel like everyone at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda that it would never occur to them to think that anyone else has <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> going on.|$|E
5|$|News reports linked Caspersen with {{financial}} problems and accusations of alleged large-scale tax evasion that {{were discovered in}} the course of federal investigations into offshore tax shelters managed by financial firms UBS and LGT Bank, and used by wealthy American clients. Near the end of his life, Caspersen was subjected to an IRS audit with a possible focus on alleged offshore accounts. An attorney for Caspersen’s estate claimed that in 2013 the IRS effectively exonerated Caspersen posthumously—with no penalties or fines for offshore accounts or <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} reforms {{helped shape}} the cavalry's contribution to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which was established with one cavalry division supported by two brigades of horse artillery. All would be trained for the mounted charge but would also be armed with rifles, the only major power to do so. The cavalry regiments were armed with Maxim Machine Guns, although these were replaced by Vickers Machine Guns from 1912. More than <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> the issue of entrenching tools that were carried on the troop packhorses demonstrated how much the cavalry's doctrine had changed since the Boer Wars.|$|E
5000|$|Martin Murray of [...] "Pulse Magazine said [...] "their {{music is}} also so totally {{different}} than <b>anything</b> anyone <b>else</b> {{is doing in}} this area, that these guys are pretty much in a class all by themselves.

5000|$|Musically, {{the album}} was notable for the 11 minute track [...] "Circle" [...] {{comprising}} several movements, [...] "a soundscape of Harper's difficult youth" [...] that, according to Harper, was [...] "totally unlike <b>anything</b> anyone <b>else</b> was doing. The Beatles weren’t doing anything like that at the time. The Stones weren’t doing anything like it, either. No-one was" ...|$|R

5|$|After a {{break on}} the Tuesday evening, the show {{returned}} on Wednesday whilst averaging 4.65m for the first show of the evening, a 21% audience share which was larger than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in its timeslot. The second episode broadcast at 9:30pm, with 4.46m, an 18.7% share which was beaten by an episode of BBC One's Who Do You Think You Are? on Emilia Fox which commanded 5.39 million viewers. Ratings continued to decline on the Thursday evening shows, with both shows being viewed by fewer than four million viewers for the first time, 3.81m and 3.86m respectively, seeing the first show being beaten by BBC One's Watchdog which gained 5.23m in the 8pm slot.|$|E
5|$|The {{new state}} {{legislature}} had also appointed a five-man committee {{to select a}} city {{to be the new}} state capital. Scott applied to have Petersburg, still a fledgling settlement, designated as the capital. Other localities– including Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, and Boonesborough– also applied. Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the state capital contributed more than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to the settlement's failure to even become a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., wrote to his brother Daniel that their father was planning to run for Congress in 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began. He was, however, chosen as a presidential elector in 1793.|$|E
5|$|The notable {{exception}} to this was when land was claimed by the Connecticut-based owners of the Susquehanna Company, who had been granted titles to land claimed by Connecticut in the Wyoming Valley, {{in an area that}} is now Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The area was also claimed by Pennsylvania, which refused to recognize the Connecticut titles. Allen, after being promised land, traveled to the area and began stirring up not just Pennsylvania authorities but also his long-time nemesis, Governor Clinton of New York, by proposing that a new state be carved out of the disputed area and several counties of New York. The entire affair was more bluster than <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> and was resolved amicably when Pennsylvania agreed to honor the Connecticut titles.|$|E

All they were going for was the drum track." ...|$|R

5|$|There is {{no doubt}} that it is on the work of tools {{directed}} by brains that the future of Australia depends more than <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> With tools our Australian deserts may be turned into gardens... They will pluck the hidden treasure from the bowels of the earth, enable us to soar in the air, or explore the depths of the water. They will weave a network of communication over our island continent, dot it with the homes of a happy people, and minister to our wants in providing not only the necessities and comforts of life, but the most refined luxuries that are needed to satisfy the novel and exacting wants which arise every day, as the standard of intellectual and technical cultivation is raised and extended among us...|$|E
5|$|Vandersteen was creatively active {{from his}} youth. He drew {{pictures}} with crayons on sidewalks, and invented stories {{for his friends}} about knights and legends. He even convinced his young friends to buy him crayons so he could depict the local cycling championship. At school as well, he {{was more interested in}} telling stories and learning about art than <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> His best memory of these schooldays is of a teacher who introduced him to the works of Pieter Brueghel. Outside school, {{he spent most of his}} time with comic magazines and adventure books by Jules Verne or books about Nick Carter and Buffalo Bill. At 13, he enrolled at the Academie voor Schone Kunsten in Antwerp to study sculpture, and two years later he started working as sculptor and decorator, just like his father.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Nikephoros' murderer and successor, John I Tzimiskes, {{was unable}} to {{intervene}} in person in the east due to the more menacing invasion of the Balkans by Sviatoslav I of Kiev. As a result, he sent a small force under a trusted eunuch of his household, the patrikios Nicholas, who according to the contemporary Leo the Deacon was experienced in battle, to relieve the siege. In the meantime, the siege of Antioch had continued for five months over winter and into spring, without result. At some point, a Fatimid detachment—according to Ibn al-Dawadari 4,000 men under a Berber chieftain called Aras and a former emir of Tarsus, Ibn az-Zayyat—moved north against Alexandretta, where the Byzantine relief army had camped. Informed of their approach, the Byzantine commander vacated the camp and placed his troops in ambush. Finding the enemy encampment deserted, the Fatimid troops began to plunder it, heedless of <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> At that moment, Nicholas launched a surprise attack from all sides and the Fatimid force disintegrated; most of the Muslim army perished, but Aras with Ibn az-Zayyat managed to escape.|$|E
