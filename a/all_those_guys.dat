5000|$|In the mid-1980s, {{inspired}} by the British blues boom of the 1960s and 1970s, Petit moved from California to London, England. Petit believes that British blues had as much impact on the genre as that of its African American pioneers: [...] "The British contribution to the blues is equal, in my eyes, to what Robert Johnson did, Blind Lemon Jefferson ... <b>all</b> of <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> <b>all</b> the way through to Muddy Waters. I {{think it is a}} certainty that without the British blues boom the music (blues) would not have anything remotely like the profile it does." ...|$|R
5000|$|Shaw further {{elaborated}} on {{the ideas}} behind the album {{in a career}} retrospective for THUMP: [...] "It's club music. Right now, I feel it's really great how quite functional techno and noise--the kind of stuff I would have played in a bar in 2006 just to annoy people--seems to be this fruitful area of music that is really adventurous and is challenging the idea of what music can be. The appeal of <b>all</b> <b>those</b> noise <b>guys</b> is that, you don't go there because it's going to press all of your pleasure buttons, you go there because you get this hypnotic sensation from texture. It works at Berghain, but also at a church in London, or at the Jazz Cafe." ...|$|R

Both of his parents were natives of Ghana in West Africa, and Papa began playing soccer. He could not skate, meaning he {{struggled}} with ice hockey, Canada's most popular sport. Oppong said, [...] "Soccer is really popular in Africa, so my dad got me into soccer. Basketball is more of my love.

Foo Fighters' drummer Taylor Hawkins told Q magazine that he thought Walsh's guitar solo on [...] "Outside" [...] was the champagne moment on the Sonic Highways album.

[...] Burton revealed that he was afraid he would not finish in the top ten finishing positions, but praised his team for the way he ran the race. Johnson was upset over his speeding penalty: [...] "I was just trying to get off and get on and get back in the race, and I got a speeding violation. I wasn’t doing anything differently.” He also said he disliked missing an opportunity to score more points and stated he needed more luck. Bowyer (who led 43 laps) admitted that he was a fault for his lap-173 crash, saying he was trying very hard to win the race. Riggs said he was attempting to give Bowyer more room, and acknowledged that Bowyer was unhappy. Earnhardt stated he was not pleased with his tenth-place finish, but was happy to run with the leaders despite the problems with his car: [...] "It was a good day - a good car. And great pit stops <b>all</b> day. <b>Those</b> <b>guys</b> are really on their game. I am so proud of the effort of my guys. We were better than a 10th-place car and they deserve to finish in the top-three, but the scoreboard doesn't always show how good your team is." ...|$|R

5000|$|The rivalry {{began to}} change in 1993, during Ron McBride's fourth season as head coach, the Utes won their first game in Provo in twenty-two seasons and their first since LaVell Edwards became BYU head coach. Late in the fourth quarter, Utah's kicker Chris Yergensen, who had already missed {{two out of three}} field goals on the day, {{attempted}} to break the 31-31 tie. This time, Yergensen did not miss and kicked the game-winning 55-yard field goal, the longest of his career, with less than a minute remaining. <b>All</b> <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> think that's all there is to life.

Cougar players returned to the field to protect the goalpost from being torn down. About the incident, Lenny Gomes, a BYU nose guard, said, [...] "Typical Utah bullshit. <b>All</b> <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> think that's all there is to life.

500|$|Corey Taylor {{explained}} that the phrase [...] "All Hope Is Gone" [...] is aimed at the fans' expectations of the band, further elaborating, [...] "Just when you thought you had us figured out, give up all hope because you're never, ever going to." [...] Throughout the album, Taylor incorporates a focus on politics in his lyrics, compared to Slipknot's previous albums. The opening track, [...] ".execute.", features Taylor's response to former United States Vice President Spiro Agnew's speech targeted at Vietnam War protesters. and the second track [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] follows in the same vein. During an interview with Kerrang!, Taylor discussed the song's lyrical content, explaining, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} people who are disguising politics as religion and dictating taste and turning it into policy. And that hurts me." [...] Reviewing for IGN, Jim Kaz said that lyrically, [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] gives the listener a [...] "heaping dose of Corey Taylor's caustic bravado". On the track [...] "Wherein Lies Continue", Taylor offers a [...] "dressing down of the world as we know it", explaining, [...] "It kinda goes up against any civilization that takes themselves way too seriously and where the 'leaders' are so pretentious that they think they are deemed to speak for the people." [...] He also proclaimed, [...] "It wouldn't be a Slipknot album if I didn't rag on the recording industry." [...] On [...] "Butcher's Hook", Taylor specifically targets [...] "all those little emo boys", commenting, [...] "People give us shit for wearing outfits, but <b>all</b> of <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> look exactly the same." ...|$|R
50|$|He knocked us out, so I said: “Fred, {{what do you}} think?” He said: “He’s Junior. I’ll be Hoke.” And Alec was extraordinary. It rained a lot {{during the}} shoot, which would shut us down because {{you could hear the}} rain on the roof, it was too loud, so we’d have to wait it out. One day we were sitting around Junior and Susie’s house, and Alec gets behind the camera and does about a five-minute {{impression}} of Tak Fujimoto. Then he moves over to the electrical department and does spot-on impressions of <b>all</b> of <b>those</b> <b>guys.</b> Everybody was awestruck. He also did an impression of me that was rather insulting, and very funny. What I wanted to do in that was have the audience go on that ride with Junior while he was running around and playing cop, and to really enjoy it—and the audiences I saw it with did—but then slowly I wanted to take it away from them, so that by the end they would feel a little bit guilty about having so much fun earlier on in the picture. However, it kind of backfired—we did a preview in New Jersey, and the audience was horrified when Junior died, they practically rioted when Alec was killed... Alec had a little problem with that—he wanted to be a little broader, I was afraid he was commenting on the character, but I must tell you: he was right. We didn’t really agree on set, but then he gave me a call later... and said: “Hey, I’m glad you made me do this and that.” I said: “I’m glad you did what you did, too.” It was a little broader than I would’ve asked him to play it, but I really like what he did.|$|R

While appearing on Broadway in Stalag 17, he got his break into television by getting the role of Corporal Steve Henshaw on the popular The Phil Silvers Show program. TV fans of this era usually best remember his role as Henshaw, Sergeant Bilko’s right-hand man on that show. “He was proudest of that show,” Amalia Melvin said. “I think the camaraderie of <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> made it such a pleasant way to work.

(IATSE stands for International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts. - Ed.) Warner Bros. told us we had to be on a plane by November 1.

He also walked Mike Heath and Mario Guerrero. The win was Huffman's final victory as a major league pitcher.

The flexibility of that really appeals to me.I think the mixes <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> did came out really cool, many of them vastly different from what would have come out of the studio if I had done them.

I always had in my head, 'I'm gonna make a record where there are no rap verses.' And that's what '6 Words' is. It's not like {{everyday}} rap and I'd say that Gary Barlow and Chris Martin inspired it because, in the studio, all I was thinking was that I needed to write a better song than what they would write." ...|$|E
