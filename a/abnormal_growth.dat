5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the <b>abnormal</b> <b>growth</b> of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E
5|$|A {{brain tumor}} is an <b>abnormal</b> <b>growth</b> of cells within the brain or inside the skull, {{and can be}} {{cancerous}} (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just over half of all primary brain tumors are malignant; the rest are benign, though they may still be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times more common than primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} interplay of <b>abnormal</b> loan <b>growth,</b> credit {{reporting}} system and systemic risk in banking. Based on a sample of publicly traded banks in Asia from 1998 to 2012, higher <b>abnormal</b> loan <b>growth</b> leads to higher systemic risk one year ahead. A closer investigation further suggests that better credit information coverage and private credit bureaus can stem the buildup of bank systemic risk one year ahead due to higher <b>abnormal</b> loan <b>growth.</b> Eventually, this paper offers some supports to strengthen macro-prudential regulation to limit <b>abnormal</b> loan <b>growth.</b> This paper also advocates the importance of strengthening credit information coverage {{and the role of}} private credit bureaus in Asian countries to mitigate the negative impact of <b>abnormal</b> loan <b>growth</b> on bank systemic stability...|$|R

25|$|When the Civil War ended, {{a boom in}} {{railroad}} construction ensued, with roughly 55,000 kilometers (35,000 miles) of new track {{being laid}} from coast-to-coast between 1866 and 1873. The railroads, then the second largest employer outside of agriculture, required large amounts of capital investment, and thus entailed massive financial risk. Speculators fed {{large amounts of money}} into the industry, causing <b>abnormal</b> <b>growth</b> and over-expansion. Jay Cooke's firm, like many other banking firms, invested a disproportionate share of depositors' funds in the railroads, thus paving the way for the ensuing collapse.|$|E
25|$|Microscopic {{examination}} of {{retinal pigment epithelium}} and skin pigment cells (melanocytes) of people affected by ocular albinism type 1 reveal the presence of characteristic macromelanosomes, even though skin appears normal. Studies from Oa1 knock-out mice reveal that these giant melanosomes appear due to <b>abnormal</b> <b>growth</b> of a single melanosome and not due to aggregation or fusion of many melanosomes. These melanin macroglobules are probably formed due to failure of melanosomes to separate from the ER-golgi system with the accumulation of enzymes and other secretory proteins leading to an increase organelle size. However, Incerti, et al. contradict the above theory.|$|E
25|$|Tumor (American English) or tumour (British English), Latin for swelling, {{one of the}} {{cardinal}} signs of inflammation, originally meant any form of swelling, neoplastic or not. Current English, however, both medical and non-medical, uses tumor as a synonym for a neoplasm (a solid or fluid-filled cystic lesion {{that may or may}} not be formed by an <b>abnormal</b> <b>growth</b> of neoplastic cells) that appears enlarged in size. Some neoplasms do not form a tumor; these include leukemia and most forms of carcinoma in situ. Tumor is also not synonymous with cancer. While cancer is by definition malignant, a tumor can be benign, precancerous, or malignant.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Vapor-, electro-, and electroless-{{deposits}} {{have usually}} strong fiber textures. When annealed, the deposits undergo recrystallization or <b>abnormal</b> grain <b>growth</b> {{to reduce their}} energy stored during deposition. The driving force for recrystallization is mainly caused by dislocations, whereas that for <b>abnormal</b> grain <b>growth</b> {{is due to the}} grain boundary, surface, interface, and strain energies. During recrystallization and <b>abnormal</b> grain <b>growth,</b> the texture change can take place. The recrystallization and <b>abnormal</b> grain <b>growth</b> textures are in general of fiber type. However, copper interconnects are subjected to non-planar stress state due to geometric constraints during room temperature and/or elevated temperature annealing. The annealing textures of the thin films and copper interconnects are discussed in terms of the minimization of the surface, interface, and strain energies, the grain boundary energy and mobility, and the strain-energy-release maximization...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the complex}} nature of {{internal}} interfaces {{it has been a}} continual challenge to link the grain growth behavior of alumina (especially the onset of <b>abnormal</b> grain <b>growth)</b> to the internal interface structure and chemistry, and the associated atomic transport rate. The present work considers the problem of normal and <b>abnormal</b> grain <b>growth</b> development in calcia-doped alumina, a system noted for its complex <b>abnormal</b> grain <b>growth</b> behavior, in terms of the new concept of interface complexions. Calcia-doped alumina was shown to exhibit four distinct grain-boundary complexions in the temperature range of 13251 – 18701 C. All four complexions may coexist at a single temperature. Each complexion is associated with a characteristic grain-boundary mobility, all of which enhances the grain growth kinetics relative to undoped alumina. It was found that the activation energy for the different complexions (normal and <b>abnormal</b> grain <b>growth)</b> was approximately the same in each case (B 450 kJ/mol). This is discussed in the context of interface- versus diffusion-controlled grain growth, and it is concluded that normal and <b>abnormal</b> grain <b>growth</b> in this system is diffusion controlled.

25|$|It is {{possible}} that the increased expression of Eph in cancer plays several roles, first, by acting as survival factors or as a promoter of <b>abnormal</b> <b>growth.</b> The angiogenic properties of the Eph system may increase vascularisation of and thus growth capacity of tumors. Second, elevated Eph levels may disrupt cell-cell adhesion via cadherin, known to alter expression and localisation of Eph receptors and ephrins, which is known to further disrupt cellular adhesion, a key feature of metastatic cancers. Third, Eph activity may alter cell matrix interactions via integrins by the sequestering of signaling molecules following Eph receptor activation, as well as providing potential adherence via ephrin ligand binding following metastasis.|$|E
500|$|Grafting is {{used for}} species {{difficult}} to grow well in cultivation or that cannot grow independently, such as some chlorophyll-free forms with white, yellow or red bodies, or some forms that show <b>abnormal</b> <b>growth</b> (e.g., cristate or monstrose forms). For the host plant—the [...] "stock"—growers choose one that grows strongly in cultivation and {{is compatible with the}} plant to be propagated—the scion. The grower makes cuts on both stock and scion and joins the two, binding them together while they unite. Various kinds of graft are used—flat grafts, where both scion and stock are of similar diameters, and cleft grafts, where a smaller scion is inserted into a cleft made in the stock.|$|E
500|$|Most of the pathologies {{occurred}} on the vertebrae. For example, a dorsal (back) vertebra from a juvenile animal showed an exostosis (bony growth) on its underside. The growth probably resulted from the conversion of cartilage or a ligament to bone during development, but {{the cause of the}} ossification was not determined. Hypervitaminosis A and bone spurs were ruled out, and an osteoma (benign bone tumor) was deemed unlikely. Another specimen, a small caudal (tail) vertebra, was also found to have an <b>abnormal</b> <b>growth,</b> this time on the top of its neural spine, which projects upwards from the vertebrae, allowing muscle attachment. Similar growths from the neural spine have been found in specimens of Allosaurus and Masiakasaurus, probably resulting from the ossification of a ligament running either between the neural spines [...] (interspinal ligament) or along their tops (supraspinal ligament).|$|E

2500|$|Gibberellins, or GAs, {{include a}} large range of {{chemicals}} that are produced naturally within plants and by fungi. They were first discovered when Japanese researchers, including Eiichi Kurosawa, noticed a chemical {{produced by a}} fungus called Gibberella fujikuroi that produced <b>abnormal</b> <b>growth</b> in rice plants. Gibberellins are important in seed germination, affecting enzyme production that mobilizes food production used for growth of new cells. [...] This is done by modulating chromosomal transcription. [...] In grain (rice, wheat, corn, etc.) seeds, a layer of cells called the aleurone layer wraps around the endosperm tissue. Absorption of water by the seed causes production of GA. [...] The GA is transported to the aleurone layer, which responds by producing enzymes that break down stored food reserves within the endosperm, which are utilized by the growing seedling. GAs produce bolting of rosette-forming plants, increasing internodal length. They promote flowering, cellular division, and in seeds growth after germination. Gibberellins also reverse the inhibition of shoot growth and dormancy induced by ABA.|$|E
