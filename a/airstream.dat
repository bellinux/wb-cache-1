40|$|Transport of {{boundary}} layer {{air to the}} free troposphere by cyclones during NASA's Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific (TRACE-P) experiment is investigated. <b>Airstreams</b> responsible for {{boundary layer}} venting are diagnosed using results from a high-resolution meteorological model (MM 5) together with in situ and remotely sensed chemical data. Hourly wind data from the MM 5 are used to calculate three-dimensional grids of backward air trajectories. A reverse domain filling (RDF) technique then is employed to examine the characteristics of <b>airstreams</b> over the computational domain, and to isolate <b>airstreams</b> ascending from the boundary layer to the free troposphere during the previous 36 hours. Two cases are examined in detail. Results show that <b>airstreams</b> responsible for venting the boundary layer differ considerably from those described by classic conceptual models and in the recent literature. In addition, <b>airstreams</b> sampled by the TRACE-P aircraft are found to exhibit large variability in chemical concentrations. This variability is {{due to differences in}} the boundary layer histories of individual <b>airstreams</b> with respect to anthropogenic sources over continental Asia and Japan. Complex interactions between successive wave cyclones also are found to be important in determining the chemical composition of the <b>airstreams.</b> Particularly important is the process of post-cold frontal boundary layer air being rapidly transported offshore and recirculated into ascending <b>airstreams</b> of upstream cyclones...|$|R

50|$|Being {{a part of}} Pannonian plain the Municipality of Temerin has its climate characteristics. Pannonian plain {{is quite}} {{far away from the}} Adriatic or the Mediterranean Sea on the south and the Atlantic Ocean on the west. These {{distances}} are even bigger because of Dinarics and Alps mountain ranges which keep the humid <b>airstreams</b> coming from seas and oceans away. <b>Airstreams,</b> influencing weather changes through the year, are conditioned by unequal warming of Earth surface and different atmospheric pressures above Adriatic and Mediterranean, Atlantic Ocean and wide Euro-Asian land. Water surfaces cause breach of humid airflows into Pannonian plain and land surfaces on the north and east influence dry, very cold <b>airstreams</b> in winter and very hot <b>airstreams</b> in summer. Influenced by all of these causes, Pannonian plain has the most continental climate in Serbia.|$|R

25|$|Flaps also {{contrast}} with trills, where the <b>airstream</b> causes the articulator to vibrate. Trills may be realized {{as a single}} contact, like a flap, but are variable, whereas a flap {{is limited to a}} single contact. When a trill is brief and made with a single contact it is sometimes erroneously described as an (allophonic) flap, but a true flap is an active articulation whereas a trill is a passive articulation. That is, for a tap or flap the tongue makes an active gesture to contact the target place of articulation, whereas with a trill the contact is due to the vibration caused by the <b>airstream</b> rather than any active movement.|$|E

40|$|Flow in {{geophysical}} fluids {{is commonly}} summarized by coherent streams, for example conveyor belt flows in extratropical cyclones or jet streaks {{in the upper}} troposphere. Typically, parcel trajectories are calculated from the flow field and subjective thresholds are used to distinguish coherent streams of interest. This methodology contribution develops a more objective approach to distinguish coherent <b>airstreams</b> within extratropical cyclones. Agglomerative clustering is applied to trajectories along with a method to identify the optimal number of cluster classes. The methodology is applied to trajectories associated with the low-level jets of a well-studied extratropical cyclone. For computational efficiency, a constraint that trajectories must pass through these jet regions is applied prior to clustering; the partitioning into different <b>airstreams</b> is then performed by the agglomerative clustering. It is demonstrated that the methodology can identify the salient flow structures of cyclones: the warm and cold conveyor belts. A test focusing on the <b>airstreams</b> terminating {{at the tip of}} the bent-back front further demonstrates the success of the method in that it can distinguish fine-scale flow structure such as descending sting jet <b>airstreams...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{mathematical}} model {{was developed to}} describe the coupled heat and mass transfers in membrane processes. Equations for the heat and mass transfer resistances were derived and the coupling effects of the heat and mass transfer were analyzed. With taking the membrane separation process of moist air as an example, the effects of air temperature and water vapor concentration on the heat and moisture transfer process were investigated. The results show that neither the thermal resistance nor the moisture resistance are constant, they are affected by not only the membrane parameters but also the air state. As the temperature {{difference between the two}} <b>airstreams</b> separated by the membrane increases, both the thermal and moisture resistances decrease, causing an improved heat and mass transfer. As the average temperature of the two <b>airstreams</b> increases, the thermal resistance remains almost constant while the moisture resistance decreases significantly. Further, as the water vapor concentration difference between the two <b>airstreams</b> increases, both the thermal and moisture resistances increase. As the average water vapor concentration of the two <b>airstreams</b> increases, the thermal resistance remains unchanged while the moisture resistance decreases...|$|R

The recovery methods available range from fairly simple, well-known devices that have been around for years to new sophisticated equipment that is constantly entering the marketplace. Commonly applied to plant ventilation and process <b>airstreams</b> are these three general energy-recovery methods: 1. Substituting source-capture hoods and high-efficiency air cleaners for exhaust ventilation systems to permit recirculation. 2. Placing heat exchangers in process stacks and general ventilation <b>airstreams,</b> and 3. Collecting hydrocarbon contaminants from process stacks and reusing or selling them.

40|$|Abstract: A Lagrangian {{methodology}} for the reconstruction and {{the analysis of}} the <b>airstreams</b> governing the transport of water vapour has been applied to analyse three recent extreme precipitation events over the Alps (3 - 5 November 1966, 16 - 18 November 2000 and 24 - 26 November 2002). The analysis outlines that the precipitation over the North-East of Italy is strongly conditioned by the evaporation rate and by properties of airmasses over the Central Mediterranean area. In particular most of the water vapour contributing to the precipitation ending over the Alps originates over Tunisia, the coastal regions in the western Lybia, the Channel of Sicilia, the Gulf of Gabes and the southerly Thyrrenian Sea. A simplified conceptual model is also proposed to visualize the traits of the moist <b>airstreams</b> inside the Mediterranean cyclones. Two patterns of <b>airstreams</b> can be identified, according to the scheme proposed by Browning and Roberts, 1994. The trajectory population of the two portions of WCB is a crucial factor controlling the precipitation production...|$|R
