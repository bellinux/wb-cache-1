5|$|Norway {{prohibited}} {{nuclear warheads}} {{to be stored}} on its soil, preventing Banak from serving in a role as <b>a</b> <b>base</b> <b>for</b> US nuclear-armed bombers. NATO's military interest for Banak peaked during the late 1960s. Increased range of Soviet aircraft during the 1970s diminished the need for troops in Finnmark; combined with Norwegian tension and nuclear policies, this caused the United States to favor Vestfjorden and Troms over Banak as the primary areas of defense.|$|E
