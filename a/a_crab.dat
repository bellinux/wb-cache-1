5|$|Ariel, a sixteen-year-old mermaid princess, is {{dissatisfied}} with underwater {{life in the}} kingdom of Atlantica, and is curious about the human world. With her best friend Flounder, Ariel collects human artifacts in her grotto, and often goes {{to the surface of the}} ocean to visit Scuttle, a seagull who offers very inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She ignores the warnings of her father King Triton, the ruler of Atlantica, and Sebastian, <b>a</b> <b>crab</b> who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden.|$|E
5|$|The {{race has}} been won 42 times by Cambridge and 30 times by Oxford, with Cambridge leading Oxford in {{cumulative}} wins since 1966. The reserves race has been won 25 times by Cambridge and 20 times by Oxford, with Cambridge leading in cumulative wins since {{the inception of}} the race. The 2017 race took place on Sunday 2 April at 16:35 British Summer Time, an hour before the men's race. Cambridge won {{for the first time in}} five years after Oxford caught <b>a</b> <b>crab</b> at the start. They set a record on the new course, beating the time first set on this course in 2015 by over a minute. The time was faster, in different conditions, than the Cambridge men's Blue Boat in 2016 and the Oxford men's in 2014.|$|E
5|$|After {{trekking}} {{across the}} desert and nearly dying of dehydration, Tintin and Haddock are rescued and taken to a French outpost, where they hear on the radio the storm sunk the Karaboudjan. They travel to a Moroccan port, {{and along the way}} are attacked by Tuareg tribesmen, defending themselves with French MAS-36 rifles. At the port, members of his old crew kidnap the Captain after he recognises their disguised Karaboudjan. Tintin meets Thomson and Thompson who got his message, and they learn that the wealthy merchant Omar ben Salaad sold the crab tins; Tintin tells Thomson and Thompson to discreetly investigate. Tintin tracks down the gang and saves the Captain, but they both become intoxicated by the fumes from wine barrels breached in a shootout with the villains. Haddock chases a gang-member from the cellar to an entrance behind a bookcase in Salaad's house. Upon sobering up, Tintin discovers a necklace of <b>a</b> <b>crab</b> with golden claws on the now-subdued owner of the wine cellar, Omar ben Salaad, and realizes that he {{is the leader of the}} drug cartel. Allan steals a boat and tries escaping, but Tintin captures him. The police arrest the gang and free the Japanese man, who introduces himself as Bunji Kuraki, a police detective who was trying to warn Tintin of the group he was up against. He had been investigating the sailor on Haddock's crew who drowned; the sailor was on the verge of bringing him opium before he was eliminated. Turning on the radio, Tintin learns that, thanks to him, the entire organisation of the Crab with the Golden Claws is behind bars.|$|E

25|$|When {{band members}} are marching in one {{direction}} but want to focus their sound in another, they may rotate their bodies at the waist, so that only the upper portion of the body faces {{in the direction of}} play. This is known as lateral marching, but is more commonly known as either shifting, traversing, or sliding. A lateral march is not a change in the direction of march, only in the direction the upper body faces. Percussion players, whose large drum harnesses often prevent them from twisting their torsos, and sometimes tuba and sousaphone players, instead uses <b>a</b> <b>crab</b> step when moving sideways. During <b>a</b> <b>crab</b> step, the musician crosses one leg over the other, either marching on the toes or rolling the foot sideways. Percussionists may also substitute roll step when their instruments would interfere with performing the high step.|$|E
25|$|Species {{other than}} blue crab are often caught {{incidentally}} in crab pots, including fish, turtles, conch, and other crab species. In Georgia, hermit crabs (Pagurus spp.), channeled whelk (Busycon canaliculatum), spider crabs (Libinia spp.), and stone crabs (Menippe mercenaria) {{were the most}} common species observed as bycatch in commercial crab pots. Of important concern is the diamondback terrapin, Malaclemys terrapin. The blue crab and diamondback terrapin have overlapping ranges along the East and Gulf coasts of the United States. Because the funnels in <b>a</b> <b>crab</b> pot are flexible, small terrapins may easily enter and become entrapped. Traps are checked every 24 hours or less, frequently resulting in drowning and death of terrapins. Crab pot bycatch may reduce local terrapin populations to less than half. To reduce terrapin entrapment, bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) may be installed {{on each of the}} funnels in <b>a</b> <b>crab</b> pot. BRDs effectively reduce bycatch (and subsequently mortality) of small terrapins without affecting blue crab catch.|$|E
25|$|In {{the arts}} of vase-painting and mosaic, Amphitrite was {{distinguishable}} from the other Nereids only by her queenly attributes. In works of art, both ancient ones and post-Renaissance paintings, Amphitrite is represented either enthroned beside Poseidon or driving {{with him in a}} chariot drawn by sea-horses (hippocamps) or other fabulous creatures of the deep, and attended by Tritons and Nereids.

50|$|When {{a female}} Sacculina is {{implanted}} in <b>a</b> male <b>crab</b> it will {{interfere with the}} crab's hormonal balance. This sterilizes it and changes the bodily layout of the crab to resemble that of <b>a</b> female <b>crab</b> by widening and flattening its abdomen, among other things. The female Sacculina then forces the crab's body to release hormones, causing it to act like <b>a</b> female <b>crab,</b> {{even to the point}} of performing female mating dances.|$|R
25|$|The Crab Nebula (catalogue designations M1, NGC 1952, Taurus A) is a {{supernova}} remnant {{in the constellation}} of Taurus. The now-current name is due to William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, who observed the object in 1840 using a 36-inch telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like <b>a</b> <b>crab.</b> Corresponding to a bright supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054, the nebula was observed later by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of mills existed {{along the length of}} the Annick Water, with only Cunninghamhead Mill still {{standing}} today (2006). The Corsehill Mills (corn and wool) were at Stewarton, powered by water from the Corsehill Burn, which arose from the Clerkland Burn. Lambroch Mill was located near Laigh Castleton Farm. Scroaggy or Fairliecrevoch Mill was a waulk mill for preparing cloth and existed until the 1960s, with its lade cutting across the large loop in the river near Ramstane. Downstream from Cunninghamhead was a sawmill and a corn mill existed in Perceton near the old church. Scroag or scrog is <b>a</b> <b>crab</b> apple or gnarled tree stumps in old Scots and this 'nickname' well describes the area where the mill stood.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Empire Arun {{was sold}} to Ormos Shipping Co, London and renamed Granlake. She {{was sold to}} Goulandris Bros, London later that year. Granlake was sold to the Compagnia Maritime del Este, Panama in 1949 and renamed Dryad, {{operating}} under the management of Goulandris Bros (Hellas) Ltd. in 1951, Dryad was sold to Hikari Kisen KK, Tokyo and renamed Shiranesan Maru. She was sold to Mitsi Kinkai Kisen KK, Tokyo in 1953 and then to Hokuyo Suisan KK, Tokyo in 1955. At this point she was in use as <b>a</b> <b>crab</b> cannery. In 1962, she was sold to Nichiro Gyogyo KK, Tokyo, who renamed her Dainichi Maru and used her as a shellfish cannery. In 1969, Dainichi Maru was sold for scrap, arriving at Utsumi-Machi on 9 August 1969.|$|E

25|$|One find of {{particular}} interest is an 8 by 11cm stone slab, found in the residential area on the eastern slope of Yodfat, covered {{on both sides with}} scratched drawings made by a pointed tool. One side depicts a building with a triangular roof upon a podium, a small tree and a harp, and is thought to portray a Nefesh (a traditional Judean mausoleum). The other side of the stone features <b>a</b> <b>crab,</b> the astrological symbol of the Hebrew month of Tammuz, {{on the first day of}} which Yodfat fell. The stone is believed to have been the work of a besieged Jew anticipating his own impending doom, and its likeness has been etched on a modern memorial to the defenders of Yodfat placed at the foot of the Roman siege ramp.|$|E
25|$|The pot is {{then brought}} {{on board the}} boat and the crew sorts the king crab. Any crab not meeting the {{regulation}} requirements are thrown back. The crabs are stored live in a holding tank until the boat reaches shore, where they are sold. If the weather becomes too cold the live crabs may freeze and burst. If they are left in the tank for too long they will harm and possibly kill {{each other as they}} can be cannibalistic. Even the rocking of the boat can cause damage to the crab, so boards are inserted in the holds to prevent excessive side-to-side movement. If <b>a</b> <b>crab</b> dies in the hold for any reason it releases toxins which can kill other crabs. If the crew fails to remove the dead crabs, they can poison the entire tank and ruin the catch.|$|E
25|$|Having {{attended}} art college, Mercury {{also designed}} Queen's logo, called the Queen crest, {{shortly before the}} release of the band's first album. The logo combines the zodiac signs of all four members: two lions for Leo (Deacon and Taylor), <b>a</b> <b>crab</b> for Cancer (May), and two fairies for Virgo (Mercury). The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion. There is also a crown inside the Q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous phoenix. The whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, particularly with the lion supporters. The original logo, as found on the reverse-side of the cover of the band's first album, was a simple line drawing. Later sleeves bore more intricate-coloured versions of the logo.|$|E
