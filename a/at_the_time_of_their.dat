40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether the circadian rhythm of circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 1 (IGFBP- 1) is evident <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery.

In <b>the</b> women sampled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery there was no evidence for any relationship between <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery and maternal or fetal levels of IGFBP- 1.

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the St Petersburg Conservatory, Prokofiev initially made his name as an iconoclastic composer-pianist, achieving notoriety {{with a series of}} ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument, including his first two piano concertos. In 1915 Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral Scythian Suite, compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes. Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev – Chout, Le pas d'acier and The Prodigal Son – which <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> original production all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues. Prokofiev's greatest interest, however, was opera, and he composed several works in that genre, including The Gambler and The Fiery Angel.

30|$|In addition, an {{assessment}} of the working situation requires various intertask relations to correctly estimate the working situation.

The movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> a collision resembles that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approach operation, but the semantic connection between the target object and <b>the</b> robot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> collision is different than that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approach operation.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Hospitalization can {{significantly}} disrupt sleeping patterns. considering {{the prevalence of}} insomnia and widespread use of benzodiazepines and other hypnotics in hospitalized patients, we conducted this study to assess the quality of sleep and hypnotic drug use in hospitalized adult patients in 2007. Materials & Methods: This descriptive analytical cross-sectional study involved an assessment of sleep quality for patients whose consent had been obtained when admitted to the internal ward of Hamadan Ekbatan hospital. The Pittsburg sleep quality index (PSQI) {{was used to measure}} the quality of sleep in patients and completed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission and discharge. Also the relation of factors such as age, sex. Marital status, education and sedating drug use prior to and during hospitalization with sleep quality were assessed. 300 patients entered this study and completed PSQI sleep questionnaires two twice, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission & discharge. Results: <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission only 36 % of patients had good sleep quality (PSQI score < 5) while this percent decreased to 18. 3 % <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> discharge. Mean global PSQI score was 7. 6 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission versus 9. 4 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> discharge indicating <b>the</b> patients’ worse sleep quality <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> discharge (Pv< 0. 05). 23 % of patients received hypnotic drugs while in the hospital with no evidence of preadmission hypnotic use.

Conclusion: Quality <b>of</b> sleep <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> discharge was significantly worse than it <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission and it seems that despite widespread use of sedative drug in the hospital, there are still patients with poor sleep quality in the hospital...|$|R
