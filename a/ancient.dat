In Tales of <b>Ancient</b> Greece Blyton retold sixteen well-known <b>ancient</b> Greek myths, but used the Latin rather than the Greek names of deities and invented conversations between the characters. The Adventures of Odysseus, Tales of the <b>Ancient</b> Greeks and Persians and Tales of the Romans followed in 1934.|$|E

5|$|While {{working in}} the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo's {{interest}} in archaeology and old relics led him to reconstruct an armillary sphere from existing models {{as well as from}} <b>ancient</b> texts that could provide additional information. Shen used <b>ancient</b> mirrors while conducting his optics experiments. He observed <b>ancient</b> weaponry, describing the scaled sight devices on <b>ancient</b> crossbows and the ancients' production of swords with composite blades that had a midrib of wrought iron and low-carbon steel while having two sharp edges of high-carbon steel. Being a knowledgeable musician, Shen also suggested suspending an <b>ancient</b> bell by using a hollow handle. In his assessment of the carved reliefs of the <b>ancient</b> Zhuwei Tomb, Shen stated that the reliefs demonstrate genuine Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) era clothing.|$|E
5|$|A {{combination}} of favorable geographical features {{contributed to the}} success of <b>ancient</b> Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The <b>ancient</b> Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. Land management was crucial in <b>ancient</b> Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that the <b>Ancients</b> are actually the [...] "first evolution" [...] of humanity, originating in a distant galaxy from the Milky Way. At {{some point in their}} races history, an ideological schism occurred between two factions who later became known as the <b>Ancients</b> and [...] "Ori", the former advocating the values of science and reason, while the latter championed religious devotion, respectively. This schism resulted from the threat the <b>Ancients</b> felt from the Ori's religious zeal, prompting a mass exodus by the <b>Ancients</b> from their home world via a large ship. After a presumably long voyage the <b>Ancients</b> arrived in the Milky Way galaxy where they colonized a number of planets, notably Earth. After tens of millions of years they emigrated to the Pegasus galaxy to survive, having seeded life in the Milky Way before they left. Upon returning to the Milky Way approximately ten million years later, the <b>Ancients</b> encountered an Earth populated by a new evolution of humanity, thus it is implied that the current human species evolved as such due to the actions of the <b>Ancients,</b> since two species progressing along identical evolutionary paths is extremely improbable.|$|R

5|$|Although {{above the}} horizon and hence visible to the <b>Ancient</b> Greeks, Antlia's stars were too faint to have been {{included}} in any <b>ancient</b> constellations. The stars that now comprise Antlia lay within an area of the sky covered by the <b>ancient</b> constellation Argo Navis, the Ship of the Argonauts, which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by Lacaille in 1763. Ridpath reports that due to their faintness, the stars of Antlia did not make up part of the classical depiction of Argo Navis.|$|E
5|$|An <b>ancient</b> {{solution}} to a flow problem is a curve whose evolution can be extrapolated backwards for all time, without singularities. All of the self-similar solutions that shrink or stay the same size rather than growing are <b>ancient</b> solutions in this sense; they can be extrapolated backwards by reversing the self-similarity transformation that they would undergo by the forwards curve-shortening flow. Thus, for instance, the circle, grim reaper, and Abresch–Langer curves are all <b>ancient</b> solutions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ancient</b> Egyptian deities are {{the gods}} and goddesses worshipped in <b>ancient</b> Egypt. The beliefs and rituals {{surrounding}} these gods formed the core of <b>ancient</b> Egyptian religion, which emerged sometime in prehistory. Deities represented natural forces and phenomena, and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to maat, or divine order. After {{the founding of the}} Egyptian state around 3100BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, who claimed to be the gods' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out.|$|E

Also highly respected are Nagools, i.e. bizarre, spiritual beings who protect the teachings of the <b>Ancients.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Wraith, over a vast period, {{developed}} into an advanced but violent society (with vestiges of territorialism that were later harshly revived when their prey became scarce) - {{all the while}} avoiding {{the attention of the}} <b>Ancients.</b> When the sentient Wraith were discovered by the <b>Ancients,</b> it appears their ferocity, belligerence and large population were underestimated. The <b>Ancients</b> sent a delegation protected by their most powerful warships to negotiate with the Wraith, but the ships were ambushed and destroyed. The <b>Ancients</b> and Wraith went to war, and despite the Ancients' technological superiority, the Wraith overwhelmed the <b>Ancients</b> with their sheer numbers. During their war which lasted for centuries, the Wraith eventually conquered every planet in the Pegasus Galaxy until only Atlantis, the capital of their empire, remained protected by its powerful city shield.|$|R

5000|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, the first {{evolution}} of humanity {{known as the}} Alterans (from Latin alteri, [...] "the others", though in canon, it descends from the <b>Ancient's</b> own language), lived in a distant unknown galaxy while proceeding along the evolutionary path to ascension. At the time, those who were later {{to be known as}} the Ori and the <b>Ancients</b> were not distinguished from each other, and lived in one society. However, a philosophical division emerged. Over time, the Ori grew more and more fervent in their religious belief, while the <b>Ancients</b> adopted a more scientific outlook. Ultimately, their viewpoints diverged so much that the two groups split apart and began to oppose each other, culminating in the Ori attempting to destroy the <b>Ancients.</b> Instead of going to war, the <b>Ancients</b> decided to leave their galaxy, and began searching for a new home. The Ori later used their departure to their advantage, including their departure in the Book of Origin, claiming that the mountain the <b>Ancients</b> leveled while leaving contained evil and that it was buried as the mountain collapsed.|$|R

50|$|After {{arriving}} in the Pegasus Galaxy, the <b>Ancients</b> settled on a planet they named 'Lantea', calling themselves 'Lanteans' from that time forward (also, they have {{been referred to as}} 'Atlanteans' by members of the Atlantis Expedition - a name often used by the peoples of Pegasus to describe the expedition members). Finding Pegasus devoid of sentient life, the <b>Ancients</b> dispersed humans and Stargates across their new home galaxy, protecting the newly populated planets and occasionally inhabiting them (usually concealing their true identities as <b>Ancients).</b> The humans seeded by the <b>Ancients</b> came to know them as 'the Ancestors'. At some point they encountered a leech-like organism called the 'Iratus bug', which possessed impressive healing and immunological capabilities. Through feeding on humans (and processes of evolution), this organism absorbed genetic information from humans and eventually evolved into the vampire-like Wraith. Although it remains unknown precisely how this evolution occurred, the <b>Ancients</b> have confirmed that they were responsible for the species' emergence.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Ancients</b> (in {{their own}} tongue Anquietas) are a fictional {{humanoid}} {{race in the}} Stargate franchise.
