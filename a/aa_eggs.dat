40|$|In 1990, a Salmonella enteritidis (SE) {{outbreak}} {{occurred in}} a restaurant chain in Pennsylvania. To determine its cause(s), we conducted a case-control study and a cohort study at one restaurant, and a survey of restaurants. Egg dishes were associated with illness (P = 0. 03). Guests from one hotel eating at the restaurant had a diarrhoeal attack rate of 14 %, 4. 7 -fold higher than among those not eating there (P = 0. 04). There were no differences in egg handling between affected and unaffected restaurants. Eggs supplied to affected restaurants were medium grade <b>AA</b> <b>eggs</b> from a single farm, and were reportedly refrigerated during distribution. Human and hen SE isolates were phage type 8 and had similar plasmid profiles and antibiograms. We estimate the prevalence of infected eggs during the outbreak to {{be as high as}} 1 in 12. Typical restaurant egg-handling practices and refrigeration during distribution appear to be insufficient by themselves to prevent similar outbreaks...|$|E
40|$|Dose-dependent {{positive}} effects on hatchability and hatchling weight {{have been attributed to}} ascorbic acid (<b>AA)</b> when <b>eggs</b> were submitted or not to intermittent heat stress during incubation. Fertile breeder (Cobb(r)) eggs were used to determine if the pre-incubation injection of AA in ovo affects the incubation and hatchling quality of egg incubated under thermoneutral or intermittent heat stress conditions. Eggs were not injected or injected with 0, 2, 4, or 6 % AA/ 100 µL water and incubated at continuous thermoneutral (37. 5 ºC) or hot (39. 0 ºC) temperature. Eggshell temperature (EST) increased {{in the second half of}} the incubation period in all experimental groups. The EST of non-injected eggs and of those injected with water was higher when incubated at 39 °C than at 37. 5 °C, but EST was not different among <b>eggs</b> injected with <b>AA.</b> <b>Egg</b> mass loss and eggshell conductance were higher in the eggs incubated at 39 °C than at 37. 5 °C. Hatchability was lower in the <b>eggs</b> injected with <b>AA.</b> Liver and yolk sac weights were higher, whereas heart and liver weights were lower in hatchlings from eggs incubated at 39 °C; however, hatchling weight was not affected by incubation temperature.

The basal diet (150 g AA g- 1) {{was compared to}} low (150), medium (450) and high (1, 350 AA g g- 1) AA supplementation. Dietary AA content was obtained using combinations of unenriched and AA-enriched Artemia {{in combination with the}} basal diet. Supplementation resulted in ovarian AA saturation at ~ 240 g g- 1, increasing ovarian content by 160 %. Digestive gland concentrations were 76 - 92 g AA g- 1 for diets containing  450 g AA g- 1, but reached 270 g AA g- 1 for the high supplement. The considerable AA store in tail muscle appeared to be translocated to the ovary during maturation. There was no significant <b>AA</b> depletion in <b>eggs</b> during embryogenesis suggesting minimal AA utilization during this phase.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} eval-uate the effect of in ovo amino acid (AA) injections in broiler breeder <b>eggs</b> on <b>AA</b> utilization of embryos. All AA used in these {{experiments were}} pure crystalline AA in free-base form.

40|$|Mating {{triggers}} {{behavioral and}} physiological {{changes in the}} Drosophila melanogaster female, including an elevation of egg laying. Seminal fluid molecules from the male accessory gland are responsible for initial behavioral changes, but persistence of these changes requires stored sperm. Using genetic analysis, we have identified a seminal fluid protein {{that is responsible for}} an initial elevation of egg laying. This molecule, Acp 26 Aa, has structural features of a prohormone and contains a region with amino acid similarity to the egg-laying hormone of Aplysia. Acp 26 Aa is transferred to the female during mating, where it undergoes processing. Here we report the generation and analysis of mutants, including a null, in Acp 26 Aa. Females mated to male flies that lack Acp 26 <b>Aa</b> lay fewer <b>eggs</b> than do mates of normal males. This effect is apparent only on the first day after mating.

40|$|Eggs from a broiler {{breeder flock}} between 25 and 29 weeks of age were dipped into {{solutions}} of various concentrations of ascorbic acid (AA) {{for up to}} 2 min, in order to evaluate its effects on eggshell conductance (EC), amniotic fluid pH, albumen height and pH, embryonic weight and hatchability. 2. Three experiments were conducted and the following treatments were used: control, non-dipped (CND); control, water-dipped (CWD); 10 g AA/l (AA 1); 20 g AA/l (AA 2) and 30 g AA/l (AA 3). Measurements of EC before and after dipping were made in experiments 1 and 2 in eggs from hens at 25 and 27 weeks of age, respectively. Albumen height and pH were measured after dipping the eggs in experiment 2. In experiment 3, egg weight loss, embryonic weight and amniotic fluid pH at 14 d of age, hatchability percentage (HP), and embryonic mortality were measured in eggs from hens at 29 weeks of age. 3. <b>AA</b> treatment of <b>eggs</b> and dipping period of time (1, 1 • 5 and 2 min) increased EC of eggs from hens at 25 and 27 weeks of age. 4. AA 3 treatment for 2 min reduced albumen height and increased albumen pH of eggs {{when compared with the}} CND treatment in eggs from hens at 27 weeks of age. 5. HP of <b>AA</b> 1 -treated <b>eggs</b> from hens at 29 weeks of age was higher than that of the CND treatment. AA 2 and AA 3 treatments of eggs reduced HP and increased the percentage of non-pips when compared with any of the other treatments. 6.

Dipping treatment did not influence amniotic fluid pH or embryo weight expressed as a percentage of initial egg weight. 7. It is concluded that dipping hatching <b>eggs</b> into <b>AA</b> solution increased EC of eggs. Dipping eggs into 10 g AA/l for a period of 2 min increased HP in eggs from hens at 29 weeks of age, although this was not associated with a significant ncrease in egg weight loss...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of in-ovo ascorbic acid (AA) injection on the bone development of broilers submitted to heat stress during incubation and rearing. One thousand (1, 000) Cobb(r) fertile broiler eggs were randomly distributed according to the weight into five incubators, with 200 eggs per incubator. The incubation treatments were: eggs not injected with AA and incubated at 37. 5 °C; eggs not injected with AA and incubated at 39 °C; and eggs injected with 6 µg AA/ 100 µL water prior to incubation and incubated at 39 ºC. The hatched birds were reared at three different house temperatures: cold, thermoneutral, or and hot. The high incubation temperature negatively influenced broilers' bone characteristics. The femur of the birds hatched from eggs incubated at 39 °C and injected with AA presented lower shaft mineral density, lower maximum force and lower elongation at maximum force. Their tibia presented reduced mineral density at the proximal and distal epiphysis. In-ovo <b>AA</b> injection of <b>eggs</b> incubated at high temperature did not minimize {{the negative effects of}} high rearing temperature on the performance andbone development of broiler chickens reared until 42 days of age...|$|R
40|$|Empty capsids of {{the human}} {{pathogenic}} parvovirus B 19 can be produced in a baculovirus system. B 19 capsids are composed mainly of major capsid protein (VP 2) and {{a small amount of}} minor capsid protein (VP 1); VP 1 is identical to VP 2 but contains an additional 227 -aa N-terminal region ("unique" region). A portion of that region of VP 1 is external to the capsid, and VP 1 is not required for capsid formation. We substituted the unique region with a sequence encoding the 147 <b>aa</b> of hen <b>egg</b> white lysozyme (HEL) and constructed recombinant baculoviruses with variable amounts of retained VP 1 sequence joined to the VP 2 backbone. After cotransfection with VP 2 baculovirus and expression in insect cells, capsids were purified by density sedimentation. Purified recombinant capsids contained HEL. External presentation of HEL was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation, ELISA, and immune electron microscopy using anti-lysozyme monoclonal antibodies or specific rabbit antisera. Empty particles showed enzymatic activity in a micrococcal cell wall digestion assay. Rabbits inoculated with capsids made antibodies to HEL. Intact heterologous protein can be incorporated in B 19 particles and presented on the capsid surface, properties that may be useful in vaccine development, cell targeting, and gene therapy...|$|R
40|$|This study reports {{changes in}} ascorbic acid (<b>AA)</b> in {{anchoveta}} <b>eggs,</b> copepods and zooplankton during the 2006, 2007 and 2009 main spawning {{seasons in the}} coastal area of the central Humboldt Current System, Chile. Anchoveta eggs, copepods and total zooplankton community shared a seasonal variation and an increasing trend in AA concentration from winter through spring which {{was associated with the}} spring diatom bloom. The lineal relationship observed between AA concentration in anchoveta eggs, chlorophyll a and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) suggests that the increase in phytoplankton abundance could also increase the amount of AA in the spawning female anchoveta incorporated through tissue, thus increasing the concentration in their eggs. Ascorbic acid concentrations in copepods presented size (weight) dependence. Small copepods (e. g. Acartia, Oithona) had AA concentrations two orders of magnitude higher than the heavier weight class copepods (e. g. Calanus, Rhincalanus). Results of the determination of glutathione and the antioxidant potential showed a similar trend in interannual variations, suggesting that cold SST conditions observed in the 2007 spawning season could increase the consumption of antioxidants in early stages. Potential connections between AA concentration in the food web on anchoveta reproduction and egg hatching and embryo malformations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} quantify the nitrogen (N) and amino acid (AA) digestibility of various protein sources fed to growing pigs. The protein ingredients were sunflower meal, cottonseed meal, canola meal, camelina meal, egg albumen, casein, blood meal, plasma meal, potato protein concentrate, soy protein concentrate, soy protein isolate, and linseed meal, which were fed as the sole source of amino acids for the animals and were included in semi-purified, corn starch-based diets. A semi-purified, nitrogen-free diet (NFD) was used to estimate endogenous losses of AA. In each experiment, pigs were surgically fitted with a simple T-cannula at the distal ileum and fed four experimental diets and the NFD based on a 5 X 2 crossover arrangement in a randomized crossover design, with 5 diets and 2 periods. For experiment 1 (Exp. 1), sunflower meal, cottonseed meal, canola meal, and camelina meal were fed to 19, 42 -kg barrows to determine the apparent (AID) and standardized (AID) digestibility of AA at the terminal ileum. The AID and SID of N and all AA were greatest for sunflower meal (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), and canola meal had similar AID and SID of N, Met, Thr, Leu, and Val. The AID and SID of all essential AA, except for Met and Trp, was lower in camelina meal than sunflower meal (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Cottonseed meal had lower AID and SID of Lys, Ile, Leu, Met, Thr, and Val {{compared to the other}} protein sources (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). In experiment 2 (Exp. 2), egg albumen, casein, blood meal, and plasma meal were fed to 20, 20 -kg barrows to determine the AID and SID of N and AA. The AID and SID of N and indispensable AA was greatest for casein compared to the other ingredients (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Blood meal, plasma meal, and egg albumen had similar AID and SID of many <b>AA.</b> <b>Egg</b> albumen had the greatest AID and SID of Cys among ingredients, while plasma meal had greater AID and SID of Thr than blood meal (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). For experiment 3 (Exp. 3), potato concentrate, soy concentrate, soy isolate, and linseed meal were fed to 20, 25 -kg barrows. The AID and SID of N was similar for potato concentrate, soy concentrate, and soy isolate and greater than linseed meal (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The AID and SID of Leu and Thr were greater in potato protein concentrate than soy concentrate (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), and AID and SID of Thr was lower in soy isolate than potato concentrate. The apparent and standardized digestibility of all essential amino acids was similar between soy isolate and soy concentrate, and only the AID and SID of Asp was greater in soy isolate than soy concentrate (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Linseed meal had the lowest AID and SID of N and AA digestibility among protein sources (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in this experiment. In conclusion, animal protein and plant protein concentrates had the highest AID and SID of N and AA, and the digestibility of N and AA vary greatly among oilseed meals. ^ As more grain by-products and alternative feed ingredients are being fed to livestock, researchers are determining the impact that fibrous components have on nutrient digestibility. Two {{experiments were}} conducted to determine the impact that different types of fiber have on the energy, nitrogen (N), and amino acid (AA) digestibility of soybean meal fed to growing pigs. In both studies, soybean meal served as the predominant form of amino acids for the animals, as the fibrous ingredients added little protein to the semi-purified, corn-starch based diets. A semi-purified, nitrogen-free diet (NFD) was used to estimate endogenous flows of AA. Pigs were surgically fitted with a simple T-cannula at the distal ileum and fed four experimental diets and the NFD on a 5 × 2 crossover arrangement in a randomized crossover design, with 5 diets and 2 periods. For experiment 1 (Exp. 1), soybean meal (SBM), SBM + corn hulls, SBM + rice hulls, and SBM + wheat straw were fed to 19, 45 -kg barrows to determine apparent (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of N and AA at the terminal ileum, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of energy and N, and apparent hindgut digestibility (AHD) of energy and N. Rice hulls reduced the AID and SID of N, Arg, Ile, Thr, Trp, and Cys compared to the control and corn fiber diets and had lower AID of N and Glu and SID of N and Leu compared to the wheat straw diet (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Wheat straw decreased the AID of Thr and Val compared to the control diet (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), but did not inhibit the SID of AA. The AID and SID of N and AA between the control and corn fiber diet were similar in the study. The inclusion of rice hulls reduced the AID of energy and N, the ATTD of energy, and the HAD of energy compared to the control group (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The AID, ATTD, and AHD of energy was lower in pigs fed wheat straw compared to the control diet (P 3 ̆c 0. 05); however, wheat straw did not influence N digestibility. The AID, ATTD, and HAD of N and energy of corn fiber was similar to the control. For experiment 2 (Exp. 2), sugar beet pulp was fed at four different inclusion levels (0 g/kg, 100 g/kg, 200 g/kg, and 300 g/kg) in soybean meal, cornstarch-based diets to 20, 35 -kg barrows. Sugar beet pulp inclusion reduced the AID and SID of N and all indispensable and dispensable AA compared to the control diet (linear, P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The AID of energy and N were significantly reduced with sugar beet pulp was fed (linear and quadratic, P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Sugar beet pulp further reduced the ATTD of energy (linear and quadratic, P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and N (linear, P 3 ̆c 0. 05). There were no differences in AHD of energy and nitrogen among treatments. In conclusion, the SID and AID of N and AA and ATTD of energy and N is uniquely impacted by the source and inclusion level of fiber in diets fed to growing pigs. ...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated that feeding a diet {{with a high}} amino acid (60 % AA diet) content, as a mixture simulating casein, induced pancreatic growth and pancreatic protease production in rats. In the present study, we {{examined the effects of}} an increasing dietary content of essential amino acids (EAA, x 1 - x 3 in exp. 1 and x 1 - x 3. 3 in exp. 2) and non-essential amino acids (NEAA, x 1 - x 3 in exp. 1 and x 1 - x 5. 2 in exp. 2) on pancreatic growth, amylase and protease adaptation using casein-type amino acid mixtures (exp. 1, basal diet; 20 % <b>AA</b> diet) and <b>egg</b> white-type amino acid mixtures (exp. 2, basal diet; 12 % AA diet). Pancreatic growth and trypsin activity were induced as the dietary content of NEAA was increased in experiments 1 and 2. Amylase activity in the pancreas was also induced as the dietary content of NEAA was increased, even with the decrease in dietary carbohydrate in experiment 2. The values of all pancreatic variables decreased with the increase in dietary EAA (x 2 and x 3) without an increase in NEAA. The changes in the pancreas were coincident with increases in plasma arginine and lysine concentrations and a decrease in the plasma alanine concentration. In rats fed a 60 % AA diet (EAA and NEAA x 3), in the case of which the EAA content was balanced with the NEAA content, pancreatic growth and protease production increased and reached maximum levels as the plasma amino acid concentrations decreased, except for alanine. These results show that NEAA, not EAA, are associated with induction of pancreatic growth and protease production upon feeding a diet with a high AA content, and that some metabolites may be involved in the induction process. The suppression of pancreatic growth and protease production in rats fed the high EAA diets without balanced NEAA may be associated with impairment of amino acid metabolism rather than the increments in the concentration of one or more essential amino acids. Our results also suggest that there is an unknown mechanism or unknown factors involved in regulating pancreatic amylase...|$|R
40|$|Freshly laid chicken {{eggs are}} {{saturated}} with carbon dioxide of which approximately 40 % is quickly lost {{within a few}} hours of laying. A high CO 2 content positively influences the quality and safety of eggs. Hence, it is important to maintain CO 2 in eggs. Exposure of chicken eggs to a high temperature {{for an extended period of}} time increases the rate of CO 2 loss. Traditional egg cooling methods require 5 to 7 days to cool eggs from 35 °C at laying to the required 7 °C. In comparison, rapid cooling using liquid CO 2 is able to cool eggs within minutes, and it replaces any CO 2 loss since laying. ^ The goal of this research was to assess the influence of CO 2 on the safety and quality of shell eggs. The first objective was to determine the effect of CO 2 on the lytic activity of both purified and unpurified (egg white) lysozyme at four pH conditions (4. 5, 6. 5, 8. 0 and 9. 5) and two temperatures (5 °C and 22 °C). The second objective was rapid cooling shell eggs using liquid CO 2 and evaluating its effect on quality over 12 weeks of refrigerated storage. The two objectives were carried out as separate experiments. ^ For experiment one, the activity of lysozyme was assessed on bacterial cells, Micrococcus lysodeikticus. Results showed that lysozyme was always more active at 22 °C as compared to 5 °C. Also, purified egg white lysozyme activity was greater than that of egg white with equal lysozyme content. The highest lytic activity was found at pH 6. 5 and 22 °C. CO 2 treatment increased lytic activity under all cases except at pH 9. 5. At pH 4. 5, the addition of CO 2 increased lytic activity of purified lysozyme by more than 50 % at both temperatures. At pH 6. 5 a slight reduction in lysozyme activity was observed with carbonation; however, it was not significant at 5 °C. At pH 8. 0, lytic activity increased by over 100 % at 5 °C and 23 - 100 % at 22 °C. At pH 9. 5, lytic activity without CO 2 addition was high; however, carbonation completely eliminated lytic activity. Thus, CO 2 treatment may influence lysozyme activity. ^ In the second experiment, cooling conditions were optimized to achieve a 7 °C egg center temperature after cooling and equilibration. Three cooling conditions which met this condition were selected for further comparison in CO 2 uptake evaluation: 18 min at - 45 °C (treatment A); 15 min at - 60 °C (treatment B) and 12 min at - 75 °C (treatment C). For quality evaluations all treatments were compared to the control, which was traditionally cooled to 7 °C. Results showed that rapid cooling significantly increased Haugh Unit value of eggs (HU 76 - 78) compared to control (HU 71. 8). Rapidly cooled eggs had 116 % more <b>AA</b> grades <b>eggs</b> compared to traditionally cooled eggs over the 12 weeks of refrigerated storage. Yolk and albumen pH were not found to be significantly different between the control and the treatments, except treatment C for which the yolk pH was significantly lower than the rest through out the 12 week study. Rapidly cooled eggs (approximately 1. 8 mg/g albumen) maintained a significantly higher CO 2 content than traditionally cooled eggs (1. 3 mg/g albumen) over the 12 weeks of storage. Rapid cooling with liquid CO 2 significantly increased the vitelline membrane strength (VMS). The VMS of the traditionally cooled eggs decreased by 50 % over the 12 weeks of storage whereas the rapidly cooled eggs showed a high VMS throughout. Overall, results indicated that rapid cooling using liquid CO 2 maintained egg quality and extended the shelf life of eggs up to 12 weeks. ...|$|R
