In a {{realm of}} aggressively {{anthropomorphic}} canines, some of whom, admittedly, have strong speech impediments, he doesn’t talk or wisecrack or engage in shenanigans.

500|$|In 2008, the {{broadcast}} earned Timberlake an Emmy Award {{in the category}} Outstanding Picture Editing For A Special (Single Or Multi-Camera). For Timberlake's performance of [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] at the Madison Square Garden, Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine ranked it second on its list of top ten live performances in 2007. Tyrangiel writes, [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> long side, but Timberlake earns this symphonic take on What Goes Around from his HBO special." [...] On October 31, 2007, Billboard magazine announced the finalists for the 2007 Billboard Touring Awards, {{which was based on}} actual box office performance from January 1, 2007, to September 30, 2007. Timberlake was nominated in the categories Top Tour, Top Draw and Breakthrough Artist; he won the latter that was announced during the awards show on November 15, 2007.|$|E
500|$|In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held {{until his}} death. Professor R.L. Brett, who was {{chairman}} of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, [...] "At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again." [...] For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows. Of the city itself Larkin commented: [...] "I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of things, I think even its natives would say that. I rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places." [...] In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{their arrival}} at Elstree Studios, Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind were shown {{the first version}} of the film by Kubrick: [...] "The film was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> long side. There were great gobs of scenes that never made it to the film. There was a whole strange and mystical scene in which Jack Nicholson discovers objects that have been {{arranged}} in his working space in the ballroom with arrows and things. He walks down and thinks he hears a voice and a ghost throws a ball back to him. None of that made it to the final film. We scored a lot of those. We didn't know what was going to be used for sure". Carlos has said that she was so disillusioned by Kubrick's actions that she vowed never to work with him again. Her own music was released in its near entirety in 2005 as part of her Rediscovering Lost Scores compilation.|$|E
2500|$|No one {{was really}} safe from {{scrutiny}} or the chopping block, ultimately not even Robespierre himself. This omnipresent sense of fear inspired many of lesser means to flee France, often without much preparation and therefore no money or helpful belongings. Those who left France were a heterogeneous bunch socioeconomically and professionally, although {{the vast majority}} of migrants were men. While these people came from diverse financial backgrounds, they all more or less suffered the same poverty while traveling. In his thesis [...] "'La Généreuse Nation!' Britain and the French Emigration 1792-1802", Callum Whittaker recounts that while leaving France one aristocrat [...] "disguised herself as a sailor, and hid for a day in the hold of a ship underneath a pile of ropes". [...] Also, captains and sailors saw {{this as an opportunity to}} earn <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side, and so they levied taxes on the emigrants, leaving them on the shores of another nation with nothing. Yet still, thousands chose this path of discomfort and destitution because it at least provided the promise of peace.|$|E

2500|$|In 1874: [...] "Another, if possible, {{still more}} {{beautiful}} day, after a slight frost. — After writing started at 11 with Beatrice to try & {{walk up to}} the falls of the Glassalt, which I had not done since 20 years! There was not a breath of wind & a very powerful sun. I managed to get up & was wonderfully little out of breath. Brown helped me up the steepest parts, which are rather trying. The falls were not particularly full, but always very fine. I walked up to the very top, just above, them, & rested <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> heather. The descent was far easier, but the path was very rough in parts & I had recourse to Brown's strong arm to steady me. It is 4 miles to the top & back, & I felt quite proud, that I could accomplish it so well. — In the afternoon drove with Beatrice & Janie E. nearly as far as Birkhall & back, taking our tea at the Linn of Muich. A splendid frosty evening." [...] Likewise in 1877: [...] "Walked with Beatrice {{up to the top of}} the Glassalt falls, where the icicles where hanging ...|$|E
2500|$|Most pulque is {{consumed}} in bars called pulquerías. At {{the beginning of}} the 20th century, more than 1,000 were located in Mexico City alone. By the early 20th century, pulquerías became socially accepted, and some were places of great elegance. But whether for rich or poor, two features stood out among these establishments: odd or catchy names, and murals decorating the walls. Names included (translated) [...] "My Office", [...] "Memories of the Future", [...] "Drink and Go", I'm Waiting for You Here at the Corner", and, {{across the street from the}} National Chamber of Deputies, [...] "The Recreation Center of Those Across the Street". Diego Rivera once said one of the most important manifestations of Mexican painting was the murals that decorated the facades and interiors of pulquerías. One tradition maintained at all pulquerias at {{the beginning of the}} 20th century was to put sawdust on the floor. The tradition at that time was to begin a pulque-drinking session by spilling <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor or ground as an offering to Mother Earth. [...] Traditional pulquerías tend to be like clubs with closed membership, with casual visitors ignored or sometimes stared at. Frequent visits and large consumption of the drink tends to win acceptance. While some establishments may forbid women, it is much more common for the establishment to provide a separate seating area for them. Intermingling of the sexes is not permitted. In the more rural areas of Hidalgo and Tlaxcala, where most pulque is made, the pulque is fresher and better. A vendor usually displays a white flag over the door when a fresh shipment has arrived.|$|E
