Thus, the novel and demanding task of comparing the human and environmental risks of different products would be limited to the lowest possible number of cases. On the other hand, however, it must be taken into consideration that the agronomic part of the assessment includes criteria that need further interpretation and specification, in particular the requirement for no ‘significant’ economic or practical disadvantages. Corresponding definitions of significance may be based on isolated agronomic considerations, but it is also imaginable, that the assessment of the significance of economic disadvantages should take account of potential advantages for human health and the environment. Thus, the number of cases for comparative human and environmental risk assessments will depend on the detailed criteria and procedural arrangements of the overall process.|$|E

Second generation biofuels (SGBs), which are produced from lignocellulosic material such as wheat straw, are currently being developed. This project investigated wheat straw supply for SGB production, focusing on the use of dual-purpose cultivars (DPCs) that are optimised to provide for both food and SGB markets. The project consisted of: <b>agronomic</b> <b>assessment</b> of cultivars and management practices for traits associated with a DPC; economic assessment of the value of these DPCs to farmers and costs of straw delivery; life cycle assessment for quantifying environmental burdens associated with straw production from DPCs; and a farmer survey for quantifying current straw supply and potential future straw supply should a new market for straw emerge. Agronomic trials did not identify any outstanding candidates for use as DPCs from currently grown wheat cultivars or any management practices that would benefit DPC traits. Economic assessment found that straw production costs were lower than the straw price but the overall straw gross margins were much lower than grain gross margins suggesting that grain yield would not be traded off against increased straw yield.

Inorganic N fertilizer {{is perhaps the most}} important factor affecting SOC within maize-based systems due to its effects on crop residue production and SOC mineralization. Using a continuous maize cropping system with a 13 year N fertilizer gradient (0 – 269 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1) that created a large range in crop residue inputs (3. 60 – 9. 94 Mg dry matter ha− 1 yr− 1), we provide the first <b>agronomic</b> <b>assessment</b> of long-term N fertilizer effects on SOC with direct reference to N rates that are empirically determined to be insufficient, optimum, and excessive. Across the N fertilizer gradient, SOC in physico-chemically protected pools was not affected by N fertilizer rate or residue inputs. However, unprotected particulate organic matter (POM) fractions increased with residue inputs. Although N fertilizer was negatively linearly correlated with POM C/N ratios, the slope of this relationship decreased from the least decomposed POM pools (coarse POM) to the most decomposed POM pools (fine intra-aggregate POM). Moreover, C/N ratios of protected pools did not vary across N rates, suggesting little effect of N fertilizer on soil organic matter (SOM) after decomposition of POM. Comparing a N rate within 4 % of agronomic optimum (208 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1) and an excessive N rate (269 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1), there were no differences between SOC amount, SOM C/N ratios, or microbial biomass and composition.

40|$|Spring {{field pea}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} coarse legumes. In most pea breeding programs, the selection process is focused on the development of high-yielding and top-quality varieties for grain and/or green forage production. Production of protein rich grain is mainly associated with spring varieties, while production of green mass rich in protein, minerals and vitamins is characteristic for winter varieties. Due to problems with planting in autumn (late harvest of previous crop, heavy rains during soil preparation and planting, business plan modifications, abundance of cattle etc.), farmers often prefer spring pea varieties that can produce large green mass over shorter period of time, as well as ensure planting of the next crop in the same field.

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the impact of root and stolon rots on white clover commenced in July 1995 and concluded in June 1998. This involved a survey of root and stolon disease over three seasons and the isolation of fungal and nematode species that were detected in the plant tissue and in the surrounding soil. The fungal isolates found were then subsequently tested for pathogenicity on white clover seedlings and adult plants. The project aimed to: (i) develop methods for root and stolon rot disease monitoring and assessment, (ii) determine and quantify the impact of root and stolon rot diseases on white clover dairy pasture production, and (iii) identify fungi that invade root and stolons of white clover in pastures and test their pathogenicity. In order to properly describe and identify rots on roots and stolons, descriptive symptom codes were developed with collaborators in New South Wales and New Zealand. These codes were used as standards in order to describe the status of stolons and root in all studies conducted during this project. In a field experiment {{used to evaluate the}} effect of selective fungicides and a nematicide on white clover decline there were usually no effects of treatments on pasture dry matter production or white clover content. Also <b>agronomic</b> <b>assessments</b> suggest application of fungicides and a nematicide did not increase total dry matter production. In the later stages of the experiment (mid year 2 - year 3), the application of fungicides reduced (P< 0. 05) dry matter production relative to the control. Within the first two to three weeks after the last or previous chemical applications, pasture dry matter and white clover content were higher (P< 0. 05), and stolon and root rot diseases were reduced (P< 0. 05) in either the fungicides alone, nematicide alone or the combination compared to the untreated control. The nematicide treatment showed significantly higher white clover content than the other treatments. There was no association between root and stolon rot diseases and either pasture dry matter or white clover content throughout the experimental period. A pathogenicity test for seedlings of white clover was developed and proved to be an ideal method to rapidly determine the pathogenicity of large numbers of fungi. This is the first time the author has noted this method used on white clover exclusively. Of 400 fungi isolated, 350 isolates were tested on seedlings and six week old white clover plants for their ability to cause disease. Rhizoctonia spp. and Fusarium spp. (including F. oxysporum, F. subglutinans, and F. solani) were among the highly pathogenic fungi. The pathogenicity tests provided evidence of fungi as a cause of white clover root rot. A photographic study of the rots on stolons of white clover found that most of the fungi tested infected the stolons when they were wounded. Only Rhizoctonia spp. Group 2 and Fusarium oxysporum had the capacity to form lesions on non-wounded stolons. Nematodes found in the field study included Helicotylenchus spp., Psilenchus spp., Quinisulcius spp., Heterodera trifola, Tylenchus spp. and Tylencholamius spp. Nematicide application reduced populations of Helicotylenchus spp. and Tylenchus spp. relative to the untreated control. The increase in pasture dry matter production in the nematicide treatment indicated that these ecoparasites could have a role in the root disease complex. The severity of root and stolon rot symptoms was not correlated with dry matter production or pasture composition. Results obtained from this research suggest "root and stolon diseases caused by soilborne fungi do not reduce the productivity of white clover in dairy pastures". It is more likely that white clover decline is pnmarily induced by abiotic stresses that act as predisposing factors for a secondary invasion by soilborne fungi. Nematodes, in addition to the damage they cause on their own, also provide entry points for secondary invading soilborne fungi.

An <b>assessment</b> of genetic diversity in crop germplasm collections can assist in the choice of parents for genetic mapping populations and subsequent marker-assisted selection. Genotyping individuals and cultivars within germplasm collections can help breeders narrow the search for new alleles at loci of interest and assist in the identification of ‘perfect’ marker alleles from candidate genes that can then be introduced into new varieties along with their associated desirable traits. Genotypic information from germplasm collections can be used to assign lines and populations to heterotic groups; to study the evolutionary history of wild relatives; to verify pedigrees and fill in the gaps in incomplete pedigree or selection history and to monitor changes in allele frequencies in cultivars or populations. Towards the application of genetic diversity analysis to germplasm improvement, we have characterised within and between line genetic diversity in an international germplasm collection, consisting of over 100 B. napus and B. juncea lines, using genomic and EST (expressed sequence tag) derived Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) molecular markers. Further genetic diversity analysis has been performed on related germplasm from 17 lines maintained in the UK along with 30 B. napus cultivars grown commercially in Australia.

40|$|Biochar is {{a carbon}} dense solid that is {{produced}} via the pyrolysis of organic materials for application to soil. Organic carbon structures, {{such as those}} found in animal manures or wood, are modified by exposure to elevated temperatures in an oxygen-limited environment. This processing causes a loss of mass through a preferential loss of hydrogen along {{with a loss of}} volatile carbon molecules. The carbon remaining in the solid forms stable, conjugated aromatic structures, which are more recalcitrant to degradation in the natural environment than the pre-processed feedstock material. The surface area of the biochar material is also greatly increased compared to the feedstock, especially at the micropore scale. The mineral ash content of the original organic materials is preserved in the biochar, increasing in concentration with the loss of volatile components of the feedstock. Biochar production and use offers many opportunities for enhancing soil properties and sequestering carbon. The evidence to support the application of biochar as a soil amendment to enhance crop productivity is growing. Its potential as a carbon reservoir, able to sequester carbon in soils, and hence reduce atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases is a relatively new area of scientific investigation, on which lies significant sociopolitical interest due to the agenda to find cost effective climate change solutions. This thesis makes a significant contribution to the field of biochar production and use in developing several aspects of its physical characterization, environmental sustainability, risks, and opportunities. The investigation builds the evidence and methods required to understand the potential contribution biochar can make to atmospheric greenhouse gas reduction and agricultural sustainability. Key findings include a comprehensive review of the physical characteristics of biochars and how they are influenced by processing conditions and feedstocks choice. Also, the discovery and investigation of Terra Preta Australis sites, which provide an Australian analogy to the Terra Preta de Indio soils, that provide a case study demonstrating the long-term impact on soil properties and potential for carbon sequestration in that environment. Other major outcomes from the work include the development of risk assessment and greenhouse gas accounting methodologies that can be applied to biochar production and use.

Marker assisted selection was used to rapidly develop barley germplasm with novel combinations of alleles at loci controlling starch synthesis and growth habit. The target loci were WAX, VRN-H 1, and VRN-H 2. The goal was to develop waxy starch, high grain β-glucan, and winter habit germplasm. Pre-screening of candidate parental lines identified combinations with target vrn-H 1 (winter) alleles. This allowed for immediate fixation of favorable alleles at this locus. VRN-H 1 is coincident with a major low temperature tolerance QTL (Fr 1). Perfect markers were based on functional domains in GBSSI and ZCCT-H, the genes determining wax and VRN-H 2. Because spring growth habit at VRN-H 2 is due to gene deletion, codominant alleles at a tightly linked locus (HvSNF 2), were also used. Backcross-derived germplasm was genotyped in two stages. Homozygotes at the two loci were identified in one-step screening in the progeny of the double cross. BC 1 F 3 and DCF 3 lines were advanced to field testing in the Fall of 2007.

40|$|Three {{separate}} but related experiments {{were carried out}} to evaluate factors affecting the utilization of slurry N applied to grassland, and the acceptability of herbage to grazing cattle. Particular {{emphasis was placed on}} the evaluation of shallow injection of slurry compared with conventional surface spreading. An <b>agronomic</b> <b>assessment</b> quantified the effects of time and method of slurry application to grass (G) and grass/white clover (GC) swards on herbage yield and the efficiency of utilization of slurry N. Cattle slurry was either injected (I) or surface-spread (S) in October (O), March (M) or June (J). The use of a nitrification inhibitor (DCD) was evaluated. Herbage yield, N offtake, apparent N recovery (ANR) and apparent N efficiency (ANE) were improved by the addition of slurry N, with the effects being greater following application in M than in O or J, on G rather than GC and on S rather than I. The inclusion of DCD in the October application improved herbage yield and N offtake, ANR and ANE, with the effects being greater on I than on S. A field-based experiment was carried out to measure the grazing behaviour of cattle grazing swards which had or had not been injected with slurry. Cattle spent more time grazing and less time ruminating, and biting rate was reduced on slurry-treated rather than untreated controls. An indoor test was used to evaluate the effects of injected and surface-spread slurry on ingestive behaviour and diet selection of cattle. The effects of time elapsed since slurry application and simulated rainfall after surface spreading were determined. Cattle selected clean rather than slurry-contaminated herbage and were more averse to herbage treated with surface-spread rather than injected slurry. Aversion to contaminated swards appeared to persist unchanged until at least 21 days post application The addition of water following surface application increased the time spent eating and the number of bites taken. Results show that shallow injection of slurry may allow grazed grassland to be considered for spreading, without detriment to herbage intake. Thus, the increase in land available for spreading would allow lower rates of application and reduce pollution risk. The Institute of Grassland and Environmental Researc...|$|E

Phosphorus buffering capacities control {{the supply of}} P in the soil solution and were measured across Irish soils with contrasting parent material and chemical properties. Langmuir sorption buffer capacities (MBCs) and binding energies (b) were strongly correlated with soil pH and extractable aluminium (Al). A broken-line regression fitted {{to the relationship between}} MBC and Al derived a change-point value for Al above which MBC increased linearly. Soils above the change point were predominantly acidic to neutral with non-calcareous parent material, with larger buffering capacities and binding energies than calcareous soils. Ratios of Mehlich 3 -Al and P (Al:P) were used to relate buffering capacity to supply potential in non-calcareous soils. Large ratios of Al:P were associated with poor P availability, characteristic of strongly P-fixing soils. Threshold values of iron-oxide paper strip P (FeO-P) and Morgan's P revealed Al:P ratios where soils began to supply P in available form. The change-point for Morgan's P fell within the current target index for P availability; however, the confidence interval was more compatible with previous agronomic P indices used in Ireland. Relationships between Morgan's P and measures of extractable P, M 3 -P and Olsen P, deviated in calcareous soils at large soil P contents, indicative of P precipitation processes dominating in these soils.

In this study, we focused on quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and general combining ability (GCA) of Ye 478, a widely used foundation parent in China. We developed three sets of populations for QTL mapping and to analyze the GCA for some <b>agronomic</b> traits. The <b>assessment</b> of 15 traits resulted in the detection of 251 QTLs in six tested environments, with 119 QTLs identified through a joint analysis across all environments. Further analyses revealed that most favorable alleles for plant type-related traits were from Ye 478, and more than half of the favorable alleles for yield-related traits were from R 08, another foundation parent used in southwestern China, suggesting that different types of foundation parents carried different favorable alleles. We observed that the GCA for most traits (e. g., plant height and 100 -kernel weight) was maintained in the inbred lines descended from the foundation parents. Additionally, the continuous improvement in the GCA of the descendants of the foundation parents was consistent with the main trend in maize breeding programs. We identified three significant genomic regions that were highly conserved in three Ye 478 descendants, including the stable QTL for plant height. The GCA for the traits in the F 7 generation revealed that the QTLs for the given traits per se were affected by additive effects in the same way in different populations...|$|R

Various morphological, biochemical and molecular de scriptors have been used to study the diversity of the “Guiana” group.

40|$|This article proposes {{the use of}} a new model, DIAR (Diagnostic Agronomique du Ruissellement, or <b>Agronomic</b> <b>Assessment</b> of Runoff), for the {{prediction}} of the timing of the risk of runoff. DIAR is dedicated to loamy soils which are very sensitive to surface crusting, leading to runoff, soil erosion and muddy flows. The approach is proposed for the north-western European loess belt regions where muddy flows severely impact human activities. The likelihood of runoff is assessed from the sequence of soil surface states generated by cultivation practices. DIAR is based on the calculation of curve number values, for each stage of the soil-surface-state sequence, for calculating runoff for each of these stages. In this study, DIAR is applied to a catchment of 912 ha, cultivated by 26 farmers in the Pays de Caux (Normandy, France) where infrastructures located at the outlet have been damaged several times by muddy flows. Local public authorities involved in reducing muddy flows are eager to limit the agricultural upstream runoff by extending the planting of mustard as a winter cover crop. We tested the efficiency of such a policy on the reduction of the mean runoff. We also tested the year-to-year variability of this efficiency using the acreages of four successive years (1999 – 2000 to 2002 – 2003). Finally, the cost-efficiency of the policy was also considered. Though we used the same weather scenario, the initial situation (without much mustard cover) showed a wide year-to-year variation in the total runoff. This variation can be associated with the structure of the farms that cultivate the catchment (Utilised Agricultural Area (UAA) of each farm and percentage of this UAA inside the catchment). Our results showed that the widespread planting of winter cover crops could reduce the runoff by 10 – 20 % compared with the initial situation (depending on the year), and also reduce the year-to-year variability of runoff. For each of the 4 tested years, the cost of the infiltrated m 3, due to each ha of mustard cover, decreases with the increase in mustard cover. It indicates that the present siting of the mustard cover is not as efficient as it could be. We should ask why farmers do not sow it elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of the soil resource of any region has two parts, namely, an inventory {{of the kinds of}} soil and their distribution, and knowledge of the way each kind can be used and its performance under a range of circumstances. Soil varies substantially and intricately over short distances {{in most parts of the}} world. Inventory by field survey and air-photo interpretation must be done at a local scale. Inventories may be combined so that an individual nation state or region of similar size can know what kinds of soil it has, how much and where they are, how much each can produce, how to manage each in perpetuity, and the risks of degradation in use. Local classifications, with classes defined simply and identifiably on aerial photographs, will serve for mapping, and in combination with classical statistics can provide sound estimates from stratified sampling and <b>agronomic</b> experimentation. Sound <b>assessment</b> should also be at this local scale initially. This should combine fundamental understanding of the soil's behaviour, strategic agronomic research on regional stations, and on-farm trials. The last are crucial for estimating productivity of the soil in practice. Data from all sources can be stored, sorted and displayed by geographic information systems that now have abundant capacity. They should be indexed by soil class and other attributes, with clear distinction being made between assessments of productive potential and basic data. They should be publicly accessible, to ensure that data are readily available and never lost. Estimates of the soil resource and its productivity for large regions, nation states, and the world can be compiled from local surveys by sampling through a 'bottom-up' procedure. <br...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSolar {{radiation}} {{at ground}} level is a necessary input for several applications as potential solar energy <b>assessment,</b> <b>agronomic</b> or meteorological related studies. Images from meteorological geostationnary satellite, once properly processed, can provide solar radiation maps. Several solar atlases with a wide geographical coverage have been built by this process. These maps are more accurate than those made from interpolations of ground measurements. Nevertheless, their spatial resolution - about 10 km over mid-latitude in the best cases - are not sufficient for taking into account spatial variability of the irradiation due to the orographic effects in a local scale. Among these atlases, HelioClim is a GIS providing daily irradiation maps over Europe, Africa and Atlantic Ocean from 1985 up to now. It was developed from a processing on Meteosat images needing a digital terrain model (DTM) as input. HelioClim use the TerrainBase DTM, its spatial resolution is about 1 km. Irradiation maps produced by HelioClim have a spatial resolution of 10 km in our latitudes. In our work, we integrate a digital terrain model (DTM) of very high resolution (10 m) covering the Ouneine valley (Morocco) with HelioClim outputs into a GIS and we derive solar radiation maps. Spatial resolution of these maps {{is the same as}} the DTM. We built 12 maps of monthly mean of daily global irradiation for each month of a year. These monthly means have been computed from daily irradiation between 1997 and 2002. We made comparisons between these maps and ground measurements. We found a relative root mean square error (RMSE) of 7. 5 % for July and 5 % for January. HelioClim using TerrainBase presents for monthly mean of daily irradiation a relative RMSE of 10 % for January and 13 % for July. Integration of HelioClim and a high resolution DTM into a GIS permits to produce accurate solar irradiation maps. Spatial variability of terrain elevation is better taken into account. Such GIS are convenient tools for mapping solar irradiation in mountainous area...|$|R
