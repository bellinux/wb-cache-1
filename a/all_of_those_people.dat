The pageant began with Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issuing an apology to Williams, telling her that although [...] "none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, I want to apologize {{to you and to}} your mother, Miss Helen Williams.

So do many other people—the community of scientists that are pursuing better treatments, through {{a better understanding}} of the basic mechanisms, or by developing better animal models of CRPS, or by undertaking clinical investigations and clinical trials, stretches across many countries and many scientific and clinical disciplines. With <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> supposedlyclever <b>people</b> working on it, one might expect that by now there would be better ways to prevent and treat this debilitating disorder. For many people with CRPS, and for many clinicians trying their darndest to help them, the situation can feel a bit hopeless.

40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{concerned}} with ways for improving the capacity of school communities to provide queer young people with stimulating educational experiences that productively engage {{with the realities of}} their lives and which promote and enhance their wellbeing. By "queer" or "LBGTI" I mean to refer to <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> young <b>people</b> who do not conform to prevailing expectations regarding gender and sexual identity and behaviours, <b>those</b> young <b>people</b> who may be lesbian,gay, bisexual, transgender or intersexual (lGBTI), as well as <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> young <b>people</b> who have an association with gender and sexual diversity (for example, the straight fey boy who gets called a poofta; the teenage girl with lesbian parents, etc.). Methodologically, this chapter draws on a tradition of Foucauldian cultural analysis which acknowledges that gender and sexual identities are not stable or fixed, but that they are generated by influential discourses (e. g. my identity as a "man" in Melbourne today is mediated by contemporary discourses of masculinity, of Australianness, of class and so on) (for example, see Foucault 1984, 1990, 1992 and 1998). This chapter argues that conventional approaches to school improvement for queer students normally focus on strategies for reducing the victimisation of teenage homosexuals, and that such strategies rely on dominant discourses of safety and bullying. I examine a recent example of this policy approach {{and use it as a}} starting point for considering the benefits and the constraints of a victim-based approach to queer youth wellbeing policy. The chapter then moves into a discussion about the recent introduction of human rights legislation in Victoria and how this can assist a move in policy and practice towards a more positive and diffuse engagement with gender and sexual diversity. <br /...|$|R
