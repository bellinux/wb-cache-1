Whatever they relate to in an external way will never make them happy or give them meaning. Art, science, dogma and ethics constantly change.

She considered the changing conception of the world since the 1960s and emphasised {{the need for}} us to consider the consequences of today's environmental concerns for the generations of the future. Short also introduced the subject of Transition Towns, speaking about the first of such towns in Totnes, Devon, UK. These towns aim to create a [...] "community" [...] for the future which [...] "addresses the twin challenges of diminishing oil and gas supplies and climate change, and creates the kind of community that we would <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of." [...] Short was particularly excited about the prospect of a Transition Town movement in Birmingham where her constituency is located.|$|E

2500|$|The {{physical}} {{aspects of}} Lena and Bianca's romance were heavily downplayed by the series. When {{asked if she}} thought she and Riegel had succeeded in living up to the [...] "couple's groundbreaking and progressive" [...] reputation, Sosnovska responded, [...] "Yes, we succeeded to a certain extent. We succeeded in making this couple acceptable." [...] After a pause, Sosnovska continued, [...] "Not acceptable in a realistic sense, since our relationship hasn’t been portrayed truly realistically, {{which would have been}} nice." [...] She described Bianca and Lena's physical relationship as [...] "kind of ostentatiously reserved" [...] compared to what gets shown between heterosexual couples, [...] "although I’m quite shocked by what does get shown between the heterosexual couples." [...] Even though the couple had recently started [...] "dating" [...] again, as the writers also scripted a love triangle including Maggie, there was an apparent double-standard regarding intimacy between the same sex lovers; in the entire year of Lena and Bianca's on-again, off-again relationship, the two women had only kissed twice onscreen. The final obstacles given to the couple's onscreen intimacy were Bianca's rape by Michael and pregnancy with his child, which were controversial and seen by viewers as desperate attempts by the network to avoid lesbian love scenes. AfterEllen.com editor Sarah Warn stated that {{it was a way to}} assure Bianca's continued asexuality. Warn added that [...] "the pregnant-lesbian storyline" [...] is a favorite refuge for television writers who both want to avoid dealing with the sexual aspects of lesbian relationships and who want to [...] "normalize" [...] the lesbian characters — [...] "to show viewers that, at their core, lesbians are just like heterosexual women — who of course, <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mothers". In 2004, though Lena and Bianca were allowed to kiss for a third time onscreen, it came at the end of their romance, as Lena went back to Poland to tend to her ailing mother and the couple was later written to have broken up over the phone.|$|E

We don't <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made into first-class anatomists like Owen, still less into first-class practical surgeons, like Sir Henry Thompson. But what we do all want is a competent general knowledge (amongst other things) of anatomy at large, and especially of human anatomy; of physiology at large, and especially of human physiology. We don't <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> analytical chemists: but what we do all want is to know as much about oxygen and carbon as will enable us to understand the commonest phenomena of combustion, of chemical combination, of animal or vegetable life.

The question is what War Eagle's intentions are. He may make a clean sweep down, attacking all the outlying farms and waiting till he is joined by a lot more of the red reptiles before attacking the settlements. Then, on the other hand, he may think himself strong enough to strike a blow at Gloucester and some other border villages at once. In that case he might leave the outlying farms alone, as the news of the burning of these would reach the settlements and put 'em on their guard, and he knows, in course, that if he succeeds there he can eat you all up at his leisure." ...|$|E
