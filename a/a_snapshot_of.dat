5|$|Because of the {{specialized}} and rare circumstances {{required for a}} biological structure to fossilize, logic dictates that known fossils represent {{only a small percentage}} of all life-forms that ever existed—and that each discovery represents only <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> evolution. The transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, which never demonstrate an exact half-way point between clearly divergent forms.|$|E

5|$|DragonFly BSD {{supports}} Amiga-style resident applications feature: {{it takes}} <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> a large, dynamically linked program's virtual memory space after loading, allowing future instances {{of the program}} to start {{much more quickly than}} it otherwise would have. This replaces the prelinking capability that was being worked on earlier in the project's history, as the resident support is much more efficient. Large programs like those found in KDE Software Compilation with many shared libraries will benefit the most from this support.|$|E

5|$|Wright's {{scientific}} paintings adopted {{elements from}} {{the tradition of}} history painting but lacked the heroic central action typical of that genre. While ground-breaking, they are regarded as peculiar to Wright, whose unique style has been explained in many ways. Wright's provincial status and ties to the Lunar Society, a group of prominent industrialists, scientists and intellectuals who met regularly in Birmingham between 1765 and 1813, have been highlighted, {{as well as his}} close association with and sympathy for the advances made in the burgeoning Industrial Revolution. Other critics have emphasised a desire to capture <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> the society of the day, in the tradition of William Hogarth but with a more neutral stance that lacks the biting satire of Hogarth's work.|$|E

25|$|Cryofixation – {{freezing}} {{a specimen}} so rapidly, in liquid ethane, and maintained at liquid nitrogen or even liquid helium temperatures, {{so that the}} water forms vitreous (non-crystalline) ice.
