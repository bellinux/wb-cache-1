40|$|Purpose of study: Sedimentological {{description}} of outcropping deep-water clastics within Mount Messenger Formation. Study area: North-Taranaki coastal region, North Island, New Zealand. Methodology: Mapping on foot and sedimentary logging. Geological setting: The basin-floor fans and channel levee complexes of Miocene Mount Messenger Formation were deposited in fore-deep, intra (sub) continental Taranaki Basin. The basin is mainly submarine, but Mount Messenger Formation crops {{out in the}} study area with a thickness of approximately 700 m. The lower part is dominated by mid fan deposits, the middle part by lower fan deposits, and the upper part by channel-levee deposits. Lithofacies and lithofacies associations: 4 lithofacies associations have been recognized in the lower and middle part of Mount Messenger Formation; 1) massive sandstone association consist of thick beds of massive very fine to fine grained sandstone interbedded with very thin beds of mudstone interpreted as deposits from gravity-flows with laminar flow component interbedded with hemipelagic mud; 2) heterolithic association consist of interbedded thin beds of very fine to fine grained sandstone and mudstone interpreted as high-density turbidity current or sandy debris-flow deposits interbedded with hemipelagic mud; 3) finely-laminated association consist of thick beds of finely-laminated very fine to fine grained sandstone interpreted as turbidity current deposits; 4) deformed association consist of very thick-bedded, heavily deformed interval interpreted as slump-flow deposits. Architectural elements: 3 types of architectural elements are recognized; 1) massive sandstone association or finely-laminated sandstone association dominated sandstone elements interpreted as mid fan deposits; 2) heterolithic association dominated heterolithic elements interpreted as lower fan deposits; and 3) deformed association dominated deformed elements interpreted as deposits from slope failure. Allostratigraphic units: The architectural elements are stacked in successions of sandstone element ― heterolithic element ― deformed element which each define an <b>allostratigraphic</b> <b>unit</b> bounded by the lower erosive surface of sandstone elements (cycle boundaries). A total of 4 units are recognized. Allostratigraphic architecture: The sandstone elements at the base of each <b>allostratigraphic</b> <b>unit</b> are interpreted to represent different depositional environments within the mid fan setting. The depositional environment changes with time from outer mid fan to middle mid fan to inner mid fan, reflecting the overall progradation of the depositional system into the study area. Paleocurrent measurements indicate the direction of progradation was towards the north-west. Paleogeography: Mount Messenger Formation is interpreted as multiple sourced, moderately efficient, shallow incised, channel attached depositional system. Paleocurrent measurements indicate that <b>Allostratigraphic</b> <b>Unit</b> 1 and 2 were fed from 2 sources; slump-flows from the north and sandy gravity-flows from the south-east. <b>Allostratigraphic</b> <b>Unit</b> 3 and 4 were fed from a source located to the south. The formation can be classified as a hybrid between a sand-rich slope apron and a mixed sand-mud slope apron depositional system in the classification introduced by Reading & Richards (1994). Controls on stratigraphic architecture: 3 stratigraphic time hierarchies are recognized within the studied deposits; 1) onset of Mount Messenger deposition representing a low-frequency hierarchy with several million years or more duration interpreted to result from interacting factors of sediment supply, subsidence and eustasy, but ultimately controlled by the uplift in the south-east; 2) rhythmic stacking of architectural elements representing a medium-frequency hierarchy with 100 - 200 thousand years duration interpreted to result from tectonic processes; and 3) thinning-up successions within architectural elements representing a high-frequency hierarchy with 10 ’s of thousands years duration interpreted to result from autogenic processes. </p...|$|E

The deposits were dated by luminescence and indicate periods of more intense colluvial deposition between 6 and 220 ky B. P. These events correspond approximately to the transitions between the oxygen isotope stages 2 - 3 - 4 and 5 - 6, suggesting that this aggradation was influenced by climatic changes. However, the most important alluviation episode was tentatively correlated with the Middle to Upper Pleniglacial of the Wisconsin glaciation. The most intensive and frequent periods of precipitation that occurred during climate transitions are probably correlated with aggradation events.

When marine sediments are reworked and conglomeratic layers are discontinuous the clast lithological analysis becomes an invaluable tool to deterrnine stratigraphic correlations between outcrops. The clast count in conglomerates deposits, often combined with other types of analysis (e. g. facies analysis, paleocurrent analysis), is a very powerful tool for correlating the conglomeratic layers. Two statistica! analyses of grave] clasts from the Lower Pleistocene deposits in the Lower Cecina Valley (Tuscany, ltaly) have been combined to unravel changes in the palaeo-drainage system. Data from sixteen outcrops were collected and 6400 clasts described.

40|$|The Palaeogene Promina Beds (PB), {{exposed in}} the Dinaric coastal range, {{is about a}} 2 km thick {{heterogeneous}} succession representing a late sedimentary fill of the North Dalmatian foreland basin. The paper  focuses on the middle part of the PB represented by a prominent transgressive unit. The study of this unit is based on field mapping, logging and facies analysis, {{as well as the}} investigation of stratigraphic surfaces and facies successions. The unit extends for more than 63 km, along the entire basin. Deposition began transgressively over both alluvial deposits of the Lower PB and older basin basement. Along its extent the studied unit may be represented either by stacked (high-frequency), marine transgressive-regressive cycles, by lacustrine deposits, mainly limestones, or by a single, marine limestone unit. An ideal transgressive-regressive cycle includes a transgressive segment of limestones, and a regressive segment of storm-wave dominated shelf to gravelly beachface (coarsening-upward) deposits. Gravelly beaches are represented by several types. One of them included the steeply inclined, lower beachface which is situated below the intertidal zone. The cycles are separated by lower-rank discontinuity surfaces (flooding surfaces), while their two segments are separated by a lower-rank transgressive-regressive turnaround surface. Lacustrine deposits originated due to a rise in groundwater induced by a sea-level rise basinwards. The deposition of a single limestone unit resulted from a transgressive onlap over uplifted, Eocene and Cretaceous carbonates of the basin basement. The end of the transgression is marked by condensation processes indicated by glauconite, skeletal debris, planktonic foraminifera and hardgrounds, and a major transgressive-regressive turnaround. The subsequent evolution is almost uniform along the entire extent of the studied unit, and includes shelf to delta and shelf to beach cycles of the highstand.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an allostratigraphic and facies {{interpretation of the}} modern coarse clastic Flat Island barrier complex, situated on the tectonically-structured southern margin of St. George's Bay, western Newfoundland, Canada. The study {{is based on an}} integrated geological, geophysical and oceanographic dataset, including aerial photography, multibeam sonar bathymetry data, shallow reflection seismic data, seabed samples, seabed video, wave and current measurements, cores, and pit and outcrop observations. [...] The Flat Island barrier complex evolved under the influence of a cyclic relative sea level regime associated with post-glacial eustatic sea level rise and superimposed isostatic uplift. The stratal architecture of the barrier complex reflects the interrelationships of eustatic rise, isostatic uplift, basin physiography, and local sediment supply variations. The barrier complex comprises a four-part stratigraphic succession (Units A - D) delineated by key bounding discontinuities (BD 1 - BD 5). [...] The lower-most marine <b>allostratigraphic</b> <b>unit</b> (A) consists of aggradational, fine-grained glaciomarine sediments deposited during late-glacial ice recession, which was accompanied by marine onlap of isostatically depressed terrain. Unit A is bounded below and above by "initial" and "maximum" transgressive surfaces, respectively (bounding discontinuities BD 1 and BD 2). [...] Maximum coastal onlap (~ 13. 5 kyBP) was followed by forced regression, as isostatic uplift ensued and exceeded the rate of ongoing eustatic sea level rise. Forced regression {{led to the development of}} a subaerial unconformity (BD 3) as fluvial channel systems sought progressively lower base levels, locally incising the maximum transgressive surface (BD 2). [...] Isolated delta bodies (Unit B), graded to (present-day) elevations of approximately + 26 m to - 25 m, are interpreted as accretionary forced regression deposits. Delta growth occurred during periods of slow forced regression (possibly related to eustatic pulses), accompanied by high rates of glacio-fluvial sediment supply. The subaerial unconformity (BD 3) truncates and incises the top of Unit B delta deposits, which downlap the marine maximum transgressive surface (BD 2). [...] A "lowstand-stillstand" occurred as the rate of isostatic rebound diminished and became equal to the rate of eustatic sea level rise (~ 9. 5 kyBP). The subaerial unconformity (and correlative conformity) at lowest base level are overlain by aggraded fluvial channel fill and delta front deposits (Unit C). Unit C displays stratigraphically climbing delta front clinoforms, consistent with normal regression during stable to rising relative sea level. The Unit C deposits are interpreted to mark the turnover from relative sea level "fall" to relative "rise". The top of Unit C defines a maximum regressive surface (BD 4). [...] A regional transgressive surface (BD 5) developed as Holocene eustatic sea level rise became dominant, and is characterized by widespread shoreline and wave base ravinement, with erosion of up to 20 m of vertical section. Below present sea level, preserved elements of the subaerial unconformity (BD 3) are restricted to deeply incised channel systems. [...] High rates of littoral sediment supply combined with favourable basin margin physiography promoted the formation and seaward progradation of the modem barrier - shoreface complex (Unit D) during regional relative sea level rise. Shoreface progradation beyond the (pre-existing) slope margin results in ongoing, episodic retrogressive slumping and turbidity flows. Hydrodynamic monitoring and modeling indicate that sediment transport on the barrier shoreface is storm-driven, and dominated by high magnitude, low frequency events occurring at quasi-decadal time scales. [...] Conglomeratic barrier deposits overlying the sandy shoreface sediments consist of discordant sets of aggradational to progradational beach ridges with intervening tidal swales, and local washovers. The barrier fronts an estuarine embayment that is being progressively infilled by overwash and bayhead delta sediments. Flat Island barrier is responding to ongoing regional transgression through processes of episodic shoreline erosion, lateral accretion, washover, and in-place drowning. [...] This thesis research was motivated by the challenges faced by academic and industry researchers when attempting to interpret the genetic origins and depositional environments of ancient marginal marine coarse clastics. The study provides valuable insights regarding coarse clastic facies architecture, depositional processes, and relative sea level relationships...|$|E

Three terraces and correlative unconformities, often with paleosols developed in fining-upward, cross-bedded gravelly sand, are the contacts for informal Deweyville <b>allostratigraphic</b> <b>units.</b> Deweyville unit terraces exhibit large meander scars and have steeper gradient profiles than the modern floodplain. Thermoluminescence (TL) and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dates constrain deposition of the High (HD), Middle (MD), and Low (LD) Deweyville units to OIS 3 through early OIS 2 (53 to 27 ka). ^ The river subsequently eroded and buried the LD unit, depositing three informally-defined Post-Deweyville <b>allostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> (PD 1, PD 2, and PD 3). Paleosols mark the contacts between units that consist of rare channel facies and predominantly fine-grained sediments in thin, horizontal beds that thicken near the modern bayline. Channels in PD units exhibit small meanders and floodplain gradients become less steep with age. OSL dates constrain PD units to OIS 2 and OIS 1 (24 ka to present). ^ The episodic sea-level fall during OIS 3 controlled the elevation to which the river graded, but had limited upstream impact. Deweyville meander dimensions, clast sizes, and terrace gradient profiles out of phase with sea level indicate climatic influences on river behavior. OIS 3 climates were cool, with pervasive mid-latitude cyclonic storms that increased effective moisture, changed the vegetative cover, and produced thick soils. The aforementioned environmental factors produced bankfull-stage floods which caused lateral accretion, concentrated coarse sediments in large point bars, and allowed discharge-driven incision and terrace formation. ^ A glacio-eustatic rise flooded the lower valley and causing a progressive decrease in floodplain gradients during deposition of the PD units. The warming climate of the interglacial transition favored cloudbursts and infrequent tropical storms, decreased effective moisture, and resulted in vegetation changes, soil erosion, and increased suspended sediment loads. Overbank-floods deposited, fine-grained vertically accreted alluvium, ultimately contributing to smaller meanders and less channel migration. When combined with base-level influences, flood regime changes caused aggradation and channel avulsion in downstream reaches of the stream. ...|$|R

The findings reveal a series of intrazonal events (some unreported until now in the Mediterranean Neogene basin), including the particularly interesting two influxes of the Globorotalia miotumida group during the Tortonian.

In deep basins of the Marmara Sea, the lower part of Allounit A, designated Subunit A 2, is a laminated sapropel, M 1. On the shelf, Subunit A 2 consists of backstepping delta lobes and early-transgressive barrier islands and sand sheets. Allounit B has only been recovered in Marmara Sea cores collected at water depths greater than V 90 m, and represents basinal or prodeltaic deposition during the 23 ^ 12 -ka late Pleistocene lowstand.

Within the deltaic sequence the transgressive and highstand system tracts were recognized. The unit 2 is composed by several alluvial fan systems deposited in small incised valleys developed within the previously, uplifted deltaic deposits and successively incised by a braided river system. In-situ produced cosmogenic nuclides were used in order to date the age of the deposition of the deltaic deposits. Results suggest that the studied deltaic sediments belonging to the unit 1 were deposited between 1, 300, 000 and 200, 000 year ago thus during the Lower to Middle Pleistocene, whereas the unit 2 was deposited during the Middle Pleistocene as a consequence of a tectonically driven uplift phase. Furthermore samples collected within the prograding part of the delta show the higher denudation rates. The obtained results demonstrate that burial ages and related erosion rates inferred from cosmogenic nuclides concentrations can be considered as a very useful tool to reconstruct the sea level changes over the past 1 million year...|$|R
40|$|Field mapping, stratigraphic and sedimentologic investigations, and {{a series}} of {{radiocarbon}} and optically-stimulated luminescence dates (OSL) define a record of Late Pleistocene and Holocene landscape change along 100 km of the Loire and Arroux Rivers in southern Burgundy, France. Seven informally designated <b>allostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> have been differentiated (T 8 -T 2), each representative of time periods when rivers were adjusted to prevailing hydrological regimes. ^ Glacial/periglacial episodes resulted in braided stream systems and aggradation of cross-bedded channel facies with intra-stratal cryogenic structures ca OIS 6, 80 – 40 ka, and 22 – 11 ka. Meandering rivers developed during interglacial episodes (maritime climates), resulting in sediment removal from valley axes and/or the deposition of single-story, bimodal channel/overbank facies, without intra-stratal cryogenic structures. The transition from braided to meandering streams is recorded as a shift in facies from erosionally bounded, trough cross-stratified sand and gravel to diffuse gravel sheets, between 11 ka and 7. 3 ka. Rapid meandering and lateral reworking of older deposits between 6. 4 ka and 3 ka resulted in thin sandy overbank deposition and organic sedimentation in abandoned channels, during a moist maritime climate. Channel width-depth ratios decreased and vertical accretion of silt and fine sand dominated the floodplain setting ca 2 – 1. 2 ka, resulting from a shift to an increasingly Mediterranean style climate. An undulating scour and fill topography and a wide, straightened channel developed during the Little Ice Age under the influence of meridional circulation and frequent, large floods. Following the Little Ice Age, an increasingly zonal circulation resulted in dry conditions punctuated by large, infrequent floods and the deposition of coarse facies in overbank floodplain settings. Regional similarities in the timing of depositional episodes across France, and strong relationships between discharge regimes and atmospheric circulation over the last 115 years, support the hypothesis that climatic change is the dominant extrinsic control on the development of these fluvial successions. ...|$|R
40|$|The post-evaporitic Messinian in the {{northern}} sector of the Adriatic foredeep {{is characterized by the}} occurrence of abundant terrigenous deposits which have been subdivided into two <b>allostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> (p-ev(1), p-ev(2)) separated by an erosional unconformity of regional importance. The p-ev(1) consists of basal complex of resedimented evaporites overlain by monotonous succession of mudstone/siltstone alternations (thin bedded turbidites) with an overall coarsening and shallowing upwards trend. It is possibly related to the rapid basin infill {{after the end of the}} salinity crisis. The upper unit (p-ev(2)) shows, in the most marginal areas, a clear cyclical stacking pattern made up of three fining-up sequences with fan-delta conglomerates at the base of each cycle. Here, a peculiar feature of the p-evz deposits is the occurrence of three distinct laminated limestone horizons (termed colombacci) interbedded with fine grained, varved mudstones. These limestones are abiotic, despite the occurrence of abundant Ostracod assemblages (Lago-Mare fauna) in the interbedding pelites, and are interpreted as inorganically precipitated, deposited in a relatively deep-water environment, possibly anoxic and related to permanent stratification of water mass events during periods of lake level maxima. The combination of petrographical and geochemical observations on carbonate layers reveals that they correspond to events characterized by significant variations of environmental conditions. However, delta(18) O (- 5. 30 /+ 0. 2) and delta(13) C (- 9. 28 / + 1. 68) signatures suggest that the precipitation of low-Mg calcite often occurred in a non-marine environment and that meteoric water input had a considerable influence on late Messinian sedimentation. Moreover, the limestones have a uniform Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 composition (0. 70864 - 0. 70875) in the range of other Lago-Mare sediments from elsewhere in the Mediterranean, suggesting that some of the major Mediterranean basins were likely interconnected during the Lago-Mare phase. A strongly reduced rate of hydrological exchange with the ocean is also possible, but the possibility of marine influence during this stage is not completely excluded. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Surficial {{geologic}} studies {{near the}} Area 3 Radioactive Waste Management Site (RWMS) were conducted {{as part of}} a site characterization program. Studies included evaluation of the potential for future volcanism and Area 3 fault activity that could impact waste disposal operations at the Area 3 RWMS. Future volcanic activity could lead to disruption of the Area 3 RWMS. Local and regional studies of volcanic risk indicate that major changes in regional volcanic activity within the next 1, 000 years are not likely. Mapped basalts of Paiute Ridge, Nye Canyon, and nearby Scarp Canyon are Miocene in age. There is a lack of evidence for post-Miocene volcanism in the subsurface of Yucca Flat, and the hazard of basaltic volcanism at the Area 3 RWMS, within the 1, 000 -year regulatory period, is very low and not a forseeable future event. Studies included a literature review and data analysis to evaluate unclassified published and unpublished information regarding the Area 3 and East Branch Area 3 faults mapped in Area 3 and southern Area 7. Two trenches were excavated along the Area 3 fault to search for evidence of near-surface movement prior to nuclear testing. <b>Allostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> and fractures were mapped in Trenches ST 02 and ST 03. The Area 3 fault is a plane of weakness that has undergone strain resulting from stress imposed by natural events and underground nuclear testing. No major vertical displacement on the Area 3 fault since the Early Holocene, and probably since the Middle Pleistocene, can be demonstrated. The lack of major displacement within this time frame and minimal vertical extent of minor fractures suggest that waste disposal operations at the Area 3 RWMS will not be impacted substantially by the Area 3 fault, within the regulatory compliance period. A geomorphic surface map of Yucca Flat utilizes the recent geomorphology and soil characterization work done in adjacent northern Frenchman Flat. The approach taken was to adopt the map unit boundaries (line work) of Swadley and Hoover (1990) and re-label these with map unit designations like those in northern Frenchman Flat (Huckins-Gang et al, 1995 a,b,c; Snyder et al, 1995 a,b,c,d) ...|$|R
40|$|The Bajo Segura Basin is a {{marginal}} basin of the Western Mediterranean {{located on the}} eastern end of the Betic Cordillera (southeastern Spain). Its Messinian and Pliocene stratigraphic record is divided into four <b>allostratigraphic</b> <b>units,</b> with bounding unconformities represented by erosional surfaces corresponding to palaeogeographic changes. The Messinian Unit I (MI) is composed of three depositional systems (fluvial, coastal lagoon, and shelf) which lateral facies changes, deposited in a context of sea level highstand. The upper boundary of the MI Unit corresponds to the intra-Messinian unconformity, a lowstand erosional surface with palaeovalleys of 30 m deep generated by a sea level fall. Messinian Unit II (MII) comprises five correlative depositional systems (from fluvial to coastal) deposited during a new sea level highstand after a reflooding that followed the preceding lowstand. The upper boundary of Unit MII corresponds to the end-Messinian unconformity, which is another lowstand erosional surface with similar palaeovalleys to those of the intra-Messinian unconformity. Messinian Unit MIII forms the fluvial fill of some small incised palaeovalleys, developed during the end-Messinian lowstand. Over the end- Messinian unconformity lies the Pliocene Unit (P), which consists of four depositional systems superimposed in continuity. The first two (littoral and open marine) form a transgressive assemblage that fill the palaeovalley carved over the end-Messinian unconformity. The latter two (shallow marine to coastal in the lower part, and fluvial in the upper part) form a regressive prograding assemblage deposited in a highstand context, when the sea level reached its height in the early Pliocene. In relation to the Messinian salinity crisis, we propose that Unit MII is correlative to the evaporites deposited in the centre of the Bajo Segura Basin (San Miguel Gypsum Formation), corresponding to the marginal evaporites of the Mediterranean. Evaporitic sedimentation in the Mediterranean abyssal plain, which is represented in the margins by erosional surfaces, may correspond to either of the two unconformities (intra-Messinian and end-Messinian) recognized in the Bajo Segura Basin.

40|$|In {{the area}} {{comprised}} between {{the villages of}} Riparbella and Casale Marittimo (lower Cecina Valley, Tuscany, Italy) {{a large amount of}} Pleistocene deposits outcrops. Through a detailed geological survey integrated with facies analysis five litostratigraphic units, grouped in three <b>Allostratigraphic</b> <b>Units</b> (UA), have been detected. The oldest (UA 7), lower pleistocenic in age, is formed by two litostratigraphic units (“Conglomerati delle Ginepraie” and “Sabbie ed argille ad Arctica islandica”) showing latero-vertical relationships and are organized in a transgressive-regressive cycle. The “Conglomerati delle Ginepraie” are arranged in a fining upwards trend and were deposited in small coalescent deltaic environments. Three depositional facies are recognized within the “Sabbie ed argille ad Arctica islandica” recording a fining-coarsening and deepening shallowing upward trend. The UA 7 lies in unconformity above pre-quaternary deposits. The second (UA 6), lower pleistocenic in age, is also constituted by two heteropic and transgressive litostratigraphic units (“Conglomerati delle Lame” and “Arenarie e Sabbie di Montescudaio”) lying in angular unconformity on the UA 7. The “Conglomerati delle Lame”, showing a well developed imbrication, were deposited in a foreshore to upper shoreface depositional environment. The “Arenarie e Sabbie di Montescudaio” are characterized by a high to low planar-cross stratification and sometimes by overturned stratification and were deposited in a shallow marine environment. The regressive phase of this UA is not preserved due to erosive processes. The youngest unit (UA 4, “Conglomerati di Serra all’Olio”), was instead deposited in fluvial-braided environment and lies in angular unconformity on the others UA. The middle pleistocenic age of this unit has been inferred {{on the basis of its}} stratigraphic position. This stratigraphic reconstruction strongly conflict from previous interpretations. Important climatic and geological remarks derive from the finding of two taxa (Arctica islandica and the coral Cladocora caespitosa) at different stratigraphic positions within the oldest unit (“Sabbie ed argille ad Arctica islandica”). The Arctica islandica testifying cold temperatures (4 °C to 13 °C) characterizes the first 5 meters of the unit, while beds of Cladocora caespitosa (15 °C to 22 °C the temperature range of this coral) only occur upwards. We retain that the deposition of the “Sabbie ed argille ad Arctica islandica” takes place during a warming phase and that the development of Cladocora caespitosa beds could be related to the maximum flooding conditions at the end of the transgressive phase. This interpretation leads to some notable chronostratigraphic implications...|$|R
