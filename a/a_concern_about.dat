5|$|One of Madgwick's primary {{responsibilities}} as chairman was {{to answer questions}} and inquiries from the Commonwealth government and its committees. In 1968 the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts investigated the ABC's finances. In late 1971, the Estimates Committee investigated <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> ABC employees sometimes refusing to disclose internal ABC information to government overseers. In August 1971 the Senate Standing Committees on Education, Science and the Arts conducted a general inquiry into radio and television. On every occasion, Madgwick, accompanied by ABC general manager Talbot Duckmanton, travelled to Canberra to answer each committee's questions. Under Madgwick, the ABC's annual budget grew from $50 million in 1969 to $90 million in 1973.|$|E

25|$|A {{large and}} still {{growing number of}} {{attempts}} to create aggregate measures of various aspects of sustainability created a stable of indices that provide a more nuanced perspective on development than economic aggregates such as GDP.

Parallel to these initiatives, political interest in producing a green GDP that would take at least the cost of pollution and natural capital depletion into account has grown, even if implementation is held back by the reluctance of policymakers and statistical services arising mostly from <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> conceptual and technical challenges.|$|E
25|$|The main {{environmental}} concern with tidal energy {{is associated with}} blade strike and entanglement of marine organisms as high speed water {{increases the risk of}} organisms being pushed near or through these devices. As with all offshore renewable energies, there is also <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> how the creation of EMF and acoustic outputs may affect marine organisms. It should be noted that because these devices are in the water, the acoustic output can be greater than those created with offshore wind energy. Depending on the frequency and amplitude of sound generated by the tidal energy devices, this acoustic output can have varying effects on marine mammals (particularly those who echolocate to communicate and navigate in the marine environment, such as dolphins and whales). Tidal energy removal can also cause {{environmental concern}}s such as degrading farfield water quality and disrupting sediment processes. Depending {{on the size of the}} project, these effects can range from small traces of sediment building up near the tidal device to severely affecting nearshore ecosystems and processes.|$|E

500|$|In {{the final}} chapter on the {{application}} of the interest-based rights approach, Cochrane analyses the use of animals in cultural practices, considering the importance of culture, religion and <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> hypocrisy. Cochrane first looks at the possibility that humans have an interest in culture which outweighs certain interests of animals. He argues that it cannot be the case that culture can always outweigh other rights. He then argues the human interest culture cannot outweigh animal interests in not suffering, using jallikattu as his example, or outweigh animal interests in not being killed, even if this entails the destruction of cultures [...] "defined entirely by the grave harm [...] to animals". The human interest in freedom of religion, Cochrane claims, will usually not require the violation of animal interests, but cites Santeria as a possible exception to this. Cochrane argues against the possibility that freedom of religion is a special interest and should always merit priority, and the idea that equal opportunity should entail religious freedom to harm animals. Finally, Cochrane considers hypocrisy; given that animals are harmed in many practices, there may be a problem in disallowing certain religious practices. However, this does not make the religious practices more permissible, and seems to presuppose that these other practices will not themselves face censure.|$|E
