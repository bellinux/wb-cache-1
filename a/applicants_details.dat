[...] If the loan is approved and successfully funded, first-time borrowers are charged roughly $12 (1000 Kenyan Shillings) to cover this cost of processing their application. Upon joining Zidisha, borrowers also make a deposit into a reserve fund {{that is used to}} compensate lenders in the event of default. These costs are only paid once and entitle the borrower to raise an unlimited number of consecutive loans through Zidisha. Zidisha used to contract with local partners to perform telephone-based verifications of each new borrower, but around 2012 the organization discontinued this practice due to fraud, corruption and ineffectiveness.|$|R

The Endangered Species Act (ESA), and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) established moratoria on “taking ” marine mammals and threatened or endangered species. Both statutes provide some exemptions and exceptions to these moratoria. Scientific research permits under the MMPA and recovery permits under the ESA {{are two of the}} most commonly used exemptions. The MMPA and ESA specify a limited range of circumstances under which the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Permits Division, Office of Protected Resources (F/PR 1) may decide to grant an exemption through issuance of a permit. F/PR 1 has promulgated regulations to implement these provisions of the MMPA and ESA. A summary of these and other applicable statutes and regulations are included as Attachment A. An applicant requesting an exemption to a take moratorium must demonstrate that permit issuance would not be detrimental to protected species (i. e., will not disadvantage, jeopardize, or otherwise adversely affect a protected species).

40|$|SUMMARY: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is {{revising}} 18 C. F. R. Part 33 {{to update}} the filing requirements for applications under Part 33, including public utility mergers. The Commission expects that, by providing <b>applicants</b> more <b>detailed</b> guidance for preparing applications, the revised filing requirements will assist the Commission in determining whether applications under section 203 of the Federal Power Act {{are consistent with the}} public interest and will provide more certainty and expedition in the Commission's handling of such applications. This final Rule generally follows the- 2 -approach of the NOPR. This Rule affirms the Commission's screening approach to mergers that may raise horizontal competitive concerns and sets forth specific filing requirements consistent with the Appendix A analysis set forth in the Merger Policy Statement. This Rule also establishes guidelines for vertical competitive analysis and accompanying filing requirements for mergers that may raise vertical market power concerns. The Rule streamlines filing requirements and reduces the information burden for mergers and other dispositions of jurisdictional facilities that raise no competitive concerns and eliminates certain filing requirements in Part 33 that are outdated or no longer useful to the Commission in analyzing mergers and other dispositions of jurisdictional facilities...|$|R

First, feasibility study was carried out and identified the functional requirement and the non functional requirements for the existing system. At this stage, persons were interviewed, documents were reviewed and processes were studied in details manner. Use case diagrams and activity diagrams were drawn for existing system and problems and weaknesses were identified. Then, functional and non functional were decided and organized so that customer requirements are satisfied for the proposed system. The aim and objective of this project were set so that problems and weaknesses eliminated. After coming to agreement with client, use case diagrams and activity diagrams were drawn and use case descriptions were listed in black and white. With the help of use case diagram and activity diagram, sequence diagrams were drawn and class diagram is drawn taking input as sequence diagrams.

40|$|Comparison of South Africa 's Automotive Investment Scheme {{to similar}} trade, export and {{investment}} financial assistance (incentives) regimes of Nigeria and Kenya The AIS is a South African government investment incentive offered within South Africa's Automotive Production and Development Program. The {{intention of the}} AIS is to grow and develop the automotive sector through investment {{in the production of}} new and/or replacement models and components. The overall aim of the research is to analyse whether {{the manner in which the}} AIS incentives seek to achieve the above objectives, and the objectives themselves are aligned and furthermore to indicate the potential weakness of the AIS. The analysis of the weaknesses focuses in particular on potential inconsistencies amongst the provisions of the AIS or amongst the provisions of the AIS and the provisions of its sub - components. Furthermore, the research will review whether the economic benefit criteria of the AIS to be fulfilled by <b>applicants</b> are sufficiently <b>detailed</b> or the lack of details creates uncertainty with the interpretation and implementation. Lastly, the paper will review the transparency elements of the AIS. To obtain an answer to this question, the AIS will be analysed and will be compared against the policies and/or legislation of Nigeria and Kenya, where applicable, to determine whether the policies of these two countries could inform the AIS in achieving its objectives. The analysis will be executed in six chapters. The first chapter is an introduction. Chapter two will cover the policy reasons for the introduction of automotive (and manufacturing related) policies in South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya. Chapter three will provide an overview of the policies and, where applicable, the relevant legislation in the three countries that deal with the automotive industries. As the policies of the three countries are very differently construed, the intention of this paper is not to undertake a full and comprehensive overview of all the relevant South African legislation dealing with tax, customs duties or investment protection to investors in the automotive sector because such legislation is currently one of the key pillars of the Nigerian and Kenyan policies. Therefore, the focus will be on comparing the structure, objectives and operation of the policies of Nigeria and Kenya where it is comparable with the AIS or the APDP. The fourth chapter will deal with the investment specific incentives and benefits provided in the three countries, in particular in relation to cash grants and t heir availability (or not) for investors in Nigeria and Kenya. In relation to Nigeria and Kenya the legislation and policies having similar objectives or structure will be discussed. For South Africa the achievements of the AIS will also be analysed briefly to understand how it has performed against its objectives up until 2015. Chapter five will discuss the institutions and government agencies which are authorized and responsible for handling funding applications, for negotiating funding/investment agreements, and approving and monitoring investment projects related to the automotive industry. The final chapter shall conclude on the findings, and highlight the potential weaknesses of the AIS by providing proposals for improvement based on the lessons learnt from Kenya and/or Nigeria, where or if possible...|$|R
