5|$|About {{seven minutes}} after {{stepping}} onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick.

5|$|Taylor learns {{the whales}} have been {{released}} early, and goes to Kirk for assistance. Taylor, Kirk, and McCoy rescue Chekov <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> now recharged Bird of Prey. After transporting the whales aboard the ship, the crew returns with Taylor to their own time. On approaching Earth, the ship loses power and comes down in San Francisco Bay. Once released, the whales respond to the probe's signal, causing the object to reverse its effects on Earth <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> depths of space. All charges against the Enterprise crew are dropped, save one for insubordination: for disobeying a superior officer, Kirk is demoted from Admiral back {{to the rank of}} Captain where he is returned to command of a starship. The crew departs on their ship, the newly christened USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A), and leaves on a new mission.|$|E

5|$|Adults {{make their}} homes within holes in various {{mangrove}} trees and maintain an arboreal existence whereas the young are strictly terrestrial {{for the first}} year of their lives. As the Utila iguana cannot successfully lay its eggs in the mangrove swamps, the gravid females are forced to migrate to nearby sandy beaches in order to bury their clutches of eggs so they can incubate in the hot sun. After digging their nest burrows and laying their eggs, the females abandon the nests <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mangroves. Sixty to seventy-four days later the hatchlings emerge and move back to the swamps.|$|E

5|$|After a tour in Vienna, Austria and Russian {{language}} {{training at the}} U.S. Army Russian Institute in Oberammergau, Matlock arrived in Moscow {{for the first time}} in 1961. Initially a Vice Consul, Matlock met with individuals seeking to visit or emigrate to the United States. His most famous case was Lee Harvey Oswald, who applied for a repatriation loan to return to the United States after having previously moved to the Soviet Union. Indeed, according to the records received by the Warren Commission, in May 1962, Jack Matlock conducted the exit interview which enabled the Oswald family to leave the USSR <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> USA.|$|E
5|$|After hatching, {{the larvae}} spend another 72 hours absorb their yolk sacs and {{developing}} their fins {{before they become}} free-swimming fry. The fry forage during daylight in a dense school <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cave or crevice for the night. Like other cichlids, the parents retrieve their young just before dark, sucking up three or four {{at a time and}} delivering them into the nest. The parents anticipate night, using a sense of time; in laboratory experiments convict cichlids continued to retrieve young as night approached {{even in the absence of}} any signal, such as dimming light. During the night, the fry bunch up at the bottom of the cave or nest, where the parents fan them.|$|E
5|$|As this {{scenario}} continues, by 100 million {{years from the}} present the continental spreading will have reached its maximum extent and the continents will then begin to coalesce. In 250 million years, North America will collide with Africa while South America will wrap around {{the southern tip of}} Africa. The result will be the formation of a new supercontinent (sometimes called Pangaea Ultima), with the Pacific Ocean stretching across half the planet. The continent of Antarctica will reverse direction <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> South Pole, building up a new ice cap.|$|E

5|$|As with {{previous}} Sonic games, Sonic 3 uses rings, {{scattered throughout the}} levels, as a health system; when the player is attacked without rings, is crushed, falls off-screen, drowns, or exceeds the act's ten-minute limit, they lose a life <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> most recently passed checkpoint. Dying with zero lives gives the player a game over. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an extra life, temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings, a shield {{that allows them to}} breathe underwater, a shield that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby rings.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{formation}} of the United States Numbered Highways, the U.S. relied on an informal network of roads, organized by various competing interests, collectively called the auto trail system. The surveyors of most trails chose either South Pass in Wyoming or a southern route through New Mexico to traverse the Rocky Mountains. Both options were less formidable than the higher mountain passes in Colorado, but left the state without a transcontinental artery. When the planners of the Lincoln Highway also decided to cross the Rockies in Wyoming, officials pressed for a loop to branch from the main route in Nebraska, enter Colorado, <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main route in Wyoming. While the Lincoln Highway was briefly routed this way, the loop proved impractical and was soon removed.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} a significant decline in ratings and plans {{were made to}} take the series into a 'back to basics' approach where storylines would become less controversial <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> focus on relationships and family dynamics. It {{was at this point}} that the character of Declan was created and actress Jane Hall would play his on-screen mother Rebecca Napier. The characters were to create a family unit for then, already existing character Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin).|$|E

5|$|In many decapods, {{the first}} (and {{sometimes}} the second) pair of pleopods are specialised {{in the male}} for sperm transfer. Many terrestrial crustaceans (such as the Christmas Island red crab) mate seasonally <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea to release the eggs. Others, such as woodlice, lay their eggs on land, albeit in damp conditions. In most decapods, the females retain the eggs until they hatch into free-swimming larvae.|$|E
5|$|Over 70 {{percent of}} the Kootenay's {{watershed}} is in Canada while the Montana and Idaho portions occupy 23 and 6%, respectively.

5|$|Some correctional facilities, like San Quentin State Prison, require {{visitors}} to either cut their bras {{and remove the}} underwire, or temporarily use a soft cup bra provided by the institution before being granted entry.
