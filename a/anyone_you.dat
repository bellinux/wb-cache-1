She's the heart of the show and she quite often questions the gender politics." [...] Christopher Borrelli of The Toledo Blade wrote, [...] "Has there ever been a female TV character as complex, intelligent, and, ahem, as emotionally well-drawn as Lisa Simpson? Meet her once and she comes off priggish and one-note– a know-it-all. Get to know her and Lisa is as well-rounded as <b>anyone</b> <b>you</b> may ever meet in the real world." ...|$|E

Love was no longer limited to one person, you could love <b>anyone</b> <b>you</b> chose. In fact love was something you shared with everyone, not just your sex partners. Love exists to be shared freely. We also discovered the more you share, the more you get! So why reserve your love for a select few? This profound truth {{was one of the}} great hippie revelations." [...] Sexual experimentation alongside psychedelics also occurred, due to the perception of their being uninhibitors. Others explored the spiritual aspects of sex.|$|E
2500|$|Under the Arabian pre-Islamic law, no {{limitations}} {{were set}} on men's rights to marry or {{to obtain a}} divorce. Islamic law, however, restricted polygamy (...) The institution of marriage, characterized by unquestioned male superiority in the pre-Islamic law of status, was redefined and changed into {{one in which the}} woman was somewhat of an interested partner. 'For example, the dowry, previously regarded as a bride-price paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property' Under Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a [...] "status" [...] but rather as a [...] "contract". The essential elements of the marriage contract were now an offer by the man, an acceptance by the woman, and the performance of such conditions as the payment of dowry. The woman's consent was imperative. Furthermore, the offer and acceptance had {{to be made in the}} presence of at least two witnesses. A married woman also had rights over the husband as stated by Muhammad that [...] "You have your rights upon your wives and they have their rights upon you. Your right is that they shall not allow <b>anyone</b> <b>you</b> dislike, to trample your bed and do not permit those whom you dislike to enter your home. Their right is that you should treat them well in the matter of food and clothing." ...|$|E
