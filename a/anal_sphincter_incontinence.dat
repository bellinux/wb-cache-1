40|$|AbstractIntroductionObstetric <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> injury has {{important}} psychosocial implications and impact on subsequent pregnancies. Sound operative repair is essential, yet between 14 and 61 % patients with obstetric <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> injuries report <b>incontinence</b> symptoms. Objective {{assessment of the}} outcome following repair can be performed using anorectal manometry and endoanal ultrasonography. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess functional and physiological outcome in patients undergoing operative repair of third or fourth degree tears. MethodsDemographic information and obstetric details were collected retrospectively for patients who sustained a third or fourth degree <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> injury between the periods of 1 st January 2008 – 31 st December 2009. All patients were followed up by the Colorectal Nurse Specialist in a dedicated clinic. A detailed history, examination, anorectal manometry (AM) and endoanal ultrasound (EAU) were performed. ResultsOf 210 patients identified data was available for 190 (90 %). Median age was 29 years and 74 % of the patients were primagravida. Twenty one (11 %) patients had grade 3 tear, 81 (43 %) grade 3 a, 63 (33 %) grade 3 b, 15 (8 %) grade 3 c and 10 (5 %) patients had grade 4 tears. All patients underwent primary repair: where data was available for operative technique 68 (36 %) patients underwent end-to-end and 96 (51 %) had overlap repair. 177 (93 %) of the repairs were performed by Registrars. Median follow up was 3 months and data was available for 142 (75 %) patients. 29 (20 %) patients exhibited symptoms of incontinence. Anal resting and squeeze pressure were reduced in patients experiencing incontinence symptoms (66  mHg vs 58  mmHg and 120  mmHg vs 98  mmHg respectively). EAU revealed one EAS (external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter)</b> /IAS (internal AS) defect, seven IAS defects and 33 thinning of IAS. One quarter of patients with IAS thinning or defect exhibited incontinence symptoms. ConclusionOne fifth of patients experienced some incontinence following repair of obstetric <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> injury, but only 2 patients were incontinent of faeces at 3 month follow up. This represents some improvement in outcome compared to results from the last two decades. Anal pressures in patients experiencing incontinence were reduced, and thinning of the IAS was more common in patients with incontinence symptoms.

We provide {{proof of concept}} that bioengineered mouse IAS rings are neovascularized upon implantation into mice of the same strain and maintain concentric smooth muscle alignment, phenotype, and IAS functionality. Rings were bioengineered by using smooth muscle cells from the IAS of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. Bioengineered mouse IAS rings were implanted subcutaneously on the dorsum of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice along with a microosmotic pump delivering fibroblast growth factor- 2. The mice remained healthy {{during the period of}} implantation, showing no external signs of rejection. Mice were killed 28 days postsurgery and implanted IAS rings were harvested. IAS rings showed muscle attachment, neovascularization, healthy color, and no external signs of infection or inflammation. Assessment of force generation on harvested IAS rings showed the following: 1) spontaneous basal tone was generated in the absence of external stimulation; 2) basal tone was relaxed by vasoactive intestinal peptide, nitric oxide donor, and nifedipine; 3) acetylcholine and phorbol dibutyrate elicited rapid-rising, dose-dependent, sustained contractions repeatedly over 30 min without signs of muscle fatigue; and 4) magnitudes of potassium chloride-induced contractions were 100 % of peak maximal agonist-induced contractions. Our preliminary results confirm the proof of concept that bioengineered rings are neovascularized upon implantation. Harvested rings maintain smooth muscle alignment and phenotype. Our physiological studies confirm that implanted rings maintain 1) overall IAS physiology and develop basal tone, 2) integrity of membrane ionic characteristics, and 3) integrity of membrane associated intracellular signaling transduction pathways for contraction and relaxation by responding to cholinergic, nitrergic, and VIP-ergic stimulation.

40|$|PURPOSE: Using endoanal {{magnetic}} resonance imaging, atrophy {{of the external}} <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> can be established. This aspect has not been thoroughly investigated using three-dimensional anal endosonography. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare prospectively three-dimensional anal endosonography to {{magnetic resonance}} imaging in the detection of atrophy and defects of the external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> in patients with fecal incontinence. In addition, we compared both techniques for <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> thickness and length measurements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with fecal incontinence underwent three-dimensional anal endosonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Images of both endoluminal techniques were evaluated for atrophy and defects of the external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter.</b> External <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> atrophy scoring with three-dimensional anal endosonography depended on the distinction of the external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> and its reflectivity. External <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> atrophy scoring with magnetic resonance imaging depended on the amount of muscle and the presence of fat replacement. Atrophy score was defined as none, moderate, and severe. A defect was defined at anal endosonography by a hypoechogenic zone and at magnetic resonance imaging as a discontinuity of the sphincteric ring and/or scar tissue. Differences between three-dimensional anal endosonography and magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> atrophy and defects were calculated. In addition, we compared external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> thickness and length measurements in three-dimensional anal endosonography and magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included (median age, 58 years; range, 27 - 80; 15 women). Three-dimensional anal endosonography and magnetic resonance imaging did not significantly differ for the detection of external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> atrophy (P = 0. 25) and defects (P = 0. 38). Three-dimensional anal endosonography demonstrated atrophy in 16 patients, magnetic resonance imaging detected atrophy in 13 patients. Three-dimensional anal endosonography agreed with magnetic resonance imaging in 15 of 18 patients for the detection of external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> atrophy. Using the grading system, 8 of the 18 patients scored the same grade. Three-dimensional anal endosonography detected seven external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> defects and magnetic resonance imaging detected ten. Three-dimensional anal endosonography and magnetic resonance imaging agreed on the detection of external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> defects in 13 of 18 patients. Comparison between three-dimensional anal endosonography and magnetic resonance imaging for sphincter thickness and length measurements showed no statistically significant concordance and had no correlation with external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> atrophy. CONCLUSION: This is the first study that shows that three-dimensional anal endosonography can be used for detecting external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> atrophy.

Research on mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) -based therapies has shown promising results. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate functional recovery after treatment with MSCs in two animal models of <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> injury. Methods. Seventy virgin female rats received a sphincterotomy (SP) to model episiotomy, a pudendal nerve crush (PNC) to model the nerve injuries of childbirth, a sham SP, or a sham PNC. <b>Anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> pressures and electromyography (EMG) were recorded after injury but before treatment and 10 days after injury. Twenty-four hours after injury, each animal received either 0. 2 ml saline or 2 million MSCs labelled with green fluorescing protein (GFP) suspended in 0. 2 ml saline, either intravenously (IV) into the tail vein or intramuscularly (IM) into the <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter.</b> Results.

The {{purposes of this}} study were to compare external phased-array MRI to endoanal MRI for depicting external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> atrophy in patients with fecal incontinence and to evaluate observer reproducibility in detecting external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> atrophy with these techniques. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with fecal incontinence (23 women, seven men; mean age, 58. 7 years; age range, 37 - 78 years) underwent both endoanal and external phased-array MRI. Images were evaluated for external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> atrophy by three radiologists. Measures of differences and agreement between both MRI techniques and of interobserver and intraobserver agreement of both techniques were calculated. RESULTS: The MRI techniques did not significantly differ in their ability to depict external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> atrophy (p = 0. 63) with good agreement (kappa = 0. 72). Interobserver agreement was moderate (kappa = 0. 53 - 0. 56) for endoanal MRI and moderate to good (kappa = 0. 55 - 0. 8) for external phased-array MRI.

METHODS: Three hundred and thirty adults presenting for evaluation of fecal incontinence were recruited. Ultrasound was performed with a 7. 5 -MHz radial rotating axial endoprobe in the left lateral position. <b>Anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> muscle tears were graded {{on the basis of the}} degree of circumferential involvement (25 percent) and by an assessment of the superoinferior longitudinal extent of an external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> tear. Muscles that demonstrated multiple tears, poor visualization, or fragmentation were classed as fragmented. Sphincter injuries were correlated with basal and squeeze pressures at manometry, pudendal nerve terminal latencies, and the severity of symptoms using the Parks-Browning clinical score. RESULTS: Patients with an intact external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> had a higher squeeze pressure (mean, 162. 6 cm H 2 O) than those with a partial- (mean, 125. 7 cm H 2 O) or full-length tear (mean, 124. 9 cm H 2 O; P 25 percent. Basal pressure was significantly lower in those with a full-length external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> tear (47. 8 cm H 2 O) vs. an intact external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> (65. 7 cm H 2 O; P < 0. 001). The basal pressure in those with an intact internal <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> was not significantly different from those with clearly defined internal <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> tears, and the degree of circumferential involvement was also not important in this regard. However, those with a fragmented internal <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> had a significantly lower basal pressure than other subgroups of internal <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> injuries (P < 0. 001). There was no association between external or internal <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> status and the mean pudendal nerve terminal motor latency, suggesting the patient groups were neurologically similar. There was no significant association between external or internal <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> status and the severity of reported symptoms.

40|$|PURPOSE: External <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> atrophy at endoanal {{magnetic}} resonance imaging {{has been associated with}} poor outcome of <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> repair. We studied the relationship between external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> atrophy on endoanal {{magnetic resonance}} imaging and clinical, functional, and anatomic characteristics in patients with fecal incontinence. METHODS: In 200 patients (mean Vaizey score, 18 (+/- 2. 9 standard deviation)) magnetic resonance images were evaluated for external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> atrophy (none, mild, or severe) by radiologists blinded to anorectal functional test results and details from medical history. Subgroups of patients with and without atrophy were compared for medical history, anal manometry, pudendal nerve latency testing, anal sensitivity testing, external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> thickness, and external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> defects. Whenever significant differences were detected, we tested for differences between patients with mild and severe atrophy. RESULTS: External <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> atrophy was demonstrated in 123 patients (62 percent) : graded as mild in 79 (40 percent), and severe in 44 patients (22 percent). Patients with atrophy were more often female (P < 0. 001) and older (P = 0. 003). They had a lower maximal squeeze (P = 0. 01) and squeeze increment pressure (P < 0. 001).

The overall prevalence of third- or four-degree <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> injury was 6. 6 % (partial <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> injury 4. 6 %, total <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> injury 1. 2 %, unclassified as either partial and total 0. 2 %, or fourth degree lacerations 0. 6 %). The risk for a partial, total, or a fourth-degree <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> injury decreased with increasing maternal BMI most pronounced for total <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> injury where the risk among morbidly obese women was half that of normal weight women, OR 0. 47 95 % CI 0. 28 – 0. 78.

40|$|Perineal endometriosis is {{a disease}} {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} endometrial tissue in the perineal region. Perineal endometriosis with <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> involvement is an infrequent oc-currence. In many cases it is confused with granuloma, abscess, lipoma, adenopathy. The best treatment to obtain satisfactory cure consists in the wide excision, but it may cause <b>incontinence</b> if the <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> is involved. Conversely, narrow excision may result in incomplete removal, with increased recurrence rates and need of additional hormonal therapy. In this paper we describe a 45 year old patient, with diagnosis of perianal endometrioma with <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> involvement. The patient went through surgery with wide excision and preserved <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter.</b> After one year follow-up there were not complications reported by fecal incontinence. In contrast, the perineal endometriosis is considered an infrequent occurrence of pelvic endometriosis...|$|R

40|$|Atrophy of the {{external}} <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> can be shown only on endoanal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Until now no study has compared the morphological endoanal MRI findings with histopathological aspects of {{the external}} <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to validate the MRI interpretation {{of the external}} <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> using histology as a "gold standard. " In this prospective study 25 consecutive unselected women (median age 48 years, range 27 - 72) with fecal incontinence due to obstetric trauma were assessed preoperatively with endoanal MRI. All patients underwent anterior sphincteroplasty within 6 months of the preoperative assessment. During sphincter repair, a biopsy specimen was taken both from the left and right lateral parts of the external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter.</b> Interpretation of MRI was performed by one of the radiologists (J. S.), and biopsy specimens were evaluated by the pathologist (W. J. M.). Both were blinded to the interpretation of the other. MRI revealed external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> atrophy in 9 of the 25 patients (36 %). Histopathological investigation confirmed these findings in all but one. In one additional patient atrophy was detected on histological investigation while the morphology of the external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> was classified as normal on MRI. In detecting sphincter atrophy endoanal MRI showed 89 % sensitivity, 94 % specificity, 89 % positive predictive value, and 94 % negative predictive value. MRI correctly identified sphincter morphology in 23 of 25 cases (92 %). This study demonstrates that endoanal MRI accurately identifies normal and abnormal external <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> morphology. Endoanal MRI is therefore a valuable preoperative diagnostic too...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Topical nitrates lower <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> {{pressure}} and heal anal fissures, but {{a majority of}} patients experience headache. The internal <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> has a calcium dependent mechanism to maintain tone, and also receives an inhibitory extrinsic cholinergic innervation. It may therefore be possible to lower <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> pressure using calcium channel blockers and cholinergic agonists without side effects.  AIMS—To investigate the effect of oral and topical calcium channel blockade and a topical cholinomimetic on <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> pressure.  METHODS—Three studies were conducted, each involving 10  healthy volunteers. In the first study subjects were given oral 60  mg diltiazem or placebo on separate occasions. They were then given diltiazem once or twice daily for four days. In {{the second and third}} studies diltiazem and bethanechol gels of increasing concentration were applied topically to lower anal pressure.  RESULTS—A single dose of 60  mg diltiazem lowered the maximum resting <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> pressure (MRP) by a mean of 21 %. Once daily diltiazem produced a clinically insignificant effect but a twice daily regimen reduced anal pressure by a mean of 17 %. Diltiazem and bethanechol gel produced a dose dependent reduction of the anal pressure; 2 % diltiazem produced a maximal 28 % reduction, and 0. 1 % bethanechol a maximal 24 % reduction, the effect lasting three to five hours.  CONCLUSIONS—Topical diltiazem and bethanechol substantially reduce <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> pressure for a prolonged period, and represent potential low side effect alternatives to topical nitrates for the treatment of anal fissures.    Keywords: diltiazem; bethanechol; <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> pressure; <b>anal</b> fissure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> defects {{have been}} shown to {{increase}} pressure asymmetry within the anal canal in patients with fecal incontinence. However, this correlation is far from perfect, and other factors may play a role. The goal {{of this study was to}} assess the impact of rectal prolapse on anal pressure asymmetry in patients with anal incontinence. Methods 44 patients, (42 women, mean age: 64 (11) years), complaining of anal incontinence, underwent anal vector manometry, endo-anal ultrasonography (to assess sphincter defects) and pelvic viscerogram (for the diagnosis of rectal prolapse). Resting and squeeze anal pressures, and anal asymmetry index at rest and during voluntary squeeze were determined by vector manometry. Results Ultrasonography identified 19 <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> defects; there were 9 cases of overt rectal prolapse, and 14 other cases revealed by pelvic viscerogram (recto-anal intussuception). Patients with rectal prolapse had a significantly higher <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> asymmetry index at rest, whether patients with <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> defects were included in the analysis or not (30 (3) % versus 20 (2) %, p Conclusions In anal incontinent patients, anal asymmetry index may be increased in case of <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> defect and/or rectal prolapse. In the absence of <b>anal</b> <b>sphincter</b> defect at ultrasonogaphy, an increased anal asymmetry index at rest may point to the presence of a rectal prolapse. </p...|$|R
