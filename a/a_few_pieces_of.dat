5|$|In August 2001, an {{expedition}} {{headed by the}} marine archaeologist and author Clive Cussler announced that they had found {{the remains of a}} ship embedded in the Rochelois reef. Only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> timber and some metal artifacts could be salvaged, the remainder of the wreckage being lost within the coral. Initial tests on the wood indicated that it was the type extensively used in New York shipyards at the time of Mary Celestes 1872 refit, and it seemed the remains of the Mary Celeste had been found. However, dendrochronological tests carried out by Scott St George of the Geological Survey of Canada showed that the wood came from trees, most probably from the US state of Georgia, that would still have been growing in 1894, about ten years after the Mary Celestes demise.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} {{of the very few}} chairs which have come down from a remote antiquity is the reputed Chair of Saint Peter in St Peter's Basilica at Rome. The wooden {{portions}} are much decayed, but it would appear to be Byzantine work of the 6th century, and to be really an ancient sedia gestatoria. It has ivory carvings representing the labours of Hercules. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> an earlier oaken chair have been let in; the existing one, Gregorovius says, is of acacia wood. The legend that this was the curile chair of the senator Pudens is necessarily apocryphal. It is not, as is popularly supposed, enclosed in Gian Lorenzo Bernini's bronze chair, but is kept under triple lock and exhibited only once in a century. Byzantium, like Greece and Rome, affected the curule form of chair, and in addition to lions’ heads and winged figures of Victory (or Nike) and dolphin-shaped arms used also the lyre-back which has been made familiar by the pseudo-classical revival {{of the end of the}} 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse are monogamous. The {{breeding}} season usually coincides with {{a crop of}} seeds after the local rainy season and at this time, the feeding flocks tend to break up into pairs. The nesting site is a slight depression in the ground, sometimes lined with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> dry foliage. Most typically, three cryptic eggs are laid, though occasionally there may be two or four. Incubation duties are shared and in most species, the males incubate at night while the females sit on the eggs during the day. The eggs usually hatch after 20–25 days. The precocial chicks are covered with down and leave the nest {{as soon as the}} last hatchling has dried out. The parents do not provide them with food and they learn, with parental guidance, what is edible and what is not. The chicks obtain their water from the soaked downy feathers on the adults breasts. At first the chicks are too small and young to thermoregulate, and are provided with shade during the hottest part of the day and brooded at night. They remain with their parents, as a family group, for several months.|$|E

25|$|An {{inventory}} of White House furnishings taken on May 26, 1865, showed that {{nearly the entire}} buff band china service had survived. It appeared to be inferior or roughly handled, however, {{and much of it}} broke over the next two years. An inventory dated February 28, 1867, indicated that only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> this set remained.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Ranabir Singh Thapa, {{brother of}} Bhimsen Thapa, {{was to be}} the Sector Commander of Makawanpur-Hariharpur axis. He was given a very large {{fortress}} and about 4,000 troops with old rifles and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> cannons. But the British could not move forward from the border. Colonel Ranabir Singh Thapa had been trying to lure the enemies to his selected killing area. But Major General Wood would not venture forward from Bara Gadhi and he eventually fell back to Betiya.|$|E

25|$|In 1996 {{the team}} of Robert V. Fletcher and Terry L. Cameron (under the {{supervision}} of the Ohio Historical Society's Bradley T. Lepper) reopened a trench created by Frederic Ward Putnam of Harvard over 100 years before. They found <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> charcoal in what was believed to be an undisturbed portion of the Serpent Mound. However, bioturbation, including burrowing animals, frost cracks, etc., can reverse the structural timeline of an earthen mound such as Serpent Mound. It can shift carbon left by a later culture on the surface to areas deep within the structure, making the earthwork appear younger.|$|E
25|$|Taishi Ci {{was famous}} for his archery skills. There was one notable {{incident}} when he accompanied Sun Ce to attack rebels in Mabao (麻保). The rebel leader stood at the viewing platform above the gate, with his hand resting against a wooden pillar, and hurled verbal abuse at Sun Ce. Taishi Ci took aim and fired an arrow at him. The arrow pierced through both the pillar and the rebel's hand. Everyone was awed by Taishi Ci's skill. When the warlord Cao Cao heard about Taishi Ci, {{he wrote a letter}} to him and put it inside a box containing <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> danggui.|$|E
25|$|From 1630 Ronsard was {{not again}} reprinted {{for more than}} two centuries. Just before the close of the second, however, Sainte-Beuve printed a {{selection}} of his poems to accompany the above-mentioned Tableau (1828). There are also selections, Choix de poésies - publiées par A. Noël (in the Collection Didot) and Becq de Fouquières. In 1857 Prosper Blanchemain, who had previously published a volume of Œuvres inédites de Ronsard, undertook a complete edition for the Bibliothèque Elzévirienne, in eight volumes. It is practically complete; <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> a somewhat free character which are ascribed with some certainty to the poet are, however, excluded. A later and better edition still is that of Marty-Laveaux (1887–1893), and another that of Benjamin Pifteau (1891).|$|E

25|$|The Romans built a stone-walled fort in AD150 {{to protect}} the river {{crossing}} which was {{at the foot of}} the Tyne Gorge, and this took the name of the bridge so that the whole settlement was known as 'Pons Aelius'. The fort was situated on a rocky outcrop overlooking the new bridge, on the site of the present Castle Keep. Pons Aelius is last mentioned in AD400, in a Roman document listing all of the Roman military outposts. It is likely that nestling in the shadow of the fort would be a small vicus, or village. Unfortunately, no buildings have been detected; only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> flagging. It is believed that there was a Roman cemetery near Clavering Place, behind the Central station, as a number of Roman coffins have been unearthed there.|$|E
25|$|Apparently the {{earliest}} of the Rollright Stones, the Whispering Knights are {{the remains of}} the burial chamber of an Early or Middle Neolithic portal dolmen lying 400metres east of the King's Men. Four standing stones survive, forming a chamber about twosquare metres in area around a fifth recumbent stone, probably the collapsed roof capstone. Although archaeologists and antiquarians had been speculating and debating the nature of the Whispering Knights for centuries, more about the monument was only revealed following the excavations carried out around the stones by George Lambrick and his team during the 1980s. They revealed that the portal dolmen had never been a part of a longer cairn, as had been suggested by some earlier investigators, and uncovered <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> Neolithic pottery around the monument.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene is}} set in a small and messy garret, sparsely {{furnished}} by <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> crude furniture.

500|$|A further {{peculiarity}} of {{the structure}} {{is the lack of}} associated mortuary temple. Instead, the eastern tomb [...] boasts a small offering chapel built of undecorated white limestone and situated within the tomb superstructure. Its ceiling reached [...] high. Excavations revealed small pieces of papyrus inscribed with a list of offerings as well as fragments of an alabaster statue of a woman clothed in a simple robe. The burial chamber revealed scant remains of the female owner and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> funerary equipment.|$|E
500|$|William Etty {{was born}} in 1787, {{the son of a}} York baker and miller. He began as an {{apprentice}} printer in Hull.

Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he submitted paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, all of which were either rejected or received scant attention when exhibited.|$|E
500|$|On 23October 1805 Etty's seven-year {{indenture}} with Peck expired, {{an event}} greeted with great happiness as he intensely disliked the job.
