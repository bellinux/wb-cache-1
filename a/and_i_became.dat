In her diary she wrote, [...] "When my brother... was a young boy learning the Chinese classics, I was in the habit of listening to him <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>became</b> unusually proficient at understanding those passages that he found too difficult to understand and memorize. Father, a most learned man, was always regretting the fact: 'Just my luck,' he would say, 'What a pity she was not born a man! With her brother she studied Chinese literature, and she probably also received instruction in more traditional subjects such as music, calligraphy and Japanese poetry. Murasaki's education was unorthodox. Louis Perez explains in The History of Japan that [...] "Women... were thought to be incapable of real intelligence and therefore were not educated in Chinese." [...] Murasaki was aware that others saw her as [...] "pretentious, awkward, difficult to approach, prickly, too fond of her tales, haughty, prone to versifying, disdainful, cantankerous and scornful".

Jon Bream of the Star Tribune reported: [...] "For most movie soundtracks, producers negotiate with record companies, managers and lawyers for the services of big-name singers.
