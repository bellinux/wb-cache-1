5|$|A key {{stress on}} both {{freshwater}} and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including water pollution, {{the building of}} dams, removal of water for use by humans, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of exotic species.

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Napoleon, {{not only was the}} Napoleonic Code {{retained}} by conquered countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, parts of Italy and Germany, but has been used as the basis of certain parts of law outside Europe including the Dominican Republic, the US state of Louisiana and the Canadian province of Quebec. The memory of Napoleon in Poland is favorable, for his support for independence and opposition to Russia, his legal code, the abolition of serfdom, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of modern middle class bureaucracies.|$|E
5|$|After the {{reconversion}} of Scandinavian Scotland in {{the tenth}} century, Christianity under papal authority was the dominant {{religion of the}} kingdom.

5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behavior. The Lānai hookbill is only known to have eaten {{the fruit of the}} ōpuhe; however, it is unlikely that its unique bill would have developed to eat fruit, and {{it may have been a}} snail specialist. The hookbill has not been seen since 1918, and by 1940 nearly all of Lānai's forests were converted into pineapple fields, destroying the bird’s habitat. The combination of habitat destruction <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of feral cats and rats are thought to have led to the Lānai hookbill’s extinction.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona's Camp Nou is {{the largest}} stadium in Europe. The club's highest home {{attendance}} was 120,000 in a European Cup quarter-final against Juventus on 3 March 1986.

5|$|Discovering {{that many}} of his satraps and {{military}} governors had misbehaved in his absence, Alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to Susa. As a gesture of thanks, he paid off the debts of his soldiers, and announced that he would send over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedon, led by Craterus. His troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of Opis. They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units.|$|E

5|$|In 1791, two representatives on mission {{informed}} the National Convention of the disquieting condition of Vendée, and this news was quickly {{followed by the}} exposure of a royalist plot organized by the Marquis de la Rouerie. It {{was not until the}} social unrest combined with the external pressures from the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of a levy of 300,000 on the whole of France, decreed by the National Convention in February 1793, that the region erupted.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, King's {{opened its}} own {{hospital}} on Portugal Street near Lincoln's Inn Fields, an area composed of overcrowded rookeries characterised by poverty and disease.

The hospital moved to new premises in Denmark Hill, Camberwell in 1913. The appointment in 1877 of Joseph Lister as professor of clinical surgery greatly benefited the medical school, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of Lister's antiseptic surgical methods gained the hospital an international reputation.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, due {{to issues}} {{caused by the}} transmission, the French Army began to {{modernize}} its fleet of tanks to AMX-30B2 standards, which included a new transmission, an improved engine <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of a new fin-stabilized kinetic energy penetrator.

5|$|It was {{not until}} after 1832 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of the Scottish Reform Act 1832 that control of Scottish {{politics}} {{was taken from the}} hands of landowners and a small number of merchants. The Friends of the People Society in the 1790s was opposed by those landed gentry politicians. After the Act came into effect, the constituencies were changed, and this raised the electorate from under 5,000 to 65,000.|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads are {{considered}} {{an endangered species}} and are protected by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Untended fishing gear is responsible for many loggerhead deaths. Turtles may also suffocate if they are trapped in fishing trawls. Turtle excluder devices have been implemented in efforts to reduce mortality by providing an escape route for the turtles. Loss of suitable nesting beaches <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of exotic predators have also taken a toll on loggerhead populations. Efforts to restore their numbers will require international cooperation, since the turtles roam vast areas of ocean and critical nesting beaches are scattered across several countries.|$|E

5|$|Nearly 500 {{years of}} intense contact between {{speakers}} of Nahuatl and speakers of Spanish, {{combined with the}} minority status of Nahuatl and the higher prestige associated with Spanish has caused many changes in modern Nahuatl varieties, {{with large numbers of}} words borrowed from Spanish into Nahuatl, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of new syntactic constructions and grammatical categories.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the {{traditional}} structure {{has had to}} adapt to very influential changes, including divorce <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of single-parent families, teenage pregnancy and unwed mothers, and same-sex marriage, and increased interest in adoption.

5|$|Peada's {{conversion}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> {{of priests}} into Middle Anglia {{could be seen}} as evidence of Penda's tolerance of Christianity, given the absence of evidence that he sought to interfere.
