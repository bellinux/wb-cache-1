40|$|Immanence and {{transcendence}} {{in modern}} philosophy. Some questions {{with reference to}} Fichte's 'Atheismusstreit'. One of the main differences between scholastic and modern thinking {{is the way in}} which the relationship between God and the world, transcendence and immanence is conceived. At the end of the middle ages the analogy of being loses its credibility, and as a result of this transcendence and immanence are radically opposed to each other. One of the clearest examples of this tension in modern philosophy is J. G. Fichte, especially his writings on the 'Atheismusstreit', in which he got involved in 1798 / 99. The aim of this article is to analyse and evaluate Fichte's criticism of traditional theism and his attempt to develop a 'post theistic' philosophy of religion. For Fichte it is evident that God as a supersensible being cannot be thought if one starts from the sensual world; there is an absolute incommensurability between the two. Therefore, not only the traditional proofs of Gods existence lose their validity, but also any conceptual knowledge of God in general becomes impossible. All our knowledge of God is totally equivocal. Traditional predicates of God, like substance and person, turn Him into a finite being. However, Fichte's rejection of traditional theism does not lead him to atheism, but to a post theistic thinking of God. God can only be thought (by an intellecual intuition) if one starts from man as a moral, i. e. supersensible being. Man has an absolute, <b>autonomous</b> <b>duty</b> to act morally, and is by no means dependent on the results of his acting in the sensual world. God, as the moral ordination of the world, is the guarantee that the moral purpose of my will is realized necessarily. Man does not need a God outside of this ordaining activity, and more generally outside of his relation to Him. Consequently, God has no separate existence, nor transcendence, but is a whole of which men as moral actors are parts. In this way the analogy between God and the world is given up for an identity; our speaking of God becomes strictly univocal. The tenability of this post theistic philosophy of religion is evaluated on two points. Firstly, Fichte's denial of God as a separate being raises the problem that He becomes a product of man, and that His transcendence disappeares. God is nothing else than an exteriorisation of the supersensible in man. Secondly, Fichte's univocal speaking of God is criticized. In a famous letter, Jacobi admires Fichte as a philosopher 'out of one piece'. His thinking assimilates everything as a moment of the ego. But on the other hand this really scientific philosophy leads inevitably to nihi lism and atheism. Over against this Jacobi puts forward that the absolute is something before and outside knowing; our belief in God excludes every rational mediation. As a conclusion, it is shown that modern philosophy oscillates between a univocal thinking of God, leaving no room for His transcendence, and an equivocal belief in Him, that excludes every rational mediation: God is either a product of man, or becomes irrelevant for his life and thinking...|$|E
5000|$|The liberal-individualist or {{sometimes}} liberal conception of citizenship suggests that citizens should have entitlements necessary for human dignity. It assumes people act {{for the purpose}} of enlightened self-interest. According to this viewpoint, citizens are sovereign, morally <b>autonomous</b> beings with <b>duties</b> to pay taxes, obey the law, engage in business transactions, and defend the nation if it comes under attack, but are essentially passive politically, and their primary focus is on economic betterment. This idea began to appear around the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and became stronger over time, according to one view. According to this formulation, the state exists for the benefit of citizens and has an obligation to respect and protect the rights of citizens, including civil rights and political rights. It was later that so-called social rights became part of the obligation for the state.|$|R
40|$|In a {{synchronized}} multi {{camera system}} {{it is imperative}} that the synchronization error between the different cameras is as close to zero as possible and the jitter of the presumed frame rate is as small as possible. It is even more important when these systems are used in an autonomous vehicle trying to sense its surroundings. We would never hand over the control to a autonomous vehicle if we couldn't trust the data it is using for moving around. The purpose of this thesis was to build a synchronization setup for a multi camera system using state of the art RayTrix digital cameras that will be used in the iQMatic project involving <b>autonomous</b> heavy <b>duty</b> vehicles. The iQMatic project is a collaboration between several Swedish industrial partners and universities. There was also software development for the multi camera system involved. Different synchronization techniques were implemented and then analysed against the system requirements. The two techniques were hardware trigger i. e. external trigger using a microcontroller, and software trigger using the API from the digital cameras. Experiments were conducted by testing the different trigger modes with the developed multi camera software. The conclusions show that the hardware trigger is preferable in this particular system by showing more stability and better statistics against the system requirements than the software trigger. But the thesis also show that additional experiments are needed for a more accurate analysis. iQMati...|$|R
40|$|With an {{imminent}} future of fully <b>autonomous</b> heavy <b>duty</b> vehicles in offroad applications, {{the need for}} advanced control system will increase accordingly. By implementing a raster map with tiles and pixels, to which a vehicle can record slope and position data while driving, {{it is possible to}} map earth's surface. By adding a heat parameter to every pixel, i. e. the number of passings through it historically, it is possible in future visits of the same are to generate a route prediction made up by the "hottest" pixels. By fetching the slope values in the hottest pixels, it is possible to generate a slope horizon that can be utilized by control systems, e. g. when planning gear shifts in hilly offroad terrain. To mange the incrementally growing map, a memory management system was implemented. It buffers the relevant map data from the database, i. e. the vehicles closest surroundings, which is then used for route prediction and horizon generation. As the vehicle moves into other areas, new data is read from the database, and the recently passed area is written back to the database, however updated from the recent passing. The system is implemented so that it runs through another application in the telematics electrical controller unit (ECU) in a Scania vehicle. The ECU contains a GNSS module from which the vehicle fetches satellite positioning data. Slope data is fetched from a slope sensor mounted on the truck. Due to implications during testing and debugging of the resulting application developed and implemented during this thesis project, the application's performance couldn't be assessed properly. However, it is concluded that the background the application is built on is reliable, although tweaks to get the application fit for usage in offroad terrain had to be made. Mainly, the horizon length and map building techniques should not be the same as in similar applications for onroad driving...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMajor IT {{companies}} and vehicle manufacturers have announced {{their plans for}} autonomous driving technology. <b>Autonomous</b> light <b>duty</b> vehicles are {{often referred to as}} “driverless cars” (DLC). These technologies intend to partly or fully replace driving by combining navigation systems, artificial intelligence, in-vehicle sensors, roadside ITS and traffic monitoring data, vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V 2 I) communications. The absence of perception errors and the minimal perception and reaction time of DLC enable them to maintain shorter headways, to apply consistent acceleration and deceleration rates, and to optimize the use of gaps. In theory, freeway operations and level of service (LOS) can be impacted to a substantial but yet unknown degree by the DLC. The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). is a static and macroscopic methodology for assessing various traffic flow facilities. Its 2010 edition is not adjusted for the presence of DLC on highways, however, several of its parameters are sensitive to differences in perception and reaction times, headways, etc. An investigation was conducted to assess the likely changes to traffic flow characteristics that may result from the introduction of DLC. The focus of this paper is on expressways, that is, on HCM analyses of basic freeway segment and freeway weaving segment. DLC is able to increase capacity (c), the maximum service flow rate (MSFi), the adjustment factor for unfamiliar driver population (fP), passenger-car equivalent (PCE), and the proportion of heavy vehicles (PT). The combined benefits improve LOS. The results from the case studies show that the impacts of DLC on HCM parameters are tiny if the DLC have a very small market share. Two types of DLC are considered in this paper: Autonomous DLC, and Connected DLC with V 2 V and V 2 I. On a basic freeway segment the Autonomous DLC improves LOS from D to C when its share in traffic reaches 7 %. The same case study shows that the Connected DLC improves LOS from D to C when its share in traffic reaches 3 %...|$|R
50|$|In the U.S. a {{teaching}} fellow is an advanced graduate student {{who serves as}} the primary instructor for an undergraduate course. Known as teaching fellows at many universities, such as Harvard University, Boston College and Boston University, they are {{also referred to as}} 'graduate student instructors' (GSIs) at some other universities, such as the University of Michigan and the University of California system. Typically, TFs teach courses in their area of research specialty, in which they hold a master's degree or equivalent. Teaching fellows differ from teaching assistants in that they are responsible for all aspects of the course, including lecture, whereas TAs assist the instructor by performing ancillary course-related tasks such as grading and holding discussion section or laboratory. Many (about two-thirds) of the graduate students who have served as TAs serve as a TF for one or more classes each semester. Although TFs are fairly <b>autonomous</b> in their <b>duties,</b> many universities, such as the University of Pittsburgh, require supervision of TFs by professors experienced in teaching the course content, with whom TFs must hold regular meetings and receive feedback about the quality of their teaching. As a rule, TFs receive a higher stipend than TAs in accordance with the greater responsibility and time commitment of {{a teaching}} fellowship, but like TAs, their contracts are renewed on a semester-by-semester basis, and they cannot be granted tenure.|$|R
5000|$|The liberal-individualist {{conception}} of citizenship, or sometimes merely the liberal conception, has {{a concern that}} the individual's status may be undermined by government. The perspective suggests a language of [...] "needs" [...] and [...] "entitlements" [...] necessary for human dignity {{and is based on}} reason for the pursuit of self-interest or more accurately as enlightened self-interest. The conception suggests a focus on the manufacture of material things as well as man's economic vitality, with society seen as a [...] "market-based association of competitive individuals." [...] From this view, citizens are sovereign, morally <b>autonomous</b> beings with <b>duties</b> to pay taxes, obey the law, engage in business transactions, and defend the nation if it comes under attack, but are essentially passive politically. This {{conception of}} citizenship has sometimes been termed conservative in the sense that passive citizens want to conserve their private interests, and that private {{people have a right to}} be left alone. This formulation of citizenship was expressed somewhat in the philosophy of John Rawls, who believed that every person in a society has an [...] "equal right to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties" [...] and that society has an obligation to try to benefit the [...] "least advantaged members of society". But this sense of citizenship has been criticized; according to one view, it can lead to a [...] "culture of subjects" [...] with a [...] "degeneration of public spirit" [...] since economic man, or homo economicus, is too focused on material pursuits to engage in civic activity to be true citizens.|$|R

Najvažniji njeni činitelji, kako u Istanbulu, tako i u Bosni, bili su darovi, novac i usluge, jer su tako nalagale okolnosti, a njenu vještinu je određivala pravilna procjena osobe i pristupa, odnosno potrebnog troška. Being {{posted in}} the {{vicinity}} of Dubrovnik, the Bosnian beylerbeys and the Herzegovinian sancakbeys were among the most significant East officials that Dubrovnik had to deal with. They represented a powerful state that was very important for Dubrovnik. At the same time, however, they were quite <b>autonomous</b> in their <b>duties,</b> and provided with scarce incomes. Following the practicies in Istanbul and Bosnia alike, Ragusan diplomacy resorted to gifts, money, and services. Among skills of a good diplomate was the ability to find a personal approach, that is, to estimate the expenses to be conceded. Several series in the Dubrovnik State Archives (e. g., the letters and instructions of the Senate to its envoys in Bosnia, the Senate records, Turkish letters, etc.) contain considerable evidence on all the activities to which the Ragusan authorities resorted over the years in order to develop and maintain good relations with these two Turkish administrators in Bosnia. Since the day of their installation, the Ragusans would honor them with ordinary (It. ordinario, solito), habitual gifts (e. g., money, cloths, sugar, candles, spices, and sweets) that were presented to them by Ragusan representatives during ceremonies. On other occasions they received extraordinary (It. estraordinario) gifts, including money. The Ottomans themselves were in constant pursuit of a variety of favors and services (medical care, masons, stone masons, etc.), ordered foodstuffs of all kinds (sweets, fruit, candied fruit, oil, and beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic), luxuries, and useful everyday products (mirrors, compasses, glasses, geographical charts), as well as animals for sport (hunting dogs and falcons). Gifts, money, and services were the most decisive factors in the Ragusan diplomatic contacts with Ottoman officials. Regardless of the expenditures the Dubrovnik treasury was burdened with and the danger and inconvenience the Ragusan envoys were put to, it was generally viewed that the Ragusan diplomacy in Bosnia was successful. This can be proven by the following: the Ragusan trade business survived through the most unfavorable conditions, {{in spite of all the}} bans, obstacles, and burdens; although frequently violated, the Dubrovnik salt monopoly managed to exist, together with the regulation according to which Dubrovnik and Ston were the only permitted marts on the coast between Split and Durrës. With an adequate amount of money and plenty of gifts, the Bosnian high officials protected the Republic from the Venetians and the hostile intentions of the Porte itself...|$|R
