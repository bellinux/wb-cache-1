[...] " [...] am working on a lot of new projects... jewelry, music, art and mixed media [...] paint still flows <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> state is better than it has been for [...] long while". On 26 May, the Cure embarked on a 19-date summer festival tour of Europe, commencing at the Pinkpop Festival, joined by former the Cure/COGASM collaborator Reeves Gabrels on guitar. On the same day, it was announced that Gabrels would be standing in {{for the remainder of the}} tour, but was not a fully-fledged member of the band. Gabrels later revealed that Robert Smith had emailed him at the end of April to ask if he was free over summer, saying that he missed [...] "having a wingman" [...] on guitar.

2500|$|The {{first of}} the three read out was Humphrey's Executor v. United States. After taking office, President Roosevelt {{came to believe that}} William Humphrey, a Republican {{appointed}} to a six-year term on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1931, was at odds with the administration's New Deal initiatives. Writing to request Humphrey's resignation from the FTC in August 1933, Roosevelt openly admitted his reason for seeking his removal: [...] "I did not feel that your mind <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> go along together." [...] This proved to be a blunder on Roosevelt's part. When Humphrey could not be persuaded to resign, Roosevelt dismissed him from office on October 7.|$|E

2500|$|He {{designed}} a contest-winning poster titled [...] "Usefulness • Beauty • Health • Truth • Knowledge" [...] for the Girl Scouts in 1931. This contest {{was conducted by}} the Art Alliance of America, an organization that brought together craft workers and manufacturers. The six-judge panel consisted of W. T. Benda (who replaced Charles Dana Gibson), Ray Greenleaf, Rockwell Kent, John La Gatta, Neysa McMein and Edward A. Wilson. Martin's model for the poster was Barbara Smith, a 14-year-old from Darien, Connecticut (formerly Yonkers, N.Y). Her parents and Martin were longtime friends. He even served as best man at their wedding back in 1904. His winning entree earned him a first-place check, from the Girl Scouts' National Director Josephine Schain (pictured). This exchange took place right after the top three were announced, at their old national headquarters on Lexington Avenue in New York City. National President Mrs. Frederick (Birdsall Otis) Edey {{was one of three}} consultants, along with executives Mrs. Arthur O. (Anne Hyde) Choate and Mrs. Nicholas F. (Genevieve Garvan) Brady. This poster (pictured in insert) later appeared with three raised fingers instead of a salute, on the cover of Girl Scout Equipment catalogs for Fall 1932 and Spring 1933. It captured the spirit of their character-building movement, and was in popular usage until 1937. Martin said at the award ceremony, [...] "Barbara seems [...] the personification of all that Girl Scouting means. She is the very spirit of radiant, happy and wholesome young girlhood, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> naturally turned to her immediately when I learned of the competition." ...|$|E
