In 2008, MIVILUDES President Jean-Michel Roulet said that complaints from the faithful against Kennel for physical abuse were dismissed.|$|E

5|$|The {{accident}} {{became a}} subject of intense news coverage. The origin of the poorly stored radioactive source was traced to KSE, which was charged with possessing radioactive substances without permission and was fined 15,000 baht (approx $450). Environmental Litigation and Advocacy for the Wants (EnLAW), a non-governmental advocacy group, later filed a class action lawsuit against KSE {{on behalf of the}} victims, and also against the OAEP in the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court.</b> The <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court</b> later ruled in 2003 in favour of the plaintiffs, ordering the OAEP to pay 5,222,301 baht (approx $155,000) as restitution.

40|$|The article {{presents}} how {{the jurisdiction of}} <b>administrative</b> <b>courts</b> has been shaped by legislative acts that introduced a system of two-instance <b>administrative</b> <b>courts.</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>courts</b> exercise judicial power just like the Supreme Court, courts of general jurisdiction and courts martial (article 175 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland). The range of administrative courts’ jurisdiction {{and the nature of}} their judicial power are clearly formulated in article 184 of the Constitution. According to the article, <b>administrative</b> <b>courts</b> exercise control over civil service within a scope limited by statutes. The control involves passing judgments on the compliance of local government’s resolutions with statutes. Setting clear limits of administrative courts’ material jurisdiction by the Constitution had a decisive impact on the way and scope of regulating this jurisdiction by statutes that introduced reform of administrative courts: the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Courts</b> Structure Act, 25 th July 2002, the Proceedings Before <b>Administrative</b> <b>Courts</b> Act, 30 th August 2002, and Introductory Provisions to: <b>Administrative</b> <b>Courts</b> Structure Act and the Proceedings Before <b>Administrative</b> <b>Courts</b> Act...|$|R

5|$|Bulgaria has {{a typical}} civil law legal system. The {{judiciary}} is {{overseen by the}} Ministry of Justice. The Supreme <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court</b> and the Supreme Court of Cassation are the highest courts of appeal and oversee the application of laws in subordinate courts. The Supreme Judicial Council manages the system and appoints judges. Bulgaria's judiciary, along with other institutions, remains one of Europe's most corrupt and inefficient.|$|E
5|$|Germany has a {{civil law}} system based on Roman law with some {{references}} to Germanic law. The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review. Germany's supreme court system, called Oberste Gerichtshöfe des Bundes, is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice, and for other affairs the courts are the Federal Labour Court, the Federal Social Court, the Federal Finance Court and the Federal <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{standard}} {{argument against}} specialized <b>administrative</b> <b>courts</b> {{in the tradition}} of civil law jurisdictions is their lack of independence.

In this paper, we use a dataset of 365 medical malpractice cases decided by the Spanish Supreme Court in 2006 - 2010 to test the extent to which <b>administrative</b> <b>courts</b> are biased in favor of the government.

5|$|Many {{courts have}} {{declined}} to assess the religious status of Scientology, finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand. The Federal <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court</b> for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} July 2012, Libor Michálek {{accepted}} the Czech Pirate, Green, and Christian Democrat Party senatorial nominations for District 26. The Pirate Party was his primary affiliation due to its transparency and accountability platforms. His personal 12-point platform prioritized direct democracy, fair political party competition, and anti-corruption oversight efforts alongside social welfare reforms. In the October 2012 elections, he won 24.3 percent {{of the first round}} vote and 74.4 percent of the first-past-the-post runoff, giving him the seat. Another candidate, Karel Berka, challenged the decision, but the Czech Supreme <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court</b> found the claims unfounded. He was the first Pirate Party candidate to be elected to national office, the 81-seat Czech Senate. His senatorial term is 2012–2018.|$|E

5|$|The German Church of Scientology has {{repeatedly}} challenged {{the legality of}} this surveillance in court. In December 2001, the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court</b> in Berlin ruled against the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff {{and members of the}} Church of Scientology Berlin as paid informants. The court ruled that the use of informants was disproportionate. In 2003, the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report, given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution.|$|E
5|$|The issues {{regarding}} {{the development of}} the park's coastline remain open. The Master Plan of Tsarevo Municipality adopted in 2008 and approved by the Ministry of Environment and Water envisages the construction of vacation complexes with 75,000 beds on the territory of the park and Natura 2000 network. As a result, the European Commission launched an infringement procedure against Bulgaria that forced the Ministry to withdraw the positive environmental assessment of the Master Plan in 2010 but the decision was rejected by the Supreme <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court.</b> The Strandzha Nature Park Management Plan drafted in 2003 has not yet meet with approval by the Ministry of Environment and Water.|$|E
5|$|The main {{threat to}} the park comes from the {{uncontrolled}} tourist development which has plagued the Bulgarian Black Sea coast since the early 1990s. So far, {{the coast of the}} Strandzha Nature Park has remained almost intact. The most notable example is the case of the Golden Pearl hotel complex near the village of Varvara, whose construction commenced in 2006 on the territory of the part, supported by Tsarevo Municipality without ecological evaluation. After protests the construction was declared illegal later that year but the mayor of Tsarevo and the investor appealed to the Supreme <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court</b> of Bulgaria. In June 2007 the Court revoked the protected status of Strandzha Nature Park with order № 6794/29.06.2007. After mass protests the National Assembly adopted legislation prohibiting the right to appeal to court orders of the government establishing protected areas. In 2008 the Court declared the Golden Pearl hotel complex illegal and in 2012 the construction site was demolished.|$|E
