5|$|A {{reversible}} surgical method {{under investigation}} is reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) {{which consists of}} injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide, into the vas deferens. An injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility. Another is an intravas device which involves putting a urethane plug into the vas deferens to block it. A combination of an androgen and a progestin seems promising, as do selective <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor</b> modulators. Ultrasound and methods to heat the testicles have undergone preliminary studies.|$|E
5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and spironolactone {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The drug is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor</b> at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. Finasteride is likely an effective treatment for acne.|$|E

50|$|More recently, <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors</b> {{have been}} shown to have a second mode of action. As has been also found for other steroid hormone receptors such as {{estrogen}} <b>receptors,</b> <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors</b> can have actions that are independent of their interactions with DNA. <b>Androgen</b> <b>receptors</b> interact with certain signal transduction proteins in the cytoplasm. Androgen binding to cytoplasmic <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors</b> can cause rapid changes in cell function independent of changes in gene transcription, such as changes in ion transport. Regulation of signal transduction pathways by cytoplasmic <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors</b> can indirectly lead to changes in gene transcription, for example, by leading to phosphorylation of other transcription factors.|$|R

PG - 2405 - 8 AB - The spermatogonial stem cell transplantation technique was employed to determine if murine germ cells require functional <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors</b> to complete qualitatively normal spermatogenesis. Testicular cells from testicular feminized mice were injected into the seminiferous tubules of azoospermic mice expressing functional <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors.</b> Recipient testes were analyzed between 110 and 200 days following transplantation. Multiple colonies of complete and qualitatively normal donor-derived spermatogenesis were seen within the seminiferous tubules of each recipient testis, demonstrating that murine germ cells do not require functional <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors</b> to complete spermatogenesis. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentration}} of dihydrotestosterone {{was measured by}} radioimmunoassay in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from rat ventral prostates. In the regenerating prostates of castrated rats treated with dihydrotestosterone for 4 days, the nuclear {{concentration of}} this steroid increased from approx. 70 nM to 800 nM as a linear function of the injected dose, whereas the cytoplasmic concentration remained relatively constant (70 - 130 nM). Isotope-exchange measurements of nuclear <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors</b> by using [3 H]methyltrienolone indicated that, although the concentration of nuclear dihydrotestosterone was several-fold higher than the concentration of <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors,</b> they were logarithmically related. The recruitment of prostatic cells into the growth fraction and the stimulation of 5 alpha-reductase activity were more directly correlated to the nuclear concentration of <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors</b> than to the total nuclear concentration of dihydrotestosterone. Maximal restoration of a specific isoenzyme of acid phosphatase ws achieved when approx. 2000 <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors</b> {{were present in the}} prostatic nuclei; higher concentrations of nuclear <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors</b> were associated with decreased amounts of this enzyme. Hence the results imply, first, that the total amount of dihydrotestosterone accumulated by nuclei is not a direct consequence of carrier-mediated transport by <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors,</b> and, secondly, that, whereas acid phosphatase may be differentially controlled by androgens in the regenerating prostate, increases in the amount of cell proliferation and 5 alpha-reductase activity directly parallel increases in the nuclear concentration of <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors...</b>|$|R
25|$|Males {{typically}} have more skeletal muscle mass than females. Androgens promote the enlargement of skeletal muscle cells and probably {{act in a}} coordinated manner to function by acting on several cell types in skeletal muscle tissue. One cell type conveys hormone signals to generating muscle, the myoblast. Higher androgen levels lead to increased expression of <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor.</b> Fusion of myoblasts generates myotubes, in a process linked to <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor</b> levels.|$|E
25|$|Androgens {{have also}} been found to signal through {{membrane}} androgen receptors, which are distinct from the classical nuclear <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor.</b>|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing {{diuretic}} that {{is mainly}} {{used to treat}} low-renin hypertension, edema, hyperaldosteronism, and low potassium levels caused by other diuretics. It can cause high potassium levels (hyperkalemia) and is therefore contraindicated in people who have renal failure or already-elevated potassium levels. Spironolactone prevents the formation of androgens in the testes (though not in the adrenal glands) by inhibiting enzymes involved in androgen production. It is also an <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonist (that is, it prevents androgens from binding to and activating the <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor).</b>|$|E

25|$|Free {{testosterone}} (T) is transported {{into the}} cytoplasm of target tissue cells, {{where it can}} bind to the <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor,</b> or {{can be reduced to}} 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5α-reductase. DHT binds to the same <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor</b> even more strongly than testosterone, so that its androgenic potency is about 5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide also binds to {{and acts}} as an {{antagonist}} of the <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor</b> (AR) and hence is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) of some capacity. In accordance, it can produce gynecomastia and sexual dysfunction as side effects in men.|$|E

25|$|As an antiandrogen, {{ketoconazole}} operates {{through at}} least two mechanisms of action. First, and most notably, high oral doses of ketoconazole (e.g. 400mg three times per day) block both testicular and adrenal androgen biosynthesis, leading {{to a reduction in}} circulating testosterone levels. It produces this effect through inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which are involved in the synthesis and degradation of steroids, including the precursors of testosterone. Due to its efficacy at reducing systemic androgen levels, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a treatment for androgen-dependent prostate cancer. Second, ketoconazole is an <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonist, competing with androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for binding to the <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor.</b> This effect is thought to be quite weak however, even with high oral doses of ketoconazole.|$|E
25|$|Various {{studies have}} found direct genetic effects to account for at least 46% of the {{variation}} of timing of puberty in well-nourished populations. The genetic association of timing is strongest between mothers and daughters. The specific genes affecting timing are not yet known. Among the candidates is an <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor</b> gene.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{testosterone}} in humans and other vertebrates occur {{by way of}} multiple mechanisms: by activation of the <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor</b> (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Androgens such as testosterone have also been found to bind to and activate membrane androgen receptors.|$|E

25|$|High {{doses of}} progestogens exert {{negative}} {{feedback on the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by activating the progesterone receptor. As a result, they have antigonadotropic effects – that is, they suppress the gonadal production of sex hormones such as androgens. As such, sufficient dosages of progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, megestrol acetate, and MPA, can considerably lower androgen levels. In addition, certain other progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, megestrol acetate, drospirenone, and nomegestrol acetate, bind to and block the activation of the <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor.</b> On the other hand, certain other progestogens, including 19-nortestosterone derivatives like levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norethisterone, and norethisterone acetate, as well as, to a lesser extent, the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative MPA, have weak androgenic activity because they bind to and activate the <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor</b> similarly to testosterone, and may produce androgenic effects such as acne, hirsutism, and increased sex drive.|$|E
25|$|A 50% chance {{exists for}} a person to share the same X {{chromosome}} as his maternal grandfather. Because women have two X chromosomes, they have two copies of the <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor</b> gene, while men only have one. However, a person with a balding father also has a significantly greater chance of experiencing hair loss.|$|E
25|$|Besides, {{measuring}} the methylation (inactivation) {{status of the}} polymorphic human <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor</b> (HUMARA) located on X-chromosome is considered the most accurate method to assess clonality in female cancer biopsies. A great variety of tumors was tested by this method, some, such as renal cell carcinoma, found monoclonal while others (e.g. mesothelioma) were reported polyclonal.|$|E

30|$|Many {{chemicals}} are potential ligands of both, the estrogen and <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors.</b> Substantial similarity of EA receptors regarding their binding sites can be assumed. Only a few chemical classes interact only {{with one of}} these receptor families, such as phthalates [5]. Because any kind of binding of xenobiotics to estrogen or <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors</b> is undesirable, we pooled the results from studies with both receptor types for the identification of relevant structural alerts. With the same reasoning, we did not differentiate between agonistic and antagonistic activities, since binding to the receptor is a prerequisite for both activities.|$|R
50|$|Andarine is an orally active partial agonist for <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors.</b> It is less potent in both {{anabolic}} and androgenic effects {{than other}} SARMs. In an animal model of benign prostatic hypertrophy, andarine {{was shown to}} reduce prostate weight with similar efficacy to finasteride, but without producing any reduction in muscle mass or anti-androgenic side effects. This {{suggests that it is}} able to competitively block binding of dihydrotestosterone to its receptor targets in the prostate gland, but its partial agonist effects at <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors</b> prevent the side effects associated with the anti-androgenic drugs traditionally used for treatment of BPH.|$|R
25|$|Variants of the <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor</b> (AR) gene {{have also}} been discussed, in that non-right-handedness in men has been linked with greater CAG repeats in the AR gene, {{which in turn is}} {{associated}} with lower testosterone. A theory that high prenatal testosterone leads to neuronal and axonal loss in the corpus callosum is supported by this hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{brain is}} also {{affected}} by this sexual differentiation; the enzyme aromatase converts testosterone into estradiol {{that is responsible for}} masculinization of the brain in male mice. In humans, masculinization of the fetal brain appears, by observation of gender preference in patients with congenital diseases of androgen formation or <b>androgen</b> <b>receptor</b> function, to be associated with functional androgen receptors.|$|E
25|$|DDT is an {{endocrine}} disruptor. It {{is considered}} {{likely to be}} a human carcinogen although the majority of studies suggest it is not directly genotoxic.

The minor component o,p'-DDT has weak estrogenic activity.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to {{longer periods of}} development, other neurological and hormonal factors may contribute to sex-specific developmental differences. The amygdala is rich in <b>androgen</b> <b>receptors</b> - nuclear receptors that bind to testosterone. <b>Androgen</b> <b>receptors</b> {{play a role in}} the DNA binding that regulates gene expression. Though testosterone is present within the female hormonal systems, women have lower levels of testosterone than men. The abundance of testosterone in the male hormonal system may contribute to development. In addition, the grey matter volume on the amygdala is predicted by testosterone levels, which may also contribute to the increased mass of the male amygdala.|$|R
40|$|<b>Androgen</b> <b>receptors</b> {{are present}} in {{relevant}} numbers in osteoblasts.

Clinically, androgen action is crucial for the gain of bone mass during puberty {{and the maintenance of}} bone mass after puberty. Therefore, androgen replacement is necessary in hypogonadal men. However, the role of androgen replacement in partial androgen deficiency still remains unclear. Thus far, only testosterone has established its role in androgen replacement.
