Having already acted in or written {{for a number of}} films and {{television}} shows (including popular American television series Heroes), Kitamura was a relatively experienced actor compared to other cast members. He auditioned for the role of Katsuro via Skype from Los Angeles after the casting director saw him on television and recommended him for the role. The rest of the cast did not meet Kitamura until the day before shooting commenced.|$|E

5|$|Business US Highway41 (Bus. US41) {{was a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway that}} served as a business loop off US41 and M-28 in Marquette, Michigan, along Washington <b>and</b> <b>Front</b> streets. The streets serve the downtown area of Marquette and are bordered by several commercial properties and businesses. Those two streets originate with the early founding of the city {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. Jurisdiction over them was transferred to the city as part of a highway swap that resulted in the decommissioning of the trunkline in 2005. It was also previously co-designated Bus. M-28, mirroring the Bus. US41/Bus. M-28 designation previously used along Bus. M-28 in Ishpeming and Negaunee. Washington <b>and</b> <b>Front</b> streets had been a part of the state highway system since the 1910s, and a part of the United States Numbered Highway System since 1926. The business loop designation dates back to the 1960s and was removed in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Currently, Caroline never reaches {{water at}} either ends. The 1829 map, however, shows it {{accessing}} the Gulf of Mexico at both termini.

This {{is confirmed by}} {{a map of the}} island from the early 1900s, which depicts Caroline abutting a breakwater at its southwestern end. Eventually, the street was excluded from the lot of the Truman Annex, and disconnected from the water at its northeastern terminus by the construction of the former City Electric Power Plant on new land.|$|E

Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly {{when the wind}} is blowing towards the animals, indicating the sense of smell is more important than sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E

With the session ending under yellow flags, both Force India and both McLaren drivers joined Sainz in elimination, with Nico Hülkenberg fastest in eleventh place on the grid.

5|$|Within {{the context}} of the battle itself, the failure of the Red Army to {{properly}} regroup during the prelude to the battle and the ability of the Germans to effectively collect intelligence on Soviet movements {{played an important role in}} the outcome. Poor Soviet performance in the north and equally poor intelligence-gathering at the hands of Stavka <b>and</b> <b>front</b> headquarters, also eventually spelled doom for the offensive. Nonetheless, despite this poor performance, it underscored a dedicated evolution of operations and tactics within the Red Army which borrowed and refined the pre-war theory, Soviet deep battle.|$|E
5|$|Zygoballus sexpunctatus is {{a species}} of jumping spider which occurs in the southeastern United States {{where it can be}} found in a variety of grassy habitats.

The male has distinctive enlarged chelicerae (the mouthparts used for grasping prey) <b>and</b> <b>front</b> femora (the third, and typically largest, leg segments). Like many jumping spiders, Z. sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized courtship and agonistic behavior.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} the {{business}} loop was still under state control, it was maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as {{a segment of the}} State Trunkline Highway System. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracked the volume of traffic that used Bus. US41. These volumes were expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. In the department's last survey, conducted in 2004, there were 10,272vehicles per day using Washington Street between Lincoln Avenue <b>and</b> <b>Front</b> Street, the lowest traffic count for the trunkline. The highest volume was 19,036vehicles between McClellan and Lincoln Avenues, while the Front Street section received 16,309vehicles on an average day. The former business loop has not been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|During his spell in Sauber, in the 1991 Sportscar World Championship, Schumacher was {{involved}} in a serious incident with Derek Warwick in that year's 430 km of Nürburgring. While trying to set his flying lap in qualifying, Schumacher encountered Warwick's Jaguar on a slow lap resulting in lost time for Schumacher. As retaliation for being in his way, Schumacher swerved the Sauber into Warwick's car, hitting the Jaguar's nose <b>and</b> <b>front</b> wheel. Enraged by the German's attitude, Warwick drove to the pits and chased a fleeing Schumacher on foot through the Sauber pits. He eventually caught up with Schumacher, and it took intervention from Jochen Mass to prevent Warwick physically assaulting Schumacher.|$|E
5|$|Dzungariotherium orgosensis was {{described}} in 1973 based on fossilsmainly teethfrom Dzungaria in Xinjiang, northwest China. In 2017, a new species, P. huangheense, was named based on jaw elements from the Hanjiajing Formation in the Gansu Province of China; the name refers to the nearby Huanghe River. P. huangheense differs from P. bugtiense only in the anatomy of the rear portion of the jaw, {{as well as its}} larger size. A multitude of other species and genus namesmostly based on differences in size, snout shape, <b>and</b> <b>front</b> tooth arrangementhave been coined for various indricothere remains.
