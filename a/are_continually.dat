5|$|Many hybrid {{zones are}} known where the ranges of two species meet, and hybrids <b>are</b> <b>continually</b> {{produced}} in great numbers. These hybrid zones are useful as biological model systems {{for studying the}} mechanisms of speciation. Recently DNA analysis of a bear shot by a hunter in the North West Territories confirmed the existence of naturally-occurring and fertile grizzlyâ€“polar bear hybrids.|$|E
5|$|The skin of {{crocodilians}} {{is thick}} and cornified, and is clad in non-overlapping scales known as scutes, arranged in regular rows and patterns. These scales <b>are</b> <b>continually</b> being produced by cell {{division in the}} underlying layer of the epidermis, the stratum germinativum, and the surface of individual scutes sloughs off periodically. The outer surface of the scutes consists of the relatively rigid beta-keratin while the hinge region between the scutes contains only the more pliable alpha-keratin.|$|E
5|$|Peter Molydeux is a Twitter account {{presented}} as a parody of the game designer Peter Molyneux. Created by game artist Adam Capone in 2009, it posts audacious game design ideas {{in the style of}} Molyneux. The account presents Molyneux as a tragicomic character with unrelenting, creative ideas that <b>are</b> <b>continually</b> received by an apathetic audience. Over time, the account evolved from a Molyneux-based persona into a list of potential game concepts. A common theme of the tweets is the untapped potential of emotional game experiences. Molyneux came to appreciate the parody, and has since met Capone in person.|$|E

5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a chaotic system. As a result, small changes to {{one part of}} the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tides or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather {{more than a few days}} in advance, weather forecasters <b>are</b> <b>continually</b> working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E
5|$|The early 1900s lacked modern {{forecasting}} and documentation. The hurricane database {{from these}} years is sometimes {{found to be}} incomplete or incorrect, and new storms <b>are</b> <b>continually</b> being added {{as part of the}} ongoing Atlantic hurricane reanalysis. The period from 1911 through 1914 was reanalyzed in 2005. Two previously unknown tropical cyclones were identified using records including historical weather maps and ship reports, and information on the known storms was amended and corrected. These storms are referred to simply by their number in chronological order, since tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean were not given official names until much later.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} bark {{is known as}} the phloem and this is involved in the transport of the sap containing the sugars made by photosynthesis {{to other parts of the}} tree. It is a soft spongy layer of living cells, some of which are arranged end to end to form tubes. These are supported by parenchyma cells which provide padding and include fibres for strengthening the tissue. Inside the phloem is a layer of undifferentiated cells one cell thick called the vascular cambium layer. The cells <b>are</b> <b>continually</b> dividing, creating phloem cells on the outside and wood cells known as xylem on the inside.|$|E

The strong sentiment of love and devotion with which he inspired all around him at the commencement of his career, was now gone, and his generals and officers <b>were</b> <b>continually</b> planning schemes to depose him from the power which he seemed no longer to {{have the energy to}} wield; or, at least, Alexander <b>was</b> <b>continually</b> suspecting that such plans were formed, and he was kept in a continual state of uneasiness and anxiety in discovering and punishing them.|$|R

5|$|Tiger {{shark teeth}} are unique with very sharp, {{pronounced}} serrations and an unmistakable sideways pointing tip. Such dentition has developed to slice through flesh, bone, and other tough substances such as turtle shells. Like most sharks, its teeth <b>are</b> <b>continually</b> replaced by rows of new teeth throughout the sharks life. Relative to the shark's size, tiger shark teeth are considerably shorter {{than those of}} a great white shark, however they are nearly as broad as the root as the great whites teeth and are arguably better suited to slicing through hard-surfaced prey.|$|E
5|$|Impact events <b>are</b> <b>continually</b> {{occurring}} on {{the lunar}} surface. The most common events are {{those associated with}} micrometeorites, as might be encountered during meteor showers. Impact flashes from such events have been detected from multiple and simultaneous Earth-based observations. Tables of impacts recorded by video cameras exist for years since 2005 {{many of which are}} associated with meteor showers. Furthermore, impact clouds were detected following the crash of ESA's SMART-1 spacecraft, India's Moon Impact Probe and NASA's LCROSS. Impact events leave a visible scar on the surface, and these could be detected by analyzing before and after photos of sufficiently high resolution. No impact craters formed between the Clementine (global resolution 100 metre, selected areas 7-20 metre) and SMART-1 (resolution 50 metre) missions have been identified.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} in which multiple Alien Bounty Hunters appear involved {{the use of}} motion control, a method in which a motion-control camera on a computerized module is repeatedly run through the same motion while elements <b>are</b> <b>continually</b> added. The shot, according to John Wash, {{was one of the}} few times in the series in which the production crew was able to use motion control and therefore presented a slight challenge. In the filming of the sequence, both a blank plate, for just the set, and lighting elements, that were in the set, were shot before the production crew filmed five different passes, each one with the Alien Bounty Hunter in a different position. The production crew were finally able to clone the Bounty Hunter by blending all the passes together.|$|E

5|$|It then {{occurred}} to me that these causes or their equivalents <b>are</b> <b>continually</b> acting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it {{occurred to}} me to ask the question, why do some die and some live? And the answer was clearly, on the whole the best fitted live... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.|$|E
