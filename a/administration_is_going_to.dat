International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the World Bank collaborate with various stakeholders for global off-grid lighting market for reliable electricity {{to people who have}} no access to national grids. A neutral, independent, not for profit association called Global Off-Grid Lighting Association (GOGLA) was conceived out of a joint World Bank/IFC Lighting Africa and private sector effort in 2012. India is the first Asian lighting programs for IFC. Lighting Asia/India program was planned to enable access of two million rural Indians to off-grid lighting solutions by 2015. The program is designed with a series of interventions to alter market behavior by removing specific barriers, for example, the market spoilage created by poor products, lack of information on quality products and on distribution channels, lack of financing for companies and consumers, lack of awareness that quality solar appliances are affordable and viableIndia's first smart village has been developed by Eco Needs Foundation http://www.econeeds.org/ at Dhanora village of Rajasthan. The concept is prepared by Prof. Priyanand Agale, Dr. Satyapal Singh Meena an officer of Indian Revenue Service(IRS) http://epaper.bhaskar.com/detail/1202310/52621824785/0/map/tabs-1/05-26-2017/14/6/image/ and Mr. Attdeep Agale. This concept consists of five elements Retrofitting, Redevelopment, Greenfield, e-Pan and Livelihood. Under the project of smart village the Foundation is adopting villages and putting efforts for sustainable development by providing basic amenities like sanitation, safe drinking water, internal road, tree plantation, water conservation. The Foundation is also working for inculcating moral values in the society and for improving the standard of living of the villagers. The Foundation has developed Village Dhanora, Teh. Bari, District Dholpur, one of the remotely situated village of Rajasthan as India’s First Smart Village. The village is situated 30 km away from Dholpur district head quarter and 248 Km from Jaipur city, Capital of Rajasthan State of India. The population of the village was nearly about 2000 having no sanitation facility, potable water facility, which were adversely causing the health of the villagers. The internal roads are also not there and it causes great hardship to the people especially in rainy season. Owing to unawareness and non-availability of sanitation facility and toilets the people of the village use to go open for defecation. There are other problems also which villagers were facing such as Fluoride concentration in drinking water, No water conservation System, Encroachment on the roads, Electrical power fluctuation No outcome base education, Unemployment and poverty. ProF. Priyanand Agale Founder, president of Foundation and Dr. Satyapal Singh Meena officer of the Indian Revenue service has converted this village as India's first Smart Village and now Dhanora has become a role model of Rural Development. Following are the major success achieved within a short span of two years of the project and project is still underway:1. Construction of 822 toilets in the Panchayat area with the help of district administration and public participation accordingly, the Dhanora Gram Panchayat has been declared as the first “Open Defecation Free” (ODF) Panchayat by District Administration.2. Village Dhanora become India’s first village having sewerage line with treatment plant. The Foundation has laid down nearly 2 Km long sewerage line of diameter 450 mm in the village. Each of the toilets of Dhanora village have been connected to sewerage line with inspection chambers.3. Construction of nearly 2 Km long cement concrete internal roads constructed with 3.5 m to 4.5 m width with high quality.4. Construction of eight Percolation tank connecting with nearly 2.5 Km artificial channel of 10 feet in width and 10 feet in depth for water conservation and ground water recharge with public participation {{and with the help of}} government having groundwater recharge capacity of 97.49 Million liters in one time recharge, which will provide irrigation facility to farms of the village and nearby villages resulting into economic growth of farmers.5. The work of the removal of encroachments and road widening has been completed without using any police force. Now the whole village is having motorable road in the village.6. Construction of nearly 2 km approach road at Dhodekapura village of the Dhanora Panchayat, which was not done in last 65 years.7. The police <b>Administration</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> declare the village as “APRADH MUKKTA GAON” (Crime Free Village), no case or FIR in Police Station.8. village Dhanora has been converted into an Art gallery. The paintings in the village are spreading social awareness among villagers 9. The foundation stone for community centre and information centre has been laid down, work under progress. Work of solar street light, skill development centre, library, meditation centre, sport complex, Wi-Fi facility, and community toilet will be taken up in due course of time and as per availability of funds.|$|E

But it hasn't and the policy influence of the idea of poverty has fallen away. I explain this by looking at the conditions under which good ideas are likely to make it to policy status. Good ideas tend to be simple to understand; resonate with people's experiences of life; have leadership and a policy community around them; fit into program and resource structures of governments and seem capable of solving immediate problems. The idea of eradicating poverty has lost these features. For example, for the past 20 years poverty ideas have been knocked off their perch by economic reform ideas. Not only are there these competing economic ideas (which are claimed to be a solution to poverty), there is also a raft of new social capital ideas making claims on policy resources. The idea of poverty has been obfuscated such that we can't agree what it means any more or how to measure it or who is responsible for tackling it. Which, of course, means no one can be held accountable. Out of the muddle I suggest a way forward to make the idea influential again. For example, having some national goals and agreeing some basic language and targets would be a good start...|$|R

40|$|The Morrill Act of 1862, a {{piece of}} federal {{legislation}} enacted {{a century and a}} half ago, lives on today. That law allocated thousands of acres of federal land to state governments, based on the size of their congressional delegations, so they could establish colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts and give a college education, liberal and practical, to students who could not otherwise afford one. The Morrill Act lives on because the 2 ̆ 2 land-grant colleges 2 ̆ 2 it endowed with financial resources still exist today, operating on billion-dollar budgets and enrolling tens of thousands of students. Further, at least at Iowa State University, each incoming president 2 ̆ 7 s in-augural address has involved an explanation of the land-grant idea. In the past three decades, that explanation has devolved from the broad view, held for a century, that land-grant colleges should prepare their students to be productive economically and politically, that they should educate them to be competent engineers and agriculturists as well as civic-minded people capable of acting not just in someone 2 ̆ 7 s private interest, but in their commu-nity 2 ̆ 7 s - their polity 2 ̆ 7 s - public interest. The latest presidents of Iowa State have, since the 1980 s, put forward an explanation of the land-grant idea that places economic values, rather than politi-cal values, at the center of the university 2 ̆ 7 s existence. The work of historians of agriculture and the land-grant colleges has not been much better, the former paying little attention to the land-grant colleges and the latter more often than not failing to see the larger context in which the col-leges were created and have existed. This thesis investigates the ideology that played a role in Iowa State University 2 ̆ 7 s creation in the late 1850 s and early 1860 s as the Iowa State Agricultural College and Model Farm. In the mid- to late 1850 s, acting out of a concern for declining soil fertility (or the potential for it), the Iowa State Agricultural Society formulated an ideology of sustainable land use, scientific inves-tigation of farming techniques, and the equal dignity of labor (agricultural and mechanical work) with the more esteemed professions. The Society turned to a number of educational institutions, including annual fairs, agricultural periodicals, seed distribution programs by the federal govern-ment, township-level farmers 2 ̆ 7 clubs, the state geological survey, and the state agricultural college, chartered in 1858, before the Morrill Act 2 ̆ 7 s passage. The author undertook this thesis because he believes that, if Iowa State 2 ̆ 7 s <b>administration</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> invoke the history of the Morrill Act to rationalize their actions, they ought to know what that history is...|$|R

40|$|Economies of Valuation and Desire: How New Deal Photography Made the Amish Modern" connects two {{substantial}} {{bodies of}} scholarship: the visual {{culture of the}} New Deal, and twentieth-century visual and literary representations of religious sub-cultures in the United States. Its primary objectives are two-fold. First, it provides an alternative model for the Great Depression as a historical narrative and popular concept in the American imagination. The images {{at the center of}} my dissertation propose a counter-narrative to those typically offered, which describe great waves of migration across the landscape - narratives of Okies, and other de-territorialized American identities moving through shifting topographies of loss and renewal. In contrast, the earliest group of photographs to depict consenting Amish subjects in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania make visible an American community's firm rootedness to a particular place, and moreover, the cost of that endurance to other citizens. Second, the project contributes to the field of Anabaptist Studies a critical assessment of twentieth-century photographs of the photography-averse Amish, a subject that has yet to receive consideration in any field. Since they arose as a distinct group within the Amish Church in 1865, the Old Order have exercised serious proscriptions against photography as both act and object. Yet images of Amish individuals have proliferated in American visual culture since the early twentieth century and contribute to our collective idea of the community as insular, old-fashioned, and curiously benign. A particular set of New Deal photographs act as a pivot point in a history of picturing the Old Order - they are paradoxical images because they present the Anabaptist community as nearly extinct {{on the periphery of the}} modern world, yet also a viable threat to central tenets of multiple modernisms. Furthermore, it is precisely the Old Order's particular objections to photography that constitute some of the most serious challenges to established ideas of Modernism. "Economies of Valuation and Desire" considers photographs by Irving Rusinow taken for the American Farm Community Study, a sociological research endeavor directed by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics from 1938 to 1942. As the Bureau's Head Field Photographer, the little-known Rusinow replaced Dorothea Lange, who left in 1940 to pursue work on a Guggenheim Fellowship. The Study was comprised of six rural communities, including the Lancaster Amish, that the Bureau's team of sociologists selected as representative of the nation's rural inhabitants. In 1941, Rusinow produced about 1, 000 photographs of these communities; however, only 76 of them were published with the Study's technical reports between 1942 and 1945. The project investigates a small portion of the photographer's (published and unpublished) images within the context of the Study's ultimate objective: to structure the six communities into a legible "continuum of stability and instability" and in the process, uncover cultural, environmental, and agricultural variables that led to a community's economic success or failure. The Community Study was in the service of the Bureau's primary program, Federal-County Land-Use Planning; the second half of the chapter considers the possibilities of Rusinow's photographs for this larger program. Land-Use Planning facilitated direct dialogue between all agricultural stakeholders in order to propose and enact policy change. Bureau-organized municipal meetings brought together farmers, university agriculture extension agents, social scientists, Washington bureaucrats, and farm union representatives who collaborated to literally redraw maps of local topographies as the first step towards higher agricultural profits and more economically resilient communities. Land-Use Planning was tasked with inculcating big business methods into agriculture, but doing so with a grassroots democratic approach that required "inside" information about each of the communities in question. To this end, Rusinow's camera was the program's fundamental research tool, freely oscillating between ethnographic and anthropological looking at (O) ther Americans. His photographs substantially reframe established narratives about the New Deal; they muddy (or unexpectedly illuminate) Roy Stryker's assertion that the most famous government photography project, enabled by the Farm Security <b>Administration,</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> "introduce America to Americans. " I argue that Land-Use Planning photography was deployed as a mode of surveillance in the countryside, a tool for social gardening with which the vulnerabilities of peripheral populations could be identified, ordered, and "corrected. ...|$|R
5000|$|In UK law, the <b>administration</b> regime <b>is</b> {{governed by}} the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002. An [...] "administrator" [...] can be {{appointed}} without petitioning the court by the holder of a floating charge (created since 15 September 2003), by the company or by its directors. Other creditors must petition the court to appoint an administrator. The administrator must act {{in the interests of}} all the creditors and attempt to rescue the company as a going concern. If this proves impossible he or she must work to maximise the recovery of the creditors as a whole. Only then may the administrator attempt to realise property in favour of one or more secured creditor. A firm <b>is</b> usually in <b>Administration</b> for no more than 12 months, after which an extension from the court can be produced at the courts discretion. [...] <b>Administration</b> <b>is</b> analogous <b>to</b> <b>going</b> into [...] "Chapter 11" [...] in the United States, although there are certain key differences, mainly stemming from the fact that English law does not include the debtor in possession concept. During the reorganisation period, as a result, the administrator usually runs the business rather than the directors, and any additional liquidity requirements effectively have to be met by funds provided by existing creditors rather than by any super-senior 'DIP financing'.|$|R
40|$|Contrary to the {{significance}} that HSBC and its comprador office {{made on the}} modernisation in China {{at the turn of}} the 19 th and the 20 th Century, studies about the Bank’s expansion in the Beijing-Tianjin area were exceptionally limited. In this research, the importance of HSBC’s expansion to North China in the 1880 s will be primarily examined by the Bank and its comprador office’s roles in the railways development in North China. During this process, Wu Jim-pah, as the first comprador of HSBC in Tianjin, offered significant aids in establishing HSBC’s collaboration with the Qing Court and the influential Bei-yang Ministry under Li Hong-zhang’s <b>administration.</b> This research <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> examine Wu Jim-pah’s career and personal development in late Qing Huizhou, Suzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin and Beijing, so as to answer a series of questions related to China’s social-economic reforms and its earliest capitalists’ formation {{at the turn of the}} centuries. Moreover, acts as the first academic study focusing on Wu Jim-pah’s participation in the early modernisation projects of late Qing China, this research put the collection and classification of historical materials in the central place. The findings of primary resources from the archives in China and overseas, namely, the Institute of History and Philology of Academia Sinica in Taipei, the National Library of China, the Shanghai Library, the Southwest Jiao-tong University, the Tianjin Academy of Social Sciences (TASS), the HSBC Group Archives, London School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), as well as the Public Record Office at Kew, London, could be regarded as the most valuable part of this research. published_or_final_versionHumanities and Social SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Curs acadèmic 2016 / 2017 The {{computerization}} {{of society}} is a fact more than evident nowadays and this has made that all areas benefit from its advantages and the Public <b>Administrations</b> <b>were</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less. They have always {{been in touch with}} the newest technologies of the moment but it is from the sixties when automation begins. New technologies anticipated making revolutionary changes, modernizing administrations but according to Heeks (1999), managers have ignored, isolated or idolized but integrated ICT within the management of the public organizations. In the case that concerns us, local governments, there is a greater lack of resources, means, personal or knowledge of citizens is smaller. So that, this is what led me or motivated me to identify what had been the modifications that new technologies had made and see if the e-government have been fully consolidated and {{if it had not been}} done, to obtain a proposal that would be useful for local public administrations. This project presents the results of a research on e-government in Spain, taking as case studies the local governments of Castellón de la Plana and Atzeneta del Maestrat. The objective was to collect on the current situation of these local governments and their relationship with the citizens. According to his narration “Electronic Administration: Why implement a policy of management of institutional processes in public administrations,” García-González (2016) shows us that studies on e-government in Spain are insufficient and that there is no community model of this complete and finished and less of local electronic administration. First, this study develops a theoretical framework on new technologies and egovernment, the role it plays on the other. Secondly, we review the different researches on the use of new technologies and electronic administration through statistics of Telefónica Foundation, INE, studies such as García-González. Below, we provide two examples of local administrations with the aim of seeing the relationship that citizens have with their administrations telematically as well as the change that is made in its structure by having to adapt to the new modifications. In the study of the cases, we sent two questionnaires to the heads of the municipalities. The questionnaire consisted of twelve questions, related to the use of ICT (Information and Communication technologies) in the local government, the effect of the introduction of ICT in its organizational structure and in the relationship with citizens. Finally, we make a proposal for improvement after obtaining the results of the research. This is based in a good communication to the citizen, so we propose an adequate communication plan. And on the other hand the employees must be qualified and that the number of these is the appropriate one for the correct implementation of the electronic administration. The conclusions we reach are the lack of knowledge on the part of the citizen of all the formalities, procedures of the electronic administration, in general how to use the services with the administration. For this, and another of the conclusions that we obtain is that the staff of employees must be greater to establish correctly the electronic administration, to improve the treatment with the citizens and the services that lend to this one...|$|R
