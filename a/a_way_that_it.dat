5|$|Both non-selective {{glucocorticoids}} {{and selective}} glucocorticoid receptor agonists work by binding to and activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In contrast to glucocorticoids, which activate the GR {{to work through}} (at least) two signal transduction pathways, SEGRAMs activate the GR in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> only operates {{through one of the}} two main possible pathways.|$|E

5|$|This {{class of}} {{objections}} is more radical than the above, claiming {{that a major}} aspect of evolution is not merely unscientific or implausible, but rather impossible, because it contradicts some other law of nature or is constrained in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> cannot produce the biological diversity of the world.|$|E

Today, the park still features more than 200 exotic tree and shrub species, including a wide variety of palm trees, laurels, cypresses, olive trees, and evergreen viburnum, among many others.|$|E
5|$|The amendment's {{first section}} {{includes}} several clauses: the Citizenship Clause, Privileges or Immunities Clause, Due Process Clause, and Equal Protection Clause. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), which had held that Americans descended from African slaves {{could not be}} citizens of the United States. The Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> does very little.|$|E

5|$|As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} {{highlight}} {{the differences between}} men and women as much as she emphasizes the importance of virtue in Original Stories. Moreover, she defines virtue in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, virtue was tied to femininity and chastity, but Wollstonecraft’s text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should be characterized by reason and self-control. Myers has also pointed out that Mrs. Mason’s desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and philosophers such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary status of their gender.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the caps}} {{are covered by}} a peridium—an outer {{covering}} layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins to dry out, {{the lower part of}} the peridium starts to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal slits near where the peridium attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the slits may appear higher up on the peridium, in others, the peridium rips more irregularly. The peridium may also rip in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> appears as if there is a ring at the top of the stem. The torn peridium exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or lamellae, some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it becomes tough and brittle as it dries out. The flesh is firm when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.|$|E
5|$|The {{auxiliary}} {{system is}} powered via a separate transformer winding feeding three independent {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT) converters each providing a three-phase 400volt system. The locomotive is designed {{with an open}} system architecture that can be adapted later. Diagnostic information is available to the driver and can be sent to the control center via GSM-R. The locomotive has a large and bright cab with space for up to three people. The second series of locomotives have an improved driver's chair, which has been retrofitted on the older trains. The machine room has a center hallway. All high-current equipment is located behind a door which can only be opened with a special key. This key is locked in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> cannot be accessed without grounding the locomotive, and similarly the locomotive cannot be ungrounded again until the key is back in place.|$|E

5|$|When {{conceived}} {{in the nineteenth}} century, the electric fire engine was proposed to replace the steam fire engine in use at the time. It was to be constructed in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would use a supply of electrical power that came from a central station whereby electricity could be distributed to various covered stations and city supply points. This would require underground or overhead wiring {{similar to that used}} for electric light, trolleys, and other power users of the time. It was thought that the wiring could supply electricity to various outlet posts at strategic places throughout a city or fire protected district. These outlets would supply the necessary current to the fire-engine's electric motor. The vehicle itself was to be hauled by horses and would consist of a carriage wagon with an electric motor-powered water pump permanently mounted atop. There would be cables from the motor that would connect to the outlet post to obtain the required supply of electrical current.|$|E
5|$|Zagame is {{a member}} of and plays club water polo for the Cronulla Sharks Water Polo Club in the National Water Polo League. During the 2009 season, she scored 76 goals. She played for the team in 2010, {{including}} the finals tournament, during which she was named in the league final's All Star team. She has twice set season goal-scoring records while playing in the league, with the second time coming in a 2010 game when her team beat Adelaide at home in the Sutherland Leisure Centre. She challenges opposition players in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> frequently results in her fouling out of games. She was the captain of the team during the 2011 season. In 2012, she played briefly with the club before taking a break from the team following their 18 February 2012 game to attend the national team training camp. Her last game before the break was against the Balmain Tigers. As a member of the team, she helped win the first two games of the season 8–4 and 7–4.|$|E
