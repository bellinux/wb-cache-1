40|$|<b>A</b> {{thermally}} responsive <b>polyurethane</b> {{shape memory}} polymer (SMP) can be actuated in water through a hydrogen bonding interaction between {{water and the}} SMP. In this work, we present a comprehensive approach to quantify the hydrogen bonding on the shape recovery behavior of <b>a</b> <b>polyurethane</b> SMP. The stimuli response to the hydrogen bonding of the polyurethane SMP was investigated in ethanol/water mixtures by varying the water content. It was found that depending on the water content, the SMP features a critical hydrogen bonding strength associated with its shape recovery behavior. The Hildebrand solubility parameter theory was employed to quantitatively identify and separate the hydrogen bonding effect of the ethanol/water mixture on the shape recovery ratio and the time. Furthermore, a phenomenological model was developed to predict the glass transition temperature and the shape recovery time of <b>a</b> <b>polyurethane</b> SMP and was verified by the available experimental results...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} plasma-treated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that are composited into <b>a</b> <b>polyurethane</b> (PU) film. This report especially focused on one of mechanical properties of PU film, the wear resistance, to find how the plasma-treated CNTs give contributions to improve the resistance. Our experimental results suggested that plasma-treated CNTs significantly enhanced the wear resistance when the CNTs treated with the plasma that was made of nitrogen–carbon dioxide mixture gas. We also made fluorescence measurements to find the possible causes of the improvement. The measurement showed that {{the surface of the}} CNTs treated with nitrogen– carbon dioxide plasma had an indication of isocyanate group, which generally hardens PU film. The plasma likely attached the functional group on CNTs, and then the CNTs added extra wear resistance of <b>a</b> <b>polyurethane</b> film...|$|R
