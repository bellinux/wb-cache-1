5|$|Warning {{coloration}} {{can succeed}} either through inborn behaviour (instinct) {{on the part}} of potential predators, or through a learned <b>avoidance.</b> Either can lead to various forms of mimicry. Experiments show that <b>avoidance</b> is learned in birds, mammals, lizards, and amphibians, but that some birds such as great tits have inborn <b>avoidance</b> of certain colours and patterns such as black and yellow stripes.|$|E

40|$|Authority as it {{operates}} {{in the daily}} lives of married women in Gcaleka society is reinforced and maintained by a body of <b>avoidances</b> which women need to observe during their married lives. <b>Avoidances</b> constitute part of the control system in the society whereby wives are being 'kept in their place'. <b>Avoidances</b> do not only restrict her, but also safeguard her position and her interests. Lines of authority emerge through the process of interaction; the structure reveals itself as <b>avoidances</b> are acted out in time and space. This study was conducted in Qwaninga, an administrative area in the coastal area of the Willowvale district, Transkei. The research started out as a study of ritual impurity and the status of women in a traditional, 'red' Gcaleka society. It soon became clear that pollution practices and beliefs associated with women form part of a greater body of <b>avoidances</b> which women need to observe during their married lives. <b>Avoidances</b> entail economic, dietary, sexual, linguistic and spatial prohibitions; as well as restrictions concerning what a woman is supposed to wear, and her withdrawal from social life. These restrictions are enforced through certain ritual and other sanctions. Three forms of <b>avoidances</b> are identified in this study, and are discussed and analysed. <b>Avoidances</b> are found in the everyday male/female division in society; in the ways through which the wife shows respect towards her husband and her in-laws (especially her husband's ancestors); and in the reproductive situations a woman finds herself in from time to time. In many anthropological studies in the past women have often been hidden in the background. This study is an attempt to give women the prominence they should be given, to show that nonwestern women are not as subordinated as people in Western society like to assume. In Gcaleka society the authority structure affecting the position of women is not only based on a distinction being made between males and females. It will be shown that a finer authority structure operates in this society whereby gender as well as age and kinship distinctions are being made. These distinctions constitute a system of classification which is safeguarded and protected by the <b>avoidances</b> and other restrictions imposed on women. ...|$|R

40|$|The Central Utility Plant (CUP) at D/FW Airport is a {{facility}} that was first placed in operation during the Fall of 1973 and has continuously operated since that time. The original plant produced steam for heating and for chilled water generation via condensing turbine type centrifugal chiller drives. Its original service area was 1. 4 million square feet. The original utilities costs were 27 cents per MCF for natural gas and 0. 85 cents per KWH for electricity. The 1974 energy budget was slightly less than $ 500, 000. 00. Currently this same plant, after a continuous series of improvements, serves over 3 million square feet utilizing less chiller capacity and less boiler capacity than was used in 1974. The energy usage per square foot of facility served has been reduced by at least 65 % {{and the value of}} the accumulated annual energy cost <b>avoidances</b> from January 1, 1975 to present exceeds $ 17, 000, 000. 00 The present value of those cost <b>avoidances</b> would be $ 21, 718, 000. 00 if treasury bill interest rates were applied to these cost <b>avoidances</b> as they were being accumulated. The total cost of capital improvements to achieve these savings was less than 2 million dollars of which 1. 5 million has been spent during the last two years. In 1984 the total utility cost for operating this plant was less than 1. 5 million dollars. The {{bottom line is that the}} service area has increased by a factor of 2. 15, the cost of natural gas has increased by a factor of 15, the electric service cost increased by a factor of 6 and the utility service cost to the tenant has increased less than 25 % on a per square foot basis. The cost <b>avoidances</b> were generated primarily by the elimination of reheat for space conditioning and modifications and improvements to the central heating and cooling equipment. The remainder of this paper will deal with the latter and more specifically with the implementation and utilization of variable frequency drives (VFD) and direct digital controls (DDC) to improve the efficiency of chilled water generation and distribution systems...|$|R
5|$|A {{capacity}} for aggressive behavior {{should not be}} overstated with the giant otter. Researchers emphasize that even between groups, conflict <b>avoidance</b> is generally adopted.

5|$|According to Tough, it is {{unlikely}} that the <b>avoidance</b> of immediate dangers and prevention of future catastrophes would be conducted through radio, as these tasks would demand constant surveillance and quick action. However, cultural cooperation might take place through radio or a space probe in the Solar System, as radio waves could be used to communicate information about advanced technologies and cultures to humanity.|$|E
5|$|Another nocturnal {{adaptation}} {{can be seen}} in kangaroo rats, which exhibit moonlight <b>avoidance.</b> These rodents forage {{in relatively}} open habitats and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. In controlled experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar responses in their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to reduce predation risk.|$|E
50|$|All {{of these}} exchanges {{have contributed to}} water savings, and savings in fuel and input chemicals. Wastes were also avoided through these interchanges. For example, in 1997, Asnaes (the power station) saved 30,000 tons of coal (~2% of throughput) by using Statoil (large oil refinery) fuel gas. And 200,000 tons of fly ash and clinker were avoided from Asnaes landfill. These {{resources}} savings and waste <b>avoidances,</b> documented before 1997, are illustrated in the tables to the right.|$|R
5000|$|An {{internal}} system of social stratification probably began in that period, {{although it is}} also {{believed to be a}} remnant of the Jewish (pre-conversion) period. This system distinguished a kind of aristocracy, called [...] "orella alta" [...] (literally [...] "high ears"), {{from the rest of the}} group, [...] "orella baixa" [...] ("low ears"). Along with other distinctions based on religion, professions, and parentage this configured a tapestry of alliances and <b>avoidances</b> among surnames, which had a great influence on endogamistic practices of the period.|$|R

50|$|Cognitive {{behavioural}} therapy (CBT) {{is used by}} OTs to treat SAD and other mood disorders. Originally developed by Beck and colleagues, CBT aims to help clients identify the expectations and interpretations that can lead them towards depression and anxiety; adjust to reality; and break through their <b>avoidances</b> and inhibitions. When implemented appropriately, it can help people change their cognitive processes, which may then correspond with changes in their feelings and behaviours. CBT for SAD focuses on the early identification of negative anticipatory thoughts and behavior changes associated with the winter season, and helps clients develop coping skills to address these changes.|$|R
5|$|Difficulty delaying {{gratification}} {{also plays}} a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in anxiety is <b>avoidance</b> of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with <b>avoidance,</b> a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the <b>avoidance.</b> Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E
