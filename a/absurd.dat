5|$|Favorinus {{argued that}} it was <b>absurd</b> to imagine that stars and planets would affect human bodies {{in the same way as}} they affect the tides, and equally <b>absurd</b> that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people's fates. Sextus Empiricus {{argued that it}} was <b>absurd</b> to link human {{attributes}} with myths about the signs of the zodiac. Carneades argued that belief in fate denies free will and morality; that people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.|$|E
5|$|Laputa, {{a fictional}} island full of <b>absurd</b> inventions put by Jonathan Swift in Gulliver's Travels to mock the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|Munroe {{announced}} in March, 2014 {{that he had}} signed a deal with publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt to compile {{a large number of}} his What If? entries into a book. What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to <b>Absurd</b> Hypothetical Questions would eventually be released in September that year.|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{the film}} has {{received}} acclaim from both critics and audience for its zany antics and pratfalls, <b>absurd</b> situations and misunderstandings, perfect sense of comic timing, completely screwball cast, series of lunatic and hare-brained misadventures, disasters, light-hearted surprises and romantic comedy.|$|E
5|$|While echoing {{criticism}} about {{the exclusion of}} lesbian concerns and the distortions contained in the broadcast, Browning went on to note that sexual freedom has {{always been part of}} the gay male agenda {{and that it would be}} <b>absurd</b> to pretend otherwise.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, {{while doing}} {{promotion}} for the album, the band were asked what shows {{they would like}} to appear on. The band jokingly replied (possibly while intoxicated) that {{they would like to}} appear on Dance Party USA, since it was the most <b>absurd</b> option they could think of at the time. Much to their surprise, they were booked on the show, and made an appearance.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{explored}} {{the theme of}} escapism at the Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art in a show entitled The Production of Escapism: A Solo Project by Rashid Johnson. He addressed distraction and relief from reality through art and fantasy. Johnson used photos, video and site-specific installation to study escapist tendencies through often {{with a sense of}} humor that bordered on the <b>absurd.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mr. Bean {{often seems}} unaware of basic {{aspects of the}} way the world works, and the {{programme}} usually features his attempts at what would normally be considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, interior decorating, or going to church. The humour largely comes from his original (and often <b>absurd)</b> solutions to problems and his total disregard for others when solving them, his pettiness, and occasional malevolence.|$|E
5|$|The music, {{philosophy}} and lifestyle of heavy metal bands and fans were often panned by both left-wing critics and conservative public opinion, described as senseless, ridiculous {{to the limit}} of self-parody, and even dangerous for the young generation. The 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap addressed many idiosyncrasies of British metal bands, showing comic sides of that world which external observers would judge <b>absurd.</b> Instead metal musicians regarded the movie's content as much too real.|$|E
5|$|Treadgold's {{estimates}} {{are based on}} figures for Constantine's army provided by Zosimus, who is notorious among scholars as an unreliable chronicler, both in general and as regards figures in particular: e.g. he reports that 60,000 Alamanni were killed at the Battle of Strasbourg in 357, an <b>absurd</b> inflation of the 6,000 reported by the contemporary and reliable Ammianus Marcellinus.|$|E
5|$|A major talking {{point at}} the conference was the {{discovery}} by Willis Lamb and his graduate student Robert Retherford shortly before the conference began {{that one of the}} two possible quantum states of hydrogen atoms had slightly more energy than predicted by the Paul Dirac's theory; this became known as the Lamb shift. Oppenheimer and Weisskopf suggested that this was a result of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Pre-war quantum electrodynamics (QED) gave <b>absurd,</b> infinite values for this; but the Lamb shift showed that it was both real and finite. Hans Kramers proposed renormalization as a solution, but no one knew how to do the calculation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{set in a}} hospital, it uses {{no medical}} storylines; the action is {{produced}} {{by a series of}} soap opera-style twists and turns in the personal lives of the characters. They proceed through a series of often <b>absurd</b> sketch-like scenes, or by sequences where the film is slowed down or sped up, often emphasizing the body language of the characters. The show had eight writers. Two series were made by the Talkback Thames production company for Channel 4.|$|E
5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with <b>absurd</b> competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any <b>absurd</b> thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E
5|$|De re militari, a {{treatise}} on Roman military affairs by Vegetius, a late 4th or early 5th-century writer, contains considerable {{information on the}} late army, although its {{focus is on the}} army of the Republic and Principate. However, Vegetius (who wholly lacked military experience) is often unreliable. For example, he stated that the army abandoned armour and helmets in the later 4th century (offering the <b>absurd</b> explanation that this equipment was too heavy), which is contradicted by sculptural and artistic evidence. In general, it is not safe to accept a statement from Vegetius unless it is corroborated by other evidence.|$|E
5|$|He is also {{credited}} with the writing of A Defence of Freemasonry (1765), also known as A Defence of Freemasonry as practised in the regular lodges, both foreign and domestic, under the Constitution of the English Grand Master, in which is contained a refutation of Mr. Dermott's <b>absurd</b> and ridiculous account of Freemasonry, in his book entitled 'Ahiman Rezon' and the several quries therein reflecting on the regular Masons, briefly considered and answered, that response to Laurence Dermott's Ahiman Rezon. Although {{there is no direct}} attribution on the text's titlepage, it was established as his work since its publication, and it includes a poem directly attributed to him.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, in {{correspondence}} of the 70th Anniversary birthday, The Theatre of the <b>Absurd,</b> an Italian independent artists group, {{published a}} short movie {{in honor of}} Syd Barrett named Eclipse, with actor-director Edgar Blake {{in the role of}} Syd. Some footage from this movie was also showed at the Syd Barrett - A Celebration during Men on the Border's tribute: the show took place at the Cambridge Corn Exchange, with the participation of Syd's family and old friends.|$|E
5|$|In Shreveport, meanwhile, {{whatever}} positive momentum {{the team}} had gained {{at the end of}} the 1994 season failed to carry over into 1995. Notable NFL quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver was signed and put up decent numbers; the rest of the team, however, was unable to muster much success and limped to a 5–13 record. As elsewhere, the team saw a second season attendance decline. With the season winding down, the city had clearly soured on the Gliebermans. They became embroiled in legal difficulties and, in one particularly <b>absurd</b> incident, Bernie Glieberman had his lawyer attempt (unsuccessfully) to abscond with a half-million dollar Tucker automobile that Glieberman had donated to a local museum.|$|E
5|$|In a 1983 study, R. J. Kaufmann {{suggests}} that Shaw {{was a key}} forerunner—"godfather, if not actually finicky paterfamilias"—of the Theatre of the <b>Absurd.</b> Two further aspects of Shaw's theatrical legacy are noted by Crawford: his opposition to stage censorship, which was finally ended in 1968, and his efforts which extended over many years to establish a National Theatre. Shaw's short 1910 play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets, in which Shakespeare pleads with Queen Elizabeth I for the endowment of a state theatre, was part of this campaign.|$|E
5|$|Like John Filson, Timothy Flint also interviewed Boone, and his Biographical Memoir of Daniel Boone, the First Settler of Kentucky (1833) {{became one}} of the best-selling biographies of the 19th century. Flint greatly embellished Boone's adventures, doing for Boone what Parson Weems did for George Washington. In Flint's book, Boone fought hand-to-paw with a bear, escaped from Indians by {{swinging}} on vines (as Tarzan would later do), and so on. Although Boone's family thought the book was <b>absurd,</b> Flint greatly influenced the popular conception of Boone, since these tall tales were recycled in countless dime novels and books aimed at young boys.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2009, Randazza {{was interviewed}} {{about the case}} on the WPRR radio program, Declaring Independence. He {{explained}} why Beck did not file a libel lawsuit in the United States. He pointed out that because Beck was a public figure he had to prove a legal standard referred to as actual malice, and show that Eiland-Hall knew his assertions were inaccurate. He explained that this {{did not apply to}} Eiland-Hall's website even if it was knowingly inaccurate, because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell that no proof is needed for an <b>absurd</b> statement made in the context of satire.|$|E
5|$|On the {{one hand}} there are very many people who, if they read any poetry at all, try to take all its {{statements}} seriously – and find them silly... This may seem an <b>absurd</b> mistake but, alas! it is none the less common. On the other hand {{there are those who}} succeed too well, who swallow 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty...,' as the quintessence of an aesthetic philosophy, not as the expression of a certain blend of feelings, and proceed into a complete stalemate of muddle-mindedness {{as a result of their}} linguistic naivety.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} release of the 2017 film Logan, its {{theatrical}} runtime was extended by several minutes. This was due to the addition of a Deadpool short film playing before Logan in place of a traditional post-credits scene. The short was filmed in December 2016 and serves as a tease for the film Deadpool 2, but is not a trailer for that film. It plays into Deadpool's characteristic humor in several ways, being based on an <b>absurd</b> premise that would not work in a feature film, having fourth wall-breaking references to Logan, making fun of the character Superman, and featuring a cameo by Stan Lee in one version.|$|E
5|$|Since then, interpretations in {{successive}} eras {{have reflected}} the sensibilities of the time. Goya {{was seen as}} a proto-Romantic in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on Théodore Géricault, best known for the politically charged Raft of the Medusa (1818–19). Luis Buñuel identified with Goya's sense of the <b>absurd,</b> and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 L'Âge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel.|$|E
5|$|The Daily Mash is a British satirical website {{providing}} parodic {{commentary on}} current affairs and other news stories. Neil Rafferty (a former political correspondent for The Sunday Times) and Paul Stokes (former business editor of The Scotsman), created the website in 2007 and remain the lead writers. Both writers earn salaries from the enterprise and also employ freelance contributors. The publication has garnered praise for its <b>absurd,</b> scatological humour and insightful political satire. The current editor is comedy writer and former BBC journalist Tim Telling. The Daily Mash {{has often been}} compared to the US publication The Onion.|$|E
5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of Riki Naoe, the protagonist of Little Busters!. He is seen as weak due to his girlish {{appearance}} and physical build but is very straightforward and has more common sense than most of his friends. He {{is a member of}} a group of friends called the Little Busters, which originally consisted of four members, but expanded to five with Riki during his childhood. The leader of the Little Busters is Kyousuke Natsume, who is the eldest member. He often comes up with <b>absurd</b> ideas, but almost always follows up with a reasonable explanation along with it.|$|E
5|$|Though {{his career}} spanned the {{desegregation}} and reintegration of the NFL, as an owner, {{he never had}} an African American on any of his teams, but Bert Jr. believed the mere discussion of whether his father was prejudiced was <b>absurd.</b> Bell's handling of the merger with the AAFC was acclaimed as a personal triumph. Although {{he did not have}} the wherewithal to prevent the wholesale betting on games, he was proactive in ensuring games were not tampered with by gamblers, and he created the foundation of the contemporary NFL anti-gambling policy.|$|E
5|$|Viktor Ilyin, a disenfranchised Soviet soldier, {{attempted}} to assassinate Brezhnev on 22 January 1969 by firing shots at a motorcade carrying Brezhnev through Moscow. Though Brezhnev was unhurt, the shots killed a driver and lightly injured several celebrated cosmonauts of the Soviet space programme {{who were also}} travelling in the motorcade. Brezhnev's attacker was captured, and interrogated personally by Andropov, then KGB chairman and future Soviet leader. Ilyin was not given the death penalty because his desire to kill Brezhnev was considered so <b>absurd</b> that {{he was sent to}} the Kazan mental asylum instead for treatment.|$|E
5|$|What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to <b>Absurd</b> Hypothetical Questions is a non-fiction book by Randall Munroe {{in which}} the author answers {{hypothetical}} science questions sent to him by readers of his webcomic, xkcd. The book contains a selection of questions and answers originally published on his blog What If?, along with several new ones. The book is divided into several dozen chapters, {{most of which are}} devoted to answering a unique question. What If? was released in September 2, 2014 and was received positively by critics.|$|E
5|$|A man of {{progressive}} and relatively liberal ideas, Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, {{he had a}} special interest in applying science and art to the manufacturing industry. The Great Exhibition of 1851 arose from the annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert {{served as president of the}} Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and had to fight for every stage of the project. In the House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in Hyde Park. Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy their faith. Albert thought such talk <b>absurd</b> and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.|$|E
5|$|A {{more serious}} crisis {{occurred}} in May, when Dada organized a mock trial of Maurice Barrès, whose early {{affiliation with the}} Symbolists had been shadowed by his antisemitism and reactionary stance: Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes was the prosecutor, Aragon and Soupault the defense attorneys, with Tzara, Ungaretti, Benjamin Péret and others as witnesses (a mannequin stood in for Barrès). Péret immediately upset Picabia and Tzara by refusing to make the trial an <b>absurd</b> one, and by introducing a political subtext with which Breton nevertheless agreed. In June, Tzara and Picabia clashed with each other, after Tzara expressed an opinion that his former mentor was becoming too radical. During the same season, Breton, Arp, Ernst, Maja Kruschek and Tzara were in Austria, at Imst, where they published their last manifesto as a group, Dada au grand air ("Dada in the Open Air") or Der Sängerkrieg in Tirol ("The Battle of the Singers in Tyrol"). Tzara also visited Czechoslovakia, where he reportedly hoped to gain adherents to his cause.|$|E
5|$|According to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, {{the themes}} of {{alienation}} and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading the Kafka work while focusing on the futility of his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, <b>absurd</b> worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer Milan Kundera suggests that Kafka's surrealist humour {{may have been an}} inversion of Dostoyevsky's presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka's work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.|$|E
5|$|After {{breaking}} {{out from his}} prison, Brad falls into a moat before coming {{to a halt in}} a maze of an underground cavern. Reaching the surface, he arrives at a nearby village; this location is repeatedly revisited throughout the game, as Brad comes back there after traveling to the various corners of the land, encountering bizarre characters and experiencing <b>absurd</b> adventures: the Edge of the World cliff, the Ice Palace, and the Valley of the Lost (a place where all kinds of things lost on Earth have gone to), all while searching for an unlikely set of items that would help him emerge victorious from the game's final showdown (including a fire extinguisher and a mechanical fan). In the end, the boy enters the evil Queen's castle to find and defeat her once and for all. Once she is no more, he gets instantly transported back to the baseball field where it all had started.|$|E
5|$|After this {{demonstration}} of power, AJ is promoted by his manager. A montage of AJ being promoted for doing <b>absurd</b> tasks follows. Soon, AJ is promoted to a rank {{with a private}} office. Danny and Morgan refuse to work for AJ further, finding him corrupt with power. AJ throws them out, and afterward he is promoted to CEO by a former officer—a decrepit man within a robotic business suit. AJ floats {{to the top of}} the suit, from which he spots a beach ball-destroying machine to the side. He hallucinates the beach balls as the heads of Morgan and Danny, who say that he has destroyed the spirit of summer. Realizing his mistake, AJ rejects the promotion. He returns to his friends outside, and together they plan the rest of their summer.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to obscure}} the truth about Stanley's affair, Michael starts {{spreading}} a variety of false rumors, among them that there is another person physically inside Kevin (Brian Baumgartner), that Kelly is anorexic, that Toby (Paul Lieberstein) is still a virgin, that Pam (Jenna Fischer) is pregnant, and that Andy (Ed Helms) is gay. When Andy hears about this, he realizes that many people have thought this {{about him in the}} past and gets increasingly insecure as he begins to question his sexual orientation. Jim and Pam, who were trying to keep Pam's pregnancy a secret, think they have been found out. The couple then notice that there have been various <b>absurd</b> rumors about office employees being spread. When Jim brings it to everyone's attention, they trace one particular rumor back to Michael, who then tries to slip out of the office.|$|E
5|$|Imagery {{has always}} been an {{important}} part of the Orb's persona. This is most prominent during live performances, where they often project surreal images against onstage screens. Common images include morphing faces, futuristic cityscapes, and aliens. They have long associated their act with <b>absurd</b> symbology with images such as floating pigs. This has carried over to their music videos, most of which are spacy, brightly coloured montages of surreal images including astronauts, clouds, and neon dolphins. Because of their use of psychedelic images at shows, the Orb's shows are frequently compared to those of Pink Floyd, who also used in-show imagery and films. Paterson cites Godfrey Reggio's and Philip Glass's film Koyaanisqatsi as a primary influence to their concert imagery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the stories}} he narrates, the Baron is shown as a calm, {{rational}} man, describing what he experiences with simple objectivity; <b>absurd</b> happenings elicit, at most, mild surprise from him, and he shows serious doubt about any unlikely events {{he has not}} witnessed himself. The resulting narrative effect is an ironic tone, encouraging skepticism in the reader and marked by a running undercurrent of subtle social satire. In addition to his fearlessness when hunting and fighting, he is suggested to be a debonair, polite gentleman given to moments of , with a scholarly penchant for knowledge, {{a tendency to be}} pedantically accurate about details in his stories, and a deep appreciation for food and drink of all kinds. The Baron also provides a solid geographical and social context for his narratives, peppering them with topical allusions and satire about recent events; indeed, many of the references in Raspe's original text are to historical incidents in the real-life Münchhausen's military career.|$|E
