25|$|In {{the early}} stages of the Second World War, the German {{military}} demonstrated its role as a pioneer in the deployment of airborne operations. These forces had conducted several successful operations during the Battle of France in 1940, including the use of glider-borne troops during the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael. Having been impressed by the performance and capabilities of German airborne operations, the Allied governments decided that they would form their own airborne formations as well. As a result of this decision, the creation of two British airborne divisions came <b>about,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as a number of smaller-scale units. On 22 June 1940, the British airborne establishment was formally initiated when the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office in a memorandum to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops. During 1941, the United States also embarked on a similar programme.|$|E
25|$|The season started <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as {{it could}} have, as the Washington Redskins started the season 6–2, with their two losses coming by a {{combined}} 11 points to the New York Giants and St. Louis Rams. Furthermore, Redskins star Clinton Portis led the NFL in rushing yards and Jason Campbell was just 40 pass attempts away from breaking Bernie Kosar's record of consecutive passes to start the season without an interception. However, things turned for the worse {{on the eve of}} the 2008 Presidential Election, when they were routed 23–6 by the Pittsburgh Steelers and Clinton Portis' injuries finally caught up to him. The Redskins continued to struggle, falling all the way to 7–7, with their only win during that six-week period being a 3-point victory of the then-2–8 Seattle Seahawks, who would finish the season 4-12. The Redskins managed to upset the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 16, but were eliminated from playoff contention after the Atlanta Falcons defeated the Minnesota Vikings 24–17 that same week. The Redskins lost the final game of the season 27–24 to the San Francisco 49ers, despite having a 17–7 lead at halftime, losing on a Joe Nedney field goal as time expired.|$|E

500|$|The journal proved {{influential}} {{from the}} start. Although not initially using {{a process of}} peer review, Crawford asked his friends to read through submissions that he was unsure <b>about.</b> <b>As</b> <b>well</b> as seeking to shape and define the discipline, Antiquity sought to spread news of archaeological discoveries to a wider public, thereby being more accessible than pre-existing scholarly journals. This resulted in Crawford receiving letters from proponents of various pseudo-archaeological ideas, such as the ley line theory of Alfred Watkins; he filed these letters under a section of his archive titled [...] "Crankeries" [...] and was annoyed that educated people believed such ideas when they were demonstrably incorrect. He refused to publish an advert in Antiquity for The Old Straight Track by Watkins, who became very bitter towards him. In 1938, Crawford served as President of the Prehistoric Society; in this position he instigated a series of excavations, inviting the German archaeologist Gerhard Bersu—persecuted in Germany by the Nazi authorities—to move to England to oversee the excavation of Little Woodbury.|$|E
500|$|The Peace dollar was {{released}} into circulation on January 3, 1922. In common with all silver and copper-nickel dollar coins struck from 1840 to 1978, the Peace dollar had {{a diameter of}} , which was larger than the Mint's subsequently struck modern dollar coins. Its issuance completed the redesign of United States coinage that had begun with issues in 1907. Long lines formed at the Sub-Treasury Building in New York the following day when that city's Federal Reserve Bank received a shipment; the 75,000coins initially sent by the Mint were [...] "practically exhausted" [...] {{by the end of}} the day. Rumors that the coins did not stack well were contradicted by bank cashiers, who demonstrated for The New York Times that the coins stacked <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as the Morgan dollars. De Francisci had paid Morgan for 50 of the new dollars; on January 3, Morgan sent him the pieces. According to his wife, de Francisci had bet several people that he would lose the design competition; he used the pieces to pay off the bets and did not keep any.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times Stephen Holden gave a mixed review {{saying the}} film [...] "does a better-than-average job of {{conveying}} the panic and helplessness of men terrorized by a sadist in a degrading environment, {{but it is}} still not especially scary. What sets its demon apart from run-of-the-mill movie serial killers is his impulse to humiliate and torture his victims and justify it with some twisted morality." [...] He said the film is [...] "seriously undermined by the half-baked, formulaic detective story in which the horror is framed." [...] Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times also gave the film a mixed review saying, [...] "Saw is so full of twists it ends up getting snarled. For all of his flashy engineering and inventive torture scenarios, the Jigsaw Killer comes across as an amateur. Hannibal Lecter would have him for lunch." [...] She said the film [...] "carelessly underscores its own shaky narrative at every turn with its mid-budget hokiness." [...] She also noted that Elwes and Whannell had trouble keeping an American accent. Another mixed review came from Roger Ebert, who gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and lamented the gimmicks and plot contrivances but nonetheless described Saw as [...] "well made and acted, and does what it does <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as it could be expected to." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon the album's {{release in}} early April 1962 in both mono and stereo format, a {{reviewer}} for Billboard magazine claimed that [...] "In {{addition to being}} powerful dealer material, this package will fracture knowledgeable jockeys who will find in it a wealth of material to talk <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as play." [...] By mid-April, reports of the album's sales and radio airplay had started coming in from cities such as Dallas and Philadelphia. On June 23, 1962, the mono issue of Modern Sounds replaced the West Side Story soundtrack album as the number one album in the United States, knocking it {{off the top of}} the Billboard Pop Albums chart. The album spawned four charting singles, [...] "Born to Lose", [...] "Careless Love", [...] "I Can't Stop Loving You" [...] and [...] "You Don't Know Me", the latter two of which went number one on the Adult Contemporary chart. The hit singles quickly gained a significant amount of radio airplay on both country and R stations. By mid-May, the album's lead single, [...] "I Can't Stop Loving You", had sold 700,000 copies within its first four weeks of release. Record dealers began describing the album as [...] "equal in sales action to some of the early Presley disks" [...] and, after moving 400,000 copies of the single, influential Atlanta record distributor Gwen Kestler told Billboard magazine that [...] "the record is so hot in her district that people who don't even own record players are buying it." [...] "I Can't Stop Loving You" [...] hit number one on the Billboard Pop Singles chart on June 2, spending five consecutive weeks at the top of the chart. By the time it fell off the top, the single was reported to have reached nearly a million and a half in sales, moving over 100,000 copies per week. In July the record spent two weeks at number one in Great Britain.|$|E
