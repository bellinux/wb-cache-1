During the immediate postwar years, the British proposed that Eritrea be divided along religious lines and parceled off to Sudan and Ethiopia. The Soviet Union, anticipating an Italian Communist Party victory in the Italian polls, initially supported returning Eritrea to Italy under trusteeship or as a colony. Soviet diplomats, led by Maxim Litvinov and backed by Ivan Maisky and Vyacheslav Molotov, even attempted to have Eritrea become a trustee of the Soviet Union itself.|$|E

5000|$|In inland waters, {{sovereignty}} {{of the state is}} equal to that which it exercises on the mainland. The coastal state is free to make laws relating to its internal waters, regulate any use, and use any resource. In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreements</b> to the contrary, foreign vessels have no right of passage within internal waters, and this lack of right to innocent passage is the key difference between internal waters and territorial waters. The [...] "archipelagic waters" [...] within the outermost islands of archipelagic states are treated as internal waters with the exception that innocent passage must be allowed, although the archipelagic state may designate certain sea lanes in these waters.|$|R

30|$|Game-theoretic {{methods can}} be {{employed}} to optimize energy consumption of users because they can capture the features of interactions among users. Games {{can be divided into}} cooperative games and non-cooperative games according to the presence or <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreements</b> among the players. Generally, players in the cooperative game aim to minimize/maximize the total group cost/profit of all players and then search the overall optimal solution for each player by solving the optimization problem; while in the non-cooperative game, players only aim to minimize/maximize their own cost/profit and then search the Nash equilibrium. In this paper, considering the selfishness of human beings and that each user is only concerned about his/her cost, we formulate the model via a non-cooperative game.|$|R

5000|$|Kerr {{points out}} that the {{formulation}} of the application in Sweets from Heaven clearly indicates that the applicants meant to differ between tacit and implied terms.

The obligation to provide the lessee with commodus usus is one such term; therefore, where the parties do not explicitly include a term in the contract which excludes this obligation, it will be implied by law.|$|E
