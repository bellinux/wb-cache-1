2500|$|As Queen Elizabeth was displeased by {{the fall}} of the Ruthven Regime, Walsingham was sent as {{ambassador}} to Scotland in September 1583. He spoke to James VI at Perth, and was convinced that Queen Mary's influence was dominant in Scotland, and working to the young king's confusion. He wrote to Elizabeth that Mary, [...] "though she cannot live many years" [...] would see his overthrow. James VI had not enjoyed the Ruthven government. Walsingham found the King unable to take his complaints seriously, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> at Walsingham, [...] "falling into a distemperture", telling him that he was an [...] "absolute King" [...] and would order his subjects as he would [...] "best lyke himself." [...] James was 17, Mary was 40.|$|E
2500|$|McCarver {{was also}} known to make gaffes {{from time to}} time. One of his more amusing miscues came during the 1992 National League Championship Series when he {{repeatedly}} referred to Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Tim Wakefield as [...] "Bill Wakefield." [...] He finally explained that Bill Wakefield {{was one of his}} old minor-league teammates, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> at himself because [...] "I forgot my own name!" [...] The year prior, during Game 6 of the World Series, McCarver's broadcast colleague, Jack Buck talked about Atlanta third baseman Terry Pendleton, who hit [...]367 in the series. Buck said, [...] "TP. That's what his teammates call him." [...] A few seconds later, McCarver rather oddly added, [...] "TP. An appropriate name for someone who plays on the Braves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Atto was {{captured}} by Task Force Ranger on September 21, 1993, from a location near Digfer Hospital. The Rangers had made an earlier attempt at Atto's capture, but missed him by seconds. In a speech at a church in Daytona, in January 2002, William Boykin, responsible for the operation, recounted, [...] "There {{was a man in}} Mogadishu named Osman Atto... He went on CNN <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> at us, and he said, 'They'll never get me because Allah will protect me.'" [...] The arrest was later portrayed in the 2001 film Black Hawk Down. In an interview with the BBC, Atto indicated that many aspects of the movie are factually incorrect. He took exception with the ostentatious character chosen to portray him; Atto does not look like the actor who portrayed him, smoke cigars, or wear earrings, facts which were later confirmed by SEAL Team Six sniper Howard E. Wasdin in his 2012 memoirs. Wasdin also indicated that while the character in the movie ridiculed his captors, Atto in reality seemed concerned that Wasdin and his men had been sent to kill rather than apprehend him. Atto additionally stated that he was not consulted about the project or approached for permission, and that the film sequence re-enacting his arrest contained several inaccuracies: [...] "First of all when I was caught on 21 September, I was only travelling with one Fiat 124, not three vehicles as it shows in the film... And when the helicopter attacked, people were hurt, people were killed... The car we were travelling in, and I have got proof, it was hit at least 50 times. And my colleague Ahmed Ali was injured on both legs... I think it was not right, the way they portrayed both the individual and the action. It was not right.|$|E
