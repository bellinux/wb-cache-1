50|$|The stem {{serves as}} a {{connector}} from the actuator {{to the inside of}} the valve and transmits this actuation force. Stems are either smooth for <b>actuator</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>valves</b> or threaded for manual valves. The smooth stems are surrounded by packing material to prevent leaking material from the valve. This packing is a wearable material and will have to be replaced during maintenance. With a smooth stem the ends are threaded to allow connection to the plug and the actuator. The stem must not only withstand a large amount of compression force during valve closure, but also have high tensile strength during valve opening. In addition, the stem must be very straight, or have low run out, in order to ensure good valve closure. This minimum run out also minimizes wear of the packing contained in the bonnet, which provides the seal against leakage. The stem may be provided with a shroud over the packing nut to prevent foreign bodies entering the packing material, which would accelerate wear.|$|R

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of performances of electric <b>actuators</b> for <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> in industrial <b>control</b> loops. The objective of the recent collaboration between University of Pisa and CLUI AS is to assess potentials and benefits of <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> electric <b>actuators,</b> by testing and comparing devices of different typologies and manufacturers. As a premise, {{it should be noted}} that pneumatic actuators still represent the most commonly used actuation devices in the process industry, mainly because of high performance and fast response. In recent years, electric actuators, as a result of their enhanced features, are finding increasing applications in the area of process control. Anyway, some practical aspects, such as the degradation of the valve seat, an excessive tightening of the seal, and an expansion of metallic components due to high temperature operation, can cause malfunctions, and in particular, phenomena of wear and friction within a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> regardless of the type of actuator. In fact, pneumatic and electric valves differ only in the actuation system; while the valve body, subject to most of the friction forces, is absolutely the same. In detail, the present work has been focused on the analysis of a recent electric actuator installed on an rotary <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> and tested in the last biennium in an pilot plant, owned by ENEL in Livorno (Italy). Specific experimental tests were carried out, by collecting operating data in open-loop and closed-loop mode. The validity and effectiveness of the performance was verified in nominal and faulty conditions, in particular, by introducing a dead-band. Furthermore, performances of this electric actuator was compared with that of a conventional pneumatic actuator with positioner, coupled to the same valve, installed on the same plant line, and tested in equivalent experimental conditions. In general terms, it has been confirmed that the electric <b>actuator</b> for <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is a promising technology, and its performance are fully comparable - if not superior - to those of the pneumatic actuator.

Therefore, in our previous study, we developed a small and light-weight quasi-servo valve to reduce the burden of the user. In this paper, we proposed and tested a quasi-servo valve by using the small, light-weight and low-cost on/off valves driven by the pulse width modulation method. The valve consists of two on/off valves and a microcomputer. Both valves are connected in serial. One valve is used as a switching valve to exhaust or supply, and another is used as a PWM <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> that can adjust the valve opening. And we confirmed that the output flow rate of the tested valve could be adjusted in analog way. We also proposed the precise analytical model of the tested valve.

In the next step, a pressure <b>control</b> type quasi-servo <b>valve</b> is proposed and tested.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates a novel {{method for}} energy saving in a point-to-point actuation of a pneumatic system. The method predicts the system's actuation using the Gas Law and the actuator model, and commits air supply cut-off {{at the time}} when the energy in the actuator is sufficient to complete the actuation task. Experimental implementation is compared with simulation. The effect of the method is compared with conventional no cut-off and end-stroke cut-off actuations. Lumped and finite difference methods are used for transmission line and system actuation modelling. The transmission line, <b>actuator</b> and <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> are modelled and integrated for the system actuation simulation and comparisons between simulation and measured data are performed. Pressure oscillation in the transmission line exists and is captured by stimulating the air dynamics using a new transmission line experimental method. The friction model of the pneumatic actuator is determined by experiment and applied to the energy saving control system as well as the computer modelling algorithm. The determination of pneumatic transmission line bulk modulus is performed through experiment due to the confidentiality of Young's modulus value needed for its calculation. Significant effect has been achieved in implementation and it is found that cut off at end-stroke and cut-off using model prediction can reduce the amount of air potential energy wasted in conventional actuation by up to 43. 5 % and 80. 2 % respectively.

40|$|Increasing {{regulation}} {{on emissions}} {{and a general}} trend towards more environmentally friendly solutions has motivated the researchers {{to look for ways}} to make mobile machinery more efficient. Excavators particularly are a remarkable source of pollution due to the vast amount and the low efficiency of these machines. Excavators are ordinarily equipped with conventional, centralized hydraulic system, where main pump supplies volumetric flow for the whole system. This flow is directed from the pump to <b>actuators</b> through <b>control</b> <b>valves,</b> and the returning flow is directed into the tank. Conventional hydraulic system has numerous disadvantages. Many supportive functions are required, including pressure control and load-sensing functions. Even on idle mode, there are flow losses due to continuous circulation of fluid through valves. In addition, the distance between pumps and actuators may be long, which causes pressure loss and an additional weight of long hoses filled with fluid. One proposed improvement is the use of displacement-controlled hydraulics, in which the <b>actuator</b> <b>control</b> is realized by sophisticated pump control, instead of metering the flow in directional valves. In this work, the efficiency of a modified JCB micro excavator is studied. Excavator is fitted with pressure and position sensors, and the simulation model is verified with laboratory measurements. The literature on the topic is reviewed to find the best practises concerning the studies on mobile machinery efficiency, including standardized duty cycles. The hydraulic system of the excavator is modelled in Matlab Simulink, and the simulation model is utilized to calculate the power consumption of the excavator during a digging and loading and a levelling cycle. Further simulation study is produced by replacing the conventional hydraulic system with displacement-controlled units, namely direct-driven hydraulics, or DDH’s. The same duty cycles are performed with both systems, and the results are presented. The study shows a power loss of as much as 60 % in the directional valve group.
