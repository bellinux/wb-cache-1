40|$|Vehicle mass is {{a crucial}} factor for the {{distribution}} of injuries between occupants in involved vehicles in a two-vehicle crash. A larger vehicle mass protects the occupants in the vehicle while on the same time inflicts a higher injury risk on the occupants in the collision partner. This mass externality can be internalized to reach {{a situation where the}} drivers choose vehicle mass based on the social optimum instead of a private optimum that ignores the negative effects that a large vehicle mass has on the injury risk in presumptive collision partners. Using a database including collision accidents in Sweden involving two passenger cars during five years, the influence of vehicle mass on the injuries and thereby the <b>accident</b> <b>cost</b> in both vehicles is explored. The database contains information on road infrastructure, vehicle characteristics including vehicle mass and characteristics of the occupants in the vehicles including their injuries. To get a measure of the <b>accident</b> <b>cost</b> the Swedish official economic valuation of slight injuries, severe injuries and fatalities are applied. In each accident the two involved vehicles are divided into the lighter vehicle and the heavier vehicle and the effect of weight is examined separately for the two groups. The <b>accident</b> <b>cost</b> that falls on the lighter vehicle increases with the mass of the heavier vehicle and decreases with own mass. Given that a vehicle is the heavier one in the crash, neither the own mass nor the mass of the lighter vehicle significantly affect the <b>accident</b> <b>cost.</b> The expected external <b>accident</b> <b>cost</b> is calculated and it is shown to increase rapidly with vehicle mass. The paper discusses different solutions to internalize this external <b>accident</b> <b>cost</b> and calculates a mass dependent multiplicative tax on the insurance premium in a no-fault insurance system.

40|$|This article {{shows that}} extant rights-based {{theories}} of accident law contain a gaping hole. They inadequately address the following question: What justifies using community standards to assign <b>accident</b> <b>costs</b> in tort law? In the United States, the jury determines negligence for accidental harm by asking whether the defendant met the objective reasonable person standard. However, what determines {{the content of}} the reasonable person standard is enigmatic. Some tort theorists say that the content is filled out by juries using cost benefit analysis while others say that juries apply community norms and conventions. I demonstrate that what is missing from this exchange is a theory that adequately justifies using a particular way of filling out {{the content of the}} objective reasonable person standard. Rights-based theories are particularly guilty of ignoring what I call the central normative concern. That concern is what criterion should determine the amount of precaution an individual must use to avoid being justifiably assigned others’ <b>accident</b> <b>costs.</b> To identify this problem I focus on rights-based theories of accident law. After showing how several rights-based theories of accident law inadequately address the central normative concern, I briefly outline a theory of assigning <b>accident</b> <b>costs</b> that has the potential for offering the best answer to the central normative concern. The most important aspect of this theory, called democratic community standard theory, is that it provides a justification for using community standards to adjudicate tort claims.

As a result, highway designers have commonly used three safety treatments to protect errant motorists from striking culvert openings. These safety treatments have included: culvert extension, guardrail installation, and the application of safety grating. However, the identification of the most appropriate safety treatment for roadside culverts may be challenging; <b>accident</b> <b>costs</b> may dramatically change under different road and traffic characteristics. The {{purpose of this study was}} to estimate <b>accident</b> <b>costs</b> for a wide range of road and traffic scenarios and then define the safest treatment (i. e., treatment with lowest accident cost) for a variety of traffic, roadway, and roadside characteristics. Over 3, 000 highway scenarios were modeled using the Roadside Safety Analysis Program (RSAP). This study showed that the selection of culvert safety treatments should be flexible when considering different road and traffic characteristics. The findings demonstrated that culvert extension and grating were found to produce the lowest <b>accident</b> <b>costs</b> for all highway scenarios that were modeled, and guardrail protection was not recommended for any of the scenarios. Therefore, it is believed that the expanded adoption of culvert extension and culvert grates can improve overall highway safety...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{innovative}} study where {{for the first}} time in Singapore <b>accident</b> <b>costs</b> have been derived using a willingness-to-pay (WTP) approach. In order to carry out evaluations of road safety projects and transport infrastructure investments, it is necessary to use a true value of accident cost that would reflect the community willingness to pay. Singapore has been using the traditional human capital approach, which derives a valuation of fatalities based on the discounted value of future income of an average fatal traffic accident victim. Over the last two decades, a number of countries have derived values of accident cost based on a WTP approach by applying Contingent Valuation (CV) methods. Recently, researchers in Chile and the Netherlands have pioneered the use of Stated Preference (SP) methods to derive the WTP values of statistical life and severe injury. Our work built upon this and provided the WTP value of <b>accident</b> <b>costs</b> in Singapore. This paper describes the survey, which involved more than 4, 000 interviews of Singaporean residents, and included both CV and SP methods to derive <b>accident</b> <b>costs</b> in the context of urban travel. The CV and SP results were then compared. Finally, the WTP values were compared against those obtained from using the human capital valuation method, and also against other WTP accident cost values from other developed countries. 1...|$|E

A double principle-agent model is developed to analyze optimal safety regulation when accident risks are affected by decisions made by the firm as well as the firm’s employees (workers). The regulator perfectly observes the safety investments of the firm, but can not observe worker safety decisions, while the firm imperfectly observes the worker safety decisions. It is shown, in the case of no regulation, that the first-best is unattainable unless third-party <b>accident</b> <b>costs</b> are absent and the firm uses performance payments. The optimal regulatory standard produces a sub-optimal solution and is shown to depend on safety effort costs, the accident technology, the distribution of <b>accident</b> <b>costs</b> across firms, workers and third-parties, and the firm’s ability to observe worker safety efforts...|$|E
