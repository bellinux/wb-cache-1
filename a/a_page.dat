40|$|To {{calculate}} {{the capacity of}} <b>a</b> <b>paging</b> system two different models can be applied: a theoretical and a simulation model. This paper presents factors that affect the capacity of <b>a</b> <b>paging</b> system, shows how the capacity can be calculated by use of mentioned models and compares obtained results. The simulation process is described and impact of different queuing algorithms on system capacity is presented. The paper discusses also the relationship between models and shows that the capacity of <b>a</b> <b>paging</b> system can be determined by use of a theoretical model only if a simulation model has been applied before. INTRODUCTION The capacity of <b>a</b> <b>paging</b> system is influenced by many different factors (Ball et al. 1985). These factors can be classified and divided on three different levels: physical, transport and presentation level. The factors on the physical level affect and reduce the time that is available for the transmission of paging messages. These factors are wide-area coverage techniques (t [...] ...|$|R
5|$|After {{traveling}} through {{a network of}} caves and a dormant volcano, the team reaches the borders of Atlantis. They are greeted by Kida who resembles a young woman and discover that the Atlantean language {{is the basis of}} many existing languages. Kida enlists Milo's aid in deciphering the Atlantean written language, long forgotten by the natives. By swimming deep within the city's submerged ruins and translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover the nature of the Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn around their necks. He is surprised this is not mentioned in the journal but recalls that <b>a</b> <b>page</b> is missing.|$|E

Truman worked as <b>a</b> <b>page</b> at the 1900 Democratic National Convention at Convention Hall in Kansas City; his father had many friends who were active in the Democratic Party and helped young Harry to gain his first political position.|$|E
5|$|At night, Evelyn {{takes the}} Book of the Dead and reads <b>a</b> <b>page</b> aloud, accidentally {{awakening}} Imhotep. The expeditions return to Cairo, but Imhotep follows {{them with the}} help of Beni. Imhotep returns to full strength by killing the Americans one by one, and brings the ten plagues back to Egypt. Seeking a way to stop Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum. Ardeth hypothesizes that Imhotep wants to resurrect Anck-su-Namun again and plans to do so by sacrificing Evelyn. Evelyn believes that if the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of the Living can kill him again, and deduces the book's whereabouts. Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves. Evelyn agrees to accompany Imhotep if he spares the rest of the group.|$|E

Two years later, he became principal of Bardstown public schools, serving from 1888 to 1893. Concurrently, he studied law at the University of Kentucky, where he earned his law degree in 1889. He was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice in Bardstown in 1893. He also {{served as president of the}} Young Democrats' Club of Nelson County.|$|E
5|$|Boxwood {{cut across}} the end-grain is hard enough for fine engraving, {{allowing}} greater detail than in normal woodcutting. This been the dominant method used since Bewick's time. In addition, since a wood engraving is inked on the face, it requires only low pressure to print an image, so the blocks last for many thousands of prints, and importantly can be assembled into <b>a</b> <b>page</b> of metal type for ordinary printing in a single run. In contrast, a copper plate engraving is inked in the engraved grooves, the face being wiped clean of ink before printing, so much higher pressure is required, and images must be printed separately from the text, at far greater expense.|$|E
5|$|By 1940, the {{collections}} {{at the library}} had increased to total of about 130,000 and 1,400 serials.

At that time the building was open from 7:50 am until 10 pm on weekdays, and 2 pm to 5 pm on Sundays. Construction on the new wing of the library started in 1940 and was designed by John V. Bennes, the same architect who designed the original structure. He also designed a matching wing {{for the other side}} as well, but that wing was never added.|$|E

This arrangement was contingent on Bradley's being judged competent by two circuit judges. Despite having no college education, Bradley passed the exam and was licensed in 1865, joining his father's firm in Lancaster. He later received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Kentucky University (now Transylvania University).|$|E
