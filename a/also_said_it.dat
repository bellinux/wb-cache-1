5|$|Denise Wong, the Calgarian {{actor who}} portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, {{said that the}} play was about the human condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama calls {{attention to the fact that}} poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that the play will put a face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play and said that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He <b>also</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.|$|E
