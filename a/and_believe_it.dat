5|$|First Strike {{takes place}} in the 26th century, where humanity, under the {{governance}} of the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), has been fighting a losing war against a religious collective of alien races known as the Covenant. Humanity's best defense against the Covenant is the SPARTAN Project, super-soldiers in powered armor, but these elite troops are too few to turn the tide of war in the UNSC's favor. Following a Covenant attack on Reach, a planet within UNSC jurisdiction, the Pillar of Autumn flees randomly coming across an ancient installation built by the mysterious Forerunner. The Covenant call this relic Halo, <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is a weapon and means of transcendence. UNSC discover that Halo is in fact a method of containing a parasite known as the Flood, by destroying all sentient life to prevent the Flood from spreading beyond Halo. The SPARTAN Master Chief and his artificial intelligence companion, Cortana, detonate the Pillar of Autumns engines, destroying Halo. Escaping the destruction via a fighter, the Chief and Cortana believe themselves the only survivors of the catastrophe.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back at Parkside {{the other}} seven trains {{had come to a}} halt {{following}} the accident. The electrical telegraph had not yet been invented and no signalling system was in place advanced enough to communicate with Northumbrian, with Liverpool and Manchester, or with the party who had accompanied Huskisson to Eccles. The remaining passengers and railway staff congregated near the accident site to discuss how best to proceed. The L staff argued that since the railway was not at fault for the accident they should be allowed to continue to Manchester to prove the viability of the design. They also made the point that a large crowd would by now have gathered in Manchester, waiting to see the arrival of the trains and {{to get a glimpse of}} the Duke of Wellington. Joseph Sandars also suggested that, did the group not continue, the Manchester crowd would hear rumours of the accident <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> to be more serious than it was. The Prime Minister and Sir Robert Peel, the Home Secretary, felt that it would be disrespectful to Huskisson to continue, and advocated that the group return to Liverpool to await news of Huskisson's condition.|$|E

25|$|Description: This {{paper is}} written in support of Moore and Robinson’s {{previous}} interpretation that, {{in regards to the}} spermatogenesis of Periplanata americana, the nucleolus of the first spermatocyte is the homologue of one or two spermatogonial chromosomes. They attribute the elongate form to mechanical influences <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> to usually have a spherical shape like the nucleolus. In place of Periplanata americana, Foot and Strobell studied the spermatogenesis of Anasa tristis. The original paper asserts that Anasa tristis has 22 chromosomes, but they confirmed Paulmier and Montgomery’s assessment that Anasa tristis has 21 chromosomes after the paper was sent to press.|$|E
25|$|Those who breed Tollers for {{conformation}} shows {{consider the}} head (clean cut, slightly wedge-shaped) {{to be an}} important feature, <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> should resemble that of a fox, and must never be blocky like that of a Golden Retriever. The ears are triangular and set high and well back from the skull. The pigment on a toller's nose, lips and eye rims should match, and should be either black (which normally fades with age) or liver, blending into the coat. Lips fit fairly tightly around the mouth. The correct bite is a scissor bite, full dentition is required. Jaws are strong enough to carry a large bird, but Tollers must have a soft mouth too. Eyes are set well apart, almond shaped, medium-sized. Colour, amber to dark brown. Expression is friendly, alert and intelligent.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, the University of Birmingham {{disclosed}} that scientific tests may show a Quran manuscript in its collection {{as one of}} the oldest known <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> was written close to the time of Muhammad. Dr Saud al-Sarhan, Director of Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh, questions whether the parchment might have been reused as a palimpsest, and also noted that the writing had chapter separators and dotted verse endings – features in Arabic scripts which are believed not to have been introduced to the Qur'an until later. Dr Saud's criticisms was affirmed by several Saudi-based experts in Quranic history, who strongly rebut any speculation that the Birmingham/Paris Quran could have been written during the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad. They emphasize that while Muhammad was alive, Quranic texts were written without chapter decoration, marked verse endings or use of coloured inks; and did not follow any standard sequence of surahs. They maintain that those features were introduced into Quranic practice in the time of the Caliph Uthman, and so the Birmingham leaves could have been written later, but not earlier.|$|E

500|$|Qs Mat Snow called Achtung Baby U2's [...] "heaviest {{album to}} date. And best." [...] Snow praised {{the band and}} its {{production}} team for making [...] "music of drama, depth, intensity <b>and,</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> funkiness". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune felt the record [...] "shows the band in a grittier light: disrupting, rather than fulfilling, expectations". He praised Lanois' production and said that due to the Edge's guitar playing, [...] "U2 sounds punkier than it has since its 1980 debut, Boy". Kot concluded his review by calling the album [...] "a magnificent search for transcendence {{made all the more}} moving for its flaws". Niall Stokes of Hot Press wrote, [...] "Ostensibly decadent, sensual and dark, it is a record of, and for, these times." [...] The New Zealand Herald found it [...] "pretty damn good" [...] and its sound [...] "subdued, tightly controlled, [...] introverted". However, it said that too many [...] "downbeat moments where songs seem to be going nowhere" [...] prevented it from being a [...] "truly wondrous affair". In Spin, Jim Greer was more critical of the album, calling it an [...] "ambitious failure"; the review welcomed its experimentation but judged that when the group [...] "strays from familiar territory, the results are hit-and-miss". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau rated it a dud, and in 1994, he reflected on this sentiment: [...] "After many, many tries, Achtung Baby still sounded like a damnably diffuse U2 album to me, and I put it in the hall unable to describe a single song." [...] In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the band's musical transformation as [...] "thorough", [...] "effective", and [...] "endlessly inventive". Erlewine concluded that few artists at that stage in their career could have [...] "recorded an album as adventurous or fulfilled their ambitions quite as successfully as U2 [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|As {{part of the}} Delivering Quality First {{proposals}} {{submitted by}} the BBC in October 2011 {{and approved by the}} BBC Trust in May 2012, all children's programming on BBC One and Two would be moved permanently to the CBBC and CBeebies channels following the digital switchover. It was found that the majority of child viewers watched the programmes on these channels already and that only 7% of these children watched CBBC programmes on BBC One and Two only, it was made clear [...] "Children's programmes are absolutely fundamental to the BBC and that is why we have protected investment in them in the light of cuts elsewhere." [...] Children's programming on BBC One ended on 21 December 2012. The move was criticised by Teletubbies co-creator Anne Wood, who described the changes as [...] "ghettoising children's programmes" [...] <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> was merely a cost-cutting measure. Wood said [...] "On the one hand it is inevitable. But it is dismissive of children. There {{is a certain amount of}} overlooking of the fact that children's programmes do get a wider audience than people are aware of... I have frequently had letters from older people who have enjoyed my programmes as much as children do. A lot of the reason older people like to watch children's programming is because it is life-enhancing." [...] Head of BBC Children's, Joe Godwin said: [...] "Our young viewers are our priority and the vast majority of children in the UK already tune in to CBeebies and CBBC to find their favourite BBC children's programmes. Far from being a 'cynical' move, we're just following where our audience has already gone." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{some time}} the Duke {{and his colleagues}} {{had been looking for}} a way out of their difficulty, by which they could save themselves, satisfy public clamor and yet avoid {{responsibility}} before history. Bazaine stated in his defence [...] "I have graven on my chest two words - Honneur et Patrie. They have guided me for the whole of my military career. I have never failed that noble motto, no more at Metz than anywhere else during the forty-two years that I have loyally served France. I swear it here, before Christ". Despite a vigorous defence of Bazaine's actions by Lachaud, and the presentation of a number of strong witness statements from his staff including Colonel Willette, the court found Bazaine guilty of negotiating with and capitulating to the enemy before doing all that was prescribed by duty and honour. It was clear even to the most partial observer, that the verdict bore very little relation to the evidence. For example, the Marshal surrendered only after receiving letters recommending him to do so from his generals, but the presentation of these at the trial was ignored. [...] "I have read every word of the evidence [...] <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> to be the most malicious casuistry" [...] (New York Times correspondent). A letter which Prince Frederick Charles wrote in Bazaine's favour only added to the wrath of the people, who cried aloud for his execution. The court sentenced Bazaine to 'degradation and death', and to pay the costs of the enormous trial (300,000 francs), which was to leave the Marshal's young family penniless. [...] Bazaine's reaction on being read the sentence of the court was [...] "It is my life you want, take it at once, let me be shot immediately, but preserve my family". Since the Revolution, only two French Marshals have been condemned to death — Ney, by a Bourbon, and Bazaine, by an Orléans. But, as though the judges themselves felt a twinge of conscience at the sentence, they immediately and unanimously signed a petition for 'Executive Clemency' to the President of the Third Republic, Marshal MacMahon, although Bazaine refused to sign this petition himself.|$|E
