5|$|Following {{the demise}} of the Pandya kingdom in the 14th century, Kumbakonam was conquered by the Vijayanagar Empire. Krishnadevaraya (1509–29), the emperor of Vijayanagara visited the town in 1524 and is {{believed}} to have bathed in the famous Mahamaham tank during the Mahamaham festival. Kumbakonam was ruled by the Madurai Nayaks and the Thanjavur Nayaks from 1535 to 1673 when it fell to the Marathas. Each of these foreign dynasties had a considerable impact on the demographics and culture of the region. When the Vijayanagar Empire fell in 1565, there was a mass influx of poets, musicians and cultural <b>artists</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In 1499 the Duchy of Milan was conquered by the French, {{causing a}} {{diaspora}} of <b>artists</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city {{to all of}} northern Italy and beyond. Perhaps {{this is the reason}} for the return of Tamagnino to Brescia. A tantalising project was the commission of the Palazzo della Loggia, in which he participated between November 1499 and June 1500. Sculptural works that had begun at the Loggia in 1492, when Tamagnino had left Brescia, were now the hegemony of Gasparo Cairano, for some years considered as a court sculptor by the Brescian grandees, both public and private.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{dedicated}} to exhibiting {{the work of}} <b>artists</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> West of England, under the directorship of Barry Barker (1986–1991) the gallery moved towards a more general spread of contemporary art. Barker supervised a successful refurbishment of the gallery spaces and café bar by David Chipperfield. Before development work began, the Arnolfini was attracting over 285,000 visitors per year. Subsequent Directors have been Tessa Jackson (1991–1999), Caroline Collier (1999–2005) and Tom Trevor (2005-2013).|$|E

A two-story building with a triangular plan, the cultural centers performs three main functions: a meeting place for large gatherings during annual festivals, a place to stage exhibitions, and a library. The French Cultural Center {{is a symbol of}} French partnership and cooperation in Gaza. It holds art exhibits, concerts, film screenings, and other activities.

5|$|The Stuckists Punk Victorian was {{the first}} {{national}} gallery exhibition of Stuckist art. It {{was held at the}} Walker Art Gallery and Lady Lever Art Gallery and was part of the 2004 Liverpool Biennial. It consisted of over 250 paintings by 37 artists, mostly from the UK but also with a representation of international Stuckist <b>artists</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> US, Germany and Australia. There was an accompanying exhibition of Stuckist photographers. A book, The Stuckists Punk Victorian, was published to accompany the exhibition. Daily Mail journalist Jane Kelly exhibited a painting of Myra Hindley in the show, which may have been the cause of her dismissal from her job.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{also home}} to a number of {{commercial}} and public art galleries; including the newly expanded Whitechapel Gallery. The artists Gilbert and George have long made their home and workshop in Spitalfields, and the neighbourhood around Hoxton Square has become a centre for modern British art, including the White Cube gallery, with many <b>artists</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Young British Artists movement living and working in the area. This has made the area around Hoxton and Shoreditch fashionable, with many former residents now driven out by higher property prices, and a busy nightlife has developed, with over 80 licensed premises around Shoreditch.|$|E

5|$|Three-dimensional space can be {{represented}} convincingly in art, as in technical drawing, by means other than perspective. Oblique projections, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese <b>artists</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first or second centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome. Oblique projection is seen in Japanese art, {{such as in the}} Ukiyo-e paintings of Torii Kiyonaga (1752–1815).|$|E
5|$|West got his {{big break}} in the year 2000, {{when he began to}} produce for artists on Roc-A-Fella Records. West came to achieve {{recognition}} and is often credited with revitalizing Jay-Z's career with his contributions to the rap mogul's influential 2001 album The Blueprint. The Blueprint is consistently ranked among the greatest hip-hop albums, and the critical and financial success of the album generated substantial interest in West as a producer. Serving as an in-house producer for Roc-A-Fella Records, West produced records for other <b>artists</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> label, including Beanie Sigel, Freeway, and Cam'ron. He also crafted hit songs for Ludacris, Alicia Keys, and Janet Jackson.|$|E

The invitation cards for the launch had 3D holographic designs which won the Sappi awards of the year 2009. Aishwarya Rai and Deepika Padukone were initially considered for the female lead roles, before Miss India 2009 Pooja Chopra and Divya Parameshwaran accepted the roles. The producers initially listed Sathyaraj in its cast, later replaced by Prabhu. Approximately 5000 junior artists and 1000 <b>artists</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> annual Chennai Sangamam had reportedly taken part in the film. For music, Thiagarajan approached A. R. Rahman in 2008 who declined the offer, and Ilaiyaraaja eventually replaced him. Muthuraj was selected as the art director for the film and Shaji Kumar as cinematographer while Prashanth took care of visual effects.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th {{century the}} reach and {{influence}} of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries' merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy. The early to mid-century saw great rises in international trade and domestic wealth, leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art. <b>Artists</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> area attracted patronage from the Baltic coast, the north German and Polish regions, the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland. At first, masters had acted as their own dealers, attending fairs where they could also buy frames, panels and pigments. The mid-century saw the development of art dealership as a profession; the activity became purely commercially driven, dominated by the mercantile class.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Australia marked 200 {{years since}} its first {{official}} white settlement, established by Captain Arthur Phillip on Sydney Harbour in 1788. While some Indigenous Australians protested the event, {{and referred to}} the occasion as Invasion Day rather than Australia Day, a group of Indigenous artists from Ramingining in the Northern Territory decided to create an artwork to mark the anniversary. The project was initiated by Djon Mundine, an Indigenous art advisor and curator, who was working at Ramingining prior to the Bicentenary. A small group of artists including David Malangi, Paddy Dhathangu, George Milpurrurru and Jimmy Wululu decided {{the form of the}} project, but ultimately 43 <b>artists</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> region contributed pieces to the Memorial.|$|E
