2500|$|After Challenger, Greene {{chose to}} retire as a flight director. In October 1987, {{after a short}} period working with a study group on lunar exploration, he was {{appointed}} head of NASA's safety division. The division had been created after the Challenger accident at {{the recommendation of the}} Rogers Commission, which saw its establishment as key in creating a new, more vigorous [...] "safety culture" [...] at NASA. However, Greene feared that too much introspection by NASA engineers could lead to a damaging loss of confidence. In an interview a year later, he said that NASA had been on [...] "a fantastic guilt trip," [...] adding that [...] "I believe NASA has been overly eager to defend itself against all critics. <b>Any</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> an independent panel, you {{ought to be able to}} name a defense attorney for the status quo." ...|$|E

"In {{answer to}} your letter, I would <b>have</b> <b>you</b> know that as my noble father (whose cruel death must be inquired of and avenged) bade me with his last words, I, fearing that a like fate would {{overtake}} me {{at the hands of}} his murderers, did, as you suppose, seek refuge at this house. Here, yesterday, I was married in the face of God and man in the church of Cranwell, as you may learn from the paper sent herewith. It is not, therefore, needful that you should seek a husband for me, since my dear lord, Sir Christopher Harflete, and I are one till death do part us.

6000|$|... "Friends," [...] he said, [...] "we London merchants are {{accustomed}} to express our gratitude not only by words but by deeds. At present, methinks, seeing that, as you have told me, you have not yet launched out into the world, there is naught that you need; but {{this may not be}} so always, for none can tell what fortune may befall him. I only say that any service I can possibly render you at <b>any</b> <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> but to ask me. I am a rich man, and, having no son, my daughter is my only heir. Had your estate been different and your taste turned towards trade, I could have put you in the way of becoming like myself, foreign merchants; but even in your own profession of arms I may be of assistance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} press {{you to do}} so," [...] Titus said; [...] "though Josephus, here, {{will tell you that}} Rome is not an unkind lord, even to those who have most {{withstood}} it. When you are well enough to leave us, you shall go unharmed; though, could you have seen your way to desist from hostility to us, I would have been a good friend to you; and have promoted you to posts of honor, and that in countries where you would not have been opposed to your countrymen. But if you will not have it so, you are free to go; and remember that, at <b>any</b> <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a friend in Titus; and that when this war is over, and peace restored, if you come to me I will repeat the offer that I have now made.|$|E

6000|$|Lady Sandgate {{measured}} her ground--which scarce seemed extensive.

5000|$|Burt Reynolds {{later said}} the film had a [...] "good script. The guy's a good writer, Lorenzo Semple Jr. Badly directed, kind of {{sloughed}} off. Susan Clark was good; she's a good actress.

Ridden by John Velazquez she took the lead {{approaching}} the final furlong and won by a lengths from Gypsy Robin, with Groupie Doll {{three quarters of a}} length away in third. After the race, Ward said [...] "I've owned this filly for a few years now, and I'm just elated. <b>Any</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> can <b>have</b> a home-court advantage (the horses have) a big advantage and that's what this filly had.

Any {{afternoon}} {{you could find}} them on Eighth Avenue either in front of Spinelli's barber shop, Mike Dugan's place, or the Limerick Hotel, rubbing their forefinger nails with dingy silk handkerchiefs. At <b>any</b> <b>time,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> happened to be standing, undecisive, near a pool-table, and Cliff and Mac had, casually, as it were, drawn near, mentioning something disinterestedly, about a game, well, indeed, would it <b>have</b> been for <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>you</b> gone your way, unresponsive.

5000|$|NPR's Felix Contreras {{weighed in}} on the criticism, {{pointing}} out that [...] " [...] <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a portrayal of an artist where they reflect a history of drug abuse or alcohol abuse" [...] {{there would always be}} criticism, and [...] "in this case, some folks are arguing that the film was focusing on that drug abuse, and not necessarily on what he generated or what he contributed to the music". When commenting on the film, Lopez felt her performance should have earned an Oscar nomination and blamed the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for overlooking both the film and her performance.|$|E

Bernthal said of the character in the first season, [...] "I love the way that he feels about Rick ... I love the friendship there. I love the way he uses this unbelievable dialogue that Frank Darabont wrote to be a good friend to Rick and to be by his side. <b>Any</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> can <b>have</b> a character that starts in one place and go somewhere completely different, that's the journey that we're mostly hungry for." ...|$|R

The {{complexity}} of the tattoo system allows for players to produce unique designs by selecting tattoo shapes, colors and layers, and stylists design outfits and hairstyles. These examples bridge Create-a-Sim Mode and Live Mode, meaning real-time modification of Sims is practical {{for the first time}} in the Sims series.There are 6 possible ways a Sim may die: starvation, drowning, fire, electrocution, old age, or Mummy's Curse. A seventh possible death scenario has been added with Ambitions, Meteor Death.

In the class we define culture in terms of a set of their shared values and practices and beliefs that are shared by a {{people who live in the}} same place, and speak the same language. By being sort of a central component of the definition of culture, <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> are <b>having</b> a writing assignment dealing with culture, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be talking about place in a broad definition of the term.

To do really well <b>you</b> must <b>have</b> some knowledge of what birds are rare and what are common, and I should advise you when we get home to spend <b>any</b> <b>time</b> that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to spare in visiting the Museum and examining the birds there. No doubt {{you will be able to}} find out from one of the attendants which are rare ones, and might be able to consult some books on the subject. <b>You</b> may <b>have</b> the luck to come across skins that are altogether new; and, at any rate, a little knowledge would enable you to exchange your goods to a very much greater advantage than you could otherwise do. A knowledge of that kind is always useful to a sailor, who in his wanderings may well get from the natives rare and valuable specimens in natural history, and there are always plenty of collectors ready to pay good prices for them. I have often regretted that I did not pay attention to such matters when I was young; for besides paying well, it gives a great interest to visits to little-known places, and I have heard of two or three captains who have made a good deal of money by it.” ...|$|R

Dayton, a young engineer from the Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, visited the patent department at Mallory where Carlson worked. Dayton, brought in as an expert witness in a patent appeal case by Mallory, seemed to Carlson to be [...] "the kind of fellow who {{looked like he was}} interested in new ideas." [...] Although Battelle had not previously developed ideas generated by others, Dayton was fascinated by Carlson's invention. When Carlson was invited to Columbus to demonstrate his invention, Dayton's statement to the Battelle scientists and engineers present showed that he understood the importance of Carlson's invention: [...] "However crude this may seem, this is the first <b>time</b> <b>any</b> of <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen a reproduction made without any chemical reaction and a dry process." ...|$|R
