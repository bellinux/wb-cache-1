In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going to see when I first heard about the series. I think the show is doing <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> following the mythology, and Tom {{is doing a good job}} following the tradition.|$|E

Discussing the dinner later, Matthews told The New York Times, [...] "People {{have asked me}} about it. I've never told anyone that I'm running." [...] On November 28, The Patriot-News of Harrisburg reported that Matthews met that week with Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman T.J. Rooney and Executive Director Mary Isenhour to discuss possibly running against Specter. Isenhour told the paper Matthews had not formed a campaign committee or begun raising money, {{and she did not}} believe he had yet come to a firm decision, adding, [...] "He's got <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> with MSNBC.

[...] In the post match press conference, Sigi Schmid praised his team's defensive efforts in the match, saying [...] "We talked about making sure their defenders – and primarily Pável Pardo – didn’t {{have a chance to}} lift their heads and hit those long balls in behind." [...] Schmid continued, [...] "I thought Evans did <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>job.</b> Sometimes we were stretched in the midfield, but I thought he {{did a very good job}} of stepping up to Pável. When you look at the 90 minutes, it was a rare occasion that he was able to hit a ball behind our defense." [...] Chicago midfielder Logan Pause commented on the game saying, [...] "It’s disappointing. We came here to win. We were under the gun all night. They’re a great team, one of the best in the league. It was a great atmosphere and home field advantage. The better team won tonight unfortunately." ...|$|E

500|$|Levi's {{performance}} has garnered widespread acclaim from critics, who enjoyed the actor's comedic delivery and singing voice. Praising the directors' decision to [...] " [...] big-name stars {{in favor of}} lesser-known talent", TV Guide described Levi's performance as [...] "charming, roguish, and, well, generic enough". Similarly, Mike Scott of The Times-Picayune wrote that Levi [...] "comes off as an exaggerated, narcissistic version of the rascally Tory Belleci from TV's MythBusters", complimenting the fact that [...] "the cast's names are less than household stature". Rafer Guzman of Newsday described Levi's performance as [...] "terrific". ABC Online appreciated the fact that [...] "the voices of the hero and heroine were not recognisable", concluding, [...] "Zachary Levi and Mandy Moore ... do <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> on the voices". Dustin Hucks of Film School Rejects wrote that Levi [...] "creates {{a significant amount of}} range and emotion with his voice that truly makes the suave thief with a heart of gold Flynn pop on the screen". Hucks went on to call Flynn [...] "one the better [...] that have come out of the Disney stable in quite a while". Mathew DeKinder of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch appreciated the comedy in Levi's [...] "quick-tongued delivery", while Rolling StonesPeter Travers wrote that the actor [...] "does a nice job" [...] as Flynn. James Luxford of The National wrote that both Levi and Moore [...] "adeptly flesh out what could have been basic characters", while Digital Spys Simon Reynolds described Levi as [...] "excellent as the rogueish hero". Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger called Levi [...] "a surprisingly perfect choice for the self-mocking Flynn". Also pleasantly surprised, David Nusair of About.com wrote that [...] "Levi effortlessly captures the character's transformation from a vain (yet charismatic) rogue to a compassionate love interest". Praising the actor's singing voice, Jim Vejvoda of IGN described it as [...] "impressive".|$|E

According to the terms of the submission request, the only compensated composer would be the winner, who would receive $7,500 in exchange for release of all rights to NBC. The winning entry was written by Gaby Moreno and Vincent Jones. Michael Schur said this theme song was chosen because producers wanted something that would immediately make the viewer associate the music with the series and the characters.

The strength part is great because it really does make her <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> physician. She's <b>really</b> <b>good</b> at her <b>job</b> and she continues to evolve and she continues to look at ways to be 'value added' {{at the hospital and}} is incredibly independent.

One of the goals set by the writing staff {{at the beginning of}} production was to treat the game like a movie and make sure that players playing {{it for the first time}} would [...] "just be able to jump in". Emphasis was put on making the story user friendly for players inexperienced with the franchise because BioWare felt they [...] "didn't do <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of new player orientation" [...] in Mass Effect 2. To begin the writing process, Hudson and Walters sat down and created a story document no longer than three or four pages that contained all the major plot points. Once the document was complete, Walters took the document to the writing staff and began filling out minor details including minor plot points and missions. Once these details were complete and the [...] "backbone of the story" [...] was established, each writer was put in charge of specific levels and missions.

[...] Alonso expressed his huge satisfaction for Bianchi, stating: [...] "I am extremely happy for him, [...] very proud for what this result will mean for his career.

5000|$|The Monkees {{had enjoyed}} {{enormous}} commercial success {{with their first}} two albums, The Monkees and More of the Monkees, both reaching {{number one on the}} Billboard 200. However, under the direction of their music supervisor Don Kirshner, the group was almost completely barred from studio work, aside from recording as vocalists and penning some original material. Longing to achieve creative freedom, the Monkees, led by Michael Nesmith, who felt especially insulted by Kirshner's condescension, entered months of bitter negotiations that eventually concluded with Kirshner's firing. With his departure, the band was finally given the ability to play the instrumentals themselves, making the Headquarters sessions the first of which to feature the actual members on the arrangements. Nesmith compared the Monkees' process to build upon their differing styles: [...] "was like <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> tennis player, and <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> football player, and <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> basketball player, and <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> golfer got together and played baseball. ...
