5|$|The first {{fortification}} at Camber {{may have}} been built shortly after 1486 by Sir Richard Guldeford, the Master of the Ordnance, who was given the manor of Higham by King Henry VII in exchange for Richard constructing <b>a</b> <b>tower</b> to protect the anchorage. There is no surviving evidence, however, to show if <b>a</b> <b>tower</b> was in fact built as Guldeford had promised, and Henry VII did not invest much in his coastal defences {{during the rest of}} his reign. Many castles across England were left in poor repair, often considered to be outdated and too expensive to maintain.|$|E

5|$|At Fontainebleau, Catherine {{arranged}} entertainments {{that lasted}} for several days, including fancy-dress jousting and chivalrous events in allegorical settings. On Mardi Gras, {{the day after the}} banquet in the meadow, knights dressed as Greeks and Trojans fought over scantily clad damsels trapped by a giant and a dwarf in <b>a</b> <b>tower</b> on an enchanted island. The fighting climaxed with the tower losing its magical properties and bursting into flames. In another spectacle, singing sirens swam past the king, and Neptune floated by in a chariot drawn by seahorses.|$|E
5|$|Based on his {{participation}} in the debate and his reputation, Hoffmann received the commission to design the new building. Without any kind of competitive bidding or restrictions, he was commissioned to design it with space for approximately 1,000 employees. In 1900, the prosperous city decided the building should feature <b>a</b> <b>tower.</b> Hoffmann's design was accepted in 1901, and demolition of the existing buildings began. The cornerstone was laid in 1902.|$|E

5|$|Coins of both Carausius and Allectus {{have been}} {{discovered}} buried in {{the foundations of the}} fort's walls. A later coin of 330–335 was found under <b>a</b> <b>tower</b> in the 1930s, suggesting that the fort may have undergone a major repair or reconstruction around that time. The usurpers had inherited an existing system of coastal defence – the earlier Saxon Shore forts – and may have decided to augment it with the construction of Pevensey Castle and its close contemporary, Portus Adurni (Portchester Castle).|$|E
5|$|During the 13th and 14th centuries the barbican was developed. This {{consisted}} of a rampart, ditch, and possibly <b>a</b> <b>tower,</b> {{in front of the}} gatehouse which could be used to further protect the entrance.

Over {{the course of the}} series, they meet two of the guards: Edaniel, a {{grinning}} cat-like creature, and his brother Edrear, who secretly likes Dinah. Vincent dies while in one of the vaults, causing Dinah to become depressed. Later, the hooded angel, which normally guards the entrance to the mausoleum, appears as two stones that talk to Dinah and help her overcome the depression which resulted from Vincent's death.|$|E
5|$|In 1927 Butlin leased a {{piece of}} land from the Earl of Scarbrough by the seaside town of Skegness, where he set up an {{amusement}} park with hoopla stalls, <b>a</b> <b>tower</b> slide, a haunted house ride and, in 1928, a miniature railway and Dodgem carsthese were the first bumper cars in Britain, as Butlin had an exclusive license to import them.|$|E
