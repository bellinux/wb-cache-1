5|$|A {{successful}} {{test for}} beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>international</b> voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202.

Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested {{on a variety of}} surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).|$|E

5|$|An {{adaptation}} of the comics was originally envisioned by producer Tonino Cervi.

This resulted in Bava directing the film on a much lower budget, with more well-known actors taking smaller roles. Many of {{the cast and crew}} members were brought in from Barbarella, De Laurentiis' other comic book {{adaptation of}} that year.|$|E
