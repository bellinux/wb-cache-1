At 16:00 that same afternoon, Galland shot down a No. 611 Squadron Spitfire, but watching his victim for too long, he was himself shot down in Werknummer (Factory number) 6713, code [...] "<- + -", by a 145 Squadron Spitfire flown by Sergeant R.J.C.

500|$|Gaga {{opened the}} 2011 MuchMusic Video Awards with a {{performance}} of the song, sporting a bejeweled catsuit and a bob teal colored wig. While on tour in Japan, Gaga performed [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] and [...] "Born This Way" [...] at the 2011 MTV Video Music Aid Japan. She started the performance while hanging from a giant spider web, with her aquamarine hair extensions stuck in it. Beginning to sing, Gaga pulled <b>and</b> <b>tugged</b> at the web, and ultimately broke free to join her dancers as she finished the performance. On October 16, 2011 she performed the song during a concert at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles for the Clinton Foundation. [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] was performed regularly as the penultimate song of Gaga's [...] Born This Way Ball (2012–2013) tour where she played {{the beginning of the}} song on piano atop a watch tower. She wore a Versace-designed cloth for the performance. In 2014, Gaga sang a short version of the song during the [...]|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to verify if there is sex {{difference}} in the associations among handgrip strength, peak expiratory flow (PEF) and timed up <b>and</b> go (<b>TUG)</b> test results. METHODS: The sample included 288 consecutive elderly men (n= 93) and women (n= 195). Functional capacity was measured using the <b>TUG</b> test, <b>and</b> muscle strength was measured based on handgrip. Moreover, as a measure of current health status, PEF was evaluated. Linear regression procedures were performed to analyze the relationships between handgrip and both PEF <b>and</b> <b>TUG</b> test results, with adjustment for confounders, and to identify the possible mediating role of PEF in the association between handgrip strength <b>and</b> <b>TUG</b> test results. RESULTS: In men, handgrip strength was associated with both PEF <b>and</b> <b>TUG</b> performance (p< 0. 01). After adjustment for PEF, the relationship between handgrip strength <b>and</b> <b>TUG</b> performance remained significant. In women, handgrip strength was also associated with both PEF <b>and</b> <b>TUG</b> performance (p< 0. 01). However, after adjustment for PEF, the relationship between handgrip strength <b>and</b> <b>TUG</b> performance was no longer significant. CONCLUSION: Mobility in the elderly is sex dependent. In particular, PEF mediates the relationship between handgrip strength <b>and</b> <b>TUG</b> performance in women, but not in men...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} Barthel Index (BI), a {{well-known}} and accepted measure of functional disability, with Timed Up <b>and</b> Go (<b>TUG).</b> Method: Thirty-three stroke patients had their BI <b>and</b> <b>TUG</b> assessed by independent blinded observers. Results: There was good agreement between BI <b>and</b> <b>TUG,</b> with good repeatability. Conclusion: Thus TUG {{is a good}} measure of function pre-discharge but needs to be further validated on more disabled patients...|$|R

While reviewing a concert by Adele, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK, said [...] "There wasn't a dry eye in the house as Adele powered {{her way through the}} ballad, encouraging the audience to help her sing the somewhat beautiful, yet emotional chorus – giving everyone goosebumps. The sounds of Someone Like You bounced off every wall <b>and</b> <b>tugged</b> at every heart-string, making it a truly special moment and something that every member of the Apollo crowd will never forget." [...] Jim Harrington of San Jose Mercury News chose the song as a highlight on the show adding that the song showed [...] "her supreme vocal talent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pollentier {{was called}} to the drugs test with José Nazabal and Antoine Guttierez. Nazabal gave his sample but {{anticipated}} the positive result by leaving the race that night. When Guttierez went to provide his sample, the doctor – a man called Le Calvez spending his first day with the race – grew suspicious <b>and</b> <b>tugged</b> up his jersey, revealing a system of tubes {{and a bottle of}} urine. He then pulled down Pollentier's shorts and found him similarly equipped. Reports in the press called the supply of urine – somebody else's urine – as being in a bottle. Riders called it a [...] "pear". In fact it was a condom. The tube ran from there to the riders' shorts so that pressure on the condom, held under the armpit, would give the impression of urinating.|$|E
