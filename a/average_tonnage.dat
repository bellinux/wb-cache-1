50|$|By the Late Middle Ages the cog, and cog-like square-rigged vessels {{equipped}} with a rudder at the stern, were widely used along the coasts of Europe, from the Mediterranean, to the Baltic. Given {{the conditions of the}} Mediterranean, galley type vessels were extensively used there, as were various two masted vessels, including the caravels with their lateen sails. These and similar ship types were familiar to Portuguese navigators and shipwrights. As the Portuguese gradually extended their trade ever further south along Africa's Atlantic coast during the 15th century, they needed a larger, more durable and more advanced sailing ships for their long oceanic ventures. Gradually, they developed their own models of oceanic carracks from a fusion and modification of aspects of the ship types they knew operating in both the Atlantic and Mediterranean, generalizing their use in {{the end of the century}} for inter-oceanic travel with a more advanced form of sail rigging that allowed much improved sailing characteristics in the heavy winds and waves of the Atlantic Ocean and a hull shape and size that permitted larger cargoes. In addition to the <b>average</b> <b>tonnage</b> naus, some large naus (carracks) were also built in the reign of John II of Portugal, but were only widespread after the turn of the century.

The number of boats used per year ranged from 13 (1967-68, 1983-84) to 24 (1965), with 21 per annum between 1975 and 1982. Their <b>average</b> <b>tonnage</b> and horsepower increased from 56 (1971) to 74.5 tons (1982) and from about 220 (1971) to nearly 539 horsepower (1982).

Minkes were permitted to be landed for flensing at the main whaling stations of Ulsan, on the east coast, and Ucheango, on the west coast, as well as Jukbyeon, Kuryongpo, Heusando, Daichangdo, and Cheju. By the early 1960s a few hundred were being caught each year. The catch increased from 715 in 1970, to 882 in 1973, to a peak of 1,033 and 1,018 in 1977 and 1978. Minkes were caught almost year-round (February to December), with the most important whaling ground being the central Yellow Sea from March to April. From there, catches extended to the Korean Strait in May and the southwestern Sea of Japan from June to October. Most were caught from April to June, with a peak in the Yellow Sea in April and in the Sea of Japan in June. They were also caught in the northern Yellow Sea and off the east coast of North Korea (before 1936), where peak catches were reached from May to June and from April to June, respectively. About 16,000 were caught between 1940 and 1986, when hunting of minke whales ceased.|$|E

Jimeta is the administrative headquarter of the Adamawa state. The population has been on a steady increase mainly due to influx of people and its strategic location along axial route linking major cities in the northeast region. Data for this study were obtained from the Adamawa State Environmental Protection Agency (ASEPA) and relevant literature. Records show that waste are neither sorted nor recycled but dumped in an open dumpsite 3 km away from the city. The performance of agency regarding waste evacuation from source of generation to final disposal point has improved but not been impressive from 2004 to date. Results shows that the agency performed below <b>average</b> as large <b>tonnage</b> of solid waste can be seen at designated dumpsites thereby blocking drainage channels and access road. Thus, 11, 747 tons of solid waste was collected over the period of 4 years from 2004 - 2008. However, this figure increased to 16, 151 tons in 2009 - 2013. This achievement was as a result of change in the leadership of the management team and better funding from the government. It is advocated that solid waste management should not be left in the hands of government agency alone. The public and related stakeholders should actively participate in the management of solid waste so as to have a functional environment for working, living and playing. Keywords...|$|R

He was a {{stranger}} to Exmoor, and was on holiday in Minehead when he heard of the problems which were starting to arise due {{to the absence of}} deer control due to the death of the last master. At this time of war sporting considerations were secondary. He offered to undertake the mastership at his own expense without any funding guaranteed, and continued until the 1919-20 season when he retired to Badminton. MacDermot wrote of him: [...] "Staghunters and the country in general owe a very deep debt of gratitude to his memory for keeping the hunt going, largely at his own expense, through a most difficult time". He was a shipowner and changed his name from [...] "Badcock" [...] to [...] "Badco" [...] by deed-poll dated 11 March 1916, who lived [...] "formerly" [...] at St Ives, Cornwall, but who was living in 1916 at Cathedral Street, Cardiff. He was from St Ives and started his career as a clerk with a Mr Haines. In 1900 he floated the Polurrian Steamship Co. Ltd., to raise funds for the purchase of the steamer of that name then being built at Blumen's yard in Sunderland. He similarly floated the Poldhu Steamship Co. Ltd., the following year to acquire the Poldhu from the same yard. He moved from St Ives in 1909 to Cardiff and took delivery of his third new vessell the Polvarth. The Pol- prefix of his ships was a Cornish reference. Between 1910 -13 he bought three second-hand ships, the Polmanter, Polcarne and Polperro, to meet the improving market. However before the end of WW I he had sold 5 of his ships, having lost one to a U-boat attack. The <b>average</b> <b>tonnage</b> of his vessels was about 3,000 tons.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{evidence}} minke whales were caught in Japan during the harpoon and net whaling eras. The small-type catcher boat Yuko-maru 7 GRT caught the first minkes out of Akukawa in 1930. In {{the first half of}} the 1930s, about 20-30 was taken per year out of this port. Minke whaling soon spread to the port of Kamaishi (1938), on the northeast coast of Honshu; Ogawajima (about 1951), on the west coast of Kyushu; and to Wakasa Bay and Aomori (both by 1957), the former on the west coast and the latter on the north coast of Honshu. An average of 23 catcher boats - each of which averaged about 23 tons between 1952 and 1986 - were involved each year between 1950 and 1986, from a peak of 80 in 1950 to a low of seven from 1973 to 1978 - these boats also caught other species, mainly giant beaked whales, short-finned pilot whales, and killer whales. As the number of boats declined the <b>average</b> <b>tonnage</b> increased dramatically, from 14.6 in 1952 to 39 in 1982. In 1979, nine catchers averaged about 360 horsepower - they ranged from 15.2 tons and 150 horsepower for the tiny Katsu Maru (1978-1986) to the 36.99-ton Koei Maru No. 7 at 450 horsepower. The largest was the 47.77-ton Sumitomo Maru No. 31, which operated from 1982 to 1986. These vessels used harpoon guns of 50 mm caliber or less. Because of their small size, limited cruising range, and inability to work during inclement weather, catchers were restricted to within 50 nautical miles of their home port in the 1950s, while the vast majority operated within 80 nautical miles of their home ports or designated unloading ports (for Hokkaido) during the period 1977 to 1987. In 1968 small motorboats were introduced, which scared the whales into swimming quickly at the surface, making them easier to track and exhausting them in the process - this allowed them to be more easily killed as well. The earliest were 4.5 m long and 2 tons with 65-80 horsepower outboard engines; later 4.9 to 5.2 m boats with 165 horsepower were utilized. The number of catchers using motorboats increased rapidly from 1968 to 1972; by 1979 they all used them.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the study}} on the Port Alfred/Kenton-on-Sea/Boknes linefishery by Hecht and Tilney (1989) there have been {{substantive}} changes to the linefish management environment in South Africa. Using the Port Alfred linefishery as a model, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the linefish management regulations that were implemented by Marine and Coastal Management (MCM) since 1992, and to assess the behaviour and 'status' of the fishery in response to these changes. Changes to both the licensing structure and catch regulations have had a significant effect on the functioning of many aspects of the Port Alfred linefishery (fishing effort, catch composition, cpue) as well as on the structure of the fishery and its socio-economic profile. Overall commercial cpue decreased from 1985 to 1998. Since 1998 there has been a significant increase in cpue (from 2. 3 Kg. fisher‚Åª¬π hour‚Åª¬π to a peak of 4. 8 Kg. fisher‚Åª¬π. hour‚Åª¬π in 2005. This was attributed to good catches of geelbek, particularly in 2005, 2007 and 2008 (during these years geelbek contributed an average of 35 % to the total landings in comparison to a mean contribution of II % between 1985 and 2004). However, size spectra analysis suggests that the increase in overall cpue since 1998 misrepresents the actual status of the fishery. If geelbek is excluded from the analysis on the grounds that it is the only species in the fishery that is highly migratory, susceptible to recruitment fluctuations and it does not contribute to the catches on a year round basis, then the results suggest that the fishery is still in a declining phase despite the 80 % reduction in commercial effort and numerous stricter catch regulations (e. g. size/bag limits). Furthermore, the cpue of silver kob, which has been the "mainstay" species of the fishery, has consistently declined over the last 23 year period (from 1. 69 Kg. fisher‚Åª 1. hour 1 in 1986 to 0. 86 Kg. fisher‚Åª 1. hour‚Åª 1 in 2007). The substantial reduction in commercial effort in the fishery from 33 vessels in 2001 to 13 in 2002 resulted in a shift from commercial to recreational fishing. The number of active commercial vessels in Port Alfred alone decreased from 29 in 1989 (Hecht 1993) to four in 2008. During the same timeframe, the number of regularly active recreational vessels had almost doubled (16 in 1989 to 26 in 2008). Despite the greater number of recreational boats in the fishery they only landed approximately half the <b>average</b> yearly <b>tonnage</b> of the commercial vessels (21, 5 and 44, 7 tonnes,annum-I, respectively) between 2006 and 2008, This was ascribed to the differences in catch regulations for the two sectors, Furthermore, it was speculated that increasing operating costs and narrowing profit margins have contributed to lower levels of compliance in both the commercial and recreational sectors since 2006, For example, 16 % of silver kob landed during 2006 - 08 were under the minimum size, Despite the changes made to the regulations since 1998 and the 60, 6 % reduction In legislated commercial effort in the fishery between 2001 and 2002 it was concluded that the fishery has continued to decline, Except for the good recruitment of geelbek (which may be due to regulatory changes made in 1992) the changes in the management environment have had no measurable positive effect on this fishery, It is recommended that commercial effort should not be allowed to increase beyond the current number of active boats, that there should be an area restriction on all commerciallinefish vessels, that the current recreational bag limit for silver kob should be re-assessed, there should also be a concerted and nationally funded effort to educate recreational anglers about the merits of catch and release, and the frequency of catch inspections of both sectors should be increased,KMBT_ 363 Adobe Acrobat 9. 54 Paper Capture Plug-i...|$|R
40|$|Mine {{design and}} mine {{planning}} {{are essential to}} a mining operation as they do not only dictate {{the outline of the}} mine, but essentially determine the financial robustness and success of the mining operation. However, as mining is a conservative business mine design is still mostly done by hand. To indicate the effect of uncertainty in mine design, Vallee (2000) reported that 60 % of the reviewed mines had an average production rate that was 30 % lower than their designed capacity. To provide in better mine design researchers and companies have developed and proposed number of guidance tools in recent years to help optimize mine planning. However their efforts have mainly focussed on open-pit mine design whilst largely ignoring underground mining, which is more versatile and therefore more difficult to assess. Furthermore, the optimization algorithms that have been developed are mostly based on average-type or interpolated resource models, which do not allow assessing uncertainty. Several stochastic approaches have been proposed by Dimitrakopoulos and others as a tool to involve stochastic techniques in mine design optimization as a way to assess uncertainty. However, few practical stochastic solutions have been developed for underground mine design. To contribute to the recent efforts made by the TU Delft in the ‚ÄòHorizon 2020 ‚Äì Real Time Mining‚Äô European Union Research and Innovation Programme, this research has focussed on combining underground mine design optimization with several stochastic analyses. A stope layout optimizer was developed in Matlab based on standard genetic algorithms, a sub-group of evolutionary algorithms. This model was tested on two validation data sets where it showed good optimization performance. A stochastic optimization module was added and tested, but as the validation data set was linear, it showed no added value. Using a resource model of a copper / zinc VMS deposit a number of stochastic approaches were tested. By performing a minimal downside risk / maximum upside potential analysis a stochastic optimization and elimination approach was tested under different economic scenarios by using 20 unconditional economic block model simulations. A stochastic risk analysis using the same 20 economic block models was done to study the effect of stochastic probability on economic value, ore <b>tonnage,</b> waste <b>tonnage,</b> <b>average</b> ore grade and average arsenic content. Lastly, a stochastic design optimization was done using 100 unconditional economic block models and its optimization performance was compared to that for a traditional non-stochastic optimization. Both the minimal downside risk / maximum upside potential analysis and the stochastic design analysis showed better optimization results than traditional optimization using average type orebody models. However, as in the min / max approach emphasis was on robustness instead of profitability, it was unable to show the same degree of improvement over traditional optimization.

Since 2002, Congress has appropriated an average of $ 2 billion per year for U. S. food aid programs, which delivered an average of 4 million metric tons of food commodities per year. Despite growing demand for food aid, rising business and transportation costs have contributed to a 52 percent decline in <b>average</b> <b>tonnage</b> delivered over the last 5 years. These costs represent 65 percent of total emergency food aid, highlighting the need to maximize its efficiency and effectiveness. Based on analysis of agency documents, interviews with experts and practitioners, and fieldwork, this report examines some key challenges to the (1) efficiency of U.

30|$|Concerning the {{delivery}} trips, first, {{the number of}} customers and the <b>average</b> <b>tonnage</b> per customer are determined for each calendar day and delivery zone. Then the trip lengths and the travel times are requested for a departure time of 8 : 00 ¬†a.m. for the legs between the TSPs and the reference customers. In doing so, the actual weekday is considered. The same values are requested for a departure time of 4 : 00 ¬†p.m. for the return legs from the reference customers to the TSPs. Concerning the local trips, trip lengths and travel times are requested for a sample of customer‚Äìcustomer trips in the considered delivery zone and on the considered weekday for a departure time between 10 : 00 ¬†a.m. and 2 : 00 ¬†p.m. and, then, the average is established. This is also done for the same legs for a departure time of 10 : 30 ¬†p.m. (free-flow). Finally, Eqs.¬†(1)‚Äì(3) are used to create {{the delivery}} trips for the normal and the hypothetic free-flow situation.|$|E
40|$|A simple {{expression}} {{for the global}} average ambient noise is derived in terms of parameters representing {{the characteristics of the}} sound sources, the number of such sources and the propagation properties of the deep ocean, and used to explore possible causes of increasing low frequency noise in the deep ocean. A 5 dB increase in noise level over 35 years, reported by [Andrew et al., ARLO 3, 65 - 70 (2002) ], is explained by the increase in the total number of ocean-going ships and their <b>average</b> <b>tonnage,</b> with no evidence of any significant change in source level during that time. The theoretical effect of increasing transparency to low frequency sound, which has been proposed as a possible cause of part of this increasing noise [Hester et al., Geophysical Research Letters 35, L 19601 (2008) ], is less than 1 dB to date. Predicted changes in the 21 st century might be positive or negative depending on the relative contributions from the change in pH (which is expected to increase globally averaged noise) and the change in sea surface temperature (expected to decrease noise) ...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the impact}} of {{fisheries}} on the commercial fish stocks requires detailed catch statistics and data on the dynamics of fleet and catch effort, at least before industrial fishing started. Most time series on the fleet dynamics start after the 1980 s, at times when major changes in fleet characteristics had already taken place. In the present paper, {{the results of the}} integration of data on fleet size (from 1830), tonnage (from 1842) and engine power (kW, from 1912) of the Belgian sea fisheries fleet are presented. The decrease in fleet size and changes in overall tonnage and engine power {{since the beginning of the}} reconstructed time series, are quantified. The data show that the decrease in fleet size (- 85 %) and in overall engine power (- 5 %) was compensated by an increase in <b>average</b> <b>tonnage</b> per vessel (x 10 increase) and in average engine power per vessel (x 6 increase). The overall fishing effort of the fleet expressed as the total number of days spent at sea has decreased by approximately - 84 % between 1938 and 2010, while the average amount of fish landed per day per vessel (1, 000 kg in 2008 - 2010) has at least doubled in the same period. The data reconstruction provides a unique view on the dynamics in the sea fisheries fleet of Belgium over 180 years and the political and social events associated to these changes...|$|E
40|$|Background: Ports provide vital {{links in}} the {{maritime}} supply chains {{on which the}} trading of countries depend, and their efficiency and performance can contribute largely to the international competitiveness of those countries. However, to achieve and maintain such a contribution, port operators need to understand their role in a national economy and the factors that underlie {{the efficiency of the}} intermodal link that ports constitute in international supply chains. One such factor is the capacity of specialised cargo terminals. Objectives: This article described a possible technique for forecasting the throughput of grain imports through the bulk grain terminal at the Port of Cape Town. It determined whether the capacity in the bulk grain terminal is sufficient to handle current and forecasted volumes of imported grains or whether the volumes justify expansion or upgrading of the bulk grain terminal in the Port of Cape Town. Method: The Box‚ÄìJenkins methodology for autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models was applied. An ARIMA model ‚Äì 2 parameter, 1 difference ‚Äì was selected to do the forecast. Results: The <b>average</b> <b>tonnage</b> of all grains imported through the Port of Cape Town that can be expected in a month is approximately 90 000 tons. The maximum tonnage of all grains imported through the Port of Cape Town that can be expected in a month is approximately 180 000 tons. Conclusion: The analyses show that the demand for imports of grain products at the multipurpose terminal in the Port of Cape Town is not growing substantially. The analyses also identify that the current upper limits of grain imports are within the existing handling and storage capacities of the bulk grain terminal. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{wastewater}} management objective for a tomato processor is to implement sound and performance guaranteed systems which minimize wastewater related costs. Using performance parameter values {{found in this}} project, it was demonstrated that installation and operation of an in-plant water recycle system with off-line mud removal would result in approximately 50 % savings in the total annual wastewater related costs. For the 35 ton/hr plant evaluated, annual savings would amount to approximately $ 47, 000. The ' 75 season performance parameter values were obtained from investigation of four modes of operation; conventional cleaning; conventional cleaning with water recycle; disc cleaner with water recycle; and, disc cleaner with recycle and chemical coagulation-f loccul ation. Water consumption and total solids balances were made on each mode. Not surprisingly the daily <b>average</b> <b>tonnage</b> of tomatoes processed increased substantially with disc cleaning and water recycle {{as compared to the}} conventional system. An increase of 26 % in the tonnage of tomatoes processed was realized with the disc cleaner with water recycle and chemical flocculation. These increases in the daily tonnage of tomatoes processed may be primarily due to the virtual elimination of solids accumulation in the dump tank with consequent impaired product flow. No incident of temporary shutdown of shift operation for dump tank clean-up was encountered during the modes of operation with water recycle. With respect to the water consumption, the following findings were established in this study: 1. The majority of daily water usage was operational (48 - 61 %) followed by clean-up (31 - 44 %) and filling (6 - 8 %). There were no significant variations in percentage usage in the various modes of operations. In a 1 1 modes of operation approximately 7 % was filling; approximately 55 % operational; and approximately 39 % clean-up. 2. A 26 % decrease in the average total daily water usage was realized when disc cleaner with water recycle and chemical flocculation relative to the conventional system was applied...|$|E
