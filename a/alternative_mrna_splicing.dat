Increased levels of AMACR are also associated with some breast, colon, and other cancers, but it is unclear exactly what the role of AMACR is in these cancers.|$|E
50|$|The {{canonical}} Cr2/CD21 gene of subprimate mammals produces {{two types}} of complement receptor (CR1, ca. 200 kDa; CR2, ca. 145 kDa) via <b>alternative</b> <b>mRNA</b> <b>splicing.</b> The murine Cr2 gene contains 25 exons; a common first exon is spliced to exon 2 and to exon 9 in transcripts encoding CR1 and CR2, respectively. A transcript with an open reading frame of 4,224 nucleotides encodes the long isoform, CR1; this is predicted to be a protein of 1,408 amino acids that includes 21 short consensus repeats (SCR) of ca. 60 amino acids each, plus transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. Isoform CR2 (1,032 amino acids) is encoded by a shorter transcript (3,096 coding nucleotides) that lacks exons 2-8 encoding SCR1-6. CR1 and CR2 on murine B cells form complexes with a co-accessory activation complex containing CD19, CD81, and the fragilis/Ifitm (murine equivalents of LEU13) proteins.|$|E

40|$|The innate immune {{response}} {{plays a key}} role in fighting infection by activating inflammation and stimulating the adaptive {{immune response}}. However, chronic activation of innate immunity can contribute to the pathogenesis of many diseases with an inflammatory component. Thus, various negatively acting factors turn off innate immunity subsequent to its activation to ensure that inflammation is self-limiting and to prevent inflammatory disease. These negatively acting pathways include the production of inhibitory acting alternate proteins encoded by <b>alternative</b> <b>mRNA</b> <b>splice</b> forms of genes in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. We previously found that the SF 3 a <b>mRNA</b> <b>splicing</b> complex was required for a robust innate immune response; SF 3 a acts to promote inflammation in part by inhibiting the production of a negatively acting splice form of the TLR signaling adaptor MyD 88. Here we inhibit SF 3 a 1 using RNAi and subsequently perform an RNAseq study to identify the full complement of genes and splicing events regulated by SF 3 a in murine macrophages. Surprisingly, in macrophages, SF 3 a has significant preference for <b>mRNA</b> <b>splicing</b> events within innate immune signaling pathways compared with other biological pathways, thereby affecting the splicing of specific genes in the TLR signaling pathway to modulate the innate immune response...|$|R
50|$|The human SYNE2 gene encodes {{a protein}} of 6,885 amino acids (isoform 1, Nesp2 giant); <b>alternative</b> <b>mRNA</b> <b>splicing</b> {{produces}} transcripts encoding a larger isoform and numerous smaller isoforms, {{some of which}} are specific to various tissues; alternative start and termination sites within the mRNA also allow translation of smaller isoforms, many possessing unique N- or C-terminal sequences encoded by retained introns. Two mechanisms create splice variants of nesprin-2 with the KASH domain deleted (deltaKASH). In deltaKASH1 variants, deletion of cassette exons 111-112 results in a frame shift that disrupts the KASH domain but retains the 3' untranslated region (UTR) in exon 116 utilized for isoforms containing the KASH domain. This mechanism, which also occurs in SYNE1 mRNA encoding nesprin-1 (enaptin), generates deltaKASH1 isoforms terminating with a distinct 11-amino acid tail (GIAGHSATPPA replacing YPMLRYTNGPPPT in isoforms with KASH). Utilization of an alternative stop codon in exon 115, which is followed by a distinct 3' UTR, generates deltaKASH2 variants. This mechanism truncates larger isoforms without generating a distinct C-terminal sequence. Expression of deltaKASH1 variants occurs largely in brain and kidney, with smaller amounts in heart; deltaKASH2 variants are detected in heart and spleen.|$|E

40|$|<b>Alternative</b> <b>mRNA</b> <b>splicing</b> is an {{important}} means of diversifying function in higher eukaryotes. Notably, both NCoR and SMRT corepressors are subject to <b>alternative</b> <b>mRNA</b> <b>splicing,</b> yielding a series of distinct corepressor variants with highly divergent functions. Normal adipogenesis {{is associated with a}} switch in corepressor splicing fromNCoR to NCoR, which appears to help regulate this differentiation process. We report here that mimicking this development switch in mice by a splice-specific whole-animal ablation of NCoR is very different from a whole-animal or tissue-specific total NCoR knockout and produces significantly enhanced weight gain on a high-fat diet. Surprisingly, NCoR/mice are protected against diet-induced glucose intolerance despite enhanced adiposity and the presence of multiple additional, prodiabetic phenotypic changes. Our results indicate that the change in NCoR splicing during normal development both helps drive normal adipocyte differentiation and {{plays a key role in}} determining a metabolically appropriate storage of excess calories. We also conclude that whole-gene “knock-outs ” fail to reveal how important gene products are customized, tailored, and adapted through <b>alternative</b> <b>mRNA</b> <b>splicing</b> and thus do not reveal all the functions of the protein products of that gene. Agiven transcription factor, by physically exchanging corepres-sor complexes for coactivator complexes, can convert from a repressor to an activator of gene expression (1).

Remarkably, this single cysteine is flanked by Leu 117 and Val 124, which are two essential β-branched amino acids forming the heterocomplex of NtA with the γ 1 chain of laminin.

40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} {{alternative splicing}} {{of the liver}} intestine-cadherin (LI-cadherin) gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and correlate its aberrant expression with clinical outcomes. Experimental Design: Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time RT-PCR were used to examine <b>alternative</b> <b>mRNA</b> <b>splicing</b> and mRNA level of LI-cadherin in 50 paired tumor-peritumor tissues of 50 HCC and 8 normal liver specimens. The minigene exon-trapping strategy was employed to investigate the splicing mechanism introduced by nucleotide polymorphisms. Association of LI-cadherin splicing with tumor venous infiltration, first-year tumor recurrence, and overall survival after partial hepatectomy were determined. Results: <b>Alternative</b> <b>mRNA</b> <b>splicing</b> of LI-cadherin was identified in half of the HCC specimens. Sequencing analysis indicated the loss of exon 7 in the spliced LI-cadherin gene. LI-cadherin mRNA was up-regulated from 2. 58 -fold to 800 -fold in over 80 % of HCC samples when compared with normal liver by quantitative PCR. Furthermore, nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in putative branch point at IVS 6 + 35 (intron 6) {{as well as in}} coding sequence 651 (exon 6) in HCC tissues, which may affect <b>alternative</b> <b>mRNA</b> <b>splicing.</b> Clinically, those patients who harbored the alternative splicing of LI-cadherin were strongly associated with shorter overall survival time (P < 0. 01) as well as higher incidences of tumor recurrences and venous infiltration (both P < 0. 05) after hepatectomy. Conclusions: Over-expression of LI-cadherin was frequently detected in liver cancer patients.

40|$|Rationale: Altered {{expression}} of glutamate transporter EAAT 2 protein {{has been reported}} in the hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Two <b>alternative</b> EAAT 2 <b>mRNA</b> <b>splice</b> forms, one resulting from a partial retention of intron 7 (I 7 R), the other from a deletion of exon 9 (E 9 S), were previously implicated in the loss of EAAT 2 protein in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Methods: By RT-PCR we studied the occurrence of 17 R and E 9 S in neocortical and hippocampal specimens from TLE patients and non-neurological controls. Results: Both splice forms were found in all neocortical specimens from TLE patients (100 % I 7 R, 100 % E 9 S). This was significantly more than in controls (67 % I 7 R, 60 % E 9 S; P < 0. 05). We also detected I 7 R and E 9 S in all seven motor cortex post-mortem samples from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Within the TLE patient group, both splice variants appeared significantly more in non-sclerotic (100 %), than in sclerotic hippocampi (69 %, P < 0. 05). Conclusion: These data indicate that the epileptic brain, especially that of TLE patients without hippocampal sclerosis, is highly prone to <b>alternative</b> EAAT 2 <b>mRNA</b> <b>splicing.</b> Our data confirm that the presence of alternative EAAT 2 splice forms is not disease specific.

Here we show that SAP 97 is present in CaMKII immune complexes isolated from rodent brain {{as well as from}} HEK 293 cells co-expressing CaMKIIα and SAP 97. CaMKIIα phosphorylated recombinant SAP 97 within immune complexes in vitro and in intact cells.

CaMKIIα preferentially phosphorylated a full-length SAP 97 and a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the I 3 and I 5 inserts (SAP 97 -I 3 I 5 and GST-SH 3 -I 3 I 5 -GK, respectively) and also specifically interacted with GST-SH 3 -I 3 I 5 -GK compared with GST proteins containing other naturally occurring insert combinations. AKAP 79 / 150 also directly and specifically bound only to GST-SH 3 -I 3 I 5 -GK, but CaMKII phosphorylation of GST-SH 3 -I 3 I 5 -GK prevented this interaction. AKAP 79 -dependent down-regulation of GluR 1 AMPAR currents was ablated by overexpression of SAP 97 -I 2 I 5 (which does not bind AKAP 79) or by infusion of active CaMKIIα. Collectively, the data suggest that CaMKIIα targets a specific SAP 97 splice variant to disengage AKAP 79 / 150 from regulating GluR 1 AMPARs, providing new insight into protein-protein interactions and phosphorylation events that are required for normal regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission, learning, and memory...|$|R

T lymphocytes are critical for generating cellular immunity and memory following infections (e. g. CD 4 + and CD 8 + TCR ab + cells), they are also involved in immune regulation (e. g.

We have recently identified a novel role for the nuclear protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein L-like (hnRNPLL) for the homeostasis of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells in the peripheral immune system through the characterization of a mouse strain derived from an ENU mutagenesis screen (1).

We immunoscreened several mouse tissues and cells for the presence of truncated Nox 2 proteins and identified a 30 kDa protein in lung, spleen and macrophages. RT-PCR analysis of mRNA from primary and immortalised (RAW 264. 7) mouse macrophages, and from human alveolar macrophages, identified a truncated Nox 2 transcript which, upon sequence analysis, was found to be a product of the &# 039;exon skipping&# 039; mode of alternative splicing, lacking exons 4 - 10 of the Nox 2 gene. The predicted protein is comparable in size to that identified by immunoscreening and contains two transmembrane helices and an extended cytosolic C-terminus with binding sites for NADPH and the Nox organiser protein p 47 phox.

40|$|Abstract Background Previous whole-genome shotgun {{bisulfite}} sequencing experiments showed that DNA cytosine methylation in the honey bee (Apis mellifera) is almost exclusively at CG dinucleotides in exons. However, {{the most commonly}} used method, {{bisulfite sequencing}}, cannot distinguish 5 -methylcytosine from 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine, an oxidized form of 5 -methylcytosine that is catalyzed by the TET family of dioxygenases. Furthermore, some analysis software programs under-represent non-CG DNA methylation and hydryoxymethylation for a variety of reasons. Therefore, we used an unbiased analysis of bisulfite sequencing data combined with molecular and bioinformatics approaches to distinguish 5 -methylcytosine from 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine. By doing this, we have performed the first whole genome analyses of DNA modifications at non-CG sites in honey bees and correlated the effects of these DNA modifications on gene expression and <b>alternative</b> <b>mRNA</b> <b>splicing.</b> Results We confirmed, using unbiased analyses of whole-genome shotgun bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) data, with both new data and published data, the previous finding that CG DNA methylation is enriched in exons in honey bees. However, we also found evidence that cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation at non-CG sites is enriched in introns. Using antibodies against 5 -hydroxmethylcytosine, we confirmed that DNA hydroxymethylation at non-CG sites is enriched in introns. Additionally, using a new technique, Pvu-seq (which employs the enzyme PvuRts 1 l to digest DNA at 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine sites followed by next-generation DNA sequencing), we further confirmed that hydroxymethylation is enriched in introns at non-CG sites. Conclusions Cytosine hydroxymethylation at non-CG sites might have more functional significance than previously appreciated, and in honey bees these modifications might be related to the regulation of <b>alternative</b> <b>mRNA</b> <b>splicing</b> by defining the locations of the introns...|$|E
40|$|Background: Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a {{hereditary}} neuropathy {{caused by}} mutations in the IKBKAP gene, {{the most common}} of which results in variable tissue-specific <b>mRNA</b> <b>splicing</b> with skipping of exon 20. Defective splicing is especially severe in nervous tissue, leading to incomplete development and progressive degeneration of sensory and autonomic neurons. The specificity of neuron loss in FD is poorly understood {{due to the lack of}} an appropriate model system. To better understand and modelize the molecular mechanisms of IKBKAP <b>mRNA</b> <b>splicing,</b> we collected human olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cells (hOE-MSC) from FD patients. hOE-MSCs have a pluripotent ability to differentiate into various cell lineages, including neurons and glial cells. Methodology/Principal Findings: We confirmed IKBKAP <b>mRNA</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>splicing</b> in FD hOE-MSCs and identified 2 novel spliced isoforms also present in control cells. We observed a significant lower expression of both IKBKAP transcript and IKAP/ hELP 1 protein in FD cells resulting from the degradation of the transcript isoform skipping exon 20. We localized IKAP/ hELP 1 in different cell compartments, including the nucleus, which supports multiple roles for that protein. We also investigated cellular pathways altered in FD, at the genome-wide level, and confirmed that cell migration and cytoskeleton reorganization were among the processes altered in FD. Indeed, FD hOE-MSCs exhibit impaired migration compared to control cells. Moreover, we showed that kinetin improved exon 20 inclusion and restores a normal level of IKAP/hELP 1 in F...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Large {{conductance}} calcium- and voltage activated potassium (BK) {{channels are}} important determinants of neuronal excitability through effects on action potential duration, frequency and synaptic efficacy. The pore- forming subunits are encoded {{by a single}} gene, KCNMA 1, which undergoes extensive <b>alternative</b> pre <b>mRNA</b> <b>splicing.</b> Different splice variants can confer distinct properties on BK channels. For example, insertion of the 58 amino acid stress-regulated exon (STREX) insert, that is conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, encodes channels with distinct calcium sensitivity and regulation by diverse signalling pathways compared to the insertless (ZERO) variant. Thus, expression of distinct splice variants may allow cells to differentially shape their electrical properties during development. However, whether differential splicing of BK channel variants occurs during development of the mammalian CNS has not been examined. Results Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Taqman™ assays, we demonstrate that total BK channel transcripts are up regulated throughout the murine CNS during embryonic and postnatal development with regional variation in transcript levels. This upregulation {{is associated with a}} decrease in STREX variant mRNA expression and an upregulation in ZERO variant expression. Conclusion As BK channel splice variants encode channels with distinct functional properties the switch in splicing from the STREX phenotype to ZERO phenotype during embryonic and postnatal CNS development may provide a mechanism to allow BK channels to control distinct functions at different times of mammalian brain development. </p...|$|R
40|$|Insulin system {{including}} ligands (insulin and IGFs) {{and their}} shared receptors (IR and IGFR) are critical regulators of insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis. Altered insulin system {{is associated with}} major pathological conditions like diabetes and cancer. The mRNAs encoding for these ligands and their receptors are posttranscriptionally controlled by three major groups of regulators; (i) alternative splicing regulatory factors; (ii) turnover and translation regulator RNA-binding proteins (TTR-RBPs); and (iii) non-coding RNAs including miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). In this review, we discuss the influence of these regulators on <b>alternative</b> <b>splicing,</b> <b>mRNA</b> stability and translation. Due to the pathological impacts of insulin system, we also discussed the possibilities of discovering new potential regulators which will improve understanding of insulin system and associated diseases...|$|R
