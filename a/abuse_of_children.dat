Following the associated publicity, some advocates of attachment therapy began to alter views and practices to be less potentially dangerous to children. This change may have been hastened by {{the publication of a}} Task Force Report on the subject in January 2006, commissioned by the American Professional Society on the <b>Abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>Children</b> (APSAC) which was largely critical of attachment therapy, although these practices continue. In April 2007, ATTACh, an organisation originally set up by attachment therapists, formally adopted a White Paper stating its unequivocal opposition to the use of coercive practices in therapy and parenting.|$|E
