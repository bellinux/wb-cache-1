5|$|In 1854, John Rae, while {{surveying}} the Boothia Peninsula for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), discovered {{further evidence of}} the expedition's fate. Rae met an Inuk near Pelly Bay (now Kugaaruk, Nunavut) on 21 April 1854, who told him of a party of 35 to 40white men who had died of starvation near the mouth of the Back River. Other Inuit confirmed this story, which included reports of cannibalism among the dying sailors. The Inuit showed Rae many objects that were identified as having belonged to Franklin and his men. In particular, Rae brought from the Inuit several silver forks <b>and</b> <b>spoons</b> later identified as belonging to Franklin, Fitzjames, Crozier, and Robert Osmer Sargent, a shipmate aboard Erebus. Rae's report was sent to the Admiralty, which in October 1854 urged the HBC to send an expedition down the Back River to search for other signs of Franklin and his men.|$|E

Many of the artefacts are engraved with motifs depicting animals, plants, buildings and human figures. One platter shows {{what appears to}} be a scene of Bellerophon slaying the chimera. Another shows a shepherd watching his flock. Another plate bears the inscription AQVILA ANTONINVS FECIT ("made by Antoninus Aquila").|$|E
25|$|Jones' {{father was}} a Southern Pacific {{railroad}} agent. Young Lindley Jones got his nickname by being so thin that he was compared to a railroad spike. At age 11 {{he got his first}} set of drums. As a teenager he played in bands that he formed himself; Jones' first band was called Spike Jones and his Five Tacks. A railroad restaurant chef taught him how to use pots and pans, forks, knives <b>and</b> <b>spoons</b> as musical instruments. Jones frequently played in theater pit orchestras. In the 1930s he joined the Victor Young orchestra and got many offers to appear on radio shows, including Al Jolson's Lifebuoy Program, Burns and Allen, and Bing Crosby's Kraft Music Hall.|$|E
25|$|Historically, in Alaska, {{hand hook}} and line {{trolling}} {{were used to}} catch king and silver salmon in salt water. This method required minimal gear-boat, lines and hooks—and was used to catch fish that were still feeding in open water before returning to spawn. Trolling was very successful in southeast Alaska and historically the catch {{was used by the}} fresh and mild-cured fish packing industries. Power boats located near feeding grounds conducted most of the trolling. Each boat had four to ten lines, extending from tall poles hung outboard when fishing; each line carried several hooks, with heavy lead sinkers <b>and</b> <b>spoons</b> or baits as lures. Trolling lengthened the fishing season, allowing fishermen to fish in early spring before spawning runs.|$|E

500|$|The {{staple foods}} were {{generally}} consumed around 11 o'clock, {{and consisted of}} bread, lettuce, cheese, fruits, nuts, and cold meat {{left over from the}} dinner the night before. [...] The Roman poet Horace mentions another Roman favorite, the olive, in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: [...] "As for me, olives, endives, and smooth mallows provide sustenance." [...] The family ate together, sitting on stools around a table. Fingers were used to eat solid foods <b>and</b> <b>spoons</b> were used for soups.|$|E
500|$|In {{creating}} {{the interior of}} the house, Burges demonstrated his skill as a jeweller, metalworker and designer. He included some of his best pieces of furniture such as the Zodiac Settle, the Dog Cabinet and the Great Bookcase, the last of which Charles Handley-Read described as [...] "occupying a unique position in the history of Victorian painted furniture". The fittings were as elaborate as the furniture: the tap for one of the guest washstands was {{in the form of a}} bronze bull from whose throat water poured into a sink inlaid with silver fish. Within the Tower House Burges placed some of his finest metalwork; the artist Henry Stacy Marks wrote, [...] "he could design a chalice as well as a cathedral... His decanters, cups, jugs, forks <b>and</b> <b>spoons</b> were designed with an equal ability to that with which he would design a castle." ...|$|E
500|$|The magnificence of the objects, {{both the}} {{personal}} possessions and those items designed to denote {{the authority of}} the dead individual, point to the death of a person connected with the royal court, according to Rupert Bruce-Mitford, who regards the burial as [...] "very likely the monument of the High King or bretwalda Raedwald". [...] Yorke suggests that the treasures buried with the ship reflect the size of the tribute paid to Rædwald by subject kings during his period as bretwalda. Bruce-Mitford has suggested that the inclusion of bowls <b>and</b> <b>spoons</b> amongst the treasures fits with Bede's account of Raedwald's conversion: the spoons may have been a present for a convert from paganism and the bowls had Christian significance. Coins found in the burial have been dated to the approximate date of Rædwald's death. The controversy surrounding the identity of the person for whom the mound was built are reflected in the comments in the article on Rædwald in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography ("It has been argued, more strongly than convincingly, that Rædwald must be the man buried in Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo") and by McClure and Collins, who note that the evidence for Raedwald is [...] "almost non-existent".|$|E

2500|$|The people {{gathered}} {{most of the}} raw materials for tools and building in the area, and obtained others through trade from remote places. Trees nearby provided wood for posts for house walls and stockades, bows and arrow shafts, bowls <b>and</b> <b>spoons,</b> and firewood. Smaller tree branches and grass were used for bedding and roofs. Shells were used to make jewelry, beads, spoons, and digging tools. [...] The people dug river clay which was used to fashion fired pottery. Ornamental and exotic objects, or objects made from foreign materials, are commonly associated with status.|$|E

The scene is covered with detritus: unwashed bowls <b>and</b> <b>spoons</b> with porridge and salad dried on. The everyday items are from the artist's own home, as are the leftovers.

2500|$|During the night, the {{father-in-law}} would {{entertain the}} groom's family, and offer accommodation to them, with the host family sleeping {{on one side}} of the longhouse, and the groom's family living on the other. [...] In the proceeding morning, both families would walk down to the beach front where the groom's canoe is moored. [...] Here the bride's family placed blankets in the canoe. [...] If the bride was of high rank or nobility, blankets would be lined up on the ground from the house to the canoe for the bride to walk on, while two older women led her down. [...] The bride would be dressed in beautiful regalia in colours and ornaments. [...] Over her head another blanket was placed, somewhat like a veil. [...] Behind her would be carried personal belongings, such as things like mats, baskets, blankets, wooden platters, <b>and</b> <b>spoons.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Titus and {{his staff}} {{discovered}} the [...] "inedible" [...] potatoes were delicious after baking in a slow oven. [...] He contracted to purchase as many potatoes as the farmers could produce that were more than two pounds in weight. [...] Soon after the first delivery of [...] "Netted Gem Bakers", they were offered to diners on the North Coast Limited beginning in early 1909. Word of the line's specialty offering traveled quickly, and before long it was using [...] "the Great Big Baked Potato" [...] as a slogan to promote the railroad's passenger service. Hollywood stars were hired to promote it. [...] When an addition was built for the Northern Pacific's Seattle commissary in 1914, a Railway Age reporter wrote, [...] "A large trade mark, {{in the shape of}} a baked potato, 40 ft. long and 18 ft. in diameter, surmounts the roof. The potato is electric lighted and its eyes, through the electric mechanism, are made to wink constantly. [...] A cube of butter thrust into its split top glows intermittently." [...] Premiums such as postcards, letter openers, <b>and</b> <b>spoons</b> were also produced to promote [...] "The Route of the Great Big Baked Potato"; the slogan served the Northern Pacific for about 50 years.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} recorded usage in the Oxford English Dictionary is in {{an article}} of 8 September 1894 featured in The Daily News: [...] "the gentlemen had a turn in the egg-and-spoon race, in which the competitors had to punt {{with one hand and}} balance an egg on a spoon with the other". An earlier origin in colonial USA has been claimed. Egg-and-spoon races formed part of village celebrations of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897, alongside the tug of war and blindfold wheelbarrow races. A set of turned and stained wooden eggs <b>and</b> <b>spoons</b> designed for racing and dating to the 1920s forms part of the Good Time Gallery of the Museum of Childhood in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. It reached Canada by at least 1922, the first time it was mentioned in The Globe. By the 1930s, the phenomenon of the parents' egg-and-spoon race was sufficiently well-established to be satirized in Punch. Races were held among the staff of Trinity College, Cambridge until the 1950s. Egg-and-spoon races were held as part of the celebrations for both the 1977 Silver Jubilee and 2012 Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. [...] In 2012, the British Council promoted the egg-and-spoon race as a suitable event for [...] "English days", alongside the celebration of Charles Dickens and of the Victorian era.|$|E
