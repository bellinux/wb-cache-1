5000|$|In 2001, State Farm and Renaissance jointly formed DaVinci Reinsurance Ltd. in Bermuda, which covered {{more than}} 3.5 million Florida homes in 2010. That same year, Japan-based Tokio Millennium Re Ltd. became an {{approved}} Florida reinsurance vendor.As of 2011, Citizens had cash and investment totaling $11.3 billion and 1.3 million policyholders.The Florida Council of 100 published a position paper in 2010 entitled, [...] "Into the Storm: Framing Florida's Looming Property Insurance Crisis". Chief among problems identified was that Citizens Insurance was undercapitalized and charges [...] "rates {{that are not}} actuarially sound". The {{study also found that}} low-risk property owners were subsidizing high risk policies. They concluded that rates must be based on risk factors, including [...] "geographical location, <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>structure,</b> and construction type". Florida House Bill 1495, passed in 2009, allows Citizens to raise rates gradually over five years to become actuarially sound. This was intended to shift the risk from taxpayers to the private sector. In the spring of 2012, Florida Governor Rick Scott stated in a survey with the Florida Council of 100 that Citizens Insurance had $504.8 billion in risk and just $6.1 billion in cash reserves. PolitiFact Florida, a fact checker of the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald, researched Scott's claims. They concluded that while the company did have $500 billion in exposure, storms would have to damage or destroy every Citizens-insured home in all 67 Florida counties. A [...] "century storm", with a 1% chance of occurring in any year, would generate no more than $21 billion in claims. [...] Regarding the resources available to pay claims, the Citizen's own website states that their [...] "Claims‐Paying Ability" [...] is $19.5 billion. [...] There is a $1.5 billion disparity, prompting the governor to order Citizens to reduce its risk. Barry Gilway was hired on June 18, 2012 as President and Chief Executive Officer of Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, replacing Tom Grady.With 42 years of experience in the insurance industry, he has a reputation as a turnaround specialist.He was keenly aware that his first priority was to shrink the number of Citizens policies. Throughout 2012, Citizens asked 174,000 of its nearly 1.4 million policyholders to move their policies to five private insurers. Approximately 25,000 of that group chose to remain with Citizens, but Florida's consumer insurance advocate Robin Smith Westcott warned that, [...] "For the consumer, there really isn't enough information." [...] The state determined that those five private insurers were financially sound and able to absorb more customers, but issues such as higher premiums, customer responsiveness and number of consumer complaints must be determined by the policyholder. Florida law gives the consumer 30 days from notification to decline their policy transfer before it is assumed by a private firm.|$|E

40|$|Normal {{environmental}} factors induce significant loads to houses during their design life. The majority of damage experienced {{is associated with}} footing movement and is generally caused by moisture related effects brought about by factors such as nearby vegetation and defective plumbing. Serviceability is typically affected by jammed windows and sprung floors, while other forms of damage such as cracking are frequently encountered in non-structural components such as plasterboard and masonry veneer. Correcting a defect requires not only accurate diagnosis of the root cause(s) but also careful selection of the appropriate rectification works since certain traditional techniques have proven costly and ineffective. This paper reports {{on the development of}} a unique database to capture damage information from detailed structural inspections {{of a large number of}} houses in Victoria. Data from 1000 damaged houses are summarised and presented in this paper. The database demonstrates significant trends relating damage to other parameters such as <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>structure,</b> foundation classification, vegetation, and repair costs.

40|$|Corrosion is {{a factor}} that {{decreases}} the ultimate strength of a structure, {{which can lead to}} structural failure in an aged structure. This study proposes a reliable method to predict the ultimate strength reduction caused by pitting corrosion of a structure at various ages. Hence, the objectives of this study are as follows: (1) finding relationship between the ultimate strength reduction and pit depth and (2) finding relationship between the ultimate strength reduction and the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>structure.</b> The presented method has six steps and was assessed by applying it to the simplified example of a thin-plate panel structure. The ultimate strengths of the panel with different pit depths were calculated using finite element analysis. The effects of material and geometric nonlinearities as well as the initial imperfections and buckling were also considered. A linear regression model, representing the relationship between the ultimate strength reduction and pit depth, was then developed. Furthermore, using the experimental data, the weighted mean value of ultimate strength reduction was acquired for different age groups of the panel. The introduced stepwise approach contemplates the nonlinearity of pitting corrosion with time by considering the experimental data. As corroborated by the successful application of the presented methodology, this method is more accurate, compared to the accepted practices available in the literature...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Americans {{perceive}} renters as {{less interested}} and less vested in their residences than owner-occupants. These perceptions stem {{in part from}} historical and current day promotion of the homeownership tenure norm. Although this has achieved its main goal, that of reinforcing owner occupancy as the societal tenure norm, it has also encouraged bias against renters and non-owner occupied dwellings. Maintenance of rental units is ultimately {{the responsibility of the}} owner. One might expect landlords to exert approximately the same amount of upkeep effort towards their rental property investments as they would towards their own residence. Maintaining the homes in good condition would protect their investment from devaluation. The first objective was to determine what pre-established perception, if any, Corvallis residents have of non-owner occupied residences. The second was to identify relationships between the selected characteristics and the exterior condition of single-family residences. The characteristics analyzed were: 1) Tenure (of the residents), 2) Age of the structure, 3) Condition of neighboring residences (Neighborhood Condition), 4) A Maintenance Management Factor and, 5) Proximity of Owner (to the residence). The final objective was to ascertain if renter occupied homes were more likely than owner occupied to possess those predisposing characteristics that make a dwelling more susceptible to decline. Three residential dwelling characteristics were identified as having an influence on the exterior condition of single-family homes in Corvallis. These were Tenure, <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> <b>Structure</b> and Neighborhood Condition. Non-owner occupied residences, older dwellings, and units in poor condition neighborhoods tended to have poor quality exterior conditions themselves. Of the three the only characteristic predisposed to decline linked to rental residences was Tenure. Although the chi-square and ANOVA test results relate neighborhood condition and age to exterior conditions of dwellings, the results also suggest that a rental home is not more likely than an owner occupied home to be older or to be located in a poor condition neighborhood Identification of residential characteristics that predispose a dwelling to decline could benefit renters and owners of rental properties. The outcomes could assist in the development of policies that provide financial support and/or education to owners of homes that possess those characteristics. Renters would benefit if the policies would encourage improved quality of rental dwellings...|$|E

Among the populations of these three species, five types <b>of</b> <b>age</b> <b>structures</b> can be recognized; up to four different types <b>of</b> <b>age</b> <b>structures</b> were found in one species under different environmental or historical conditions and no species showed the same type <b>of</b> <b>age</b> <b>structure</b> throughout its entire range <b>of</b> occurrence.

The changes from one forest type to another follow a unidimensional gradient which begins with climax lodgepole at low elevation, dry sites, followed by a forest mosaic of successional lodgepole and climax spruce-fir at both higher elevations and intermediate moisture sites, and ends with climax spruce-fir in which lodgepole is not pioneer, at both high elevations and on the most mesic sites...|$|R
