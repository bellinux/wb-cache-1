25|$|The <b>achromatic</b> <b>lens,</b> which {{greatly reduced}} color aberrations in {{objective}} lenses and allowed for shorter and more functional telescopes, {{first appeared in}} a 1733 telescope made by Chester Moore Hall, who did not publicize it. John Dollond learned of Hall's invention and began producing telescopes using it in commercial quantities, starting in 1758.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>achromatic</b> refracting <b>lens</b> {{was invented}} in 1733 by an English {{barrister}} named Chester Moore Hall, although it was independently invented and patented by John Dollond around 1758. The design overcame the need for very long focal lengths in refracting telescopes by using an objective made of two pieces of glass with different dispersion, [...] "crown" [...] and [...] "flint glass", to limit the effects of chromatic and spherical aberration. Each side of each piece is ground and polished, and then the two pieces are assembled together. <b>Achromatic</b> <b>lenses</b> are corrected to bring two wavelengths (typically red and blue) into focus in the same plane. The era of the Great refractors in the 19th century saw large <b>achromatic</b> <b>lenses</b> culminating with largest achromatic refractor ever built, the Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900.|$|R
50|$|A non-achromatic {{objective}} is {{an objective lens}} which is not corrected for chromatic aberration. In telescopes they can a be pre-18th century simple single element objective lenses which were used before the invention of doublet <b>achromatic</b> <b>lenses.</b> They can also be specialty monochromatic lenses used in modern research telescopes and other instruments.|$|R
50|$|An erfle is a 5-element {{eyepiece}} {{consisting of}} two <b>achromatic</b> <b>lenses</b> with extra lenses in between. They were invented {{during the first world}} war for military purposes, described in US patent by Heinrich Erfle number 1,478,704 of August 1921 and are a logical extension to wider fields of four element eyepieces such as Plössls.|$|R
25|$|With the {{invention}} of the telescope and microscope {{there was a great deal}} of experimentation with lens shapes in the 17th and early 18th centuries trying to correct chromatic errors seen in lenses. Opticians tried to construct lenses of varying forms of curvature, wrongly assuming errors arose from defects in the spherical figure of their surfaces. Optical theory on refraction and experimentation was showing no single-element lens could bring all colours to a focus. This led to {{the invention}} of the compound <b>achromatic</b> <b>lens</b> by Chester Moore Hall in England in 1733, an invention also claimed by fellow Englishman John Dollond in a 1758 patent.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, {{improvements}} in the size and quality of telescope optics proved a significant advance in observation capability. Most notable among these enhancements was the two-component <b>achromatic</b> <b>lens</b> of the German optician Joseph von Fraunhofer that essentially eliminated coma—an optical effect that can distort {{the outer edge of the}} image. By 1812, Fraunhofer had succeeded in creating an achromatic objective lens [...] in diameter. The size of this primary lens is the main factor in determining the light gathering ability and resolution of a refracting telescope. During the opposition of Mars in 1830, the German astronomers Johann Heinrich Mädler and Wilhelm Beer used a [...] Fraunhofer refracting telescope to launch an extensive study of the planet. They chose a feature located 8° south of the equator as their point of reference. (This was later named the Sinus Meridiani, and it would become the zero meridian of Mars.) During their observations, they established that most of Mars' surface features were permanent, and more precisely determined the planet's rotation period. In 1840, Mädler combined ten years of observations to draw the first map of Mars. Rather than giving names to the various markings, Beer and Mädler simply designated them with letters; thus Meridian Bay (Sinus Meridiani) was feature [...] "a".|$|E
2500|$|The {{first person}} who succeeded in making a {{practical}} achromatic refracting telescope was Chester Moore Hall from Essex, England. He argued that the different humours of the human eye refract rays of light to produce an image on the retina which is free from color, and he reasonably argued {{that it might be}} possible to produce a like result by combining lenses composed of different refracting media. After devoting some time to the inquiry he found that by combining two lenses formed of different kinds of glass, he could make an <b>achromatic</b> <b>lens</b> where the effects of the unequal refractions of two colors of light (red and blue) was corrected. In 1733, he succeeded in constructing telescope lenses which exhibited much reduced chromatic aberration. One of his instruments had an objective measuring [...] with a relatively short focal length of [...]|$|E
50|$|Glasses' Abbe numbers, {{along with}} their mean {{refractive}} indices, {{are used in the}} calculation of the required refractive powers of the elements of <b>achromatic</b> <b>lenses</b> in order to cancel chromatic aberration to first order. Note that these two parameters which enter into the equations for design of achromatic doublets are exactly what is plotted on an Abbe diagram.|$|R
50|$|John Dollond was {{the first}} person to patent the {{achromatic}} doublet. However, it is well known that he was not the first to make <b>achromatic</b> <b>lenses.</b> Optician George Bass, following the instructions of Chester Moore Hall, made and sold such lenses as early as 1733. In the late 1750s, Bass told Dollond about Hall's design; Dollond saw the potential and was able to reproduce them.|$|R
50|$|The magic lantern had not {{advanced}} {{much from}} the 17th century to {{the latter part of}} the 18th century. Childe used <b>achromatic</b> <b>lenses</b> and an improved oil-lamp; and moved to the limelight, then associated with Thomas Drummond. The limelight has also been attributed to Robert Hare, and Goldsworthy Gurney. In Childe's hands, it increased the scale and brightness of the projected images at public performances.|$|R
2500|$|There {{exists a}} point called {{the circle of}} least confusion, where {{chromatic}} aberration can be minimized. It can be further minimized by using an <b>achromatic</b> <b>lens</b> or achromat, in which materials with differing dispersion are assembled {{together to form a}} compound lens. The most common type is an achromatic doublet, with elements made of crown and flint glass. This reduces the amount of chromatic aberration over a certain range of wavelengths, though it does not produce perfect correction. By combining more than two lenses of different composition, the degree of correction can be further increased, as seen in an apochromatic lens or apochromat. Note that [...] "achromat" [...] and [...] "apochromat" [...] refer to the type of correction (2 or 3 wavelengths correctly focused), not the degree (how defocused the other wavelengths are), and an achromat made with sufficiently low dispersion glass can yield significantly better correction than an achromat made with more conventional glass. Similarly, the benefit of apochromats is not simply that they focus 3 wavelengths sharply, but that their error on other wavelength is also quite small.|$|E

50|$|Abbe {{numbers are}} used in the design of <b>achromatic</b> <b>lenses,</b> as their {{reciprocal}} is proportional to dispersion (slope of refractive index versus wavelength) in the wavelength region where the human eye is most sensitive (see graph). For different wavelength regions, or for higher precision in characterizing a system's chromaticity (such as in the design of apochromats), the full dispersion relation (refractive index as a function of wavelength) is used.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a versatile, catheter-type two-photon probe, designed for in vivo and ex vivo imaging of the aqueous outflow pathway in the eye. The device {{consists of a}} silica double cladding fiber used for laser delivery and fluorescence collection, a spiral fiber scanner driven by a miniature piezoelectric tube, and an assembly of three micro-size doublet <b>achromatic</b> <b>lenses</b> used for focusing the laser and collecting the two-photon excitation signal. All the components have a maximum diameter of 2 mm and are enclosed in a length of 12 -gauge stainless steel hypodermic tubing having an outer diameter of 2. 8 mm. The lateral and axial resolutions of the probe are measured to be 1. 5 μm and 9. 2 μm, respectively. Different lens configurations and fibers are evaluated by comparing their spatial resolutions and fluorescence signal collection efficiencies. Doublet <b>achromatic</b> <b>lenses</b> and a double cladding fiber with a high inner cladding numerical aperture are found to produce a high signal collection efficiency, which is essential for imaging live tissues. Simple methods for reducing image distortions are demonstrated. Images of human trabecular meshwork tissue are successfully obtained with this miniature two-photon microscope...|$|R

The preeminence and success of this style in observational astronomy was an era in telescope use in the 19th and early 20th century. Great refractors were large refracting telescopes using <b>achromatic</b> <b>lenses</b> (as opposed to the mirrors of reflecting telescopes). They were often {{the largest in the}} world, or largest in a region. Despite typical designs having smaller apertures than reflectors, Great refractors offered a number of advantages and were favored for astronomy.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{sighting}} telescope seems remarkable, given {{the small size of}} the telescopes on modern instruments. This was likely Newton's choice of a way to reduce chromatic aberrations. Short-focal length telescopes, prior to the development of <b>achromatic</b> <b>lenses,</b> produced an objectionable degree of aberration, so much so that it could affect the perception of a star's position. Long focal lengths were the solution, and this telescope would likely have had both a long-focal length objective lens and a long-focal length eyepiece. This would decrease aberrations without excessive magnification.|$|R

5000|$|The {{instructions}} for the constructions were given by Chester Moore Hall.

[...] They in turn sub-contracted the work to the same person, George Bass.
