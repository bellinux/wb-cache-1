40|$|To my family, Acknowledgements It must be {{the curiosity}} about how things work and the joy of {{learning}} that put me through this fun and fulfilling journey. The journey of my PhD was full of excitement, challenges and learning experiences. The interactions with professors, colleagues, friends and family have been very valuable and I would like thank you <b>all</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> me through my journey. I would like to start with my adviser Roel, who provided {{me an opportunity to}} do research in this world-class group. I am indebted for his trust and support to quite independently carry out my research. I learned from him how to macro manage research activities with a positive attitude. The photonics dinners in his garden and later in the botanic garden were always special evenings.

30|$|The BLCA {{regularly}} organizes {{activities such}} as tree planting, releasing living beings, among other activities. When BLCA organizes tree-planting activities, Master Rurui is able to gather large teams of laypeople to participate. For a tree-planting activity at Qingtai Anyang Garden (QAG), for example, she inspired the laypeople to raise {{a large amount of}} money to support the purchase and maintenance of the trees; for one event in May 2009 alone, the lay people provided RMB 38, 948 Yuan to buy saplings [20]. Trees were planted on each triangle of the QAG to help protect the environment. When the BLCA organizes events to liberate living beings at QAG, Bhiksuni Rurui teaches people the significance of cultivating compassion and loving kindness <b>for</b> <b>all</b> sentient <b>beings,</b> <b>with</b> the aim of promoting peace in human society.|$|R
5000|$|In 1748 the {{government}} issued {{a list of}} men wanted for murders, burglaries and robberies in Sussex {{as well as the}} Custom-house break-in at Poole. The list was published in the London Gazette along with a request for information leading to the arrest of the smugglers. Any informant was promised a royal pardon and as a further encouragement it offered a £50 reward for each smuggler who was captured. Eventually, Thomas Kingsmill; William Fairall, alias Shepherd; Richard Perin, alias Pain, alias Carpenter; Thomas Lillywhite (who married the daughter of Sir Cecil Bishopp, 6th Baronet of Parham Park, see Bishopp baronets); and Richard Glover were <b>all</b> indicted <b>for</b> <b>being</b> concerned, <b>with</b> others, in breaking into the King's Custom-house, at Poole, and stealing thirty hundred weight of tea, value £500 or more. Kingsmill, Fairall and Perrin were found guilty and sentenced to death. [...] Thomas Lillywhite was acquitted and Richard Glover was found guilty, but recommended to mercy by the Jury. Jeremiah Curtis escaped before he could be brought to justice. He went to northern France, joining the Irish Brigade in Gravelines.|$|R
50|$|Paul is a womanizer in {{his early}} twenties who lives in a small Southern town, where he earns a living fixing cars for his uncle. Paul still lives with his mother, Elvira, who works as a clown cheering up {{children}} at the local hospital. He {{spends most of his time}} hanging out with his best friend and self-proclaimed partner-in-crime, Tip, and their friends Bo and Bust-Ass. Among his friends, Paul has a reputation as a ladies' man, but he is not at <b>all</b> known <b>for</b> <b>being</b> involved <b>with</b> long-term relationships; most of Paul's romances last only a few weeks, and he's slept with nearly every girl in town. Paul is beginning to reach a point where he would like to lead a different life, and that feeling becomes all the more clear when he meets Noel, Tip's teenage sister who returns home after attending a boarding school. Noel is more thoughtful and mature than the girls Paul is used to. Paul and Noel soon fall in love, but for Paul this is a different sort of relationship than he's accustomed to — Noel is still a virgin, and her contemplative nature gives him a desire to be a better, stronger person, but Tip does not approve of Paul dating his younger sister, which leads to a rift between these longtime friends.|$|R
2500|$|Rihanna's fifth studio album Loud {{and single}} [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] drew several {{comparisons}} to <b>All</b> <b>for</b> You, with critics noting its sonic transition to an upbeat dance sound from prior release Rated R {{in a similar}} vein to Jackson's contrast from the darker tone of The Velvet Rope. Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine stated, [...] "like Janet's album, Loud is a step away from its über-personal, melodrama-drenched predecessor." [...] Throughout the campaign, Rihanna also evoked Jackson's Velvet Rope era imagery. Ne-Yo's [...] "Say It" [...] was thought to resemble the album's sensual ballads. Record producer Rockwilder revealed Jackson to be his first pop collaboration and an essential part of his career, leading him to work with Christina Aguilera for the singles [...] "Lady Marmalade" [...] and [...] "Dirrty." [...] Rolling Stone likened the production of Aaliyah's self-titled third album to the record. Sal Cinquemani of Slant observed several songs on Usher's 8701 to recall [...] "bona fide Janet Jackson tracks" [...] similar to the album. Christina Milian's debut album was considered to be heavily influenced by the album.

Following <b>All</b> <b>for</b> You <b>being</b> reissued <b>with</b> a Parental Advisory warning and clean edition, Jennifer Lopez's sophomore album J.Lo received a similar treatment by Epic Records, thought to be influenced by Jackson's decision after media emphasis was placed on its explicit language and content.|$|R
40|$|Phosphorous is an {{essential}} element <b>for</b> <b>all</b> living <b>beings</b> <b>with</b> no possible substitute. Phosphorous is a chemical element and is therefore not finite, however the workable findings of phosphorous minerals are. Due to the rapid population growth and depleting phosphorous reserves, there is both an environmental {{as well as an}} economical reason to recover phosphorous. As a step towards sustainability and a lower environmental impact, Eka Chemicals wishes to recover phosphorous from the iron (III) phosphate sludge. The aim of this master thesis is to investigate how a waste stream, rich on iron (III) phosphate, can be utilized and how phosphates can be separated and recycled, at Eka Chemical´s plant in Trollhättan. From this master thesis it can be concluded that removing unwanted substances from the sludge is the only short-term method which has shown enough satisfying recovering results to be a potential method to be implemented on site. However a suitable user has to be found in order for the approach to be successful. Using the sludge as raw material for the manufacturing of snail pesticide is one alternative and using it as fertilizer is another. Both the extraction as well as the method of changing the precipitation is possible alternatives for long-term approaches in order to reach the goal of waste prevention rather than waste treatment. However other factors such as economy also have {{to be taken into account}} when choosing the best alternativ...|$|R
40|$|The study {{focuses on}} the {{clarification}} {{of the concept of}} social integration and its principles in the perspective of the objectives of shaia’h, its primary goals consist of preserving religion, soul, mind, progeny, money and establishment of the security of life through the social integration. The concept of “social integration” is a thought of leading to bring the Islamic society to the origin of Islamic religion which harmonizes with nature of things by virtue of being the religion of nature (Dheen al- Fitrah), also leading to create a broad minded community which generalize the religion of Islam <b>for</b> <b>all</b> races <b>being</b> <b>with</b> different languages, colors and ideologies, until to be isolated the imaginations and fabrications of some extremists and racists about the Islamic religion, that it contains the extremism, racism, intolerance and narrow minded on the color, race, or geographic. And the concept of integration leads to bring the mind set of acceptance of others under the humanitarian circle regardless of religion, sex, color, language according to the sharia’h limitations. Therefore, the concept of social integration between human families is considered as the basic principles of Islam. The study, therefore, has attempted to highlight the relationship between the ‘objectives of the Shari’ah (maqasid al-Shari’ah) and social integration as the latter is an essential component of the social system and its development. The research analyzes the position of Muslim minority of Sri Lanka and the impact effected by them in the sphere of social integration...|$|R
