5|$|The {{so-called}} NatWest Three — Giles Darby, David Bermingham and Gary Mulgrew — were extradited to the United States in 2006 {{on charges}} relating to a transaction with Enron Corporation in 2000 {{while they were}} working for Greenwich NatWest. It {{has been argued that}} the alleged crime was committed by British citizens living in the UK against a British company based in London and therefore, any resulting criminal case falls {{under the jurisdiction of the}} English courts. However, the Serious Fraud Office decided not to prosecute due to lack of evidence. There has been criticism that the <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have to produce a prima facie case, or even a reasonable one, to extradite British citizens, whereas no such facility exists to extradite US citizens to the UK. On 28 November 2007 the three admitted one charge of wire fraud after a plea bargain. On 22 February 2008 they were each sentenced to 37 months in prison.|$|E

It {{has been reported}} that some Hmong Americans, like some other groups of <b>Americans,</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> fully understand American law regarding hunting. In their homeland, the Hmong had a different hunting culture, and most lands were government-owned and therefore open to subsistence hunting, as in other third world countries. Regional officials in Wisconsin and Minnesota have focused on educating Hmong hunters on private property rights to diminish the risk of future conflicts.|$|E
25|$|Today the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of the Census recognizes four races, Native American or American Indian, African American, Asian and White (European American). According to the U.S. government, Hispanic <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{constitute}} a race, {{but rather an}} ethnic group. During the 2000 U.S. Census Whites made up 75.1% of the population with those being Hispanic or Latino constituting the nation's prevalent minority with 12.5% of the population. African Americans made up 12.3% of the total population, 3.6% were Asian American and 0.7% were Native American.|$|E

About 80% thought that the government should do more to curb illegal immigration.|$|E

25|$|As the eTA is {{used for}} the sole purpose of {{immigration}} screening for non-Canadian visitors entering Canada on a temporary basis, all Canadian citizens are automatically barred from applying the eTA. Hence the passport requirement is in place, because a Canadian citizen who travels on a visa-free, non-Canadian passport will be prevented from boarding the commercial flight to Canada unless he or she can present a valid Canadian passport during check-in. The only exceptions to this rule are for a Canadian citizen travelling on a U.S. passport, as <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> need an eTA to enter Canada, or when a Canadian citizen travelling on an eTA-required passport enters Canada by sea or through one of the land ports of entry from the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Study has {{indicated}} that most non-Asian <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> generally differentiate between Asian Americans of different ethnicities. Stereotypes of Chinese Americans and Asian Americans are nearly identical. A 2002 survey of Americans' attitudes toward Asian Americans and Chinese Americans indicated that 24% of the respondents disapprove of intermarriage with an Asian American, second only to African Americans; 23% would be uncomfortable supporting an Asian American presidential candidate, compared to 15% for an African American, 14% for a woman and 11% for a Jew; 17% would be upset if {{a substantial number of}} Asian Americans moved into their neighborhood; 25% had somewhat or very negative attitude toward Chinese Americans in general. The study did find several positive perceptions of Chinese Americans: strong family values (91%); honesty as business people (77%); high value on education (67%).|$|E
25|$|On {{the issue}} of whether most <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> stay put in any one income bracket, Krugman quotes from 2011 CBO {{distribution}} of income study Household income measured over a multi-year period is more equally distributed than income measured over one year, although only modestly so. Given the fairly substantial movement of households across income groups over time, it might seem that income measured {{over a number of years}} should be significantly more equally distributed than income measured over one year. However, much of the movement of households involves changes in income that are large enough to push households into different income groups but not large enough to greatly affect the overall distribution of income. Multi-year income measures also show the same pattern of increasing inequality over time as is observed in annual measures.|$|E

500|$|According to scholar Robert Zecker, {{the novel}} depicts African-American poverty {{but does not}} {{illustrate}} its causes. None of the characters think about how 500,000African-Americans were placed in cramped living areas of only 25 square blocks and the bitterness and rage that stems from such conditions. The African <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> forget the years of oppression they have endured. However, the Greek Americans, like other whites, fail {{to remember that the}} African Americans were assaulted by whites in 1943 and faced over two decades of oppression after that. Instead, Zecker noted that the characters in the novel believe that the 1967 Detroit riots are [...] "inexplicable cataclysms that came out of nowhere".|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} dual citizenship, which {{previously}} had been strongly {{opposed by the}} U.S. government, has become more accepted {{in the years since}} Afroyim. In 1980, the administration of President Jimmy Carter concluded that the Bancroft Treaties—a series of bilateral agreements, formulated between 1868 and 1937, which provided for automatic loss of citizenship upon foreign naturalization of a U.S. citizen—were no longer enforceable, due in part to Afroyim, and gave notice terminating these treaties. [...] In 1990, the State Department adopted new guidelines for evaluating potential loss-of-citizenship cases, under which the government now assumes in almost all situations that <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> in fact intend to give up their citizenship unless they explicitly indicate to U.S. officials that this is their intention. [...] As explained by Peter J. Spiro, [...] "In the long run, Afroyims vision of an absolute right to retain citizenship has been largely, if quietly, vindicated. As a matter of practice, it is now virtually impossible to lose American citizenship without formally and expressly renouncing it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Territories of the United States, such as Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Guam, are not {{entitled}} to electors in presidential elections. Constitutionally, only U.S. states (per [...] ) and Washington, D.C. (per the Twenty-third Amendment) are entitled to electors. Guam has held non-binding straw polls for president since the 1980s {{to draw attention to}} this fact. This means that roughly 4 million <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have the right to vote in presidential elections. Various scholars consequently conclude that the U.S. national-electoral process is not fully democratic.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike most {{markets for}} {{consumer}} {{services in the}} United States, the health care market generally lacks transparent market-based pricing. Patients are typically not able to comparison shop for medical services based on price, as medical service providers do not typically disclose prices prior to service. Government mandated critical care and government insurance programs like Medicare also impact market pricing of U.S. health care. According to the New York Times in 2011, [...] "the United States is {{far and away the}} world leader in medical spending, even though numerous studies have concluded that <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> get better care" [...] and prices are the highest in the world.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2009 pandemic, several studies were conducted to see who received influenza vaccines. [...] These studies show that whites {{are much more likely to}} be vaccinated for seasonal influenza and for the H1N1 strain than African Americans [...] This could be due to several factors. [...] Historically, there has been mistrust of vaccines and of the medical community from African Americans. [...] Many African <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> believe vaccines or doctors to be effective. [...] This mistrust stems from the exploitation of the African American communities during studies like the Tuskegee study. [...] Additionally, vaccines are typically administered in clinics, hospitals, or doctor’s offices. [...] Many people of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to receive vaccinations because they do not have health insurance.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the cent should be eliminated as a unit of currency for several reasons including that many <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> actually spend them, but rather only receive them in change at stores and proceed to return them to a bank for higher denomination currencies, or cash them in at coin counting kiosks. Most modern vending machines do not accept pennies, further diminishing their utility, and the production cost (figured in U.S. Dollars) now exceeds the face value of the coin, caused by increasing inflation. In 2001 and 2006, for example, United States Representative Jim Kolbe (R) of Arizona introduced bills which would have stopped production of pennies (in 2001, the Legal Tender Modernization Act, and in 2006, the Currency Overhaul for an Industrious Nation [...] Act).|$|E
2500|$|One causal {{explanation}} for minority health disparities {{is the social}} selection hypothesis, which holds {{that there is something}} inherent to being in a minority group (e.g., genetics) that makes individuals susceptible to health problems. In general, this view has not been supported by empirical research. [...] If minority individuals were genetically predisposed to poor health outcomes, {{the vast majority of them}} should face health disparities. [...] However, large-scale empirical studies have shown that most of LGB individuals do not suffer psychopathology and that many African <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have heart disease. [...] Instead, research suggests that environmental factors explain minority health disparities better than do genetic factors. While the social selection hypothesis is still debated, it is clear that genetic and dispositional factors do not fully explain the health disparities observed in minority groups.|$|E
2500|$|However, while {{comparing}} the Israel Lobby with the Arab Lobby, Mitchell Bard notes that [...] "From the beginning, the Arab lobby has faced {{not only a}} disadvantage in electoral politics but also in organization. There are several politically oriented groups, {{but many of these}} are one man operations with little financial or popular support." [...] The Arab American Institute is involved in supporting Arab-American political candidates, but, according to award-winning journalist Ray Hanania [...] "it’s nothing compared to the funds that AIPAC raises not just for Jewish American congressmen, but for congressmen who support Israel." [...] Furthermore, Arab American lobbies face a problem of motivation; Jewish Americans feel the need to support their homeland (as well as other states in the Middle East who have signed peace treaties with Israel) in active, organized ways. Arab <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> appear to have a similar motivation {{when it comes to their}} own homelands.|$|E
