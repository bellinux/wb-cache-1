5|$|At the {{juvenile}} stage, a teleost {{looks more like}} its adult form. At this stage, its <b>axial</b> <b>skeleton,</b> internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple, lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish, while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, gobies and flatfishes, the transition is more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult stage, a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like many fish, teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives. Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and largemouth bass living up to 25 years. Rockfish {{appear to be the}} longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years.|$|E
5|$|In soft corals, {{there is}} no stony {{skeleton}} but the tissues are often toughened {{by the presence of}} tiny skeletal elements known as sclerites, which are made from calcium carbonate. Soft corals are very variable in form and most are colonial. A few soft corals are stolonate, but the polyps of most are connected by sheets of coenosarc. In some species this is thick and the polyps are deeply embedded. Some soft corals are encrusting or form lobes. Others are tree-like or whip-like and have a central <b>axial</b> <b>skeleton</b> embedded in the tissue matrix. This is composed either of a fibrous protein called gorgonin or of a calcified material. In both stony and soft corals, the polyps can be retracted, with stony corals relying on their hard skeleton and cnidocytes for defence against predators, with soft corals generally relying on chemical defences in the form of toxic substances present in the tissues known as terpenoids.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} site of {{recurrence}} {{is in the}} vagina; vaginal relapses of endometrial cancer have the best prognosis. If relapse occurs from a cancer {{that has not been}} treated with radiation, EBRT is the first-line treatment and is often successful. If a cancer treated with radiation recurs, pelvic exenteration is the only option for curative treatment. Palliative chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation are also performed. Radiation therapy (VBT and EBRT) for a local vaginal recurrence has a 50% five-year survival rate. Pelvic recurrences are treated with surgery and radiation, and abdominal recurrences are treated with radiation and, if possible, chemotherapy. Other common recurrence sites are the pelvic lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, peritoneum (28% of recurrences), and lungs, though recurrences can also occur in the brain (<1%), liver (7%), adrenal glands (1%), bones (4–7%; typically the <b>axial</b> <b>skeleton),</b> lymph nodes outside the abdomen (0.4–1%), spleen, and muscle/soft tissue (2–6%).|$|E

Samples from two archaeological sites were examined: Rio do Meio (RM) and Porto do Rio Vermelho (SCPRV). Nine aquatic mammal species were found: a) pinnipeds: Arctocephalus australis (Zimmerman, 1783) and A. tropicalis (Gray, 1872), and b) cetaceans: Eubalaena australis (Desmoulins, 1822), Delphinus delphis Linnaeus, 1758, Stenella frontalis (Cuvier, 1829), Steno bredanensis (Lesson, 1828), Tursiops truncatus (Montagu, 1821), Pontoporia blainvillei (Gervais & d'Orbigny, 1844) and a non-identified rorqual from the genus Balaenoptera Lacépède, 1804. Three especies of semi-aquatic mammals were also recorded: Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris (Linnaeus, 1758), Tapirus terrestris (Linnaeus, 1758) and Lontra longicaudis (Olfers, 1818). Both sites presented similar species diversity, although abundance was greater at the most recent site (RM).

25|$|Front limbs are nonexistent in {{all known}} snakes. This {{is caused by}} the {{evolution}} of their Hox genes, controlling limb morphogenesis. The <b>axial</b> <b>skeleton</b> of the snakes’ common ancestor, like most other tetrapods, had regional specializations consisting of cervical (neck), thoracic (chest), lumbar (lower back), sacral (pelvic), and caudal (tail) vertebrae. Early in snake evolution, the Hox gene expression in the <b>axial</b> <b>skeleton</b> responsible {{for the development of the}} thorax became dominant. As a result, the vertebrae anterior to the hindlimb buds (when present) all have the same thoracic-like identity (except from the atlas, axis, and 1–3 neck vertebrae). In other words, most of a snake's skeleton is an extremely extended thorax. Ribs are found exclusively on the thoracic vertebrae. Neck, lumbar and pelvic vertebrae are very reduced in number (only 2–10 lumbar and pelvic vertebrae are present), while only a short tail remains of the caudal vertebrae. However, the tail is still long enough to be of important use in many species, and is modified in some aquatic and tree-dwelling species.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the skeletons of giant non-metamorphosing (GNM) Xenopus laevis tadpoles, which arrest their development indefinitely before metamorphosis, and grow to excessively large sizes {{in the absence}} of detectable thyroid glands. Cartilage growth is isometric; however, chondrocyte size is smaller in GNM tadpoles than in controls. Most cartilages stain weakly with alcian blue, and several cartilages are calcified (unlike controls). However, cartilages subjacent to periosteum-derived bone retain strong affinities for alcian blue, indicating a role for periosteum-derived bone in the retention of glycosaminoglycans during protracted larval growth. Bone formation in the head, limb, and <b>axial</b> <b>skeletons</b> is advanced in comparison with stage-matched controls, but arrests at various mid-metamorphic states. Both dermal and periosteum-derived bones grow to disproportionately large sizes in comparison to controls. Additionally, mature monocuspid teeth form in several GNM tadpoles. Advances in skeletal development are attributable to the old ages and large sizes of these tadpoles, and reveal unexpected developmental potentials of the pre-metamorphic skeleton...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the functions of}} paralogous Hox genes, we compared the phenotypic consequences of altering the embryonic patterns of expression of Hoxb- 8 and Hoxc- 8 in transgenic mice. A comparison of the phenotypic consequences of altered expression of the two paralogs in the <b>axial</b> <b>skeletons</b> of newborns revealed an array of common transformations as well as morphological changes unique to each gene. Divergence of function of the two paralogs was clearly evident in costal derivatives, where increased expression of the two genes affected {{opposite ends of the}} ribs. Many of the morphological consequences of expanding the mesodermal domain and magnitude of expression of either gene were atavistic, inducing the transformation of axial skeletal structures from a modern to an earlier evolutionary form. We propose that regional specialization of the vertebral column has been driven by regionalization of Hox gene function and that a major aspect of this evolutionary progression may have been restriction of Hox gene expression...|$|R
25|$|Not {{only were}} the remains {{recovered}} disarticulated and unassociated, there are glaring morphometric differences in the various components of the holotype and paratype.

First and foremost, the preservation quality of the vertebrae is poor. While the centra are modified, they {{do not appear to}} be truly heterocoelus. The presence of incipient hypapophyses in and of itself might be considered indicative of avian affinity, but their poor development and presence on vertebrae otherwise thoroughly non-avian, is most parsimoniously regarded as mild convergence until further material should be brought to light. The reduction of the neural spines is questionable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Retinoic acid (RA) plays a {{key role}} in pattern {{formation}} along the major body axis and limb formation during vertebrate development. Exposure to excessive retinoic acid (in uterus) generates congenital malformations in limbs, craniofacial, CNS, urogenital, heart, and <b>axial</b> <b>skeletons.</b> In these studies, seven groups of NMRI pregnant mice were administered a single gavage dose of 100 mg /kg body weight; All-trans-retinoic acid dissolved in DMSO at days 9, 10, and 11 of gestation (groups 2, 4, 6), DMSO at days 9, 10, and 11 (groups 1, 3, 5) and left (control group) untreated. Animals were sacrificed at day 18 of gestation via cesarean. Half of the total numbers (n= 115) of fetuses were randomly selected for histological studies, using hematoxylin-eosin methods, and others were used to study the skeletal defects. It was demonstrated that embryonic exposure to RA reveals that on day 9, 37 % of forelimbs and 31 % of hindlimbs have some abnormalities, and on days 10 and 11, 100 % show defects on craniofacial, vertebral column, ribs and limbs...|$|R

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Animals {{can lower}} the {{metabolic}} cost of swimming by using appropriately tuned, elastic springs. Jet-powered invertebrates use springs that lie in functional parallel to their swimming muscles to power half the locomotor cycle. The parallel geometry constrains the spring to be non-linearly elastic; muscle power is diverted {{to load the}} spring only when swimming muscles are not capable of producing maximal hydro-dynamic thrust. The springs of jellyfish and scallops are forced at or near their resonant frequency, producing large energy savings. Measuring the contribution of elastic energy storage to jet-powered locomotion has been facilitated by the relatively simple geometries of invertebrate locomotor systems. In contrast, complex musculoskeletal systems and kinematics have complicated the study of springs in swimming vertebrates. Skins, tendons and <b>axial</b> <b>skeletons</b> of some vertebrate swimmers have appropri-ate mechanical properties to act as springs. To date, though, there exist {{just a handful of}} studies that have investigated the mechanical behaviors of these locomotor structures in swimming vertebrates, and these data have yet to be integrated with measures of swimming power.

These include abundant postcranial and cranial remains of new species belonging to a group of giant extinct lemurs that we have called sloth lemurs due to their remarkable postcranial convergence with arboreal sloths. New fossils have come from a variety of locations in Madagascar, including caves in the Northwest (Anjohibe) and the Ankarana Massif, located in the extreme north, as well as pits in the karstic plains near Toliara in southwestern Madagascar. The most spectacular of these is the extremely deep pit (� 100 m) called Ankilitelo, the “place of the three kily trees. ” These new materials provide insights into the adaptive diversity and evolution of sloth lemurs.

40|$|The Devonian chondrichthyan Phoebodus (Newberry 1889) {{has long}} been known from {{isolated}} teeth recovered {{from a wide variety of}} fossil localities, ranging from the Middle Devonian to the Upper Missippian (Ginter et al. 2010). Here we provide a preliminary report of the first discovery of substantial, partly articulated skeletal and dental remains of a phoebodont, Phoebodus politus, from Famennian outrops of the eastern Anti-Atlas of Morocco. Initial comparisons support the hypothesized close relationship of pheobodonts with the Upper Mississippian chondrichthyan Thrinacodus gracia (Grogan & Lund 2008, Ginter et al. 2010). Both taxa exhibit an anguiliform body and elongate slender cranium. However, P. politus also exhibits dorsal fins with ctenacanth-like fin spines, echoing informal records of similar fin spine and tooth associations from the Famennian of Alaska (Maisey, in Ginter et al. 2010). This Moroccan material represents an important addition to the limited data set of Devonian chondrichthyans. As such, these data will provide a valuable test of recent phylogenetic hypotheses (Pradel et al. 2011; Coates et al. 2017) and addition to analyses of early gathostome diversity and disparity before and after the end Devonian Hangenberg Event (Friedman & Sallan 2012).

Here we examined growth of the <b>axial</b> <b>skeletons</b> of TSK and wild-type(B 6) mice during their period of rapid growth. The whole bodies of mice, 4 - 12 weeks of age, were scanned after sacrifice, by micro-computed tomography (microCT). We reconstructed three-dimensional models of the spine and ribs, and measured vertebral body heights and rib lengths using the Mac-based image-processing software "OsiriX". Although the TSK mice were smaller than the B 6 mice at 4 weeks, they experienced an early growth spurt and by 8 weeks the height, but not the width, of the vertebral body was significantly greater in the TSK mice than the B 6 mice. Measurement of the angles of scoliotic and kyphotic curves post-mortem in the mice was problematic, hence we measured changes that develop in skeletal elements in these disorders. As a marker of kyphosis, we measured anterior wedging of the vertebral bodies; as a marker for scoliosis we measured asymmetries in rib length. We found, unlike in the B 6 mice where the pattern was diffuse, wedging in TSK mice was directly related to spinal level and peaked steeply at the thoracolumbar junction. There was also significant asymmetry in length of the ribs in the TSK mice, but not in the B 6 mice. The TSK mice thus appear to exhibit spinal deformities seen in MFS and could be a useful model for gaining understanding of the mechanisms of development of scoliosis and kyphosis in this disorder...|$|R
40|$|The CCN (Cyr 61 /Ctgf/Nov) {{family of}} matricellular {{proteins}} integrates the extracellular environment with the intracellular environment, with involvement in many cellular {{processes such as}} adhesion, proliferation, mechanical stretch, fibrosis, and more. A large question lurks regarding how these CCNs {{interact with each other}} to regulate many normal physiological events, as well as disease pathogenesis. While CCN 1 and CCN 2 are two of the best-studied CCN family members, it remains elusive whether they have similar roles in endochondral bone formation despite similar patterns of mRNA and protein expression within developing bones. Furthermore, in vivo data have already shown the significance of CCN 2 for endochondral bone formation, but a role for CCN 1 in chondrogenesis has only been shown in vitro. In order to study whether CCN 1 and CCN 2 have overlapping functions in endochondral bone formation, we utilized a collagen II/cartilage-selective deletion of Ccn 1 and/or Ccn 2 to analyze the phenotypes of Ccn 1 and Ccn 2 single and double mutant mice. A generally more severe skeletal phenotype was evident in the double mutant <b>axial</b> <b>skeletons,</b> implying the possibility that CCN 1 and CCN 2 may have overlapping functions. Surprisingly, in the appendicular skeletons there was not a more severe double mutant phenotype but rather a phenotype closely resembling that of Ccn 2 single mutants, indicating that CCN 2 plays a more dominant role within the appendicular skeleton. This supports the new idea that CCN 2 is epistatic to CCN 1. In addition, CCN 1 and CCN 2 may work antagonistically to regulate chondrocyte proliferation in the resting zone of tibial growth plates. Also, a novel phenotype was discovered as the double mutant exhibited increased apoptosis in cells at the perichondrial border. These studies will facilitate the understanding of embryonic bone development and how the proteins CCN 1 and CCN 2 are involved in this process...|$|R
