500|$|Many {{critics have}} {{emphasised}} {{the importance of}} the religious themes in the poem. Vincent Bucklet stated that the Four Quartets [...] "presuppose certain values as necessary for their very structure as poems yet devote that structure to questioning their meaning and relevance. The whole work is, in fact, the most authentic example I know in modern poetry of a satisfying religio-poetic meditation. We sense throughout it is not merely a building-up of an intricate poetic form on the foundation of experiences already over <b>and</b> <b>done</b> <b>with,</b> but a constant energy, an ever-present activity, of thinking and feeling." [...] In his analysis of approaches regarding apocalypse and religious in British poetry, M H Abrams claimed, [...] "Even after a quarter-century, T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets has not lost its status as a strikingly 'modern' poem; its evolving meditations, however, merely play complex variations upon the design and motifs of Romantic representation of the poets educational progress." ...|$|E

[...] An {{example of such a}} recipe is [...] "To à la Daube Pigeons"; a daube is a rich French meat stew from Provence, traditionally made with beef. Her [...] "A Goose à la Mode" [...] is served in a sauce flavoured with red wine, home-made [...] "Catchup", veal sweetbread, truffles, morels, and (more ordinary) mushrooms. She occasionally uses French ingredients; [...] "To make a rich Cake" [...] includes [...] "half a Pint of right French Brandy", as well as the same amount of [...] "Sack" [...] (Spanish sherry).|$|E
500|$|For the [...] "1920s and 1930s-era vibe"-influenced second disc, Aguilera {{teamed up}} with {{longtime}} producer Linda Perry, who produced Aguilera's previous album Stripped. In contrast to the first half disc, the second one consists of all live recordings without using samples (with the exception of [...] "Candyman" [...] featuring a sample of [...] "Tarzan & Jane Swingin' on a Vine"). Recording sessions of the project began in January 2005 and ended in April 2006, taking place at Chalice Recording Studios and The Record Plant in Hollywood, California. [...] All songs from Back to Basics were recorded using Pro Tools HD3 program <b>and</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> a SSL J9000 console with 96 inputs. Aguilera's vocals were recorded using a Telefunken ELAM 251 microphone, possibly in conjunction with an Avalon M-5 pre-amp. Producer Scott Storch, who contributed to Aguilera's previous album Stripped, was asked to return {{for the production of}} Back to Basics. However, he refused the offer when Aguilera declined to pay airfare for him and his entourage to fly out to Los Angeles, which led to a breakdown of their relationship. Subsequently, Aguilera included the song [...] "F.U.S.S." [...] ("Fuck You Scott Storch") on the album, which Storch viewed as [...] "pathetic".|$|E

2500|$|Adolescents who {{regularly}} participated in binge drinking {{for several years}} show a smaller hippocampus brain region, in particular those who began drinking in early adolescence. Heavy binge drinking is associated with neurocognitive deficits of frontal lobe processing and impaired working memory as well as delayed auditory and verbal memory deficits. Animal {{studies suggest that the}} neurodegenerative effects of alcohol abuse during adolescence can be permanent. Research in humans, which utilised sophisticated brain scanning technology suggests that in adolescent teenagers, drinking more than 4 or 5 drinks {{once or twice a month}} results in subtle damage to the teenagers developing brain tissue, in particular the white matter. [...] However, this research is primarily cross-sectional <b>and</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> fairly small sample sizes, making causality less certain.|$|E

The connection between creativity, design and successful innovation practices in {{industry has been}} debated much recently, heightened by realization in academe and governments that 'we need {{a different way of}} thinking <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> if we are to live well and prosper in the future' This paper addresses the question; how to understand more about the relationship of design thinking <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>with</b> learning. It describes research to correlate design knowledge and skill with the pedagogy of skilful practice, thereby supporting pedagogical theory for the design practitioner learner. The research correlates Sennett's review of craftsmanship as skillful thinking <b>and</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>with</b> Dreyfus <b>and</b> dreyfus's model of mental activitiesin the transition of novice to masterful states of skilful practice. It concludes by illustrating the critical transition points to inform educational practice...|$|R
