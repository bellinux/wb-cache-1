5|$|Since {{electrical}} energy cannot easily {{be stored in}} quantities large enough to meet demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required. This requires electricity utilities to make careful predictions of their electrical loads, and maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations. <b>A</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} across {{multiple}} worlds based on Pinocchio, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, , Fantasia and , each having two different plots from {{the perspectives of}} Sora and Riku. These worlds need to be completed by both Sora and Riku in order to unlock new worlds and progress through the game. Upon visiting each world for the first time, each character must go through a Dive section, in which characters freefall down a tube and must clear a certain objective, such as obtaining <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> points, defeating <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> enemies in a time limit, or defeating a boss character. In this mode, Sora and Riku can attack opponents, slow down their descent, or dodge attacks. They can also pick up magic spells which give them a limited supply of magical attacks to use against enemies.|$|E
5|$|Another {{element is}} a {{powerful}} attack substitution that occasionally appears when a character's health is low. Similar features appear in later Final Fantasy titles {{under a variety of}} different names, including Limit Breaks, Desperation Moves, Trances, and Overdrives. Characters are rewarded for victorious battles with experience points and money, called gil (Gold Piece (GP) in the original North American localization). When characters attain <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> experience points, they gain a level, which increases their statistics. An additional player may play during battle scenarios, with control of individual characters assigned from the configuration menu.|$|E

50|$|In {{the view}} of Maimonides, there were certain {{conditions}} similar to interest which were permitted; for example, Maimonides states that a person can offer money to a second person attaching a requirement for the second person to give <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> larger <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> money to a third person, or a requirement for the second person to persuade a third person to lend <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> larger <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> money to the first person. When a non-Jew was involved, Maimonides argues that interest could be charged; indeed, Maimonides argues that it was compulsory to charge interest on loans to non-Jews, but he also suggests that such loans should be restricted to being within narrow limits, to avoid the lender becoming so keen on usury that they practice it against other Jews.|$|R
50|$|His basic {{view is that}} {{happiness}} {{skills can}} be learned.

5|$|Additional game modes are {{available}} to the player in The Age of Kings. One mode, random map, generates a map from one of several randomly chosen map generating scripts, with players starting in the Dark Age with a Town Center, three villagers (or more depending on civilization), and a scout unit. The game can be won through military conquest, by constructing a special building known as a Wonder and keeping it standing for <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time, or by obtaining control of all relics on the map for a set amount of time. Deathmatch mode allows players to begin with large amounts of resources, creating a focus on military dominance, while in the regicide mode each player is given a king unit, winning by killing {{all of the other}} monarchs.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the campaign, Galland {{claimed to}} be {{suffering}} from rheumatism and therefore unfit for flying in open-cockpit aircraft, such as the Hs 123. He tactfully suggested a transfer to a single-engine aircraft type with a closed cockpit would improve his condition. His request was accepted on medical grounds. Galland was removed from his post as a direct ground support pilot. Galland never explained whether open cockpits had caused the complaint or some other cause; given his performance with eye specialists, <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> suspicion is reasonable. He was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27—Fighter Wing 27) on 10 February 1940 as the adjutant, restricting him from flying.|$|E
5|$|Although Chell is {{equipped}} with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling, she can be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} {{a method to}} analyze the effects of water vapor on the pyrolysis products of pulverized coal by using a software Factsage, which is different from existing numerous experimental approach. Water vapor can enhance {{the formation of the}} N-containing compounds NH 3 and HCN, and also improve CO and H 2 yields during pulverized coal pyrolysis, which is helpful to restrain NOx formation during the pulverized coal combustion, because NH 3 and HCN, as CO and H 2, can reduce NOx if the atmosphere is in the condition of deoxidization. However, if it is in the condition of oxidization, they can increase NOx.

5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day is an action-platform {{game where}} the player {{controls}} Conker the Squirrel {{through a series}} of three-dimensional levels. The game features an overworld where players can transition from one level to another, although many are initially blocked off until Conker earns <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> cash. Each level is an enclosed area in which the player can freely explore to find tasks to do. The gameplay mostly relies on figuring out a way to help other characters by completing a linear sequence of challenges. These challenges may include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, gathering objects, and racing opponents, among others. The result is always a cash reward, which aids access to other areas in the overworld.|$|E
5|$|In {{choosing}} the SEC opponent, the Chick-fil-A Bowl selection committee {{had the right}} to select the first SEC school after the Bowl Championship Series, Cotton Bowl Classic, Capital One Bowl, and Outback Bowl made their selections. Just as in the ACC, the selection committee could not select an SEC team with two more losses than the highest available team. The bowl earned the right to select these teams via its multimillion-dollar payout system, which guarantees <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> money to the participating conferences. Prior to 2006, the Chick-fil-A Bowl (then known as the Peach Bowl) matched the No.5 team in the SEC versus the No.3 team in the ACC. After the bowl increased its payout to $2.8million per squad, it then was given the second pick from the ACC, with the Gator Bowl dropping to third.|$|E
5|$|In the game's single-player mode, {{the player}} must explore a galaxy that is {{composed}} of 15 nonlinear worlds. Each world {{is composed of}} a series of stages with areas interconnected by different types of doors. Most doors open automatically, but some require a special action to be unlocked. For example, some doors require the player to defeat all the enemies in the area, while others may require a specific key. Although the player has <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> health which decreases when attacked by enemies, health-recovery gems and ammunition crates can be collected throughout the world to increase the player's resources. Power-ups can also be found to expand the player's health and ammunition capacity.|$|E

5|$|In the game, players fight various monsters as they {{explore the}} pyramid's halls and catacombs. Players may pick up weapons and {{ammunition}} {{left behind by}} others to supplement their arsenal. As additional levels are unlocked, new weapons become available, including machine guns and grenade launchers. Players can absorb <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> damage, but once their health reaches zero, they must resume their progress at the last saved checkpoint. Resting in place replenishes health but saps game time and leaves the player open to attack. Scattered throughout the levels are other items players may use. Potions have different effects: rare blue potions, for example, rid the player character of poison and damage. Otherwise items provide points or cash; every four points increases the player character's maximum health by two units. Crystals can be used against enemies to freeze, burn, or otherwise harm them.|$|E
5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries {{information}} about a protein sequence to the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell. It is coded so that every three nucleotides (a codon) corresponds to one amino acid. In eukaryotic cells, once precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA. This removes its introns—non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA. The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form {{with the help of}} tRNA. In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA. After <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance of ribonucleases.|$|E
