The facility produced the desired driver gas pressures repeatedly to within 0. 31 % at low-duty-cycle of 6 seconds. The driven gas pressure profiles within the test-section suggest that shock waves may be forming within test section for a driver gas pressure of 200 psig and above, which corresponds to shock wave Mach numbers of 1. 7 to 2. 0.

40|$|Hypersonic vehicle {{development}} {{is an important}} problem of current national interest. Many of the key challenges, such as heat flux, are beyond our current predictive capability. Hence, experimentation is required to help build knowledge and provide validation for new modeling.

Hypervelocity expansion tunnels, which use unsteady shock and expansion processes to introduce enthalpy and kinetic energy into gaseous flows, offer a unique and brief view into true flight-like environments.

40|$|Our {{research}} and technology {{are focused on}} nonlinear issues in the <b>aerothermochemistry</b> of gases and materials and the associated physics and dynamics of interfaces. Our program is now organized to aggressively support the NASA Aeronautics Enterprise so as to: (a) develop {{a new generation of}} environmentally compatible, economic subsonic aircraft; (b) develop the technology base for an economically viable and environmentally compatible high-speed civil transport; (c) develop the technology options for new capabilities in high-performance aircraft; (d) develop hypersonic technologies for air-breathing flight; and (e) develop advanced concepts, understanding of physical phenomena, and theoretical, experimental, and computational tools for advanced aerospace systems. The implications from our research for aeronautical and aerospace technology have been both broad and deep. For example, using advanced computational techniques, we have determined exact solutions for the Schrodinger equation in electron-molecule scattering allowing us to evaluate atmospheric models important to reentry physics. We have also found a new class of exact solutions for the Navier Stokes equations. In experimental fluid dynamics, we have found explicit evidence of turbulence modification of droplet sizes in shock tube flow with condensation. We have developed a new diagnostic tool for the direct estimation of flow velocities at MHz sampling rates in quasi-one dimensional turbulent flow. This procedure suggests an unexpected confirmation of the possibility of 'natural' closure in Reynolds stresses with deep implications for the development of turbulent models. A transient increase is observed in both the spectral energy decay rate and the degree of chaotic complexity at the interface of a shock wave and a turbulent ionized gas. Even though the gas is apparently brought to rest by the shock wave, no evidence is found either of the expected relaminarization. A unique diamond-shaped nozzle has been designed for a detailed investigation of the effect of significant streamwise vorticity on the acoustic and IR characteristics of supersonic jets. Our results provide convincing evidence of the significant effect of vorticity on the far-field noise for the diamond jet as compared to the conventional round jets. We have found that the countercurrent shear layer mixes much more efficiently than conventional coflowing shear layers. We also developed the fluid thrust vectoring procedures which use counter flow to vector a jet. Our materials research has shown that the steep stress gradients at the fiber-matrix interface could be the primary cause of interface cracks after the processing of metallic and intermetallic matrix composites. New techniques have been evolved for: the microcharacterization of materials including microplastic strain and, point by point, the misorientation and plasticity for matrix composites; thermally induced stress measurements and load relaxation; the growth and characterization of metallic matrix composite interfaces; and for the growth of ferrite materials by pulsed laser deposition.

40|$|The project {{focuses on}} {{diatomic}} gases with vibrational and electronic mode disequilibrium, environments commonly {{encountered in the}} shock layer of spacecrafts while re-entering into earth atmosphere. The known-how gained during former aerospace missions allows for the key role of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations {{in the development of}} hypersonic applications to be highlighted in strong interaction with ground testing. The relevance of these simulations is linked to <b>aerothermochemistry</b> features such as high-temperature gas effects in hypersonic flows. For instance, the design of the heat shield used to protect spacecraft is based on the estimation of the heat fluxes to the vehicle surface by means of experimental and numerical resources. CFD predictions of these quantities strongly rely upon the accuracy of the model used to describe the flow. During the entry of a spacecraft into a planetary atmosphere, the translational energy of the fluid particles rises through the shock. A high number of collisions is then needed to equilibrate the internal energy modes (electronic for atoms; rotational, vibrational, and electronic for molecules) with the translational one. Hence, these modes turn out to be in nonequilibrium at the convective time scale. In addition, particles dissociate, recombine, and ionize in the shock-layer, the flow is found to be in chemical nonequilibrium. The prediction of the heat fluxes strongly depends on the completeness and accuracy of the physical model used to describe thermo-chemical nonequilibrium phenomena. There is thus a critical need to develop an accurate model for the Lunar and Martian return missions. In this manucript, we present a finite rate chemistry mechanism to determine the species concentration. The rotational mode is considered in equilibrium with the translational mode. Vibrational energy and free electron kinetic energy equations deal with thermal nonequilibrium. Radiative heating can approach and possibly exceed the level of convective heating that results from the frictional flow of the atmosphere over the thermal protection material. This situation occurs during Earth's reentries at given the large amount of radiators produced in the shock layer at hypervelocity ($ v > 10 $ km/s). Radiation modeling involves the determination of population distributions over the internal energy levels and of the radiative contribution of each of these levels. In flight conditions, the electronic energy level populations are expected to depart from equilibrium. We will resort here to a hybrid collisional-radiative/Boltzmann model. The model adopted, combines an electronic collisional-radiative model to determine the population of the electronic energy levels by solving a system of rate equations and Boltzmann distributions for the rotational and vibrational energy level populations. One-dimensional shock-tube and nozzle flow solvers have been developed in order to validate the models. The models have been assessed by means of comparison between the computed results and data obtained by hypervelocity demonstrators and shock-tube experiments representative of flight conditions. The detailed CR model employed for the analysis of nonequilibrium flows in compressing as well as expanding situations {{has been used as a}} baseline to create a new reduced kinetic mechanisms for air flow conditions typical of reentry applications. The number of electronic levels of atoms and molecules considered in the model has been reduced by grouping similar energy levels. This allowed us to extend the use of the CR model for 2 and 3 D computational fluid dynamic simulations. The final part of the thesis is devoted to the implementation of the simplified model in multidimensional (2 D and 3 D) solver for re-entry application, which allows to simulate the flowfield surrounding a space vehicle while reentering into earth atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|The present {{dissertation}} aims at {{bringing a}} further scientific {{contribution to the}} knowledge on oxygenated fuels properties and their ability of reducing mainly soot emissions in diesel engine combustion. The activity comprises two different phases. The first phase has been conducted at Istituto Motori, Italian National Research Council in Naples and focused on comparing performance and engine out emissions from conventional diesel and alternative fuels. The second part of this study has been, instead, carried on at the <b>Aerothermochemistry</b> and Combustion Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Different oxygenated fuels have been investigated in a constant volume chamber with large optical access. In particular Poly(oxymethylene) dimethyl ethers (POMDME) with a CH 3 -O-(CH 2 -O) n-CH 3 general molecular structure have been studied both in the constant volume chamber and a single cylinder “heavy duty” diesel engine. The use of oxygenated fuels or biodiesel from renewable sources in diesel engines {{is of particular interest}} because of the low environmental impact that can be achieved. The experimental investigation performed at Istituto Motori has provided results from a light duty diesel engine fueled with biodiesel, gasoline and butanol mixed, at different volume fractions, with mineral diesel. The investigation has been performed on a turbocharged DI four cylinder diesel engine for automotive applications equipped with a common rail injection system. Engine tests have been carried out at 2500 rpm, 0. 8 MPa of brake mean effective pressure selecting a single injection strategy and performing a parametric analysis on the effect of combustion phasing and oxygen concentration at intake on engine performance and exhaust emissions. The experiments demonstrated that the fuel properties have a strong impact on soot emissions. Blends composed of diesel-gasoline or diesel-butanol determined the maximum reduction in smoke emissions compared to the diesel fuel. No significant difference for NOx emissions was found between the investigated fuels highlighting that oxygen availability within the fuel may not produce an increase in NOX formation under late premixed combustion. Moreover, oxygenated fuels produced from methane-based products have been investigated at the ETH, Zurich. The different oxygenated fuels were investigated in a constant volume chamber with large optical accesses. In order to study the combustion evolution and soot formation and oxidation processes, optical techniques such as OH chemiluminescence and two dimensional two colour pyrometry (2 D 2 CP) have been applied. Moreover, a fast particle spectrometer has been used at the chamber exhaust in order to analyse the soot emissions from the different investigated fuels. The investigation included the calculation of the kL factor, demonstrating a reduction of the soot formation dominated phase when increasing the oxygenated fraction in the blend. Moreover, fuel jet images show a reduction of the soot formation area when increasing the oxygen content in the blend. The activity even focused on the analysis of soot emissions acquired by means of the fast particle spectrometer and results highlighted nearly smokeless combustion for pure oxygenated fuels and a non-linear soot emission reduction with increasing O 2 content in the blend. In order to achieve a complete overview of the impact of oxygenated fuels on engine performance and exhaust emissions, a second investigation on a single cylinder “heavy duty” direct injection diesel engine has been performed. The comparison between the POMDME-diesel blends and conventional diesel has shown a significant reduction in soot emissions, up to almost 35 % reduction with the 10 % POMDME in diesel blend. Moreover no significant increase in NOx emissions was found when fueling the engine with the blends, highlighting as molecular oxygen is not crucial (at least in the percentages investigated in the present dissertation) for NOX increase even in a premixed plus diffusive combustion mode. The first introductory chapter of this thesis contains an overview of the problems connected to exhaust emissions from diesel engines, describes the most promising in-cylinder emission reduction techniques and illustrates the after-treatment systems that are nowadays necessary to fulfill the increasingly stricter emission regulations. The second chapter, instead, focuses on the different adopted experimental set-up and describes the applied optical techniques while results of the different activities are presented in chapter three. Finally, conclusion and outlook are reported in chapter four...|$|E
40|$|The {{re-entry}} {{space vehicles}} encounter high temperatures {{when they enter}} the earth atmosphere and the high temperature air in the shock layer around the body undergoes partial dissociation. Also, the gas molecules injected into the shock layer from the ablative thermal protection system (TPS) undergo pyrolysis which helps in reducing the net heat flux to the vehicle surface. The chemical species due to the pyrolysis add complexity to the stagnation flow chemistry (52 chemical reactions) models which include species like NOx, CO and hydrocarbons (HCs). Although the ablative TPS {{is responsible for the}} safety of re-entry space vehicle, the induced chemical species result in variety of adverse effects on environment such as global warming, acid rain, green house effect etc. The well known three-way-catalyst (TWC) involves simultaneous removal of all the three gases (i. e, NOx, CO, Hydrocarbons) present in the shock layer. Interaction of such three-way-catalyst on the heat shield materials or {{on the wall of the}} re-entry space vehicle is to reduce the heat flux and to remove the gases in the shock layer, which is an important issue. For the re-entry vehicle the maximum aerodynamic heating occurs at an altitude ranging about 68 to 45 km during which the vehicle is surrounded by high temperature dissociated air. Then the simplest real gas model of air is the five species model which is based on N 2, O 2, O, NO and N. This five species model assumes no ionization and no pyrolysis gases are emitted from the heat shield materials. The experimental research work presented in this thesis is directed towards the understanding of catalytic and non-catalytic surface reactions on high temperature materials in presence of strong shock heated test gas. We have also explored the possibility of using shock tube as a high enthalpy device for synthesis of new materials. In the first Chapter, we have presented an overview of re-entry space vehicles, thermal protection system (TPS) and importance of real gas effects in the shock layer. Literature survey on TPS, ablative materials and <b>aerothermochemistry</b> at the stagnation point of reentry capsule, in addition to catalytic and non-catalytic surface reactions between the wall and dissociated air in the shock layer are presented. In Chapters 2 and 3, we present the experimental techniques used to study surface reactions on high temperature materials. A brief description of HST 2 shock tunnel is presented and this shock tunnel is capable of generating flow stagnation enthalpies ranging from 0. 7 to 5 MJ/kg and has an effective test time of ~ 800 µs. High speed data acquisition system (National Instruments and Yokogawa) used to acquire data from shock tube experiments. The experimental methods like X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman and FTIR spectroscopy have been used to characterize the shock-exposed materials. Preliminary research work on surface nitridation of pure metals with shock heated nitrogen gas is discussed in Chapter 2. Surface nitridation of pure Al thin film with shock heated N 2 is presented in Chapter 3. An XPS study shows that Al 2 p peak at 74. 2 eV is due to the formation AlN on the surface of Al thin film due to heterogeneous non-catalytic surface reaction. SEM results show changes in surface morphology of AlN film due to shock wave interaction. Thickness of AlN film on the surface increased with the increase in temperature of the shock heated nitrogen gas. However, HST 2 did not produce sufficient temperature and pressure to carry out real conditions of re-entry. Therefore design and development of a new high enthalpy shock tunnel was taken up. In Chapter 4, we present the details of design and fabrication of free piston driven shock tunnel (FPST) to generate high enthalpy test gas along with the development of platinum (Pt) and thermocouple sensors for heat transfer measurement. A free piston driven shock tunnel consists of a high pressure gas reservoir, compression tube, shock tube, nozzle, test section and dump tank connected to a vacuum pumping system. Compression tube has a provision to fill helium gas and four ports, used to mount optical sensors to monitor the piston speed and pressure transducer to record pressure at the end of the compression tube when the piston is launched. Piston can attain a maximum speed of 150 m/s and compress the gas inside the compression tube. The compressed gas bursts the metal diaphragm and generates strong shock wave in the shock tube. This tunnel produces total pressure of about 300 bar and temperature of about 6000 K and is capable of producing a stagnation enthalpy up to 45 MJ/kg. The calibration of nozzle was carried out by measuring the pitot tube pressure in the dump tank. Experimentally recorded P 5 pressure at end of the shock tube is compared with Numerical codes. Calibrated pressure P 5 values are used to calculate the temperature T 5 of the reflected shock waves. This high pressure and high temperature shock heated test gas interacts with the surface of the high temperature test materials. For the measurement of heat transfer rate, platinum thin film sensors are developed using DC magnetron sputtering unit. Hard protective layer of aluminum nitride (AlN) on Pt thin film was deposited by reactive DC magnetron sputtering to measure heat transfer rate in high enthalpy tunnel. After the calibration studies, FPST is used to study the heat transfer rate and to investigate catalytic/non-catalytic surface reaction on high temperature materials. In Chapter 5, an experimental investigation of non-catalytic surface reactions on pure carbon material is presented. The pure carbon C 60 films and conducting carbon films are deposited on Macor substrate in the laboratory to perform shock tube experiments. These carbon films were exposed to strong shock heated N 2 gas in the shock tube portion of the FPST tunnel. The typical shock Mach number obtained is about 7 with the corresponding pressure and temperature jumps of about 110 bar and 5400 K after reflection at end of the shock tube. Shock exposed carbon films were examined by different experimental techniques. XPS spectra of C(1 s) peak at 285. 8 eV is attributed to sp 2 (C=N) and 287. 3 eV peak is attributed to sp 3 (C-N) bond in CNx due to carbon nitride. Similarly, N(1 s) core level peak at 398. 6 eV and 400. 1 eV observed are attributed to sp 3 -C-N and sp 2 -C=N of carbon nitride, respectively. SEM study shows the formation of carbon nitride crystals. Carbon C 60 had melted and undergone non-catalytic surface reaction with N 2 while forming carbon nitride. Similar observations were made with conducting carbon films but the crystals were spherical in shape. Micro Raman and FTIR study gave further evidence on the formation of carbon nitride film. This experimental investigation confirms the formation of carbon nitride in presence of shock-heated nitrogen gas by non-catalytic surface reaction. In Chapters 6 and 7, we present a novel method to understand fully catalytic surface reactions after exposure to shock heated N 2, O 2 and Ar test gas with high temperature materials. We have employed nano ZrO 2 and nano Ce 0. 5 Zr 0. 5 O 2 ceramic high temperature materials to investigate surface catalytic reactions in presence of shock heated test gases. These nano crystalline oxides are synthesized by a single step solution combustion method. Catalytic reaction was confirmed for both powder and film samples of ZrO 2. As per the theoretical model, it is known that the catalytic recombination reaction produces maximum heating on the surface of re-entry space vehicles. This was demonstrated in this experiment when a metastable cubic ZrO 2 changed to stable monoclinic ZrO 2 phase after exposure to shock waves. The change of crystal structure was seen using XRD studies and needle type monoclinic crystal growth with aspect ratio (L/D) more than 15 was confirmed by SEM studies. XPS of Zr(3 d) core level spectra show no change in binding energy before and after exposure to shock waves, confirming that ZrO 2 does not change its chemical nature, which is the signature of catalytic surface reaction. When a shock heated argon gas interacted with Ce 0. 5 Zr 0. 5 O 2 compound, there was a change in colour from pale yellow to black due to reduction of the compound, which is the effect of heat transfer from the shock wave to the compound in presence of argon gas. The reduction reaction shows the release of oxygen from the compound due to high temperature interaction. The XPS of Ce(3 d) and Zr(3 d) spectra confirm the reduction of both Ce and Zr to lower valent states. The oxygen storage and release capacity of the Ce 0. 5 Zr 0. 5 O 2 compound was confirmed by analyzing the reduction of Ce 4 + and Zr 4 + with high temperature gas interaction. When Ce 0. 5 Zr 0. 5 O 2 (which is same as Ce 2 Zr 2 O 8) in cubic fluorite structure was subjected to strong shock, it changed to pyrochlore (Ce 2 Zr 2 O 7) structure by releasing oxygen and on further heating it changed to Ce 2 Zr 2 O 6. 3 which is also crystallized in pyrochlore structure by further releasing oxygen. If this heating is carried out in presence of argon test gas, fluorite structure can easily change to pyrochlore Ce 2 Zr 2 O 6. 3 structure, which is a good electrical conductor. Due to its oxygen storage capability (OSC) and redox (Ce 4 +/Ce 3 +) properties, Ce 0. 5 Zr 0. 5 O 2 had been used as oxygen storage material in three-way-catalyst. Importance of these reactions is that the O 2 gas released from the compound will react with gas released from the heat shield materials, like NOx, CO and hydrocarbon (HCs) species which results in reduction of temperature in the shock layer of the re-entry space vehicle. The compound Ce 0. 5 Zr 0. 5 O 2 changes its crystal structure from fluorite to pyrochlore phase in presence of shock heated test gas. The results presented in these two Chapters are first of their kind, which demonstrates the surface catalytic reactions. In Chapter 8, we present preliminary results of the oxygen recombination on the surface of heat shield material procured from Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) used as TPS in re-entry space capsule (Space capsule Recovery Experiment SRE- 1) and on thin film SiO 2 deposited on silicon substrate. The formation of SiO between the junctions of SiO 2 /Si was confirmed using XPS study when shock exposed oxygen reacted on these materials. The surface morphology of the ablated SiO 2 film was studied using SEM. The damage induced due to impact of shock wave in presence of oxygen gas was analyzed using Focused Ion Beam (FIB) microscope. The results reveal the damage on the surface of SiO 2 film and also in the cross-section of the film. We are further investigating use of FIB, particularly related to residual stress developed on thin films due to high pressure and high temperature shock wave interaction. In Chapter 9, conclusions on the performance of FPST, synthesis of high temperature materials, catalytic and non-catalytic surface reactions on the high temperature material due to shock-heated test gases are presented. Possible scope for future studies is also addressed in this Chapter...|$|E
