5000|$|Because of its size, soaring price tag, {{and what}} critics {{see as a}} gaudy interior, Champ d'Or has been {{depicted}} {{as one of the}} region's most <b>glaring</b> <b>displays</b> of wealth-driven foppery. In April 2009, D Magazine named the property [...] "The Biggest Little Teardown in Texas", scathingly writing:In the distance, you’ll see something so huge and so incongruous in its French-baroque-meets-Plano-McMansion mashup that it seems more hallucination than house.The chateau's ornate design, including marble floors, gold plated elevator, and hand-carved spiral staircase did not appeal to prospective buyers for several years. The house passed from listing agent to listing agent, from 2003-2009, with no serious offers.|$|R
2500|$|There {{has been}} a <b>glaring,</b> unfortunate, <b>display</b> of incompetent {{strategic}} leadership within our national leaders. As a Japanese proverb says, [...] "Action without vision is a nightmare." [...] There {{is no question that}} America is living a nightmare with no end in sight.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, {{developing}} countries such as India have been exhibiting rapid increase in human population and vehicles, and increase in road accidents. Inappropriate driving behaviour {{is considered one of}} the major causes of road accidents in India as compared to defective geometric design of pavement or mechanical defects in vehicles. Apart from the other factors causing accidents such as poor road design,vehicle conditions, driver characteristics of frequent traffic violations, increase in crashes due to self-centred driving, etc. it can also be resulted in conditions such as lack of psychophysical abilities e. g. poor eye sight, poor vision at night time, glare blindness etc. Hence, improved driver screening facilities accompanied by availability of good driving aids such as <b>anti</b> <b>glare</b> glasses can be an effective and preventive measure to inhibit crash risks. This article is based on a case study jointly done by CSIR-Central Road Research Institute and Institute of Driver Training & Research, Maruti, Loni Border, Delhi, India to highlight visual limitations among the learner drivers which can influence (as per the literature review) driving behaviour with crash chances, which can be reduced through improving safety accompanied with better driver screening, providing free visual aids and modifying present licensing procedures...|$|R

60|$|While Solomon was speaking, old John sat, mute as a stock-fish, {{staring at}} him with an unearthly <b>glare,</b> and <b>displaying,</b> by every {{possible}} symptom, entire and complete unconsciousness. But when Solomon was silent again, John followed with his great round eyes {{the direction of his}} looks, and did appear to have some dawning distant notion that somebody had come to see him.|$|R
50|$|Commercialization of SPD is {{accelerating}} in {{the automotive}} industry. SPD automotive side and rear windows and sunroofs offer many benefits to passengers in the vehicle. Because of their fast-switching {{and ability to}} be tuned, they reduce unwanted light and glare, which allows users to maintain their views of the outside while reducing <b>glare</b> on <b>displays</b> and video screens, or tint the windows for additional privacy. SPD automotive glass also minimizes heat build-up inside the vehicle because {{of their ability to}} block solar heat gain. Many SPD window systems automatically switch to their maximum heat-blocking state when the vehicle is not in use.|$|R
30|$|The {{test was}} carried out during the daytime, fixing the {{environment}} as follows. Ceiling fluorescent lights were switched on. And by adjusting window shades, {{the brightness of the}} visual contact target material was kept 320 – 380  lx. We found that the reduced <b>glare</b> on the <b>display</b> accounted for less eye fatigue [9] with no reflection produced on the visual contact target material.|$|R
5000|$|There {{has been}} a <b>glaring,</b> unfortunate, <b>display</b> of incompetent {{strategic}} leadership within our national leaders. As a Japanese proverb says, [...] "Action without vision is a nightmare." [...] There {{is no question that}} America is living a nightmare with no end in sight.Since 2003, the politics of war have been characterized by partisanship as the Republican and Democratic parties struggled for power in Washington. National efforts to date have been corrupted by partisan politics that have prevented us from devising effective, executable, supportable solutions. At times, these partisan struggles have led to political decisions that endangered the lives of our sons and daughters on the battlefield. The unmistakable message was that political power had a greater priority than our national security objectives. Overcoming this strategic failure {{is the first step toward}} achieving victory in Iraq [...] - [...] without bipartisan cooperation we are doomed to fail. There is nothing going on in Washington that would give us hope.|$|R
5000|$|Uplighting is less common, {{often used}} to bounce {{indirect}} light off the ceiling and back down. It is commonly used in lighting applications that require minimal glare and uniform general illuminance levels. Uplighting (indirect) uses a diffuse surface to reflect light in a space and can minimize disabling <b>glare</b> on computer <b>displays</b> and other dark glossy surfaces. It gives a more uniform presentation of the light output in operation. However indirect lighting is completely reliant upon the reflectance value of the surface. While indirect lighting can create a diffused and shadow free light effect it {{can be regarded as}} an uneconomical lighting principle.|$|R
5000|$|In many cases, {{frequent}} {{computer users}} suffer from computer vision syndrome, {{which is a}} degenerative eye problem which can result in severely reduced eyesight (Myopia), blurred vision, overall eye tiredness and even Glaucoma. Computer Eye Syndrome is an umbrella term for many problems but the causes of these problems can be easily identified. When using a computer due to the size and setup of the monitor and components {{it is necessary for}} the user to be within at least two feet of the monitor when performing any type of computational work. This presents many problems especially in older monitors due to an elevated amount of monitor <b>glare,</b> poor <b>display</b> quality and insufficient picture display refresh rates. Although these problems are more evident in older computers the newer models are not free from these problems either. Studies have been conducted [...] They state “Treatment requires a multidirectional approach combining ocular therapy with adjustment of the workstation” which shows these problems are quite easily solved with minimal investment from computer manufacturers through producing higher quality monitors with better resolution and refresh rates. The most common form of Computer Vision Syndrome is a condition termed Dry Eye, which results in itchy, sore and even the illusion that something is stuck in your eye. This condition is often caused by extensively long period looking at a computer screen.|$|R
5000|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Shelf in the Room", {{directed}} by Sean Mullens, bears the rural and color aesthetics {{depicted in the}} album art of Days of the New. It focuses on a troubled adolescent boy, likely a reflection of Days of the New frontman Travis Meeks. He is first seen <b>glaring</b> through the <b>display</b> window of an antique store before shattering it with his fists. The store owner comes out to yell at the boy who carelessly leaves. He is then shouted at by {{a man on the}} street and barked at by a dog, all of whom appear in a motion blur. Later on, the boy is surrounded by older kids who begin taunting him. He is chased out of town and into the woods where he finds solace in a small wooden building. While appearing no bigger than an outhouse from its exterior, inside is a large empty room. The boy places items he has obtained, including a set of old keys, a dead bird's feather, and shards of glass, on a shelf. He then sits curled up on a chair {{in the middle of the}} room.|$|R
5000|$|The G Flex's {{physical}} design {{resembles that}} of the LG G2, consisting of a polycarbonate shell with a curvature of 700 millimetres (28 in), with volume and power buttons located on {{the rear of the}} device directly below the camera—the power button also contains an LED lamp which {{can be used as a}} notification light. The rear casing of the G Flex carries a [...] "brushed metal" [...] look and features a [...] "self-healing" [...] coating which can repair minor scratches and abrasions made to it. LG claimed that the curved design would be more [...] "natural" [...] when held to the head for conducting phone calls, and would reduce the level of <b>glare</b> on the <b>display.</b> While the phone can withstand being bent—having been being bent a hundred times with 88 pounds (40 kg) of pressure during internal testing without any permanent damage to its form, LG chose to maintain a level of rigidity to the G Flex's design in order to ensure a [...] "premium" [...] feel. The G Flex's internal hardware is almost identical to the G2, with a 2.26 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor with 2 GB of RAM, support for LTE or LTE Advanced networks where available, 32 GB of internal storage, and an infrared emitter. Unlike the G2, however, the G Flex's display is a 6-inch (15 cm), 720p, flexible OLED display coated with Gorilla Glass, and it also incorporates a non-removable 3500 mAh battery specifically optimized for the G Flex's curved form factor.|$|R
