30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a calorimetric method that {{provides}} another alternative to DSC, in the particular case of PCMs {{as well as in}} general. The <b>adiabatic</b> scanning <b>calorimeter</b> allows the determination of the same parameters as a DSC, combined with a direct measurement of the enthalpy curve h(T), but it does not suffer from the phase transition deformation because of a fundamentally different measurement principle [29, 30, 31, 32]. In adiabatic scanning calorimetry (ASC), the sample is heated by a controlled, constant amount of power. The sample uses this power, either to heat itself up, or, at the appropriate temperature, to undergo phase conversion. In the latter case, the sample remains at the same temperature until the conversion is complete. As such, the sample remains in equilibrium all the time, and the results do thus not suffer from deformation like in a DSC. We will provide a more detailed description of the technique below.|$|R
