40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{occurrence}} of Aeromonas sp in the bottled mineral water, well water and tap water from the municipal supplies. Positive samples were found for Aeromonas spp. 12. 7 % from the mineral water, 8. 3 % from the <b>artesian</b> <b>water</b> and 6. 5 % from the tap water. The recovery of Aeromonas spp. was significantly higher in the bottled mineral and <b>artesian</b> <b>water</b> than in the tap water from municipal supplies. The occurrence of the Aeromonas spp. did not correlate significantly with the contamination indicator bacteria (i. e. total coliforms) in the <b>artesian</b> <b>water</b> samples. However, a significant correlation was found between Aeromonas spp. and total coliforms in the both mineral water and tap water samples. The {{presence or absence of}} a correlation between the indicator bacteria and Aeromonas could reflect the occasional appearance of the pathogen in the drinking water and the different rates of survival and recovery of these agents compared with those fecal indicators. The finding that 41. 6, 14. 8 and 9. 0 % of the <b>artesian</b> <b>water,</b> bottled mineral water and tap water, respectively, sampled in the current study failed to meet the Brazilian standard for total coliforms in the drinking water should therefore be of concern...|$|R

These investigations produced a Queensland phenomenon without Australian precedent in terms of rationale, geographical diversity, and commitment of resources. In some regions, exposure of herds to fluoride emerged as an urgent issue because fluoride was perceived as an invasive, invisible, and odourless ‘contaminant’ in <b>artesian</b> <b>water.</b> This paper discusses the scientific background to, and management of, concerns over the consumption by stock of <b>artesian</b> <b>water</b> with {{a high concentration of}} natural bioavailable fluoride. The Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock managed the problem by scientific investigation, methodical field study, and the application of research findings to animal husbandry. The practical solutions arrived at involved rotation of stock on an age-related basis to and from certain bore supplies, fencing young sheep away from the artesian supply, fencing young sheep near the bore-head, and limiting the use of supplements...|$|R

This highlights the need for an improved surveillance system for both the bottled water industry and the municipal water supplies. Strains belonging to the genera Aeromonas identified to the species level were A. hydrophila and A. jandaei. The public health significance of the large number of Aeromonas spp. that can develop in water is unclear. There is an urgent need to compare the effects of a greater number of strains belonging to each of these species in a wider range of animal models of infection. These results can contribute to the re-evaluation of the criteria used to analyse the microbial quality of drinking water and to define measures for limiting Aeromonas densities in drinking water...|$|R

40|$|Annotation. The {{problems}} and technological solutions {{have been considered}} for the demineralization and cleaning of the low-potential <b>artesian</b> <b>waters</b> of North Dagestan, promising for using in the systems of geothermal hot water supply and as a source of drinking water. The proposed method allows the problem of single-stage cleaning waters from arsenic compounds and humic acids. This method has been tested on Dagestan <b>artesian</b> <b>waters,</b> which contained arsenic in an amount significantly exceeding a standard value for such pollutant. Abstract. This study is aimed at decision of important socio-economic problems, such as heat and water supply to the population of the arid zones of Northern Dagestan based on complex use of low-potential geothermal waters’ reserves.  Arsenic compounds and humic acids {{was found in the}} most studied waters in amounts far exceeding World Health Organization (WHO) limiting rate for drinking water by spectral analysis methods (AAS, SPM). The sorbent based on DEAE-cellulose modified with Fe 3 + ions was prepared and tested by us for cleaning of the waters containing the arsenic compounds in an amount of more than 700 mcg/dm 3 and humic acids in an amount approximately equal to 200 mg/dm 3. This method has been successfully applied for the demineralization and cleaning of <b>artesian</b> <b>waters</b> in Kizlyarskiy, Tarumovskiy and Babayurtovskiy areas of Dagestan Republic to produce pure water complied with drinking water quality specification.  Further studies, in our opinion, should be carried out in two directions, namely, coverage of new adjacent territories to study the mineral composition and identification of pollutants of underground drinking water of the North Caucasus region of Russia, as well as the creation of new efficient methods of purification of <b>artesian</b> <b>water</b> with a wider range of their pollutants. </p...|$|R
40|$|When an inland lake is reclaimed, the {{phreatic water}} {{table in the}} {{unconfined}} aquifer above the semi-pervious layer is lowered over {{the area of the}} newly formed polder. The lowering has a large influence on the <b>artesian</b> <b>water</b> level. This water table will drop, with the result that outside the polder water from the unconfined aquifer percolates downward through the semi-previous layer, while inside the polder <b>artesian</b> <b>water</b> percolates upwards through this layer, appreciably increasing the amount of drainage water to be pumped out. This results in lowering of the phreatic water table outside the polder. After due consideration of the groundwater flow, the authors devise the artificial means to prevent the lowering of the phreatic water table outside the polder with a two-layered leaky artesian aquifer...|$|R

40|$|A {{large part}} of western Manatee County {{is devoted to the}} growing of winter {{vegetables}} and citrus fruits. As in most of peninsular Florida, rainfall in the county during the growing season is not sufficient for crop production and large quantites of <b>artesian</b> <b>water</b> are used for irrigation. The large withdrawals of <b>artesian</b> <b>water</b> for irrigation result in a considerable decline of the artesian head {{in the western part of}} the county. This seasonal decline of the artesian head has become larger as the withdrawal of <b>artesian</b> <b>water</b> has increased. The lowering of the fresh-water head in some coastal areas in the State has resulted in an infiltration of sea water into the water-bearing formations. The presence of salty <b>water</b> in the <b>artesian</b> aquifer in parts of the coastal area of Manatee County indicates that sea water may also have entered the waterbearing formations in this area as a result of the decline of artesian pressure during the growing season. The purpose of the investigation is to make a detailed study of the geology and ground-water resources of the county, primarily to determine whether salt-water encroachment has occurred or is likely to occur in the coastal area.
