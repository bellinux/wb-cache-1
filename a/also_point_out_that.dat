Responsibilities for their care can compromise the agency of caregivers as well. This is a critical departure from the homo economicus model.|$|E
5|$|Discussion {{continues}} {{about the}} relative advantage or disadvantage of using the blades. Researchers and analysts <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the research studies are done on level, stationary treadmills, and do not measure performance from starting blocks or on actual curved tracks. They also do {{not take into account}} differences in physiology between amputees and non-amputees, who have such factors as musculature, blade height and weight and differences in blood circulation patterns due to the history of their limb loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of significant LGBT characters in modern speculative fiction television series {{has not been}} universal. For example, the Star Trek franchise's lack of same-sex relationships {{has long been a}} sore spot with LGBT fandom, some of whom have organised boycotts against the franchise to protest its failure to include LGBT characters. They <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Gene Roddenberry had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and the portrayal of same-sex relationships in Star Trek, but that the franchise's coverage has remained meagre.|$|E

25|$|Some {{consumers}} <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> government-enforced pasteurization law {{has been}} used as a tool for large business to shut out competition from smaller producers. See the case of the FDA's shut down of Goodflow Juice in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Funding for Tertiary Institutions {{has been}} criticised {{recently}} {{due to high}} fees and funding not keeping pace with costs or inflation. Some <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> high fees are leading to skills shortages in New Zealand as high costs discourage participation and graduating students seek well paying jobs off shore {{to pay for their}} student loans debts. As a result, education funding has been undergoing an ongoing review in recent years.|$|E

25|$|The authors <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the study's {{assessments}} {{strongly agree}} with the conclusions of earlier studies conducted by faculty at West Point, the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA), and the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). All four studies concluded that the program suffered from multiple problems in its creation and implementation, which inhibited {{the effectiveness of the}} teams in the field. Yet, all agree that a high majority of commanders were extremely supportive of the teams and found them effective.|$|E
25|$|Commentators <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that,</b> {{even if the}} ruling's Lochner era legal {{analysis}} is appropriate and correctly applied, Mackay Radio is flawed due to the economic assumptions the Court made. Justice Roberts' opinion assumed perfect competition in labor markets, a lack of monopsony, no statistical discrimination, no information asymmetry, market rationality, and a legal regime which provided {{a level playing field}} and equal protection under the law. Some—and possibly all—of these assumptions are incorrect. Worse, however, the Mackay Radio decision fashioned strong incentives which made it rational for one bargainer (management) to refuse to cooperate and opt out of bargaining.|$|E
25|$|The network's {{defenders}} {{note that}} the CBC's mandate differs from private media's, particularly in its focus on Canadian content; {{that much of the}} public funding actually goes to the radio networks; and that the CBC is responsible for the full cost of most of its prime-time programming, while private networks can fill up most of their prime-time schedules with American series acquired for a fraction of their production cost. CBC supporters <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> additional, long-term funding is required to provide better Canadian dramas and improved local programming to attract and sustain a strong viewership.|$|E

25|$|On the pro-terraforming {{side of the}} argument, {{there are}} those like Robert Zubrin, Martyn J. Fogg, Richard L. S. Taylor and the late Carl Sagan who {{believe that it is}} humanity's moral {{obligation}} to make other worlds suitable for life, as a continuation of the history of life transforming the environments around it on Earth. They <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Earth would eventually be destroyed if nature takes its course, so that humanity faces a very long-term choice between terraforming other worlds or allowing all terrestrial life to become extinct. Terraforming totally barren planets, it is asserted, is not morally wrong as it does not affect any other life.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the {{relative}} {{quality of the}} x86 architecture has been discussed. Critics of the switch say that x86 was a poor choice because of its lack of hardware registers compared to the PowerPC, {{and the lack of}} AltiVec (also known as Velocity Engine). Proponents have responded by saying that the x86 architecture has evolved greatly since the original 8086 was introduced, and that CPUs in general have combined RISC and CISC philosophies in their internal designs for some time, making the distinction obsolete. They <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> improved SSE could equal AltiVec, and that most programmers rarely deal with x86's peculiarities because the compiler does the work.|$|E
25|$|This {{system was}} {{designed}} {{to act as an}} incentive for utilities to improve their performance. According to MoWI, 14 out of the 20 regional UWSSAs fall into category A, 4 are classified as B while utilities in Babati and Lindi are in category C. The results of a study by Tobias A. Swai of the University of Dar es Salaam, however, indicated that Category A UWSSAs are the least efficient although they are self-sustaining. EWURA data <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> two out of the twenty regional utilities have an operating cost coverage ratio significantly higher than one, which means that they can sustain the current service level. Seven other utilities only just manage to keep their current operations running.|$|E

25|$|There {{are those}} that insist that because the governments of China and Taiwan {{abandoned}} their claims for monetary compensation, then the moral or legal responsibility for compensation belongs with these governments. Such critics <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> even though these governments abandoned their claims, they signed treaties that recognised the transfer of Japanese colonial assets to the respective governments. Therefore, to claim that these governments received no compensation from Japan is incorrect, and they could have compensated individual victims from the proceeds of such transfers. Others dispute that Japanese colonial assets in large proportion were built or stolen with extortion or force in occupied countries, as was clearly the case with artworks collected (or stolen) by Nazis during World War II throughout Europe.|$|E
25|$|Norman and Bennett {{note that}} some studies that {{compared}} alcoholics with non-alcoholics suggest alcoholism {{is linked to}} increased externality for health locus of control; however, other studies have linked alcoholism with increased internality. Similar ambiguity {{has been found in}} studies of alcohol consumption in the general, non-alcoholic population. They are more optimistic in reviewing the literature on the relationship between internal health locus of control and smoking cessation, although they <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> there are grounds for supposing that powerful-others and internal-health loci of control may be linked with this behavior. It is thought that, rather than being caused by one or the other, that alcoholism {{is directly related to the}} strength of the locus, regardless of type, internal or external.|$|E
25|$|The $500 million ten-year {{contract}} between UC Berkeley, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and BP (formerly BP Amoco), {{one of the}} world's largest energy production companies, officially went into effect Wednesday November 14, 2007 following approval {{by a majority of}} the faculty. The grant is the largest in the University's history. The deal has garnered criticism from some students and faculty who claim the agreement was negotiated in secret, and that it threatens Berkeley's reputation as an autonomous and democratic institution of higher learning. Supporters of the deal, on the other hand, assert that the infusion of capital from the venture will benefit the campus as a whole at a time when public universities are dealing with increasing cuts in State and Federal funding. They <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the BP deal focuses on developing alternative energy, an important issue in today's world.|$|E

25|$|Many {{scholars}} of Islam {{have taken this}} as a classification of the sura as stemming from the earlier Meccan period and have shown the Pope to be mistaken {{by pointing out that}} Surah 2 was revealed in various stages and that this verse was revealed after Muhammad's hijra from Mecca, during his period of stay in Medina and hence is from the Medinan period which was the final stage of the revelation of the Qur'an when the Muslims were becoming numerous and increasingly powerful and safe from the immediate dangers that had overshadowed them for 13 years in Mecca. The scholars <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the Pope failed to mention that even if this verse was revealed when the Muslims were weak, they could have easily abrogated it with another verse which gave them permission to forcefully convert people once they finally conquered Mecca; this, however, did not happen.|$|E
25|$|The {{obstruction}} {{charge was}} related to Drake allegedly deleting documents while he was purportedly aware that the FBI was investigating leaks to the media, and that the FBI was contemplating investigating leaks to Siobhan Gorman of The Baltimore Sun. The false statements charge was filed {{in relation to the}} FBI's questioning of Drake without a lawyer present in the initial stages of the investigation when he was cooperating with them. One count is for alleged statements made by him regarding whether he had willfully taken certain documents home. Another count is for allegedly lying about the purported transmission of classified information to Gorman. Drake's defenders point out that the government's own expert found that he had not destroyed any evidence. They <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Drake was careful not to give any classified information to Gorman, and that many of the documents in question were 'retroactively classified' after they were seized from his home by the FBI.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scientists}} have argued against Edelman's theory, instead suggesting that primary consciousness might have emerged {{with the basic}} vegetative systems of the brain. That is, the evolutionary origin might have come from sensations and primal emotions arising from sensors and receptors, both internal and surface, signaling that {{the well-being of the}} creature was immediately threatened—for example, hunger for air, thirst, hunger, pain, and extreme temperature change. This is based on neurological data showing the thalamic, hippocampal, orbitofrontal, insula, and midbrain sites are the key to consciousness of thirst. These scientists <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the cortex might not be as important to primary consciousness as some neuro{{scientists have}} believed. Evidence of this {{lies in the fact that}} studies show that systematically disabling parts of the cortex in animals does not remove consciousness. Another study found that children born without a cortex are conscious. Instead of cortical mechanisms, these scientists emphasize brainstem mechanisms as essential to consciousness. Still, these scientists concede that higher order consciousness does involve the cortex and complex communication between different areas of the brain.|$|E
