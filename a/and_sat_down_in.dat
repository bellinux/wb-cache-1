25|$|In 1939, Tucker {{organized}} a sit-in at Alexandria Library, which refused to issue library cards to black residents. On August 21, five {{young black men}} whom Tucker had recruited and instructed – William Evans, Otto L. Tucker, Edward Gaddis, Morris Murray, and Clarence Strange – entered the library one by one, requested applications for library cards and, when refused, each one took a book off the shelf <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the reading room until they were removed by the police. Tucker had instructed the men to dress well, speak politely and offer no resistance to the police so as to minimize the chance of the men being found guilty of disorderly conduct or resisting arrest. Tucker defended {{the men in the}} ensuing legal actions, which resulted in the disorderly conduct charges against the protestors being dropped by city attorney Armistead Boothe (who would later become a key figure in desegregating Virginia schools), and in a branch library being established for blacks.|$|E
25|$|The fourth-day of {{the battle}} was noted for the valour shown by Bhima. Bhishma {{commanded}} the Kaurava army to move on the offensive from the outset. While Abhimanyu {{was still in his}} mother's womb, Arjuna had taught Abhimanyu on how to break and enter the chakra vyuha. But, before explaining how to exit the chakra Vyuha, Arjuna was interrupted by Krishna (other story: Abhimanyu's mother falls asleep while Arjuna was explaining her). Thus from birth, Abhimanyu only knew how to enter the Chakra vyuha but didn't know how to come out of it. When the Kauravas formed the chakravyuha, Abhimanyu entered it but was surrounded and attacked by a number of Kaurava princes. Arjuna joined the fray in aid of Abhimanyu. Bhima appeared on the scene with his mace aloft and started attacking the Kauravas. Duryodhana sent a huge force of elephants at Bhima. When Bhima saw the mass of elephants approaching, he got down from his chariot and attacked them single-handedly with his iron mace. They scattered and stampeded into the Kaurava forces killing many. Duryodhana ordered an all-out attack on Bhima. Bhima withstood all that was thrown at him and attacked Duryodhana's brothers, killing eight of them. Bhima was soon struck by an arrow on the chest <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> his chariot dazed.|$|E
500|$|In the Sticky & Sweet Tour, [...] "Miles Away" [...] was {{performed}} during the gypsy {{segment of the}} show. Madonna wore a gypsy inspired Givenchy long cape, over a black dress, with pink colored ribbons around her neck. She also wore black stockings on her leg. Before starting the song she said, [...] "This is for all who know the struggle of long-distance relationships. I know you're out there." [...] While dancers gathered <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a circle around her, Madonna went up on a platform, started playing the acoustic guitar and encouraged the crowd to clap and sing along. The screens give another message to the song, showing a stream of world maps and passport stamps and the history as well as journey of gypsies travelling around the world, adding to the atmosphere of that particular section of the show.|$|E
60|$|So, <b>down</b> she <b>sat</b> {{upon the}} ground, <b>and</b> Harry <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> front of her.|$|R
60|$|He laughed again, {{this time}} uneasily, slammed the window to, bolted it, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>in</b> his chair.|$|R
60|$|But Edith {{could go}} no further. Her voice failed her <b>and</b> she <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> tears. Margaret {{did not try}} to stand up.|$|R
2500|$|In June 1800, McGready {{was joined}} at Red River by several area Presbyterian ministers, {{including}} William Hodge, John Rankin (whom McGready had recently appointed the minister for the Gasper River congregation), and the brothers, William and John McGee, the latter a Methodist minister who, some years later, wrote his {{account for the}} Methodist Missionary Magazine. [...] His narrative painted a vivid picture of the revival’s beginnings: [...] “All was silent until Monday, {{the last day of}} the feast. … [...] While Mr. Hodge was preaching, a woman in the East end got an uncommon blessing, broke through order, and shouted for some time and then sat down in silence." [...] McGee continued, relating that most of the ministers were already gathered outside the meeting house while the people remained seated inside, unwilling to leave, when his brother, William, “felt such a power come on him that he quit his seat <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the floor of the pulpit." [...] John McGee began to tremble as weeping erupted through the congregation. [...] The woman in the east end began to shout again and McGee started toward her just as someone reminded him that his Presbyterian hosts were “much for order” and would not “hear this confusion; go back and be quiet." [...] McGee turned to go back and was “near falling” when he changed his mind and “went through the house shouting and exhorting with all possible ecstasy and energy." [...] Using the term that came to be associated with the revival phenomenon of collapsing in a state of physical helplessness, McGee continued: [...] “The floor was soon covered with the slain; their screams for mercy pierced the heavens.” ...|$|E

60|$|Without a word, Mr. Jones {{stepped off}} the thwart <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the stern-sheets.|$|E
60|$|Gordon, who greeted Wheeler, floundered away, <b>and</b> Wheeler <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the dryest spot {{he could}} find, while Nasmyth grasped {{the handle of}} the machine.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> she <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the chair. It {{was evident}} {{she had come}} for a last talk. Ursula, not knowing what she wanted, waited in silence.|$|R
60|$|Peter {{tried hard}} not to look, he tried to push off, then he gave a great gulp and jumped ashore <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> miserably <b>in</b> the snow.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{returned}} to the vestibule <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> his favourite old oak chair.|$|E
60|$|Anne sighed, {{retreated to}} the east gable, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a chair by the window.|$|E
60|$|Trafford {{had left}} her side. He {{walked to the window}} <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a chair.|$|E
60|$|While {{he waited}} in the library for Mr. Forbes to return from Fairview a man was shown into the room <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> quietly <b>in</b> a corner.|$|R
60|$|Something in {{the quality}} of my voice gave her an intimation of unusual gravity. She looked at me {{steadily}} for a moment <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> slowly <b>in</b> my armchair.|$|R
6000|$|Then to {{the shore}} of the sea went Ulysses apart, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> glowing <b>in</b> beauty <b>and</b> grace, and the princess marvelled at him, and spake among her fair-tressed maidens, saying: ...|$|R
60|$|Presently he came <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> {{front of}} us, while I {{set out the}} case to him.|$|E
60|$|He drew a {{chair to}} the table <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> silence. Presently {{he turned to his}} wife.|$|E
60|$|Shorty stood up, slipped, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the water, {{while the}} boat dipped one gunwale under and righted again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down, Bob," [...] {{she said}} presently, <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> silence, finding his tongue unmanageable {{in quite a}} new fashion, refusing {{to say what he}} wanted it to say.|$|R
60|$|One person {{after another}} stood, answered, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>in</b> relief. At last {{there were only}} a few people left who had not been questioned. The Leiter paused, {{studying}} them intently.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oho!' he {{said when}} he had regained his own room, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> himself <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a chair with his arms akimbo. 'Oho! Are you there, my friend? In-deed!' ...|$|R
60|$|Very quietly, {{she placed}} a chair before the scanty fire, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> it, drawing her shawl about her.|$|E
60|$|He stopped {{somewhat}} abruptly, for Wisbech {{emerged from}} the shadows beneath the pillars, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a chair close by.|$|E
60|$|Presently Cheenbuk returned, {{somewhat}} paler than before, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> silence with a look, as if of regret, at the skeleton-goose.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy's legs shook <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the snow. After {{the long}} strain, his relief was poignant and reacted on his {{exhausted}} body. He gave the sergeant a dull, puzzled look.|$|R
60|$|After {{that they}} went a little to one side <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> them <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the soft long grass of the wayside and beneath {{the shadow of a}} wide-spreading tree.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Quest {{watched the}} door close <b>and</b> then <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a low armchair, and resting her head upon the back, looked {{up with a}} steady, enquiring gaze, full into Edward Cossey's face.|$|R
6000|$|He {{found them}} already eating marmalade, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the empty place between Stella and Sabina, who, after {{watching}} him a little, said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is {{the nature}} of the case?" [...] asked Lawrence, as they all came forward <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a {{semicircle}} before Mrs Stoutley.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. March had judged it decorous {{for her to}} say nothing, but she now went <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> {{the chair}} next her husband.|$|E
60|$|His {{attentive}} wife, {{seeing that}} he had ceased struggling, lifted him in her arms <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> him <b>down</b> <b>in</b> his chair with a force that threatened to snap his head off.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Guppy, whose incessant smiling {{gave her}} quite a waggish appearance, did as her son {{requested}} <b>and</b> then <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a corner, holding her pocket handkerchief to her chest, like a fomentation, with both hands.|$|R
60|$|So {{the elder}} brother {{looked in the}} mirror, and he was sore amazed; for {{he was an old}} man, and his hair was white upon his head; <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the hall <b>and</b> wept aloud.|$|R
