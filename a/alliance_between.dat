5|$|In later years, <b>alliance</b> <b>between</b> the Northern Uí Néill and the Vikings of Dublin {{became a}} regular occurrence: the Northern and Southern Uí Néill were {{frequent}} competitors for supremacy in Ireland, and the uneasy neighbourhood between Dublin and the Southern Uí Néill made the Vikings natural allies for the Northerners.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} that the battle took place before Somairle and Guðrøðr struggled for the kingship. Guðrøðr is otherwise known to have married a granddaughter of Muirchertach, and seems to have had an earlier marriage to another member of the Uí Néill. These marital unions could be evidence of an <b>alliance</b> <b>between</b> Guðrøðr and Muirchertach in the 1150s. Mac Scelling's participation in Muirchertach's service, therefore, could have been undertaken during a period of cooperation between the Isles and the Uí Néill. Nevertheless, an <b>alliance</b> <b>between</b> Somairle and Muirchertach may be perceptible as late as 1164, when the former lost his life leading an invasion of mainland Scotland. According to the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster, Somairle commanded troops from Dublin, a settlement which have recognised Muirchertach's overlordship at the time. One possibility is that a pact between the two concerned Somairle's support of Muirchertach regarding the Irish high-kingship, and Muirchertach's support of Somairle via Dublin.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the late 1380s and early 1390s, Isabeau {{demonstrated}} that she possessed diplomatic influence when the Florentine delegation requested her political intervention in the Gian Galeazzo Visconti affair. Orléans and the Duke of Burgundy were in the pro-Visconti faction while the anti-Visconti faction included Isabeau, her brother, Louis VII, Duke of Bavaria, and John III, Count of Armagnac. At that time Isabeau lacked the political power to effect change. Some years later, however, at the 1396 wedding of her seven-year-old daughter, Isabella, to Richard II of England (an event at which Charles attacked a herald for wearing Galeazzo's livery), Isabeau successfully negotiated an <b>alliance</b> <b>between</b> France and Florence with Florentine ambassador Buonaccorso Pitti.|$|E

5|$|Historian of Indonesia M. C. Ricklefs {{argued that}} the VOC victory in Surabaya {{probably}} accelerated the fall of Mataram.

Amangkurat I's successor, Amangkurat II, later told the VOC that the alliance with the VOC pushed his cousin Pangeran Purbaya towards the rebel side, and Purbaya's forces were among those who later overran the capital.|$|E
