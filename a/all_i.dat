5|$|One {{person could}} say that 'Hero' is a schmaltzy piece of garbage, but another person can write to me a letter and say, 'I've {{considered}} committing suicide {{every day of my}} life for the last ten years until I heard that song, and I realized, after <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> can be my own hero,' and that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done something with my life, you know?

5|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Joseph Kahn and produced by Danyi Deats-Barrett.

5|$|A {{continuous}} map between two topological spaces induces a group homomorphism between the associated homotopy groups. In particular, if the map is a continuous bijection (a homeomorphism), {{so that the}} two spaces have the same topology, then their i-th homotopy groups are isomorphic for <b>all</b> <b>i.</b> However, the real plane has exactly the same homotopy groups as a solitary point (as does a Euclidean space of any dimension), and the real plane with a point removed has the same groups as a circle, so groups alone are not enough to distinguish spaces. Although the loss of discrimination power is unfortunate, it can also make certain computations easier.|$|E
