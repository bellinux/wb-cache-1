5000|$|The {{beginnings}} of the <b>AMVER</b> <b>system</b> finds {{its roots in the}} [...] disaster in 1912. Ships passing within sight of the ill-fated passenger liner were unaware that it had hit an iceberg and was sinking. Upon later investigation, those who had seen the distress flares from the stricken ship admitted they thought they were merely part of the maiden voyage celebrations. As late as the mid-twentieth century the world's commercial shipping fleet and burgeoning air transport system lacked an available full-time, global emergency reporting system.|$|E
50|$|The Radio Navigational Aids (Publication 117) {{publication}} {{contains a}} detailed list of selected worldwide radio stations that {{provide services to}} the mariner. The publication is divided into chapters according {{to the nature of}} the service provided by the radio stations. The services include Radio direction finder and Radar Stations; stations broadcasting navigational warnings, time signals or medical advice; communication traffic for distress, emergency and safety including the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS) and long range navigational aids. It also contains chapters describing procedures of the <b>AMVER</b> <b>System,</b> and the interim emergency procedures and communication instructions to be followed by U.S merchant vessels in times of crisis. A new edition of Publication 117 is published annually. This publication is available in its entirety on the website and there are also database queries available for much of the data contained within.|$|E
40|$|An {{inventory}} of NO x emission from international shipping has been evaluated by comparing NO 2 tropospheric columns {{derived from the}} satellite instruments SCIAMACHY (January 2003 to February 2008), GOME (January 1996 to June 2003), and GOME- 2 (March 2007 to February 2008) to NO 2 columns calculated with the atmospheric chemistry general circulation model ECHAM 5 /MESSy 1 (January 2000 to October 2005). The data set from SCIAMACHY yields the first monthly analysis of ship induced NO 2 enhancements in the Indian Ocean. For both data and model consistently the tropospheric excess method was used to obtain mean NO 2 columns over the shipping lane from India to Indonesia, and over two ship free regions, the Bay of Bengal and the central Indian Ocean. In general, the model simulates {{the differences between the}} regions affected by ship pollution and ship free regions reasonably well. Minor discrepancies between model results and satellite data were identified during biomass burning seasons in March to May over India and the Indochinese Peninsula and August to October over Indonesia. We conclude that the NO x ship emission inventory used in this study is a good approximation of NO x ship emissions in the Indian Ocean for the years 2002 to 2007. It assumes that around 6 Tg(N) yr − 1 are emitted by international shipping globally, resulting in 90 Gg(N) yr − 1 in the region of interest when using Automated Mutual Assistance Vessel Rescue <b>System</b> (<b>AMVER)</b> or 72 Gg(N) yr − 1 when using the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) as spatial proxy. The results do not support some previously published lower ship emissions estimates of 3 – 4 Tg(N) yr − 1 globally, making this study the first that evaluates atmospheric response to NO x ship emission estimates from space...|$|R

The long-term data set from SCIAMACHY yields the first monthly analysis of ship induced NO 2 enhancements in the Indian Ocean. Comparison of data from the three instruments and in addition OMI reveals differences between the datasets which are discussed {{with respect to the}} diurnal cycle of NO 2 and the increase in shipping traffic over the time period studied.

40|$|Nitrogen oxide and dioxide {{emissions}} (NO NO 2 =NOx) by international shipping account for approximately 9 - 15 % of NOx global emission totals. As NOx {{participates in the}} catalytic production of tropospheric ozone, global chemistry climate models cannot neglect ship induced NOx in their forecast of future atmospheric development. Both {{the knowledge of the}} NOx emission flux as function of time and place and an understanding of the chemical processes transforming NOx in the atmosphere are needed. Thiswork addresses both aspects. The first part of this thesis analyses the method used by global models to include NOx ship emissions. For this purpose, the dispersion and chemical conversion of emissions in the near-field of a single ship are studied with two different modelling approaches. While both techniques use the same photochemical box model to solve the chemical equations, the dilution of the exhaust into the background air is different. One approach uses a Gaussian plume model and accounts for the expansion phase of a plume. The other one instantaneously disperses the emissions over a large gridbox, a technique commonly used by large scale models. The ozone change is overestimated by the global-model approach by up to a factor of three. One possibility to account for these sub-grid processes in global models is the use of effective emissions, i. e. actual emissions are changed and emissions of additional compounds like ozone are introduced {{in a way that they}} take sub-grid processes into account. It is shown for this case that the method is able to account for the neglect of sub-grid processes in global models for different emission times and emission strengths. In the second part of the thesis, an inventory of NOx emission from international shipping has been evaluated by comparing NO 2 tropospheric columns derived from the satellite instruments GOME (January 1996 to June 2003), SCIAMACHY (January 2003 to February 2008), and GOME- 2 (March 2007 to February 2008) to NO 2 columns calculated with the atmospheric chemistry general circulation model ECHAM 5 /MESSy 1 (January 2000 to October 2005).

For both data and model consistently the tropospheric excess method was used to obtain mean NO 2 columns over the shipping lane from India to Indonesia. In general, the model simulates the differences between the regions affected by ship pollution and ship free regions reasonably well. Therefore, it is concluded, that the NOx ship emission inventory used inthis study is a good approximation of NOx ship emissions inthe Indian Ocean for the years 2002 to 2007.
