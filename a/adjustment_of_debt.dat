40|$|This paper evaluates quantitatively the {{implications}} of the preferential tax treatment of debt in the United States corporate income tax code. Specifically we examine the economic consequences of allowing firms to deduct interest expenses from their tax liabilities on financial variables such as leverage, default decisions and credit spreads. Moreover our general equilibrium framework allows us to also investigate the consequences of this policy for economy-wide quantities such as investment and consumption. Contrary to conventional wisdom we find that changes in tax policy have only a small effect on equilibrium levels of corporate leverage. The intuition lies in the endogenous <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> prices in equilibrium that make debt relatively more attractive and largely offset the effect of the changes tax policy...|$|E
40|$|The {{inevitable}} <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> to {{a sustainable}} level {{that is consistent}} with current asset prices, and of saving to a level that represents a higher proportion of disposable income, will be a long and painful retrenchment process. The process whereby a higher saving ratio is triggered by lower net wealth has already started. Thus, retrenchment by the private sector could turn a double-dip recession into a protracted recession. U. S. equity prices have been falling since March 2000. In terms of magnitude, the current bear market resembles the mid- 1970 s plunge in equity prices, but it differs in terms of causes and the factors that should be used to monitor its progress. The 1970 s bear market (a supply-led business cycle) was the result of soaring inflation caused by a surge in oil prices that eroded household real disposabl...|$|E

40|$|Sukuk (Islamic debt securities) are {{dominating}} the Malaysian capital market with {{strong support from}} the government, mega-conglomerates and firms. Sukuk, as {{an important source of}} firms ’ financing, are increasingly catching up with the conventional bonds in terms of volume of transactions and number of sukuk issuances. However, from both theoretical perspectives, it is still largely unknown why some firms may consider sukuk issuance while others consistently rely on conventional bonds offers. In addressing this question, we examine our issuance choice based on two established corporate financing theories, namely the trade-off and pecking order theories. Empirical studies testing the trade-off theory focus on its key predictions that firms should balance the benefits against the cost of debt, and thus, have optimal debt ratio (i. e. target debt) but due to transaction cost, may temporarily deviate from such target and seek to adjust towards it. In examining this dynamic adjustment behavior, most studies employed partial adjustment model and found mixed evidences for active dynamic <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> The objective of this paper is twofold. First, to test firm target debt optimizing behavior and second, to find firm’s specific determinants of target debt ratio using sukuk or conventional bonds issuance...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this survey is testing the Fisher's quantity theory of money and the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level (FTPL) to measure the root of money or debt of inflation; for Iran, South Korea, China and India by panel data approach. Thus at the first step we expressed the theoretical fundamental of Fisher's quantity theory of money, FTPL theory and checking research background (similar internal and external studies). In the next step we estimate panel models by considering various conditions and the related tests (F Leamer and Hausman) and finally we identified the monetary root and debt of Inflation by selecting a fixed effects panel model. The survey results also indicate that in the panel estimates of all models (fixed effects), the coefficient of annual amount of money growth variable (MQMgr) was a significant factor and other factors are meaningless, including the annual growth rate of government debt to GDP. So in these countries, the monetary root of inflation confirmed but the debt root of inflation is not verified. The {{results of this study}} adapt with all internal and external studies in the field of monetary roots of inflation in most developing countries. Therefore we suggested liquidity management, <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> monetary policy, enhancing the productivity and technological power of production, currency control and reducing the dependence on foreign earnings from oil exports as well as controlling the budget deficit and government debt as a policy solution for inflation adjustment...|$|E
30|$|As our {{approach}} {{allows for a}} richer set of choices {{with respect to the}} corporate “financing policies”, it makes an important contribution to the literature on firm valuation: it introduces more realistic assumptions of the firms debt policies. Empirically, firms do not seem to follow either of the two simplified financing policies from above. In the corporate finance literature, there has been a long debate around the question if at all, and if so how frequently firms adjust their debt level and/or capital structure towards changes in firm value. Fischer et al (1989) showed that transaction costs play an important role for the adjustment of the debt level towards a certain target value determined by an optimal leverage ratio. Huang and Ritter (2009) found evidence that firms adjust half way towards a target leverage on book values at a moderate speed of 1.6 – 3.7 years. Leary and Roberts (2005) find a full <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> levels towards a target market leverage in 2 – 4 years after equity issues and equity shocks. Thus, by introducing the firm’s historic refinancing/adjustment policy or a policy representative for the respective industry, our model allows for more realistic estimates of the tax shield in firm valuation. While our results indicate a significant economic effect of discontinuous financing on the tax shield value for high debt levels and extremely long refinancing periods, we also find the traditional ME financing policy to generate relatively robust value estimates for low-levered firms with short refinancing intervals.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This study aims to {{evaluate}} the impact of listed Portuguese companies' specific determinants on adjustment of actual debt towards target debt ratio. The specific determinants on adjustment of actual debt towards target debt ratio that we consider are: asset tangibility, size, profitability and market to book ratio. Design/methodology/approach – Dynamic panel estimators are used to determine adjustment of the actual level of debt towards optimal level of debt, revealing the level of transaction costs borne by companies. OLS regressions are also used, in order to estimate the impacts of companies' specific determinants on debt adjustment. Findings – The results suggest that transaction costs are relevant in listed Portuguese companies' access to debt. Tangibility of assets and size are determinants that contribute for a greater <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> towards optimal level. The results also suggest that the capital structure decisions of listed Portuguese companies can be explained {{in the light of}} trade-off and pecking order theories, and not according to what is forecast by market timing theory. Originality/value – Through this study, the level of adjustment of actual debt towards target debt ratio in the context of companies belonging to under-developed capital markets are determined, in the particular case of this study, belonging to the Portuguese capital market. Furthermore, from target debt ratio depending on companies' specific determinants, the explanatory power of trade-off, pecking order and market timing theories are investigated. The results contribute for a deeper understanding about companies' capital structure decisions. Companies, Cost estimates, Debts, Portugal...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. P. P. A., Public Policy and Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. In 2011, Governor Brown signed AB 506 (Wieckowski), which {{established}} a mandated mediation {{process as a}} pre-condition to filing for municipal bankruptcy in California. Historically, municipal bankruptcies were a rare occurrence; when three municipalities within the state filed for bankruptcy protections {{in the summer of}} 2012, focus on the negotiation process within insolvent municipalities further magnified. To answer whether mandated mediation can prevent municipal bankruptcies and to determine how negotiation applies specifically in these situations, I applied a negotiation condition framework to case studies of California???s recent municipal bankruptcies. Using various public sources of data, including news articles and court statements, my thesis discovered two negotiation conditions affect the process more than any other factor: willingness to participate in negotiations and the complexity of contractual issues at stake. In addition, charting the changes in negotiation conditions over the case studies highlighted an evolution of those two conditions. The ultimate finding recognized that willingness to negotiate in municipal bankruptcies relies on court rulings answering contractual questions related to stakeholder inclusion in the overall <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>debts</b> process. Therefore, in municipal bankruptcies, litigation cannot be prevented with mediation; it in fact assists mediation. Public Policy and Administratio...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{contribute}} to the existing empirical financial literature on the determinants of capital structure and <b>adjustment</b> process, cost <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> determinants and the affect of capital structure on profitability in the context of non-financial Small and Medium size Enterprises (SME) in the UK. In order to formulate the testable hypothesis different capital structure theories are reviewed. A firm can choose equity, debt or both to finance its operations. The selection <b>of</b> optimal <b>debt</b> equity mix is a crucial issue in finance. The Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) is considered to control for simultaneous equation bias employing both firm specific and macroeconomic variables. For entire population of non-financial SMEs in the UK using Two Stage Least Square (TSLS) methodology, we focused on determinants of the cost <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> capital and the impact of capital structure on profitability. Results indicate that findings are consistent with the pecking order theory, trade-off theory and agency theory. Our results show that short term debt {{plays an important role in}} capital structure, cost <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and profitability <b>of</b> SMEs in the UK. Moreover, the short term debt is appeared to be more expensive for the manufacturing sector and more profitable for service sector whilst size and macroeconomic variables have a significant impact on leverage. ...|$|R

The article argues that if agents perceive holdings <b>of</b> government <b>debt</b> as part <b>of</b> their wealth, changes in the real value <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> will have an effect on consumption behaviour. Therefore {{to assess the impact of}} fiscal policy on consumption it may be necessary to adjust budget figures so that they accurately indicate changes in the real value <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> held by the private sector.

40|$|The {{publication}} of Modigliani and Miller's seminal {{work in the}} late 1950 s ignited a debate on the appropriate debt-to-equity ratio that companies should aim to achieve in the long-term. But although some {{progress has been made}} on the subject, the theories that emerged are imprecise, unwieldy and in most cases present completely opposing views. Moreover, the empirical evidence for the different theories is largely confined to firms in industrialised countries. This thesis examines the determinants of capital structure decisions of Nigerian listed firms, more specifically it focuses on the relationship between the business risk and leverage choices of ninety-four publicly listed companies in Nigeria over the period of seven years from 2000 to 2006 using a dynamic panel data framework under different degrees of uncertainty in market demand conditions. Reduced form leverage equations are derived and estimated by means of the Generalized-Method-of- Moments-Instrumental-Variables (GMM-IV) techniques which correct for the misspecification error induced by endogeneity of explanatory variables. The results indicate that, the design and <b>adjustment</b> process <b>of</b> the <b>debt</b> structure <b>of</b> our group of Nigerian listed companies is within the framework of a quadratic (a UShaped) relationship as suggested by Kale et al. (1991). This implies that at the average level of the change in total liability as a percentage of total assets is nonlinearly correlated to business risk. In normal times when the threat of insolvency is low, firms cut their average rate of borrowing relative to total assets by between 1 and 4 percent a year. However, they raise it by between 5 and 22 percent during periods of heightened market anxiety. This suggests that policies which lower the expected bankruptcy costs relative to company value will discourage an unnecessary use <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
