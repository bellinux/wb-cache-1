5|$|Franjo Klein, a Vienna-born Zagreb architect, was {{commissioned}} {{to build the}} synagogue. Klein, a representative of romantic historicism, modeled the building on the Viennese Leopoldstädter Tempel (1858), a Moorish Revival temple designed by Ludwig Förster. It became a prototype for synagogue design in Central Europe. Zagreb Synagogue used the <b>already</b> <b>developed</b> round arch style (Rundbogenstil), but did not adopt Förster's early oriental motifs.|$|E

5|$|When Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin was {{announced}} in November 2011, Oceaneering had <b>already</b> <b>developed</b> a working prototype of the ride vehicle. The first concept art for the attraction was released in April 2012: a circular ride vehicle, seating eight riders in two rows of four. On May 11, 2012 Oceaneering filed a patent application for the ride's technology. At the November 2012 IAAPA Attractions Expo, SeaWorld Orlando and Oceaneering International revealed the trackless, motion simulator-based ride vehicle to the public.|$|E

5|$|By 77 BC, {{the rivalry}} between the Red and the Whites was <b>already</b> <b>developed,</b> when a funeral for a Red driver {{involved}} a Red supporter throwing {{himself on the}} funeral pyre. No writer of the time, however, refers to these as factions such as came into existence later, with the factions being official organizations. Writing {{near the beginning of}} the third century, he wrote that the Reds were dedicated to Mars, the Whites to the Zephyrs, the Greens to Mother Earth or spring, and the Blues to the sky and sea or autumn. Domitian created two new factions, the Purples and Golds, which disappeared soon after he died. The Blues and the Greens gradually became the most prestigious factions, supported by emperor and populace alike. Numerous occasions occurred when a Blue vs. Green clash would break out during a race. Indeed, Reds and Whites are only rarely mentioned in the surviving literature, although their continued activity is documented in inscriptions and in curse-tablets.|$|E
5|$|Only wall {{clouds that}} rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds {{may be a}} visual manifestation of a {{low-level}} mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases {{by the time it}} reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has <b>already</b> <b>developed,</b> signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have <b>already</b> <b>developed</b> or {{are in the process}} of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E

5|$|The city {{started from}} an inland town that {{extended}} to the coast. The Bairro da Matriz, whose nucleus was the centre from whence the city grew, is intersected by 14th century narrow and twisted streets lined by single family homes. The historical district has old buildings such as the sixteenth-century house in front of Matriz Church — the main church, the old Town Hall (14th century), the seventeenth century Solar dos Carneiros and house of Captain Leite Ferreira, and the eighteenth century Limas and the Coentrão Houses. The fishermen were grouped in the south coast, around Póvoa Cove (Enseada da Póvoa); The fisher district was <b>already</b> <b>developed</b> in the 18th century with its structure of narrow streets parallel to the coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{arose in the}} early 1970s while Tobe Hooper was working as an {{assistant}} film director at the University of Texas at Austin and as a documentary cameraman. He had <b>already</b> <b>developed</b> a story involving the elements of isolation, the woods, and darkness. He credited the graphic coverage of violence by San Antonio news outlets as one inspiration for the film and based elements of the plot on serial killer Ed Gein in 1950s Wisconsin; Gein inspired other horror films such as Psycho (1960) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991). During development, Hooper used the working titles of Headcheese and Leatherface.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} {{a tropical}} storm, Blanca had <b>already</b> <b>developed</b> an eye-feature, though it {{not expected to}} develop into a hurricane. The storm maintained a general northwestward track throughout its existence due to a mid-level ridge well {{to the west of}} the circulation. Shortly after, a central dense overcast, a large area of deep convection, developed over the center of circulation and large banding features developed along the periphery of the cyclone. Late on July6, Blanca reached its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) and a barometric pressure of 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg). Although the storm had intensified, its overall structure had deteriorated, with cloud tops warming and convection shrinking.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{writing for}} the first season was split between the Wachowskis and Straczynski. The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said {{a good portion of}} the writing was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski {{believes}} writing with the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party to learn from the other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, he views himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works is by first developing the entire script in his head, from the first sentence to the last, before sitting down to write it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes they have <b>already</b> <b>developed,</b> leaving the others they haven't figured out yet for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in which way they work best.|$|E
5|$|On November14, the National Weather Service {{issued a}} slight risk of severe weather {{for the early}} hours of November15 for the Carolinas and {{northern}} Gulf coast. Although conditions were not favorable for a large-scale severe weather event, the possibility of small clusters of thunderstorms existed. Strong wind shear was forecast to persist, which would allow small bow-echo line of thunderstorms which could produce damaging winds. The result of a weak disturbance which passed through the area of slight risk lowered the chances of tornadic thunderstorms developing. At 12:25a.m. EST, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a Tornado watch for most of eastern North Carolina. A broken line of thunderstorms had <b>already</b> <b>developed</b> and the risk of tornadoes greatly increased, with the chances of an EF2 or stronger touching down reaching 20%. The first tornado touched down shortly after in South Carolina. Over the following several hours, two supercell thunderstorms spawned seven more tornadoes throughout North Carolina. The final tornado dissipated around 4:36a.m. EST, just 3 hours and 46 minutes after the outbreak started. The tornado watch remained in effect until before being cancelled at 8:00a.m. EST.|$|E
5|$|On October 18, several {{thunderstorms}} <b>already</b> <b>developed</b> {{during the}} morning hours and continued to intensify during the afternoon. Just after 11:00 am EDT, one tornado in downtown Pensacola, Florida caused some extensive damage {{to the roof of}} a Baptist church as well as portions of Cordova Mall but there were no reported injuries at the Church and daycare center. During the early evenings severe weather affected the Louisville, Kentucky Metro area in which tree damage and power outage were reported throughout the area and a possible tornado at around 7:00 pm EDT near the Crescent Hill area which was later confirmed as a brief EF0. Still in the region, one tree fell over a passing car but the motorist escaped injuries although he was trapped for several minutes inside. The Louisville power authority, the LG reported as much as 2,500 homes without power mostly in St. Matthews and Crescent Hill areas. More storms rolled through much of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys {{during the second half of}} the evening and overnight with more storms in Michigan.|$|E

5|$|The Oman Chairman of the National Committee for Civil Defence, General Malek Bin Sulaiman Al Ma'amari, remarked {{the nation}} had <b>already</b> <b>developed</b> a {{contingency}} plan, {{which included the}} activation of army and police personnel after the storm's passage. Significant damage was expected, especially in northeastern areas, along with up to 150mm (6in) of rainfall and very strong winds. Officials recommended citizens evacuate from potentially affected areas, and about 7,000people were forced to leave Masirah Island due {{to the threat of}} high surf and strong winds. Overall, more than 20,000people evacuated to emergency shelters. A state of emergency was declared for the nation. The Omani national weather service warned that the cyclone was expected to be worse than the destructive cyclone that hit Masirah Island in 1977. The Mina al Fahal oil terminal closed for over three days due to the threat of the storm. Omani officials closed government offices for two days and declared a five-day-long national holiday. Most businesses near the coastline were closed prior to the announcement. Authorities at the Muscat International Airport (then named as Seeb International Airport) canceled of all flights after 2000UTC on June 5 due to the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|The prize, a 24-gun {{corvette}} named Utile, {{was taken}} into service with the Royal Navy as HMS Utile and Lydiard was promoted and given command of her, a commission confirmed on 22 July 1796. Macnamara's later service with Nelson included the capture of Portoferraio, the evacuations of Caprera and Corsica, and expeditions against Piombino and Castiglione. Macnamara had <b>already</b> <b>developed</b> a reputation for intrepidity bordering on recklessness, and he displayed these qualities again in {{an attack on the}} 18-gun Spanish brig Corso in a strong gale under enemy shore batteries. The first attempt to capture her failed, with only one man, the coxswain, getting on board. Macnamara tried again, managing to place 30 men aboard the Spanish ship, at which she surrendered. Having done so the weather prevented any further attempt to make contact with the prize. One of Macnamara's last acts in support of the Mediterranean Fleet was {{to take part in the}} Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797, in which Southampton formed part of the centre of the line as a repeating frigate.|$|E
5|$|While Rowley and Hamelin had sparred in the Indian Ocean, Corbet {{had made}} the lengthy journey back to Britain. During his time in command of Nereide, Corbet had <b>already</b> <b>developed</b> a {{reputation}} as a strict disciplinarian, regularly beating his men for the slightest infractions, {{to the extent that he}} had provoked a brief mutiny on Nereide in 1808. His reputation spread before him, and when he switched commands with Captain Richard Raggett of HMS Africaine, he was met with a storm of protest from Africaines crew. Although none of the men aboard Africaine had served with Corbet before, his preference for brutal punishment was well known in the Navy and the crew sent a letter to the Admiralty insisting that they would not serve under him. Concerned at what they considered to be mutiny, the Admiralty sent three popular officers to Africaine with the message that if the protest was quietly dropped there would be no courts-martial for mutiny but if not, the entire crew would be liable to attack. To emphasise the threat, the frigate HMS Menelaus was brought alongside with her gunports open and her cannon ready to fire. Chastened, the crew of Africaine allowed Corbet aboard and the frigate sailed for the Indian Ocean a few days later, carrying instructions for the authorities at Madras to prepare an expeditionary force to invade Isle de France.|$|E

5|$|The British {{airborne}} establishment {{was formed}} in June 1940 under the orders of the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, {{in response to the}} German use of airborne forces during the Battle of France. When the equipment to be used by the airborne forces was being developed, it had been decided by officials at the War Office that gliders would be an integral component of such a force; these would be used to transport troops and heavy equipment, which by 1941 had been expanded to include artillery and some form of tank. By the beginning of 1941, the War Office had issued four specifications for military gliders to be used by the airborne forces. The first was Air Ministry specification X.10/40, which called for an eight-seater glider similar to the German DFS 230, which eventually became the General Aircraft Hotspur I; the second was specification X.25/40 which became the Slingsby Hengist, a fifteen-seat glider; the third was specification X.26/40, the 25-seater Airspeed Horsa; and the last, X.27/40 was for a glider that could carry a light tank or other heavy loads. The number of aeronautical firms able to design and produce gliders was limited, especially since several were already committed to producing other prop-driven aircraft for the government; as such, contracts for the gliders were allocated to firms as the government saw fit, rather than through any competitive process. Slingsby was chosen to develop X.25/40 because it was believed to be too small to build larger gliders, and Airspeed would eventually build the Horsa. Because it had <b>already</b> <b>developed</b> the Hotspur, which first flew in November 1940, and was considered to have a sufficiently developed production capacity capable of producing a larger glider, General Aircraft Limited were chosen to develop X.27/40.|$|E
