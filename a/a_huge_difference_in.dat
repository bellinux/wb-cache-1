In order to assess the possibility of conducting a big case–control study on ESCC in J&K, a feasibility study (FS) was undertaken to focus on: (1) establishing a collaboration between the clinicians and scientists, (2) building a referral set-up for identification, diagnosis and recruitment of cases, (3) adapting, pre-testing and validation of dietary and lifestyle questionnaires for study populations and (4) assessing the possibility of collection, storage, transportation and analyses of biological specimens for various purposes including genome-wide association study (GWAS).|$|R

30|$|Since {{this paper}} mainly {{discusses}} legal rights {{protection of workers}} based on civil rights rather than the strikes of industrial workers and collective negotiations, its perspective consequently focuses {{on the relationship between}} the state and workers based on citizenship. In this regard, the existing legalism perspective mainly emphasizes the path dependence of institutions and their subsequent constraints on workers. For example, Chen (2007) believes that the Chinese state actively met the rights of individual workers (contracts, wages, working conditions, benefits, and so on) through labor legislation, but did not grant workers collective rights (rights to forming organizations, strikes, collective bargaining, and so on). Lack of collective rights always led to the absence of individual rights. This selective empowerment was rooted in the political tradition of Leninism and the current national development strategies (Chen 2007). Similarly, Gallagher (2006) also stresses the impact of legal individualism on the individualization of collective actions and labor disputes by Chinese workers. However, these studies overestimated the impact of the static legal system on workers.

It {{was found that the}} subsequent annealing at 750 and 800 °C resulted in prominent gradual decrease of the mechanical stability under tensile straining, detectable after 10 s annealing duration and continued until 1000 s. Only minimal grain growth occurred, which decreased the stability very marginally. The degree of the stability drop followed the predicted kinetics of the Cr 2 N precipitation with regards as its dependence on annealing duration and temperature. Further, the tensile yield strength of the fine-grained structure increased slightly due to the annealing. The presence of nano-sized Cr 2 N particles was verified after 1000 s holding at 750 °C. These observations and predictions yield firm evidence for the imperative contribution of precipitation to the highly reduced mechanical stability of grain-refined austenite in this steel...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the hospital episode rates in cardiovascular disease by sex and across age groups in order to understand whether and how the use of health services for cardiovascular disease might have changed in recent years in the north-east of England. Methods: Hospital episode data in 2010 – 2014 covering 5 full calendar years was extracted from Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, which is serving a population of nearly half a million. Hospital episode rates were calculated from all admissions divided by annual and areaspecific population size for each sex and age group, presented per 100 000 person-years using Microsoft Excel. Results: The overall use for each subtype of cardiovascular disease seemed to decrease from 2010 to 2013, but increase from 2013 to 2014. This is particularly apparent in the very old, aged 80 and above, such as in the case of diagnoses owing to essential primary hypertension and angina. For atrial fibrillation and haemorrhagic strokes, a similar situation was observed in the oldest old-aged, 90 and above. For myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cerebral infarction, however, service use seemed to have remained constant over the last 5 years. Of note, there was <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> sex <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> health-service use for cerebral infarction in those aged 90 and above, where there were more women than men admitted. Conclusion: Examining local health-service use owing to the burden of cardiovascular disease annually might help indicate which of its subtypes might require more attention...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{the effect}} of water level on {{germination}} in soil seed banks has been documented in many ecosystems, the mechanism is not fully understood, and to date no empirical studies on this subject exist. Further, no {{work has been done}} on {{the effect of}} water level on seed banks of drying and saline-alkaline wetlands in alpine areas on the Tibetan Plateau. METHODOLOGY: We examined the effects of water level (0 cm, 5 cm and 10 cm) on seed germination and seedling establishment from soil seed banks at 0 - 5 cm and 5 - 10 cm depths in typical, drying, and saline-alkaline wetlands. We also explore the potential role of soil seed bank in restoration of drying and saline-alkaline wetlands. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Species richness decreased with increase in water level, but there almost no change <b>in</b> seed density. <b>A</b> <b>huge</b> <b>difference</b> exists <b>in</b> species composition of the seed bank among different water levels in all three wetlands, especially between 0 cm and 5 cm and 0 cm and 10 cm. Similarity of species composition between seed bank and plant community was higher in 0 cm water level in drying wetland than in the other two wetlands. The similarity was much higher in 0 cm water level than in 5 cm and 10 cm water levels in all three wetlands. Species composition of the alpine wetland plant community changed significantly after drying and salinization, however, species composition of the seed bank was unchanged regardless of the environment change. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Water level greatly affects seed bank recruitment and plant community establishment. Further, different water levels in restored habitats are likely to determine its species composition of the plant community. The seed bank is important in restoration of degraded wetlands. Successful restoration of drying and salinization wetlands could depend on the seed bank...|$|R

However, constructing these proofs remains a black art, involving many choices in the formulation of definitions and theorems that make <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> cumulative <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the difficulty of carrying out large formal developments. The representation and manipulation of terms with variable binding is a key issue. We propose a novel style for formalizing metatheory, combining locally nameless representation of terms and cofinite quantification of free variable names in inductive definitions of relations on terms (typing, reduction, [...] .). The key technical insight is that our use of cofinite quantification obviates the need for reasoning about equivariance (the fact that free names can be renamed in derivations); in particular, the structural induction principles of relations defined using cofinite quantification are strong enough for metatheoretic reasoning, and need not be explicitly strengthened. Strong inversion principles follow (automatically, in Coq) from the induction principles. Although many of the underlying ingredients of our technique have been used before, their combination here yields a significant improvement over other methodologies using first-order representations, leading to developments that are faithful to informal practice, yet require no external tool support and little infrastructure within the proof assistant. We have carried out several large developments in this style using the Coq proof assistant and have made them publicly available. Our developments include type soundness for System F and core ML (with references, exceptions, datatypes, recursion, and patterns) and subject reduction for the Calculus of Constructions. Not only do these developments demonstrate the comprehensiveness of our approach; they have also been optimized for clarity and robustness, making them good templates for future extension...|$|R
