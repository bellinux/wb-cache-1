25|$|One {{question}} we might <b>ask</b> <b>is</b> whether, {{if we had}} chosen a different free ultrafilter V, the quotient field A/U would be isomorphic as an ordered field to A/V. This question {{turns out to be}} equivalent to the continuum hypothesis; in ZFC with the continuum hypothesis we can prove this field is unique up to order isomorphism, and in ZFC with the negation of continuum hypothesis we can prove that there are non-order-isomorphic pairs of fields that are both countably indexed ultrapowers of the reals.|$|E
25|$|But how, {{one might}} <b>ask,</b> <b>is</b> this still {{thriving}} given the increasing emphasis on internet security? The simple, but unfortunate solution, according to Symantec’s “Internet Security Threat Report”, {{is that of}} the expanding “underground economy”. With more than fifty percent of the supporting servers located in the United States, this “underground economy” has become a haven for internet thieves, who use the system in order to sell stolen information. These pieces of information can range from generic things such as a user account or email to something as personal as a bank account number and PIN.|$|E

The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can <b>ask</b> <b>is</b> that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E

500|$|In short, {{a person}} could refuse to answer a {{question}} if that particular answer could incriminate them, e.g., a professional killer could decline to answer the question of what his or her occupation was.

Saying your occupation is [...] "assassin" [...] or [...] "professional killer" [...] could, and therefore the 5th Amendment could be invoked as to that question; saying you made $635,000 last year does not provide evidence of anything criminal and thus it could not.|$|E
500|$|Back to the Egg {{received}} predominantly negative reviews on release; author Alan Clayson {{writes of}} the album receiving [...] "a critical mauling as vicious as that for London Town". In an especially unfavourable critique for Rolling Stone magazine, Timothy White described it as [...] "the sorriest grab bag of dreck in recent memory" [...] and lamented {{that none of the}} songs were [...] "the least bit fleshed out", with the listener instead given [...] "an irritating display of disjointed images and unfocused musical snapshots". After opining that, since 1970, [...] "this ex-Beatle has been lending his truly prodigious talents... to some of the laziest records in the history of rock & roll", White wrote: [...] "Who, one felt compelled to <b>ask,</b> <b>is</b> in charge here?

500|$|... "Fire in My Heart" [...] is 2 {{minutes and}} 45 seconds long {{and is in}} the key of E major. The song begins with Gruff Rhys singing the first verse backed only by finger picked {{acoustic}} guitar. Rhys's vocals are joined by sparse drums, a synthesizer, organ and harmony backing vocals in the second verse which immediately follows the first at 31 seconds. The drums become louder during the third and final verse which leads into a bridge that begins after 1 minute and 31 seconds. During the bridge Rhys sings the lines [...] "Oh the monkey puzzle tree has some questions for the watchdogs of the profane, and I <b>ask,</b> <b>is</b> it sad that I'm driving myself mad as this fire in my heart turns blue". A key change to F♯ major follows for the final verse, with Rhys repeating the line [...] "I've got a fire in my heart for you" [...] backed by multiple harmony vocals. The song ends with a coda during which Rhys elongates the word [...] "you" [...] over the chords A minor, A, G minor and F.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the James–Stein estimator dominates the usual estimator for any ν. [...] A natural question to <b>ask</b> <b>is</b> whether the improvement over the usual estimator is independent of the choice of ν. [...] The answer is no. The improvement is small if [...] is large. [...] Thus to get a very great improvement some knowledge of the location of θ is necessary. [...] Of course this is the quantity we are trying to estimate so we don't have this knowledge a priori. [...] But we may have some guess as to what the mean vector is. [...] This can be considered a disadvantage of the estimator: the choice is not objective as it may depend on the beliefs of the researcher.|$|E
