5|$|Rats {{that live}} {{their entire lives}} indoors usually are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> disease-causing {{bacteria}} such as Salmonella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the latter is absent in treated water. They may also more easily avoid vectors like cockroaches, beetles, and fleas which are essential for the spread of endemic typhus and intestinal parasites like the Rat tapeworm. Additionally, pet or laboratory rats enjoy the intrinsic benefits of having a consistent and well-balanced diet, along with access to medical care.|$|E

Reviewing their files, he decides to concentrate his efforts on Michael Scofield, mastermind of the breakout. He tracks the escapees to Oswego, Illinois, but they manage to escape. Mahone continues to pursue Michael and his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell), who are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> him on several occasions. While investigating a car explosion Mahone is shown to have a drug problem, swallowing pills concealed in a pen.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} U.S. {{military}} operations in Iraq in December 2011, several Apache helicopters had been shot down by enemy fire, and others lost in accidents. In 2006, an Apache was downed by a Soviet-made Strela 2 (SA-7) in Iraq, despite the Apache being typically <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> such missiles. In 2007, four Apache helicopters were destroyed on the ground by insurgent mortar fire using web-published geotagged photographs taken by soldiers. Several AH-64s were lost to accidents in Afghanistan as of 2012. Most Apaches that took heavy damage were able to continue their missions and return safely.|$|E

50|$|The {{selective}} exposure phenomenon focuses on how people manage <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> incongruent information and primarily encounter information that supports predispositions. Obviously, most are not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> completely <b>avoid</b> all potentially challenging information. In these cases, message receivers may outright reject dissonant messages (Wheeless, 1974). The reasons for rejection are varied and plentiful. For example, the person might justify message rejection by attacking the source's credibility.|$|R

5|$|Champollion, {{a liberal}} and {{progressive}} minded man, {{lived in a}} period of political turmoil in France which continuously threatened to disrupt his research in various ways. During the Napoleonic wars he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> conscription, but his Napoleonic allegiances meant that he was considered suspect by the subsequent Royalist regime. His own actions, sometimes brash and reckless, did not help his case. His relations with important political and scientific figures of the time, such as Joseph Fourier and Silvestre de Sacy helped him, although in some periods he lived exiled from the scientific community.|$|E
5|$|In early October 1942, the {{division}} commenced Operation Kopaonik, targeting the Chetnik force of Major Dragutin Keserović in the Kopaonik Mountains, which ended with little success, as the Chetniks had forewarning {{of the operation}} and were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> contact. After a quiet winter, in January 1943 Phleps deployed {{the division}} to the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) to participate in Case White. Between 13 February and 9 March 1943 {{he was responsible for}} the initial aspects of raising the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian) in the NDH in addition to his duties commanding the 7th SS Division.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Edge and Randy Orton. Edge took early {{control of the}} match by driving Orton into the {{barricade}} outside the ring. Orton was able to recover, and performed a rope hung DDT on Edge. While setting up for his finishing move, the RKO, Orton appeared to injure his arm, and went outside the ring {{in an attempt to}} recover. Edge followed him, trying to perform the spear, but Orton was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> it, and Edge hit the barricade. Neither man was able to return to the ring before the count of ten, and as a result, the match ended in a double countout.|$|E

Additionally, theophylline may {{have a role in}} those who do not respond to other measures. Fewer than 20% of exacerbations require hospital admission. In those without acidosis from respiratory failure, home care ("hospital at home") may be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> help <b>avoid</b> some admissions.|$|R
5|$|Threefold {{repetition}} of position: This most commonly occurs when neither side is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage. In this situation, either player can claim a draw; this requires {{the players to}} keep a valid written record of the game so that the claim can be verified by the arbiter if challenged. The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid. FIDE rules make no mention of perpetual check; this is merely {{a specific type of}} draw by threefold repetition.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing his}} reelection bid in 1861, Stevenson, a known Confederate sympathizer, {{stayed out of}} public life {{during the war and}} was {{consequently}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> being imprisoned, as many other Confederate sympathizers were. In 1867, just five days after John L. Helm and Stevenson were elected governor and lieutenant governor, respectively, Helm died and Stevenson became acting governor. Stevenson subsequently won a special election in 1868 to finish Helm's term. As governor, he opposed federal intervention in what he considered state matters but insisted that blacks' newly granted rights be observed and used the state militia to quell post-war violence in the state. Although a fiscal conservative, he advocated a new tax to benefit education and created the state bureau of education.|$|E
5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E
40|$|Clark’s nutcrackers use {{spatial memory}} to recover stored {{food in the}} field and have {{performed}} very well in laboratory tests of spatial memory. During the present experiment, two groups of nutcrackers cached seeds every 4 days. Following each cache session, the stay group was tested with seeds in their caches; the shift group found seeds in novel sites. The stay group performed accurately throughout the experiment, but the shift group gave no indication of being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> sites where they had stored seeds. These results suggest that although nutcrackers can learn to shift away from remembered locations during some memory experiments, they cannot learn to shift away from cache sites. This raises interesting questions about the relationship between task characteristics, response strategies, and memory...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{concepts}} for {{the base}} station/anchor are typically mobile stations, large oceangoing vessels or other mobile platforms. Mobile base stations {{would have the}} advantage over the earlier stationary concepts (with land-based anchors) by being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> maneuver <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> high winds, storms, and space debris. Oceanic anchor points are also typically in international waters, simplifying and reducing cost of negotiating territory use for the base station.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} kind is the Brawler. Brawlers {{can sit on}} a downed {{opponent}} and punch their opponent's head repeatedly. They also have a special combination of 3 to 5 strikes. If the first strike connects, the defending wrestler is not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> block, <b>avoid</b> or counter {{the remainder of the}} strikes in the combination. Their special ability is called 'Wreck Shop', a limited adrenaline rush in which all opponent strikes are countered and all strikes become unblockable.|$|R
5|$|Edge {{returned}} from injury at the Royal Rumble {{as a surprise}} entrant in the Royal Rumble match, which he won, earning a guaranteed match for any WWE world championship. Following Jericho's victory in the Elimination Chamber, in which he won the World Heavyweight Championship, Edge speared him the following night on Raw and {{announced that he had}} elected to face Jericho at WrestleMania. Following this announcement, Edge began a campaign of surprise attacks on Jericho, spearing him on several occasions in an attempt to play mind games with Jericho. On the March 12 episode of SmackDown, Jericho hosted a special edition of his talk show segment, The Highlight Reel, with Edge as the guest. Edge attempted to spear Jericho again, but Jericho was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> it and hit Edge with the World Heavyweight Championship belt instead.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius's reign {{was marked}} by several {{military}} campaigns. The year Heraclius came to power, the empire was threatened on multiple frontiers. Heraclius immediately {{took charge of the}} Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628. The first battles of the campaign ended in defeat for the Byzantines; the Persian army fought their way to the Bosphorus but Constantinople was protected by impenetrable walls and a strong navy and Heraclius was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> total defeat. Soon after, he initiated reforms to rebuild and strengthen the military. Heraclius drove the Persians out of Asia Minor and pushed deep into their territory, defeating them decisively in 627 at the Battle of Nineveh. The Persian king Khosrau II was overthrown and executed by his son Kavadh II, who soon sued for a peace treaty, agreeing to withdraw from all occupied territory. This way peaceful relations were restored to the two deeply strained empires.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} after the war, Australian {{authorities}} were responsible for administering all of Borneo and the NEI east of Lombok until the British and Dutch colonial governments were re-established. While British and Indian forces in {{the west of the}} NEI became caught up in the Indonesian National Revolution, the Australians were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> clashes with local nationalists. Australian forces were also responsible for guarding the 344,000 remaining Japanese in the NEI and Australian territories and administering war crimes trials in these areas. A volunteer force was formed as Australia's contribution to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan, and Australia provided the BCOF's headquarters and a high proportion of its personnel. This force later formed the nucleus of the post-war Australian Army, which included permanent combat units for the first time.|$|E

30|$|For {{the mode}} mixing problem caused by intermittency signal in {{empirical}} mode decomposition (EMD), a novel filtering method is proposed in this paper. In this new method, the original data is pretreated by using wavelet denoising method <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the mode mixture {{in the subsequent}} EMD procedure. Because traditional wavelet threshold denoising may exhibit pseudo-Gibbs phenomena {{in the neighborhood of}} discontinuities, we make use of translation invariance algorithm to suppress the artifacts. Then the processed signal is decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by EMD. The numerical results show that the proposed method is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> effectively <b>avoid</b> the mode mixture and retain the useful information.|$|R
5|$|On August 7, Carpenter, with Captain Nolan {{as second}} in command, and three {{companies}} of troopers {{headed out to}} Sulfur Springs to deny that source of water to the Apaches. In the early light of day, Victorio saw a string of wagons rounding a mountain spur to the southeast and about eight miles distant, crawling onto the plain. Victorio sent a band of warriors riding {{out of the mountains}} and attacked savagely. The wagons held a load of provisions for Fort Davis with a company of infantry riding in some of the wagons. The warriors were met with rifle fire, as the teamsters circled the wagons in defensive positions. Alerted by his Indian scouts, Carpenter and two companies charged to the rescue. The Apache attack disintegrated as the warriors fled in confusion to the southwest to rejoin Victorio's main force as it moved deeper into the Carrizo Mountains. Nolan's ambush was not ready and the scattered warriors were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> them.|$|E
5|$|SETI {{researcher}} Carl Sagan {{believed that}} a civilization with the technological prowess needed to reach the stars and come to Earth must have transcended war to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> self-destruction. Representatives of such a civilization would treat humanity with dignity and respect, and humanity, with its relatively backward technology, would {{have no choice but}} to reciprocate. Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute, disagrees, stating that the finite quantity of resources in the galaxy would cultivate aggression in any intelligent species, and that an explorer civilization that would want to contact humanity would be aggressive. Similarly, Ragbir Bhathal claims that since the laws of evolution would be the same on another habitable planet as they are on Earth, an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization may have the motivation to colonize humanity, much as British colonizers did to the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E
5|$|The new format {{meant that}} all cars {{took to the}} track quickly in Q1, with {{everyone}} setting lap times on the super-soft compound, the fastest tyre available at the event. The two Manor drivers were first to be eliminated, having set only one timed lap each, as were both Haas cars after them, being unable to cross the finishing line in time. The same fate caught out Daniil Kvyat, who qualified 18th. Both Sauber drivers {{were able to go}} out on a second timed lap, but proved too slow to avoid being the last to go out in Q1, after Renault rookie Jolyon Palmer was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> elimination, setting a faster time towards the end of the session.|$|E
