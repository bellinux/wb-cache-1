5|$|Brooks {{wrote for}} several shows before being {{hired as a}} story editor on My Friend Tony and later created the series Room 222. Grant Tinker hired Brooks <b>and</b> <b>Burns</b> at MTM Productions to create The Mary Tyler Moore Show in 1970. The show, {{one of the first}} to feature an {{independent}} working woman as its lead character, was critically acclaimed and won Brooks several Primetime Emmy Awards. Brooks <b>and</b> <b>Burns</b> then created two successful spin-offs from Mary Tyler Moore in the shape of Rhoda (a comedy) and Lou Grant (a drama). Brooks left MTM Productions in 1978 to co-create the sitcom Taxi which, despite winning multiple Emmys, suffered from low ratings and was canceled twice.|$|E

40|$|Education {{can play}} a {{critical}} role in moving farmers in developing countries away from environmentally harmful slash <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture. The present research examines the extent to which extension education can promote adoption of cropping systems other than slash <b>and</b> <b>burn.</b> Choice of cropping system by farmers in Cameroon, whether slash <b>and</b> <b>burn,</b> multiple crops, or mono-cropping, is modeled as a function of farm size, farmer educational level, and visits by extension personnel. Results indicate that higher visitation rates by extension personnel reduce not only the likelihood of farmers choosing slash <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture, but also promotes movement into mono-cropping. Since mono-cropping represents a move toward export-oriented agriculture in Cameroon, this movement may assist in promoting greater economic development across western Africa. Continued efforts in extension education are, therefore, critical in both reducing the environmental damage from slash <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture <b>and</b> promoting adoption of more profitable cropping systems. conservation, slash <b>and</b> <b>burn,</b> production technology, economic development, Farm Management,...|$|R

5|$|Bulk lead {{exposed to}} moist air forms a {{protective}} layer of varying composition. Lead carbonate {{is a common}} constituent; the sulfate or chloride may also be present in urban or maritime settings. This layer makes bulk lead effectively chemically inert in the air.

5|$|In August 1990, {{the band}} {{travelled}} to Florida {{to work on}} the album. Scott Burns reprised his role as producer and audio engineer, and now with a major advantage: Sepultura were at his home studio, Morrisound, a studio properly equipped to record their music style. Their label Roadrunner granted a $40,000 budget, which helped explain the album's improved production values. That allowed Igor <b>and</b> <b>Burns,</b> for example, to spend a whole week just testing the drum kit's tunings and experimenting with microphone practice.|$|E

Ecological Economics 46, 159 – 171] claims to show that slash <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture is socially inefficient and should be banned. However, its conclusions and recommendations are flawed. It defines slash <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture too broadly and misrepresents the nature and causes of the 1997 – 98 fires by virtue of attributing them entirely to slash <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture. Its economic assessment of the costs of the fires is also problematic. The recommendations to ban land-clearing fires and to provide alternative livelihoods to slash <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> farmers cannot be supported...|$|R
