5|$|An active {{vibration}} control system, {{known as the}} active control of structural response system, reduces airframe vibration by up to 80% which increases crew comfort and minimises the buildup of stress on the airframe. The cockpit is fitted with armoured seats for the crew, and can withstand an impact velocity of over 10m/s. Dual flight controls are provided, though the AW101 can be flown by <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>person.</b> The pilots' instrument displays include six full-colour high-definition screens and an optional mission display; a digital map or forward looking infrared (FLIR) display can also be installed.|$|E

Many wished to limit {{the power of the}} executive and thus supported the proposal to divide the executive power between three persons. The possible problems of this system, in addition to the knowledge that George Washington would probably be the first president, calmed the fears enough so that the proponents of a singular executive could accumulate a large coalition. This issue came up occasionally after the matter was settled, but was never again seriously doubted.|$|E

5|$|For a brief period, the Romans were in {{complete}} disarray.

As the story goes, Rome declared a national day of mourning as there was not <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>person</b> who was not either related to or acquainted with {{a person who had}} died. The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human sacrifice, twice burying people alive at the Forum of Rome and abandoning an oversized baby in the Adriatic Sea (perhaps one of the last instances of human sacrifices by the Romans, apart from public executions of defeated enemies dedicated to Mars).|$|E

5|$|George I died on 11/22 June 1727 {{during one}} of his visits to Hanover, and George II succeeded him as king and elector at the age of 43. The new king decided not to travel to Germany for his father's funeral, which far from {{bringing}} criticism led to praise from the English who considered it proof of his fondness for England. He suppressed his father's will because it attempted to split the Hanoverian succession between George II's future grandsons rather than vest all the domains (both in Britain and Hanover) in <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>person.</b> Both British and Hanoverian ministers considered the will unlawful, as George I did not have the legal power to determine the succession personally. Critics supposed that George II hid the will to avoid paying out his father's legacies.|$|E
5|$|Many {{writers have}} {{attempted}} to designate one person, often Hensley, as the progenitor of Appalachian religious snake handling. Although these writers have emphasized Hensley's role in propagating the practice, Kimbrough notes that claims that he originated it are usually unsubstantiated by research, and {{the origins of the}} observance are unclear. Hood and Williamson argue that the beginnings of Pentecostal snake handling rites cannot be ascribed to <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>person,</b> and that the observance arose independently on multiple occasions. There is no doubt among historians, however, that Hensley helped spread Pentecostal snake handling throughout the Southeast, and that media coverage of Hensley's ministry was influential in prompting various churches to include the practice in their services.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the guns were small iron guns with short range that could be aimed and fired by <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>person.</b> The two most common are the bases, breech-loading swivel guns, most likely placed in the castles, and hailshot pieces, small muzzle-loaders with rectangular bores and fin-like protrusions {{that were used to}} support the guns against the railing and allow the ship structure to take the force of the recoil.
