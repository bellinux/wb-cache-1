40|$|To clone and {{characterize}} antigens to autoantibodies in Hashimoto's thyroiditis we {{constructed a}} cDNA library in the expression vector lambda gt 11 using mRNA prepared from Grave's thyroid tissue. This library was screened using serum {{from a patient}} with Hashimoto's thyroiditis which had an <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> titer greater than 1 : 10 (6). Five positive recombinants were identified and cloned. Of these, 3 reacted with 7 of 17 normal serum samples. The 2 other clones (IL- 28 and IL- 33) reacted {{with none of the}} 17 normal serum samples. IL- 28 reacted with 4 of 15 and IL- 33 with 2 of 15 Hashimoto's thyroiditis serum samples (<b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> titers, greater than 1 : 6400). The specificity of the interaction between the Hashimoto's thyroiditis samples and the fusion protein was demonstrated by Western blot analysis. In addition, neither 10 (- 6) M human thyroglobulin nor 100 mU/ml bovine TSH inhibited binding of the serum samples to these 2 clones. Lysate from clones IL- 28 and IL- 33 did not reduce the <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> titer in a hemagglutination assay. Absorption of Hashimoto's thyroiditis serum with purified thyroid microsomes reduced the serum <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> titer, but not binding to these 2 clones. The cDNA inserts of clones IL- 28 and IL- 33 were approximately 0. 6 and 0. 4 kilobases (kb), respectively. The 0. 6 -kb IL- 28 insert was used to probe human thyroid and human liver poly(A) + mRNA. A single band of 3. 3 kb was evident only with the thyroid mRNA. The IL- 28 insert was subcloned into M 13 and sequenced in both directions by the dideoxy technique and found to be 572 basepairs in length. When tested against the GenBank and Dayhoff gene banks, no significant homology with any known sequence was determined. In summary, a cDNA fragment of a previously unrecognized gene coding for an autoimmune thyroid disease-related antigen has been cloned and partly characterized; and the protein produced by this clone is not thyroglobulin, the thyroid microsomal antigen, or the TSH-binding site of the TSH receptor. We have, therefore, identified a new autoimmune thyroid disease-related antigen, the pathogenetic significance of which remains to be determined...|$|E
40|$|To study {{autoimmunity}} among thyroid diseases, 397  thyroid patients (age 30  (13) years; M/F 75 / 322) {{from two}} referral centres in Bangladesh and 94  healthy controls (age 30  (13) years; M/F 24 / 70) were studied for antimicrosomal and antithyroglobulin antibodies. Thyroid patients were clinically grouped as suspected autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), non-autoimmune, or indeterminate groups (where no decision could be reached). <b>Antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> was strongly positive in 19. 4 % and weakly positive in 7. 3 % of patients but only 4. 3 % and 2. 1 % respectively in the controls (χ 2  =  17. 852; p =  0. 000) whereas strong and weak positivity were 27. 2 % and 6. 8 % in patients compared with 8. 5 % and 4. 3 % respectively in the controls (χ 2  =  16. 916; p =  0. 000) for antithyroglobulin antibody. Antibodies were positive in 63. 0 % with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, 36. 4 % with Graves' disease, and 44. 7 % with atrophic thyroiditis among the autoimmune group. In the non-autoimmune group antibodies were positive in 100 % with multinodular hypothyroidism, 46. 7 % with subacute thyroiditis, 40. 0 % with suspected iodine deficiency goitre, 31. 3 % with toxic multinodular goitre, 30. 8 % with non-toxic solitary nodules, and 19. 4 % with simple diffuse goitre. None was positive for <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> without being positive for antithyroglobulin antibody. The two antibodies strongly correlated in both patients (r =  0. 977, p =  0. 000) and controls (r =  0. 986, p =  0. 000). About 9 % (36 / 397) of patients were mismatched {{with the final}} diagnosis on antibody measurement; {{most of them had}} Hashimoto's thyroiditis (33 / 36). Prevalence of AITD among thyroid patients was 48. 36 %. Specificity of antimicrosomal and antithyroglobulin antibodies were 93 % and 87 %. It was concluded that AITD is not uncommon in Bangladesh; <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> is a useful marker for AITD and unless antibodies are checked, an appreciable number of patients with AITDs will remain undetected.    Keywords: thyroid autoimmunity; diagnostic dilemm...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThyroid {{storm is}} a rare but {{life-threatening}} condition, which can be induced by many critical diseases. We reported a 40 -year-old woman with thyroid goiter manifesting with acute sepsis-induced hyperthyroidism. She mainly presented with abdominal bloating, diarrhea, lower limbs edema and exertional dyspnea. The lactate was 9. 5  mmol/L and procalcitonin was 3. 8  ng/mL, suggesting acute sepsis. The thyroid echo showed bilateral thyroid goiter. Relevant data included a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0. 03  μIU/mL; free tetraiodothyronine, 5. 67  ng/dL; thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody, 76. 9 % (normal range, <  14 %); and <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> titer, 1 : 102400 (normal range, <  1 : 100), suggesting toxic goiter with thyroid storm. Piperacillin/tazobactam, methimazole and Lugol's iodine achieved a good outcome. The symptoms of early sepsis and those of thyroid storm could be similar.

40|$|We {{examined}} the thyroid status of 58 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) using total serum thyroxin, thyroid hormone binding ratio, free thyroxin index, serum TSH, antithyroglobulin, and <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Seven patients {{were known to}} be hypothyroid prior to the diagnosis of PBC. Six additional patients were found to have biochemical evidence of hypothyroidism. The prevalence of hypothyroidism was 12 % if we include only those six PBC patients with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism or 22 % if we include all 13 patients. Five of the 58 patients had evidence for an elevation of thyroid hormone binding capacity. Three hypothyroid patients had normal total thyroxins with low thyroid hormone binding ratios. Two euthyroid patients had elevated total T 4 s with low thyroid hormone binding ratio and normal FTI. The prevalence of positive <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibodies</b> was 34 %, including 11 euthyroid PBC patients. The prevalence of positive antithyroglobulin antibodies was 20 % including five euthyroid patients. There was no association between HLA DR 3 or DR 5 and the patients with hypothyroidism and/ or antithyroid antibodies. Because fatigue, lethargy, and anorexia as well as hypercholesterolemia are common features of both hypothyroidism and PBC, patients with PBC should be screened for evidence of thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid disease may precede the diagnosis of PBC by several years. Therefore, the development of cholestatic liver disease in a patient with known autoimmune thyroiditis should arouse suspicion of PBC...|$|R
40|$|Graves' disease, {{the main}} cause of {{hyperthyroidism}} in the pediatric age group, is very rare in children younger than 4 years old but can seriously interfere with growth and development if not recognized and treated. Here we report a case of a 3 -year-old girl with Graves' disease who presented with goiter, exophthalmos, heat intolerance, and hyperactivity. At her first visit, her serum concentrations of triiodothyronine (T 3) and free thyroxine (free T 4) were normal, whereas that of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was decreased. <b>Antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> was 7, 053. 94 IU/mL, and TSH-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin was 31. 62 %.

40|$|In 1971, thyroid {{function}} was evaluated in 15 unselected patients whose only therapy for diffuse toxic goiter was {{a course of}} thionamide drug treatment completed 20 - 27 yr earlier. One patient was frankly hypothyroid by clinical and laboratory criteria. The remaining 14 patients appeared clinically euthyroid and had a normal serum thyroxine (T 4) concentration and thyroid radioiodine uptake (RAIU). Nevertheless, only 6 of 14 appeared to be entirely normal according to more refined criteria. The serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration was markedly elevated in one patient and above the normal range (1. 6 ± 2. 0; mean± 2 SD) in five others. Thyroid stimulation with exogenous TSH revealed subnormal responses of the serum T 4 I, RAIU, or both, in 7 of 11 patients tested.

40|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) can either cause or eliminate autoimmune disease. Here, we report two cases. One was a 33 -year-old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anemia) who received {{bone marrow transplantation}} from her human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -identical sister who {{had a history of}} Graves' disease. Antithyroid antibodies, including <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> and antithy-roglobulin antibody, appeared 4 months after transplantation. Clinical hyperthyroidism appeared 7 months after transplantation, and a hypothyroid state was noted 2 months later. The other case was a 50 -year-old woman with Sjögren's syndrome and hypothyroidism who was diagnosed with peripheral T cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. She received allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from her histocompatible sister owing to only partial response to traditional chemotherapy. Cure of lymphoma and remission of Sjögren's syndrome was noted 4 years after PBSCT. These two illustrative cases, one of acquisition of hyperthyroidism and the other of remission of Sjögren's syndrome after transplantation, highlights that HSCT can induce adoptive autoimmune disease or cure coincidental autoimmune disease.

Subsequently the patient presented with constantly raised IgA in serum and positive antinuclear and thyroid <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibodies.</b> The diagnosis of probable autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome was made; arthritis, skin and throat blisters, which appeared subsequently led to the diagnosis of linear IgA disease. On the basis of these unique associations, the Authors hypothesized that autoimmunity may be partly responsible of the severe epileptic symptomatology, perhaps mediated by autoantibodies against sodium channels or by accompanying cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.

40|$|The role of {{transplacental}} {{transfer of}} maternal thyrotrophin (TSH) -blocking antibodies causing congenital hypothyroidism in Southern Chinese children was {{examined in this}} study. Twenty-two mothers of 24 patients with congenital hypothyroidism were studied 3 - 5 years after delivery. None of them had thyroid dysfunction at delivery or {{at the time of}} study. None had antithyroglobulin or <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody.</b> Only one mother was found to have TSH-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII), and her child had agenesis of the thyroid. This woman had Graves' disease in remission for 2 years before delivery. None had TSH-stimulated cAMP response inhibitory immunoglobulin (TSII). Ten of the 24 congenital hypothyroid children had transient neonatal hypothyroidism, seven had agenesis of the thyroid, six had dyshormonogenesis and one had a sublingual thyroid. As none of the mothers who had children with transient neonatal hypothyroidism had blocking antibodies at the time of study, the aetiology of the transient neonatal hypothyroidism remains unclear.

40|$|Recombinant, enzymatically active human thyroid {{peroxidase}} (hTPO) {{generated in}} nonthyroidal eukaryotic cells was compared with Graves' thyroid microsomes {{as a source}} of antigen for the immunological detection of antimicrosomal/anti-hTPO antibodies. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of 51 sera, selected to produce a balanced distribution of <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> (anti-MSA) levels, revealed (at 1 : 100 serum dilution) a moderately good correlation between anti-MSA and anti-hTPO antibody levels (r = 0. 668; P < 0. 001). However, a number of sera with high anti-MSA levels yielded markedly discordant values between the two assays. A much lower correlation was observed between antithyroglobulin and anti-hTPO antibody levels (r = 0. 315;P < 0. 05). At higher serum dilutions (1 : 1, 000 and 1 : 10, 000), at which low affinity, high capacity binding reactions will be reduced, the correlation between anti-MSA and anti-hTPO antibody values was greatly improved (r = 0. 906 and 0. 902, respectively; P < 0. 001), and there were no longer widely discrepant values between the two assays. In summary, the present study indicates that recombinant hTPO expressed in nonthyroidal cells provides an unlimited source of human TPO of unvarying quality for anti-hTPO antibody assays. This material offers increased specificity over standard anti-MSA assays that use thyroid cell microsomes as antigen...|$|E
40|$|PurposeWe {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the predictive factors for early response to methimazole (MMI) in pediatric patients with Graves disease (GD). MethodsOur study included 44 pediatric patients who were diagnosed with GD between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2013, and were available for follow-up, achieving a normalization of thyroid functions (TFs) at the Chonbuk National University Hospital Pediatric Department. We retrospectively analyzed TFs such as tri-iodothyronine (T 3), free thyroxine (fT 4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroid antibody levels at diagnosis. We also examined their family history of thyroid disease, symptoms at presentation, and normalization time for TF after treatment. We divided our clinical series of patients into the following 4 age groups: < 7 years old, 7 – 12 years old, 13 – 15 years old, and 16 – 18 years old. ResultsAt diagnosis, the time of normalization of T 3 was significantly shorter in the higher <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> (AMA) group compared with the lower AMA group (2. 53 months vs. 6. 18 months) (P< 0. 05). However, the time of normalization of T 3 /fT 4 /TSH had no significant correlations with other variables such as age, sex, {{a family history of}} thyroid diseases, thyroglobulin, thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, or antithyroglobulin antibody (ATA).

40|$|BACKGROUND Hyperthyroidism {{can result}} in ocular manifestations even before {{systemic}} signs and symptoms develop. It is seen more in females and severe forms are more common in males. Early detection of ocular involvement can prevent vision threatening complications and troublesome discomforts affecting quality of vision. This clinical study {{highlights the importance of}} detailed ocular examination in hyperthyroidism. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty consecutive patients with ocular signs of hyperthyroidism were evaluated and followed up for an average period of 1 year. Detailed ocular examination included exophthalmometric measurements, ocular movements and Worth four-dot test. T 3, T 4, TSH, CT scan and <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibodies</b> and antithyroglobulin antibodies were done along with routine investigations. Study Design- Prospective cohort study. RESULTS Statistical analysis did not reveal any correlation between the level of serum T 3 and severity of ocular findings. Majority of the cases were euthyroid with moderate ocular myopathy having multiple muscle involvement. Inferior rectus was affected most.

40|$|Hashimoto's {{encephalopathy}} (HE) is {{a controversial}} neurological disorder that comprises a heterogenous group of neurological symptoms that manifest {{in patients with}} high titers of antithyroid antibodies. Clinical manifestations of HE may include encephalopathic features such as seizures, behavioral and psychiatric manifestations, movement disorders, and coma. Although it {{has been linked to}} cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis or thyroid dysfunction, the most common immunological feature of HE is the presence of high titers of antithyroglobulin or anti-TPO (<b>antimicrosomal)</b> <b>antibodies.</b> At present, it is unclear whether antithyroid antibodies represent an immune epiphenomenon in a subset of patients with encephalopathic processes or they are really associated with pathogenic mechanisms of the disorder. The responsiveness of HE to steroids or other therapies such as plasmapheresis supports the hypothesis that this is a disorder that involves immune pathogenic mechanisms. Further controlled studies of the use of steroids, plasmapheresis, or immunosuppressant medications are needed in the future to prove the concept of the pathogenic role of antithyroid antibodies in HE. A case of Hashimoto’s encephalopathy presenting as a seizure is presented here for its rarity...|$|R
40|$|Over a 7 -year period {{transient}} hyperthyroidism {{was diagnosed}} in 35 patients {{seen in a}} consulting practice in a community hospital. The patients were followed up {{for an average of}} 15 months. Initially all of them had biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism but a very low 24 -hour uptake of radioiodine. The hyperthyroid phase was short, and there were no relapses. Seventeen patients subsequently became hypothyroid; this phase, too, was almost always transient. The clinical course of the disease in the 11 women who became hyperthyroid within 6 months after giving birth was similar to that experienced by the other patients, but of the 11 who had increased titres of <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibodies</b> a significantly greater proportion (73 %) showed at least transient evidence of hypothyroidism; 1 patient remained frankly hypothyroid for a year. Transient hyperthyroidism can be distinguished from Graves' disease only if the uptake of radioiodine is measured. It is important to make this distinction, as transient hyperthyroidism can be managed safely and symptomatically with beta-blockers alone. The propensity of this disease for the postpartum period and the high proportion of patients with antithyroid antibodies suggest an autoimmune cause...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the effect of}} administration of repeated doses of sodium ipodate in a newborn infant with hyperthyroidism due to transient Graves' disease. Pretreatment (day 3) serum T 4 and T 3 concentrations were 49 μg/dl and 590 ng/dl, respectively. With 24 h after the first dose of ipodate, serum T 3 fell by 40 %, and it subsequently ranged from 209 - 278 ng/dl throughout the 39 -day ipodate treatment period. Serum T 4 also decreased after ipodate administration to 69 % and 41 % of the pretreatment value after 72 h and 7 days of treatment, respectively; values thereafter during treatment ranged from 19 - 22 μg/dl. These plateau values are in the upper range of normal for the neonatal period. Rapid clinical improvement occurred as the hyperiodothyroninemia abated. Serum rT 3 concentrations increased from 468 - 672 ng/dl to greater than 1400 ng/dl 24 h after each ipodate. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin was present in maternal and cord sera, and the half-life of serum thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin in the infant was approximately 12 days. Antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibodies {{were present in the}} infant at 10 days of age, and the titers decreased progressively thereafter; the half-life for the <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> titer was 3 weeks.

40|$|A {{full-length}} cDNA clone {{for human}} thyroid peroxidase (TPO) {{inserted into the}} mammalian cell expression vector pECE was stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Clones were assayed for human TPO mRNA, TPO protein, and TPO enzymatic activity. One subclone, expressing the highest TPO enzymatic activity, was used in further studies. FACS analysis of these cells preincubated in Hashimoto's serum revealed approximately 100 -fold greater fluorescence compared with controls, indicating that recombinant TPO is expressed on the cell surface. Particulate antigen was extracted from these cells and studied by Western blot analysis using a panel of Hashimoto's sera of known <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> (anti-MSA) titer. Under nonreducing conditions a broad, immunoreactive band of approximately 200 kD was observed, {{as well as a}} doublet of approximately 110 kD. All of the 36 Hashimoto's sera tested reacted with these bands, most in proportion to their anti-MSA titer. Six normal sera tested against this antigen(s) were nonreactive, as were the Hashimoto's sera tested against nontransfected CHO cells. Western blots under reducing conditions revealed a considerably diminished signal, with some of the sera of lower anti-MSA titer becoming negative, the loss of the 200 -kD broad band, and the apparent conversion of the 110 -kD doublet into a single band. Preincubation of cells in tunicamycin revealed no decrease in TPO immunoreactivity. In conclusion, we expressed enzymatically active human TPO in nonthyroidal eukaryotic cells. Our data prove that functionally active TPO is a major component of the thyroid microsomal antigen...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Clinical, biochemical, ultrasonographic, {{radionuclide}} and cytomorphological {{observations in}} Lymphocytic thyroiditis (LT), {{to define the}} cytological grading criteria on smears and correlation of grades with above parameters. Methods This prospective study was conducted on 76 patients attending the Fine needle aspiration cytology clinic of a tertiary care institute in North India. The various parameters like patients' clinical presentation, thyroid antimicrosomal antibodies, hormonal profiles, radionuclide thyroid scan and thyroid ultrasound were studied. Fine needle aspiration of thyroid gland and grading of thyroiditis was done on smears. The grades were correlated with above parameters and the correlation indices were evaluated statistically. Results Most of the patients were females (70, 92. 11 %) who presented with a diffuse goiter (68, 89. 47 %). Hypothyroid features (56, 73. 68 %) and elevated TSH (75, 98. 68 %) were common, but radioiodide uptake was low or normal in majority of patients. Thyroid <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> was elevated in 46 / 70 (65. 71 %) patients. Cytomorphology in fine needle aspirates was diagnostic of lymphocytic thyroiditis in 75 (98. 68 %) patients. Most of them had grade I/II disease by cytology. No correlation was observed between grades of cytomorphology and clinical, biochemical, ultrasonographic and radionuclide parameters. Conclusion Despite the availability of several tests for diagnosis of LT, FNAC remains the gold standard. The grades of thyroiditis at cytology however do not correlate with clinical, biochemical, radionuclide and ultrasonographic parameters. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Hashimoto's {{thyroiditis}} is {{a common}} form of chronic autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and often coexists with other autoimmune diseases, but Hashimoto’s thyroiditis associated with an autosomal dominant neurofibromatosis type 1 is exceedingly rare. Case Presentation. A 30 -year-old Bengali woman presented to the OPD with complaints of aching pain and tingling sensation {{in her hands and}} feet. Physical examination revealed dysmorphic facies, nodular swelling in the neck, cafe-au-lait spots, and neurofibromas covering the entire surface of her body. Her thyroid hormones were within normal limits. Thyroid ultrasound revealed a cystic area in the left lobe of the gland, and ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology revealed lymphocytic infiltration of the gland, suggesting Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. High levels of autoimmune antibodies such as antithyroglobulin and <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibodies</b> confirmed the diagnosis. Conclusion. When encountered with a patient of Neurofibromatosis type 1, a physician should be careful {{about the possibility of a}} concomitant autoimmune disease. Clinical presentation of neurofibromatosis and Noonan syndrome often overlaps and recent studies have implicated a mutation in NF 1 gene in the etiology of NFNS. More extensive reports and further investigations of such patients having combination of neurofibromatosis type 1 and autoimmune thyroiditis will certainly provide better understanding of this link in the near future...|$|R

In the first phase the mean serum iodothyronine levels were within normal limits, nevertheless elevated T 3 and T 4 levels were detected in 34 (54 %) and 20 (32 %) patients, respectively. The next phase was characterized by normal serum iodothyronine levels; TRH stimulation test, however, showed a significant increase of pituitary TSH reserve in 35 (56 %) patients.

40|$|Background: Iodine {{deficiency}} disorders (IDD) are {{widespread in}} China. Presently, IDD {{have been put}} under control by Universal Salt Iodisation (USI) in China; however, {{there is a lack}} of evidence on whether the iodine status in adults, pregnant women and lactating women is optimal. This study was therefore conducted to assess the iodine nutrition and thyroid function of children, adults, pregnant women and lactating women residing in areas where the USI program is fully established. Design: Six areas were selected according to the geographical regions in China. In each of these areas, we selected 4 distinct groups of subjects (children, adults, pregnant women and lactating women) in regions where the coverage rate of iodised salt was more than 95 % and the levels of iodine and fluoride in drinking water were less than or equal to 10 µg/L and 1 mg/L, respectively.

Methods: This prospective study was conducted on 76 patients attending the Fine needle aspiration cytology clinic of a tertiary care institute in North India. The various parameters like patients&#x 2032; clinical presentation, thyroid antimicrosomal antibodies, hormonal profiles, radionuclide thyroid scan and thyroid ultrasound were studied. Fine needle aspiration of thyroid gland and grading of thyroiditis was done on smears. The grades were correlated with above parameters and the correlation indices were evaluated statistically. Results: Most of the patients were females (70, 92. 11 &#x 0025;) who presented with a diffuse goiter (68, 89. 47 &#x 0025;). Hypothyroid features (56, 73. 68 &#x 0025;) and elevated TSH (75, 98. 68 &#x 0025;) were common, but radioiodide uptake was low or normal in majority of patients. Thyroid <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> was elevated in 46 / 70 (65. 71 &#x 0025;) patients. Cytomorphology in fine needle aspirates was diagnostic of lymphocytic thyroiditis in 75 (98. 68 &#x 0025;) patients. Most of them had grade I/II disease by cytology. No correlation was observed between grades of cytomorphology and clinical, biochemical, ultrasonographic and radionuclide parameters. Conclusion: Despite the availability of several tests for diagnosis of LT, FNAC remains the gold standard. The grades of thyroiditis at cytology however do not correlate with clinical, biochemical, radionuclide and ultrasonographic parameters...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} possible immunological mechanisms {{involved in}} the development of postpartum thyroiditis with transient hyperthyroidism followed by transient hypothyroidism (PPT), antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO), <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> (AMA) related immunoglobin G subclass and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) were studied in 43 post-partum (PP) women who were euthyroid at delivery and completed a subsequent 1 year follow up. Among the 25 mothers who developed PPT, 14 had positive AMA (PPT:AMA+) and 11 negative AMA (PPT:AMA-) at delivery. Among the 18 mothers who remained euthyroid (E) up to one year post-partum and were used as controls, 8 were AMA positive (E:AMA+) and 10 AMA negative (E:AMA-) at delivery. AMA measured by a hemagglutination method correlated well with anti-TPO antibodies measured by RIA in the PP mothers studied. When AMA-related IgG subclass activity was analysed comparing PPT women with appropriate euthyroid controls at the different time intervals studied, it was seen that PPT:AMA+ when compared to E:AMA+ women have significantly increased activity of AMA related IgG 1 at all PP time intervals studied (p less than 0. 001), but IgG 4 was only increased at 5 - 7 months PP (p less than 0. 05). PPT:AMA-when compared to E:AMA- have significantly increased IgG 4 at 2 - 4 (p less than 0. 001), 5 - 7 and 10 - 12 (p less than 0. 05) months PP, but IgG 1 is only increased at 5 - 7 months PP (p less than 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{the frequency and}} significance of thyroid auto-antibodies and antinuclear antibody among Saudi patients with chronic urticaria and to identify markers of chronic urticaria disease. Materials and methodsNon-interventional, prospective analytical study carried out among consecutive patients with chronic urticaria in the Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia between January 2005 and December 2007. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups: Group 1 – with hypothyroidism, Group 2 – without hypothyroidism, both age-matched to normal healthy controls. All patients were investigated for the presence of antithyroglobulin (ATG), <b>antimicrosomal</b> (AMA), antinuclear <b>antibodies</b> (ANA) as well as rheumatoid factor (RF) and antibodies to hepatitis B and C. ResultsA total of 90 participants were included in the study. Significant elevation of anti thyroglobulin antibodies was found in patients with hypothyroidism than in those without hypothyroidism and in the control group (30. 4 % vs. 24. 4 % vs. nil, p= 0. 022). Elevated titers of <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibodies</b> were seen in chronic urticaria patients with or without hypothyroidism compared to control group. Positive antinuclear antibodies were detected in all groups. There {{were no significant differences in}} the severity of the disease in between study groups (p= 0. 234). Chronic urticaria was statistically significantly associated with hypothyroidism (p= 0. 0014) and with the presence of antithyroglobulin antibodies (p= 0. 022). The duration of urticaria was significantly associated with positive antithyroid and anti-nuclear antibodies (p= 0. 0315 and p= 0. 0056, respectively). Disease severity was not significantly associated with elevations of ANA, TMA and TGA titers (p= 0. 558, 0. 827 and 0. 324, respectively). ConclusionChronic immunologic urticaria may be entertained in patients with long standing urticaria especially in the presence of hypothyroidism and elevated antithyroid antibodies. Assays for thyroid antibodies, TSH and ANA may be justified for early diagnosis of autoimmune urticaria to institute appropriate treatment modalities, hence improve the quality of life...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn recent years, many {{authors have}} {{described}} several cases revealing {{an association between}} hyperthyroidism and pulmonary hypertension (PH). This observational {{study was designed to}} evaluate the incidence of PH in hyperthyroidism and was set in a department of internal medicine and pulmonary diseases with an out-patients department of endocrinology. Thirty-four patients, 25 women and nine men, {{with a mean age of}} 38 ± 15 SD years participated. Twenty had Graves' disease and 14 had a nodular goitre. The patients were divided into two equally matched groups: those with a recently diagnosed hyperthyroidism, taking no drugs (group 1; n= 17) and those in a euthyroid state taking methimazole (group 2; n= 17). Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography was performed and systolic pulmonary artery pressurements of (PAPs) was determined by the tricuspid regurgitation method using the Bernoulli equation. Measurements of triiodothyronine, tetraiodothyronine, free thyroxine (Ft 4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and antithyroglobulin and <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibodies</b> were also taken. We found a mild PH in seven patients of group 1 and in none of group 2. The mean±SD systolic pulmonary artery pressure was 28 · 88 ± 6 · 41 in group 1 and 22 · 53 ± 1 · 84 in group 2 (P< 0 · 0001). A correlation was found between the TSH value and PAPs (r=− 0 · 82;P< 0 · 001) and Ft 4 and PAPs (r= 0 · 85;P< 0 · 001) in group 1. These findings indicate the presence of a frequent association between PH and hyperthyroidism. We suggest that hyperthyroidism be included in the differential diagnosis of PH...|$|R
40|$|Inherited {{defects in}} {{detoxification}} of reactive metabolites of drugs predispose patients to "hypersensitivity" reactions. Covalent interaction of metabolites with cell macromolecules leads to cytotoxic and immunologic outcomes, manifested clinically by multisystem syndromes with variable organ involvement. Hypothyroidism developed in 5 of 202 patients (age range, 1 to 81 years) we investigated for hypersensitivity reactions to anticonvulsants or sulfonamides shortly after their reaction. None had previous personal or family histories of autoimmune disease. All had low thyroxine levels, {{elevated levels of}} thyroid stimulating hormone, and autoantibodies including <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Patients were 2 to 18 years of age at presentation, and two were male. All returned to a euthyroid state {{within a year of}} presentation, and all remain well. The demographics, clinical presentation, and course of the patients is atypical of idiopathic lymphocytic thyroiditis. We investigated the pathogenesis of thyroid toxicity using the hydroxylamine metabolite of sulfamethoxazole as a model. The hydroxyalmine was toxic to thyroid cells in vitro, which did or did not express thyroid peroxidase activity, whereas the parent sulfonamide was toxic only to cells with active thyroid peroxidase. The purified enzyme converted sulfamethoxazole to the hydroxylamine. Formation of reactive drug metabolites by thyroid peroxidase in a host who is genetically unable to detoxify the metabolites may lead directly to cytotoxicity. Covalent binding to macromolecules, including thyroid peroxidase, also may lead to expression of neoantigens and formation of autoantibodies. Patients who have sustained hypersensitivity reactions to drugs should be investigated for possible involvement of the thyroid.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the link between excess iodine intake as evidenced by increased urinary iodine excretion (UIE) and autoimmune thyroiditis in children and to assess the correlation between UIE and thyroid microsomal antibody (thyroid peroxidase [TPO]) titers in children. Materials and Methods: All children with goiter between age group 6 and 12 years, were subjected to blood tests for free thyroxine, thyroid stimulating hormone, and TPO antibody, fine needle aspiration was advised for all children with goiter. Forty-three children with confirmed autoimmune thyroiditis served as cases, and 43 children with euthyroid goiter with workup negative for autoimmune thyroiditis and iodine deficiency were enrolled as controls. UIE was estimated in spot urine sample for both cases and controls. The levels of urinary iodine were compared between cases and controls. Results: The levels of urinary iodine were significantly higher in children with autoimmune thyroiditis as compared with control. There was a positive correlation between UIE and <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> titers among cases. Among cases 65 % children had subclinical hypothyroidism, 27. 9 % had overt hypothyroidism and 7 % of cases, and 100 % of controls had euthyroid functional status. Excessive (≥ 300 μg/L) UIE was strongly associated with autoimmune thyroiditis. If the UIE level is ≥ 300 μg/L, then there is 17. 94 times higher chance of having amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis than those who have UIE level < 300 μg/L (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: A possible association between increased iodine intake and autoimmune thyroiditis was found in this study. Excessive iodine intake may trigger thyroid autoimmunity and eventually thyroid hypofunction...|$|E
40|$|The titres of anti-alpha-galactosyl {{antibodies}} {{were measured}} by passive haemagglutination in 50 control subjects and in 128 patients presenting with various thyroid disorders. Titres of control subjects ranged from 1 / 10 to 1 / 80, {{regardless of age}} and blood group. Elevated titres (greater than 1 / 80) were constantly noted in 6 / 6 patients with progressive exophthalmos, in 5 / 5 patients with untreated Graves' disease, and in 11 / 12 patients with progressive nontoxic goitre. By contrast, the titres were within the normal range in primary myxoedema (17 patients) and in residual exophthalmos (11 patients), whereas they were only erratically increased in 1 / 31 patients with treated or cured Graves' disease and in 5 / 36 patients with nonprogressive nontoxic goitre. Finally, elevated titres were also found in 3 / 7 patients presenting with autoimmune thyroiditis. No correlations could be established between elevated titres and the thyrotropin binding inhibiting immunoglobulin activity, the antithyroglobulin antibody titres or the <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> titres. As in the control subjects, the anti-alpha-galactosyl antibodies mainly belonged to the IgG class. Affinity purified anti-alpha-galactosyl antibodies were capable of binding to trypsinized human and porcine thyroid cells in culture, as shown by indirect immunofluorescence. On the other hand, {{they were not able}} to react with untreated thyroid cells. The data show that the measurement of anti-alpha-galactosyl antibody titres could represent an easy and useful tool to determine whether an autoimmune thyroid disorder is in progression. Besides, they suggest that some of the antigenic determinants implicated in the enhanced production of anti-alpha-galactosyl antibodies are present, but normally hidden, within the cell surface of thyroid cells.

40|$|Neck {{masses in}} {{children}} are a frequent occurrence and can often create a diagnostic dilemma. In {{such a situation}} the clinical history and physical examination are important. A thyroid lesion which is rapidly enlarging, firm and non-tender, associated with additional symptoms such as hoarseness, stridor, dyspnoea or dysphagia should alert the clinician to a potentially malignant lesion, particularly in the euthyroid patient. The case presented illustrates many of these primary features; however {{there was a strong}} family history of autoimmune thyroid disease which could have been misleading. The imaging findings suggested the need for urgent histological investigation which led to a prompt diagnosis being made. CASE REPORT. A thirteen year old boy noted a swelling in {{the left side of his}} neck upon waking one morning, whilst on holiday. He attended the Accident and Emergency department of the nearest hospital and he was referred for an ultrasound scan. His parents were informed that his thyroid gland was "enlarged " and they were advised to seek further help on their return from holiday. A week later he attended the Rapid Response Clinic at The Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children. His neck swelling had not changed in size appreciably during this time and he did not complain of any systemic symptoms. The patient's mother stated that there was a strong history of autoimmune thyroid disease in the family, with three maternal relatives having hypothyroidism and the patient ' s maternal grandfather having suffered from hyperthyroidism. Clinically and serologically the patient was euthyroid, and his thyroid <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibody</b> levels were not elevated. A repeat ultrasound scan was requested (see figure 1). The scan showed an heterogeneous, solid mass arising in the left lobe of the gland, which was surrounded by a compressed rim of more normal thyroid tissue. The mass measured ss_. 2 EX [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Biochemical {{hypothyroidism}} (BH) after hemithyroidectomy is an under-recognized complication with {{a reported}} incidence of 9 % to 43 %. This study aimed to identify potential clinicopathologic risk {{factors associated with}} early (< 12 months after hemithyroidectomy) and late-onset (≥ 12 months after hemithyroidectomy) BH. Methods: From 2005 to 2008 there were 263 postsurgical patients who were eligible for analysis. Serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level was checked regularly after surgery. Postoperative TSH reaching a level higher than 5. 5 mIU/L was defined as BH. The overall median follow-up period was 21 months (range, 362 mo). Any clinicopathologic factors significantly associated with BH in the univariate analysis were entered into multivariate analysis. A further analysis was performed comparing factors between early and late-onset BH. Results: There were 38 patients who developed subsequent BH, 33 of these cases developed within 2 years. Those patients with BH were significantly older (P =. 037), had a higher preoperative TSH level (P <. 001), longer follow-up period (P <. 001), more frequent thyroiditis on histology (P =. 043), lighter resected tissue weight (P =. 001), {{and were more likely}} to have positive <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibodies</b> (P =. 043) than those without BH. However, in the multivariate analysis after adjusting for different follow-up periods in the 2 groups, only lighter resected tissue weight (P =. 036) and concomitant thyroiditis on histology (P =. 005) turned out to be independent factors for BH. Thyroiditis on histology was also the only significant risk factor for developing early onset BH. Conclusions: Patients with lighter resected tissue weight and concomitant thyroiditis on histology were particularly at risk for subsequent BH. Although not all patients with thyroiditis developed BH, in those who did develop BH it occurred within the first 11 months. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|INTRODUCTION IPEX syndrome, namely, a {{hereditary}} (X-linked) immunodysregulation with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy and enteropathy, as {{the basic}} manifestations, presents a rare and exceptionally severe disease. It develops due to gene mutation responsible for the synthesis of a specific protein (FOXP 3), which, by differentiation and activation of regular T-lymphocytic CD 4 +CD 25 +, has the {{key role in the}} induction and maintenance of the peripheral tolerance of one's own tissue. CASE OUTLINE We present a male infant with classic clinical features of IPEX syndrome, which manifested {{by the end of the}} first month after birth, first with type 1 diabetes mellitus and chronic diarrhoea followed by dehydration and disordered development, and then with facial eczema and laboratory signs of thyroiditis without thyroid dysfunction (antithyreoglobulin antibodies 1 : 5500, <b>antimicrosomal</b> <b>antibodies</b> 1 : 40). In addition, plasma IgE level was high (517 IU/l), while antibodies to tissue transglutaminase were mildly increased (IgA 7. 5 U/ml), and anti-smooth muscle and anti-DNA antibodies were absent. Based on the typical clinical features, as well as the laboratory findings, IPEX syndrome was diagnosed, which was further confirmed by proved IVS 7 + 5 G>A mutations in the FOXP 3 gene. Therapy with insulin and Pronison, combined with parenteral and semielementary nutrition resulted in the patient's clinical improvement. At the age of 9 months, despite Pronison and hypoallergenic nutrition, the child had a relapse of severe and persistent diarrhoeal disorder followed by dehydration, weight loss and deterioration of general condition. Beside the complete parenteral nutrition, as well as other measures, azathioprine was introduced into the treatment, but without the desired effect. At the age of 12. 5 months, due to bacteraemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation as complications, the patient ended lethally. CONCLUSION IPEX syndrome should be kept in mind in all the cases of associated type 1 diabetes mellitus and chronic diarrhoea in male neonates or infants. Although treatment results have still been modest, it is quite certain they will be far better in the near future...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a case of}} hypothyroidism in a patient with Waldenström's disease in which the evidence of thyroid failure was accompanied by an abnormal binding of thyroid hormones in the gamma-globulin fraction. A 68 -yr-old patient with Waldenström's disease appeared to be hypothyroid by clinical and laboratory criteria. Serum TSH was elevated; serum T 3 (measured by RIA) was low, while T 4 levels were undetectable or very high according to the method used. Serum free thyroid hormones were in the hypothyroid range, and both antithyroglobulin and <b>antimicrosomal</b> thyroid <b>antibodies</b> were undetectable. The thyroid gland was normal at autopsy. Elevated binding of radiolabeled thyroid hormones by the patient's serum gamma-globulins was demonstrated by reverse flow electrophoresis and cellulose acetate electrophoresis. This binding could be inhibited by preincubation of serum samples with unlabeled T 4 and T 3, but not with human thyroglobulin, rT 3, DIT, or MIT. Immunoprecipitation of the patient's serum incubated with [125 I]T 4 or [125 I]T 3 showed that 56...|$|R
