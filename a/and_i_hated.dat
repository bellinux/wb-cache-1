500|$|The group parted with Heart Management in March 1995 {{because of}} their {{frustration}} with the management company's unwillingness {{to listen to their}} visions and ideas. The girls met with artist manager Simon Fuller, who signed them with 19 Entertainment. The group considered a variety of record labels, and signed a deal with Virgin Records in July. The original mix of [...] "Wannabe" [...] was considered lacklustre by the label's executives. Ashley Newton, {{who was in charge of}} A, sent the song to American producer Dave Way for remixing; the result was not what the group had hoped to achieve. As Halliwell later described it, [...] "the result was bloody awful." [...] She elaborated in her second autobiography, Just for the Record: [...] "Right at the beginning of the Spice Girls, [...] Ashley Newton had tried to turn us into an R group. He sent [...] "Wannabe" [...] over to America to be remixed by some hot R producers. He brought us jungle versions and hip-hop mixes <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> them all. Although Mel B was a big fan of R, she agreed with me that these versions just didn't work so we exercised our Spice veto!" [...] Fuller gave the song to audio engineer Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent, who thought that it was a [...] "weird pop record." [...] Stent remixed it in six hours, in what he described as [...] "tightening it up" [...] and [...] "getting the vocals sounding really good." ...|$|E

2500|$|Around {{the age of}} three, Maria's musical talent {{began to}} {{manifest}} itself, and after Evangelia discovered that her youngest daughter also had a voice, she began pressing [...] "Mary" [...] to sing. Callas later recalled, [...] "I was made to sing when I was only five, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> it." [...] George was unhappy with his wife favoring their elder daughter, {{as well as the}} pressure put upon young Mary to sing and perform. The marriage continued to deteriorate and in 1937 Evangelia decided to return to Athens with her two daughters.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{satisfied}} with the album's keyboard-dominated production nor the band's commercialized image, John Norum decided to leave Europe in November 1986 to pursue a solo career. [...] "I didn't really like the direction the band was going in," [...] Norum said, [...] "We became this teeny-bopper, bubblegum band <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> that whole image, the spandex, poodle-rock type of thing. I was more into the heavier, guitar-oriented stuff {{and it seemed like}} the keyboards were taking over more and more, and we were becoming more commercial. So I decided to leave. I just wanted to move on and do something else." ...|$|E

He wasn't afraid to yell and get on my toes to do my job because he hated to lose <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> to lose. He made me the hungriest guy on the race track." ...|$|E
