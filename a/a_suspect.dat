5|$|Although {{generally}} regarded as somewhat of a rival of J.R. in the fictional world of Dallas, Gary Ewing (Ted Shackelford) was not <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> due to his activity in the related fictional Knots Landing world. Similarly, Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton) had an alibi provided by liaisons with a married college professor.|$|E

5|$|Hal Rogers's brother John {{was also}} {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> {{even though he}} was in state prison serving a sentence for the rape of a woman who had shared his trailer, {{at the time of the}} murders. Police, investigating the woman's rape allegation, found evidence indicating that he had also sexually assaulted Hal's daughter Michelle, although charges involving this assault were later dropped because of her reluctance to testify. The St. Petersburg Times said that John may have planned the murder as he had visited his parents' property near Tampa a month before the murders. However, as the police established John could not have hired a professional killer, did not have accomplices, and could not have known the timing of his sister-in-law's and nieces' trip, he was dismissed as <b>a</b> <b>suspect.</b>|$|E

5|$|Martin {{was also}} wanted in San Francisco in the United States {{for the murder}} of {{homosexual}} prostitute Tom Wenger on 28 March 1994. Wenger's body was chopped up and drained of blood; it was found in a garbage skip (dumpster) in Myrte Alley in the Polk Street district. Martin's photograph matched a facial composite picture of <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> made by San Francisco police, but he was formally eliminated as <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> after it was established that he was living in a British halfway house {{at the time of the}} murder. He was also investigated for another murder in Arizona.|$|E

40|$|Cognitive {{impairment}} is a prevalent problem {{among the}} homeless and seems related to more psychosocial problems. However, {{little is known about}} the care needs of the subgroup of homeless people with an intellectual disability compared to those without an intellectual disability and how their care needs develop over time. This study explores self-reported care needs within a broad range of life domains among Dutch homeless people with and without <b>a</b> <b>suspected</b> intellectual disability to gain insight into the transition of self-reported care needs from baseline to follow-up in both subgroups. This longitudinal study is part of a cohort study among homeless people who had been accepted for an individual programme plan in four major Dutch cities. The initial cohort consisted of 513 participants who were interviewed in 2011. At 1. 5 -year follow-up, 336 participants (65. 5 %) were also interviewed and screened for intellectual disability. Of these participants, 31 % (95 % CI 26. 2 - 36. 1) had <b>a</b> <b>suspected</b> intellectual disability. For both groups, between baseline and follow-up, the number of 'unmet care needs' decreased significantly and the number of 'no care needs' increased significantly, while at follow-up, participants with <b>a</b> <b>suspected</b> intellectual disability reported 'no care needs' on significantly fewer life domains than those without <b>a</b> <b>suspected</b> intellectual disability (mean numbers 16. 4 vs. 17. 5). Between baseline and follow-up, 'met care needs' decreased significantly on housing for both groups, and increased on finances and dental care for participants with <b>a</b> <b>suspected</b> intellectual disability. At follow-up, participants with <b>a</b> <b>suspected</b> intellectual disability more often preferred housing support available by appointment than those without <b>a</b> <b>suspected</b> intellectual disability. These findings suggest that homeless people who had been accepted for an individual programme plan with <b>a</b> <b>suspected</b> intellectual disability have care needs for a longer period of time than those without <b>a</b> <b>suspected</b> intellectual disability. Providing care to homeless people with <b>a</b> <b>suspected</b> intellectual disability might require ongoing care and support, also after exiting homelessness. Support services should take this into account when considering their care provision and planning of services...|$|R

Condit, a married man who represented the congressional district in which the Levy family resided, at first denied that he had had an affair with her.

5|$|During their investigation, Pembleton and Bayliss learn Kaja {{has been}} in a Haitian prison for four months, {{eliminating}} him as a lead. Gee announces the Baltimore Sun is running a story that Kaja has been cleared as <b>a</b> <b>suspect,</b> leaked from the police. Pembleton accuses Ballard and Gharty of leaking the story, while Gharty accuses Pembleton of going easy on Felix Wilson because he is a successful black man. The discussion prompts a heated argument with accusations of racism from both sides. Pembleton agrees to interview Felix Wilson alone because he believes it will clear him. When Pembleton tells Wilson he needs a blood test from him and his son, Wilson admits that he had consensual sex with Brierre the night of the murder, but said he does not kill her. Later, a devastated Pembleton and Gee still insist he should not necessarily be treated as <b>a</b> <b>suspect,</b> much to the disbelief of Ballard and Gharty. The detectives are interrupted by Wilson's attorney, who says the family will not submit to a blood and hair test without a court order.|$|E

That same year, he sponsored an ordinance that effectively blocked police officers, city inspectors, and other city employees from inquiring about a resident's immigration status. The ordinance forbids police officers from arresting <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> solely {{on the grounds of}} a suspected immigration status violation.|$|E

5|$|In February 1999, David Protess, a Northwestern University journalism professor, and his {{students}} were studying cases of people on death row. They discovered evidence related to Death Row inmate Anthony Porter that might help exonerate him. The students produced four affidavits and a videotaped statement that attributed guilt for the crime to another suspect. They obtained recantations by some witnesses of their testimony at trial. One witness claimed that he named Anthony Porter as <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> only after police officers threatened, harassed and intimidated him into doing so.|$|E

The action was initially successful, but the award of 40,000 Aruban florins (US$22,300) was reversed on appeal. The family's finances were depleted by the legal expenses.

5|$|Shortly after 7:00 am on 30 December 2010, Christopher Jefferies, Yeates' {{landlord}} {{who lived}} in the same building, was arrested on suspicion of her murder. He was taken to a local police station for questioning while forensic investigators inspected his flat. On 31 December, a senior police officer granted investigators a 12-hour extension to the arrest, enabling them to hold him in custody for additional questioning. Police subsequently applied to magistrates for further extensions which were granted on 31 December and 1 January. Investigators were able to detain him as <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> for up to 96 hours, but released Jefferies on bail after two days. He retained the legal services of the law firm Stokoe Partnership to act on his behalf. On 4 March 2011, police released him from bail and stated he was no longer <b>a</b> <b>suspect.</b> He subsequently won an undisclosed sum in libel damages for defamatory news articles published following his arrest, and received an apology from Avon and Somerset Police for any distress caused to him during the investigation.|$|E
