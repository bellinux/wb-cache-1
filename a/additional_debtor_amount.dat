40|$|A {{specific}} {{means of}} extincting a suretyship is constituted by the creditor’ act, {{in this case}} the bank, which allowed the loss of the rights and securities he had against the principal debtor and in which the surety was going to subrogate. The fault of the bank according to the analyzed case-law is that the bankruptcy procedure for the principal debtor was already opened and thus he was too late in lodging claims and did not gain the statute of creditor entitled to participate to the bankruptcy proceedings. The surety’s right of recourse against the principal debtor, through subrogation, in order to obtain from him the repayment of the amounts paid to the bank-creditor comes in conflict with the creditor’s act. Following the non-registration of the bank on the statement of assets and liabilities of the debtor undergoing bankruptcy, the surety is deprived of the possibility to legally subrogate to his rights and securities.

60|$|Such grief may be {{conceived}} {{better than it}} can be described, {{as is well known}} to those who have experienced it. But Mary Avenel had been taught by the peculiarity of her situation, to regard herself as the Child of Destiny; and the melancholy and reflecting turn of her disposition gave to her sorrows a depth and breadth peculiar to her character. The grave--and it was a bloody grave--had closed, as she believed, over the youth to whom she was secretly, but most warmly attached; the force and ardour of Halbert's character bearing a singular correspondence to the energy of which her own was capable. Her sorrow did not exhaust itself in sighs and tears, but when the first shock had passed away, concentrated itself with deep and steady meditation, to collect and calculate, like a bankrupt <b>debtor,</b> the full <b>amount</b> of her loss. It seemed as if all that connected her with earth, had vanished with this broken tie. She had never dared to anticipate the probability of an ultimate union with Halbert, yet now his supposed fall seemed that of the only tree which was to shelter her from the storm. She respected the more gentle character, and more peaceful attainments, of the younger Glendinning; but it had not escaped her (what never indeed escaped woman in such circumstances) that he was disposed to place himself in competition with what she, the daughter of a proud and warlike race, deemed the more manly qualities of his elder brother; and there is no time when a woman does so little justice to the character of a surviving lover, as when comparing him with the preferred rival of whom she has been recently deprived.|$|R
40|$|The {{consumer}} bankruptcy system {{plays an}} enormous albeit largely under appreciated {{role in the}} United States economy. There were nearly 1. 6 million consumer bankruptcy filings in the United States in 2004 - {{more than twice the}} number just ten years earlier, and more than one filing for every 70 households in the country. Nearly a third of these filings were under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. (Chapter 13 provides for individual debt readjustment pursuant to a repayment plan, whereas Chapter 7 provides for liquidation of assets to pay creditor claims.) Yet, little is known about what debtors and creditors accomplish in Chapter 13 cases or how well the Chapter 13 system serves its intended purposes. This article reports on the findings of the Chapter 13 Project, a national empirical study of 795 Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings in seven federal judicial districts. Funded by the National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges and the American Bankruptcy Institute, it is the first and only national study of its kind. It provides a detailed portrait of the Chapter 13 system {{and the extent to which}} Chapter 13 has fulfilled its principal purposes [...] debtor fresh start, on the one hand, and creditor repayment, on the other. The article first reports on who is using Chapter 13 - the gender, income, indebtedness and other bankruptcy filings of the debtors in the sample. It then reports on the extent to which the debtors in the seven districts completed their plans and obtained a discharge. Next, we consider various debtor characteristics - gender, income, amount and type of debt, debt-income ratio, other filings - and certain plan features - length, proposed distribution to unsecured creditors, income reserved for payment of living expenses - for their relation to case outcome. Regarding creditor repayment, the study reports in detail on the amounts and types of debt that are collected by creditors in Chapter 13 cases. The Project has produced a wealth of new information and insights into the Chapter 13 system. Some of the highlights include: Most of the debtors in the sample were far less affluent than the population as a whole. At least 50 % of the debtors had filed one or more other petitions. Discharge rates varied significantly by district, but overall only one-third of the debtors completed a plan. We found statistically significant correlations between case outcome and <b>debtor</b> income, <b>amount</b> and type of debt, and other filings. Equally revealing, the study found no significant relationship between case outcome and plan feasibility, proposed plan length or proposed distribution to unsecured creditors. Regarding creditor repayment, the study reports that the primary creditor beneficiaries by far of the Chapter 13 system are secured creditors; and that less than a third of trustee disbursements were to general unsecured creditors. The median amount paid to unsecured creditors in all cases was $ 0...|$|R
40|$|Under {{both the}} prior and current laws, a {{creditor}} seeking {{to satisfy a}} judgment out of property of the judgment debtor obtains a writ of execution from the {{clerk of the court}} that issued the judgment and then delivers the writ to a sheriff in one of Florida 2 ̆ 7 s sixty-seven counties. The writ commands the sheriff to levy on property of the <b>debtor</b> until the <b>amount</b> stated in the writ is satisfied. Under the prior law, delivery of the writ to the sheriff not only initiated the execution process, but under the seminal case of Love v. Williams, it also created an inchoate lien on all personal property subject to execution in that county. The sheriff was required to keep a record of the delivery of such writs in an execution docket. If the judgment debt was not satisfied out of the proceeds of the initial levy, or if there were no levy, the sheriff would keep the writ and the inchoate lien would continue, attaching to any new personal property the debtor might bring into the county. The effect of the inchoate lien was that if anyone were to cause the sheriff to levy on personalty of the debtor, the inchoate lien would ripen into a true lien which would date from the original moment of delivery to the sheriff. Having levied, the sheriff would sell under the writ first delivered. The proceeds of the execution sale were then distributed in the order in which the existing writs had been delivered to the sheriff. As I have discussed elsewhere, there were two significant problems with this process. The foremost criticism was that the inchoate lien operated as a secret lien. Most people buying or lending against property did not know of or bother to check the sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s docket to see if the property might be subject to an inchoate execution lien. If so, and if the sheriff were later to levy on the property, they would lose it. This result flies squarely {{in the face of the}} fundamental policy in debtor-creditor law of protecting good faith transferees from unfair surprise. The second major criticism of the process was that it had the occasional effect of insulating debtors from the collection efforts of diligent creditors. Imagine a would-be diligent judgment creditor who found nonexempt property of the debtor and took steps to levy on it, only to check the docket and discover a number of prior inchoate lienors passively waiting for someone else to come along and levy on the property of the debtor. If the buildup of prior writs was substantial enough, the judgment creditor 2 ̆ 7 s only reasonable response would be to give up. The debtor then would continue to enjoy assets that could have been applied to payment of the debt, insulated from the efforts of the diligent judgment creditor by the buildup of prior inchoate liens. The new lien law has a number of salutary features, but the primary motivation to enact it was the desire to eliminate these problems. My purpose here is to describe and provide examples as to how the new law is intended to work, how it intersects with other law, how portions of the law came into being, what problems concerned us, and how we sought to remedy those concerns. I also point out areas in which the statute is flawed or inadequate and suggest how, consistent with the goals of the statute, those problems might be approached...|$|R
