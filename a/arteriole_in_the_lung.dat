40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine whether}} lung endothelial cells (ECs) from {{patients}} with systemic sclerosis (SSc) -associated {{interstitial lung disease}} (ILD) express mesenchymal cell-specific proteins and gene transcripts, indicative of the occurrence of endothelial-to-mesenchymal phenotypic transition (EndoMT). METHODS: Lung tissue from 6 patients with SSc-associated pulmonary fibrosis was examined by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Confocal laser microscopy was utilized to assess the simultaneous expression of EC and myofibroblast molecular markers. CD 31 +CD 102 + ECs were isolated from <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> tissue of 2 patients with SSc-associated ILD and 2 normal control subjects, and the expression of EC and mesenchymal cell markers and other relevant genes was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence microscopy, and Western blotting. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining revealed cells expressing the EC-specific marker CD 31 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subendothelial, perivascular, and parenchymal regions of <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> from all SSc patients. Confocal microscopy identified cells displaying simultaneous expression of von Willebrand factor and α-smooth muscle actin in small and medium-sized <b>arterioles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SSc <b>lung</b> tissue but not in normal control lungs. CD 31 +CD 102 + ECs isolated from SSc lungs expressed high levels of mesenchymal cell-specific genes (type I collagen, type III collagen, and fibronectin), EC-specific genes (type IV collagen and VE-cadherin), profibrotic genes (transforming growth factor β 1 and connective tissue growth factor), and genes encoding EndoMT-related transcription factors (TWIST 1 and SNAI 2). CONCLUSION: Cells coexpressing EC- and mesenchymal cell-specific molecules are present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> of patients with SSc-associated ILD. CD 31 +CD 102 + ECs isolated from SSc lungs simultaneously expressed mesenchymal cell- and EC-specific transcripts and proteins.

This study evaluated whether these vessel constrictions detected ophthalmoscopically have an equivalent in angiographic imaging of the fundus.  METHODS—Fluorescein angiograms and colour wide angle fundus photographs of 33  patients with open angle glaucoma and 76  subjects with normal optic nerves were examined for focal narrowing of retinal arterioles. The angiograms had primarily been taken for other reasons such as age related macula degeneration.  RESULTS—All focal narrowings of retinal arterioles detected on fundus photographs showed a localised constriction of vessel filling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fluorescein angiograms. Degree of vessel narrowing on the fundus photographs and degree of constriction of the fluorescein vessel filling were significantly (p< 0. 001) correlated with each other.  CONCLUSIONS—Focal narrowing of retinal <b>arterioles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parapapillary region of eyes with optic neuropathies represents a real stenosis of the vessel lumen and is not due to an ophthalmoscopic artefact.    Keywords: fluorescein angiography; focal vessel constriction; glaucoma; optic dis...|$|R

Based on the {{experiment}} of the microarteriogenesis that {{is associated with}} angiogenesis during tissue repair process in porous silk fibroin films (PSFFs), we investigate the characteristics of micro-arteriogenesis and explore its mechanism. Methods. After the porous silk fibroin materials are implanted into the back hypodermal tissue of SD rats, the arteriole development and the morphogenesis of smooth muscle cell are histologically monitored and the micro-arteriogenesis is quantitatively analyzed. Results. 10 days after implantation, the arteriole density reaches <b>the</b> highest level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> junction of silk fibroin materials with tissues.

However, 18 - to 21 -week-old SHR had 30 % to 35 % fewer <b>arterioles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> diameter range of 25 - 3 * 5 /A, as if intestinal vessels were lost or failed to grow during maturation. The largest and smallest <b>arterioles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intestine of adult SHR were constricted by 20 % to 25 %, but other vessels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SHR had an equal or increased diameter relative to those in WKY rats. As a result of rarefaction and selective vasoconstriction in SHR, microvascular pressures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intestinal muscle of SHR were near those in WKY rats, and those in villi of SHR were equal to those in WKY rats despite a 60 % to 70 % increase in mean arterial pressure <b>in</b> SHR. <b>The</b> percentage of small arterioles (< 15 /x) that were intermittently closed to flow at rest was minimal, and the total number of small vessels per milligram of tissue was equal in WKY and SH rats.

The authors have been developed a high-resolution PIV technique, which can improve the dynamic range, spatial resolution and measurement accuracy. <b>In</b> this paper, <b>the</b> proposed method is applied to visualized images of <b>the</b> <b>arteriole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rat mesentery using the intravital-microscope and the high-speed digital video system.

40|$|Human {{systemic}} {{lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) patients, as well as MRLlpr/lpr mice which develop a SLE-like disease, have decreased numbers and functional activity of systemic natural killer (NK) cells. In contrast, {{it has been found}} that among lymphocytes recovered from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of SLE patients, NK cells were increased in number, correlating with the severity of <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> engagement. <b>The</b> present study was undertaken to assay the capacity for natural killing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> compartment of MRLlpr/lpr mice compared with healthy congenic MRL +/+ and heterozygous MRL +/lpr mice. 51 Cr-labelled YAC- 1 cells were injected intravenously to settle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> where they were targeted for lysis by NK cells. YAC- 1 cell killing inversely correlated with radioactivity remaining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> after <b>the</b> assay, and was inhibited by antibody to the asialo-GM 1 antigen expressed on NK cells. To analyse <b>the</b> capacity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> for cytolysis of non-NK cell-sensitive target cells, a similar in vivo 51 Cr-release assay was set up for antibody-mediated allospecific cytotoxicity. We demonstrate that MRLlpr/lpr mice throughout their lifespan display significantly increased natural cytotoxic activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> compared with MRL +/+ and MRL +/lpr mice, as demonstrated by more efficient killing of YAC- 1 cells. In contrast, antibody-mediated allospecific cytotoxicity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> was significantly less effective <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MRLlpr/lpr strain...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} glycyrrhizic acid (GLA) to reduce the tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), release on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein production <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> using GLA <b>in</b> response to irradiation were studied. The animals were divided into four groups: No treatment (NT group), GLA treatment only (GLA group), irradiation only (XRT group), and GLA treatment plus irradiation (GLA/XRT group). Rats were killed at different time points. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to {{evaluate the}} mRNA expression of TNF-α <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> (compared with non-irradiated lungs). An enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) assay was used to measure the TNF-α protein level. The TNF-α mRNA expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> of <b>the</b> XRT rats was clearly higher at all-time points compared to the NT rats. The TNF-α mRNA expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> of <b>the</b> GLA/XRT rats was lower at all-time points compared to the XRT rats. Release of the TNF-α on protein level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> of <b>the</b> XRT rats increased at all-time points compared to <b>the</b> NT rats. <b>In</b> contrast to <b>the</b> XRT rats, <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> of <b>the</b> GLA/XRT rats revealed a reduction on TNF-α protein level at 6 h after irradiation. This study has clearly showed the immediate down-regulation of the TNF-α mRNA and protein production <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> using GLA <b>in</b> response to irradiation...|$|R
40|$|Background Asthmatic {{inflammation}} {{is mediated}} by {{a network of}} cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules. Corticosteroids are the only effective agents available to control asthmatic inflammation. We investigated the effect of high-dose montelukast (MK), a selective cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 antagonist, on mediators of airway inflammation. Objective The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of a 3 -day course of high-dose MK on mediators of airway inflammation induced by a single allergen challenge in sensitized mice. Methods Ovalbumin (OVA) -sensitized BALB/c mice were treated with 25 mg/kg of MK or saline intravenously for 3 days. On the third day, a single inhalation challenge with OVA was given. Cellular infiltration was assessed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b> Expression of IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 13 and eotaxin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> BAL, and <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> was determined. Serum IL- 5 and total IgE was measured. IL- 5 and eotaxin mRNA expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> was determined. Finally, eotaxin and VACM- 1 expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results MK reduced the number of eosinophils <b>in</b> <b>the</b> BAL by > 90 %. There was also significant reduction in IL- 5 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> BAL, <b>lung</b> and <b>the</b> serum, and IL- 5 mRNA expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b> IL- 4 level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> and BAL, and IL- 13 level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> also significantly decreased. Serum IgE level and lung VCAM- 1 expression was also significantly lower in treated animals, but eotaxin protein and mRNA expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> remained unchanged. Conclusion MK exerts its anti-inflammatory effect through the suppression of T helper type- 2 (Th 2) cytokines. The use of high-dose MK as an anti-inflammatory agent in acute asthma should be further explored...|$|R
