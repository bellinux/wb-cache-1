5|$|The {{center of}} {{diversity}} of the genus Malus is in eastern present-day Turkey. The <b>apple</b> <b>tree</b> was perhaps the earliest tree to be cultivated, and its fruits have been improved through selection over thousands of years. Alexander the Great is credited with finding dwarfed apples in Kazakhstan in 328 BCE. Winter apples, picked in late autumn and stored just above freezing, have been an important food in Asia and Europe for millennia.|$|E
5|$|The <b>apple</b> <b>tree</b> (Malus pumila, {{commonly}} and erroneously called Malus domestica) is a deciduous tree in {{the rose}} family {{best known for its}} sweet, pomaceous fruit, the apple. It is cultivated worldwide as a fruit tree, and is the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions.|$|E

5|$|The {{house of}} one of the farmworkers was at the crash site. He first ran to his house, where he found that his wife had survived and was safe. Richards rescued one man from the {{wreckage}} and put him by an <b>apple</b> <b>tree.</b> Another survivor was on fire. In a contemporary inverview one of the rescuers says the survivor came running across the farmyard. 60 years later Richards said he rescued the survivor from the aircraft. Accounts agree that rescuers put the survivor in a horse trough to extinguish the flames and cool his burns.|$|E
5|$|I {{saw them}} as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be perfect for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression {{that would be used}} against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to those who want to be friendly. But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an <b>apple</b> <b>tree</b> branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E
5|$|Once the badnjak has burnt through, the thicker end {{is often}} {{taken out of}} the fire and used {{according}} to the local custom. It may be carried around the beehives, extinguished, and placed between the branches of a young plum or <b>apple</b> <b>tree.</b> The men may make crosses from it and put them under the eaves, on the fields, meadows, vineyards, and apiaries, so that the coming year may be happy and fruitful. It may also be set aside for next Christmas Eve, to be placed on the fire immediately before the new badnjak, as a symbol of continuity. In Kosovo, a part of the badnjak is preserved and burned again on New Years Day and Epiphany.|$|E

5|$|There {{are more}} than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Cultivars vary in their yield and the {{ultimate}} size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock. Different cultivars are available for temperate and subtropical climates. The UK's National Fruit Collection, which {{is the responsibility of}} the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs, includes a collection of over 2,000 cultivars of <b>apple</b> <b>tree</b> in Kent. The University of Reading, which is responsible for developing the UK national collection database, provides access to search the national collection.

5|$|On the upper-left side of what {{is today}} {{considered}} {{the back of the}} vessel, the mask of young Pan {{can be seen in the}} tree. Below, a goat is reaching for ripened grapes. Behind the goat lies fruit and a table, most likely an anclabris with five ceremonial vessels on top. On the left side of the table stands a small female figure, whose lit torches represent the festivities and the orgies associated with the cult's rites. Frédéric de Clarac argued that the statues could very well symbolize either Telete or Ceres, two deities often associated with Dionysus. Above the table is a tapestry and two bacchante masks. To the right, in an <b>apple</b> <b>tree,</b> another mask of Pan can be seen. Two more bacchante masks are present on the bottom, in front of the table.|$|E

40|$|Effect {{of autumn}} urea {{application}} on cold hardiness of <b>apple</b> <b>trees</b> was investigated at Experimental Orchard in Dąbrowice on four apple cultivars ('Szampioii'. ´Jonagold´, ´Elstar' and 'Spartan´) of different sensitivity to low temperature injuries. During three-years experiment (2000 - 2002) no changes in frost resistance of <b>apple</b> <b>trees</b> after urea {{treatment in the}} end of October (during leaves fall) were noted. After the earlier application of urea, at middle of October. significantly more damages of annual shoots of cv. ´Jonagold' occurred only in the season 2001. These damages did not influence later growth of <b>apple</b> <b>trees.</b> Spring observations indicated that for all apple's cultivars setting of buds was better on treated with urea than on untreated ones. Electrolyte leakage determinations confirmed the field results that urea did not cause decrease in low temperature resistance of <b>apple</b> <b>trees...</b>|$|R
