The art of cooking the must of grapes dates back to the ancient Romans: it was used both as a medicine and in the kitchen as a sweetener and condiment.The first generally accepted document referring to a precious vinegar produced in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia is the poem written in the 12th century by the monk Donizo of Canossa, although the word [...] "balsamic" [...] is never mentioned.

40|$|Highly {{reflective}} roofs can {{decrease the}} energy required for building air conditioning, help mitigate the urban heat island effect, and slow global warming. However, these benefits are diminished by soiling and weathering processes that reduce the solar reflectance of most roofing materials. Soiling {{results from the}} deposition of atmospheric particulate matter {{and the growth of}} microorganisms, each of which absorb sunlight. Weathering of materials occurs with exposure to water, sunlight, and high temperatures. This study developed an accelerated <b>aging</b> <b>method</b> that incorporates features of soiling and weathering. The method sprays a calibrated aqueous soiling mixture of dust minerals, black carbon, humic acid, and salts onto preconditioned coupons of roofing materials, then subjects the soiled coupons to cycles of ultraviolet radiation, heat and water in a commercial weatherometer. Three soiling mixtures were optimized to reproduce the site-specific solar spectralreflectance features of roofing products exposed for 3 years in a hot and humid climate (Miami, Florida); a hot and dry climate (Phoenix, Arizona); and a polluted atmosphere in a temperate climate (Cleveland, Ohio). A fourth mixture was designed to reproduce the three-site average values of solar reflectance and thermal emittance attained after 3 years of natural exposure, which the Cool Roof Rating Council (CRRC) uses to rate roofing products sold in the US. This accelerated <b>aging</b> <b>method</b> was applied to 25 products?single ply membranes, factory and field applied coatings, tiles, modified bitumen cap sheets, and asphalt shingles?and reproduced in 3 days the CRRC's 3 -year aged values of solar reflectance.

These amendments may increase the accuracy and precision of sablefish age estimates.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Anthropology. Age-at-death estimation of an individual skeleton is important to forensic and biological anthropologists for identification and demographic analysis, but {{it has been shown that}} current <b>aging</b> <b>methods</b> are often unreliable because of skeletal variation and taphonomic factors. Due to this, it seems necessary to explore different ways to account for this inherent inaccuracy in the <b>aging</b> <b>methods</b> to produce better results when determining age-at-death. Multifactorial methods have been shown to produce better results when determining age-at-death than single indicator methods. However, multifactoral methods are difficult to use for single skeletons and they rarely provide the investigator with information about the reliability of the estimate. The goal of this research is to examine the validity of the Sugeno fuzzy integral for modeling age-at-death of an individual skeleton. The Sugeno fuzzy integral is an information fusion technique that can handle uncertainty that is inherent in the <b>aging</b> <b>methods.</b> Since the <b>age</b> determination <b>methods</b> are not intended to be a rigid set of typological standards but rather describe modal age changes, uncertainty is inherent in skeletal age determination. The Sugeno fuzzy integral allows the use of as many age indicators available, the condition of the skeleton, and the accuracy of the skeletal age indicators to produce a more informed decision of age-at-death in an adult skeleton. This method is described and examples are presented using three commonly used <b>aging</b> <b>methods</b> on a known-age skeletal sample from the Terry Collection. The Sugeno integral uses multiple sources and types of information, does not require the use of a population, and produces graphical results...|$|R
40|$|This study evaluates {{effects of}} aging on repair bond {{strengths}} of microhybrid, nanohybrid, and nanofilled composite resins and characterizes the interacting surfaces after aging. Disk-shaped composite specimens {{were assigned to}} one of three aging conditions: (1) thermocycling (5, 000 ×, 5 – 55 °C), (2) storage in water at 37 °C for 6  months, or (3) immersion in citric acid at 37 °C, pH  3 for 1  week; a non-aged group acted as the control. Two surface conditionings were selected: intermediate adhesive resin application (IAR-application) and chairside silica coating followed by silanization and its specific IAR-application (SC-application). Composite resins, of the same kind as their substrate, were adhered onto the substrates, and repair shear bond strengths were determined, followed by failure type evaluation. Filler particle exposure was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and surface roughness analyzed using scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. Surface roughness increased in all composite resins after aging, but filler particle exposure at the surface only increased after thermocycling and citric acid immersion.
