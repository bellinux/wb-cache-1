The onboard charger in all 2013 Leafs has also been reduced in size and relocated to a new position under the hood, which increases cargo volume. The new base trim level is called the Leaf S model, and {{is the result of a}} strategy for affordability. The S trim replaces the LED headlights with less expensive projector beams, and uses 16-inch steel wheels with plastic covers rather than alloy wheels. The base trim does not include the navigation system and the remote connectivity that allows drivers to turn on the climate control and monitor battery charging remotely using a smartphone. LED headlamps, fog lights, 17-inch alloy wheels and leather seating, are reserved for the higher-end SL trim. Additional premium upgrades to the SL trim include a Bose seven-speaker audio system and <b>around</b> <b>view</b> <b>monitor,</b> which puts cameras in front, in back and on the side mirrors for parking assistance.|$|E

40|$|Recently, a car employs various {{built-in}} sensors {{such as a}} speedometer, odometer, accelerometer and {{angular rate}} sensor for safety and maintenance. These sensory data can be provided in real time through a CAN (Controller Area Network) bus. In addition, image sequences can be provided from various cameras mounted to the car, such as built-in front and <b>around</b> <b>view</b> <b>monitoring</b> cameras. We thus propose an image based car navigation framework to determine car position and attitude using the built-in sensory data such as a speed, angular rate and images from a front view camera. First, we determine the two-dimensional position and attitude of a car using the velocity and angular rate provided in real-time through the CAN bus. We then estimate the three-dimensional position and attitude by conducting sequential bundle block adjustment using the two-dimensional position and attitude and tie points between image sequences. The sequential bundle adjustment can produce accurate results comparable to those from the conventional simultaneous bundle adjustment in real time. As the input to this process, it needs reliable tie points between adjacent images acquired from a real-time image matching process. Hence, we develop an image matching process based on the enhanced KLT algorithm using preliminary exterior orientation parameters. We also construct a test system that can acquire and store built-in sensory data and front camera images at the same time, and conduct experiments with the real data acquired by the system. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed image matching process can generate accurate tie-points with about 0. 2 second in average at each epoch. It can successfully meet the requirements from real-time bundle adjustment for image based car navigation. 1...|$|R
