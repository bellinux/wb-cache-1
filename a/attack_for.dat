5|$|Although Bellone would {{normally}} be much faster than the large British warship, the light winds and Rattlesnakes determined pursuit prevented the privateer from escaping and at 17:00, Powerful {{was close enough to}} open fire. Despite the uneven nature of the combat, Bellone unexpectedly resisted the British <b>attack</b> <b>for</b> another hour and 45 minutes, causing more damage to Powerful than she received herself. The privateer was later taken into British service as a sixth rate frigate and prize money was paid for the captured vessels, but the action prompted questions in subsequent histories about the lack of efficiency in British gunnery.|$|E

Although the Red Army desperately attempted to fend off advancing Wehrmacht and launched local counterattacks to relieve several surrounded units, they generally failed. By the end of May 24, Soviet forces opposite Kharkov had been surrounded by German formations, which had been able to transfer several more divisions to the front, increasing the pressure on the Soviet flanks and finally forcing them to collapse.|$|E
5|$|An hour later, having {{endured the}} fire of the guns on both shores, Aigle was in a {{position}} to attack the rear-most frigate of the pair as they emerged from the western side of the island. This frigate sought the shelter of Groix' batteries, so Aigle set off in pursuit of the other which was now making for Lorient. As it was now dark, Aigle displayed a blue light to indicate her position to the closing Impétueux, and at 21:00, coming within 50 yards, exchanged fire with the Frenchman. To prevent a boarding, which Wolfe was determined upon, the frigate came about and, shortly after the British had broken off their <b>attack</b> <b>for</b> lack of sea room, ran aground on the Pointe de Chats on the eastern edge of Groix.|$|E
5|$|As the Seven Years' War entered its {{later stages}} through 1758 and 1759, French forces and colonies in northeastern North America came under renewed attacks from British armies. In 1758 after defeat in July at the Battle of Carillon, the British took Louisbourg in August, causing Atlantic Canada {{to fall into}} British hands, and opening the sea route to attack Quebec. Fort Frontenac fell to the British in the same month, costing the French {{supplies}} for the Ohio Valley campaign. When some of the Indian supporters of the French made peace with the British, France was forced to draw its troops back. French leadership, specifically Governor de Vaudreuil and General Montcalm, were unsettled by the British successes. However, Quebec {{was still able to}} protect itself as the British prepared a three-pronged <b>attack</b> <b>for</b> 1759.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. HAVAL is a {{cryptographic}} hash function with variable digest size proposed by Zheng, Pieprzyk and Seberry in 1992. It has three variants, 3 -, 4 -, and 5 -pass HAVAL. Previous results on HAVAL suggested only practical collision <b>attacks</b> <b>for</b> 3 -pass HAVAL. In this paper, we present collision <b>attacks</b> <b>for</b> 4 and 5 pass HAVAL. For 4 -pass HAVAL, we describe two practical <b>attacks</b> <b>for</b> finding 2 -block collisions, one with 2 43 computations {{and the other}} with 2 36 computations. In addition, we show that collisions for 5 -pass HAVAL can be found with about 2 123 computations, which is the first attack more efficient than the birthday attack...|$|R

5|$|British Lt. Col. Robert Abercromby {{decided to}} push his {{advantage}} after scattering Irvine's troops. He pushed north and captured St. Thomas Episcopal Church, located on a hillock. Howe arrived a short while later, and ascended {{to the top of}} the church's bell tower in an attempt to view the American positions. Deciding the American defenses were too strong to attack with his present force, he opted to shell their defenses with artillery fire; however, his guns did not have the range to hit Washington's defenses. His forces camped on Chestnut Hill that night, and planned a new way of <b>attack</b> <b>for</b> the following day.|$|E
5|$|Five KPA {{divisions}} amassed {{to oppose}} the UN at Taegu. From south to north, the 10th, 3rd, 15th, 13th, and 1st Divisions occupied a wide line encircling Taegu from Tuksong-dong and around Waegwan to Kunwi. The KPA planned to use the natural corridor of the Naktong valley from Sangju to Taegu as its main axis of <b>attack</b> <b>for</b> the next push south, so the divisions all eventually moved through this valley, crossing the Naktong at different areas along the low ground. Elements of the DPRK 105th Armored Division also supported the attack.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Vimy Ridge was a {{military}} engagement fought primarily {{as part of the}} Battle of Arras, in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France, during the First World War. The main combatants were the Canadian Corps, of four divisions, against three divisions of the German Sixth Army. The battle, which took place from 9 to 12 April 1917, was part of the opening phase of the British-led Battle of Arras, a diversionary <b>attack</b> <b>for</b> the French Nivelle Offensive.|$|E
5|$|Things {{changed in}} the early 1960s when McNamara placed limits on the Air Force fleet of 1,000 Minuteman {{missiles}} and 54 Titan IIs. This meant that the Air Force could not respond to new Soviet missiles simply by building more of their own. An even greater existential threat to Minuteman than Soviet missiles was the US Navy's Polaris missile fleet, whose invulnerability led to questions {{about the need for}} any ground-based ICBM. The Air Force responded by changing missions; the increasingly accurate Minuteman was now tasked with attacking Soviet missile silos, which the less accurate Navy missiles could not do. If the force was going to carry out this mission there had to be the expectation that enough missiles could survive a Soviet <b>attack</b> <b>for</b> a successful counterstrike. An ABM might provide that assurance.|$|E
