25|$|When escape seemed unlikely, Seringapatam changed {{course and}} {{appeared}} to be making an <b>attack</b> <b>run</b> on Greenwich but the latter came to a halt and waited for Georgiana to come up and provide assistance. At this point, four men were transferred from Georgiana to Greenwich so Captain Stavers chose to break off the attack and continue fleeing. Lieutenant Gamble closed the distance between the two ships and he first demanded that the British surrender. But when the Americans came within pistol range, Seringapatam raised her colors and fired a powerful broadside.|$|E
25|$|Following a {{dry dock}} period at San Francisco Naval Shipyard over the winter, where the {{aircraft}} carrier was modified to support A-7 Corsair II aircraft, Oriskany embarked CVW-19 that spring for refresher operations. In contrast to previous deployments, she carried only four combat squadrons – VF-191 and VF-194 equipped with the familiar F8 Crusaders and VA-153 and VA-155 equipped with A-7. Commencing her fifth Vietnam deployment on 14 May 1970, Oriskany inchopped on 1 June and began combat operations at Yankee Station on 14 June. Like her last deployment, Oriskany launched strikes against North Vietnamese logistics targets in eastern Laos, initially targeting storage areas, bunkers and lines of communication in conjunction with strikes by the Seventh Air Force. Equipped with better electronics gear, the A-7 proved especially useful during night raids on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The missions remained dangerous, however, with an A-7 from VA-155 lost in a failed catapult shot on 25 June and a VA-153 A-7 crashing in Laos on 28 June. In the latter case, the aircraft – flown by Cdr. Donald D. Aldern, then Commander, Air Wing Nineteen — exploded during a night <b>attack</b> <b>run,</b> presumably after taking flak damage. Oriskany conducted three line periods—14–29 June, 13–21 July, 3–25 August and 18 September to 13 October – and launched over 5,300 sorties. During the latter line period, Captain Frank S. Haak relieved Captain Gillcrist on 11 September 1970, and became the new commanding officer.|$|E

25|$|During {{the evening}} of 16–17 June, the three destroyers were ordered to {{undertake}} surveillance missions around Tiger Island, because of reports of North Vietnamese helicopter activity in the area. At 03:09, Hobarts radar picked up an aircraft approaching with no IFF transponder active. At 03:14, the aircraft fired a single missile at the ship, which killed one sailor, wounded two others, and damaged the chief petty officer's mess, air search radar and missile control compartments, and the ship's funnels. Two minutes later, the aircraft made a second pass and fired two missiles. The missiles hit simultaneously: one penetrated the superstructure and damaged the gunners' store, engineers workshop, and aft seamans' mess, while the other hit close to the original missile, causing further damage to the mess and missile control room, while also damaging the Tartar checkout room, killing another sailor, and wounded six others. These was also major damage around the destroyer's Ikara magazine, but as Hobart was not carrying any Ikara missiles at the time, the potential magazine fire did not occur. The aircraft came around for a third <b>attack</b> <b>run,</b> but was scared off when Hobarts forward gun turret, under independent control, fired five rounds at the aircraft. At 03:30, Edson reported coming under fire, and Hobart captain ordered the three destroyers to take up anti-aircraft formation. At 05:15, the three destroyers linked up with the cruiser USS Boston (which {{had been hit by}} a missile from another aircraft) and the escorting destroyer , and continued anti-aircraft manoeuvring. After being relieved, Hobart sailed for Subic Bay, where the damage was inspected by RAN and USN personnel, including three admirals. Debris collected from Hobart and the other ships indicated that the missiles were of United States Air Force (USAF) origin.|$|E
500|$|In reality, {{the ships}} sighted by Tambor were the {{detachment}} of four cruisers and two destroyers Yamamoto had sent to bombard Midway. At 02:55, these ships received Yamamoto's order to retire and changed course to comply. At {{about the same}} time as this change of course, Tambor was sighted and during maneuvers designed to avoid a submarine attack, the heavy cruisers [...] and [...] collided, inflicting serious damage on Mogamis bow. The less severely damaged Mikuma slowed to [...] to keep pace. Only at 04:12 did the sky brighten enough for Murphy to be certain the ships were Japanese, by which time staying surfaced was hazardous and he dived to approach for an attack. The attack was unsuccessful and at around 06:00 he finally reported two westbound s, before diving again and playing no further role in the battle. Limping along on a straight course at 12knots—roughly one-third their top speed—Mogami and Mikuma had been almost perfect targets for a submarine attack. As soon as Tambor returned to port, Spruance had Murphy relieved of duty and reassigned to a shore station, citing his confusing contact report, poor torpedo shooting during his <b>attack</b> <b>run,</b> and general lack of aggression, especially as compared to Nautilus, the oldest of the 12 boats at Midway and the only one which had successfully placed a torpedo on target (albeit a dud).|$|E

A particularly widespread rumour was that the perpetrator was Somalian and had been heard shouting [...] "Allahu Akbar" [...] after decapitating the victims. The police refused to address any rumours, citing confidentiality during the preliminary investigation. This led to a debate about Swedish journalism ethics and lack of references in news based on race and religion versus the alternative media and their lack of ethics.|$|E
2500|$|The Devastator {{proved to}} be a death trap for its crews: slow and hardly maneuverable, with poor armor for the era; its speed on a glide-bombing {{approach}} was a mere , making it easy prey for fighters and defensive guns alike. The aerial torpedo could not even be released at speeds above [...] Torpedo delivery requires a long, straight-line <b>attack</b> <b>run,</b> making the aircraft vulnerable, and the slow speed of the aircraft made them easy targets for the Mitsubishi A6M Zeros. Only four TBDs made it back to Enterprise, none to Hornet and two to Yorktown, without scoring a torpedo hit.|$|E
2500|$|According to the U.S. government, Vincennes mistakenly {{identified}} the Iranian airliner as an attacking military fighter. The officers mis{{identified the}} flight profile being flown by the Airbus A300B2 as being {{similar to that}} of an F-14A Tomcat during an attack run; however, the ship's own Aegis Combat System recorded the flight plan of the Iranian airliner as climbing (not descending as in an <b>attack</b> <b>run)</b> {{at the time of the}} incident. The commercial flight had originated at Bandar Abbas, which served dual roles as a base for Iranian F-14 operations and as a hub for commercial, civilian flights. According to the same reports, Vincennes tried unsuccessfully to contact the approaching aircraft, seven times on the military emergency frequency and three times on the civilian emergency frequency, but never on air traffic control frequencies. This civilian aircraft was not equipped to pick up military frequencies and the messages on the civilian emergency channel could have been directed at any aircraft. [...] More confusion arose as the hailed speed was the ground speed, while the pilot's instruments displayed airspeed, a [...] difference.|$|E

50|$|During his highly {{successful}} spell {{as the head}} coach of Barcelona, Pep Guardiola was able to incorporate several skillful players with playmaker qualities into his team, such as Xavi, Andrés Iniesta, Cesc Fàbregas and Lionel Messi, {{through the use of}} his personal variation on tiki-taka tactics, allowing the team to move the ball around, switch positions, creating <b>attacking</b> <b>runs</b> and retain possession. His use of heavy pressing in his 4-3-3 formation gave each player defensive responsibilities when possession was lost. Guardiola also frequently deployed Messi in the false-9 role, which has particularly effective due to the frequency of <b>attacking</b> <b>runs</b> made by the Barcelona players, as well as their disciplined positioning, team-work, vision, technical and passing ability, which allowed Messi to create and score several goals.|$|R
