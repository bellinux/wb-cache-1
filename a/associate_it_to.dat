Finally we illustrate the new capability enabled in Cassandra and evaluate the response time to client spatial queries using different schemes: sequential, asynchronous and with and without queries aggregation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Antisocial {{personality}} disorder (ASPD) is a pervasive condition among youngsters around the globe, which has particular pungency {{in countries where}} the socioeconomic context favors delinquency. Several behavioral genetics studies have linked the disorder {{to the presence of}} copies of a polymorphic variation of the MAO-A gene that leads to enzymatic hypofunction. An emerging tendency in this literature is to also <b>associate</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the presence of short variations of the 5 -HTTLPR polymorphism, which is well-known for its possible role in the vulnerability to major depression of individuals that were exposed to early-life stress.

The number of cycles at failure and the crack angles were correlated with two theoretical critical plane models.

In order to organise the knowledge repository we need an interoperability classification framework associated to it. In this paper we propose a generic architecture for a method chunk repository, elaborate on a classification framework and <b>associate</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> some existing bodies of knowledge.
