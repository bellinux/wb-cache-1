5|$|<b>A</b> <b>musical</b> <b>{{instrument}}</b> is {{an instrument}} created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound {{can be considered}} a musical instrument—it is through purpose that the object becomes <b>a</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument.</b> The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E

5|$|The {{date and}} {{origin of the}} first device {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> is disputed. The oldest object that some scholars refer to as <b>a</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument,</b> a simple flute, dates {{back as far as}} 67,000 years. Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago. However, most historians believe that determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible due to the subjectivity of the definition and the relative instability of materials used to make them. Many early musical instruments were made from animal skins, bone, wood, and other non-durable materials.|$|E

5|$|Andre Schaeffner, {{a curator}} at the Musée de l'Homme, {{disagreed}} with the Hornbostel-Sachs system and developed his own system in 1932. Schaeffner believed that the pure physics of <b>a</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument,</b> rather than its specific construction or playing method, should always determine its classification. (Hornbostel-Sachs, for example, divide aerophones {{on the basis of}} sound production, but membranophones {{on the basis of the}} shape of the instrument). His system divided instruments into two categories: instruments with solid, vibrating bodies and instruments containing vibrating air.|$|E

5|$|The {{pipe organ}} is <b>a</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> that {{produces}} sound by driving pressurized air (called wind) through organ pipes selected via a keyboard. Because each pipe produces a single pitch, the pipes {{are provided in}} sets called ranks, {{each of which has}} a common timbre and volume throughout the keyboard compass. Most organs have multiple ranks of pipes of differing timbre, pitch, and volume that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use of controls called stops.|$|E
5|$|The post-Chalukya {{period is}} characterised by the {{popularity}} of Shaiva and Vaishnava devotional writings, though secular and courtly topics written in native metres continued to flourish. Native metres in vogue were the shatpadi (six-line verse), the tripadi, the ragle (rhymed couplets) and the sangatya (compositions meant to be sung to the accompaniment <b>a</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument).</b> Overall, Kannada writings began to change from marga ("formal", due to Sanskritic influence) to desi ("vernacular") and become more accessible to the common man.|$|E

5|$|Bush {{was born}} in Bexleyheath, Kent, (now part of the London Borough of Bexley) to English medical doctor Robert Bush (1920–2008) and Hannah Daly (1918–1992; from County Waterford, Ireland). She was raised as a Roman Catholic in their {{farmhouse}} in East Wickham, an urban village in the neighbouring town of Welling, with her older brothers, John and Paddy. Bush came from an artistic background: her mother was an amateur traditional Irish dancer, her father was an amateur pianist, Paddy worked as <b>a</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> maker, and John was a poet and photographer.

5|$|In July 1995, Slovenian {{archaeologist}} Ivan Turk {{discovered a}} bone carving {{in the northwest}} region of Slovenia. The carving, named the Divje Babe Flute, features four holes that Canadian musicologist Bob Fink determined {{could have been used}} to play four notes of a diatonic scale. Researchers estimate the flute's age at between 43,400 and 67,000 years, making it the oldest known musical instrument and the only musical instrument associated with the Neanderthal culture. However, some archaeologists and ethnomusicologists dispute the flute's status as <b>a</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument.</b> German archaeologists have found mammoth bone and swan bone flutes dating back to 30,000 to 37,000 years old in the Swabian Alps. The flutes were made in the Upper Paleolithic age, and are more commonly accepted as being the oldest known musical instruments.|$|E
5|$|Kannada {{literature}} {{during this}} period consisted of writings relating to the socio-religious developments of the Veerashaiva and Vaishnava faiths, {{and to a lesser}} extent to that of Jainism. Writing on secular topics was popular throughout this period. Authorship of these writings was not limited to poets and scholars alone. Significant literary contributions were made by members of the royal family, their ministers, army commanders of rank, nobility and the various subordinate rulers. In addition, a vast body of devotional folk literature was written by musical bards, mystics and saint-poets, influencing society in the empire. Writers of this period popularised use of the native metres: shatpadi (six-line verse), sangatya (compositions meant to be sung to the accompaniment of <b>a</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument),</b> and tripadi (three-line verse).|$|E

5|$|Matsya Purana tells a {{different}} story of Chamunda's origins. She with other matrikas was created by Shiva to help him kill the demon Andhakasura, who has an ability - like Raktabija - to generate from his dripping blood. Chamunda with the other matrikas drinks {{the blood of the}} demon ultimately helping Shiva kill him. Ratnakara, in his text Haravijaya, also describes this feat of Chamunda, but solely credits Chamunda, not the other matrikas of sipping the blood of Andhaka. Having drunk the blood, Chamunda's complexion changed to blood-red. The text further says that Chamunda does a dance of destruction, playing <b>a</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> whose shaft is Mount Meru, the spring is the cosmic snake Shesha and gourd is the crescent moon. She plays the instrument during the deluge that drowns the world.|$|E
5|$|George Frederic Watts {{was born}} in London in 1817, the son of <b>a</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> manufacturer. His two {{brothers}} died in 1823 and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Meanwhile, his father's strict evangelical Christianity led to both a deep knowledge of the Bible and a strong dislike of organised religion. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor {{at the age of}} 10, and six years later was proficient enough as an artist to earn a living as a portrait painter and cricket illustrator. Aged 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. In 1837 Watts was commissioned by Greek shipping magnate Alexander Constantine Ionides to copy a portrait of his father by Samuel Lane; Ionides preferred Watts's version to the original and immediately commissioned two more paintings from him, allowing Watts to devote himself full-time to painting.|$|E
5|$|Govinda Vaidya, {{a native}} of Srirangapatna, wrote Kanthirava Narasaraja Vijaya, a eulogy of his patron King Narasaraja I. Written in sangatya metre (a {{composition}} meant to be rendered {{to the accompaniment of}} <b>a</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument),</b> the book describes the king's court, popular music and the types of musical compositions of the age in twenty-six chapters. King Chikka Devaraja was the earliest composer of the dynasty. To him is ascribed the famous treatise on music called Geetha Gopala. Though inspired by Jayadeva's Sanskrit writing Geetha Govinda, it had an originality of its own and was written in saptapadi metre. Contemporary poets who left their mark on the entire Kannada-speaking region include the brahmin poet Lakshmisa and the itinerant Veerashaiva poet Sarvajna. Female poets also played a role in literary developments, with Cheluvambe (the queen of Krishnaraja Wodeyar I), Helavanakatte Giriyamma, Sri Rangamma (1685) and Sanchi Honnamma (Hadibadeya Dharma, late 17th century) writing notable works.|$|E
5000|$|An {{electric}} <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> is one {{in which}} the use of electric devices determines or affects the sound produced by <b>an</b> <b>instrument.</b> Electric <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> are <b>an</b> example of electric music technology. It is also known as <b>an</b> amplified <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> due to the common utilization of an electronic instrument amplifier to project the intended sound as determined by electric signals from the instrument. Two common types of instrument amplifiers are the guitar amplifier and the bass amplifier. This {{is not the same as}} <b>an</b> electronic <b>musical</b> <b>instrument,</b> like <b>a</b> synthesizer, which uses entirely electronic means to both create and control sound.|$|R

5|$|His {{greatest}} {{and most}} famous wartime contribution was the Seventh Symphony. The composer {{wrote the first}} three movements in Leningrad and completed the work in Kuibyshev (now Samara) {{where he and his}} family had been evacuated. It remains unclear whether Shostakovich really conceived the idea of the symphony with the siege of Leningrad in mind, it was officially claimed as a representation of the people of Leningrad’s brave resistance to the German invaders and an authentic piece of patriotic art at a time when morale needed boosting. The symphony was first premiered by the Bolshoi Theatre orchestra in Kuibyshev and was soon performed abroad in London and the United States. The most compelling performance was the Leningrad premiere by the Radio Orchestra in the besieged city. The orchestra had only fourteen musicians left, so the conductor Karl Eliasberg had to recruit anyone who could play <b>a</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> to perform the symphony.|$|E
5|$|Music {{in early}} modern Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} musical production in Scotland between the early sixteenth century and the mid-eighteenth century. In this period the court followed the European trend for instrumental accompaniment and playing. Scottish monarchs {{of the sixteenth century}} were patrons of religious and secular music, and some were accomplished musicians. In the sixteenth century the playing of <b>a</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> and singing became an expected accomplishment of noble men and women. The departure of James VI to rule in London at the Union of Crowns in 1603, meant that the Chapel Royal, Stirling Castle largely fell into disrepair and the major source of patronage was removed from the country. Important composers of the early sixteenth century included Robert Carver and David Peebles. The Lutheranism of the early Reformation was sympathetic to the incorporation of Catholic musical traditions and vernacular songs into worship, exemplified by The Gude and Godlie Ballatis (1567). However, the Calvinism that came to dominate Scottish Protestantism led to the closure of song schools, disbanding of choirs, removal of organs and the destruction of music books and manuscripts. An emphasis was placed on the Psalms, resulting in the production of a series of Psalters {{and the creation of a}} tradition of unaccompanied singing.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{shock of}} the Spanish conquest was {{followed}} by decades of heavy exploitation of the indigenous peoples, allies and foes alike. Over the following two hundred years colonial rule gradually imposed Spanish cultural standards on the subjugated peoples. The Spanish reducciones created new nucleated settlements {{laid out in a}} grid pattern in the Spanish style, with a central plaza, a church and the town hall housing the civil government, known as the ayuntamiento. This style of settlement can still be seen in the villages and towns of the area. The civil government was either run directly by the Spanish and their descendents (the criollos) or was tightly controlled by them. The introduction of Catholicism was the main vehicle for cultural change, and resulted in religious syncretism. Old World cultural elements came to be thoroughly adopted by Maya groups, an example being the marimba, <b>a</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> of African origin. The greatest change was the sweeping aside of the pre-Columbian economic order and its replacement by European technology and livestock; this included the introduction of iron and steel tools to replace Neolithic tools, and of cattle, pigs and chickens that largely replaced the consumption of game. New crops were also introduced; however, sugarcane and coffee led to plantations that economically exploited native labour. Sixty per cent of the modern population of Guatemala is estimated to be Maya, concentrated in the central and western highlands. The eastern portion of the country was the object of intense Spanish migration and hispanicization. Guatemalan society is divided into a class system largely based on race, with Maya peasants and artisans at the bottom, the mixed-race ladino salaried workers and bureaucrats forming the middle and lower class and above them the creole elite of pure European ancestry. Some indigenous elites such as the Xajil did manage to maintain a level of status into the colonial period; a prominent Kaqchikel noble family, they chronicled the history of their region.|$|E
