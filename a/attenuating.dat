5|$|There are 57 {{nucleotide}} substitutions which {{distinguish the}} attenuated Sabin 1 strain from its virulent parent (the Mahoney serotype), two nucleotide substitutions attenuate the Sabin 2 strain, and 10 substitutions {{are involved in}} <b>attenuating</b> the Sabin 3 strain. The primary <b>attenuating</b> factor common to all three Sabin vaccines is a mutation located in the virus's internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which alters stem-loop structures, and reduces the ability of poliovirus to translate its RNA template within the host cell. The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of infection and replication, but is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue.|$|E

Monkeys {{infected with the}} highly <b>attenuated</b> or moderately <b>attenuated</b> viruses had minimal lymphoid hyperplasia, normal CD 4 /CD 8 ratios, low levels of SIV-specific antibodies, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity against p 55 gag (Gag) or gp 160 env (Env). Monkeys infected with the partially <b>attenuated</b> virus had moderate to marked lymphoid hyperplasia, normal CD 4 /CD 8 ratios, high levels of SIV-specific antibodies, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity against both Gag and Env. After pathogenic virus challenge, monkeys immunized with the partially <b>attenuated</b> virus had 100 - to 1, 000 -fold-lower viral load in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and lymph node mononuclear cells than naive control animals. One of four monkeys immunized with the highly <b>attenuated</b> virus and two of four monkeys immunized with the moderately <b>attenuated</b> virus developed similarly low viral loads after challenge. These three <b>attenuated</b> strains of SIV induced a spectrum of antiviral immunity that was inversely associated with their degree of attenuation.

40|$|The {{adenovirus}} 72 -kilodalton DNA-binding protein (DBP) binds to the <b>attenuated</b> RNA {{derived from}} the viral major late promoter. Protection from T 1 RNase digestion can be observed when DBP is incubated with <b>attenuated</b> RNA. By using <b>attenuated</b> RNA labeled at one end, the T 1 RNase digestion pattern can be mapped to residues located at specific sites in this RNA. Heterologous competitor RNAs do not alter the pattern of DBP protection of a labeled <b>attenuated</b> RNA, as does the identical <b>attenuated</b> RNA. These data indicate some specificity {{of the interaction between}} DBP and <b>attenuated</b> RNA. Adenovirus infection of monkey cells results in a more efficient attenuation of RNA initiated at the major late promoter and a reduced level of infectious virus. Adenovirus mutations in DBP relieve this restriction. These DBP mutant proteins do not change their binding properties to the <b>attenuated</b> RNA but suggest a mechanism by which DBP plays a role in the adenovirus host range restriction in monkey cells...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The set of subspaces {{of a given}} {{dimension}} in an <b>attenuated</b> space has a structure of a symmetric association scheme and this association scheme is called an association scheme based on an <b>attenuated</b> space.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to compute character tables of association schemes based on <b>attenuated</b> spaces using the method of Tarnanen, Aaltonen, and Goethals. Moreover, we also prove that association schemes based on <b>attenuated</b> spaces include as a special case the m-flat association scheme, which is defined on the set of cosets of subspaces of a constant {{dimension in}} a vector space over a finite field. ...|$|R
25|$|Study {{results of}} the {{long-term}} acoustic benefits of rubberized asphalt are inconclusive. Initial application of rubberized asphalt may provide 3–5 decibels (dB) reduction in tire-pavement source noise emissions; however, this translates to only 1–3 decibels (dB) in total traffic noise level reduction (due to the other components of traffic noise). Compared to traditional passive <b>attenuating</b> measures (e.g., noise walls and earth berms), rubberized asphalt provides shorter-lasting and lesser acoustic benefits at typically much greater expense.|$|E

25|$|The {{throstle}} and {{the later}} water frame pulled the rovings through {{a set of}} <b>attenuating</b> rollers. Spinning at differing speeds, these pulled the thread continuously while other parts twisted it as it wound onto the heavy spindles. This produced thread suitable for warp, but the multiple rollers required much more energy input and demanded that the device be driven by a water wheel. The early water frame, however, had only a single spindle. Combining ideas from these two system inspired the spinning mule.|$|E
50|$|Vaccines {{created through}} reverse {{genetics}} methods {{are known as}} <b>attenuated</b> vaccines, named because they contain weakened (<b>attenuated)</b> live viruses. <b>Attenuated</b> vaccines are created by combining genes from a novel or current virus strain with previously <b>attenuated</b> viruses of the same species. <b>Attenuated</b> viruses are created by propagating a live virus under novel conditions, such as a chicken’s egg. This produces a viral strain that is still live, but not pathogenic to humans, as these viruses are rendered defective in that they cannot replicate their genome enough to propagate and sufficiently infect a host. However, the viral genes are still expressed in the host's cell through a single replication cycle, allowing {{for the development of}} an immunity.|$|R
40|$|There {{is limited}} {{research}} on clinical features related to age of {{presentation of the}} <b>Attenuated</b> Psychosis Syndrome {{in children and adolescents}} (CAD). Based on findings in CAD with psychosis, we hypothesized that an older age at presentation of <b>Attenuated</b> Psychosis Syndrome would be associated with less severe symptoms and better psychosocial functioning than presentation in childhood or younger adolescence. Ninety-four CAD (age 9 - 18) meeting <b>Attenuated</b> Psychosis Syndrome criteria participated in the study. The sample was divided and compared according to the age of presentation of <b>Attenuated</b> Psychosis Syndrome (9 - 14 vs 15 - 18 years). The predictive value of age of <b>Attenuated</b> Psychosis Syndrome presentation was investigated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) -curve calculations. The two <b>Attenuated</b> Psychosis Syndrome groups were homogeneous in terms of gender distribution, IQ scores and comorbid diagnoses. Older <b>Attenuated</b> Psychosis Syndrome patients showed better functioning and lower depressive scores. ROC curves revealed that severity of functional impairment was best predicted using an age of presentation cut-off of 14. 9 years for social functioning and 15. 9 years for role functioning. This study partially confirmed our hypothesis; older age at presentation of <b>Attenuated</b> Psychosis Syndrome was associated with less functional impairment, but age was not associated with psychotic symptoms...|$|R

In addition, when inhibitor isolated from virulent cells was administered to mice challenged with <b>attenuated</b> cells, the latter cells became virulent in vivo. When <b>attenuated</b> and virulent cells were administered simultaneously in the same host, the <b>attenuated</b> cells were able to develop into progressively growing tumors. The data suggest that the successful growth of neoplastic cells in normal may require tumor cells to produce factors which subvert the ability of the host to mobilize macrophages rapidly at the tumor site...|$|R

However, starting with the efficacy of neuroleptic drugs in <b>attenuating</b> symptoms (Shapiro, Shapiro and Wayne, 1973) the syndrome has gained pathophysiological support (e.g. Singer, 1997) and is hypothesized to have a genetic basis too, based on its high inheritability (Robertson, 2000).

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of the California serogroup bunyaviruses {{includes both}} extraneural and intraneural replicative phases {{that can be}} separated experimentally. The present study dissects the viral genetic determinants of extraneural replication. We have previously described two <b>attenuated</b> reassortant clones of California serogroup bunyaviruses which exhibit reduced neuroinvasiveness after subcutaneous inoculation into suckling mice. Clone B 1 - 1 a bears an <b>attenuated</b> middle RNA segment (neuroinvasiveness phenotype v alpha v), and clone B. 5 bears an <b>attenuated</b> large RNA segment (neuroinvasiveness phenotype alpha vv). We prepared reassortant viruses between these two strains {{and found that the}} two <b>attenuated</b> gene segments acted independently and additively, since reassortants bearing two <b>attenuated</b> RNA segments were more <b>attenuated</b> than the parental clones. Reassortants bearing no <b>attenuated</b> RNA segments were much more neuroinvasive than either parental clone, indicating that a neuroinvasive strain can be derived from two <b>attenuated</b> clones. Pathogenesis studies demonstrated that after injection of 10 (3) PFU, the <b>attenuated</b> reassortant clones did not replicate in peripheral tissue, failed to reach the brain, and did not cause disease. At a dose of 10 (6) PFU, <b>attenuated</b> clones failed to replicate to a significant level in peripheral tissue and produced only a minimal passive plasma viremia during the first 24 h but nevertheless reached high titers in the brain and killed mice. Because of this result, we investigated the possibility that neuroinvasion occurs via retrograde axonal transport, by determining whether sciatic nerve sectioning could protect against virus infection after hind leg footpad inoculation. We found that nerve sectioning had no effect on lethality, ruling out this mode of entry and suggesting that passive viremia is likely to be sufficient for invasion of the central nervous system...|$|R
