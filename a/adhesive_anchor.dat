Abstract. <b>Adhesive</b> <b>anchor</b> is an {{effective}} tool for a steel-to-concrete connection combined with the way of post-installed anchorage. However the bond strength of adhesive will decrease at elevated temperature which has {{a negative effect on}} anchorage behavior. In this paper a numerical analysis with 3 D FE model has been carried out to investigate the tensile performance of <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchor</b> in a steel-to-concrete connection subjected to fire and the results show that high temperature have significant impact on bond strength of anchor even with the protection of fire resisting coating covering the surface of concrete base and the bond stress does not distribute along anchor length during the process of heating.

A post-installed <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchor</b> construction method 1) is a method whereby a hole is drilled in the base concrete and then mortar or the like is filled using capsules or is injected around the anchor rebar to integrate the anchor rebar with the base concrete. The mortar or the like around the anchor rebar exhibits pullout resistance for the anchor rebar when solidified. Pullout resistance of a post-installed <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchor</b> depends on the adhesive strength of individual components of that anchor.

40|$|In {{this and}} in the {{companion}} paper, the mechanical response of <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchor</b> systems is theoretically and numerically predicted and experimentally observed. The theoretical prediction is {{on the basis of}} an elastoplastic damaging model formulated to predict the structural response associated with the development of a fracture in <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchor</b> systems. This part describes the analytical model developed in the framework of a thermodynamically consistent theory, which assumes adhesion where the structure is sound, and friction in correspondence with the fracture. Isotropic damage is considered. The model can predict the structural behavior at the interface between two surfaces of ductile, brittle, or quasi-brittle materials. The Helmholtz free energy is written to model the materials' hardening or softening. Isotropic damage is considered, and the possible effects of dilatancy are taken into account, including nonassociative flow rules. The formulation is implemented into the finite-element code FEAP. In the companion paper, the new model is adopted to predict the mechanical response to the pullout force of postinstalled rebar chemically bonded in concrete. The analytical model and the numerical implementation are experimentally validated by several pullout tests, which are monitored by using an acoustic-emission technique...|$|E
40|$|The use of Glued In Rod joints for wooden constructions is an {{efficient}} technology to connect and design members in new timber structures and to rehabilitate the damaged structural elements of historical buildings. The major issue concerning {{the use of}} <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchors</b> in timber {{is the lack of}} a standard regulation in the current Eurocode 5 for timber structures. Due to the gap in knowledge of this specific topic in engineering structural design, designers' choices are still supported by test analysis which enables knowledge, and the prediction, of the structural behaviour of Glued In Rod joints. Over the last 30 years, research studies have suggested diverse and contradictory procedures for the prediction of the withdrawal capacity of <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchors</b> in timber whose application led to the relay of inconsistent information about the use of Glued In Rods in the timber engineering field. The presented research work is aimed at clarifying the contradictory nature amongst existing design rules and at proposing a correct design procedure to assess the load bearing capacity of <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchors</b> in timber, whilst also taking into consideration the high product-dependency which Glued In Rod connections are characterised by. Moreover, the thesis investigates the development of new prototypes of resin connectors in timber through the identification of innovative technical solutions in order to achieve an improved structural performance of the studied adhesive joints.

40|$|Abstract. Four steel-to-concrete {{connections}} with <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchor</b> groups under reversed cyclic loading have been tested. The {{results showed that}} anchor steel could reach yield strength before connection failure, generating small shell-shaped concrete cone in the surface of block and the ultimate capacity was governed by strength of anchor. Seismic characteristics of hysteresis curve, rigidity regression, ductility and energy-dissipation were used to draw conclusions that the connections would behave in a ductile manner without significant loss of loading capacity after peak value and visible deformation could develop until failure occurred. Increased embedment depth and added amount of anchors were helpful to improve seismic performance of connections. Only the outer row of most stressed anchors in the tension zone were needed to meet the elliptical interaction of tension and shear capacity requirement during the design process of anchor groups under combined shear and moment loading. In seismic design of steel-to-concrete connections, the predicted capacity by a reduction factor of 0. 8 was advised and the comparison of calculated versus observed capacity presented limited variance...|$|E

40|$|Various {{anchorage}} systems {{including both}} cast-in-place and post-installed anchors {{have been developed}} for fastening both non-structural and structural components to concrete structures. The need for increased flexibility in the design of new structures and strengthening of existing concrete structures has led to increased use of various metallic anchors in practice. Although millions of fasteners are used each year in the construction industry around the world, knowledge of the fastening technology remains poor. In a sustainable society, buildings and structures must, from time to time, be adjusted to meet new demands. Loads on structures must, in general, be increased to comply with new demands, and the structural components and the structural connections must also be upgraded. From the structural connection point of view, the adequacy of the current fastenings for the intended increased load must be determined, and inadequate fastenings must either be replaced or upgraded. The current design models are generally believed to be conservative, although the extent of this behavior is not very clear. To address these issues, the current models must be refined to allow the design of new fastenings and also the assessment of current anchorage systems in practice. The research presented in this thesis consists of numerical and experimental studies of the load-carrying capacity of anchors in concrete structures. Two different types of anchors were studied: (I) cast-in-place headed anchors, and (II) post-installed <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchors.</b> This research focused particularly on the tensile load-carrying capacity of cast-in-place headed anchors and also on the sustained tension loading performance of post-installed <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchors.</b> The overall objective of this research was to provide knowledge for the development of improved methods of designing new fastening systems and assessing the current anchorage systems in practice. For the cast-in-place headed anchors (I), the influence of various parameters including the size of anchor head, thickness of concrete member, amount of orthogonal surface reinforcement, presence of concrete cracks, concrete compressive strength, and addition of steel fibers to concrete were studied. Among these parameters, the influence of the anchor head size, member thickness, surface reinforcement, and cracked concrete was initially evaluated via numerical analysis of headed anchors at various embedment depths. Although these parameters have considerable influence on the anchorage capacity and performance, this influence is not explicitly considered by the current design models. The numerical results showed that the tensile breakout capacity of headed anchors increases with increasing member thickness and/or increasing size of the anchor head or the use of orthogonal surface reinforcement. However, their capacity decreased considerably in cracked concrete. Based on the numerical results, the current theoretical model for the tensile breakout capacity of headed anchors was extended by incorporating several modification factors that take the influence of the investigated parameters into account. In addition, a supplementary experimental study was performed to verify the numerically obtained findings and the proposed refined model. The experimental results corresponded closely to the numerical results, both in terms of failure load and failure pattern, thereby confirming the validity of the proposed model. The validity of the model was further confirmed through experimental results reported in the literature. Additional experiments were performed to determine the influence of the concrete compressive strength and the addition of steel fiber to concrete on the anchorage capacity and performance. These experiments showed that the anchorage capacity and stiffness increase considerably with increasing concrete compressive strength, but the ductility of the anchor decreases. However, the anchorage capacity and ductility increased significantly with the addition of steel fibers to the concrete mixture. The test results also revealed that the tensile breakout capacity of headed anchors in steel fiber-reinforced concrete is significantly underestimated by the current design model. The long-term performance and creep behavior of the post-installed headed anchors (II) was evaluated from the results of long-time tests on <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchors</b> under sustained loads. In this experimental study, <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchors</b> of various sizes were subjected to various sustained load levels for up to 28 years. The anchors were also exposed to several in-service conditions including indoor temperature, variations in the outdoor temperature and humidity, wetness (i. e., water on the surface of concrete), and the presence of salt (setting accelerant) additives in the concrete. Among the tested in-service conditions, variations in the outdoor temperature and humidity had the most adverse effect on the long-term sustained loading performance of the anchors. Based on the test results, recommendations were proposed for maximum sustained load levels under various conditions. The anchors tested under indoor conditions could carry sustained loads of up to 47 % of their mean ultimate short-term capacities. However, compared with these anchors, the anchors tested under outdoor conditions exhibited larger creep deformation and failure occurred at sustained loads higher than 23 % of their mean ultimate short-term capacities. Salt additives in concrete and wet conditions had negligible influence on the long-term performance of the anchors, although the wet condition resulted in progressive corrosion of the steel. Based on the experimental results, the suitability of the current testing and approval provisions for qualifying <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchors</b> subjected to long-term sustained tensile loads was evaluated. The evaluations revealed that the current approval provisions are not necessarily reliable for qualifying <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchors</b> for long-term sustained loading applications.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} the main {{characteristics of the}} mechanical behaviour of adhesive anchors installed in concrete. They are the mechanisms of failure, the relationship between applied pull-out'loadand slip of the anchor and the stresses and strains {{in each of the}} three components (steel-resin'-concrete). The study is-primarily-experimental [...] but theoretical and finite element analyses are also included. These main characteristics are dependent on the'adhesion and wetting phenomena across the resin-conciete and resin-steel interfaces, and on a series of parameters relating to geometry, properties of materials and methods of installation. The principal conclusions obtained are: a) The combined mode of failure involving concreter resin tensile and interfacial bond failure, is the most probable provided that the resin has a high adhesive strength and that the anchor diameter is larger than the minimum value necessary to prevent steel failure, which can be calculated. b) The sequence of failure in the combined mode is concrete failure in the upper part,,, bond failure in the remaining part of the anchor and resin tensile fracture at the bottom of the anchor. c) The values of pull-out load normalized with respect to concrete strength, PuNfCCO, can be 29 - regarded as independent of concrete strength. Therefore, a limit state design criterion for adhesive anchors in any concrete substrate can be established. d) The values of anchor displacement normalized with respect to concrete strength, 6., Vfcco, vary linearly with it. Based upon this, a simple mathematical function can be determined, which allows the calculation of the displacement of any <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchor.</b> This can be used as a design criterion for the, limit state of serviceability of the particular system...|$|E
40|$|Bilayered {{material}} {{systems are}} common in naturally formed or artificially engineered structures. Understanding how loads transfer within these structural systems is necessary to predict failure and develop effective designs. Existing methods for evaluating the stress transfer in bilayered materials are limited to overly simplified models or require experimental calibration. As a result, these methods have failed to accurately account for such structural failures as the creep induced roofing panel collapse of Boston's I- 90 connector tunnel, which was supported by adhesive anchors. The one-dimensional stress analyses currently used for <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchor</b> design cannot account for viscoelastic creep failure, and consequently results in dangerously under-designed structural systems. In this dissertation, a method for determining the two-dimensional stress and displacement fields for a generalized bilayered material system is developed, and proposes a closed-form analytical solution. A general linear-elastic solution is first proposed by decoupling the elastic governing equations from one another through the so-called plane assumption. Based on this general solution, an axisymmetric problem and a plane strain problem are formulated. These are applied to common bilayered material systems such as: (1) concrete adhesive anchors, (2) material coatings, (3) asphalt pavements, and (4) layered sedimentary rocks. The stress and displacement fields determined by this analytical analysis are validated {{through the use of}} finite element models. Through the correspondence principle, the linear-elastic solution is extended to consider time-dependent viscoelastic material properties, thus facilitating the analysis of adhesive anchors and asphalt pavements while incorporating their viscoelastic material behavior. Furthermore, the elastic stress analysis can explain the fracturing phenomenon of material coatings, pavements, and layered rocks, successfully predicting their fracture saturation ratio [...] which is the ratio of fracture spacing to the thickness of the weak layer where an increase in load will not cause any new fractures to form. Moreover, these specific material systems are looked at in the context of existing and novel experimental results, further demonstrating the advantage of the stress transfer analysis proposed. This research provides a closed-form stress solution for various structural systems that is applied to different failure analyses. The versatility of this method is in the flexibility and the ease upon which the stress and displacement field results can be applied to existing stress- or displacement-based structural failure criteria. As presented, this analysis can be directly used to: (1) design adhesive anchoring systems for long-term creep loading, (2) evaluate the fracture mechanics behind bilayered material coatings and pavement overlay systems, and (3) determine the fracture spacing to layer thickness ratio of layered sedimentary rocks. As is shown in the four material systems presented, this general solution has far reaching applications in facilitating design and analysis of typical bilayered structural systems...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an experimental {{study on the}} long-term creep behaviour of <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchors</b> under sustained tensile loads in combination with different environmental exposures. A comprehensive background and literature review is presented, focusing on various bond stress models for <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchors,</b> factors affecting their bond behavior, and an overview of available testing standards and evaluation criteria. The experimental program comprises of 82 test specimens. The specimens consist of a cylindrical shaped concrete block of 300 mm (12 inch) in diameter and 200 mm (8 inch) in depth, with 15 M (No. 5) deformed steel bar post-installed to an embedment depth of six times the bar diameter or 125 mm (5 inch). Three types of adhesives were used for anchor installation: Type-A a fast setting two component methyl methacrylate adhesive, Type-B a fast setting two part epoxy adhesive, and Type-C a standard set two part epoxy adhesive. The study is divided into four phases. Phase I consists of 27 static pullout tests to determine the yield strength (fy) and the maximum tensile capacity of each anchor system under three exposure conditions. Phase II and Phase III consist of 36 specimens tested under sustained load levels of 40 %fy (32 kN) and 60 %fy (48 kN) under normal laboratory conditions (room temperature) and moisture exposure, respectively. Phase IV consists of 9 specimens tested under sustained load with a load level of 40 %fy (32 kN) with exposure to freeze/thaw cycling. All sustained load tests lasted {{for a period of}} at least 90 days. The results of the static pullout testing showed that specimens with epoxy based adhesive exhibited stronger bond strength, forcing the anchor to fail by rupture prior to bond failure. Under sustained load testing, specimens with standard set epoxy based adhesive showed insignificant creep displacement under room conditions, however, when exposed to moisture noticeable creep displacements were recorded. Specimens with both fast setting epoxy and methyl methacrylate based adhesives showed higher creep displacements under environmental exposure (moisture, freeze/thaw) versus those kept at room temperature. Displacement data from creep testing were analysed and projected over a service life span of 50 years for room temperature exposure, and for 10 years for moisture and freeze/thaw exposures. Based on the analysis results, the service life of different anchor systems was estimated. An integrated qualification and testing protocol is proposed for the creep behavior of <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchors</b> under various environmental exposures...|$|R

These updates are informed by performance observations of unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings in the recent Christchurch (New Zealand) earthquakes and recent research, including component testing. New evaluation provisions include the classification of bed joint sliding and stair-stepped bed joint sliding as deformationcontrolled modes of behavior. Provisions to evaluate diagonal tension strength are reintroduced from precursors to the standard. The provisions for rocking walls and piers are also substantially revised, to explicitly consider strength and stiffness degradation, and deformation capacities based on testing and other rational limit states. Guidance is also provided via commentary for the effects that flanges and spandrels have on in-plane wall or pier response. The wall anchorage provisions are proposed to be expanded to address chemical <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchors</b> in conjunction with installation quality assurance requirements. The performance criteria for out-of-plane wall actions are updated based on a review of currently available research. Improved modelling guidance is also provided via commentary to address the unique modeling and evaluation limitations that apply to URM buildings, including their resilience relative to other types of construction, as supported by performance observations from recent major earthquakes.

40|$|Post {{installed}} anchors come {{in either}} mechanical anchors that develop their strength purely through mechanical interlock with the base concrete, or bonded anchors that develop their strength by bonding anchor rod {{to the base}} concrete. Bonded anchors are either grouted, typically cementitious material, or adhesive, typically a chemical material. This thesis presents a current literature review of post-installed bonded anchors, preliminary testing of <b>adhesive</b> bonded <b>anchors,</b> and details of short term and long term test setups for future testing. The purpose of this thesis was to develop the test setups {{that will be used}} for future testing on anchors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:The creep {{character}} of anchor rod in argillaceous soft rock is remarkable. The big undisturbed mudstone samples in Nanning Basin {{as a typical}} argillaceous soft rock is chosen to the research object in this paper. The laboratory simulated destructive tests and the creep tests of full grouted anchor rod have been down. Through the destructive tests of mudstone sample, the instantaneous adhesive strength between the anchor body and mudstone in Nanning Basin is 70 kPa. By analyzing the creep curves of anchor rod, a conclusion {{is that there is}} a long-term <b>adhesive</b> strength of <b>anchor</b> rod in argillaceous soft rock. When the design <b>adhesive</b> strength of <b>anchor</b> rod is less than the long-term adhesive strength, eventually the anchor rod is stable during the process of long-term pull-out. When the design <b>adhesive</b> strength of <b>anchor</b> rod is greater than the value, the creep of anchor rod with the time will do not stop until the anchor rod failure. The greater difference value between the instantaneous and long-term adhesive strength, the faster the rate of creep, the faster the anchor rod failure. Finally, for the permanent support engineering design of anchor rod in argillaceous soft rock, the paper gives two principles, as follows: (1) the design of anchor rod in argillaceous soft rock must be determined according to the long-term adhesive strength. (2) by using variety of technical measures, the impact of various factors on the creep of anchor rod will be decreased...|$|R
40|$|Under {{contract}} to the Dutch Department of Public Works Civil Engineering Division, SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research carried out simulation {{studies on the}} development of H 4 -level safety barriers. These included steel and concrete designs for a wide STEP barrier. Anchoring of these constructions in concrete was always the starting point for research simulations. The steel STEP barrier also had to be capable of being used with asphalt. However, there was no useful information available about anchoring in asphalt. This was therefore the basis for this research involving a number of loading tests. Three types of anchor bolts were tested. Two of these, the so-called "VD" anchor and the "VD-I" <b>anchor,</b> were <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchors.</b> The third anchor, the so-called "Schweizer Riegel" (SR) anchor, was a mechanical one. The anchors consisted of M 24 studs with an 8. 8 quality rating. The placement depth was varied with the "VD" anchors, and a range of speeds and forces was tested with the "SR" anchors and the "VD-I" anchors. The most important conclusion from this research was that "SR" anchoring is a good option for anchoring in asphalt at H 4 level. The research simulations for the STEP barrier involved four anchors, each with four anchor bolts, that together could absorb 1600 kN of tensile force. Four "SR" anchors, with four bolts per anchor, were more than sufficient to absorb this force (maximum force 2768 kN). "VD" and "VD-I" anchors with the same configuration were unable to absorb sufficient force. (A...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} stages of an infection, {{pathogenic}} bacteria use long fibrous structures known as pili as <b>adhesive</b> <b>anchors</b> for attachment to the host cells. These structures also play key roles in colony and biofilm formation. In all those processes, pili must withstand large mechanical forces. The pili of the nasty Gram-positive human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes are assembled as single, micrometer long tandem modular proteins of covalently linked repeats of pilin proteins. Here we use single molecule force spectroscopy techniques to study the mechanical properties of the major pilin Spy 0128. In our studies, we engineer polyproteins containing repeats of Spy 0128 flanked by the well characterized I 27 protein which provides an unambiguous mechanical fingerprint. We find that Spy 0128 is an inextensible protein, even when pulled at forces of up to 800 pN. We also found that this remarkable mechanical resilience, unique among the modular proteins studied to date, results from the strategically located intramolecular isopeptide bonds recently identified in the x-ray structure of Spy 0128. Removal of the isopeptide bonds by mutagenesis readily allowed Spy 0128 domains to unfold and extend, albeit at relatively high forces of 172 pN (N-terminal domain) or 250 pN (C-terminal domain). Our results show that in contrast to the elastic roles played by large tandem modular proteins such as titin and fibronectin, the giant pili of S. pyogenes evolved to abrogate mechanical extensibility, a property that may be crucial in the pathogenesis of this most virulent bacterium and, therefore, become the target of new therapeutic approaches against its infections...|$|R
