And I think we showed too much. I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> far.|$|E
5|$|Before Crisis began {{development}} in 2002. The Compilation was first unveiled in 2003 with {{the announcement of}} Advent Children. None of the titles in the series {{up to that point}} were traditional role-playing games like the original. The explanation for this was that traditional RPGs took long production periods and a large staff, which would have made the project stand out <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> much. One of the other considerations for the team was not to make the titles lightweight as X-2 had been, due to backlash from parts of the fanbase. Conversely, making Final Fantasy X-2 reminded the team that they did not need to stick to completely serious traditional RPGs, enabling the original creation of the Compilation. While Advent Children was the first Compilation title to begin production, it ran into problems during post-production, resulting in the first released title being Before Crisis, despite it being the second title to begin development. Before Crisis was also originally planned for release in North America, but the mobile phones available in North America at the time were not able to handle the game. In addition, the producer Kosei Ito left Square Enix in 2008 and Tabata moved on to other projects, leaving its localization unlikely. Japanese animation studio Madhouse created a commercial to promote Before Crisis. Due to its success and staff feelings that important scenes from VII represented in Advent Children had been needlessly disjointed, the studio was chosen to produce an animated film: this eventually became Last Order. Crisis Core was originally going to be an action game, but became an action RPG, staying within the staff's design strengths while incorporating action elements.|$|E
25|$|One of {{his initial}} {{projects}} {{was to make}} a song for a twelve-year-old mayor's daughter named Sharon Cuneta. It was a daunting challenge, as Rey initially could not figure out what kind song would be fitting for her; she was too young to be taken seriously to be given a love song, and <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> old to be given a nursery rhyme.|$|E

25|$|Maurice {{is seen as}} an able {{emperor and}} commander-in-chief, though the {{description}} by Theophylact may be <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> glorifying. He possessed insight, public spirit, and courage. He proved his expertise on military and foreign affairs during his campaigns against the Persians, Avars and Slavs, and also during peace negotiations with Khosrau II. His administrative reforms reveal him as a farsighted statesman, all the more since they outlasted his death by far and were the basis for the introduction of such themes as military districts.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, all {{the buzz}} about the Packer affair, which looked such a menace in 78, died down {{within a year}} or so, as the richest man in Australia and the ICC managed to reach an agreement. Yet, the changes {{introduced}} by Packer have not only lasted for a considerable time, in fact, these have continued to produce more changes to the game. Cricket is now fully internationalized, {{and at the same time}} fully commercialized. International stars are now richly paid (and so are the commentators), thanks mainly to the backings and blessings of satellite TV channels. In a sense, Packer was <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> ahead of his time.|$|E
25|$|The {{maximum age}} of the Unkar Group is also {{established}} by uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating of zircons from an ash bed from the Bass Formation in the basal Unkar Group of 1254 Ma near river Mile 78 (List of Colorado River rapids and features). The dating of detrital zircons from the Bass Formation have yielded dates of about 1200 Ma. These dates suggest that the 1254 Ma age may be <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> old. However, these zircons likely underwent some lead loss, and, as a result these apparent dates are younger than their actual ages. As a result, the 1254 Ma dates remain the best estimate for the age of initial deposition of the Unkar Group.|$|E

25|$|In a mixed {{review of}} the book in the Wall Street Journal, William Easterly was {{generally}} supportive of the plausibility of the book's thesis but critiqued the book's failure to cite extant statistics-based {{evidence to support the}} validity of the historical case studies. For example, in the book's example about Congo, the stated reason Congo is impoverished is that Congo is close to slave trade shipping points. The approach of this historical case study only offers one data point. Moreover, Easterly also points out the danger of ex-post rationalization that the book only attributes different levels of development to institutions in a way <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> neat. For example, to explain the fall of Venice, it could be the extractive regime during the time or it could also be the shift from Mediterranean trade to Atlantic trade. The historical case studies approach might be biased.|$|E
25|$|Dan Byrd as Travis Cobb – Jules' and Bobby's son, who is {{a senior}} in high school at the start of the series, then later attends a local college. He loves both of his parents {{although}} he is frequently embarrassed by both of them. In high school, he dealt with humiliation from his friends and classmates but has made friends at college. He is generally supportive of his mother, but finds her parenting style <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> smothering. After dealing with his mom's real estate ads around town and his dad's new job as his former high school's grass cutter, his father helps him realize not to worry about what other people think. Spending a lot of time with his parents and their friends, he often flirts with Laurie and is shown to have a crush on her. At the end of season 4 he gets together with Laurie. During season 5 their relationship is shown to be in constant competition with Jules and Grayson's, and he and Laurie have a son named Bobby at the beginning of Season 6. He has a passion for photography and attends art college. Finding few career prospects after graduating college, he starts a mobile wine delivery business.|$|E

[...] UGO's Darren Latta noted as a downside to the series that [...] "the approach maybe a little too subdued at times." [...] Latta also felt that despite being familiar with the setting, Gaiman never utilized the period to its full potential. Others simply felt that Gaiman's involvement led to inflated expectations; one review noted that while reading [...] "I [...] felt at times like maybe it was all <b>a</b> little <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> cute, <b>a</b> little <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> in-jokey." ...|$|R

A. E. Sparrow from IGN praised how the introduction of Mello, [...] "a man of action", [...] "spiced things up a bit" [...] as he brought [...] "actually" [...] action to the series. Manga News said Mello is [...] "an interesting character" [...] as he is [...] "unpredictable" [...] and also praised the action scenes he brings. As such, they criticized his almost total absence in volume 10 as he is [...] "one of the few to bring some new blood to the series". After Mello's death, Pepirium wrote [...] "Mello deserved more." [...] On the other hand, Mello is [...] "an unhinged character that only offers unpredictability", according to Chris Beveridge of Mania.com. AnimeLand and Manga News presented opposite opinions if whether or not Mello is charismatic character, with the former declaring he does not replace L as he lacks charisma.|$|E

500|$|Geoffrey Rush as the Narrator. The filmmakers {{approached}} Rush with {{copies of}} Elliot's three previous short films {{to ask him}} to be involved in Harvie Krumpet. Rush recorded the narration at the beginning of production on the film, so that his dialogue could be used to guide the animators in determining the length of each shot.

500|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} Dean Carlson {{disliked the}} album, {{giving it a}} rating of {{one and a half}} stars. He described it as [...] "little more than a slightly off-base perspective into the world of mid-90s American grunge", and described it as highly similar to Neil Young. Carlson's only praise was for songs [...] "Odyssey #5" [...] and [...] "My Happiness", stating that [...] "oo often, Powderfinger is too earnest, <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> careful in their career". Carlson noted that despite his critique, the album achieved some success in the American market.|$|E
