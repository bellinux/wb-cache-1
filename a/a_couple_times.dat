He followed this performance with seven more shutout innings and some personal offensive contribution {{at the plate}} against the Rockies in a 10–0 win to complete a 3-game series sweep. It was the Giants' 16th straight victory {{in a row in}} games started by Zito (including the 2012 regular season and postseason), the longest such streak by a Giants pitcher since 1936 by Hall of Fame left-handed pitcher Carl Hubbell.

5|$|This {{extremely}} long-tracked EF4 tornado {{touched down}} near Raleigh, Mississippi, in Smith County at 5:42p.m. CDT (2242 UTC), and {{continued into the}} Uniontown, Alabama area before dissipating. The tornado initially downed trees, blew skirting from mobile homes, and tore shingles from roofs. The tornado intensified as it moved northeast across Smith County and produced up to EF2 and EF3 damage. One mobile home was picked up, bounced <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>times,</b> and thrown into a tree line, where it was torn apart and debris was scattered up to a mile away, including the frame. The tornado mowed down a stand of pine trees and destroyed two frame houses, with major damage to the interior walls, and the exterior walls completely destroyed. Many power poles were snapped, a mobile home was annihilated, and a large shop building was completely destroyed as well. It then moved into Jasper County and snapped and debarked many pine trees. The first area of EF4 damage was observed near Louin as a frame home and several mobile homes were completely destroyed, with parts of the mobile homes being thrown long distances, {{and some of the}} frame home foundation being swept clean. The tornado caused significant damage to a poultry farm and cattle ranch before it weakened briefly. It then destroyed two mobile homes and caused extensive tree and power line damage. The tornado then produced a relatively narrow path of EF1-strength tree and power line damage for several miles, until re-intensifying near to EF3 strength near Rose Hill.|$|E

30|$|MD {{simulation}} of the systems, {{reported in the}} present study, were carried out with GROMACS 4.0. 7, using Gromos 96 (ffG 45 a 3) force field. The temperature of the peptide, lipid, and the water molecules were separately <b>coupled</b> to <b>a</b> Berendsen thermostat at 310 K with <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>time</b> of 0.1 ps. For simulating the individual TMDs, a fully isotropic pressure coupling was applied with <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>time</b> of 1.0 ps and a compressibility 4.5 e- 5 bar- 1. The monomer was simulated with a semi isotropic pressure coupling scheme. Long range electrostatics had been calculated using the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm with grid dimensions of 0.12 nm and interpolation order 4. Lennard-Jones and short-range Coulomb interactions were cut off at 1.4 and 1 nm, respectively.|$|R

500|$|Daavettila {{graduated}} from Michigan Tech in 2008 and tried {{out for the}} Flint Generals of the International Hockey League (IHL). He appeared in two games for the Generals {{at the end of}} the season (for only about three shifts), and did not register a point. Daavettila had not originally planned to pursue a professional hockey career, but said [...] "When I got one skate with Flint, it kind of sparked my interest and I decided to give it a try". During the off-season, Daavettila worked for a structural engineering firm in Saginaw, Michigan. He used vacation time at the start of the next hockey season later in 2008 to try out for the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Muskegon Lumberjacks (IHL), though he was rejected by both teams. Tryouts with two more IHL teams, the Kalamazoo Wings and the Bloomington PrairieThunder, did not result in a contract either. Daavettila assumed his hockey career was over and went back to his engineering job, but he continued to skate <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>times</b> a week. He had left an impression on Kalamazoo coach Nick Bootland, however, who called Daavettila back in March 2009 after his team was depleted by injuries. [...] "You could see he had a skill set," [...] said Bootland. [...] "But I thought the way he held on to the puck, he was going to get himself killed. ... You kept thinking he was going to make a mistake. Then he'd pop a guy for a breakaway." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 2007, AAA {{created a}} ring persona {{for a new}} wrestler called Black Abyss; the gimmick {{featured}} the same mask and attire as Negro and used a similar wrestling style to Negro as well. Initially, {{it was believed that}} this was done because there were rumors of him jumping to CMLL or to cover several no-shows. In 2008, Negro's [...] "almost winning" [...] streak at Rey de Reyes continued as he lost in the final to El Zorro. Black Abyss made sure Negro did not win but interfering on Zorro's behalf during the match, furthering the storyline between the two. During the fall of 2008, AAA pushed the storyline further by having Black Abyss [...] "injure" [...] Negro with his own trademark move the [...] "Martinete". Abismo Negro was scheduled to take part in Triplemanía XVI in a match where he would face Los Vipers (Psicosis, Histeria, Black Abyss and Mr. Niebla) in a cage match, but in {{the weeks leading up to}} the show Abismo Negro suffered an injury and the match had to be cancelled, AAA used the attack at Rey de Reyes as a storyline explanation of why the match did not take place. At the 2008 Guerra de Titanes, Negro returned to challenge Los Vipers' Revolution and specifically Black Abyss. Subsequently, the storyline between Negro and Black Abyss seemed to be building to a Luchas de Apuestas fight between the two, with their masks on the line. Both Abismo and Black Abyss were booked in the same four-way elimination match qualifier at the Rey de Reyes (2009) event. Negro was able to eliminate Black Abyss from the match but was in turn eliminated by Latin Lover. Black Abyss still competed under the Black Abyss name, still as a rudo, but seemingly only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>times</b> on TV since then. Black Abyss has stated his wishes to continue with the character to honor the memory of Abismo Negro, but AAA didn't shown a lot of interest in using it on TV. In October 2010 it was reported that Black Abyss had left AAA.|$|E

2500|$|The entire {{album was}} {{recorded}} in secrecy from the music industry, critics, and fans of the band. Stump recalled: [...] "There was <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>times</b> there was paparazzi that got us outside and didn't put two and two together". The decision to keep recording a secret was partially so that the group members had the option to not make the record if the sessions did not work out. Keeping the secret was difficult, especially for a group so visible on social media; Hurley stayed away from Twitter, and all members got {{as far away from}} one another in public as possible. Rumors began to swirl in late 2012 after a friend of the band tweeted that the band {{was in the process of}} recording new material, though each member of the band was quick to deny any chance of a reunion. The band remained tight-lipped until the very end; when the Chicago Tribune asked Wentz a week prior to the announcement whether a Fall Out Boy reunion was happening, he replied: [...] "It's not." [...] Plans nearly went sideways when Wentz went to dinner with rapper 2 Chainz to discuss plans for the [...] "My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)" [...] video. Following the conversation, 2 Chainz posted to Instagram a photo of Wentz and himself with the caption [...] "Fall Out Boyz feat. 2 Chainz?" [...] To the members of Fall Out Boy's surprise and relief, fans of the band denied the possibility, finding the idea too absurd. Stump recalls he wrote [...] "somewhere near 25%" [...] of the lyrics, the most since on Take This to Your Grave.|$|E
