40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>twine</b> <b>thickness</b> on the selectivity of multifilament gillnet targeting bogue,Boops boops L., four different stations were sampled between March and November 2008 in the northern Aegean Sea. Gillnets with 22, 23, and 25 mm nominal mesh size (bar length) each having two different <b>twine</b> <b>thicknesses</b> (approximately 0. 45 mm and 0. 54 mm ∅) were applied for this purpose. The deviances from the SELECT method revealed that lognormal models provided the best fits for both of the <b>twine</b> <b>thicknesses.</b> Results from the two-way ANOVA analyses revealed that the mean total lengths increased with the mesh size (F = 87. 36; df = 2; P < 0. 0001) and decreased with the <b>twine</b> <b>thickness</b> (F = 46. 12; df = 1; P < 0. 0001). The 22 mm mesh size net (0. 45 mm ∅) captured significantly larger fish than the 23 mm mesh size net (0. 54 mm ∅) {{probably due to the}} higher elasticity and flexibility of the thinner twine. Thus, fisheries managers should take into consideration the <b>twine</b> <b>thickness</b> while advising mesh size regulations in gillnet fisheries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The flow {{characteristics}} through and around a net panel {{have been investigated}} through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and measurements. A finite volume approach was used for solving the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes equations combined with a k–ε turbulence model for describing the flow. For computational efficiency, the net was modeled as a sheet of porous media rather than {{a large number of}} cylinders connected by knots. The model resistance coefficients needed for the porous media equations were found by optimizing the fit between computed lift and drag forces on the net panel and lift and drag measured in tow tank experiments. Lift and drag acting on a flat panel of knotless nylon net (2. 8 mm <b>twine</b> <b>thickness</b> and 29 mm mesh size) stretched on a frame were measured at different speeds and angles of attack, and fluid velocity was recorded in the region behind the net. The optimization process used to obtain the best fit porous media coefficients was simplified through the use of an analytical model. Final comparisons between CFD predictions and measurements of lift and drag coefficients and velocity reduction behind the net panel were made for two of the speeds and angles of attack. The agreement between measured and modeled data was good with a mean normalized absolute error of 6. 2 %...|$|R
40|$|Trawls and {{plankton}} nets {{are basically}} {{made up of}} conical and cylindrical net sections. In conical sections the flow will pass through the inclined net wall with a noticeable angle of attack, and then the flow, filtration and drag can be suitably modelled e. g. by a pressure drop approach [1]. In cylindrical and other non-tapered net sections, such as foreparts and extension pieces in trawls and plankton nets, the flow is directed along the net wall and is best considered {{in terms of a}} boundary layer. Boundary layer theory and turbulence models can be used to describe such flow, but this requires extensive numerical modelling and computational effort. Simplified approximate formulas providing a qualitative description of the flow with some quantitative accuracy are therefore also useful. This work presents simplified parametric expressions for boundary layer flow in cylindrical net sections, including the boundary layer thickness and growth rate along the net, the filtration velocity out of the net wall, the decrease in mass flux through the net due to the growing boundary layer, and the effect of <b>twine</b> <b>thickness,</b> flow (towing) velocity and the dimensions of the net. These expressions may be useful for assessing the existence and extension of a boundary layer, for appropriate scaling of boundary layer effects in model tests, for proper placement of velocity measurement probes, for assessing the influence on filtration and clogging of plankton net sections, and more...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} the twine/mesh ratio on the flow through a porous hollow {{cylinder}} of diameter D has been experimentally investigated at Reynolds number Re = 800 with a surface porosity varying from 0. 67 to 0. 90. Our porous cylinder models are inspired by aquaculture pens in that they have similar geometries, and porosities, to those nets commonly used within the aquaculture industry. We show that the surface porosity alone is not the key parameter determining the flow topology of the model, but rather a non-dimensional parameter α=t⁰˙⁵D⁰˙⁵/m (based upon <b>twine</b> <b>thickness</b> t, mesh void m and cylinder diameter D) effectively collapses first-order moments. Three different wake regimes are observed in the flow for different twine/mesh ratios: a laminar flow regime where streamlines pass through the model without significant deformation; a partially occluded flow, where the mean flow is decelerated, and a flow with a fully developed recirculation zone exhibiting a von Kármán vortex street similar to that produced {{in the wake of}} a solid cylinder. Our observation that the flow structure depends upon the parameter α, rather than simply the surface porosity, is supported by calculated dispersion times of virtual particles released both inside the model and within the wake. The particle distributions display three distinct dispersion behaviours, from nearly linear to a logarithmic decay slower than that of a solid cylinder, thus emphasising the existence of multiple flow regimes and the importance of the relative twine/mesh ratio. 11 page(s...|$|R
50|$|For a cricket net, the netting is {{the most}} {{important}} component. The net is usually manufactured in a synthetic polymer such as polyethylene, this is a hard wearing and relatively economic material. Prior to the mid-1990s nets were often made from nylon, however after the significant spikes in crude oil prices it was no longer viable to use nylon. The net will be black in colour or occasionally green. The mesh size of the net will be 50mm and will commonly have a twine diameter ranging from 1.8mm - 3.0mm. Cricket nets are supplied from a knotless or knotted netting - {{as a rule of thumb}} knotted nets are considered to be superior. It is important to understand that <b>twine</b> <b>thickness</b> of knotted and knotless nets are not directly comparable as breaking strengths of knotted nets are higher than knotless. A good standard cricket net will be UV stabilised and rot proof. For people who construct their own cricket cage, the netting is the only component which they need to purchase from a specialist supplier. Cricket netting is seamed at the edges to stop netting fraying. These seams are usually a 6mm cord sewn into the netting where it meets a cage or end. Canvas blinkers can be added to offer privacy and to reduce net wear. Also partial canvas skirts of 0.5m (at the lower portion of the netting) are added to prevent animal damage at night from creatures walking into netting and chewing out of it.|$|R

40|$|Physical {{models of}} fishing nets {{are used in}} fishing {{technology}} research at scales of 1 : 40 or smaller. As with all modelling involving fluid flow, {{a set of rules}} is required to determine the geometry of the model and its velocity relative to the water. Appropriate rules ensure that the model is subject to similar forces and behaves in a similar way to the full-scale net. It is not possible however, to choose a completely compatible set of modelling rules and a compromise is necessary. The common practice is to assume that similarity is achieved when a constant Froude Number is maintained. This is often found to be inadequate in that drag is increasingly overestimated as the scale is reduced. A new empirical relation between net drag coefficient and Reynolds Number at constant net geometry for one design of large mesh pelagic trawl is derived which applies over a wide range of Reynolds Numbers (based on mean <b>twine</b> <b>thickness)</b> from 63 to 1. 67 x 104. Six sizes of the same net design from full-scale to 1 : 40 were investigated. From this relation a new velocity scale relation has been proposed which relates velocity scale to linear scale for this particular trawl design. It is argued that not only the net mouth but also all the individual netting panels will maintain the correct geometry over this range of model sizes. The traditional Froude similarity law states that the velocity scale is equal to the linear scale to the power of 0. 5. The new relation suggests a power of approximately 0. 6. Lower velocities may be necessary to compensate for the increase in drag coefficient as Reynolds Number decreases at constant Froude Number. Until more experiments are done on radically different net designs it will not be possible to assess how widely this new relation may apply...|$|R
40|$|Trap gear such as {{set nets}} and pots are usually {{operated}} to fix {{on the sea}} bottom for several weeks. In order to be clear function changes in trap gear frameworks of this thesis were consisted of the following three steps by fishing gear constructions. 1) The netting twines consisted of the fundamental part of a fishing gear may be changed the breaking strength and elongation. 2) The nettings consisted of the minimum unit of function of capture. 3) Pot fishing gears are considered to the simplest model of an actual fishing gear. On the other hand, {{it is important for}} establishing and carrying out of environment-friendly to improve the fishing technology. In fact, trap gear are well-known as never-overfishing gear. It has never studied to be clear the function changes in trap gear during operations. In the present study, the function changes in trap gear were studied with using material engineering and hydrodynamical methods. The results obtaind can be summarized as follows: 1. The breaking strength and elongation of netting twines after soaked in the sea more than three years were measured. Nylon and polyethylene netting <b>twines</b> having <b>thickness</b> of 220 - 1980 denier were used. The breaking strength and elongation were sharply decreased for the first 1 year after soaked in the sea, and became a constant during 2 - 3 years. The retained breaking strength and elongation after 3 years of all test netting twines were about 70 % and 40 - 60 %, respectivly. 2. An encrusted condition of marine foulings on nettings for set nets which consider influence to measure a drag on the fouled plane netting by marine foulings were measured. The test netings were soaked around a set net fishing ground during the periods from 15 to 60 days and some water depthes (1. 5 to 15 m). The test netting consisted of polyester multi-filaments (0. 85 mm in diameter and 17 mm in bar length), which is commonly used for the set net fishing gear. The main marine foulings are fine attaching materials so-called "Nuta", Amphipoda, a kind of hydrozoans Tubulalia mesembryanthemum and a kind of moss animals Bugula neritina. 3. The drag per 1 m² for each test net at the right attack angle and 0. 5 m/s in flow velocity was from 3. 7 kgw to 19. 3 kgw. The changing ratio of drag varied from 1. 4 times to 8. 5 times against the initial (unused) netting. The mean ratio of drag on each soaking period, however, peaked 6. 5 times of the 30 th day net and then it scarcely changed till 60 th day net. 3. The drag per 1 m 2 for each test net at the right attack angle and 0. 5 m/s in flow velocity was from 3. 7 kgw to 19. 3 kgw. The changing raito of the drag varied from 1. 4 times to 8. 5 times against the unused net. However, the mean raito og drag on each soaking period peaked 6. 5 times of 30 days in soaking periods and then it scarcely changed till 60 days. The porosity (β) of the nettings before and after fouling changed from 76 to 16 %. The drag coefficient (CD) of fouled nettings can be expressed by the following equation; CD= 35. 98 (Rh) ⁻⁰. ⁴³(1. 7 × 10 ²<Rh< 1. 8 × 10 ³), where Rh is Reynolds number based on hydraulic mean depth of a fouled netting. However, the drag coefficient may be rather influenced the porosity for Rh< 5 × 10 ². The drag coefficient (CD) of a fouled netting was determined to be 1. 3 at 0. 6 <β< 0. 8 and 2. 2 atβ< 0. 5, respectively. The results suggest that the drag coefficient of a fouled netting is determined by its porosity. 4. To evaluate the preferable fishing ground for cuttlefish basket traps from bottom condition and CPUE (kg/trap/day) at two different fishing grounds (off Ariake and off Fukae) in Shimabara sound. The Md φ of off Ariake and off Fukae weres - 0. 3 to 3. 0 and 1. 0 to 1. 5, which were limited range against the whole Shimabara Sound (- 5. 4 to 5. 6). CPUE of off Fukae was 2 -fold greater than that of off Ariake. The significance of differences in CPUE between two fishing grounds was verified by taken together Mann-Whitney test (p< 0. 05). The results suggest that the medium sandy se﻿a bottom is more preferable for capturing of golden cuttlefish by the cuttlefish basket trap. 5. Catches were high at water temperature between 12 - 14 ℃. Daily catches varied periodically due to the change in the lunar cycle, and it became maximum at neap tide, or ebb, and minimum at spring tide. In this region, water temperature seems to be an important long-term factor affecting the main fishing period, and tidal current seems to be an important short-term factor controlling daily catch. The amount of catch might be controlled by both water temperature and tidal current, which is therefore the important factors in the cuttlefish basket trap fishery...|$|R
