40|$|Background: Following {{internal}} fixation of intertrochanteric hip fractures, tip <b>apex</b> <b>distance,</b> fracture classification, {{position of}} the screw in the femoral head, and fracture reduction are known predictors for screw cutout, but {{the reliability of the}}se measurements is unknown. We investigated the reliability of the tip <b>apex</b> <b>distance</b> measurement, the Cleveland femoral head dividing system, the three-grade classification system of Baumgaertner for fracture reduction, and the AO classification system as predictors for screw cutout. Methods: All patients with an intertrochanteric hip fracture who were managed with either a dynamic hip screw or a gamma nail between January 2007 and June 2010 were evaluated from our hip trauma database. Results: The tip <b>apex</b> <b>distance</b> measurement was reliable and patients with device cutout had a significantly higher tip <b>apex</b> <b>distance.</b> The agreement between observers with regard to screw position and fracture reduction was moderately reliable. After adjustment for tip <b>apex</b> <b>distance</b> and screw position, A 3 fractures were at more risk of cutout compared with A 1 fractures. Poor fracture reduction was significantly related with a higher incidence of cutout in univariate analysis, but not in multivariate analysis. Central-inferior and anterior-inferior positions, after adjustment for tip <b>apex</b> <b>distance</b> and screw position, were significantly protective against cutout. Conclusion: To decrease probable risks of cutout, the tip <b>apex</b> <b>distance</b> needs to stay small or the screw needs to be placed central-inferiorly or anterior-inferiorly.

Implants used for fixa-tion of femoral neck fractures can lead to unwanted outcomes in some patients.

Until now, there have been two methods published which quantify lag screw position within the femoral head.

40|$|Fractured neck {{of femur}} {{is a common}} problem seen in elderly {{osteoporotic}} females, mostly in Western countries, among which are the extra-capsular fractures such as intertrochanteric and pertrochanteric fractures also known as peritrochanteric fractures, and commonly treated with dynamic hip screw (DHS) or compression hip screw (CHS). The DHS is based on tension band principle and allows the screw to slide within the barrel to enable compression of the fracture when the patient begins to bear weight. This principle only works {{in the presence of}} intact medial wall and so cannot be successful in a reverse oblique fracture of the proximal femur. However, {{it is important that the}} technique of screw placement is precise and should ideally be central in the femoral neck, on both AP and lateral radiographs. This is why the concept of tip <b>apex</b> <b>distance</b> (TAD) is critical to the outcome of fixation and can accurately predict failure or survival of the screw. A systematic review of articles published in PubMed/Medline, from 1991 to 2011 (twenty years), was carried out to critically analyse common practice with regards to DHS fixation of extra-capsular femoral neck fractures, and review the recommendations of previous authors, with regard to the effect of TAD in DHS fixation. Search words used include TAD, DHS, sliding hip screw, femoral neck fractures, peritrochanteric fractures, tension band principle, fracture collapse, screw cut-out, DHS failure, and failure of fixation. At the end of the review, recommendations and suggestions regarding the ideal techniques of placement of DHS screw into the femoral neck will be made in line with current published literature, in order to establish an evidence base for best practice. A total of forty eight (48) published articles were found relevant to the review topic. Most papers suggested that Tip <b>Apex</b> <b>Distance</b> (TAD) is the most important predictive factor for DHS failure, followed by lag screw position, fracture pattern and reduction, patient′s age and presence of osteoporosis. Therefore, we recommend proper training of surgeons, as well as attention to detail while performing DHS for intertrochanteric neck of femur fractures...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} {{of gas and}} dust distributions following a spatially and temporally localized comet outburst was calculated using a hybrid kinetic-hydrodynamic method. In the inner coma the time-dependent continuity, momentum, and energy equations of the dusty gas flow were solved simultaneously using 12 dust sizes. Beyond 300 km a three-dimensional kinetic model was used to calculate the trajectory of each individual dust grain. It was found that following the onset of the comet outburst a gas-dust blast wave propagates outward in the inner coma. About 15 minutes after the increased gas and dust production was initiated at the nucleus, a new equilibrium was reached in the inner coma. The most important feature of this new steady state was the significant increase of the dust terminal velocities. These higher terminal velocity values resulted in larger <b>apex</b> <b>distances</b> for dust particles emitted during the outburst. The dust particles spend a relatively long time near their apex points; therefore, the outburst generates long-lasting distinct dust envelopes in front of the regular dust coma...|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} medico-legal reports regarding age estimation {{on the basis of}} oral cavities, but none on the relationship between alveolar process resorption and age. The author took 600 X-ray photos (males 300, females 300, aged 20 - 99 years) of each proximal alveolar process except for wisdom teeth. A straight line between the mesial cervical point and the distal cervical point, was made on each photograph. A line of falseness, parallel to the first line and the tooth root apex, was set up. The distance (A) from the cervical line (cement-enamel junction, CEJ), the distance (B) from the deepest point that the alveolar process is absorbing, to the tooth root apex from the falseness line was measured, and the index of the alveolar process resorption for each region was calculated by the following formula : Index of the alveolar process resorption = the deepest point of the alveolar process-root <b>apex</b> <b>distance</b> (B) × 100 /CEJ -root <b>apex</b> <b>distance</b> (A). There was a tendency for the index of the alveolar process resorption to decrease with increasing age, and {{it was found that the}} index and age were negatively correlative (coefficient of correlation r = - 0. 909 ～ - 0. 982, P＜ 0. 001) both in the anterior and posterior groups of both jaws. The following formulae were established : All teeth examined group, Y = - 1. 84 X + 19194 (± 4. 06 years); Upper anterior teeth group, Y = - 2. 17 X + 222. 89 (± 4. 03 years); Upper molar teeth group, Y = - 1. 82 X + 188. 41 (± 4. 56 years); Lower anterior teeth group, Y= - 1. 60 X + 173. 49 (± 3. 48 years); Upper molar teeth group, Y= - 1. 77 X + 182. 95 (± 4. 11 years) where Y = estimated age, and X = the average of the indicies of alveolar process resorption in each group. The age estimation equations showed accuracies of 82. 9 % or more for the age range of ± 5 years, and 99. 1 % for ± 7 years in the all teeth examined group.

A total number of 282 mandibular premolars were examined. Exclusion criteria comprised root caries, extensive restorations and endodontically treated teeth. The teeth were fixed and digitally radiographed by means of a specially developed fixation device with standardized and reproducible distances with the parallel technique (Heliodent MD; Merlin 2. 1). The distances from the CEJ to the first curvature (> 5 °) (distance I), from the first curvature to a second curvature (distance II), and from the first or second curvature to the radiological <b>apex</b> (<b>distance</b> III) were recorded. The lengths of the initial straight distance and the appearance of a curvature were statistically analyzed and related to each other. In first mandibular premolars, the mean value for distance I was 10. 9 mm, for distance II 3. 7 mm and for distance III 3. 04 mm. The mean values for the second mandibular premolars were 1. 1 mm in distance I, 4. 3 mm in distance II and 3. 1 mm in distance III. No statistically significant differences between left and right mandibular premolars could be observed regarding the canal curvature location and the angle values. The results of this investigation show that curvatures are increasingly observed 9 to 12 mm from the original path in mandibular premolars. </p...|$|E

Materials and Methods: Eight pairs of human cadaveric femurs were used; in one group [center-center (C-C) group], the helical blade of PFNA was fixed randomly in central position both in anteroposterior and lateral view, whereas in the other group it was fixed in inferior one-third position in anteroposterior and in central position in lateral view [inferior-center (I-C) group]. Unstable intertrochanteric fracture was created and each specimen was loaded cyclically till load to failure Results: Angular and rotational displacements were significantly higher within the C-C group compared to the I-C group in both unloaded and loaded condition. Loading to failure was higher in the I-C group compared to the C-C group. No statistical significance was found for this parameter. Correlations between tip <b>apex</b> <b>distance,</b> cyclic loading which lead to femoral head displacement, and ultimate load to failure showed a significant positive relationship. Conclusion: The I-C group was superior to the C-C group and provided better biomechanical stability for angular and rotational displacement. This study would be a stimulus for further experimental studies with larger number specimens and complex loading protocols at multicentres...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Intertrochantric {{fracture}} {{treatment is}} one of the orthopedic problems in the elderly. Especially in unstable fractures and patients with osteoporosis the outcome of treatment is not satisfactory. This study introduces criterion which might be effective in the prognosis of the treatment. Methods: Between 2002 - 2007, 128 patients with unstable intertrochantric fracture who had a severe osteoporosis in terms of sigh’s criterion (grade 1 - 3) and were treated with DHS and had a Tip <b>Apex</b> <b>Distance</b> (TAD) below 25 mm were followed up. In this patient Y/B (diameter of femoral neck/diameter of body of nail) and X/A (great diameter of femoral head/ diameter of pitch of nail) were calculated and failure of treatment was evaluated in different groups. Results: The total amount of treatment failure was 33 (26 %). the average age of patients was 74. 4 years old. 86 patients were female and 42 of them were male. The greatest failure rate was seen in B 1 group (21 cases) with Y/B≥ 3. 6 mm and in B 2 group (23 cases) with X/A≥ 3 mm. The mean of Y/B and X/A were 3. 64 and 3. 08 millimeters, respectively. Conclusion: Noting the high incidence of treatment failure especially in B 1 and B 2 groups which shows great incidence of the treatment failure in patients with large femoral neck and head diameter, new treatment measures should be taken to improve the treatment prognosis of unstable intertrochantric fractures especially in patients with large femoral neck and head diamete...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} roentgenographic in vitro study was to {{determine}} the initial straight length from the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) to the appearance of a root canal curvature in human mandibular pre-molars. A total number of 282 mandibular premolars were examined. Exclusion criteria comprised root caries, extensive restorations and endodontically treat-ed teeth. The teeth were fixed and digitally radi-ographed by means of a specially developed fixation device with standardized and reproducible distances with the parallel technique (Heliodent MD; Merlin 2. 1). The distances from the CEJ to the first curvature (> 5 °) (distance I), from the first curvature to a second curvature (distance II), and from the first or second curvature to the radiological <b>apex</b> (<b>distance</b> III) were recorded. The lengths of the initial straight distance and the appearance of a curvature were statistically an-alyzed and related to each other. In first mandibular premolars, the mean value for distance I was 10. 9 mm, for distance II 3. 7 mm and for distance III 3. 04 mm. The mean values for the second mandibular premolars were 1. 1 mm in distance I, 4. 3 mm in distance II and 3. 1 mm in distance III. No statistically significant dif-ferences between left and right mandibular premolars could be observed regarding the canal curvature loca-tion and the angle values. The results of this investiga-tion show that curvatures are increasingly observed 9 to 12 mm from the original path in mandibular pre-molars.

40|$|The title {{compound}} (1) {{is obtained}} by mixing aqueous 2 -aminoethanol solutions of theophylline and copper(II) salt. According {{to the single}} crystal data the CU 2 + ion is pentacoordinated and located in a slightly distorted square pyramidal configuration. Four short Cu-N bonds to two N(7) of the theophyllinate anions and to two nitrogen atoms of a monodentate and a bidentate 2 -aminoethanol ligands are almost in the plane, while a longer Cu-O bond to oxygen of the bidentate 2 -aminoethanol in the <b>apex</b> at <b>distance</b> 2. 350 (8) Angstrom A. When heated in air or in an inert atmosphere, 1 undergoes a five-step decomposition process studied by TG, DSC and evolved gas detection (EGD). The solid intermediates of the thermal decomposition were detected by FTIR and powder X-ray diffraction. First the water molecules then the mono-and bidentate 2 -aminoethanol ligands are released {{in the order of}} their binding energy, showing a strong structure-stability correlation. Afterwards chemical degradation of theophyllinato ligands occurs and is accompanied in air by an intense oxidation process resulting in CuO formation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
