After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> mirth at the reunion, Orion shows up, seeking Sylvia. He and Aminta fight; Sylvia {{barricades}} herself in Diana's shrine and Orion attempts to follow. The goddess of the hunt, outraged at this act, smites Orion and denies Aminta and Sylvia congress. Compassionate Eros gives Diana a vision. The goddess reminisces over her own young love of Endymion, also a shepherd. Diana has {{a change of heart}} and repeals her decree. Aminta and Sylvia come together under the deities' good will.|$|E

When the Change Projector is destroyed, the device controlling his brain is disabled, giving him <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> humanity during which he recites a small poem in English and tells Gold-Eye that he was once Sam Allen; after this, he falls into the water and dies due to the lack of Projector radiation energy.|$|E
25|$|The second {{effect of}} {{weightlessness}} {{takes place in}} human fluids. The body {{is made up of}} 60% water, much of it intra-vascular and inter-cellular. Within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> entering a microgravity environment, fluid is immediately re-distributed to the upper body resulting in bulging neck veins, puffy face and sinus and nasal congestion which can last throughout the duration of the trip and is very much like the symptoms of the common cold. In space the autonomic reactions of the body to maintain blood pressure are not required and fluid is distributed more widely around the whole body. This results in a decrease in plasma volume of around 20%. These fluid shifts initiate a cascade of adaptive systemic effects that can be dangerous upon return to earth. Orthostatic intolerance results in astronauts returning to Earth after extended space missions being unable to stand unassisted for more than 10 minutes at a time without fainting. This {{is due in part to}} changes in the autonomic regulation of blood pressure and the loss of plasma volume. Although this effect becomes worse the longer the time spent in space, as yet all individuals have returned to normal within at most a few weeks of landing.|$|E

A less common variety occurs where the color change is to deep violet rather than blue. The bluing reaction results from the oxidation of a chemical called gyrocyanin.|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang of Variety {{said the}} film [...] "succeeds well enough as a genial {{diversion}} {{and sometimes a}} delightful one, predicated on the rarely heeded Hollywood wisdom that less really can be more." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter remarked, [...] "Although the story dynamics are fundamentally silly and the family stuff, with its parallel father-daughter melodrama, is elemental button-pushing, a good cast led by a winning Paul Rudd puts the nonsense over in reasonably disarming fashion." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Playful in unexpected ways and graced with a genuinely off-center sense of humor, Ant-Man (engagingly directed by Peyton Reed) is light on its feet the way the standard-issue Marvel behemoths never are." [...] Kim Newman of Empire wrote that it [...] "straddles as many genres as the Avengers films have characters but manages to do most of them pretty well. Extremely likable, with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> proper wonder." [...] A. O.

500|$|The Strawberry Panic! {{short stories}} were {{initially}} panned by Erica Friedman as being [...] "distinctly derivative of Maria-sama ga Miteru". Friedman {{is the president}} of Yuricon, an anime convention geared towards fans of yuri anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to yuri. Friedman described the stories as, [...] "candy apples without the apples - all sugary, and gooey and sweet, with not much of anything else to support it". After initially having this stance for the entire series, including an early opinion on the anime version, Friedman later changed her opinion slightly, writing that [...] " [...] turned out pretty good". She went on to say, [...] "There's no denying that Strawberry Panic! wasn't brilliant, but considering that {{it was meant to be}} trashy, it pulled out <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> dignity and elegance out of the trash heap." [...] Jason Thompson regarded the Strawberry Panic! manga as [...] "a nearly plotless cascade [...] everything seems rushed, and it is difficult to keep track of the characters and plot." ...|$|E

She also performed the song at the Billboard Women in Music event on December 11, 2015, where she was presented with the award for Woman of the Year. The song was also performed at an intimate gathering at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills. The audience consisted of the filmmakers and the rape survivors featured in the documentary. Gaga reportedly became emotional while performing the song, and thanked the filmmakers for including the song in the film. She also performed the song at the 2015 Producers Guild of America Awards, where The Hunting Ground was awarded a special recognition trophy. Actress America Ferrera introduced Gaga but she did not appear on stage for sometime leading to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> [...] "nervous laughter from the audience" [...] as Ferrera tried to joke about the situation, until the singer finally arrived in front of her piano on stage.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} airing on March 15, 2009, [...] "The Juice is Loose" [...] was watched by 7.21 million households and acquired a 3.6 rating in the 18–49 demographic. It was the most-watched {{show in the}} [...] "Animation Domination" [...] block, surpassing The Simpsons, American Dad! and King of the Hill. The episode received mixed reviews from television sources and critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave [...] "The Juice Is Loose" [...] 5.5/10, saying that the episode was [...] "a largely forgettable episode with only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> brilliance". The review criticized the usage of a three-minute long Conway Twitty live action singing clip which was received as an [...] "effort {{to reduce the amount}} of animation... for the episode". Alex Rocha of TV Guide said that he [...] "did enjoy this episode" [...] but called the Conway Twitty clip a [...] "filler" [...] and that he would have wanted to see a [...] "blank screen or even commercials" [...] instead. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club stated that the episode [...] "relied on an overabundance of pop culture riffs far too dated to elicit much more than a brief chuckle", and also criticized the Conway Twitty clip. He graded [...] "The Juice Is Loose" [...] a C+.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{a positive response}} from reviewers. They disagreed over how well Paltrow was used, but generally praised the Brittany–Santana and Kurt–Burt storylines. The Atlantic Kevin Fallon deemed [...] "Sexy" [...] an episode of mixed messages, one which treated the issues it raised with [...] "an appropriate amount of levity", but failed to [...] "play the nuances of the [...] argument as delicately as it probably thought it did." [...] His Atlantic co-writer Patrick Burns criticized the series for glorifying a risqué subject, [...] "then half-heartedly attempt to hammer home a moral." [...] Meghan Brown, also writing for The Atlantic, called it a [...] "solid episode with some strong character moments." [...] Time James Poniewozik felt that the episode [...] "began clumsily, lacked subtlety, involved some embarrassing moments" [...] and focused too much on Paltrow, but as it continued, [...] "achieve <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> delight and honest emotion". Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times described it as [...] "incredibly comprehensive and enjoyable to boot", and IGN Robert Canning said it [...] "avoided preaching and teaching and instead just had some fun and let guest star Gwyneth Paltrow steal all the scenes". Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Glee continues its climb, delicately and successfully marrying actual sex lessons with camp and humor".|$|E
500|$|Late in the afternoon, {{after hours}} of fighting, Wilson's men ran out of ammunition, and reacted to this by rising to their feet, shaking each other's hands and singing a song, {{possibly}} [...] "God Save the Queen". The Matabele downed their own rifles and ended the battle charging with assegai spears. Some of the whites allegedly used their last bullets to commit suicide. According to an eyewitness, [...] "the white inDuna" [...] (Wilson) {{was the last to}} die, standing motionless before the Matabele with blood streaming from wounds all over his body. After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> hesitation, a young warrior ran forward and killed him with his assegai. The Matabele usually mutilated the bodies of their foes after a victory, but on this occasion they did not: [...] "The white men died so bravely we would not treat them as we do the cowardly Mashonas and others," [...] an inDuna explained. At Mjaan's orders, the bodies of the patrol were left untouched, though the whites' clothes and two of their facial skins were collected the next morning to serve as proof to Lobengula of the battle's outcome. [...] "I had two sons killed that day," [...] Ingubo warrior M'Kotchwana later said, [...] "and my brother was shot in the stomach. The amakiwa [...] were brave men; they were warriors." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian Gareth McLean {{described}} the episode as a [...] "bold move" [...] {{on the part}} of the EastEnders producers in deviating from the serial's usual format, and found it to be [...] "compelling and brave", but [...] "not as convincing as it should be". The Daily Telegraph Gerard O'Donovan felt that Brown gave a [...] "mesmerising" [...] performance, but was critical of the episode as a whole, concluding: [...] "Overall [...] the feeling couldn't be avoided that in the greater scheme of things this was a fuss over nothing. Had it been a swan song, it would have been a worthy one. But doubtless Dot will be out and about again tonight, fag in hand, quoting from the Good Book. Enjoyable as this Albert Square indulgence was, I suspect that most fans will be hoping this one-hander remains a one-off." [...] Leigh Holmwood for The Guardian suggested that viewers may have agreed with O'Donovan's assessment, highlighting the fact that the episode received only 8.7million viewers, compared to 9.4million watching EastEnders the previous week. O'Donovan compared the episode to Krapp's Last Tape, saying [...] "it must be said there were quite <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> positively (or perhaps that should be negatively) Beckettian bleakness here as Dot recalled, in painfully vivid detail, how time and time again 'life took away everything I ever cared about' and 'all that I ever 'ad, I lorst'." ...|$|E

500|$|Love's Last Shift {{can be seen}} as {{an early}} sign of Cibber's {{sensitivity}} to shifts of public opinion, which was to be useful to him in his later career as manager at Drury Lane (see Colley Cibber). In the 1690s, the economic and political power balance of the nation tilted from the aristocracy towards the middle class after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and middle-class values of religion, morality, and gender roles became more dominant, not least in attitudes to the stage. Love's Last Shift {{is one of the first}} illustrations of a massive shift in audience taste, away from the analytic bent and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy. The play illustrates Cibber's opportunism at a moment in time before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something into his first play to please every section of the audience, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness. The way Vanbrugh, in his turn, allows the reformed rake to relapse quite cheerfully, and has the only preaching in the play come from the comically corrupt parson of [...] "Fatgoose Living", has made some early 20th-century critics refer to The Relapse as the last of the true Restoration comedies. However, Vanbrugh's play is also affected by the taste of the 1690s, and compared to a play like the courtier William Wycherley's The Country Wife of 20 years earlier, with its celebration of predatory aristocratic masculinity, The Relapse contains quite <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> morality and uplift. In fact it has a kind of parallel structure to Love's Last Shift: in the climactic scene of Cibber's play, Amanda's virtue reforms her husband, and in the corresponding scene of The Relapse, it reforms her admirer Worthy. Such moments have not done the play any favours with modern critics.|$|E
