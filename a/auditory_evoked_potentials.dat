25|$|Recent {{advances}} {{have led to}} the manufacture of monitors of awareness. Typically these monitor the EEG, which represents the electrical activity of the cerebral cortex, which is active when awake but quiescent when anesthetized (or in natural sleep). The monitors usually process the EEG signal down to a single number, where 100 corresponds to a patient who is fully alert, and zero corresponds to electrical silence. General anesthesia is usually signified by a number between 60 and 40 (this varies with the specific system used). There are several monitors now commercially available. These newer technologies include the bispectral index (BIS), EEG entropy monitoring, <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials,</b> and several other systems such as the SNAP monitor and the Narcotrend monitor.|$|E

Methods: After ethics committee approval, 42 patients were allocated to four groups. Baseline measurements were performed after implementing a calculated steady state anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. The control group received no additional medication. The ketamine group received a bolus and continuous infusion of ketamine. The rocuronium group received a bolus of rocuronium. The rocuronium-ketamine group received both. All data were stored during 15 min after baseline. After inspection of the raw data, the authors conducted an explorative statistical analysis. Results: No significant changes {{were found in the}} control group for any of the monitors.

40|$|Background and Aim: Learning disability(LD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} problems among elementary school children. Approximately 10 percent of all elementary school children suffer from this problem. It has been determined that learning disability is predominantly accompanied with subtle impairment in central auditory nervous system. The main idea of this study was to evaluate middle latency <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> (MLAEPs) in learning disabled children. Materials and Method: This cross-sectional study investigated middle latency <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> in children with learning disability (n = 31) compared to normal children (n = 31). Latencies and amplitudes of MLAEPs results with different stimulus intensity and binaural stimulation were compared between two groups.

40|$|We {{recruited}} 128 neonates with hyperbilirubinemia over a 5 -year period (1995 - 2000) {{to study}} the short- and long-term effects of hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia on the auditory brainstem pathway and neurodevelopmental status. These children {{were divided into two}} groups: (1) a hemolytic group (n = 29; ABO incompatibility [n = 19], Rh incompatibility [n = 1], glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [n = 8] and both ABO incompatibility and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [n = 1]) and (2) a nonhemolytic group (n = 99). All received phototherapy. Exchange transfusions were performed for four (13. 8 %) in the hemolytic group and three (3 %) in the nonhemolytic group. The brainstem <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> was recorded at a mean age of 3. 2 months in the hemolytic group and 3. 1 months in the nonhemolytic group. Serial brainstem <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> assessments were performed until 2 years of age (3 in the hemolytic group and 18 in the nonhemolytic group). All had regular physical, neurologic, visual, and auditory evaluation until 3 years of age. The rate of exchange transfusion was significantly higher in the hemolytic group than in the nonhemolytic group (P <. 05). Brainstem <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> abnormalities at the initial assessment occurred in three (10. 4 %) in the hemolytic group (all related to ABO incompatibility) and nine (9. 1 %) in the nonhemolytic group. At 2 years, the brainstem <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> returned to normal except in three cases with a slightly increased hearing threshold (one [3. 5 %] in the hemolytic group at 60 dB nHL and two [2 %] in the nonhemolytic group at 50 dB nHL]). There {{were no significant differences in}} the rate of brainstem <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> abnormalities at the initial or subsequent assessments between both groups. All except five cases had a normal neurodevelopmental outcome at 3 years (three [two with ABO incompatibility and one with glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency] in the hemolytic group [10. 4 %] and two [2 %] in the nonhemolytic group). All had mild motor delay and hypotonia, which returned to normal at 3 years. The rate of abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome was higher in the hemolytic group than in the nonhemolytic group, although with no significant difference between both groups (P =. 08). All five cases in both groups with abnormal neurodevelopment had a normal brainstem <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> at the initial assessment. There was no relationship between the abnormal initial brainstem <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> and the final neurodevelopmental outcome. The toxic effect of hyperbilirubinemia on the auditory brainstem pathway and neurodevelopmental status in our cohort was transient. The prognosis of neonatal hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia in our Chinese cohort is excellent, possibly owing to an aggressive early-intervention approach. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: caracterizar o potencial evocado auditivo de tronco encefálico e de longa latência em pacientes pós traumatismo cranioencefálico, comparando-os com indivíduos normais. MÉTODO: estudo clínico {{transversal}} realizado com 20 indivíduos audiologicamente normais divididos em dois grupos pareados por idade e sexo: a) 10 indivíduos que sofreram traumatismo cranioencefálico (grupo pesquisa); b) 10 indivíduos sem qualquer tipo de alteração neurológica (grupo controle). Foram submetidos à avaliação audiológica básica, ao potencial evocado auditivo de tronco encefálico e ao potencial evocado auditivo de longa latência (P 300). RESULTADOS: observou-se no potencial evocado auditivo de tronco encefálico, latências absolutas das ondas I, III e V e intervalo interpico I-III mais prolongados no grupo pesquisa do que no grupo controle, sendo estatisticamente significante para as latências absolutas das ondas I e III à direita e para a onda III e intervalo interpico I-III à esquerda. A amplitude das ondas I, III e V na orelha direita e das ondas III e V na orelha esquerda foram maiores no grupo controle. Em relação ao P 300, o grupo pesquisa apresentou maior latência e menor amplitude em ambas as orelhas, sem significância estatística, quando comparado ao grupo controle. CONCLUSÃO: indivíduos que sofreram traumatismo cranioencefálico apresentam alterações no potencial evocado auditivo de tronco encefálico e não apresentam diferenças significantes no potencial evocado auditivo de longa latência (P 300) quando comparados a indivíduos sem lesões cerebrais. PURPOSE: {{this study}} aimed to characterize brain stem <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> and long latency <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> in patients that suffered head trauma.

40|$|INTRODUCTION:: Intraoperative {{monitoring}} of brain stem <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> during microvascular decompression (MVD) prevent hearing loss (HL). Previous {{studies have shown}} that changes in wave III (wIII) are an early and sensitive sign of auditory nerve injury. OBJECTIVE:: To evaluate the changes of amplitude and latency of wIII of brain stem <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> during MVD and its association with postoperative HL. Hearing loss was classified by American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) criteria, based on changes in pure tone audiometry and speech discrimination score. METHODS:: Retrospective analysis of wIII in patients who underwent intraoperative monitoring with brain stem <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> during MVD was performed. A univariate logistic regression analysis was performed on independent variables amplitude of wIII and latency of wIII at change max and On-Skin, or a final recording at the time of skin closure. A further analysis for the same variables was performed adjusting for the loss of wave. RESULTS:: The latency of wIII was not found to be significantly different between groups I and II. The amplitude of wIII was significantly decreased in the group with HL. Regression analysis did not find any increased odds of HL with changes in the amplitude of wIII. CONCLUSIONS:: Changes in wave III did not increase the odds of HL in patients who underwent brain stem <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> s during MVD. This information might be valuable to evaluate the value of wIII as an alarm criterion during MVD to prevent HL. © 2014 by the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society...|$|R

40|$|M. A. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} whether <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> distinguishes between motor coordinated and-uncoordinated African children. Because the brain functions as a unified entity and different brain systems are integrated simultaneously, it was postulated that there is a relationship between the <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> of the brain stem on the one hand and motor coordination on the other hand, that is, the sensory and the motor systems are related. Sensory- motor activity is thus perceived to form a unified function within the total framework of human functioning. The relevant literature points to a possible relationship between the <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> of the brain stem and motor coordination. Patients with degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis exhibit abnormal <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> responses as well as unusual motor behaviour and coordination. Similarly, children with hearing problems also show unusual <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> responses of the brain stem as well as motor lethargy(delayed motor responses) and clumsiness. As a result of these tendencies it was postulated that <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> would be able to distinguish between motor-coordinated and -uncoordinated subjects. The brain's <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> response is a robust phenomenon that provides a record of electrical brain activity, even in trials where overt responses are not usually expected. The present study focuses on the <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> of the brain stem (AEP). The <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> serves as a measure of the sensory transmission of information in the brain and consequently highlights the neural activity underlying normal sensory experiences. The subjects selected for the study were 46 eight- to twelve-year-old African children attending a farm school. They can be regarded as representative of the population of eight- to twelve-year old African farm children. All the subjects were administered the Quick Neurological Screening Test in order to catagorise them into two groups, namely the motor-coordinated group and the motor-uncoordinated group.
