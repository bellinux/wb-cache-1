5|$|The {{attachment}} theory {{focused on}} {{the attention of the}} child when the mother is there and the responses that the child shows when the mother leaves, which indicated the <b>attachment</b> <b>and</b> bonding of the mother and the child.

5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious <b>attachment</b> <b>and</b> another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
5|$|Four {{different}} attachment classifications {{have been}} identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant <b>attachment,</b> <b>and</b> disorganized attachment. Secure attachment is when children feel they can rely on their caregivers to attend to their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to be the best attachment style. Anxious-ambivalent attachment is when the infant feels separation anxiety when separated from the caregiver and does not feel reassured when the caregiver returns to the infant. Anxious-avoidant attachment is when the infant avoids their parents. Disorganized attachment is when {{there is a lack of}} attachment behavior.|$|E
5|$|In Suicide (1897), Durkheim {{explores the}} differing suicide rates among Protestants and Catholics, arguing that {{stronger}} social control among Catholics results in lower suicide rates. According to Durkheim, Catholic society has normal levels of integration while Protestant society has low levels. Overall, Durkheim treated suicide {{as a social}} fact, explaining variations in its rate on a macro level, considering society-scale phenomena such as lack of connections between people (group <b>attachment)</b> <b>and</b> lack of regulations of behavior, rather than individuals' feelings and motivations.|$|E

5|$|Morchella populiphila is a {{distinct}} morel because of its cap <b>attachment</b> <b>and</b> its habitat, and {{it is unlikely to}} be mistaken for other species. Verpa bohemica is somewhat similar in appearance, but its cap hangs free from attachment to the stipe. The other North American half-free morel, Morchella punctipes, is very similar in appearance to M.populiphila, and they cannot be reliably distinguished on morphology alone. The distribution of M.punctipes extends from the Great Plains eastward. The widespread European species Morchella semilibera is morphologically indistinguishable from M.populiphila, in both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The gingiva ("gums") is the mucosal {{tissue that}} {{overlays}} the jaws. There are three {{different types of}} epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between the tooth and the mouth. The gingival epithelium is not associated directly with tooth <b>attachment</b> <b>and</b> is visible in the mouth. The junctional epithelium, composed of the basal lamina and hemidesmosomes, forms an attachment to the tooth. The sulcular epithelium is nonkeratinized stratified squamous tissue on the gingiva which touches but is not attached to the tooth.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether dependence and self-criticism are two mediators between <b>attachment</b> anxiety <b>and</b> avoidance and depression. Participants were 424 undergraduate students at a large Midwestern university. Data was analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results indicated that the relationship between <b>attachment</b> anxiety <b>and</b> depression was fully mediated by dependence and self-criticism while the relationship between <b>attachment</b> avoidance <b>and</b> depression was partially mediated by dependence and self-criticism. Moreover, about 49 % of the variance in dependence was explained by <b>attachment</b> anxiety <b>and</b> <b>attachment</b> avoidance, 27 % of the variance in self-criticism was explained by <b>attachment</b> anxiety <b>and</b> <b>attachment</b> avoidance, <b>and</b> 47 % of the variance in depression was explained by <b>attachment</b> avoidance, dependence, <b>and</b> self-criticism in the final structural model. These results provide valuable information for working with college students with higher levels of attachment anxiety to decrease their depression through managing their levels of dependence and self-criticism...|$|R

5|$|The {{interior}} {{surfaces of}} the arms are covered with circular, adhesive suckers. The suckers allow the octopus to anchor itself or to manipulate objects. Each sucker is usually circular and bowl-like and has two distinct parts: an outer shallow cavity called an infundibulum and a central hollow cavity called an acetabulum, {{both of which are}} thick muscles covered in a protective chitinous cuticle. When a sucker attaches to a surface, the orifice between the two structures is sealed. The infundibulum provides adhesion while the acetabulum remains free, and muscle contractions allow for <b>attachment</b> <b>and</b> detachment.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} measures of adult attachment, the most common being self-report questionnaires and coded interviews based on the Adult Attachment Interview. The various measures were developed primarily as research tools, for different purposes and addressing different domains, for example romantic relationships, parental relationships or peer relationships. Some classify an adult's state of mind with respect to <b>attachment</b> <b>and</b> attachment patterns by reference to childhood experiences, while others assess relationship behaviours and security regarding parents and peers.|$|E
5|$|There is {{one case}} study on maltreated twins {{published}} in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins {{between the ages of}} 19 and 36 months, during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements. The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of RAD, disorganized <b>attachment</b> <b>and</b> post traumatic stress disorder. The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that gender differences in attachment patterns of adaptive significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. Insecure <b>attachment</b> <b>and</b> early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they are in a very high risk environment. Adrenarche is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.|$|E
5|$|Children with RAD are {{presumed to}} have grossly {{disturbed}} internal working models of relationships {{that may lead}} to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, and {{there is a lack of}} clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years. However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the Cold War in the early-1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of <b>attachment</b> <b>and</b> led to efforts from the late-1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.|$|E
5|$|In 1860 Berkeley and Curtis {{described}} the species Agaricus cyanophos from material also {{collected from the}} Bonin Islands. This material was found near the location that the original specimens of M.chlorophos were found, {{but a couple of}} weeks later. Japanese mycologists Seiya Ito and Sanshi Imai studied these collections in the late 1930s, and concluded that Agaricus cyanophos was the same species as M.chlorophos, despite differences in cap shape, gill <b>attachment,</b> <b>and</b> the color of emitted light. Desjardin and colleagues agreed with this determination after examining the type material of both taxa. M.chlorophos is classified in the section Exornatae of the genus Mycena. Other luminescent species in this section are M.discobasis and M.marginata. Some authors have considered M.illuminans to be synonymous with M.chlorophos due to their morphological similarity, but molecular analysis has shown that they are distinct species.|$|E

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{examined}} the association between mindfulness <b>and</b> <b>attachment.</b> However, close inspection of these studies suggests that the strength of this association may differ based on participants' experience in mindfulness meditation. The aim of the present research was to examine a possible differential relationship between mindfulness <b>and</b> <b>attachment</b> in experienced <b>and</b> inexperienced mindfulness meditators. Results revealed that mindfulness <b>and</b> <b>attachment</b> were significantly related in both groups, but <b>attachment</b> anxiety <b>and</b> avoidance together accounted for more than twice the variance in mindfulness in experienced meditators compared with their inexperienced counterparts. The relationship between <b>attachment</b> anxiety <b>and</b> mindfulness was significantly stronger in the group of experienced meditators, such that this association was moderated by mindfulness meditation experience. This stronger association between <b>attachment</b> anxiety <b>and</b> mindfulness may reflect the beneficial effects of mindfulness training on both mindfulness <b>and</b> <b>attachment</b> anxiety <b>and</b> provides some evidence that mindfulness interventions may enhance secure attachment.
