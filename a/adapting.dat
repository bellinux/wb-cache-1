5|$|The Epistles are {{admired for}} the way that their poetry and music fit so well together. Bellman chose not to compose the tunes, instead {{borrowing}} and <b>adapting</b> existing melodies, most likely to exploit the humour of contrasting the associations of well-known tunes with the meanings he gave them. This {{may also have been}} intended to provide historical depth to his work; he sometimes devoted considerable energy to <b>adapting</b> melodies to fit an Epistle's needs.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} driving forces behind farmers’ {{decisions}} to <b>adapt</b> to climate change, {{and the impact}} of adaptation on farmers’ food production. We investigate whether there are differences in the food production functions of farm households that <b>adapted</b> and those that did not <b>adapt.</b> We estimate a simultaneous equations model with endogenous switching to account for the heterogeneity in the decision to <b>adapt</b> or not, and for unobservable characteristics of farmers and their farm. We compare the expected food production under the actual and counterfactual cases that the farm household <b>adapted</b> or not to climate change. We find that the group of farm households that <b>adapted</b> has systematically different characteristics than the group of farm households that did not <b>adapt.</b> The relationship between production and average temperature is inverted U-shaped for farm households that <b>adapted,</b> while it is U-shaped for farm households that did not <b>adapt,</b> and vice versa in the case of precipitation. We find that adaptation increases food production, however, the impact of adaptation on food production is smaller for the farm households that actually did <b>adapt</b> than for the farm households that did not <b>adapt</b> in the counterfactual case that they <b>adapted...</b>|$|R

5|$|A population's genetic {{variation}} can be greatly reduced by a bottleneck, and even beneficial adaptations may be permanently eliminated. The loss of variation leaves the surviving population vulnerable to any new selection pressures such as disease, climate change or {{shift in the}} available food source, because <b>adapting</b> in response to environmental changes requires sufficient {{genetic variation}} in the population for natural selection to take place.|$|E

They were later able to use these skills and relationships on Henson's next television venture, The Muppet Show.|$|E

Development of Ape Escape lasted over two years, and was generally focused on <b>adapting</b> {{to the use of the}} controller, which was a significant challenge for the development team.|$|E
