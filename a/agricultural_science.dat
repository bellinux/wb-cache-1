5|$|In {{his last}} year at Otago Boys High, McCaw was head boy, proxime accessit (runner up) to the dux and played in the school's {{starting}} XV. McCaw {{came to the attention}} of national selectors during a 5-all draw with Rotorua Boys' High School in the 1998 New Zealand secondary schools rugby final in Christchurch. However, he failed to make the New Zealand Secondary Schools Team, losing out to Sam Harding, Angus McDonald and Hale T-Pole. With Sam Harding moving south to study at the University of Otago, McCaw headed to Christchurch's Lincoln University to study <b>agricultural</b> <b>science</b> and pursue his rugby interests. He achieved all but two papers for his Bachelor of <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Science</b> degree before deciding to pursue his rugby career instead. He received an honorary doctorate on recognition of his sporting achievements in April 2012.|$|E

5|$|Arrington's father {{offered to}} pay for Arrington {{to serve as an}} LDS missionary, but not for a {{university}} education. Arrington did not serve an LDS mission, but considered his educational endeavors a form of church service. Under a scholarship to the University of Idaho, Arrington studied <b>agricultural</b> <b>science</b> in 1935, later changing to agricultural economics. George S. Tanner, the director of the LDS Institute at the University of Idaho, was a progressive intellectual Mormon who taught Arrington that Christianity and science could be compatible and that other translations of the Bible could assist in its interpretation. One of the university's newest economics professors, Erwin Graue, taught the ideas of Alfred Marshall and influenced Arrington to see economics as a study of human relationships and not just mathematical economic forces. Marshall wrote that religious fervor could influence people to act altruistically.|$|E
5|$|Soil is {{the living}} {{top layer of}} mineral and organic dirt that covers {{the surface of the}} planet. It is the chief {{organizing}} centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of critical importance in <b>agricultural</b> <b>science</b> and ecology. The decomposition of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing minerals and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the pedosphere where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the detritivores that regulate soil formation. Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called bioturbation. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil microorganisms are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils. Paleoecological studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other events, such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the Devonian period {{played a significant role in}} the early development of ecological trophism in soils.|$|E

40|$|Without question, {{racial and}} ethnic {{minority}} groups are playing more significant roles in American society. However, there still remains a lack of diversity within the STEM workforce, especially within <b>agricultural</b> <b>sciences</b> disciplines. More problematic {{is the fact that}} low numbers of African Americans are employed in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>sciences</b> workforce. This study extends the use of Social Cognitive Career Theory by exploring how person, contextual and cognitive factors interplay to influence the career goals and career exploratory behaviors of African American college students pursuing STEM-intensive <b>agricultural</b> <b>sciences</b> majors. Instruments were selected to measure various components of the SCCT framework, focusing primarily on person, cognitive and contextual variables. Data were collected from African American undergraduate students (N = 314) enrolled in STEM-intensive <b>agricultural</b> <b>sciences</b> majors at five Historically Black Land-Grant Institutions. A Structural Equation Modeling technique was utilized to test three research hypotheses. An additional research question was included to identify additional factors influencing students’ pursuit of STEM-intensive <b>agricultural</b> <b>sciences</b> majors. Overall, the structural models indicated good model fit with significant paths being identified among several of the SCCT variables. There are four conclusions of this study. First, African American college students who were enrolled in STEM-intensive <b>agricultural</b> <b>sciences</b> majors with masculine gender personality attributes are {{more likely to engage in}} career exploratory behaviors if they feel more confidence in making career decisions. Second, African American students who were enrolled in STEM-intensive <b>agricultural</b> <b>sciences</b> majors who faced career barriers were more likely to engage in career exploratory behaviors. Third, African American college students who were enrolled in STEM-intensive <b>agricultural</b> <b>sciences</b> majors who were confident in their ability in making career decisions and coping with career barriers were more likely to engage in more career exploratory behaviors. Fourth, African American college students who were enrolled in STEM-intensive <b>agricultural</b> <b>sciences</b> majors reported mentoring as the most helpful factor regarding their career pursuits, and academic difficulties as the most hindering factor regarding their career pursuits. Future directions for research are provided as well as implications for the theory, research and practice. ...|$|R
