5|$|Germany {{has been}} the home of many famous inventors and engineers, {{including}} Hans Geiger, {{the creator of the}} Geiger counter; and Konrad Zuse, who built the first fully automatic digital computer. Such German inventors, engineers and industrialists as Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, Otto Lilienthal, Gottlieb Daimler, Rudolf Diesel, Hugo Junkers and Karl Benz helped shape modern automotive and air transportation technology. German institutions like the German Aerospace Center (DLR) are the largest contributor to ESA. <b>Aerospace</b> <b>engineer</b> Wernher von Braun developed the first space rocket at Peenemünde and later on was a prominent member of NASA and developed the Saturn V Moon rocket. Heinrich Rudolf Hertz's work in the domain of electromagnetic radiation was pivotal to the development of modern telecommunication.|$|E
5|$|Bruce McLaren Motor Racing {{was founded}} in 1963; Bruce McLaren was a factory driver for the Cooper motor racing team which competed in Formula One, {{the highest level of}} {{international}} single-seater competition. For two years the McLaren team had raced in the Tasman Series, a competition for single-seaters that ran during the Formula One world championship off-season, and in various sports car races. Bruce McLaren continued to race in Grands Prix (i.e. Formula One championship races) for Cooper, but by 1965 the team's performances were worsening and so he decided to build his own Formula One car to race the following year. Despite being a skilled engineer himself, McLaren enlisted Robin Herd to design the car. Herd was an <b>aerospace</b> <b>engineer</b> who had previously worked at the National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE) where he had been involved with the Concorde project. In September 1965 the M2A development car was completed. Powered by a 4.5 litre Oldsmobile V8 engine, it was used to test Herd's design ideas and Firestone's tyres. With McLaren still employed by Cooper, the McLaren team initially denied that they were building a Formula One competitor, claiming that the M2A was purely a tyre test bed.|$|E
5|$|The philosopher A. J. Ayer was a pupil at Ascham St Vincent's School in Carlisle Road. The artist Eric Ravilious grew up, {{was educated}} and taught in Eastbourne. In {{addition}} to Orwell, Connolly, Beaton, Maxwell and Longhurst {{listed on the}} St Cyprian's School blue plaque, the writers Alaric Jacob, E. H. W.

The biographer and historian Philip Ziegler was a pupil as was the music historian Dyneley Hussey and politician, historian and diarist Alan Clark. Other politicians were Richard Wood who had lost both legs in the war, and David Ormsby-Gore later ambassador to the USA. Artists Cedric Morris and David Kindersley also attended the school as did military figures such as General Sir Lashmer Whistler and Major General Henry Foot VC. Pupils with sporting connections include the amateur jockey Anthony Mildmay and Seymour de Lotbiniere Director of Outside Broadcasts at the BBC. Jagaddipendra Narayan was a reigning Maharaja of Cooch Behar while at the school. Other former pupils include the war-blinded life peer Lord Fraser and the submarine commander Rupert Lonsdale. NASA <b>aerospace</b> <b>engineer</b> Bruce Woodgate, who attended Eastbourne Grammar School, was the principal investigator and designer of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, which was installed on the Hubble Space Telescope in 1997.

40|$|A {{telephone}} survey of U.

The survey was undertaken to obtain information on the daily work activities of <b>aerospace</b> <b>engineers</b> and scientists, to measure various practices used by <b>aerospace</b> <b>engineers</b> and scientists to obtain STI, and to ask <b>aerospace</b> <b>engineers</b> and scientists about their use of electronic networks. Co-workers were found important sources of information. Co-workers are used to obtain technical information because the information they have is relevant, not because co-workers are accessible. As technical uncertainty increases, so does the need for information internal and external to the organization. Electronic networks enjoy widespread use within the aerospace community. These networks are accessible and they are used to contact people at remote sites. About 80 percent of the respondents used electronic mail, file transfer, and information or data retrieval to commercial or in-house data bases...|$|R
