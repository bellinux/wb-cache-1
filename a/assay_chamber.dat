40|$|The {{acetylene}} reduction assay for {{the measurement}} of N 2 fixation in a water-saturated paddy soil {{is limited by the}} slow diffusion of acetylene and ethylene. In laboratory incubation tests, vigorous shaking after the assay period is needed to release ethylene into the gas within the assay vials. Shaking prior to the incubation is also effective for dissolving acetylene in the water-saturated soil. However, a water-saturated soil depth of less than 10 mm during incubation is recommended. In field assays, some amounts of ethylene remain in the water-saturated soil phase of the acetylene reduction <b>assay</b> <b>chamber,</b> but stirring the water-saturated soil before sampling reduces the amount of ethylene remaining in soil. Evidence of a downward movement of acetylene and an upward movement of ethylene through rice plants was obtained. Because of the rapid transfer of acetylene to rice plant roots, an in situ acetylene reduction assay covering a rice hill is likely to detect nitrogen fixation in the proximity of roots where acetylene is easily accessible. Acetylene introduction to the water-saturated soil phase prior to assay did not greatly increase the acetylene reduction rate.

Force {{was applied to the}} immunochemical complex by labeling the secondary antibody with a magnetically susceptible, micrometer-size particle and placing the <b>assay</b> <b>chamber</b> in a magnetic field of defined magnitude and orientation. The force was strong enough to displace weakly bound particles but was not strong enough to rupture the immunochemical complex. The number of particles bound to the surface after applying the differentiation force was related to the analyte concentration, thus an optical detection scheme was developed for counting the number of particles on the surface. The sensitivity of the force differentiation assay was demonstrated to be one to two orders of magnitude higher than conventional solid-phase immunoassay techniques for model protein, virus, and bacterial analytes, with 99 % specificity. The enhanced sensitivity of this assay appears to result from lowering the assay background through the identification of weakly adhesive, nonspecific interactions. (C) 2000 Academic Press...|$|E

Acetylene {{was added to the}} liquid medium, and the ethylene formed was measured from both gas and liquid phases. After cutoff of mineral nitrogen supply and inoculation of fresh soil, rice plants grown from the seedling stage in water culture exhibited acetylene reduction activity after a lag period. However, rice plants grown in a paddy field and transferred to water culture were more suitable for N 2 fixation studies because of their higher, less variable acetylene reduction activity. The time course of acetylene reduction was monitored by continuous circulation of gas between the gas phase and the liquid phase, and the result showed an initial 2 - or 3 -h period of lower activity, followed by increased and almost constant activity up to 24 h. The effects on acetylene reduction activity of aeration, ammonium, chloramphenicol, and 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea addition are reported.

Daktari CD 4 Cell Counter system utilizes an interdigitated electrode foil {{in order to}} measure the concentration of the CD 4 cells in an <b>assay</b> <b>chamber</b> by measuring the impedance drop. Thus the consistency in the dimensions of the interdigitated fingers in the electrode is critical to the repeatability of impedance measurements.

For this purpose optical imaging was used to obtain high-resolution images of the electrodes and an algorithm was developed in order to estimate the critical dimensions of interdigitated fingers from the images. The results showed that the dimensional variation in the electrodes had insignificant effect on the performance of the electrodes and that the new manufacturing process is capable of producing satisfactory electrodes within the desired target.

Data from these experiments were evaluated with a model that accounted for the effect of diffusion {{on the distribution of}} substrate and the transport of cells from the chamber through the capillary orifice. By fitting a numerical solution of this model to the data, it was possible to determine the chemotactic sensitivity coefficient, χ 0.

A less computationally intensive model based on earlier approaches that ignore cell transport in the chamber resulted in χ 0 values that were approximately three times higher. The models evaluated in the present study could simulate the results of capillary assays only at low chamber cell concentrations, for which the effect of consumption on the distribution of substrate was negligible.

40|$|Abstract Background Effective {{tools for}} {{measurement}} of chemotaxis are desirable since cell migration towards given stimuli plays {{a crucial role}} in tumour metastasis, angiogenesis, inflammation, and wound healing. As for now, the Boyden <b>chamber</b> <b>assay</b> is the longstanding "gold-standard" for in vitro chemotaxis measurements. However, support for live cell microscopy is weak, concentration gradients are rather steep and poorly defined, and chemotaxis cannot be distinguished from migration in a single experiment. Results Here, we describe a novel all-in-one chamber system for long-term analysis of chemotaxis in vitro that improves upon many of the shortcomings of the Boyden <b>chamber</b> <b>assay.</b> This chemotaxis <b>chamber</b> was developed to provide high quality microscopy, linear concentration gradients, support for long-term assays, and observation of slowly migrating cells via video microscopy. AlexaFluor 488 dye was used to demonstrate the establishment, shape and time development of linear chemical gradients. Human fibrosarcoma cell line HT 1080 and freshly isolated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used to assess chemotaxis towards 10 % fetal calf serum (FCS) and FaDu cells' supernatant. Time-lapse video microscopy was conducted for 48 hours, and cell tracking and analysis was performed using ImageJ plugins. The results disclosed a linear steady-state gradient that was reached after approximately 8 hours and remained stable for at least 48 hours. Both cell types were chemotactically active and cell movement as well as cell-to-cell interaction was assessable. Conclusions Compared to the Boyden <b>chamber</b> <b>assay,</b> this innovative system allows for the generation of a stable gradient for a much longer time period {{as well as for the}} tracking of cell locomotion along this gradient and over long distances.

Inhibition of myosins via pharmacological treatments {{represents one of the}} key approaches for understanding of their roles in different cellular processes. However, the use of the standard plant myosin inhibitor, 2, 3 -butanedionemonoxime (BDM), is questioned as it requires a high concentration and may not be as specific as desired. By testing drugs that inhibit animal and yeast myosins V, the Staiger laboratory previously found pentabromopseudilin (PBP) as a potential inhibitor of plant myosins in vivo. In order to verify PBP as a plant myosin inhibitor in vitro, an actin filament gliding assay powered by chicken Myosin Va (MyoVa) was developed as a positive control using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM). Here, we partially purified a YFP-tagged Myosin XIK from Arabidopsis thaliana, and enriched it in the motility <b>assay</b> <b>chamber</b> by an antibody affinity-capture method. The enriched XIK-YFP showed actin binding activity and addition of ATP resulted in detachment of actin filaments (F-actin) from the protein, suggesting that the ATPase domain of the isolated myosin is partially functional.

An inexpensive and easy-to-use <b>assay</b> <b>chamber</b> was designed. A sediment toxicity assay was successfully performed at a lentic system impacted by acid mine drainage, at sites with different types of sediment. It consisted of a 48 -h exposure period followed by a 1 -h postexposure feeding during which the larvae were fed on Artemia franciscana nauplii. Methodologies for feeding quantification of fourth-instar larvae (10 -d old) were first developed and optimized under laboratory conditions. A. franciscana nauplii were shown to be more suited than fish flake food for postexposure feeding quantification, allowing higher precision {{and cost-effective}}ness. It also required a shorter postexposure feeding period, thus minimizing the chances for an eventual organism physiological recovery from toxicant exposure. The influence of several environmental conditions during exposure on postexposure feeding was also evaluated: temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity, hardness, substrate, humic acids, light, and food availability. Only temperature was found to significantly influence postexposure feeding rates; exposure at 5 °C led to reduced feeding activity compared to 30 °C. Recovery rates of 87 % were obtained after the 48 -h field exposure at all sites (except site R 2). A statistically significant postexposure feeding depression was observed at the three sites impacted by acid mine drainage.

The test can be performed with a turn-around time of 5 minutes and can detect concentrations in the picomolar range in a sample volume of less than 25 &# 61549;L. METHOD: The test was completed in a compact, injection molded plasticdisposable with a 0. 5 &# 61549;L <b>assay</b> <b>chamber</b> containing integrateddry magnetic nanoparticles and reagents. We have developed a 1 -stepassay in which all reaction processes were precisely controlled bythe 3 electromagnetic coils positioned {{above and below the}} disposable. In the on-sensor assay, troponin molecules were sandwiched between capture antibodies attached to the detection surface and 500 nm superparamagnetic particles functionalized with tracer anti-troponinantibodies. Nanoparticles bound to the sensor surface were sensitively detected using the optical technique of frustrated total internalreflection (f-TIR). RESULT: A calibration function measured in 100 %human plasma using our integrated test demonstrates a limit of detection (mean of blank plus 3 SD) of 0. 03 ng/mL (1 pM) cTnI for a turn-around time of approximately 5 minutes. A linear regression analysis of the region 0. 03 - 6. 5 ng/mL yields a slope of 37 ± 4, intercept of 0. 22 ± 0. 01 and linear correlation coefficient of R 2 = 0. 98. The measuring range could be extended substantially, to 100 ng/mL, by simultaneously imaging a second spot with lower capture antibody concentration.

40|$|We have {{determined}} {{the relationship between}} microtubule length and translocation velocity from recordings of bovine brain microtubules translocating over a Paramecium 22 S dynein substratum in an in vitro <b>assay</b> <b>chamber.</b> For comparison with untreated samples, the 22 S dynein {{has been subjected to}} detergent and/or to pretreatments that induce phosphorylation of an associated 29 kDa light chain. Control and treated dyneins have been used at the same densities in the translocation assays. In any given condition, translocation velocity (v) shows an initial increase with microtubule length (L) and then reaches a plateau. This situation may be represented by a hyperbola of the general form v = aL/(L+b), which is formally analogous to the Briggs-Haldane relationship, which we have used to interpret our data. The results indicate that the maximum translocation velocity Vo(= a) is increased by pretreatment, whereas the length constant KL(= b), which corresponds to Km, does not change with pretreatment, implying that the mechanochemical properties of the pretreated dyneins differ from those of control dyneins. The conclusion that KL is constant for defined in vitro assays rules out the possibility that the velocity changes seen are caused by changes in geometry in the translocation assays or by the numbers of dyneins or dynein heads needed to produce maximal translocational velocity. From our analysis, we determine that f, the fraction of cycle time during which the dynein is in the force-generating state, is small [...] roughly 0. 01, comparable to the f determined previously for heavy meromyosin. The practical limits of these mechanochemical changes imply that the maximum possible ciliary beat frequency is about 120 Hz, and that in the physiological range of 5 - 60 Hz, beat frequency could be controlled by varying the numbers of phosphorylated outer arm dyneins along an axonemal microtubule...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{ability to}} detect cold {{temperatures}} is critical for survival. Cold-sensing neurons play important roles in thermosensation, pain sensation (nociception), thermoregulation, cooling-induced analgesia, and smooth muscle reflexes in the bladder and airway. At the molecular level, cold is detected by TRPM 8, a non-selective cation channel expressed in a subset of primary afferent neurons. Genetic disruption of TRPM 8 leads to severe deficits in cold-sensing, confirming the role of TRPM 8 as the primary transducer of cold temperatures.; Though TRPM 8 is primarily a neuronal cold sensor, its activity is modulated {{by a number of}} factors, including temperature, membrane voltage, membrane lipids, intracellular pH, natural and synthetic cooling compounds such as menthol and icilin, and several chemical antagonists. Therefore {{in order to understand the}} neuronal substrates of cold-sensing, it is necessary to understand how these various elements regulate TRPM 8 function.; Here we describe a molecular pathway that governs TRPM 8 adaptation, a phenomenon where TRPM 8 activity decreases even as a cold stimulus persists. Adaptation is thought to lead directly to neuronal adaptation and provide an organism with the means to discriminate subtle temperature changes. We determine that TRPM 8 activity initiates a negative feedback loop where calcium entry through the channel leads to Phospholipase C (PLC) activation and subsequent hydrolyzation of its substrate, the membrane phospholipid phosphoinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2). We find that diminished PIP 2 levels decrease TRPM 8 activity in neurons. Moreover, we find that PLC activation and PIP 2 reduction do not alter the temperature sensitivity of the channel, but do shift the voltage-dependence of channel gating.; In addition to characterizing this adaptive regulatory mechanism, we demonstrate that two novel compounds act as selective antagonists, functionally inhibiting TRPM 8 but not the activity of related TRP channels. We determine that TRPM 8 antagonism shifts the voltage-dependence of channel gating.; Lastly, we describe the creation of a computer controlled thermal preference <b>assay</b> <b>chamber,</b> useful for investigating the physiological effects of functional TRPM 8 regulation.; The adaptive model we have presented, together with the characterization of novel TRPM 8 antagonists, provides insight into the molecular regulation of TRPM 8 function and suggests potential drug targets and pharmacological tools that manipulate the excitability of cold-sensing neurons...|$|E

To meet this goal, MPACT supports a multi-institutional collaboration, of which PNNL is a part, to study the feasibility of Lead Slowing Down Spectroscopy (LSDS). This technique is an active nondestructive assay method {{that has the potential}} to provide independent, direct measurement of Pu and U isotopic masses in used fuel with an uncertainty considerably lower than the approximately 10 % typical of today's confirmatory assay methods. This document is a progress report for FY 2011 PNNL analysis and algorithm development. Progress made by PNNL in FY 2011 continues to indicate the promise of LSDS analysis and algorithms applied to used fuel. PNNL developed an empirical model based on calibration of the LSDS to responses generated from well-characterized used fuel. The empirical model, which accounts for self-shielding effects using empirical basis vectors calculated from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix containing the true self-shielding functions of the used fuel assembly models. The potential for the direct and independent assay of the sum of the masses of 239 Pu and 241 Pu to within approximately 3 % over a wide used fuel parameter space was demonstrated. Also, in FY 2011, PNNL continued to develop an analytical model. Such efforts included the addition of six more non-fissile absorbers in the analytical shielding function and the non-uniformity of the neutron flux across the LSDS <b>assay</b> <b>chamber.</b> A hybrid analytical-empirical approach was developed to determine the mass of total Pu (sum of the masses of 239 Pu, 240 Pu, and 241 Pu), which is an important quantity in safeguards.

In addition, total Pu with much better accuracy with the hybrid approach than the pure analytical approach.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Expression of ZEB 2 in 90 clinicopathologically characterized glioma patients was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, siRNA targeting ZEB 2 was transfected into U 251 and U 87 glioma cell lines in vitro and proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were examined separately by MTT <b>assay,</b> Transwell <b>chamber</b> <b>assay,</b> flow cytometry, and western blot.

Knockdown of ZEB 2 by siRNA suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as induced cell apoptosis in glioma cells. Furthermore, ZEB 2 downregulation was accompanied by decreased expression of CDK 4 / 6, Cyclin D 1, Cyclin E, E 2 F 1, and c-myc, while p 15 and p 21 were upregulated. Lowered expression of ZEB 2 enhanced E-cadherin levels but also inhibited b-Catenin, Vimentin, N-cadherin, and Snail expression. Several apoptosis-related regulator...|$|R
40|$|Currently incurable, {{prostate}} cancer metastasis has a remarkable ability to {{spread to the}} skeleton. Previous studies demonstrated that interactions mediated by the cancer-associated Thomsen-Friedenreich glycoantigen (TF-Ag) and the carbohydrate-binding protein galectin- 3 {{play an important role}} in several rate-limiting steps of cancer metastasis such as metastatic cell adhesion to bone marrow endothelium, homotypic tumor cell aggregation, and clonogenic survival and growth. This study investigated the ability of a synthetic small-molecular-weight nontoxic carbohydrate-based TF-Ag mimic lactulose-l-leucine (Lac-l-Leu) to inhibit these processes in vitro and, ultimately, {{prostate cancer}} bone metastasis in vivo. Using an in vivo mouse model, based on intracardiac injection of human PC- 3 prostate carcinoma cells stably expressing luciferase, we investigated the ability of Lac-l-Leu to impede the establishment and growth of bone metastasis. Parallel-flow <b>chamber</b> <b>assay,</b> homotypic aggregation <b>assay,</b> modified Boyden <b>chamber</b> <b>assay,</b> and clonogenic growth assay were used to assess the effects of Lac-l-Leu on tumor cell adhesion to the endothelium, homotypic tumor cell aggregation, transendothelial migration, and clonogenic survival and growth, respectively. We report that daily intraperitoneal administration of Lac-l-Leu resulted in a three-fold (P <. 05) decrease in metastatic tumor burden compared with the untreated control. Mechanistically, the effect of Lac-l-Leu, which binds and inhibits galectins by mimicking essential structural features of the TF-Ag, was associated with a dose-dependent inhibition of prostate cancer cell adhesion to bone marrow endothelium, homotypic aggregation, transendothelial migration, and clonogenic growth. We conclude that small-molecular-weight carbohydrate-based compounds targeting β-galactoside-mediated interactions could provide valuable means for controlling and preventing metastatic prostate cancer spread to the skeleton...|$|R
40|$|Background: The epithelial-to-mesenchymal {{transition}} (EMT) {{is a major}} phenotype of cancer metastasis and invasion. As a druggable cancer target, the inhibition of protein kinase CK 2 (formally named to casein kinase 2) has been suggested as a promising therapeutic strategy to treat EMT-controlled cancer metastasis. This study aimed to evaluate {{the effect of the}} CK 2 inhibitor CX- 4945 on the processes of cancer migration and invasion during the EMT in A 549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Materials and Methods: The effect of CX- 4945 on TGF-β 1 -induced EMT was evaluated in A 549 cells treated with TGF-β 1 (5 ng/ml) and CX- 4945. The effect of CX- 4945 on TGF-β 1 -induced cadherin switch and activation of key signaling molecules involved in Smad, non-Smad, Wnt and focal adhesion signaling pathways were investigated by Western blot analysis, immunocytochemistry and reporter assay. Additionally, the effect of CX- 4945 on TGF-β 1 -induced migration and invasion was investigated by wound healing <b>assay,</b> Boyden <b>chamber</b> <b>assay,</b> gelatin zymography, and the quantitative real-time PCR. Results: CX- 4945 inhibits the TGF-β 1 -induced cadherin switch and the activation of key signaling molecules involved in Smad (Smad 2 / 3, Twist and Snail), non-Smad (Akt and Erk), Wnt (β-catenin) and focal adhesion signaling pathways (FAK, Src and paxillin) that cooperatively regulate the overall process of EMT. As a result, CX- 4945 inhibit...|$|R
40|$|Bone marrow-derived, {{circulating}} endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) {{contribute to}} neovascularization in various diseases, and represent {{a very interesting}} alternative cell source for enhancing vasculogenesis in regenerative medicine. In this study, we investigated the effects of Ginkgolide B (GB) on proliferation and differentiation of EPCs, and the involved signaling pathway in vitro. EPC proliferation, migration, adhesion and angiogenesis activities were assessed with the WST- 8 <b>assay,</b> Transwell <b>chamber</b> <b>assay,</b> cell counting and angiogenesis kit, respectively. Apoptosis was detected with annexin V and propidium iodide staining. The protein expression of angiogenesis-related makers was detected by Western blot, and related gene expression was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results showed that GB promoted the proliferation and endothelial gene expression, and markedly enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor-induced migration response and the capability to incorporate into the vascular networks in EPCs. GB protected EPCs from H 2 O 2 -induced cell death. GB induced the phosphorylation of eNOS, Akt and p 38, which in turn promoted cell proliferation and function. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that GB, at a near medical applied dose, increases the number and functional activities of EPCs with involvement of Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) /p 38 signal pathways. These ﬁndings raise the intriguing possibility that GB may {{play an important role}} in the protection and revascularization of blood vessels...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{elucidate}} {{the mechanism of}} invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma, we newly established two different cell lines with a high-motility phenotypeidesignated HI type-jand low-motility phenotype-iLI type-j from CA- 9 - 22, a human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line, through cell invasion assay-iBoyden <b>chamber</b> <b>assay.</b> When we examined the subcellular localization and protein expression of actinin- 4 using these cell lines, although the growth curves {{were not significantly different}} between the HI type and LI type, more invasion was seen in the HI-type than in the LI-type on Boyden <b>chamber</b> <b>assay</b> (p < 0. 0001). Morphologically, a larger number of sharply extended cell processes and spindle formation were observed in the HI-type than in the LI-type, and actinin- 4 was mainly distributed in these processes. Western analysis showed that the expression level of actinin- 4 was almost equivalent between the HI and LI types. These findings suggest that subcellular localization of actinin- 4 might be involved in cell motility and cancer invasion by regulating the actin cytoskeleton at the cell processes in oral squamous cell carcinoma...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG 1) was {{previously}} shown to exhibit low expression in glioma tissue {{as compared with}} that in normal brain tissue; however, the role of NDRG 1 in human glioma cells has remained to be elucidated. The present study used the U 87 MG and SHG- 44 human glioma cell lines {{as well as the}} normal human astrocyte cell line 1800, which are known to have differential NDRG 1 expression. Small interfering (si) RNA targeting NDRG 1, and NDRG 1 overexpression vectors were transfected into the SHG- 44 and U 87 MG glioma cells, respectively. Cell proliferation, invasion, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were subsequently examined by MTT <b>assay,</b> transwell <b>chamber</b> <b>assay,</b> flow cytometry and western blot analysis, respectively. Furthermore, a subcutaneous tumor mouse model was used to investigate the effects of NDRG 1 on the growth of glioma cells in vivo. Overexpression of NDRG 1 was shown to inhibit cell proliferation and invasion, and induce apoptosis in the U 87 MG glioma cells, whereas NDRG 1 downregulation increased proliferation, suppressed apoptosis and promoted invasion of the SHG- 44 glioma cells. In addition, in the subcutaneous tumor mouse model, overexpression of NDRG 1 in U- 87 MG cells suppressed tumorigenicity in vivo. The find-ings of the present study indicated that NDRG 1 is required for the inhibition of gliomagenesis; therefore, targeting NDRG 1 and its downstream targets may represent novel therapies for the treatment of glioma...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} {{mutation}} of CFTR, affecting approximately 90 % of CF patients, is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F 508 del, ΔF 508). Misfolding of ΔF 508 -CFTR impairs both its trafficking to the plasma membrane and its chloride channel activity. To identify small molecules that can restore channel activity of ΔF 508 -CFTR, we synthesized and evaluated eighteen novel hydroxypyrazoline analogues as CFTR potentiators. To elucidate potentiation activities of hydroxypyrazolines for ΔF 508 -CFTR, CFTR activity {{was measured using}} a halide-sensitive YFP <b>assay,</b> Ussing <b>chamber</b> <b>assay</b> and patch-clamp technique. Compounds 7 p, 7 q and 7 r exhibited excellent potentiation with EC 50 value < 10 μM. Among the compounds, 7 q (a novel CFTR potentiator, CP 7 q) showed the highest potentiation activity with EC 50 values of 0. 88 ± 0. 11 and 4. 45 ± 0. 31 μM for wild-type and ΔF 508 -CFTR, respectively. In addition, CP 7 q significantly potentiated chloride conductance of G 551 D-CFTR, a CFTR gating mutant; its maximal potentiation activity was 1. 9 fold higher than the well-known CFTR potentiator genistein. Combination treatment with CP 7 q and VX- 809, a corrector of ΔF 508 -CFTR, significantly enhanced functional rescue of ΔF 508 -CFTR compared with VX- 809 alone. CP 7 q did not alter the cytosolic cAMP level and showed no cytotoxicity at the concentration showing maximum efficacy. The hydroxypyrazolines may be potential development candidates for drug therapy of cystic fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} {{the role of the}} E-cadherin-repressed gene human Nanos 1 (hNanos 1) in tumor invasion process. First, our in vivo study revealed that hNanos 1 mRNAs were overexpressed in invasive lung carcinomas. Moreover, hNanos 1 was co-localized with MT 1 -MMP (membrane type 1 -matrix metalloproteinase) in E-cadherin-negative invasive lung tumor clusters. Using an inducible Tet-on system, we showed that induction of hNanos 1 expression in DLD 1 cells increased their migratory and invasive abilities in a three-dimensional migration and in a modified Boyden <b>chamber</b> <b>assay.</b> Accordingly, we demonstrated that hNanos 1 upregulated MT 1 -MMP expression at the mRNA and protein levels. Inversely, using an RNA interference strategy to inhibit hNanos 1 expression in invasive Hs 578 T, BT 549 and BZR cancer cells, we observed a downregulation of MT 1 -MMP mRNA and protein and concomitantly a decrease of the invasive capacities of tumor cells in a modified Boyden <b>chamber</b> <b>assay.</b> Taken together, our results demonstrate that hNanos 1, by regulating MT 1 -MMP expression, {{plays an important role in}} the acquisition of invasive properties by epithelial tumor cells.
