25|$|During a refueling, Spaatz was drenched {{with fuel}} when {{turbulence}} caused the hose {{to pull out}} of the receptacle. Recalling the event in 1975, Eaker said:We went over the Rose Bowl. It was very bumpy, as you can appreciate, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have appreciated, up against those mountains in January, and the refueling plane and the Question Mark were torn apart. I was piloting the Question Mark and I realized that General Spaatz had probably been drenched in high octane gasoline.|$|E
25|$|With the Russians {{being pushed}} back from Poland, Kitchener thought the {{transfer}} of German troops west and a possible invasion of Britain increasingly likely, and told the War Council (14 May) {{that he was not}} willing to send the New Armies overseas. He wired French (16 May 1915) that he would send no more reinforcements to France until he was clear the German line could be broken, but sent two divisions at the end of May to please Joffre, not because he thought a breakthrough possible. He had wanted to conserve his New Armies to strike a knockout blow in 1916–17, but by the summer of 1915 realised that high casualties and a major commitment to France were inescapable. “Unfortunately we have to make war as we must, and not <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> like” as he told the Dardanelles Committee on 20 August 1915.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to this letter, Madison visited Jefferson at Monticello {{during the first week}} of September. Their discussion was important in that it persuaded Jefferson to depart from his radical stance on dissociation from the Union, which is expressed at the end of the excerpt above. At the very least, Virginia or Kentucky taking such a stance publicly would have justified the Federalist attacks against the secessionist tendencies of the Democratic-Republicans. Madison won over Jefferson, who shortly thereafter wrote to Wilson Cary Nicholas that: [...] "From [...] I retreat readily, not only in deference to [...] judgment but because <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never think of separation but for repeated and enormous violations, so these, when they occur, will be cause enough of themselves." [...] Adrienne Koch and Harry Ammon, examining Jefferson's later writing, conclude that Madison had a significant role [...] "in softening Jefferson's more extreme views." ...|$|E
500|$|Lee was not exultant, but [...] "deeply, bitterly disappointed" [...] at the result. [...] "Our {{success has}} not been as great or {{complete}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have desired", Lee wrote to his wife. In his official report, he wrote, [...] "Under ordinary circumstances, the Federal Army should have been destroyed." [...] The North Carolinian D. H. Hill shared Lee's bitterness, and wrote that the [...] "blood of North Carolina poured like water". In a post-war article he wrote that the battle [...] "was not war; it was murder." [...] Lee did not distribute blame for the failure to reach his desired result, but there were repercussions. Several commanders were reassigned, including Theophilus Holmes and John Magruder, and his army was reorganized into two wings, one under Stonewall Jackson and another under James Longstreet. Further, Confederate artillery would now be moved in battalion-sized units, at the head of Confederate columns.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{painting}} was celebrated as a technical accomplishment, some critics were uncertain if it had the correct moral effect. The Library of the Fine Arts was critical of its [...] "pantomimic" [...] quality, which it considered [...] "calculated to excite any but such ideas <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> wish to see produced by Art", while The Examiner complained about the depiction of women being attacked, arguing: [...] "Mr Etty should not treat the fair sex in this harsh and wanton manner. We doubt his right to put {{a single one of}} them into the hands of a Demon, much less to deliver them over by the dozen to the grasp of the destroyers." [...] The Times said, [...] "We do not profess to understand what class of compositions that is which originates neither in history nor poetry—no doubt Mr. Etty does; but {{as far as we can}} comprehend his picture, which is much more intelligible than his language, it represents a quantity of able-bodied demons, who appear angry at the ladies for having stayed out so long, and who are come to fetch them home accordingly", and criticised Etty for a [...] "slovenly manner" [...] and for [...] "abusing his rich gifts, and [...] upon the wild and unmeaning what might be made subservient to much more worthy purposes". Despite this, the same critic conceded that [...] "The work is one of extraordinary power" [...] and that [...] "The figures are drawn with exquisite skill, the grouping admirably varied, and yet so combined as to present a complete picture, and the colouring vigorous and harmonious in an eminent degree." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Andrew Marr asked Corbyn [...] "do you regard {{yourself}} as a Marxist?", Corbyn responded by saying: [...] "That {{is a very interesting}} question actually.

2500|$|Yet Jackson {{would not}} be the only {{president}} to elaborate on the principles underlying manifest destiny. Owing in part to the lack of a definitive narrative outlining its rationale, proponents offered divergent or seemingly conflicting viewpoints. While many writers focused primarily upon American expansionism, be it into Mexico or across the Pacific, others saw the term as a call to example. Without an agreed upon interpretation, much less an elaborated political philosophy, these conflicting views of America's destiny were never resolved. This variety of possible meanings was summed up by Ernest Lee Tuveson: [...] "A vast complex of ideas, policies, and actions is comprehended under the phrase [...] "Manifest Destiny". They are not, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> expect, all compatible, nor do they come from any one source." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The {{belief in}} God {{has often been}} {{advanced}} as not only the greatest, but the most complete of all the distinctions between man and the lower animals. It is however impossible, as we have seen, to maintain that this belief is innate or instinctive in man. On the other hand a belief in all-pervading spiritual agencies seems to be universal; and apparently follows from a considerable advance in man's reason, and from a still greater advance in his faculties of imagination, curiosity and wonder. I am aware that the assumed instinctive belief in God {{has been used by}} many persons as an argument for His existence. But this is a rash argument, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> thus be compelled to believe in the existence of many cruel and malignant spirits, only a little more powerful than man; for the belief in them is far more general than in a beneficent Deity. The idea of a universal and beneficent Creator does not seem to arise in the mind of man, until he has been elevated by long-continued culture." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{early use}} of the land {{surrounding}} Grub Street was archery. [...] In Records of St. Giles' Cripplegate (1883), the author describes an order made by Henry VII to convert Finsbury Fields from gardens, to fields for archery practice, however in Elizabethan times archery became unfashionable, and Grub Street is described as largely deserted, [...] "except for low gambling houses and bowling-alleysor, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> call them, skittle-grounds." [...] John Stow also referred to Grubstreete in A Survey of London Volume II (1603) as [...] "It was convenient for bowyers, since it lay near the Archery-butts in Finsbury Fields", and in 1651 the poet Thomas Randoph wrote [...] "Her eyes are Cupid's Grub-Street: the blind archer, Makes his love-arrows there." [...] The little London directory of 1677 lists six merchants living in 'Grubſreet', and Costermongers also plied their trade—a Mr Horton, who died in September 1773, earned a fortune of £2,000 by hiring wheelbarrows out. [...] Land was cheap and occupied mostly by the poor, and the area was renowned {{for the presence of}} Ague and the Black Death; in the 1660s the Great Plague of London killed nearly eight thousand of the parish's inhabitants.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the return}} to 2D had been met with high praise, the {{characters}} were modeled in 3D and then pre-rendered and saved in 2D sprites rather than being hand-drawn 2D sprites, which was initially met with mixed reception from fans. Cecil explained that the game was in full HD in order achieve the highest visual quality possible, but the original animations from The Shadow of the Templars and The Smoking Mirror were created in 640×400; a move to HD would require animations three times larger, and hand-animating so many pixels might be possible, but would be a [...] "massively complicated job." [...] To further quote Cecil, [...] "The massive advantage of rendering and then modelling is that obviously the data is much more manageable, we can connect animations much more smoothly, {{we can continue to}} tweak to optimise the 2D look which we’re in the process of doing, and you can hand-touch them at the end. A lot of people have said that we should be doing 2D, and I totally respect their comments, but my opinion is that it’s just not feasible. I’m also very pleased with the way the sprites are looking anyway. What we probably need to do is communicate that the end result is they look like they’re sprites, they look like they’re 2D. So I don’t regret the decision at all, and I’m absolutely convinced it’s the right one. I just don’t think we’ve communicated as well <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have done that the end results will look like cartoony 2D sprites." [...] He also stated that 2D and 3D in HD brings the [...] "best of every world." [...] Technology written specifically to give the sprites a more [...] "cartoony" [...] look was written.|$|E
