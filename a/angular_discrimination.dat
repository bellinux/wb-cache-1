The Renix ECU has a powerful microprocessor that was advanced technology for its time. It also incorporates an engine knocking sensor that allows the computer to know if detonation is occurring, thus allowing the computer to make adaptive control by individual cylinder corrections to prevent pinging. The knock detection uses the signal from a wide bank accelerometer mounted on the cylinder head. Good {{signal to noise ratio}} is obtained primarily through <b>angular</b> <b>discrimination.</b>|$|E

40|$|We propose and {{demonstrate}} experimentally the discrimination between two spin states of an atom purely {{on the basis}} of their <b>angular</b> momentum. The <b>discrimination</b> relies on <b>angular</b> momentum selection rules and does not require magnetic effects such as a magnetic dipole moment of the atom or an applied magnetic field. The central ingredient is to prevent by coherent population trapping an optical pumping process which would otherwise relax the spin state before a detectable signal could be obtained.

As a practical technique, the method can be applied to read out some types of quantum computer. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSpatial and {{temporal}} properties of illusory contours and amodal completion were investigated using a shape discrimination task. Performance was characterized as accuracy of <b>angular</b> <b>discrimination</b> of the inducing figures (‘pacmen”) in a two-alternative forced choice (2 AFC) paradigm. First, we compared performance when four “pacmen” were organized into Kanizsa-like figures (squares and small deformations of squares) which produced the percept of illusory contours (ICs), with performance obtained with all four “pacmen” facing {{in the same}} direction, when no illusory contours were seen. Then, we {{found that it was}} possible to interfere with boundary completion and degrade performance with masking lines placed between the inducers of a Kanizsa figure. From these experiments we concluded that performance in the shape discrimination task depended on boundary completion. Next, the dependence of contour-dependent performance on the spatial scale of the figures was examined. Threshold <b>angular</b> <b>discrimination</b> was approximately scale-invariant and subjects were able to integrate visual information across gaps as large as 13 deg of visual angle. Performance in the shape recognition task for illusory and amodally completed figures was also measured. Similar accuracy was obtained either when the boundaries were modally or amodally completed. Finally, we used shape discrimination in conjunction with backward masking to explore the dynamics of boundary completion. Two different phases of the boundary completion process were observed. The first phase was revealed when the inducers were locally masked, and took ≈ 117 msec. A second phase lasted an additional 140 – 200 msec after the inducers were masked.

40|$|Abstract. Thresholds were {{measured}} for discrimination of {{direction of a}} step angular rotation of gratings. The addition of simultaneous phase displacements (translation) {{had little effect on}} rotation thresholds for gratings over a considerable range; discrimination of rotation is unaffected by random directional translations an order of magnitude larger. <b>Angular</b> rotation <b>discrimination</b> thresholds increased with interstimulus interval (ISI). Thus discrimination is based at short ISIs (180 ms or less) on a percept of rotary motion, but at ISIs of several seconds by a spatial strategy (comparing static component orientations) relying on visual memory. Data points for the short-ISI region fell below the best-fitting straight line, and the slope of the short-ISI region of the curve was steeper than that of the long-ISI region. However, when either compound or simple gratings with uncorrelated spatial frequencies were used in the two stimulus frames, there was no evidence for a separate function at short ISIs. Orientation-change thresholds {{were measured}} for simple gratings as a function of contrast and spatial frequency. The contrast func-tion showed saturation and the spatial frequency function was U-shaped. Rotation sensitivity for gratings is thus similar in its spatiotemporal properties to translation sensitivity. The findings support the proposal that rotation discrimination (at short ISIs) is achieved by a template mechanism combining signals from different directional detectors, rather than by cognitive comparison of the outputs of the directional mechanisms themselves. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Right {{cerebral}} hemispheric lateralization for spatial perception {{has been}} reported by using visual and tactile spatial tasks in brain-damaged patients, split-brain patients, and normal subjects. The main {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate whether or not kinesthetic spatial perception was dominantly processed with the right cerebral hemisphere as well. In addition to this lateralization effect, the variables of sex, response verbalization, and active versus passive movement were manipulated in the present study. Sex and response verbalization have previously been reported to affect lateralization. Thirty two male and 32 female Caucasian right handed subjects without left-handed relatives participated in two kinesthetic spatial positioning tasks. A thumb <b>angular</b> position <b>discrimination</b> task was administered by the method of constant stimuli (MOCS) and yielded two criterion measures, difference limen (DL) and constant error (CE). The second task of thumb angular position reproduction was administered by the method of average error (MOAE) and yielded three criterion measures; constant error (CE), absolute error (AE), and variable error (VE). A mixed type of analysis of variance was calculated for each of the five criterion measures and was used to test for the effects of manipulated variables. The following results were obtained; (1) a significant difference existed between responses of right and left thumbs in the difference limen (DL-MOCS); (2) actively produced constrained standard movement produced negative time error (undershoot) while passive condition resulted in positive time error (overshoot) in reproduction task. No sex or response verbalization effects were found for lateralization...|$|R

30|$|In the following, we {{investigate}} the above issues {{and show that}} under certain conditions {{it is possible to}} extrapolate the received field so as to obtain a virtual (actual plus extrapolated) array significantly longer than the real one and making it possible to improve on its original <b>angular</b> <b>discrimination</b> capability. Resorting to conventional Fourier transformation techniques, we show that the virtual array thus obtained can be associated with an augmented set of narrower beam patterns able to cover the entire horizon. Since the transformation linking the actual field samples produced by the array elements to the extrapolated data is linear, the above narrower beam patterns can be implemented by applying to the actual sensor array a set of weighing windows represented by the transformation coefficients. The results are also applicable to a transmit array using an inverse beamforming scheme with the same weighing windows.|$|E
30|$|An {{interesting}} aspect that {{is worth}} pursuing relates to {{the properties of the}} beam patterns that are implicitly generated by the rows of the transformation matrix in (16) or (17). Actually, it can be shown that through a proper choice of the parameters M, ∆, and N, the number Q of these beams and their directivity can easily exceed those achievable through uniform-weighing beamforming applied to critically spaced arrays of equal length. It seems therefore appropriate to investigate the conditions under which these beams retain the properties of being approximately orthogonal and capable to cover the entire horizon. Prospectively such an augmented set of beams can boost the spatial multiplexing properties of the MIMO communication system, provided that the environment surrounding the array antennas is sufficiently rich of obstacles with angular size comparable to or smaller than the enhanced <b>angular</b> <b>discrimination</b> capability of the array. This approach to beamforming will be referred to in the following as field extrapolation (FE)-based beamforming.|$|E
40|$|An {{electronically}} controllable, switched parasitic {{planar array}} {{can be used}} for the purpose of direction finding. The method proposed in this paper exploits the electronic beam steering, achieved by simply inserting an appropriate digital word in the antenna feeding circuit, to resolve two signals. A genetic algorithm was used to determine the strengths and the angular positions of the incoming signals in the azimuth plane. The results obtained concentrate on wideband signaling in a multipath environment, with and without the presence of noise. The antenna design and the reliability of the direction-finding method are presented. The proposed method is strongly dependent on the type of the receiving antenna (a switched parasitic planar array is superior to a ""uniform"" antenna with identical radiation patterns). Increasing the number of radiation patterns available improves the reliability of the method. The reliability of the method slightly deteriorates, as the <b>angular</b> <b>discrimination</b> of the incoming signals becomes smaller, but the results remain quite satisfying...|$|E
30|$|It {{was shown}} that the {{bandwidth}} finiteness of the field sampled by a densely spaced ULA can be exploited to extrapolate the field beyond the array extension and enhance the array angular resolution. One {{of the results of}} the paper is that it is possible, with reasonable effort, to achieve accurate extrapolation of the field over a length of the order of a wavelength, equally partitioned at the array ends, thus allowing a significant increase of the virtual array size and its <b>angular</b> <b>discrimination</b> capability when the actual array length is in the order of a few wavelengths or smaller. The proposed technique permits to build approximately orthogonal beams, narrower than those achievable through a conventional uniform-weighing approach, and featuring about the same properties as those obtained from an actual array of length equal to the extrapolation window. In scattering environments, this may boost the spatial multiplexing capability of array antennas for MIMO applications. The price to be paid is an increased implementation complexity of the antenna front-ends, notably the need to arrange more elements within the array spatial aperture, along with a greater sensitivity to self noise and to mechanical and electrical perturbations of the array elements. In the paper, we have indicated design criteria leading to a significant enhancement of array angular resolution with reasonable implementation constraints.|$|E
40|$|Neurons in macaque primary {{visual cortex}} (V 1) show a {{diversity}} of orientation tuning properties, exhibiting a broad distribution of tuning width, baseline activity, peak response, and circular variance (CV). Here, we studied how the different tuning features affect the performance of these cells in discriminating between stimuli with different orientations. Previous studies of the orientation discrimination power of neurons in V 1 focused on resolving two nearby orientations close to the psychophysical threshold of orientation discrimination. Here, we developed a theoretical framework, the information tuning curve, that measures the discrimination power of cells {{as a function of}} the orientation difference, ��, of the two stimuli. This tuning curve also represents the mutual information between the neuronal responses and the stimulus orientation. We studied theoretically the dependence of the information tuning curve on the orientation tuning width, baseline, and peak responses. Of main interest is the finding that narrow orientation tuning is not necessarily optimal for all <b>angular</b> <b>discrimination</b> tasks. Instead, the optimal tuning width depends linearly on ��. We applied our theory to study the discrimination performance of a population of 490 neurons in macaque V 1. We found that a significant fraction of the neuronal population exhibits favorable tuning properties for large ��. We also studied how the discrimination capability of neurons is distributed and compared several other measures of the orientation tuning such as CV with Chernoff distances for normalized tuning curves.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{characteristics}} {{and performance of}} a Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (TOF-MS) for coincidence measurements between electrons and ions that has been developed jointly in Sweden and Brazil. The spectrometer, used for studies of inner-shell photoexcitation of molecules in the gas-phase, has been optimized by implementing ion and electron lenses to allow the use of relatively small diameter detectors. Simulations were performed to understand the lens performance and they show that ions (electrons) could be collected without <b>angular</b> <b>discrimination</b> with a maximum kinetic energy up to ten (two) times higher than without the lens actions. A rotary vacuum chamber allows the spectrometer axis to be positioned at different angles relative to the polarization vector of the excitation beam. An important characteristic of the apparatus is that the acquisition setup allows a multi-hit capability with 1 ns resolution. Hereby, Photoelectron-Photoion-Photoion Coincidence (PEPIPICO) measurements can be performed on molecules containing two or more atoms of equal mass. A method to obtain experimental detection efficiencies of a single ion and one of one, two or three electrons has been developed. A systematic study of the interaction region has been performed to determine {{the shape of the}} photon and gas beams. Measurements on molecular nitrogen demonstrate the spectrometer's ability to resolve fragments with the same charge to mass ratio arriving within only a few ns. Simulations and experimental results of fragmentation of two singly charged cation nitrogen atoms agree, confirming that the spectrometer performance is well understood. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Multi-point {{approaches}} for sound field control generally sample the listening zone(s) with pressure microphones, and use these measurements as an input for an optimisation cost function. A number of techniques {{are based on}} this concept, for single-zone (e. g. least-squares pressure matching (PM), brightness control, planarity panning) and multi-zone (e. g. PM, acoustic contrast control, planarity control) reproduction. Accurate performance predictions are obtained when distinct microphone positions are employed for setup versus evaluation. While, in simulation, one can afford a dense sampling of virtual microphones, it is desirable in practice to have a microphone array which can be positioned once in each zone to measure the setup transfer functions between each loudspeaker and that zone. In this contribution, we present simulation results over a fixed dense set of evaluation points comparing the performance of several multi-point optimisation {{approaches for}} 2 D reproduction with a 60 channel circular loudspeaker arrangement. Various regular setup microphone arrays are {{used to calculate the}} sound zone filters: circular grid, circular, dual-circular, and spherical arrays, each with different numbers of microphones. Furthermore, the effect of a rigid spherical baffle is studied for the circular and spherical arrangements. The results of this comparative study show how the directivity and effective frequency range of multi-point optimisation techniques depend on the microphone array used to sample the zones. In general, microphone arrays with dense spacing around the boundary give better <b>angular</b> <b>discrimination,</b> leading to more accurate directional sound reproduction, while those distributed around the whole zone enable more accurate prediction of the reproduced target sound pressure level...|$|E
40|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} (MS) {{is considered}} as a gold standard for chemical analysis. A vision towards clinical/biological mass spectrometry is ongoing, to facilitate development of highly potent devices for biomedical, point of care and/or general purpose in situ analysis. The key developments in this context have been - ambient ionization sources and miniature MS systems. Atmospheric/ambient ionization methods make possible for the interrogation of biological samples particularly in situ. Miniature MS systems allow for simple, efficient, on site analysis. However, their routine combination {{for the development of}} high efficiency biological mass spectrometry systems is possible by overcoming certain key technological challenges, particularly the inefficient ion transfer pathway from ion sources (at atmospheric pressure) to mass analyzers (at high vacuum). In this thesis, fundamental electro-hydrodynamic transport studies in MS systems have been made to direct informed development of high efficiency MS systems. ^ Methods and devices have been developed, to collect gas phase ions from ambient/atmospheric pressure ion sources and transfer them over long distances for mass spectrometric analysis. Theoretical studies of ambient ion transport, continuum scale fluid dynamic simulations and experimental tests demonstrate that laminar flow can transfer ions over long distances (over 6 m). The typical <b>angular</b> <b>discrimination</b> effects encountered when sampling ions from ambient ionization sources are minimized, and the sampling of relatively large surface areas is demonstrated. Applications to multiplexed chemical analysis have been demonstrated on samples at locations remote from the mass spectrometer. Ion sampling into relatively small MS inlets and transfer of ions through MS interfaces is studied via multiphysics electro-hydrodynamic simulations. The gas phase ions sampled into MS interfaces need to be delivered to a high vacuum (at ∼ 10 - 3 Torr or lower) for mass analysis. In miniature MS systems which use compromised pumping systems to minimize weight and power, this is made possible using a novel interface design v. i. z. discontinuous atmospheric pressure interface (DAPI). The electro-hydrodynamic transport in DAPI is fundamentally different from that in conventional systems and significantly impacts instrument performance. Direct Simulation Monte Carlo methods for gas dynamics and coupled multiphysics models for ion transport have been used to elucidate the dynamics and energetics of DAPI and design high efficiency MS systems for in situ analysis. Based on fundamental understanding gleaned from simulation of DAPI-MS process, simple instrumentation for performing complex ion-molecular chemistry has been designed and evaluated. MS instrumentation development for planetary missions has been explored. The overall study has an impact on instrumentation development of general purpose MS systems. ...|$|E
