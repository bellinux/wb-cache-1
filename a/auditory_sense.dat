25|$|Although it {{was long}} {{generally}} thought that cats were unresponsive to music, {{recent studies have shown}} that they do in fact respond to music which has been created with species-specific frequencies. Results suggested that cats do benefit from music therapy when the sounds have been composed to target their <b>auditory</b> <b>senses.</b> Other findings include age-related sensitivity (older and younger cats were more responsive than middle aged cats).|$|R
50|$|Earlier virtual worlds, {{with the}} {{exception}} of Traveler (1996), offered only text chat. Voice chat was a later addition. Second Life did not introduce voice capabilities until 2007. Prior to this, independent VoIP systems, e.g. Ventrilo, were used. Second Life's current internal voice system has the added ability to reproduce the effect of distance on voice loudness, so that there is an <b>auditory</b> <b>sense</b> of space amongst users.|$|E
5000|$|The Ganzfeld (German for [...] "whole field") is a {{technique}} used to test individuals for telepathy. The technique—a form of moderate sensory deprivation—was developed to quickly quiet mental [...] "noise" [...] by providing mild, unpatterned stimuli to the visual and auditory senses. The visual sense is usually isolated by creating a soft red glow which is diffused through half ping-pong balls placed over the recipient's eyes. The <b>auditory</b> <b>sense</b> is usually blocked by playing white noise, static, or similar sounds to the recipient. The subject is also seated in a reclined, comfortable position to minimize the sense of touch.|$|E

5000|$|Sensory; {{stimulating}} animals' senses: visual, olfactory, auditory, tactile, and taste. Olfactory senses can {{be activated}} by presenting scents {{that the animal}} would encounter while hunting and mating in the wild. Caretakers include prey, predator, and pheromone scents within the enclosure. <b>Auditory</b> <b>senses</b> can be activated by playing recordings of the animal's natural habitat, animal, and vocalizations that can be heard by the species in the wild.|$|R
25|$|Balance and {{equilibrium}} {{depend on}} vestibular function and secondary input from visual, organic, cutaneous, kinesthetic and sometimes <b>auditory</b> <b>senses</b> which are processed {{by the central}} nervous system to provide the sense of balance. Underwater, some of these inputs may be absent or diminished, making the remaining cues more important. Conflicting input may result in vertigo and disorientation. The vestibular sense is considered to be essential in these conditions for rapid, intricate and accurate movement.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{demonstrated}} the visual capture effect. For example, Alais and Burr (2004) using the ventriloquist effect, found that vision is capable of taking over <b>auditory</b> <b>senses,</b> specifically with well localized visual stimuli. This means that when the stimuli producing the sound as well as vision are close together, {{there seems to be a}} direct relationship formed in the perception of these separate stimuli, that correlate them into the same sensation.|$|R
50|$|Starbucks' {{philosophy}} {{is to give}} satisfaction to consumers not only in realms of taste, but also olfactory, visual, tactile, and <b>auditory</b> <b>sense.</b> In order to purse such goals, Starbucks is {{making an effort to}} consistently create a sound, perfume, font, and taste that can appeal to consumers. All background music at Starbucks is selected and released from Hearmusic, from the main office of Starbucks. Hearmusic provides 2~3 CDs per month that contain approximately 100 songs to 9000 Starbucks shops worldwide. From this, consumers were able to enjoy coffee at a refreshing and comfortable environment. Regardless of countries and culture, consumers are able to share in similar experiences at Starbucks.|$|E
5000|$|Echoic memory {{represents}} SM for the <b>auditory</b> <b>sense</b> of hearing. Auditory information travels as {{sound waves}} which are sensed by hair {{cells in the}} ears. Information is sent to and processed in the temporal lobe. The echoic sensory store holds information for 2-3 seconds to allow for proper processing. The first studies of echoic memory came shortly after Sperling investigated iconic memory using an adapted partial report paradigm. Today, characteristics of echoic memory have been found mainly using a mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm which utilizes EEG and MEG recordings. MMN {{has been used to}} identify some of the key roles of echoic memory such as change detection and language acquisition. Change detection, or the ability to detect an unusual or possibly dangerous change in the environment independent of attention, is key to the survival of an organism. With regards to language, a characteristic of children who begin speaking late in development is reduced duration of echoic memory. In short, [...] "Echoic memory is a fast-decaying store of auditory information." [...] In the case of damage to or lesions developing on the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, or hippocampus, echoic memory will likely be shortened and/or have a slower reaction time.|$|E
50|$|Tarsiers {{are small}} animals with {{enormous}} eyes; each eyeball is approximately 16 mm {{in diameter and}} is as large as its entire brain. The unique cranial anatomy of the tarsier results from the need to balance their large eyes and heavy head so {{they are able to}} wait silently for nutritious prey. Tarsiers have an incredibly strong <b>auditory</b> <b>sense</b> because their auditory cortex is very distinct. Tarsiers also have very long hind limbs, due mostly to the extremely elongated tarsus bones of the feet, from which the animals get their name. The combination of their elongated tarsi and fused tibiofibulae makes them morphologically specialized for vertical clinging and leaping. The head and body range from 10 to 15 cm in length, but the hind limbs are about twice this long (including the feet), and they also have a slender tail from 20 to 25 cm long. Their fingers are also elongated, with the third finger being about the same length as the upper arm. Most of the digits have nails, but the second and third toes of the hind feet bear claws instead, which are used for grooming. Tarsiers have very soft, velvety fur, which is generally buff, beige, or ochre in color.|$|E

40|$|With {{emerging}} {{minimally invasive}} surgical techniques in total hip arthroplasty, {{there has been}} an increase in fractures associated with the insertion of the prosthesis into the femur. Diminished visibility necessitates a greater emphasis on the surgeon’s tactile and <b>auditory</b> <b>senses</b> to ascertain the femoral component position, ensuring maximum stability and interference fit and prevention of further component impaction and subsequent fracture of the femur. Because of the smaller incision, {{it is not possible to}} take measurements directly on the bone. Measurements must therefore be taken proximally on the femoral component. The work described in this study attempts to identify a means to supplement the surgeon’s tactile and <b>auditory</b> <b>senses</b> by using damage identification techniques normally used in civil and mechanical structures to monitor the insertion process of the prosthesis. It is hypothesized that vibration characteristics of the impact process may be used intra-operatively to determine at what position the femoral component has reached maximal interference fit and stability in the femur, referred to as “seating. ” Such information can be used to prevent further impacts and potential fracture. An ICP accelerometer was used to monitor the impact process. This paper summarizes features derived from the measured data that will be used to develop a dynamic seating indicator...|$|R

40|$|Based on our {{insights}} derived from literature {{we arrive at}} two more basic principles that form the cornerstones of our model: namely, {{the fact that the}} attenuation of the eardrum and the ossicular chain are {{at the root of the}} extremely large dynamic range of our <b>auditory</b> <b>sense,</b> and the fact that the bone conduction phenomenon is actually the result of the push-pull movement of the perilymph fluid instead of the presumed deformation of the bony structures. These three main premises form the basis for this new paradigm of the human <b>auditory</b> <b>sense...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, {{the subway}} spaces usually combine visual sense with <b>auditory</b> <b>sense</b> organs {{together}} to do orientation.

40|$|Tactile {{displays}} are an actively studied {{means to}} convey {{large amount of}} spatial information in the car. Their advantage compared to con-ventional car navigation systems is their ability to free the driver’s visual and <b>auditory</b> <b>senses.</b> Previously the tactile displays were integrated into the seat of a car to present multiple direction in-formation to the driver. However, in the commercial cars the seat is used to provide the vibro-tactile warning signals, so driver might not differentiate between navigation and warning information. Fur-thermore, {{the amount of information}} presented with tactile displays can cause significant cognitive workload, performance degradation and distraction to the driver. In this paper, we explore different methods of encoding multiple directions information with a tac-tile belt in the car. We compare the vibro-tactile presentation of spatial turn-by-turn information with a conventional car navigation system to measure cognitive workload, performance and distrac-tion of the driver. We found that drivers showed better orientation performance on the tactile display than with the conventional car navigation system. At the same time {{there was no difference in}} cognitive workload, performance, and distraction. Thus, a tactile interface can be useful to present more information than simple left or right directions in high load driving conditions in which drivers are required to observe the traffic situation with their visual and <b>auditory</b> <b>senses...</b>|$|R

25|$|Bird {{intelligence}} {{deals with}} the definition of intelligence and its measurement {{as it applies to}} birds. The difficulty of defining or measuring intelligence in non-human animals makes the subject difficult for scientific study. Anatomically, birds (the 10,000 species of which are the direct living descendants of, and so are, theropod dinosaurs) have relatively large brains compared to their head size. The visual and <b>auditory</b> <b>senses</b> are well developed in most species, while the tactile and olfactory senses are well realized only in a few groups. Birds communicate using visual signals as well as through the use of calls and song. The testing of intelligence is therefore based on studying the responses to sensory stimuli.|$|R
