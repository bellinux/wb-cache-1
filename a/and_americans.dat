5|$|Taft {{continued}} the policy against immigration from China and Japan as under Roosevelt. A revised treaty {{of friendship and}} navigation entered into by the U.S. and Japan in 1911 granted broad reciprocal rights to Japanese people in America <b>and</b> <b>Americans</b> in Japan, but were premised on {{the continuation of the}} Gentlemen's Agreement. There was objection on the West Coast when the treaty was submitted to the Senate, but Taft informed politicians that there was no change in immigration policy.|$|E
5|$|The British <b>and</b> <b>Americans</b> {{agreed to}} {{continue}} to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes. Although the British argued for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May 1943, the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland and to invade France in 1944.|$|E
5|$|The British <b>and</b> <b>Americans</b> {{exchanged}} nuclear information, but did {{not initially}} combine their efforts. British officials did not reply to an August 1941 offer by Bush and Conant to create a combined British and American project. In November 1941, Frederick L. Hovde, {{the head of the}} London liaison office of OSRD, raised the issue of cooperation and exchange of information with Anderson and Lord Cherwell, who demurred, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project that had already been penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|The Russians, {{unlike the}} British <b>and</b> <b>Americans,</b> endeavoured {{to convert the}} natives to Christianity. Many Aleuts joined the Russian Orthodox Church. Russian missionaries founded a number of churches for the natives, such as the Church of the Holy Ascension in Unalaska. A notable Russian missionary was Saint Innocent of Alaska. For {{his work as a}} missionary, bishop, and later {{archbishop}} in Alaska and the Russian Far East he was canonized. One of the earliest Christian martyrs in North America was Saint Peter the Aleut. Other important Russian missionaries include Herman of Alaska and Joasaph Bolotov.|$|E

Australia qualified quickest for the final, winning the second heat by 3.1 seconds.

5|$|During the Mexican War of Independence from 18101821, Texas {{experienced}} much turmoil. Governor Manuel María de Salcedo {{was overthrown}} by rebels in 1810, but persuaded his jailer to release him and assist him in organizing a counter-coup. Three years later, the Republican Army of the North, consisting primarily of Indians <b>and</b> <b>Americans,</b> again overthrew the Texas government and executed Salcedo. The Spanish response was brutal, and by 1820 fewer than 2000 Hispanic citizens remained in Texas. Spain {{was forced to}} relinquish its control of New Spain in 1821, with Texas becoming a province of the newly formed nation of Mexico, leading to the period in Texas history known as Mexican Texas.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1944, with an Allied {{invasion}} of Nazi-occupied Europe becoming ever more likely, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel {{was assigned to}} improve the wall's defences. Believing the existing coastal fortifications to be entirely inadequate, he immediately began strengthening them. Rommel's main concern was Allied air power. He had seen it first-hand when fighting the British <b>and</b> <b>Americans</b> in North Africa, and it had left a profound impression on him. He feared that any German counterattack would be broken up by Allied aircraft long before it could make a difference. Under his direction, hundreds of reinforced concrete pillboxes were built on the beaches, or sometimes slightly inland, to house machine guns, antitank guns, and light and heavy artillery. Land mines and antitank obstacles were planted on the beaches, and underwater obstacles and naval mines were placed in waters just offshore. The intent was to destroy the Allied landing craft before they could unload on the beaches.|$|E
5|$|Five {{athletes have}} won two medals. Philipp Schoch of Switzerland, Shaun White of the United States and Seth Wescott of the United States {{are the only}} double gold medalists. Karine Ruby of France <b>and</b> <b>Americans</b> Ross Powers and Danny Kass also won two medals. In the men's half-pipe event, American snowboarders have {{collected}} six of nine possible medals, achieving a unique medal sweep in 2002. Overall, the United States won a total of 14 medals, {{more than any other}} nation. The Americans and the Swiss collected five gold medals each. As of the 2010 Winter Olympics, 60 medals (20 of each colour) have been awarded since 1998, and have been won by athletes from 14 National Olympic Committees.|$|E

5|$|In December 1776, British forces {{occupied}} Newport, Rhode Island. American {{forces in}} New England were {{not strong enough}} to dislodge the garrison there, which was also supported by Royal Navy vessels that used Newport as a base. This situation changed in 1778, following the entry of France into the war, when the French <b>and</b> <b>Americans</b> agreed to embark on joint operations against the British. The French sent a fleet under the command of French Admiral comte d'Estaing to provide troops and naval support. The fleet arrived off the coast of New York City in July 1778 but found the port well-defended, and d'Estaing further believed that its bar would be too shallow for his largest ships to cross. He then sailed instead for Newport, where he and General John Sullivan prepared to besiege the British garrison.|$|E
5|$|Large {{numbers of}} United States {{military}} personnel were based in Australia {{during the first}} years of the Pacific War. The first US units arrived in Australia in early 1942 and almost 1million US personnel passed through Australia during the war. Many US military bases were constructed in northern Australia during 1942 and 1943, and Australia remained an important source of supplies to US forces in the Pacific until the end of the war. Though relations between Australians <b>and</b> <b>Americans</b> were generally good, there was some conflict between US and Australian soldiers, such as the Battle of Brisbane, and the Australian Government only reluctantly accepted the presence of African American troops.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{machine guns}} {{continued}} to assault the American lines, <b>and</b> <b>Americans</b> who had expended their ammunition {{were forced to}} use their weapons as clubs. Of 667 men in 3rd Battalion, over 60 percent became casualties, including the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Carl Jensen, {{and much of the}} battalion staff. Shattered, 3rd Battalion was forced to withdraw in small groups, many of its soldiers already captured or forced to escape on foot through the countryside back to American lines. Most of the retreating men were also captured. Remaining soldiers formed a provisional company of 150 for the retreat. In total 90 percent of the battalion's equipment, including weapons and helmets, was lost. Another four of the M24 tanks were also destroyed without disabling any of the North Korean T34s.|$|E
