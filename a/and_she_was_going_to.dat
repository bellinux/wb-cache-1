2500|$|Posing as {{a married}} couple, Argüello and Khaled boarded the plane using Honduran passports—having {{passed through a}} {{security}} check of their luggage—and were seated in the second row of tourist class. Once the plane was approaching the British coast, they drew their guns and grenades and approached the cockpit, demanding entrance. According to Khaled, {{in an interview in}} 2000,"So half an hour (after take off) we had to move. We stood up. I had my two hand grenades and I showed everybody I was taking the pins out with my teeth. Patrick stood up. We heard shooting just the same minute and when we crossed the first class, people were shouting but I didn't see who was shooting because it was behind us. So Patrick told me 'go forward I protect your back.' So I went and then he found a hostess <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> catch me round the legs. So I rushed, reached to the cockpit, it was closed. [...] So I was screaming 'open the door.' Then the hostess came; she said 'she has two hand grenades,' but they did not open (the cockpit door) and suddenly I was threatening to blow up the plane. I was saying 'I will count and if you don't open I will blow up the plane.'" ...|$|E
60|$|When Rosette {{received}} the letter {{she was so}} delighted that she ran about telling everyone that the King of the Peacocks was found, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> marry him.|$|E
60|$|She met his eyes, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{make some}} rejoinder; {{but before she}} had time to speak, her mother's little, clear, conciliatory voice interposed. Mrs. Vivian appealed to her daughter, as she had done the night before.|$|E
60|$|Ay, but her intellect. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> so clever, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> reads so much, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> {{taught to}} read so much more.|$|R
6000|$|... "But how's that? I saw the woman's {{husband at}} Great Hintock just afore bedtime; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on well, <b>and</b> the doctor gone then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know her," [...] Mr. Watson answered, [...] "too well. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> the Kaiser Wilhelm, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to rob me {{of twenty}} {{thousand}} pounds." ...|$|R
6000|$|McEachern {{continued}} his drumming. [...] "Don't think there's been anything underhand about this," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "She absolutely {{refused to do}} anything unless you gave your consent. She said you had been partners all her life, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do the square thing by you." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was in his}} coaxing voice; {{but it was not}} {{a moment}} when she could bear to be turned aside, like an importunate child, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> speak; but he saw the wrong fishing-rod carried out, called hastily to James, ran down-stairs, and was gone, without even looking back at her.|$|E
6000|$|At twelve {{she put on}} her {{hat with}} two jabs of the hat-pins, and hastened to the {{elevator}}, exulting in freedom. The elevator was crowded with girls in new white frocks, voluble about their afternoon's plans. One of them carried a wicker suit-case. She was, she announced, starting on her two weeks' vacation; there would be some boys, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have [...] "a peach of a time." ...|$|E
25|$|She had {{initially}} stated they will finalize the contract in 15 days, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to Eurovision Song Contest 2008 in Serbia with an English song.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; and Gwendoline {{went out}} just now {{to buy a}} few things, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to call round upon father when he has got his dinner cleared away.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Compose yourself," [...] said my mother; [...] "Bridget's bundle <b>is</b> made up, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going.</b> I'm {{sorry for}} her too, poor thing; for she seemed anxious to keep the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ah! {{why did he}} ever wake? It was so real; he {{had seen}} her so plainly; it was life; it was the very smile she wore at Ducie; that sunny glance, so full of joy, beauty, and love, which he could live to gaze on! And now he was in prison, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be married to another. Oh! there are things in this world that may well break hearts! ...|$|E
60|$|Jane Lavinia went {{slowly over}} the bridge and up the lane. If only Aunt Rebecca {{had been a little}} sorry! But the morning was perfect and the air clear as crystal, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> New York, and fame and fortune were to be hers for the working. Jane Lavinia's spirits rose and bubbled over in a little trill of song. Then she stopped in dismay. She had {{forgotten}} her watch--her mother's little gold watch; she had left it on her dressing table.|$|E
6000|$|I have a {{pleasant}} recollection of an incident {{so many years}} ago--when Madame Bernhardt came to Hartford, where I lived, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> play and the tickets were three dollars, {{and there were two}} lovely women--a widow and her daughter--neighbors of ours, highly cultivated ladies they were; their tastes were fine and elevated, but they were very poor, and they said [...] "Well, we must not spend six dollars on a pleasure of the mind, a pleasure of the intellect; we must spend it, if it must go at all, to furnish to somebody bread to eat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She’s {{been with}} us these last two trips," [...] replied the mate. [...] "She’s had {{business}} to settle in London, <b>and</b> <b>she’s</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> through your lockers to clear up, like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I may," [...] said Cecilia. She knew {{quite well}} {{that she would}} not. Nan would return to Campden on the special train, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> back west in three days.|$|R
60|$|It {{was not the}} footman who had {{answered}} the door, as usual, but Mrs. Carling's maid. She had taken the letters from the postman, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> away with them upstairs.|$|R
6000|$|A long, deeply sighed [...] "Oh-h-h-h!" [...] shuddering {{from many}} lips made him turn abruptly, and he saw, glimmering against the pall {{at the bottom}} of the darkened library, a figure vaguely white, in which he {{recognized}} a pose, a gesture familiar to him. For the others the figure was It, but for him it was preciously She. It was she, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> carry it through; she was going to triumph, and not fail. A lump came into his 96 throat, and a mist blurred his eyes, which, when it cleared again, left him staring at nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't the {{slightest}} idea. I haven't {{seen him since}} breakfast. Meanwhile cook's just furious. She caught him vanishing out the kitchen door {{and there was the}} bowl of chopped meat just about empty <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> use it for lunch. Well, you know cook. She had to change the lunch menu and that means she won't be worth living with for a week. You'll just have to speak to Red, dear, and make him promise not to do things in the kitchen any more. And it wouldn't hurt to have him apologize to cook." ...|$|E
60|$|So Una simple-heartedly {{reflected}} {{on her way}} to the Subway next morning. She could not picture what he would do, now that it was hard, dry day again, and all the world panted through dusty streets. And she recklessly didn't care. For Walter was not hard and dry and dusty; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see him again! Sometimes she was timorous about seeing him, because he had read the longing in her face, had known her soul with its garments thrown away. But, timorous or not, she had to see him; she would never let him go, now that he had made her care for him.|$|E
6000|$|The {{other girl}} laughed. “I believe {{there were several}} Walthews, and Violet is, perhaps, proud of the connection,” <b>she</b> said. “They <b>are</b> an old family, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to marry one of them.” ...|$|R
50|$|Buffy {{fears that}} being the slayer means being alone, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> deserted by {{everyone}} <b>she</b> loves. This <b>is</b> a fear that Buffy struggles with throughout {{the remainder of the}} season and in future seasons.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, {{they are}} to go along, too. Martha will go with Mary and her folks, and May will, of course, be with my mother, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> {{to try to get}} Ruth to go with her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seemed as}} if the poor old fairy godmother would go {{perfectly}} wild, and she almost made the General crazy giving orders in one breath, and taking them back in the next. She said that now something had got to be done; she had stood it long enough; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take the case into her own hands. She saw that she should have no peace of her life till the Prince and Princess and the Khan and Khant were married. She sent for the head Imam, and told him to bring those children right in and marry them, and she would be responsible.|$|E
60|$|She {{had been}} bidden {{to be out}} in the air, and she and I had walked down the avenue in search of some cukoo-flowers and king-cups that grew by the canal below. She loved them, she said, because they grew at home by the banks of the Thames, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> dress some beaupots to make her chamber gay for Emilia. The gardens might be her own, but she stood in too much awe of the {{gardener}} to touch a tulip or a flower-de-luce, scarce even a lily of the valley; but when I taxed her with it, she smiled and said she should ever love the English wild-flowers best.|$|E
6000|$|There lay {{the fairy}} spring, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> find it. No one would miss her, for she often played {{all day in}} the forest and went home with the lambs at night. The brook said, [...] "Make haste!" [...] so away she went over the wall, with Skip leaping before her, as if to show the safest stones to set her little feet on. Iris waved the raspberry-sprays, to attract her with the ripe fruit, and when the basket was nearly full, Blue-bird flew {{from tree to tree}} to lead her on further into the wood. Brownie dodged behind the rocks and fallen logs, waiting for his turn to come, as he had a fine {{surprise}} for the little traveller by and by.|$|E
5000|$|Darya Melnikova {{has become}} the face of L’Or?al. The actress starred in the {{commercial}} L’Or?al Paris Pure Zone.Darya enjoys photography <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to release the book of her stories and photos titled [...] "Pictures to attract attention".|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is one of}} my boats," [...] he said. [...] "I shall {{signal to}} her from the island to call for me. I need a change, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> out into the North Sea for five weeks' fishing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I know chatterboxes {{mean all}} right, but they forget. Now, Rose <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> a great scholar <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> a lady, very quick, too; but <b>she</b> <b>is</b> awkward, now, <b>and</b> {{my little girl}} mustn't {{make it hard for}} her." ...|$|R
60|$|The party separated, Lodloe {{going to}} his room and Calthea walking towards the summer-house. She had come that day to the Squirrel Inn with a purpose; {{she was going to be}} taught by Mr. Tippengray. In this world we must adapt {{ourselves}} to circumstances, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> adapt herself to the Greek scholar's hobby. She was a sensible woman, and did not for a moment purpose to ask him to teach her the dead languages, philosophy, or science, things in which he knew she took no interest. Indeed, she would not ask him to teach her anything, but she was going to give him the opportunity to do so, and she was quite sure that that would be sufficient for her purpose.|$|E
6000|$|Adela Gauntlet was {{all alone}} when she {{received}} this letter at West Putford. In these days she generally was all alone. That she should answer it, answer it at once, {{was of course}} certain. But how should she answer it? Her mind was soon made up, with many tears, partly for her friend and partly for herself. Caroline's happiness had been, nay, probably still was, in her own hands, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> throw it away. For herself, happiness had never been within her own reach. [...] "Be his menial servant!" [...] she repeated to herself, as she read and re-read the letter. [...] "Yes; of course she should if he required it. It would be for her to make him know {{that she could be}} something better to him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There, won't you {{be raised}} {{up to see}} her? She does look so pretty in her new pink muslin, with a double skirt, and her little hat and feather, that came from London; and there's Puck poking in the hay--he's looking for a mouse! And she's {{showering}} the hay over him with her parasol! Oh, look, Alfred!' <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> lift him up, but he only murmured a cross 'Can't you be quiet?' and she let him alone, but went on talking: 'Ah, there's Puck's little tail wriggling out--hinder-end foremost--here he comes--they are touching their hats to her now, the farmer and all, and she nods just like a little queen! She's got her basket, Alfred. I wonder what she has for you in it! Oh dear, there's that strange boy on the bridge! She won't like that.' ...|$|E
25|$|On 24 October, Seadragon {{received}} {{a message from}} Shark stating {{that she had made}} radar contact with a single freighter, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> in to attack.

6000|$|So Mr. Fotheringham {{could be}} in no real haste to be gone, and had only hurried away to avoid Theodora.

'How is Arthur?' ...|$|R
