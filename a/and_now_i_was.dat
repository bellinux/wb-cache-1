500|$|The makeup for the {{character}} of The Great Mutato was designed and created by special effects supervisor Tony Lindala. The Mutato mask went through several design iterations on paper, including 10–15 drawings and a color rendition. Constructed from latex, and containing an articulated second mouth, it cost $40,000 and took between five and seven hours to apply. In addition to the mask, Chris Owens wore contact lenses and dentures. Owens later recalled that [...] "the makeup had taken seven hours, and then I had sat around for three or four. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going {{to sit in the}} dark, and I could only see out of one eye. They put a big contact lens in." [...] Initial versions of the costume were deemed [...] "too human looking" [...] and so a newer design was chosen.|$|E
2500|$|On September 6, 1973, {{three weeks}} after announcing his intent to {{investigate}} the allegations against Rove, George H.W. Bush chose him to be chairman of the College Republicans. Bush then wrote Edgeworth a letter {{saying that he had}} concluded that Rove had fairly won the vote at the convention. Edgeworth wrote back, asking about the basis of that conclusion. Not long after that, Edgeworth stated [...] "Bush sent me back the angriest letter I have ever received in my life. I had leaked to the Washington Post, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> out of the Party forever." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{had heard}} {{of it in the}} camp, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> myself to see that it was true.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{talking of}} books, I must tell of Jack Blunt the sailor, and his Dream Book.|$|R
60|$|But <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> tired at times. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{very tired}} to-night--and you came. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> glad, only glad.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{going on}} to {{a review of the}} broad facts of the {{educational}} organization of our present world.|$|R
60|$|I was gratified to {{hear this}} bit of news. I liked Dick in many respects, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> almost ready to look upon him as a friend.|$|E
60|$|I had had my {{nightingale}} days, my cuckoo and blackbird and tree-pipit days, {{with others}} {{too numerous to}} mention, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> having my greenfinch days; and these were the last.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{going away}} {{without a word}} or a sign, or even the {{slightest}} trifle which I could cherish as a memento of her. There was a blankness about it all which deadened my soul.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> have <b>been</b> young, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> old; yet saw I {{never the}} righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread.|$|R

60|$|The man evidently did {{not know}} what to say, and as a matter of fact, neither did I. I had told him some plain truths, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> anxious to get away from him and think out my future course of action.|$|E
6000|$|... 87. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{sorry that}} God {{had made me}} man, for I feared I was a reprobate; I counted man as unconverted, the most doleful of all the creatures. Thus being afflicted and tossed about my sad condition, I counted myself alone, and above the most of men unblessed.|$|E
60|$|There is nothing, unless, perhaps, the English language, more terrible {{than the}} {{workings}} of an English railway-line. An instant before {{it seemed as though}} we were going to spend all eternity at Framlynghame Admiral, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> watching the tail of the train disappear round the curve of the cutting.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{have been}} very happy--very fortunate--very proud,' she went on. 'Too fortunate. Too happy for a little while. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> unhappy for--for life.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mal. Ha! 'tis well, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> revenged. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{in hopes}} thou wouldst have uttered treason, And {{forfeited}} thy head, {{to pay me}} fully.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed I had," [...] {{returned}} the other. [...] "And she returned it. I have ever since believed she did, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure she did." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{took a look}} at the {{branches}} about me, to see where a shower of bullets would be most likely to do me least hurt; and I took a look back at the track I had made in forcing my way in; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wholly prepared and fully ready for them.|$|E
60|$|We had a {{very good}} voyage to the Brasils, and arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay, in about twenty-two days after. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> once more {{delivered}} from the most miserable of all conditions of life; and what to do next with myself I was now to consider.|$|E
60|$|I {{had been}} so paralyzed by {{surprise}} that I had {{made no move to}} reach the deck during the awe-inspiring scene which I had just witnessed, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to be still further amazed by her next act, for Phaidor extended her hand to me and assisted me to the deck, where I stood gazing at her in unconcealed and stupefied wonderment.|$|E

60|$|All {{this time}} the boat was coming on; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to {{perceive}} {{it was the same}} boat and the same two men as yesterday. This I knew by their hair, which the one had of a bright yellow and the other black. But now there was a third man along with them, who looked to be of a better class.|$|E
60|$|All that my well-meaning friend {{suggested}} made me, of course, {{only the}} {{more eager to}} go with Jones. Where I had once been interested in the old buffalo hunter, I was now fascinated. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{with him in the}} desert and seeing him as he was, a simple, quiet man, who fitted the mountains and the silences, and the long reaches of distance.|$|E
60|$|I was in {{a furious}} temper. The events of the night before, strange though they had been, left me {{comparatively}} unmoved. I was filled, however, with a thoroughly British indignation at {{the nature of this}} note. My room had been broken into {{in the middle of the}} night; I had narrowly escaped being myself the victim of a serious and murderous assault; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> calmly told to leave the hotel! I hastened downstairs and into the office.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{richer than}} any other person in the world, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> that pauper without peer. Some day I will tell you about it, not now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Villain," [...] {{answered}} Adrian, [...] "you know why; {{you have}} betrayed me and mine, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> dishonoured, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{going to kill}} you in payment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you very little. It began with Mrs. Hudson being unjust to me, {{for the first time}} in her life. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> already better!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> greatly perplexed {{about my}} little boy. It was death {{to me to}} part with the child, and yet when I {{considered}} the danger of being one time or other left with him to keep without a maintenance to support him, I then resolved to leave him where he was; but then I concluded also to be near him myself too, that I then might have the satisfaction of seeing him, without the care of providing for him.|$|E
60|$|I {{had driven}} {{up to the}} house from the back way <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{opposite}} a side door opening on the veranda. I thought I might as well go to it, so I tucked William Adolphus under my arm and marched up the path. Just as I was half-way up, a dog swooped around the front corner and made straight for me. He was the ugliest dog I had ever seen; and he didn't even bark--just came silently and speedily on, with a business-like eye.|$|E
60|$|I {{laughed at}} Charley's fears while I {{gave in to}} the claims of his affection, and agreed to {{consider}} the last raid already performed. We had been together for two years, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> leaving the fish patrol {{in order to go}} back and finish my education. I had earned and saved money to put me through three years at the high school, and though the beginning of the term was several months away, I intended doing a lot of studying for the entrance examinations.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Rollo; [...] "it {{goes the}} {{contrary}} way. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to steer {{to a good}} place to land on the shore over there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear!" [...] he said. [...] "I {{have come}} all this way, through all these terrible places, to help you, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> of no use at all." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “I <b>was</b> sick <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> cured,” {{she told}} reporters. “I am cured, {{but it is}} up to the church to say whether it was a miracle or not.” ...|$|R
