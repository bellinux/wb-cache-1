5|$|In general, Megalosaurus had {{the typical}} build {{of a large}} theropod. It was bipedal, the {{horizontal}} torso being balanced by a long horizontal tail. The hindlimbs were long and strong with three forward-facing weight-bearing toes, the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally robust and probably carrying three digits. Being a carnivore, its large elongated head bore long dagger-like teeth to slice the flesh of its prey. The skeleton of Megalosaurus is highly ossified, indicating <b>a</b> <b>robust</b> and muscular animal, though the lower leg was not as heavily built as that of Torvosaurus, a close relative.|$|E

The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded. In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes.

5|$|Russell {{is careful}} to {{indicate}} that his support for nationalisation rests {{on the assumption that}} it can be accomplished under the auspices of <b>a</b> <b>robust</b> democracy, and that it may be safeguarded against statist tyranny. If either condition fail, then nationalisation is undesirable. In delivering this warning, Russell emphasises the distinction between ownership and control. He points out that nationalisation – which would allow the citizens to collectively own an industry – would not guarantee any of them control over the industry. In the same way, shareholders own parts of companies, but the control of the company ultimately rests with the CEO (Russell 1938:235).|$|E

Following the intense activity of 2005, forecasters predicted that the 2006 season would be only slightly less active. Instead activity was slowed by a rapidly forming moderate El Niño event, the presence of the Saharan Air Layer over the tropical Atlantic, and the steady presence of <b>a</b> <b>robust</b> secondary high-pressure area to the Azores high centered on Bermuda.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, <b>a</b> novel <b>robust</b> {{nonlinear}} motion controller with {{disturbance observer}} (DOB) for positioning {{control of a}} nonlinear single-input-single-output (SISO) me-chanical system is proposed. The controller is designed in a backstepping manner. At the first step, a PI controller is designed to stabilize the position error. Then at the second step, <b>a</b> novel <b>robust</b> nonlinear velocity controller with DOB is designed to stabilize the velocity error. By using some elegant nonlinear damping terms, the input-to-state stability (ISS) property of the overall nonlinear control system is proved, {{which leads to a}} major contribution of construction of <b>a</b> theoretically guaranteed <b>robust</b> nonlinear controller with DOB {{for the first time in}} the literature. The performance of the proposed controller is verified through application to a magnetic levitation system. Comparative studies with <b>an</b> adaptive <b>robust</b> nonlinear controller are also carried out. It is shown that the proposed novel controller while being simple is superior over the adaptive robust nonlinear controller for the experimental setup under study. I...|$|R
