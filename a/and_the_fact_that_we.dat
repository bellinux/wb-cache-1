25|$|In Shusterman’s and, also, Dewey's opinion, {{the eastern}} {{meditation}} practices repair perception for understanding {{our dependence on}} the society’s moral order. Shusterman underlines that even if, as Rorty claims, Wilfrid Sellars’s critique of {{the myth of the}} given proves that immediate, non-discursive somatic experience cannot be integrated into epistemology, it does not preclude that this experience may be usefully deployed in philosophy as such, because to think otherwise would be to wrongly conflate all philosophy with one of its sub-disciplines, i.e. theory of cognition. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can hardly imagine any form of application of the immediate somatic experience in the realm of philosophy is not a proof that this is impossible, but rather indicates that our conception of philosophy is dominated by an idealistic paradigm, naturally hostile to the body as such. The will to change this situation {{has been one of the}} reasons why Shusterman developed a philosophical sub-discipline devoted to the body and its experience: Somaesthetics.|$|E
25|$|Kirkpatrick has {{developed}} this approach further {{in connection with}} computer, or video games. In his Aesthetic Theory and the Video Game {{he argues that the}} aesthetic appeal of games does not lie where we expect to find it – in sumptuous on-screen imagery – but in the physical sensations of gameplay. Because most video game analysis is informed by conventional media theory it tends to interpret games in terms of their ‘content’, or message, viewing the game as a sign system. This overlooks {{the most important part of}} the experience of gameplay <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can often enjoy a game without ever thinking about what it, or the activity of playing it, ‘means’. In his second book on games, Computer Games and the Social Imaginary, Kirkpatrick presents a history of digital games that links their rise to the spread of neo-liberalism, a version of capitalism that fosters and relies upon a playful disposition on the part of its subjects.|$|E

2500|$|The art {{historian}} Nancy Kelker of Middle Tennessee State University {{argues that a}} vague provenance, atypical stone, unusual carving of the back, nonstandard posture, recent publication of scholarly material on Olmec jades, and an urgent interest among Mexicans to find a myth for their origin in antiquity all {{suggest that it is}} a modern sculpture. [...] In response to these arguments, the archaeologist Michael Coe and the {{art historian}} Mary Miller, both of Yale University, defended the sculpture as authentic, arguing that its similarity to Monument 34 from the Olmec site San Lorenzo, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> know little about Olmec art make it probable that this is an Olmec masterpiece from antiquity. [...] At a separate time Coe stated that if Heizer felt the sculpture was a fake based on the petrographic analysis, then [...] "something must be wrong with the petrographic analysis!". [...] Susan Milbrath also argues against the possibility of a forgery. [...] Milbrath maintains that its 1933 discovery, well before archaeologists defined Olmec culture or excavated Olmec sites, precludes falsification. [...] She suggests that the Wrestler represents [...] "a little known aspect of Olmec monumental art".|$|E

2500|$|On 6 September 2008, Quo Vadis {{played a}} concert at The Medley in Montreal, at which Stéphane Paré {{confirmed}} that Yanic and {{him would be}} leaving the band, leaving Bart as the only original member still left in the band. Bart speculated that {{the distance between the}} band and Yanic contributed to his departure; [...] "With regard to Yanic, I know {{it was a very difficult}} decision to make on his part. People change, priorities change, personal situations change and he's been flying in from Tennessee for all the shows so you can imagine with the recent developments in the US/gas prices/travel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were working remotely on the new record had probably something to do with it. I guess sometimes you have to make difficult decisions and this one was Yanic's. For sure on my end I will miss him on stage and working with him because he's been like a brother to me for 15 years and we've been through so much together." [...] At the same show, Bart's right knee, which had both ligaments torn away in a sports injury, gave in completely and he supported his entire weight on his left knee for the rest of the show. However, this was to no avail as eventually Rob [...] "The Witch" [...] from Necronomicon and Stephane from BCI had to carry Bart around for the rest of the set, eventually having him sit up on a chair for the remainder of the show. Stéphane proposed cutting the show short but Bart refused and played on till the end. In the following months, both his knees had to have surgery.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1979, Ted and Kenneth Gärdestad had {{a fourth}} attempt at Melodifestivalen {{and this time}} they won with the song [...] "Satellit", a mid-tempo rock track whose {{arrangement}} bore resemblances to Toto's 1978 hit [...] "Hold the Line". The similarities caused speculation of plagiarism in the Swedish media and disqualification from the contest. The {{connection between the two}} songs was that the song's producer Janne Schaffer had heard four of the future Toto members, Steve Porcaro, Jeff Porcaro, David Hungate and Steve Lukather, experimenting with a guitar and bass riff during the Blue Virgin Isles sessions in Los Angeles, which eventually evolved into [...] "Hold the Line". Schaffer was inspired by what he had heard when he wrote the arrangement for [...] "Satellit", but at that point neither [...] "Hold the Line" [...] nor Toto's debut eponymous album had been released. Jeff Porcaro told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet in February 1979: [...] "No, it's not a rip-off, Ted did not steal our song. Those piano triplets and that bass and guitar line go back to the 1950s <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> both have happened to use variations on the same theme in our songs right now is purely coincidental." [...] Consequently, Ted represented Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest held in Jerusalem in March 1979. After having competed four times in the pre-selections before winning and with his personal connection to ABBA, [...] hopes and expectations were high. The song scored eight points and finished seventeenth out of nineteen participating entries, making it Sweden's then-second-lowest placing in the contest. The Swedish-language single became a Top 10 hit back home in Sweden and [...] "Satellit" [...] is regarded as one of Ted's signature tunes. The English-language version of the track never charted and neither did the re-issue of Blue Virgin Isles, which included both versions, making it clear that Ted's Scandinavian audiences favoured his Swedish-language material.|$|E
