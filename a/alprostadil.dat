5000|$|<b>Alprostadil</b> {{is sold in}} the United States as {{urethral}} suppositories and in injectable form. The suppositories {{are sold}} under the brand name Muse. The injectable forms are Edex and Caverject. [...] Muse delivers <b>alprostadil</b> as a penile suppository, inserted into the urethra, at least ten minutes before the erection is needed. Caverject and Edex are similarly fast-acting, but instead are injected by syringe directly into the corpus cavernosum of the penis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alprostadil</b> is also {{available}} as a generic. The major cost is {{that it must be}} mixed by a compounding pharmacy and supplies may be difficult to obtain. The different formulations, including Bimix and Trimix, may include papaverine and/or phentolamine. A typical mix might be 30 mg of papaverine, 2 mg of phentolamine, and 20 μg <b>alprostadil.</b> As a generic, it is much less expensive than the packaged injectables. It is premixed and must be kept refrigerated and the user must load a syringe with the quantity needed.|$|E
50|$|A topical cream {{combining}} <b>alprostadil</b> {{with the}} permeation enhancer DDAIP {{has been approved}} in Canada under the brand name Vitaros as a first line treatment for erectile dysfunction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alprostadil</b> pellets are {{urethral}} suppositories {{used for}} the treatment of severe erectile dysfunction. They are marketed under the name Muse in the United States. Its use has diminished since the development of oral impotence medications.|$|E
50|$|DDAIP {{hydrochloride}} is {{a functional}} inactive excipient currently {{used in the}} topical drug Vitaros, an <b>alprostadil</b> vasodilator cream used to treat erectile dysfunction. It is also used in MycoVa, a terbinafine antifungal nail lacquer for onychomycosis currently in phase-III clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alprostadil</b> is {{also used}} for {{critical}} limb ischemia. It increases blood flow by peripheral vasodilation within five minutes and induces angiogenesis. It is most effective when the ankle pressure is at least 30 mmHg {{and at least one}} tibial artery is patent.|$|E
50|$|Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), {{also known}} as <b>alprostadil,</b> is a {{naturally}} occurring prostaglandin which {{is used as a}} medication. In babies with congenital heart defects, it is used by slow injection into a vein to open the ductus arteriosus until surgery can be carried out. By injection into the penis or placement in the urethra, it is used to treat erectile dysfunction.|$|E
50|$|Most recently, the {{compound}} {{has been made}} easily accessible in an applicable topical cream form known as Vitaros. Made by Takeda UK Ltd, it is now available in Europe and contains either 200 or 300 micrograms of <b>alprostadil</b> in 100 mg of cream which is directly administered as a topical cream applied to the urethra in a preloaded delivery device. The tip of the device {{is placed in the}} urethral meatus and the cream delivered into the urethra. Clinical trials for the treatment showed positive results in over 3000 men that it was tested on, and unlike other sexual dysfunction medication, it is said to be usable by men suffering from diabetes or heart problems and those who have undergone a prostatectomy. It has no known interactions with food, alcohol or other medications making it safer than other treatments containing <b>alprostadil.</b> Similarly to the Bimix and Trimix injections though, it must be kept under cool temperatures.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alprostadil</b> is {{also used}} in {{maintaining}} a patent ductus arteriosus in newborns. This is primarily useful when the threat of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus exists in an infant with ductal-dependent congenital heart disease, including cyanotic lesions (e.g., hypoplastic left heart syndrome, pulmonary atresia/stenosis, tricuspid atresia/stenosis, transposition of the great arteries) and acyanotic lesions (e.g., coarctation of the aorta, critical aortic stenosis, and interrupted aortic arch).|$|E
50|$|SMEDDS in {{research}} or development include formulations {{of the drugs}} anethole trithione, oridonin, curcumin, vinpocetine, tacrolimus,Mitotane, berberine hydrochloride, nobiletin, piroxicam, anti-malaria drugs beta-Artemether and halofantrine, anti-HIV drug UC 781, nimodipine, exemestane, anti-cancer drugs 9-nitrocamptothecin (9-NC) paclitaxel, and seocalcitol, <b>alprostadil</b> (intraurethral use), probucol, itraconazole, fenofibrate, acyclovir, simvastatin, xibornol, silymarin, alpha-asarone, enilconazole, puerarin (an isoflavone found in Pueraria lobata), atorvastatin, heparin, carvedilol, ketoconazole, gentamicin, labrasol, flurbiprofen, celecoxib, danazol, cyclosporine, and idebenone.|$|E
50|$|Priapism {{can also}} be caused by {{reactions}} to medications. The most common medications that cause priapism are intra-cavernous injections for treatment of erectile dysfunction (papaverine, <b>alprostadil).</b> Other groups reported are antihypertensives, antipsychotics (e.g., chlorpromazine, clozapine), antidepressants (most notably trazodone), anti-convulsant and mood stabilizer drugs such as sodium valproate, anticoagulants, cantharides (Spanish Fly) and recreational drugs (alcohol, heroin and cocaine). Priapism is also known to occur from bites of the Brazilian wandering spider and the black widow spider.|$|E
50|$|From GLA, {{the body}} forms dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA). This {{is one of}} the body's three sources of eicosanoids (along with AA and EPA.) DGLA is the {{precursor}} of the prostaglandin PGH1, which in turn forms PGE1 and the thromboxane TXA1. Both PGE11 and TXA1 are anti-inflammatory; thromboxane TXA1, unlike its series-2 variant, induces vasodilation, and inhibits platelet consequently, TXA1 modulates (reduces) the pro-inflammatory properties of the thromboxane TXA2. PGE1 has a role in regulation of immune system function and is used as the medicine <b>alprostadil.</b>|$|E
50|$|Trimix is an {{injectable}} three-drug {{prescribed medication}} {{used to treat}} erectile dysfunction. The active ingredients in the mixture are usually <b>alprostadil,</b> papaverine, and phentolamine. The injection must be compounded by a pharmacy and administered via intracavernosal injection (an injection at either side, not the base, of the penis). Trimix is typically compounded by a pharmacy in a sterile environment and then frozen. The compound is stable {{for up to six}} months while stored frozen and for one month if stored refrigerated beginning at the time of manufacture.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{patients may}} also treat themselves by injection; several MS therapies, including various interferon preparations, {{are designed to}} be self-administered by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. In some countries, erectile dysfunction patients may be prescribed <b>Alprostadil</b> in injectable form, which is self-injected directly into the base or side of the penis with a very fine hypodermic needle. Female-to-male transgender people may use hypodermic needles for self-injection of prescription testosterone. Male-to-female transgender people may also use hypodermic needles for self-injection of estrogen. This is not prevalent enough in the community for this to pose a severe risk of HIV or other infection transmissions.|$|E
50|$|Prostaglandin PGE1 (<b>Alprostadil)</b> binds G-protein linked cell surface receptors that {{activate}} {{adenylate cyclase}} to relax vascular smooth muscle. Prostacyclin - PGI2, an arachadonic acid derived lipid mediator (Epoprostenol, Flolan, Treprostenil) - is a vasodilator and, {{at the same}} time, the most potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation. More importantly, PGI2 (and not nitrous oxide) is also associated with an improvement in splanchnic perfusion and oxygenation. Epoprostenol and ilioprost (a more stable, longer acting variation) can and does successfully bridge for patients to transplant. Epoprostenol therapy can lower PAP by 29-46% and PVR by 21-71%., Ilioprost shows no evidence of generating tolerance, increases cardiac output and improves gas exchange while lowering PAP and PVR. A subset of patients does not respond to any therapy, likely having fixed vascular anatomic changes.|$|E
5000|$|A {{physical}} examination should involve {{an assessment of}} overall health along with a detailed genital examination. In men, genital examination should be performed immediately after penile exposure, to avoid changes due to external temperature. The primary intent of the male exam is to exclude genuine penile anomalies such as hypospadias, epispadias and Peyronie's disease. The presence of a significant suprapubic fat pad should be noted as well. Careful measurements of flaccid length, stretched length and flaccid girth will also be useful. If male patients insist that their penis is shrinking and disappearing, measurements after intracavernosal <b>alprostadil</b> {{may be used in}} the office to determine the true erect length and to diagnose any penile abnormalities in the erect state. [...] A {{physical examination}} should note any injuries inflicted by the patient in an effort to [...] "prevent" [...] retraction as further confirmation of Koro.|$|E
40|$|Intracavernous {{injection}} of <b>alprostadil</b> is {{the gold standard}} treatment for erectile dysfunction following radical prostatectomy. After surgery, low doses of <b>alprostadil</b> can be delivered {{for the sole purpose}} of penile rehabilitation. The only reported systemic side effects of such injections are arterial hypotension and headache. In the current report, a case of unstable angina immediately following an intracavernous {{injection of}} <b>alprostadil</b> is described...|$|E
40|$|Erectile {{dysfunction}} is {{a common}} complication of Diabetes Mellitus. Intracavernosal <b>Alprostadil,</b> the naturally occurring form of Prostaglandin E 1, has been used successfully {{in the treatment of}} erectile dysfunction. Results with <b>Alprostadil</b> have shown a poorer response, shorter duration of action and need for higher dosage in diabetic patients with erectile dysfunction when compared to the general population. No study targeted specifically to the diabetic population has been completed with <b>Alprostadil</b> so far...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether transurethral <b>alprostadil</b> {{could be used for}} the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction using colour duplex ultrasound. The ultrasonography results were compared after transurethral and intracavernous <b>alprostadil</b> administration in 20 patients with erectile dysfunction. There {{were no significant differences in}} the mean peak systolic velocities (PSVs) between the two routes of administration, but the mean end diastolic velocities (EDVs) showed significant differences, with patients treated with transurethral <b>alprostadil</b> having higher EDVs. Linear regression analysis of the PSVs reached following the two routes of administration showed a moderate relationship, but linear regression analysis of the EDVs showed no relation-ship. We concluded that transurethral <b>alprostadil</b> was an inappropriate vasoactive drug to use with colour duplex ultrasonog-raphy for the evaluation of patients with erectile dysfunction because it required a longer scan time and it was less effective and less reliable than intracavernous <b>alprostadil</b> at stimulating complete corporeal smooth muscle relaxation...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} angiopoietin- 2 (Ang- 2) and IL- 18 in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) and the molecular mechanisms through which <b>alprostadil</b> protects renal function. Methods: DN was induced by streptozotocin and intraperitoneal injection of <b>alprostadil</b> was given to diabetic mice. After 2, 4 and 8 weeks of <b>alprostadil</b> treatment, the mRNA and protein expression of kidney Ang- 2 and IL- 18 were detected by reverse transcription PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. Mouse glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs) were cultured in high glucose and treated with <b>alprostadil.</b> After transfection with an Ang- 2 -pcDNA and Ang- 2 -siRNA, both Ang- 2 and IL- 18 expression were measured by Western blot analyses. Results: <b>Alprostadil</b> treatment caused {{a significant decrease in}} the renal damage parameters. Both Ang- 2 and IL- 18 were significantly increased in DN mice and in GEnCs cultured in high glucose; however, their expression was greatly reduced by <b>alprostadil</b> treatment. Ang- 2 could also increase IL- 18 expression in cultured endothelial cells under high glucose, and this response was partially blocked by Ang- 2 siRNA. Conclusions: Ang- 2 and IL- 18 may be associated with the development and progression of DN in mice. <b>Alprostadil</b> treatment can protect renal function by reducing proteinuria. These effects are mediated, at least in part, through down-regulation of Ang- 2 and IL- 18 expression...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hemodynamic, hemorheologic, and {{metabolic}} {{changes are}} main determinants in {{the genesis of}} ischemic leg ulcers. Because prostaglandin E 1 (<b>alprostadil)</b> could successfully counteract these changes, it has been intravenously used {{in the treatment of}} this disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of <b>alprostadil</b> in the treatment of ischemic ulcers and to compare subcutaneous with intravenous administration. METHODS: Eighty patients were enrolled. Twenty-five were treated by injecting low doses of <b>alprostadil</b> around ischemic ulcers of the leg and saline solution intravenously and 25 were treated with intravenous <b>alprostadil</b> and local injections of saline solution; the control group was composed of 30 patients who received saline solution around the ulcers and intravenously. RESULTS: All patients showed a statistically significant improvement in ulcer diameter, pain, and transcutaneous oxygen pressure compared to the control group. No relevant differences in the clinical outcome in the two treated groups were found, but patients treated with subcutaneous <b>alprostadil</b> experienced no side effects and showed higher values of transcutaneous oxygen pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Both intravenous and local subcutaneous <b>alprostadil</b> are useful in the treatment of ischemic leg ulcers, but subcutaneous administration is less expensive and easier to perform...|$|E
40|$|Background: Vasoactive drug <b>alprostadil</b> {{improves}} microcirculation and can {{be effective}} in treating disorders of peripheral nerves. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) {{has been shown to}} have protective action in cerebral ischemia, disorders of spinal cord, and also peripheral nerves. However, the mechanism of action of VEGF in peripheral nerve injuries is uncertain. Objectives: To study the effect of application of <b>alprostadil</b> on the pathological and functional repair of crush nerve injuries and also the expression of VEGF. Materials and Methods: Rat sciatic nerves were crushed by pincers to establish the model of crush injury. All of the 400 sprague dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into: Control; saline; saline &#x 002 B; VEGF-antibody; alprostadil; and <b>alprostadil</b> &#x 002 B; VEGF antibody groups. The SPSS 11. 5 software was used for statistical analysis. The expression of VEGF in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), following crush injury to sciatic nerves, was studied by reverse transcribed-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, electromicroscope, and electrophysiology. The effects of <b>alprostadil</b> on expression of VEGF, repair of neural pathology, and recovery of neural function were also evaluated. Results: We found that VEGF messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was significantly increased in <b>alprostadil</b> and <b>alprostadil</b> &#x 002 B; VEGF-antibody groups, compared to the saline and saline &#x 002 B; VEGF antibody groups. The number of VEGF-positive neurons was significantly increased in the <b>alprostadil</b> group, compared to the saline, saline &#x 002 B; VEGF antibody, and <b>alprostadil</b> &#x 002 B; VEGF antibody groups. Besides, addition of this drug also caused less pathological changes in DRGs, better improvement of nerve conduction velocities of sciatic nerves, and more increase of toe spaces of right hind limbs of rats. Conclusions: The vasoactive agent <b>alprostadil</b> may reduce the pathological lesion of peripheral nerves and improve the rehabilitation of the neural function, which may relate to upregulation of the expression of VEGF, following crush injury to the peripheral nerves...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} the clinical efficacy of <b>alprostadil</b> {{in patients with}} septic shock associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and to explore its possible mechanism. Methods From January 2015 to June 2016, patients with septic shock associated with ARDS and meeting the inclusion criteria {{were involved in the}} study in department of critical care medicine in First Hospital of Lanzhou University and randomly divided into the control group and <b>alprostadil</b> group. The standard treatment was given in control group, <b>alprostadil</b> 10 μg 2 /d was given in <b>alprostadil</b> group on base of standard treatment. Monitoring indexes were recorded in 1, 3 and 6 days after enrollment. General condition of patients, APACHE Ⅱ score, ventilator conditions (PO 2, PCO 2, RR, PEEP, FiO 2, oxygenation index, airway resistance, lung compliance), mechanical ventilation time, ICU stay time, hospital follow-up, 28 -day follow-up, immune index (CD 4 +/CD 8 +), inflammatory markers (CRP, PCT, IL- 6) were monitored. Results Sixty-five patients were included in this study, 32 in control group and 33 in <b>alprostadil</b> group. At 3 and 6 days after the treatment, APACHE Ⅱ score, respiratory rate (RR), the inspired oxygen concentration (FiO 2), airway resistance, and C reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) - 6 and interleukin (IL- 6) levels significantly decreased, compared with pretreatment and 1 day posttreatment, in the two groups and lower in <b>alprostadil</b> group than in the control group on the 6 th day (P< 0. 05); at the same time, these indexes such as arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2), lung compliance, oxygenation index, CD 4 +/CD 8 + significantly increased 3 and 6 days after the treatment compared with pretreatment and 1 day posttreatment in the two groups, and on the 6 th day, significantly higher in the <b>alprostadil</b> group than in the control group (P< 0. 05). Time of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and hospital stay in the <b>alprostadil</b> group was respectively lower than that in the control group (P< 0. 05); The hospital mortality and the 28 -day mortality rate were significantly lower in the <b>alprostadil</b> group than in the control group (P< 0. 05). Conclusion　<b>Alprostadil</b> can improve the lung function in patient with septic shock associated with ARDS, shorten the time of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and hospital stay, and reduce the mortality rate, which may be associated with that <b>alprostadil</b> reduces systemic inflammatory reaction and enhance immunity by improving microcirculation.

40|$|Ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury has {{a complex}} {{pathophysiology}} {{resulting from a}} number of contributing factors. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve effective treatment or protection by individually targeting the mediators or mechanisms. Our aim was to analyze the individual and combined effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and the prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1) analog <b>alprostadil</b> on hepatic I/R injury in rats. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups (six rats per group) as follows: Control group, I/R group, I/R+NAC group, I/R+alprostadil group, and I/R+NAC+alprostadil group. The rats received injections of NAC (150  mg/kg) and/or <b>alprostadil</b> (0. 05 μg/kg) over a period of 30  min prior to ischemia. These rats were then subjected to 60  min of hepatic ischemia followed by a 60 -min reperfusion period. Hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione levels were significantly decreased as a result of I/R injury, but they were increased in groups treated with NAC. Hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and nitric oxide (NO) activities were significantly increased after I/R injury, but they were decreased in the groups with NAC treatment. <b>Alprostadil</b> decreased NO production, but had no effect on MDA and MPO. Histological results showed that both NAC and <b>alprostadil</b> were effective in improving liver tissue morphology during I/R injury. Although NAC and <b>alprostadil</b> did not have a synergistic effect, our findings suggest that treatment with either NAC or <b>alprostadil</b> has benefits for ameliorating hepatic I/R injury...|$|E
40|$|Background Endothelial cell {{nitric oxide}} synthase (eNOS), {{vascular}} endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxic inducible factor 1 -alpha (HIF- 1) are important regulators of endothelial function which {{plays a role in}} the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF). Prostaglandin E- 1 (PGE- 1) analog treatment in patients with HF elicits beneficial hemodynamic effects but the precise mechanisms have not been investigated. Methods We have investigated the effects of the PGE- 1 analog <b>alprostadil</b> on eNOS, VEGF and HIF- 1 expression in human vascular cells (HUVEC) using reverse transcription PCR and immunoblotting under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In addition, we studied protein expression by immunohistochemical staining in explanted hearts from patients with end-stage heart failure treated or untreated with systemic <b>alprostadil.</b> Results <b>Alprostadil</b> causes an upregulation of eNOS and VEGF protein and mRNA expression in HUVEC and decreases HIF- 1. Hypoxia potently increased eNOS, VEGF and HIF- 1 synthesis. The alprostadil-induced upregulation of eNOS and VEGF was prevented by inhibition of mitogen activated protein kinases with PD 98056 or UO 126. Consistently, the expression of eNOS and VEGF was increased and HIF- 1 reduced in failing hearts treated with <b>alprostadil.</b> Conclusion The potent effects of <b>alprostadil</b> on endothelial VEGF and eNOS synthesis may be useful for patients with heart failure where endothelial dysfunction is involved in the disease progress. ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Severe erectile {{dysfunction}} (ED) is not uncommon, {{as can be}} seen from the epidemiological literature, and there are several possible causes, which are not always known, or leastways evident. Having ascertained the ineffectiveness, intolerance to or rejection of pharmacological aids, the option of prosthetic surgery remains, but before this, it may be wise when feasible to use <b>Alprostadil</b> cream in association with Vacuum device. Material and methods: 12 patients, aged between 55 and 65 years, with severe {{erectile dysfunction}} without palpable cavernous fibrosis, were instructed to self-insert into the urethral meatus, 3 mg of <b>Alprostadil</b> cream, sufficient to make it easy to place the Vacuum device over the penis. Results: In the cases observed, the preliminary use of <b>Alprostadil</b> cream fast produced an erection with enough rigidity to place the Vacuum. A sufficient erection was maintained, obviously using an elastic ring at the base of the penis, to achieve penetration.

40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} effect of <b>alprostadil</b> {{combined}} with butylphthalide on the serum inflammatory factors, coagulable function in patients of acute ischemic stroke. Methods: A total of 84 cases of patients with acute ischemic stroke were randomly divided into observation group (44 cases) and control group (40 cases). The observation group was given <b>alprostadil</b> combined and butylphthalide based on conventional treatment, and the control group was given <b>alprostadil</b> based on conventional treatment. Treatment was developed for 14 d to observe the changes of serum inflammatory factors (IL- 6, IL- 8, CRP, TNF-α) and coagulation correlated parameters (PT, FIB, DDI, TXB 2, PAI- 1) between the two groups. Results: After treatment, IL- 6, IL- 8, CRP, TNF-α {{of the two groups}} decreased obviously compared with before, PT increased and FIB, DDI, TXB 2, PAI- 1 decreased obviously compared with before. All indexes of the observation group were improved more significantly than that of the control group, with statistical difference.

40|$|Introduction: Female {{sexual arousal}} {{disorder}} is a pathophysiologic state characterized clinically by persistent or recurrent inability to attain or maintain an adequate lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement until completion of sexual activity. Prior clinical experience with <b>alprostadil</b> products for men with erectile dysfunction supports {{its use in}} women with female sexual arousal disorder. Aim: To compare the effect of topical <b>alprostadil</b> with over-the-counter (OTC) lubricant on female genital arousal {{in the absence of}} visual sexual stimuli. Methods: Healthy premenopausal women without sexual dysfunction were recruited from the community to participate in the study. Of 17 women who consented, 10 were enrolled and completed the trial. The mean age of subjects was 32 years (range = 27 – 43). Study drug or placebo was applied topically to the genitals. Continuous temperature monitoring was performed. Participants completed questionnaires assessing genital sensation, effect, intensity, and duration. Main Outcome Measures: Change in temperature from baseline in vestibule, clitoris and vulva. Results: In all 10 subjects, topical <b>alprostadil</b> induced a statistically significant increase in temperature of the vestibule, clitoris, and vulva compared with the OTC lubricant. The most rapid difference in genital temperature between placebo and <b>alprostadil</b> was seen on the vulva, which demonstrated a significant difference at approximately 9 minutes.

40|$|Aim. Some stable {{prostaglandin}} analogues such as <b>alprostadil</b> {{have been}} used to attenuate the deleterious effects of ischemia and reperfusion injury. The aim of this paper was to test if <b>alprostadil</b> can decrease the ischemia- reperfusion injury in rat skeletal muscle using muscular enzymes as markers, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CPK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); degeneration products of cell membrane-malondialdehyde (MDA) and muscle glycogen storage. Methods. Thirty male Wistar rats were used in a model of hind limb ischemia achieved by infrarenal aortic cross-clamping. The animals were randomized into three equal groups (N= 10) submitted to 5 hours of ischemia followed by one hour of reperfusion. The first group (control) received continuous intravenous infusion of saline solution and the second group (preischemia, GPI) received continuous intravenous infusion of <b>alprostadil</b> throughout the experiment starting 20 minutes before the aortic cross-clamping. The third group, prereperfusion (GPR), received <b>alprostadil</b> only during the reperfusion period, with intravenous infusion being started 10 min before the clamp release. Results. There was no difference in CPK, LDH, AST or tissue glycogen values between groups. However, a significant elevation in MDA was observed in the GPI and GPR groups compared to the control group, with no difference between the GPI and GPR. Conclusion. Under conditions of partial skeletal muscle ischemia, <b>alprostadil</b> did not reduce the release of muscular enzymes, the consumption of tissue glycogen or the effects of ischemia and reperfusion on the cell membrane, characterized by lipid peroxidation.

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{visualize}} soft tissue inflammation using FOI on patients with Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) characterized by SSc-related Raynaud’s phenomenon and to detect the therapeutic response to treatment with iloprost or <b>alprostadil.</b> Methods. Twenty-one patients with SSc and Raynaud’s phenomenon and twenty-six healthy controls were prospectively included. The SSc patients were intravenously treated with iloprost or <b>alprostadil</b> over seven days. FOI was performed at baseline and after seven days using an intravenous application of indocyanine green (ICG). The hands were divided into nineteen segments per hand. All segments were quantitatively evaluated to determine changes in ICG. Results. The sensitivity and specificity of FOI in the detection of ICG enhancement in patients with SSc were 95 % versus 96 %. At baseline, 31. 5 % hand segments showed ICG enhancement. After seven days of either iloprost or <b>alprostadil</b> therapy a significant reduction in the ICG was observed which ranged from 40. 9 % to 24. 7 %. Conclusion. The study demonstrates that the FOI technique is able to visualize soft-tissue inflammation with both high sensitivity and specificity. The anti-inflammatory therapeutic effects of iloprost were slightly stronger than <b>alprostadil.</b> FOI offers promising benefits in the diagnosis and therapy of patients with SSc-associated Raynaud’s phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Release of {{nitric oxide}} and TNF-alpha, a toxic cytokine, have been {{reported}} to accelerate neuronal damage under several pathological conditions, such as trauma or ischemia in the central nervous system. In the present study, we tested the effect of <b>alprostadil</b> alfadex, a prostaglandin E I analog, on cultured microglia from the rat spinal cord. The cultured microglia were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/ml), an endotoxin, for 24 h, then the released nitric oxide and TNF- alpha in the culture media was analyzed. The released nitric oxide was detected by the Griess reaction and released TNF- alpha was measured using ELISA method. The LPS-induced nitric oxide release was inhibited by the simultaneous addition of <b>alprostadil</b> alfadex in a dose-dependent manner (0. 1 - 100 muM). The LPS-induced TNF-alpha release was also inhibited by <b>alprostadil</b> alfadex addition (0. 1 - 100 muM). The IC 50 values of <b>alprostadil</b> alfadex on nitric oxide and TNF-alpha release were about 1 and 10 muM, respectively. These results suggest that prostaglandin El possibly protects spinal cord neurons from several types of neurodegenerative damage, not only via increased blood supply, but also via inhibition of pathological immunoreactions of activated microglia.
