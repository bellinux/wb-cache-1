5000|$|In the double-entry {{accounting}} system, {{at least two}} <b>accounting</b> <b>entries</b> are required to record each financial transaction. These entries may occur in asset, liability, equity, expense, or revenue accounts. Recording of a debit amount {{to one or more}} accounts and an equal credit amount to one or more accounts results in total debits being equal to total credits for all accounts in the general ledger. If the <b>accounting</b> <b>entries</b> are recorded without error, the aggregate balance of all accounts having Debit balances will be equal to the aggregate balance of all accounts having Credit balances. <b>Accounting</b> <b>entries</b> that debit and credit related accounts typically include the same date and identifying code in both accounts, so that in case of error, each debit and credit {{can be traced back to}} a journal and transaction source document, thus preserving an audit trail. The rules for formulating <b>accounting</b> <b>entries</b> are known as [...] "Golden Rules of Accounting". The <b>accounting</b> <b>entries</b> are recorded in the [...] "Books of Accounts". Regardless of which accounts and how many are impacted by a given transaction, the fundamental accounting equation of assets equal liabilities plus capital will hold.|$|E

Some <b>accounting</b> <b>entries</b> are normally always represented as a flow (e.g. profit or income), while others may be represented both as a stock or as a flow (e.g. capital).|$|E

40|$|Introduction: This {{thesis is}} about how the <b>accounting</b> <b>entry</b> {{provisions}} are linked to corporate market value. By statistically examining accounting and share data for 56 companies listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm, {{the question of whether}} accounting information regarding provisions are value relevant for investors is studied. Listed companies shall follow the rules of IAS 37 – Provisions, Contingent liabilities and Contingent assets, when preparing financial statements. Aim: The purpose of this thesis is {{to examine the relationship between}} reported information about provisions and investors assessment of listed companies that comply with IFRS-regulations, by statistically testing the value relevance of the <b>accounting</b> <b>entry.</b> Method: The study is based on a quantitative, deductive methodological approach. The value relevance of provisions is examined by statistically testing the collected empirical data based on the two models that is described in the reference frame. Results: The conclusion to be drawn from the study is that reported provisions have no statistically significant association with return on shares and thus is not value relevant. The study shows a correlation between reported earnings and returns, which is in line with previous studies. Suggestions for future research: Based on the statistical tests, the study has revealed that the <b>accounting</b> <b>entry</b> provisions are not value relevant for investors. Something that could be interesting to further explore is why provisions are not value relevant. I also think it would have been interesting to closer examine which components of the reported results that are related to the return on the company's shares. A suggestion could be to examine this by combining a quantitative statistical study with qualitative interviews to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships that might arise...|$|R

50|$|While {{he was not}} {{the first}} {{economist}} to work in this field, {{he was the first to}} do so with double <b>entry</b> <b>accounting.</b> Double <b>entry</b> <b>accounting</b> basically states that every income item on one side of the balance sheet must be met by an expenditure item on the opposite side of the accounting sheet therefore creating a system of balance. This double entry system is the basis of nearly all modern accounting today. This allowed for a reliable way of tracking trade and wealth transfer on a global scale.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{accounting}} policies necessarily involve the subjective valuation of different items {{in order to}} give observers the best possible [...] "snapshot" [...] of a company's finances by looking at a single balance sheet or profit and loss statement. For example, a bank that has just made a lot of new loans would look good on one report, but if many of those borrowers later failed to repay then a subsequent report would look very bad. So generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) would require the bank management (and not the accountants) to estimate how many borrowers would fail to repay, and to include those losses alongside the new loans. While there are many situations common to almost all companies where management must make subjective <b>accounting</b> <b>entries,</b> critical {{accounting policies}} are often those particular to an industry or company, and are judged to be even more subjective then normal.|$|E
5000|$|Ramapo {{is run by}} a town supervisor, until May 19, 2017, Christopher St. Lawrence. In April 2016, federal {{prosecutors}} indicted St. Lawrence and a former town official, N. Aaron Troodler, on 22 counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy. The fraud related to a number of projects such as a minor league baseball stadium and condominium development, falsified <b>accounting</b> <b>entries</b> made to sell Town bonds to investors, and misappropriating funds from the Town's special tax districts (such as its Ambulance Fund) to use in its General Fund. On March 7, 2017, Troodler pled guilty to a number of the fraud charges. Jury selection for St. Lawrence's trial began on April 18, 2017. [...] St. Lawrence was convicted on May 19, 2017 of 20 felony charges. [...] Following the conviction, Ramapo Deputy Supervisor Yitzchok Ullman announced that St. Lawrence is disqualified from serving as Supervisor.

50|$|Management {{accounting}} is an applied discipline used {{in various}} industries. The specific functions and principles followed can vary {{based on the}} industry. Management accounting principles in banking are specialized but do have some common fundamental concepts used whether the industry is manufacturing-based or service-oriented. For example, transfer pricing is a concept used in manufacturing but is also applied in banking. It is a fundamental principle used in assigning value and revenue attribution to the various business units. Essentially, transfer pricing in banking is the method of assigning the interest rate risk of the bank to the various funding sources and uses of the enterprise. Thus, the bank's corporate treasury department will assign funding charges to the business units for {{their use of the}} bank's resources when they make loans to clients. The treasury department will also assign funding credit to business units who bring in deposits (resources) to the bank. Although the funds transfer pricing process is primarily applicable to the loans and deposits of the various banking units, this proactive is applied to all assets and liabilities of the business segment. Once transfer pricing is applied and any other management <b>accounting</b> <b>entries</b> or adjustments are posted to the ledger (which are usually memo accounts and are not included in the legal entity results), the business units are able to produce segment financial results which are used by both internal and external users to evaluate performance.|$|E
