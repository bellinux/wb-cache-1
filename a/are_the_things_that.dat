25|$|The A New Beginning speech {{occurred}} {{just after}} Obama met {{the representatives of}} both Israel and the Palestinian Authority. He had previously met King Abdullah on 21 April and Israeli President Shimon Peres on 5 May. There was a meeting between in the White House a Saturday morning in May 2009 between Obama, Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security advisor and Deputy Assistant to President Obama and national-security spokesperson Denis McDonough. In this meeting Obama told Rhodes and McDonough {{that he intends to}} deliver a speech to the Muslim World from Egypt’s capital Cairo. Obama’s told his aides that there are tensions between the Muslim and the West which root in colonialism. He also said that he knows from his personal experience that the West and the Islam are not separate worlds because they share things such as love of God and family. Obama told his aides that these <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> bind West and Islam together. In the meeting Obama also expressed his desire to have a piece of about Islam contributions in the speech and made sure that the equality of men and women would also be incorporated into the speech.|$|E
500|$|Eurogamer's Christian Donlan {{considered}} {{that the game}} lacked the same [...] "surprise" [...] as its predecessor, but praised the overall improvement of bosses, animations and the scope of activities available. Donlan said that the game environment was intricate and very detailed, and the abilities provided for its traversal made it [...] "hard not to feel like the world's greatest detective, on patrol". IGN's Greg Miller said [...] "the voice acting, the challenges, the amazing opening, the unbelievable ending and {{the feeling of being}} the Dark Knight—these <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> standout". Miller said that the Catwoman missions were a fun change of pace from the main gameplay, and that he [...] "adored" [...] the option to replay the game with unlocked abilities and more difficult enemies.|$|E

500|$|The Swedish {{director}} Ingmar Bergman {{called his}} own film The Virgin Spring [...] "touristic, a lousy imitation of Kurosawa", and added, [...] "At that time my {{admiration for the}} Japanese cinema was at its height. I was almost a samurai myself!" [...] In Italy, Federico Fellini in an interview declared the director [...] "the greatest living example of all that an author of the cinema should be"—despite admitting to having seen only one of his films, Seven Samurai. In France, Roman Polanski in 1965 cited Kurosawa {{as one of his}} three favorite filmmakers (with Fellini and Orson Welles), singling out Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood and The Hidden Fortress for praise. The Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci considered the Japanese master's influence to be seminal: [...] "Kurosawa's movies and La Dolce Vita of Fellini <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> pushed me, sucked me into being a film director." [...] German New Wave director Werner Herzog has cited Kurosawa as one of his greatest influences: [...] "Of the filmmakers with whom I feel some kinship, Griffith... Buñuel, Kurosawa and Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible, all come to mind." [...] When asked to list his favorite directors, Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky cited Kurosawa as one of his favorites and named Seven Samurai as one of his ten favorite films.|$|E
500|$|Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine {{noted that}} in the video, [...] "Gaga fully embraces the monstrous {{as a part of}} her." [...] Moralde further {{explained}} that previously the singer had acknowledged her role as [...] "Mother Monster", but never to the visceral, fully embodied extent that she does in the video. [...] "The things that are monstrous, the things that are different—for Gaga, those <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are beautiful," [...] he concluded. Gina Serpe from E! Online criticized it for being a [...] "Madonna rip-off", while Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone noted similarities to some of Madonna's work and the imagery from in the 1927 German expressionist film, Metropolis. Ann Powers from Los Angeles Times noted that the video paid tribute to the Goddess movement and feminism. According to her, with the video Gaga made goddess culture accessible to the mass, by portraying images borrowed from fine art, cinema and cool subcultures. Examples given by her included the portrayal of Rico as her partner, instead of a conventional-looking male or female consort. Powers further added that [...] "Gaga {{has found a way to}} place female empowerment at the center of her vision without sacrificing the gains she makes by being a daddy's girl or a 'boy toy'." [...] Megan Powers from Time criticized the video and Gaga's usage of shock-imagery, which she still found [...] "strange". The video has been noted for its cultural references and artistic similarities, not only to other recording artists such as Jackson and Madonna, but to Greek and Roman mythology, surrealism and the work of Swiss painter H. R. Giger and late fashion designer Alexander McQueen.|$|E
2500|$|While at film school, Hertzfeldt {{was drawn}} to {{animation}} {{as it was a}} less expensive form to work in. He could not afford to buy the numerous rolls of 16mm film required to shoot live action. He has stated, [...] "I think I've always approached animation from a strange angle, a bit like a regular filmmaker who just happens to animate. Editing, writing, sound—those <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> usually come first in my head. Animation is often just the busy work I need to get through to connect the dots and tell the story." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the Imperial Japanese Navy was defeated, the Emperor called Yonai to his castle. The Emperor amiably invited Yonai to {{have lunch}} together. After that, the Emperor said, [...] "I really {{appreciated}} your reign and effort not to begin the war. I think {{we are not going}} to meet often like before". He put a pen and inkstone into a case and said, [...] "These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I have used. I would like to present this as a gift to you." [...] (Agawa, n.d.). This action is extremely rare because having presented the belongings of the Emperor is the supreme honor and the utmost expression of amiability.|$|E

It’s going to affect everybody this season because that’s what’s more fun." [...] said Kitsis. On everyone in Storybrooke's memories returning Horowitz commented, [...] "One of the things that’s interesting to us to explore is this notion that just because the memories have returned {{does not mean that the}} past 28 years did not happen. Those memories, the Davids, the Mary Margarets, the Mr. Golds, all those people, who they were existed and what they did actually happened and those <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> will have to be dealt with." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anthony {{was born}} in the Red Hook {{projects}} in Brooklyn, New York City. He was born to a Black Puerto Rican father and an African-American mother, Mary Anthony. His father (after whom he is named) died of cancer when Anthony was two years old. When Anthony turned eight, his family moved to Baltimore, where he honed not only his athletic skills, but his survival skills. Kenny Minor, one of Anthony's childhood friends, said, [...] "from drugs, to killings, to anything you can name that goes on in the roughest parts of town, we've seen and witnessed hands on.

2500|$|Both Tom Brown's Schooldays and Harry Potter involve {{an average}} eleven-year-old, better at sport than {{academic}} study, who {{is sent to}} boarding school. Upon arrival, the boy gains a best friend (in Tom's case, East, in Harry's case, Ron Weasley) who helps him adjust to the new environment. They are set upon by an arrogant bully – in Tom Brown's case, Flashman, in Harry's case Draco Malfoy. Stephen Fry, who both narrates the British audio adaptations of the Harry Potter novels and has starred in a screen adaptation of Tom Brown, has commented many times about {{the similarities between the}} two books. [...] "Harry Potter – a boy who arrives in this strange school to board {{for the first time and}} makes good, solid friends and also enemies who use bullying and unfair tactics", notes Fry, [...] "then is ambiguous about whether or not he is going to be good or bad. His pluck and his endeavour, loyalty, good nature and bravery <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> carry him through – and that is the story of Tom Brown's Schooldays".|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{as soon as}} he {{was drafted}} into the Phillies organization, Buchanan drew {{comparisons}} to Kyle Kendrick, a pitcher who possesses similar attributes, specifically that they are built similarly in terms of height and weight, and that they both are reliable groundball pitchers. Also similar to Kendrick, many fans and others have overlooked Buchanan during his minor league tenure; he did not receive any interview requests during the Reading Phillies' media day in 2012, despite being one of the team's top starting pitchers. An article in The Times Herald asserted, [...] "Most of what gets Buchanan overlooked <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> get his pitching compared to Kendrick’s: He isn’t overpowering, but he uses a sinker and control on the corners to coax ground balls and keep his team in games. That capability has earned Kendrick 153 starts and 64 wins over the last seven seasons with the Phillies, not to mention a $7.7 million deal in 2014 as he approaches free agency." [...] Buchanan also possesses a strong work ethic – instead of talking to the media or celebrating with teammates after throwing seven scoreless innings and striking out nine, he completed a 45-minute medicine ball workout. In addition to the aforementioned sinker, he throws a slider and a changeup.|$|E
2500|$|Melkman, Mor-Salwo, Mangold, Zeller, & Benbenishty (2015) used a {{grounded}} theory approach to understand 1) the motivations and experiences which led young adult [...] "careleavers" [...] (N = 28, aged 18–26) in Israel and Germany {{to assume a}} helper role and 2) the benefits they report enjoying {{as a result of}} helping others through volunteerism and/or human-service focused careers. Participants reported that observing role models involved in helping roles, being exposed to prosocial values, and having opportunities to volunteer within the system in which they were simultaneously receiving care all contributed to later assumption of more stable and regular helping roles. These participants felt obliged to provide assistance to others, desired to provide this assistance to others, and felt sufficiently competent to carry out the tasks required of them in their helping role. These participants reported that helping others provided them with a sense of purpose in their lives, and also increased self-efficacy, social connectedness, and ability to cope with personal issues. Additionally, participants reported that assuming a helping role provided a sense of normalcy to their lives, as well as providing a sense of perspective on their own journey and outcomes. As one participant (a volunteer with a police department who was assigned to work with at-risk youth) shared with the researchers:"The fact that I could bring a runaway girl back to her home and I made her trust me, the fact that I located a missing girl, the fact that I escorted a rape victim to hospital and I managed to give her strength and support her, these <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> give me meaning, tell me that I'm in a much better situation than others" [...] (p. 45).|$|E
