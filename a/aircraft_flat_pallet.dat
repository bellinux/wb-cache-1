5|$|The F-22 was {{designed}} to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. Measures to reduce radar cross-section include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets that prevent line-of-sight of the engine faces from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The <b>aircraft's</b> <b>flat</b> thrust-vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles.

40|$|In this study, we {{manufactured}} {{three types}} of the wooden <b>flat</b> <b>pallet</b> with different {{in the number of}} sheets of the top board of the backside. First type (7 – 7 type); the number of sheets of the top board of the backside was seven pieces. Second type (7 – 5 type); the number of that was five pieces. Third type (7 – 3 type); the number of that was three pieces. The number of the surface of three types was all seven pieces. In the manufacturing, the staggered connections using sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) compressed–dowel were applied to the pallet, and the evaluation test in accordance with Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS Z 0602) was performed. The main results are summarized as follows: The pallet weight became small in decreasing the number of sheets of the top board and the difference of the weight was about 6 kgf (20 %). The bend rate in the bending test for each type pallet was smaller than 2. 5 % of the standard value of JIS. The residual bend rate in the bending test for each type pallet was also smaller than 0. 5 % of the standard value of JIS. Therefore, it was confirmed that the condition as the pallet of both the bend rate and the residual bend rate was cleared. In each type pallet, the condition as the pallet in the change rate of the diagonal length in the fall down test was cleared because the change rate of the each value was smaller than 3 % of the standard value of JIS. The remarkable difference of the withdrawal strength of each type pallet in the pull–out test for the staggered connections using sugi compressed dowel was not recognized. Moreover, it became clear that approximately 56 minutes in manufacturing process of one pallet can be shortened and the manufacturing cost can be decreased because four top boards of the backside of the pallet were decreased...|$|R

Rotor disc friction was also taken into account. Three escapement types were designed using geometric design principles developed. Two of these escapements were then manufactured and tested for arming time on a specially built test base. Simulation runs using the dimensions of these escapements were in excellent agreement with the experimental results.
