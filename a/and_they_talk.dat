Jackson stated in the documentary that many children, including Macaulay Culkin, his younger brother Kieran, and his sisters had slept in Jackson's bed. When Bashir asked if Jackson could see why some people might disapprove, Jackson said, [...] "See, when you say 'bed,' you're thinking sexual. They make that sexual.

2500|$|Much of the {{knowledge}} about Ashoka comes from the several inscriptions that he had carved on pillars and rocks throughout the empire. All his inscriptions present him as compassionate [...] and loving. In the Kalinga rock edits, he addresses his people as his [...] "children" [...] and mentions that as a father he desires their good. These inscriptions promoted Buddhist morality and encouraged nonviolence and adherence to dharma (duty or proper behaviour), <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> of his fame and conquered lands {{as well as the}} neighbouring kingdoms holding up his might. One also gets some primary information about the Kalinga War and Ashoka's allies plus some useful knowledge on the civil administration. The Ashoka Pillar at Sarnath is the most notable of the relics left by Ashoka. Made of sandstone, this pillar records the visit of the emperor to Sarnath, in the 3rd century BCE. It has a four-lion capital (four lions standing back to back), which was adopted as the emblem of the modern Indian republic. The lion symbolises both Ashoka's imperial rule and the kingship of the Buddha. In translating these monuments, historians learn the bulk of what is assumed to have been true fact of the Mauryan Empire. It is difficult {{to determine whether or not}} some events ever actually happened, but the stone etchings clearly depict how Ashoka wanted to be thought of and remembered.|$|E
