According to the most widespread variation of the cloak story, Saint Martin cut off half of his cloak in order to offer it to a beggar <b>and</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> he gave the remaining part to a second beggar. As he faced a long ride in a freezing weather, the dark clouds cleared away and the sun shone so intensely that the frost melted away. Such weather was rare for early November, so was credited to God's intervention. The phenomenon of a sunny break to the chilly weather on Saint Martin's Day (11 November) is called Verão de São Martinho (Saint Martin's Summer, veranillo de san Martín in Spanish) in honor of the cloak legend.|$|E
25|$|Camp Half-Blood {{is under}} attack when Thalia's tree, which guards {{the borders of the}} camp, is {{poisoned}} and slowly begins to die. In order to save the tree and the camp, someone must recover the Golden Fleece, which is somewhere in the Sea of Monsters. At the same time, Percy finds out that Grover, who has left on a quest to find the missing god Pan, has been captured by the cyclops Polyphemus and that the Fleece is on Polyphemus' island.

25|$|As in the 2002 off-season, Ed Belfour left via {{free agency}} to the Toronto Maple Leafs. To begin the 2002–03 campaign, the Stars awarded the {{starting}} goaltending position to Marty Turco, {{who went on}} to have one of the best seasons in NHL history, posting the lowest goals against average (GAA) since 1940, at 1.76. However, missing 18 games late in the season likely cost him a shot at the Vezina Trophy, awarded to the league's top goaltender. Regardless, the Stars posted {{the best record in the}} Western Conference at 46–17–15–4, <b>and</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> two-way star Jere Lehtinen won his third Frank J. Selke Trophy. In the playoffs, the Stars once again met the Edmonton Oilers, and once again the Oilers would prove a contentious opponent, winning two of the first three games. However, the Stars would prove the better team again by winning the next three games to take the series in six games. The Stars' second round series against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim got off to an unbelievable start, as the game went deep into overtime tied 3–3. However, Mighty Ducks goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere stopped 60 shots as the Ducks scored early in the fifth overtime. Game 2 would be more of the same, as the Ducks stunned the Stars in overtime. Desperately needing a win, the Stars bounced back to take Game 3 in Anaheim. However, the Ducks would take a 3–1 series lead by breaking a scoreless tie late in the third period of Game 4. In Game 5, the Stars finally solved Giguere by scoring four goals to keep their playoff hopes alive. However, the Stars dreams of a return trip to the Stanley Cup Finals would end in heartbreaking fashionm as the Ducks broke a 3–3 tie with 1:06 left in Game 6 on a goal by defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh.|$|E

500|$|Sylvia Pankhurst became {{increasingly}} disillusioned with the suffragette movement's inability {{to engage with}} the needs of working class women, so in 1912 she formed her own breakaway movement, the East London Federation of Suffragettes. [...] She based it at a baker's shop at Bow emblazoned with the slogan, [...] "Votes for Women", in large gold letters. The local Member of Parliament, George Lansbury, resigned his seat in the House of Commons to stand for election on a platform of women's enfranchisement. Pankhurst supported him in this, and Bow Road became the campaign office, culminating in a huge rally in nearby Victoria Park. Lansbury was narrowly defeated in the election, however, and support for the project in the East End was withdrawn. Pankhurst refocused her efforts, and with the outbreak of the First World War, she began a nursery, clinic and cost price canteen for the poor at the bakery. A paper, the Women's Dreadnought, was published to bring her campaign to a wider audience. Pankhurst spent twelve years in Bow fighting for women's rights. During this time, she risked constant arrest and spent many months in Holloway Prison, often on hunger strike. She finally achieved her aim of full adult female suffrage in 1928, <b>and</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> she alleviated some of the poverty and misery, and improved social conditions for all in the East End.|$|E
