25|$|The {{value of}} Riis's {{autobiography}} {{lies in the}} description of his origins as a social reformer. His early experiences in Ribe gave Riis a yardstick with which to measure tenement dwellers’ quality of life. The account of the development of his powers of observation through his experiences as a poor immigrant lent authenticity to his news articles and larger works. Its themes about self-sufficiency, perseverance, and material success are prime examples of an archetype that successful Europeans like Riis used to demonstrate the exceptional opportunities that seem to exist only in the United States. In spite of its triumphalist outlook, The Making of an American remains useful as a source for students of immigration history and sociology who {{want to learn more about}} the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>How</b> The Other Half Lives and the social reform movement that he helped to define.|$|E
25|$|Norbert Wiener's {{book was}} {{the forerunner of}} studies in cybernetics, and has {{influenced}} many theorists. It has impacted the fields of computers and technology, engineering, biology, sociology, and {{a broad range of}} other sciences. Numerous books have been published in relation to cybernetics theory which explore alternative concepts and models of feedback, human/machine relationships, systems science, and industrial advancement. William Ross Ashby, another founder of cybernetics, wrote the book Introduction to Cybernetics, which presents many new interpretations and definitions. Other theorists have produced writings on systems, communication, and the human experience in cybernetics. N. Katherine Hayles, <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>How</b> We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics, describes the effects of technology in the age of virtual information and what it means for humans to live in an ever-advancing society. The American Society for Cybernetics (ASC) is a research association founded in 1964, the same year Wiener died, and is dedicated to the cooperative understanding and further improvement of cybernetics theory.|$|E

Jerome Groopman, <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>How</b> Doctors Think, says these are [...] "cognitive pitfalls", biases which cloud our logic. For example, a practitioner may overvalue the first data encountered, skewing his thinking (or recent or dramatic cases which come quickly to mind and may color judgement). Another pitfall is where stereotypes may prejudice thinking.|$|E

2500|$|Stavans {{has devoted}} {{many years of}} study {{to the work of}} Gabriel García Márquez. His biography, Gabriel García Márquez: The Early Years, slated for {{publication}} in 2010, is the first of two planned volumes. The biography traces Gabriel García Márquez's artistic development from childhood to the publication of One Hundred Years of Solitude in Spanish in 1967 and its English translation by Gregory Rabassa in 1970. Julia Alvarez, <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>How</b> the García Girls Lost Their Accents, has called this biography [...] "an engaging, informative study tracking the small beginnings of a literary giant and his magnum opus. It is also a love story: that of an important contemporary critic and thinker with a writer, his life, and his text. Stavans enlightens us, not just about one literary figure, but about the culture and history of a whole hemisphere in a book that never feels plodding or overtly academic. Stavans is a magical writer himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Edith Terry, <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>How</b> Asia Got Rich, {{said that}} because Japanese people are [...] "mastering" [...] a [...] "Western game" [...] people have some pride {{and at the same}} time feel {{insecurity}} because the [...] "game" [...] is on [...] "Western terms" [...] rather than [...] "Japanese terms." [...] The standard presentation of Japanese names in English differs from the standard presentations of modern Chinese names, since modern Chinese names are usually not reversed to fit the western order in English, except when the Chinese person is living or traveling outside of China. The convention regarding Japanese names also differs from Korean names, which are usually in Korean order unless the Korean person is abroad. Power wrote that the difference between the treatment of Japanese names and of Chinese and Korean names often results in confusion. Terry wrote, [...] "it was one of the ironies of the late twentieth century that Japan remained stranded in the formal devices underlining its historical quest for equality with the West, while China set its own terms, in language as in big-power politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|The usual {{presentation}} of Chinese names in English {{differs from the}} usual presentations of modern Japanese names, since modern Japanese names are usually reversed to fit the western order in English. In English the {{presentation of}} Chinese names is {{similar to those of}} Korean names. Edith Terry, <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>How</b> Asia Got Rich, said that [...] "it was one of the ironies of the late twentieth century that Japan remained stranded in the formal devices underlining its historical quest for equality with the West, while China set its own terms, in language as in big-power politics." [...] As of 1989, Pinyin became the preferred romanization system in works discussing contemporary China, while English-language books relevant to Japanese history still used the Wade–Giles system to romanize Chinese names more often than other romanization systems. As of 1993, Wade–Giles was still used in Taiwan. Unlike mainland Chinese, Taiwanese people usually place a dash between the two characters of the given name, similar to Korean names. This is also the case for the standard styling of Hong Kong Chinese names, where the given name is hyphenated. Names of Malaysian Chinese and Singaporean Chinese people are often expressed in three parts.|$|E
