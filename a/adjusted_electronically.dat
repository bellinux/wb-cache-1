40|$|The use of pulsed lasers in such {{applications}} as surgical tissue ablation has motivated investigative {{works to}} better understand the laser ablation mechanisms in several tissues types. When a laser pulse with sufficient energy, above some threshold value, hits a material or a biological tissue, a plume consisting of steam, particles and molten ejecta rapidly expands from the target site. Many different methods such as the laser beam deflection technique have been developed in search of a useful tool for studying the ablation process. A novel probe-beam technique can be employed to access the ejected mass in the ablation. In this work, we use a Nd:YAG laser operating at the fundamental 1. 06 µm wavelength to generate an ablation plume. The sample used is a biological soft tissue due to its high absorption degree for infrared radiation. A helium-neon laser is used to detect the smoke-like plume that scatters the laser light. This light is collected by a 600 µm optical fiber and sent to a spectrometer. A 256 x 1024 intensified CCD with 5 ns gating capability is connected to the detector port. The CCD gating and time delay is controlled by a delay generator.

40|$|The {{relative}} atomic {{composition of}} the laser-generated ablation plume in chicken myocardium is investigated by using luminescence spectroscopy. A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser emitting at 1064 nm with 9 ns pulse duration {{was used for the}} tissue ablation. The selected output energy was 210 mJ and the beam was focused to a 0. 8 mm diameter spot size by using a 40 cm focal length lens. The luminescence emitted by the lasers-generated plasma due to the tissue ablation was collected by a 600 µm fused silica fiber. The collected light was coupled into a m spectrometer. An intensified CCD with 256 x 1024 pixels was connected at the monocromator detector port. The specified CCD gating capability was 5 ns and it was controlled by a DG 535 model delay generator. The gate width was <b>adjusted</b> <b>electronically</b> to the desired time window. Four gates (100 µs, 10 µs, 5 µs and 100 ns) were tested and the ideal one, that presented more information about the samples under study, was the 5 µs window. The analysis of the spectral emission pointed out the presence of sodium, potassium, calcium, hydrogen and others. Each element was identified separately and compared to the common elements in tissues. In the extra-cellular matrix the presence of sodium prevails and in the intra-cellular space potassium predominates together with calcium and magnesium. The water diffusion through the membranes of living tissues carries ions of these elements. The perfect equilibrium between these distributions is necessary for the healthy maintenance of the organism. The measurement of the relative atomic composition by means of the laser ablation might lead to a diagnosis technique for the discrimination of different materials or tissues and even pathological conditions that promote chemical alterations to them...|$|E
40|$|Liebherr mobile harbor cranes use {{electrical}} generators {{to provide}} electrical power for load attachment {{devices such as}} container spreaders or magnets. Upcoming exhaust and noise emission standards and energy saving considerations lead to a broad diesel engine speed range. The challenging design aspect is to ensure a constant speed of the asynchronous generator by the hydraulic drive system. In addition, electrical load profiles of inductive consumers usually have DT 1 system characteristics with very small time constants. They evoke fast torque variations interfacing the hydraulic transmission. Liebherr mobile harbor cranes, see Figure 1, usually have a closed hydraulic circuit containing a hydraulic pump with a high displacement volume that is <b>adjusted</b> <b>electronically</b> in accordance to the current diesel engine speed. Regarding the energy saving aspects, a further minimization of the diesel engine speed leads to a larger pump size with increasing torque losses. Depending on the pressure setting, the volume flows can be reduced in constant pressure grids. Especially in part-load operation this results in better efficiency compared to closed hydraulic circuits by minimizing the displacement volume of hydraulic components. To obtain a stable generator speed, {{it is essential to}} adjust the displacement volume of the hydraulic unit for equalizing its input torque with the Figure 1 : LHM 800 Group 10 - Mobile Hydraulics | Paper 10 - 5 199 generator load torque. In interaction with the software-based control architecture, the stability of the electrical frequency depends on the mass inertia of the generator drive and time constants of the embedded hydraulic actuators. The system model, represented by ODEs is established and verified with a hydraulic simulation software. On that basis, the design approach of a PI-state-controller is presented. Corresponding controller gains and state feedback parameters are determined by pole placement techniques. To conclude this investigation a comparison between the hydraulically closed circuit and the constant pressure grid is shown by simulation and measurement data...|$|E
