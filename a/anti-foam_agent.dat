50|$|A {{defoamer}} or an {{anti-foaming agent}} is a chemical additive that reduces and hinders {{the formation of}} foam in industrial process liquids. The terms <b>anti-foam</b> <b>agent</b> and defoamer are often used interchangeably. Commonly used agents are insoluble oils, polydimethylsiloxanes and other silicones, certain alcohols, stearates and glycols. The additive is used to prevent formation of foam or is added to break a foam already formed.|$|E
40|$|Mass {{transfer}} {{rates were}} measured {{in a large}} scale system, which consisted of an 8. 4 meter tall by 0. 76 meter diameter column containing one of three fluids: water with an <b>anti-foam</b> <b>agent,</b> water without an <b>anti-foam</b> <b>agent,</b> and AZ 101 simulant, which simulated a non-Newtonian nuclear waste. The testing contributed to the evaluation of large scale mass transfer of hydrogen in nuclear waste tanks. Due to its radioactivity, the waste was chemically simulated, and due to flammability concerns oxygen was used in lieu of hydrogen. Different liquids were used to better understand the mass transfer processes, where each of the fluids was saturated with oxygen, and the oxygen was then removed from solution as air bubbled up, or sparged, through the solution {{from the bottom of the}} column. Air sparging was supplied by a single tube which was co-axial to the column, the decrease in oxygen concentration was recorded, and oxygen measurements were then used to determine the mass transfer coefficients to describe the rate of oxygen transfer from solution. Superficial, average, sparging velocities of 2, 5, and 10 mm/second were applied to each of the liquids at three different column fill levels, and mass transfer coefficient test results are presented here for combinations of superficial velocities and fluid levels...|$|E
40|$|Gas holdup {{tests were}} {{performed}} in bench-scale and small-scale mechanically-agitated mixing systems at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) for a simulant of waste from the Hanford Tank 241 -AZ- 101. These featured additions of DOW Corning Q 2 - 3183 A <b>anti-foam</b> <b>agent.</b> Results {{indicated that this}} <b>anti-foam</b> <b>agent</b> (AFA) increased gas holdup in the waste simulant by about a factor of four and, counter-intuitively, that the holdup increased as the non-newtonian simulant shear strength decreased (apparent viscosity decreased). Such results raised the potential of increased flammable gas retention in Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) vessels mixed by air sparging and pulse-jet mixers (PJMs) during a Design Basis Event (DBE). Additional testing was performed {{to determine the effects}} of simulant properties, composition of alternate AFAs, and presence of trace noble metals. Key results are that: (1) Increased gas holdup resulting from addition of Q 2 - 3183 A is due to a decrease in surface tension that supports small bubbles which have low rise velocities. (2) Dow Corning 1520 -US AFA shows it to be a viable replacement to Dow Corning Q 2 - 3183 A AFA. This alternative AFA, however, requires significantly higher dosage for the same anti-foam function. (3) Addition of noble metals to the AZ- 101 waste simulant does not produce a catalytic gas retention effect with the AFA...|$|E

30|$|The SBR {{made of a}} {{plexiglass}} cylinder (15  cm inner diameter) has {{an effective}} volume of 3.6  L. The reactor was started with suspended biomass from an activated sludge process treating municipal wastewater (Gaobeidian WWTP, Beijing, China). The initial concentration of volatile suspended solids (VSS) in the SBR was ~ 4.0  g/L. Each cycle of the SBR operation is 12  h, consisting of a feeding phase with stirring (30  min), an anoxic phase (3  h and 30  min), an aerobic phase (7  h), a settling phase (30  min), and effluent withdrawal (30  min). The effluent was withdrawn at a constant depth of 7  cm below the initial water level. The air flow rate in the aerobic phase was maintained at 8  L/min. The solid retention time (SRT) was maintained at 20  days by wasting 5 % of the mixed liquor at the aerobic phase every day. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) was kept constant at 1.5 days, and the exchanged volume per cycle is 1.2  L, i.e. 1 / 3 of the liquid volume in the reactor. The dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH were measured but not controlled. There was a start-up period of {{three weeks before the}} commencement of regular water quality analysis (day 0), during which the reactor was fed with 4 times (× 1 / 4) diluted wastewater (Table  1). During the first 42  days of the experiment, the SBR was fed with 4 times diluted effluent from the aforementioned precipitation reactor, then the dilution was reduced to 2 times (× 1 / 2) in the subsequent 26  days. From 69  day onwards, the influent SBR was the precipitation reactor effluent without dilution. An <b>anti-foam</b> <b>agent</b> (Kebio RT 500, Beijing, China), as suggested by (Tuantet et al. 2014), was added into the influent (0.025 %, v/v) to prevent excessive foams in the aerobic phase.|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of River Protection’s Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) will {{process and}} treat {{radioactive}} waste that {{is stored in}} tanks at the Hanford Site. The waste treatment process in the pretreatment facility will mix both Newtonian and non-Newtonian slurries in large process tanks. Process vessels mixing non-Newtonian slurries will use pulse jet mixers (PJMs), air sparging, and recirculation pumps. An <b>anti-foam</b> <b>agent</b> (AFA) {{will be added to}} the process streams to prevent surface foaming, but may also increase gas holdup and retention within the slurry. The work described in this report addresses gas retention and release in simulants with AFA through testing and analytical studies. Gas holdup and release tests were conducted in a 1 / 4 -scale replica of the lag storage vessel operated in the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) Applied Process Engineering Laboratory using a kaolin/bentonite clay and AZ- 101 HLW chemical simulant with non-Newtonian rheological properties representative of actual waste slurries. Additional tests were performed in a small-scale mixing vessel in the PNNL Physical Sciences Building using liquids and slurries representing major components of typical WTP waste streams. Analytical studies were directed at discovering how the effect of AFA might depend on gas composition and predicting the effect of AFA on gas retention and release in the full-scale plant, including the effects of mass transfer to the sparge air.

5000|$|Foam, in {{this case}} meaning [...] "bubbly liquid", is also {{produced}} as an often-unwanted by-product {{in the manufacture of}} various substances. For example, foam is a serious problem in the chemical industry, especially for biochemical processes. Many biological substances, for example proteins, easily create foam on agitation or aeration. Foam is a problem because it alters the liquid flow and blocks oxygen transfer from air (thereby preventing microbial respiration in aerobic fermentation processes). For this reason, <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agents,</b> like silicone oils, are added to prevent these problems.
