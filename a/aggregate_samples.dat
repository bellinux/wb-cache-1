40|$|The {{shape of}} the {{aggregate}} particles used has significant effects on {{the properties of the}} concrete produced.

In order to study how the various shape parameters of aggregate particles would affect the packing of aggregate, <b>aggregate</b> <b>samples</b> of different rock types from different sources have been analysed for their shape characteristics using a newly developed digital image processing technique and their packing densities measured in accordance with an existing method given in the British Standard.

40|$|Introduction: Soil erosion {{by water}} {{is the most serious}} form of land {{degradation}} throughout the world, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. In these areas, soils are weakly structured and are easily disrupted by raindrop impacts. Soil erosion is strongly affected by different factors such as rainfall characteristics, slope properties, vegetation cover, conservation practices, and soil erodibility. Different physicochemical soil properties such texture, structure, infiltration rate, organic matter, lime and exchangeable sodium percentage can affect the soil erodibility as well as soil erosion. Soil structure {{is one of the most}} important properties influencing runoff and soil loss because it determines the susceptibility of the aggregates to detach by either raindrop impacts or runoff shear stress. Many soil properties such as particle size distribution, organic matter, lime, gypsum, and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) can affect the soil aggregation and the stability. Aggregates size distribution and their stability can be changed considerably because of agricultural practices. Information about variations of runoff and sediment in the rainfall events can be effective in modeling runoff as well as sediment. Thus, the study was conducted to determine runoff and sediment production of different aggregate sizes in the rainfall event scales. Materials and Methods: Toward the objective of the study, five aggregate classes consist of 0. 25 - 2, 2 - 4. 75, 4. 75 - 5. 6, 5. 6 - 9. 75, and 9. 75 - 12. 7 mm were collected from an agricultural sandy clay loam (0 - 30 cm) using the related sieves in the field.

30|$|The {{viscosity}} {{estimation error}} for G 0.34 was approximately 63 % in Table  5, and the sample gave the highest water absorption—more than {{double that of}} the other samples—as reported in Table  2. The following experiment was designed to verify that the water absorption generates error of the viscosity estimation. Two samples, G 0.45 and G 0.34, were compared. The difference in their water absorption was 3.50 %, but their packing densities were very similar, 0.633 and 0.626, respectively. Simply adding 3.50 % absorbed water to the S 60 sample allows it to maintain same solid volume fraction as G 0.45. After the absorption rate was corrected for G 0.34, the value in parentheses, the rheology parameters and difference to the predicted values were added in Table  5. The prediction of rheological properties was possible at 0.34  mm of the fine <b>aggregate</b> <b>sample</b> size, while the workability difference was observed as smaller than 0.89  mm of the fine <b>aggregate</b> <b>sample</b> size. Therefore, it can be concluded that workability decreases with decreasing particle mean size and is only influenced by water absorption in a range from 0.34 to 0.89  mm. Considering the water absorption effect keeps the Krieger–Dougherty model valid, the hydrodynamic state of the mortar samples is consistent in the range of aggregate size.|$|R
