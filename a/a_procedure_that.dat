5|$|U-1 {{had several}} {{features}} typical of Lake's designs, including a diving chamber under {{the bow and}} two variable pitch propellers. Lake's design also called for two retractable wheels that allowed travel over the seabed. The design also placed the diving tanks above the waterline of the single, cylindrical hull, which necessitated a heavy ballast keel for vertical stability. This arrangement required mechanical pumping, <b>a</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> took 8 minutes. U-1s propulsion system consisted of two gasoline engines for surface running and two electric motors for running while submerged.|$|E
5|$|Allen's {{exploits}} {{in those}} years {{introduced him to the}} wrong side of the justice system, which would become a recurring feature of his life. In one incident, he and his brother Heman went to the farm of a neighbor, some of whose pigs had escaped onto their land, and seized the pigs. The neighbor sued to have the animals returned to him; Allen pleaded his own case, and lost. Allen and Heman were fined ten shillings, and the neighbor was awarded another five shillings in damages. He was also called to court in Salisbury for inoculating himself against smallpox, <b>a</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> at the time required the sanction of the town selectmen.|$|E
5|$|E. When Jos Verstappen stalled his {{car on the}} grid, Race Director Charlie Whiting {{attempted}} to abort the start, <b>a</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> is carried out when a car is stalled before the lights go out. However, {{the lights went out}} before he had the chance to do so, and as a result the lights afterwards displayed the standard 5 red lights and 3 amber lights. The race was immediately stopped, but the red flag was not displayed until the cars came to the start/finish line. As is the case when a start is aborted, the race was shortened by one lap as the cars were not refuelled, but Verstappen was allowed to regain his original grid position in 15th.|$|E

5|$|In 1929â€“30, ill-health {{restricted}} Jackson to {{just five}} first-class matches and five innings for Balmain. Despite his health, Jackson {{had a successful}} season, and scored 168 not out against Arthur Gilligan's English team, which toured Australia briefly en route to New Zealand. He {{was seen as an}} automatic selection for the 1930 Ashes tour of England. He confirmed his selection with 182 in a Test trial, an innings regarded by many as the best he had ever played. Another scare with illness saw him hospitalised in Adelaide after the Christmas match against South Australia, missing the next two state matches. His health problems continued after an operation to remove his tonsils; <b>a</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> was arranged by the Australian Board of Control despite Jackson never having previously suffered any problems with his tonsils. Bill Ponsford had suffered from tonsillitis during the previous tour and the Board were anxious to avoid similar occurrences. Complications resulting from the operation saw Jackson lose a stone (6.4 kilograms) in weight.|$|E
5|$|Pleurodesis is <b>a</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> {{permanently}} {{eliminates the}} pleural space and attaches the lung {{to the chest}} wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E

25|$|Paul Ehrlich was a {{bacteriologist}} studying staining, <b>a</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> {{is used in}} many microscopic {{studies to}} make fine biological structures visible using chemical dyes. As Ehrlich injected some of these dyes (notably the aniline dyes that were then widely used), the dye stained all of the organs of some kinds of animals except for their brains.

25|$|An {{algorithm}} {{is said to}} take linear time, or O(n) time, if its time complexity is O(n). Informally, this means that for large enough input sizes the running time increases linearly {{with the size of}} the input. For example, <b>a</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> adds up all elements of a list requires time proportional to the length of the list. This description is slightly inaccurate, since the running time can significantly deviate from a precise proportionality, especially for small values of n.|$|E
25|$|Electrocautery is {{available}} {{as an alternative}} to laser cautery. Electrocautery is <b>a</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> uses a light electrical current to burn moles, skin tags, and warts off the skin. Electric currents are set to a level such that they only reach the outermost layers of the skin, thus reducing the problem of scarring. Approximately 1-3 treatments may be needed to completely remove a mole. Typically, a local anesthetic is applied to the treated skin area before beginning the mole removal procedure.|$|E

25|$|Since {{transmission}} electron goniometry {{is based}} on Braggâ€™s Law for the transmission (Laue) case (diffraction of electron waves), interzonal angles (i.e. angles between lattice directions) can be measured by <b>a</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> {{is analogous to the}} measurement of interfacial angles in an optical goniometer on the basis of Snellâ€™s Law, i.e. the reflection of light. The complements to interfacial angles of external crystal faces can, on the other hand, be directly measured from a zone-axis diffraction pattern or from the Fourier transform of a high resolution TEM image that shows crossed lattice fringes.|$|E

Madonna Swan {{was one of the first}} patients to undergo this new procedure and much was learned about the treatment of TB from her experiences. Following the successful removal of lung and ribs, they were able to treat her remaining lung with an antibiotic designed to kill the TB bacteria (INH, Isoniazid).|$|E

25|$|In 1900, Hilbert posed {{a famous}} list of 23 {{problems}} for the next century. The first two of these were to resolve the continuum hypothesis and prove the consistency of elementary arithmetic, respectively; the tenth was to produce a method that could decide whether a multivariate polynomial equation over the integers has a solution. Subsequent work to resolve these problems shaped the direction of mathematical logic, as did the effort to resolve Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem, posed in 1928. This problem asked for <b>a</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>that</b> would decide, given a formalized mathematical statement, whether the statement is true or false.|$|E
