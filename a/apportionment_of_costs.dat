40|$|This thesis {{documents}} as {{a historical}} continuum {{the relationship between the}} Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD), the nation???s largest water district by population served, and the San Diego County Water Authority (SDCWA), MWD???s largest water purchaser among its 26 member agencies. That association has been marked over the years by alternating cooperation and conflict driven by perceived self-interest. As single purpose special districts with appointed directors and the power to raise their own revenues, MWD and SDCWA operate under less public scrutiny than general jurisdiction governments and have largely ignored competing societal interests in the pursuit of their mission to provide an adequate water supply for a growing population. Although they are united by a common goal, the differing positions of SDCWA and other MWD member agencies, particularly the city of Los Angeles, have led to decades-long battles over the need for and means of acquiring new water supplies and transmission facilities, the allocation of existing supplies, and the <b>apportionment</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs.</b> Those issues intensified beginning in the 1960 s as environmentalism and growing water demands throughout the West made the water districts??? job more difficult and complex. As complexity and contentiousness increased, so did the role of agency staff, which assumed policy roles that had heretofore been the sole purview of part-time boards of directors. After drought curtailed water supplies in the early 1990 s, a dissatisfied SDCWA began an ultimately successful effort to acquire a large additional water supply outside the MWD sphere, fundamentally altering {{the relationship between the two}} agencies.

40|$|Research PaperThis paper {{outlines}} {{the process and}} impact of a phased introduction of cost recovery on the Victorian wild and aquaculture sectors and the framework for tracking and delivering data outputs to a co-management fisheries management structure. In order to determine whether efficient and effective {{development and use of}} fisheries resources is occurring, all costs associated with these activities must be identified and appropriately apportioned. An integral part of these costs include Fisheries Management Services (FMS) usually delivered by publicly funded Fisheries Management Agencies (FMA’s). FMS refers to a range of services provided by a FMA that supports the management of public (wild resources) and private (aquaculture) fisheries resources. FMS are best assessed on an activity basis (activity based costing) with the <b>apportionment</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> associated with these services based upon estimated costs and benefits to particular beneficiary groups. Fisheries Victoria has developed a computerised logging and data management system. The community’s interest (including intergenerational concerns) must be met by state stewardship. Being a public good, the FMS costs associated with this responsibility should be fully funded from the tax base. On the other hand, costs associated with FMS that directly benefit private entities for private gain are being recovered by FMA’s around the world to varying degrees of sophistication and degree. The recovery of these costs are usually in the form of levies or fees on licence holders. The economic costs associated with the increases in fisheries management levies are {{in the form of a}} short-term increase in enterprise costs and decreased returns. Concurrent with these impacts is the restructuring of fishing sectors as industry adjustment processes takes place...|$|E

As principais críticas estão relacionadas ao rateio dos custos indiretos, considerado arbitrário. Em se tratando do custeio baseado em atividades, sua aplicabilidade também é de fácil realização considerando que o setor público já trabalha com a definição de atividades. Busca-se, a partir desta metodologia, a integração entre as áreas envolvidas, minimizando recursos e maximizando resultados. O custeio baseado em atividades requer mais tempo para a implementação, o que o torna também mais oneroso.

40|$|Published online: 14 Jan 2014 International audienceIn {{the context}} of new {{challenges}} and emerging needs for transparency regarding users, urban water management is obliged to forge links between different technical fields. This implies managing interfaces between multiple stakeholders on the one hand, and ensuring the adaptability and sustainability of technical infrastructures on the other hand. In a period dominated by public spending cuts, the optimisation and efficiency of the system's infrastructures and the organisation of the stakeholders involved has become important for guaranteeing {{the continuity of the}} services provided. From the economic viewpoint, this challenge is related to tracking and reducing costs. Moreover, it also concerns the need to communicate arguments related to service costs to both users and stakeholders. Consequently, the "Eco-EAR" method was developed by adapting Functional Analysis (FA), Activity Based Costing (ABC) and Whole Life Costing (WLC) approaches in view to describing how the direct costs of the sewerage service provided by wastewater utilities are structured. The cost structure is analysed according to the activities and physical flows comprising the primary and secondary functions of an urban water management system. Three goals are targeted: i) to explain the costs of the system to the local authority (owners) and users; ii) to identify the activities that have the greatest impact on costs in order to plan cost reduction actions; and iii) to assess the <b>apportionment</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> per activity and per physical flow, in order to better understand the system by combining both its economic and technical dimensions. The performance indicators proposed by the "Eco-EAR" method could also be used for benchmarking. The method is implemented in a real case study: the sub-system territory around the city of Mulhouse (northeast France) under the responsibility of a water management authority...|$|E
40|$|Background: Determining the <b>apportionment</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> {{of cancer}} care and {{identifying}} factors that predict costs {{are important for}} planning ethical resource allocation for cancer care, especially in markets where managed care has grown. Design: This study linked tumor registry data with Medicare administrative claims to determine the costs of care for breast, colorectal, lung and prostate cancers during the initial year subsequent to diagnosis, and to develop models to identify factors predicting costs. Subjects: Patients with a diagnosis of breast (n= 1, 952), colorectal (n= 2, 563), lung (n= 3, 331) or prostate cancer (n= 3, 179) diagnosed from 1985 through 1988. Results: The average costs during the initial treatment period were $ 12, 141 (s. d. =$ 10, 434) for breast cancer, $ 24, 910 (s. d. =$ 14, 870) for colorectal cancer, $ 21, 351 (s. d. =$ 14, 813) for lung cancer, and $ 14, 361 (s. d. =$ 11, 216) for prostate cancer. Using least squares regression analysis, factors significantly associated with cost included comorbidity, hospital length of stay, type of therapy, and ZIP level income for all four cancer sites. Access to health care resources was variably associated with costs of care. Total R 2 ranged from 38 % (prostate) to 49 % (breast). The prediction error for the regression models ranged from > 1 % to 4 %, by cancer site. Conclusions: Linking administrative claims with state tumor registry data can accurately predict costs of cancer care {{during the first year}} subsequent to diagnosis for cancer patients. Regression models using both data sources may be useful to health plans and providers and in determining appropriate prospective reimbursement for cancer, particularly with increasing HMO penetration and decreased ability to capture complete and accurate utilization and cost data on this population.

40|$|The energy, {{water and}} {{environment}} nexus {{is a crucial}} factor when considering the future development of desalination plants or industry in the water-stressed economies. New generation of desalination processes or plants has to meet the stringent environment discharge requirements and yet the industry remains highly energy efficient and sustainable when producing good potable water. Water sources, either brackish or seawater, have become more contaminated as feed while the demand for desalination capacities increase around the world. One immediate solution for energy efficiency improvement comes from the hybridization of the proven desalination processes to the newer processes of desalination: For example, {{the integration of the}} available thermally-driven to adsorption desalination (AD) cycles where significant thermodynamic synergy can be attained when cycles are combined. For these hybrid cycles, a quantum improvement in energy efficiency as well as in increase in water production can be expected. The advent of MED with AD cycles, or simply called the MEDAD cycles, is one such example where seawater desalination can be pursued and operated in cogeneration with the electricity production plants: The hybrid desalination cycles utilize only the low exergy bled-steam at low temperatures, complemented with waste exhaust or renewable solar thermal heat at temperatures between 60 and 80. °C. In this paper, the authors have reported their pioneered research on aspects of AD and related hybrid MEDAD cycles, both at theoretical models and experimental pilots. Using the cogeneration of electricity and desalination concept, the authors examined the <b>cost</b> <b>apportionment</b> <b>of</b> fuel <b>cost</b> by the quality or exergy of working steam for such cogeneration configurations...|$|R
40|$|Most papers propose {{extended}} producer responsibility (EPR) as {{an incentive}} for the future development of cleaner production processes. In this paper, we propose an EPR calculation method as an instrument to collect funds to offset past environmental degradations that occurred before environmental legislations were enforced. However, often an unfortunate side effect of EPR is the legal disputes over who should be considered liable. To solve that problem, we suggest a scientifically rigorous method that identifies liable economic agents and calculates the <b>apportionment</b> <b>of</b> restoration <b>costs</b> between producers responsible for direct environmental degradations and their intermediate and final consumers responsible for indirect degradations. We apply our method {{to the case of}} fish nurseries – a marine habitat – that have been continually destroyed by industrial harbours since the industrial revolution in the Seine estuary (France). Our EPR calculation method should diminish losses of profit per polluter caused by the restoration costs. Such diminution is expected to reduce lobby pressures responsible for lower environmental targets in environmental legislations. EPR is also expected to preserve harbor activities that contribute to the general interest and generate a positive externality for climate change mitigation, justifying restoration costs to be borne by a larger number of sectors than harbours alone. In the EPR restoration scenario involving polluters, users, users of users and final consumers, profit losses for the main destructors of habitats – harbours and the mining sector – reaches 12. 6 % and 6. 3 % respectively. For the other sectors, profit losses do not exceed 3. 4 % (estimated with an input-output model). info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
