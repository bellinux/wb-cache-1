40|$|The authors {{investigate}} {{the interplay between}} <b>answer</b> quality and <b>answer</b> speed across question types in community question-answering sites (CQAs). The research questions addressed are the following: (a) How do <b>answer</b> quality and <b>answer</b> speed vary across question types? (b) How do the relationships between <b>answer</b> quality and <b>answer</b> speed vary across question types? (c) How do the best quality <b>answers</b> and the fastest <b>answers</b> differ in terms of <b>answer</b> quality and <b>answer</b> speed across question types? (d) How do trends in <b>answer</b> quality vary over time across question types? From the posting of 3, 000 questions in six CQAs, 5, 356 <b>answers</b> were harvested and analyzed. There {{was a significant difference}} in <b>answer</b> quality and <b>answer</b> speed across question types, and there were generally no significant relationships between <b>answer</b> quality and <b>answer</b> speed. The best quality <b>answers</b> had better overall <b>answer</b> quality than the fastest <b>answers</b> but generally took longer to arrive. In addition, although the trend in <b>answer</b> quality had been mostly random across all question types, the quality of <b>answers</b> appeared to improve gradually when given time. By highlighting the subtle nuances in <b>answer</b> quality and <b>answer</b> speed across question types, this study is an attempt to explore a territory of CQA research that has hitherto been relatively uncharted...|$|R

She may have represented her son and played a role in meetings and <b>answering</b> queries; however, the final authority on legal matters was Caracalla. When Caracalla was murdered, Julia was in Antioch sorting out correspondence, removing unimportant messages from the bunch so that when Caracalla returned, he would not be overburdened with duties.

40|$|Along {{with the}} {{proliferation}} of the social web, question and <b>answer</b> (QA) sites attract millions of users around the globe. On these sites, users ask questions while others provide <b>answers.</b> These QA sites vary by their scope, size, and quality of answers; the most popular QA site is Yahoo! <b>Answers.</b> This chapter aims to examine the quality of information produced by the crowd on Yahoo! <b>Answers,</b> assuming that given enough eyeballs all questions can get good <b>answers.</b> Findings illustrate a process of <b>answer</b> quality improvement through crowd-sourcing questions. Improvement is achieved by having multiple <b>answers</b> to any given question instead of a singe <b>answer,</b> and through a mechanism of <b>answer</b> evaluation, by which users rank the best <b>answer</b> to any given question. Both processes contribute significantly to the quality of <b>answers</b> one can expect to find on Yahoo! <b>Answers...</b>|$|R
50|$|An <b>answer</b> {{given by}} a student is ruled correct or {{incorrect}} by the moderator. On short <b>answer</b> questions, if the <b>answer</b> given differs from the official one, the moderator uses his or her judgment to make a ruling (which is subject to a challenge by the competitors). On multiple choice questions, the <b>answer</b> given by the student is only correct if it matches the official <b>answer</b> exactly. Alternatively, the student may give the letter choice that corresponds to the correct <b>answer.</b> Although A, B, C, and D were once used as <b>answer</b> choice letters, W, X, Y, and Z are now favored due to a lower chance of confusion. On short <b>answers,</b> the <b>answer</b> {{does not have to}} exactly match the official <b>answer,</b> so any given <b>answer</b> that roughly means the same as the official <b>answer</b> is accepted.|$|R

5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} <b>answering</b> {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before <b>answering.</b> A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
