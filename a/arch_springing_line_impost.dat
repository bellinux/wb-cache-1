40|$|The {{following}} work aims {{to analyse}} {{and work out}} the issues relating to the widening of the hydraulic section of a two arched bridge in Sardinia. Its small hydraulic section proved to be insufficient and unable to drain an adequate quantity of water with the possible risk of dangerous flooding. In {{order to avoid the}} occurrence of such phenomena it is necessary to build a third reinforced concrete arch. Thus, we pulled down the right abutment of the original bridge and consequently we took the necessary safety measures through an innovative confinement system carried out as follows: • Driving in a line of micro-piles by each bridge pier wall and placing two 42 commercial sections {{at the level of the}} <b>arch</b> <b>springing</b> <b>line</b> tightly secured to the micro-pile line tied by means of Dywidag threaded bars. Through such device we needn’t use ribs so avoiding all the problems related to building underwater. Besides, building micropiles enabled the conversion of the original abutment of the pier bridge. • Pulling tensile the Dywidag bars by the springing levels of both arches. The main subject of this writing is the determination of the tie beam pre-tension force, having calculated the horizontal reaction to the <b>arch</b> <b>springing...</b>|$|R

50|$|Jacob Isett House and Store, {{also known}} as <b>Arch</b> <b>Spring</b> Farm, is a {{historic}} home and store building located at <b>Arch</b> <b>Spring,</b> Blair County, Pennsylvania. The property includes the Jacob Isett House (1805), store (1799), and summer kitchen; five wood frame outbuildings (c. 1870); and various archaeological remains. The house is a 2 1/2-story, seven bay, limestone dwelling in a vernacular Georgian style. Connected to the house is the one-story summer kitchen. The store is a two-story limestone building. The wood frame outbuildings are a wood shed, weigh shed, stable, barn, and implement shed. The archaeological site includes the remains of an integrated mill village.|$|R

50|$|The hall is an {{impressive}} two-storey height space with exposed timber trusses, clerestory lighting, a hardwood floor, and rendered masonry walls. The ceiling has exposed rafters and diagonal timber boards. The aisles are arcaded with <b>arches</b> <b>springing</b> from substantial square columns with square capitals and barley twists in the centre. Doorways to ancillary rooms are also arched. The aisles have raked timber boarded ceilings with exposed rafters. The mezzanine sits behind three <b>arches</b> <b>springing</b> from pilasters in the western wall, and has a wrought iron balustrade. The stage has timber partitions to rear, and behind the stage area is a gable wall with a three-light stained glass window. The clerestory windows have multi-coloured panes around their edges.|$|R

At each fifth rafter there are arch braced, scissor trusses that are tied at eaves level by metal rods. Each arched brace continues below {{the line of the}} clerestory and lands on a timber post. A second line of arches runs perpendicular to the roof trusses between the aisle posts {{along the length of the}} side aisles. These slender, pointed timber <b>arches</b> <b>spring</b> from moulded capitals on the aisle posts. The side aisle rafters also have arched bracing members in keeping with the truss bracing. The wide, gently pointed chancel <b>arch</b> <b>springs</b> from a timber moulding that runs around the sanctuary, forming a sill to the eastern windows.|$|R

50|$|Although {{each unit}} in an arch or vault is a voussoir, two units are of {{distinct}} functional importance: the keystone and the springer. The keystone {{is the center}} stone or masonry unit {{at the apex of}} an arch.

The start of the arch is emphasized by a molding 0.32 m in height. The rise of the arch is 12.02 m.|$|R
50|$|Many Gothic {{openings}} {{are based}} upon the equilateral form.
