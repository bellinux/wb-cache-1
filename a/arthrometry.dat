40|$|<b>Arthrometry</b> has an {{established}} {{role in the}} measure-ment of knee laxity in anterior cruciate ligament injury and following reconstruction. The role of rou-tine intraoperative <b>arthrometry</b> in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is poorly defined, and {{this study was designed}} to test the hypothesis that intra-operative <b>arthrometry</b> provides an objective method of documenting successful knee stabilisation follow-ing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. A consecutive cohort of 100 patients with unilateral isolated anterior cruciate ligament disruption were prospectively evaluated using a Rolimeter arthrome-ter. A maximal manual force method was utilised by a single examiner. This allowed for side-to-side com-parisons with the uninjured contralateral knee. Analysis of tibial translation was recorded preopera-tively with patients both awake and asleep, intraop-eratively following anterior cruciate ligament recon-struction, and postoperatively at 2 weeks and 3 months. Statistical analysis was performed using Spearman’s correlation coefficients. Intraoperative <b>arthrometry</b> of anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed knees revealed statistically significant correlation with measurements of un-injured knees (p < 0. 0001). These findings were reproducible at 2 weeks (p < 0. 0001) and at 3 months (p = 0. 0002). Based on our findings, we conclude that intraopera-tive <b>arthrometry</b> can be simple and provide repro-ducible results.

40|$|Nineteen {{patients}} with the clinical diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament injury were examined by KT- 1000 <b>arthrometry</b> before arthroscopy {{in an effort to}} differentiate partial from complete tears. To this end, the KT- 1000 arthrometer was equipped with a strain gauge and processor that permitted the required force to increase the anterior displacement by 1 -mm increments, to be read on a light-emitting diode. The measured force has been plotted against anterior displacement expressed in nonlinear increments along the x-axis to allow for the viscoelastic nature of the ligament. The results show that stress-strain diagrams of partially torn and completely torn ligaments are similar to those obtained by graded stress radiography. Using arthroscopy as the standard of measurement, partial tears can be differentiated from complete tears with a sensitivity of 80 % and a specificity of 100 %. The figures for complete tears versus partial tears are 100 % and 80 %, respectively. Graded <b>arthrometry</b> with x-y recording of the force-displacement relationship that allows for the viscoelastic qualities of ligament further extends the capabilities of instrumented <b>arthrometry.</b> Ligament testing devices are capable of objectively quantitating the clinical grading of knee joint laxity, particularly in {{patients with}} injury to the ACL...|$|E

40|$|Knee sleeves or braces {{represent}} auxiliary {{tools that}} have repeatedly {{been used by}} athletes, {{in an attempt to}} increase knee stability and, thus, reduce the risk of (recurrent) ligamentous injuries. Since ACL injuries typically occur in situations involving either torsion or hyperextension of the knee, it has been speculated that braces might protect the ACL by countering excessive anterior translation of the tibia with respect to the femur (Beynnon et al., 1997). However, the preponderance of in vivo studies to test this hypothesis was performed in cohorts of patients suffering from existent ligamentous (Branch et al., 1988; Colville et al., 1986) or other knee injury (Beynnon et al., 1997; Fleming et al., 2000). This complicates the extrapolation of results to healthy subjects. Further, the braces used in these studies were mostly rigid constructs that consisted of either uni- or bilateral hinged bars (Rishiraj et al., 2009). Such braces might hinder performance (Veldhuizen et al., 1991) and would be rejected by the vast majority of healthy athletes. For these reasons, we would like to use this letter to the editor to report the results of our experiments investigating whether a relatively light elastic knee sleeve would limit the degree of anterior tibial translation in computerized <b>arthrometry</b> tests as performed in a sample of non-injured subjects. We recruited ten female college students (age: 23. 4 ± 3. 2 yrs, height: 1. 68 ± 0. 05 m, mass: 59. 9 ± 5. 5 kg) who were free of acute or previous injury or any form of orthopaedic disease of the knee joints. The anterior displacement of the tibia was measured using the GNRB® computerized arthrometer (GeNouRob, Laval, France). With subjects lying in the supine position, the lower leg was firmly fixed with plastic caps mounted over the ankle joint and patella. An electrical pressure pad then exerted increasing pressure of up to 250 N on the calf, while a motion sensor, which was positioned on the ventral aspect of the shank, just distal of the patella, recorded the anterior displacement of the tibia. Displacements were continuously recorded but only the discrete values coinciding with 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 N were extracted for statistical analyses. The GNRB® system features a measurement accuracy of 0. 1 mm and {{has been shown to be}} a valid tool for measurements of anterior knee laxity (Jenny et al., 2013). To control inadvertent coactivation of hamstring muscles, which may bias the results of <b>arthrometry</b> measurements (Steele et al., 1994), the integrated electromyographic (EMG) activity of the biceps femoris and semitendinosus muscle was simultaneously recorded and normalized to additional recordings obtained during maximal voluntary contraction (MVC).

40|$|Previous in-vivo {{investigations}} on the stabilizing {{efficacy of}} knee bracing for ACL reconstructed patients have been often limited to 20 - 30 degrees of knee flexion. In this study, {{the effectiveness of}} a uniaxial hinged functional brace to improve the knee stability was assessed at 30, 60 and 90 degrees of knee flexion. <b>Arthrometry</b> tests were conducted on 15 healthy subjects before and following wearing the brace and the tibial displacements were measured at up to 150 N anterior forces.

The rate of effectiveness, however, was not consistent across the flexion range, e. g., 50 % at 30 degrees and only 4 % at 90 degrees. It was suggested that accurate sizing and fitting as well as attention to correct hinge placement relative to the femoral condyles can limit brace migration and improve its effectiveness in mid and deep knee flexion.

Our research work has indicated that Fisher kernels have shown substantial improvement in signal classification by enabling clearer pattern visualization in three-dimensional space.

Methods: the results from examinations carried out on 63 patients were analyzed. These patients were divided in two groups: one group of 30 patients who received a patellar tendon graft and another group of 33 patients who received a graft from the tendons of the semitendinosus and gracilis muscles.

Their average age was 26 years (16 to 43), with 27 males and 11 females. All patients had had MRI preoperatively. The same examiner performed the Lachman, anterior-drawer, and pivot-shift tests without anaesthesia, recording the differences between the injured and the normal knees. The patients then had KT- 1000 <b>arthrometry</b> by the same examiner at 15 lb (6. 8 kg) and 20 lb (9 kg), with active displacement, and with maximum manual displacement. All scored positive for differences greater than 3 mm. The results of physical examination, KT- 1000 tests and MRI were analysed using McNemar's test for matched data with continuity correction and a 95 % confidence interval for each test. The sensitivity of the KT- 1000 manual maximum test was 97 % for 3 mm and 100 % for 2 mm; this was the most useful arthrometric result. The Lachman test gave 95 % sensitivity, providing the best simple clinical assessment.

40|$|Kaminski, ThomasContext: Lateral ankle sprains are {{the most}} common {{injuries}} in high school sports. While ankle taping is a preferred method of external prophylactic support, its restrictive properties decline during exercise. The Under Armour® Highlight cleat is marketed on the premise that it provides added support without the need for additional ankle taping. Objective: To determine if differences in ankle joint laxity and postural control exist between football players wearing the Under Armour® Highlight cleat (Baltimore, MD) as compared to a low/mid-top cleat with ankle tape. Design: Crossover trial. Setting: Athletic training room and football practice field sideline. Patients: Thirty-two interscholastic football players (15. 8 ± 1. 0 yrs.; 178. 9 ± 7. 4 cm; 87. 1 ± 21. 4 kg). Interventions: Ankle laxity was assessed using an instrumented ankle arthrometer (Blue Bay Research Inc., Milton, FL), while balance testing was performed on the Tekscan MobileMat™ BESS (South Boston, MA). The two treatments included Under Armour® Highlight cleats and a low/mid-cut cleat with ankle tape applied to the non-dominant ankle only. Measurements were taken before and immediately after practice. Main Outcome Measures: The independent variable was treatment (Highlight vs low/mid with ankle tape). Dependent variables included ankle <b>arthrometry</b> measures of anterior displacement (mm), inversion/eversion rotation (deg); and the MobileMat™ BESS error scores. Single-leg foam and tandem foam stances were not performed. A linear mixed-effects model was used for analysis. Results: The mid/low-cut cleat with tape condition had significantly higher inversion range-of-motion (ROM) and inversion/eversion rotation post-exercise when compared to the Highlight cleat (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: The results of this study provide some evidence that the Under Armour® Highlight cleat restricts ankle ROM following a training session better than the taped low/mid-cut cleat.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} glenohumeral joint laxity and stiffness using instrumented <b>arthrometry.</b> To evaluate the validity of an instrumented measurement system we compared cutaneous and bone-pinned measures of laxity and stiffness that replicate previously reported in vivo methodology. Characterization of capsular laxity was achieved through determination of the sagittal plane translational area at increasing levels of quantified force. Finally, a method for increasing the objectivity of the standard manual laxity examination was developed for the orthopaedic clinician to quantify humeral head translation and capsular volume in vivo. We hypothesized that: 1) cutaneous measures could accurately predict bone-pinned measures, 2) capsular laxity would increase with increasing levels of applied force, and 3) manual cutaneous, manual bone-pinned, and force-displacement bone-pinned measures of translation would be equal. Thirty fresh frozen cadaveric shoulder specimens (mean age= 70 ± 14 years) were tested. The shoulders were thawed and mounted to a custom-made shoulder-testing apparatus. Displacement was measured using an electromagnetic tracking system. Sensors were secured cutaneously and with bone-pins to the scapula and humerus. Force-displacement testing was performed using a load applicator and manual displacement testing utilized the anterior/posterior drawer and inferior sulcus tests. A comparison of cutaneous and bone-pinned measures of laxity and stiffness revealed good to excellent criterion validity (r= 0. 68 to 0. 79). Examination of displacement measures at increasing levels of force revealed increasing capsular laxity with symmetric directional compliance. No significant difference was observed between anterior and posterior translation (0. 4 mm, p=. 55), with significant differences between inferior and anterior (4. 6 mm, p<. 0001) and between inferior and posterior (5. 1 mm, p<. 0001). A comparison of manual cutaneous to bone-pinned manual and kinetic measures of translation revealed a significant difference between methods (p=. 0024) and between directions (p<. 0001) with no significant interaction (p=. 0948). Estimations of the force required to achieve clinical end-point suggest that greater force is required in the anterior (173 N) direction compared to posterior (123 N) and inferior (121 N).

40|$|Kaminski, ThomasContext: Lateral ankle sprains {{commonly}} {{occur within}} the athletic population. However, athletes who sustain one ankle sprain {{have a higher}} risk of recurrent episodes that frequently lead to chronic ankle instability (CAI). CAI is a multifactorial diagnosis that includes mechanical and functional instability components. Mechanical instability generally includes ligamentous laxity, whereas functional instability includes neuromuscular aspects and strength. However, the impact of laxity and CAI on ankle strength remains un. Objective: To compare ankle strength (PF, DF, INV and EV) measurements in athletes who have mechanical laxity and who present with reported chronic ankle instability after a history of unilateral ankle sprains. Design: Retrospective study. Participants: 165 participants including 97 males and 68 females (height = 178. 01 cm, weight = 78. 7 kg, age = 18. 5 years). Interventions: An injury history questionnaire and Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) were administered to determine the number of previous ankle sprains and the presence of self-reported CAI. Laxity of the ankle joint was determined using a portable ankle arthrometer measuring anterior displacement in millimeters and inversion rotation in degrees. Strength was measured using a Kin Com isokinetic dynamometer and peak torque for the four different ankle motions were recorded. Main Outcome Measures: The independent variable was group status as determined by either (1) ankle instability (CAIT scores) and (2) ankle laxity (<b>arthrometry</b> measurement). The dependent variables are peak torque strength measures, concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) in two velocities (30 °/sec & 120 °/sec), in all ankle motions. Results: 24 subjects (14. 54 %) had both anterior and INV/EV laxity and 74 of the 165 participants (44. 84 %) had self-reported CAI in their injured ankle. The laxity group presented with less PF CON strength at 30 °/sec (t=- 2. 567, p=. 011) and EV CON strength at 120 °/sec (t=- 2. 137, p=. 034) {{than those who did not}} have laxity. A trend toward significance was seen for ECC (t=- 1. 905, p=. 059) and CON PF at 120 °/sec (t=- 1. 852, p=. 066). No significance was found between those with or without CAI and their strength measurements. Conclusion: Plantar flexion and eversion strength was significantly less in those without laxity compared to their contralateral, uninjured ankle, exhibiting a need for specific rehabilitation of the specific muscle groups. Even though no significant differences were found with CAI, significance was found with gender and right versus left ankle, exposing that our understanding of CAI as a diagnosis and its relationship with strength is not fully understood.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionClinical {{diagnosis}} of {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) tears (Lachman test and Pivot shift test in valgus and internal rotation) is reliable in case of complete ACL tear but reveals elusive in case of partial tears. Quantitative assessment of anterior tibial translation proves to be imprecise, subjective and poorly reproducible especially with the KT- 1000 arthrometer. We developed the GNRB®, an alternative original anterior knee laxity measurement device. The lower limb is placed in a rigid support with the knee at 0 ° of rotation, the restraining power being recorded. A 0 – 250 N thrust force is transmitted by a jack to the upper segment of the calf. This force is only applied {{in the absence of}} hamstring muscles contraction. Displacement of the anterior tibial tubercle is recorded using a sensor with a 0. 1 mm precision. HypothesisWe hypothesize that this knee laxity measurement device is more reliable and reproducible than other currently available arthrometers. Material and methodsDuring a first validation study, the GNRB® was compared to the KT- 1000 arthrometer, in 20 pairs of healthy knees, measurements being performed by two investigators. Variance analyses were carried out at 134  N. In a second clinical study, 21 complete ACL tears (the notch is devoid of ACL) and 24 partial ACL tears (anterior or posterior bundle tear and cicatricial ACL remnant in continuity) were tested with these arthrometers to exact a differential laxity threshold value between both knees at 250  N. Statistical analysis was subsequently performed using variance and ROC curves analysis. ResultsThe GNRB® arthrometer reveals to be significantly more reproducible than the KT- 1000, irrespectively of the tester's experience level. Moreover, unlike the KT- 1000, the achieved measurement is independent from the uninvolved side. Reproducibility of laximetry proves to be significantly better with the GNRB® than with the KT- 1000, wherever the examiner's experience stands and whatever the evaluated side condition could be. When differential laxity threshold value was 3 mm in complete ACL tears, sensitivity was 70 % and specificity 99 % at 134  N. Using a 1. 5 mm threshold value in ACL partial tears, the arthrometer sensitivity was 80 % and specificity was 87 % at 134  N. DiscussionReproducibility of laximetry was significantly better with the GNRB® than the KT- 1000 device, wherever the examiner's experience stands and whatever the evaluated side-condition could be. The GNRB® reports various supplementary advantages compared with other available laximeters. Good control of the investigated limb position in rotation, recording of translation in the absence of hamstring muscles contraction and in direct comparison with the KT- 1000 : reproducibility, constant pressure, <b>arthrometry</b> improved accuracy and automated measurements recording. The GNRB® might be used for {{diagnosis of}} partial and complete ACL tears and during follow-up of reconstructed or not ACL tears. Level of evidence: type II. Prospective comparative stud...|$|E

The patients were randomised between ACL reconstruction performed with the use of autogenous patellar-tendon graft or a weaker autogenous graft that was augmented with a polypropylene braid. At follow-up after 4 and 7 years, respectively, we found no statistical difference in stability tests, functional or activity scores. Both groups showed stable improvement concerning scores and <b>arthrometry</b> compared to preop. No advantage was found with the addition of the LAD. In a prospective study on ten patients with a bone-patellar tendon-bone reconstruction, tibia condyle bone mineral density (BMD), bone ingrowth and changes in diameter in the tibia bone tunnel was studied by quantified computed tomography postoperatively and after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. There was no sign of bone ingrowth in the bone tunnels. The tunnel diameter initially increased. After 1 year 5 patients had a smaller, 2 patients had the same and 2 patients had a bigger diameter compared to postoperative examination. There was a decrease in tibia condyle BMD at 3 months, after 12 months BMD had increased but was not restored completely. We concluded that: Autogenous bone-tendon-bone grafts is not, after one year, incorporated into the tibia-tunnel by bone ingrowth into the central tendon part of the graft. Although the patients were rehabilitated according to an accelerated protocol they showed the same amount of bone mineral loss as reported in patients with inactivity/posttraumatic induced osteopenia. Seventeen out of 22 patients reconstructed with the Gore-Tex prosthetic ligament were evaluated after 14 years. They were evaluated with the KT- 1 000 arthrometer, CT scans of the tibia-tunnel, IKDC, Lysholm and Tegner scores, pivot shift, Lachman test and visual analogue scale (VAS) score for pain. We found osteolytic enlargement in the tibia-tunnel in 14 of the examined 17 patients. Our study showed that all osteolysis are not symptomatic and can not be detected with evaluation scores, clinical or arthrometric exams. The 80 acute and chronic patients in the 2 first studies were evaluated 14 years after reconstruction. Follow-up protocol was the same with the addition of IKDC score, radiological examination with weight bearing anteroposterior and lateral projections of the knee and quantified computed tomography (QCT) of the tibiatunnel. In this long-term follow-up we found no adverse reactions to augmentation and it is equal to the patellar tendon technique in maintaining achieved stability over time, therefore {{it seems to be a}} safe complement if a graft of inadequate strength has to be used. LAD and chronic injuries was associated with more tibia- tunnel expansions compared to PT and acute injuries. PT reconstructions had a tendency towards more patella-/femoral joint degeneration. Chronic injuries had significantly more arthrotic changes and lower Lysholm score...|$|E
40|$|Meniscal {{tears are}} among the most common {{injuries}} treated in Orthopaedic Surgrey. The aim of this dissertation is to evaluate a new, all-inside, meniscus repair technique. Between January 1997 and December 2002, 73 patients underwent meniscus repair using the Meniscus Arrow. Sixty three patients were treated in the Orthopaedic Department of “Agios Pavlos’’ General Hospital and 10 patients were treated in the Orthopaedic Department of Democritus University of Thrace. All meniscal tears were unstable, vertical, longitudinal in the red-red or red-white zone. Seventeen patients had an isolated meniscal tear (ACL intact group) and 56 patients had concomitant ACL deficiency. In 45 patients the ACL was reconstructed (ACL reconstructed group). The reconstruction of the ACL was performed at the same time with the meniscus repair. Central third bone patella tendon bone (BPTB) autograft was used for ACL reconstruction in 24 patients and semitendinosus/gracilis (ST/G) autograft was used in 21 patients. Eleven patients elected not to undergo ACL reconstruction due to the prolonged rehabilitation protocol (ACL-deficient group). All patients were treated with an all-inside technique using a bioabsorbable meniscus refixation device (Meniscus Arrow), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and the technique described by Albrecht-Olsen et al. The study population consisted of 56 male and 17 female patients. The average patient’s age at the time of surgery was 24 years (14 - 39). Time from suspected injury to repair ranged from 0 weeks to 14 weeks with a mean of 6. 42 weeks. There were 66 medial and 7 lateral tears. Forty four tears were located in the red-red zone and 29 in the red-white zone. The length of the tear averaged 2. 22 cm (1 - 4) and the mean number of arrows, used per meniscus to accomplish the repair, was 3. 2 (1 - 7). Postoperatively, all patients followed similar, non-accelerated rehabilitation protocol. At a mean follow-up of 73 months (49 - 96), the average pretraumatic Tegner activity score decreased from 6. 71 (3 - 10) to 6 (3 - 10) postoperatively, the mean Lysholm score was 94. 4 (74 - 100) and the mean subjective IKDC score was 81. 9 (67. 8 - 100). KT- 2000 <b>arthrometry</b> demonstrated that sagittal knee laxity was {{less than or equal to}} 3 mm in all 45 reconstructed knees and more than 5 mm in all ACL-deficient knees, compared to the healthy side. Failure was defined as the need of rearthroscopy and partial meniscectomy. There were 6 failures, making a total failure rate of 8. 2 %. Three failures occurred in patients with stable knee (4. 8 %) and 3 failures occurred in patients with unstable knee (27. 3 %). Of the successful repairs, 41 knees were graded overall as A (normal), 20 as B (nearly normal) and 6 as C (abnormal), according to the IKDC knee examination form. There were no infections in the patients reviewed. One patient (1. 4 %) from the ACL reconstructed group, developed arthrofibrosis that resolved with medication and physiotherapy. Soft tissue irritation at the refixation site from the Meniscus Arrows was observed in 4 patients (5. 5 %). In 3 patients transient pain or tenderness were obtained and symptoms gradually resolved, without any surgical intervention, within 4 months. One patient complained for intermittent local pain and dysesthesia related to knee flexion, due to saphenous infrapatellar branch irritation. He had a medial meniscus tear repaired with two 13 -mm and one 16 -mm arrows. The arrow tip was cut off under local anesthesia and the symptoms resolved (inappropriate arrow size). Effusion was obtained in 6 patients (8. 2 %) 1 - 12 months postoperatively and resolved spontaneously within 4 - 12 months postoperatively. There were no serious neurovascular complications. In the ACL-deficient group, all patients were asymptomatic during daily activities but 7 out of 8 reported pain or effusion after sports. The Tegner activity score decreased at least two levels in all patients, except one. All patients in this group reduced their level of physical activity and could maintain good clinical outcome. Nevertheless, none of the patients had an excellent clinical result. Two of the patients were rated as B (nearly normal) and 6 patients were rated as C (abnormal). Factors that affected the healing rate in this study were the stable knee, localization of tear in the red-red zone, tear length (< 2 cm), lateral meniscus tears and concomitant ACL reconstruction. Meniscus repair with sutures have documented more than 10 years favourable outcomes and remains the standard technique to which all other techniques must be compared. ...|$|E
