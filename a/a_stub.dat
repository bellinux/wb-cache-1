5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to <b>a</b> <b>stub,</b> in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can {{with a hole in}} the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|MD7 crosses North East Creek {{and enters}} the town of North East, where the highway is known as Cecil Avenue. The highway intersects MD272, which follows a one-way pair, Main Street {{southbound}} and Mauldin Avenue northbound. MD7 leaves the town and passes through a forested area with scattered residences. The route passes through an S-curve during which it crosses to {{the north side of}} the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. On {{the north side of the}} bridge is <b>a</b> <b>stub</b> of old alignment, MD7H. MD7 continues east, passing Old Elk Neck Road before turning north and reaching its eastern terminus at US40. The roadway continues beyond the intersection as MD279 (Elkton Road).|$|E
5|$|Route958 {{was first}} {{designated}} among many regional highways in the 1928 mass renumbering of state highways throughout Pennsylvania. The alignment, however was only <b>a</b> <b>stub</b> designation, connecting the southern terminus of U.S. Route6 (formerly State Route7) to the borough of Wrightsville, {{only a short}} distance away. The alignment designed in 1928 only remained intact eight years into 1936, when it was extended northward to its current terminus at the New York state line near Bear Lake, Pennsylvania and Niobe, New York in 1936. The alignment has remained unchanged since the 1936 extension.|$|E
50|$|A {{decision}} {{condition is}} constructed with <b>a</b> condition <b>stub</b> and <b>a</b> condition entry. <b>A</b> condition <b>stub</b> is declared as {{a statement of}} a condition. A condition entry provides a value assigned to the condition <b>stub.</b> Similarly, <b>an</b> action (or decision) composes two elements: <b>an</b> action <b>stub</b> and <b>an</b> action entry. One states an action with <b>an</b> action <b>stub.</b> An action entry specifies whether (or in what order) the action is to be performed.|$|R

5|$|St Saviour's Church {{served the}} southwestern part of Round Hill until 1981. The flint and brick building, set {{below the level}} of Ditchling Road and on its west side, was in the Early English Gothic Revival style and was meant to have a tower; only <b>a</b> <b>stub</b> was ever built. The architects were Edmund Scott and F.T. Cawthorn. An {{extension}} was built in 1889, and in 1904 a large reredos designed by Richard Herbert Carpenter and W. Slater was moved to the church from Chichester Cathedral. Congregations declined, and the church was demolished in 1983; flats called St Saviour's Court and a rear archway in Vere Road recall its existence.|$|E
5|$|Another {{very common}} {{component}} of distributed element filters is the stub. Over {{a narrow range}} of frequencies, <b>a</b> <b>stub</b> {{can be used as}} a capacitor or an inductor (its impedance is determined by its length) but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator. Short-circuit, nominally quarter-wavelength stubs (figure 3(a)) behave as shunt LC antiresonators, and an open-circuit nominally quarter-wavelength stub (figure 3(b)) behaves as a series LC resonator. Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex filters and, as would be expected from their resonant nature, are most useful in band-pass applications. While open-circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies, they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal open circuit (see figure 4(b)), often leading to a preference for short-circuit stubs (one can always be used in place of the other by adding or subtracting λ/4 to or from the length).|$|E
5|$|Route 58 is {{a former}} state highway {{in the city of}} Newark, New Jersey and nearby borough of Harrison, New Jersey. The highway ran from Orange and Hecker Streets in Newark, {{eastbound}} as a four-lane freeway across the William A. Stickel Memorial Bridge (known as the Stickel Bridge) to Harrison, where it terminated at an intersection with County Route 508. The route originates as an alignment of Route 25A, a suffixed spur designated in 1939 of State Highway Route 25. The route was rechristened as Route 58 in the 1953 state highway renumbering. The highway was constructed into Interstate 280 in the 1950s, and the route persisted internally until the 1990s, when it was finally removed as a designation. <b>A</b> <b>stub</b> alignment of Route 58 remains near Hecker and Orange Streets.|$|E

The presented antenna, simply consisting of <b>a</b> circular-arc-shaped <b>stub,</b> <b>an</b> L-shaped <b>stub,</b> <b>a</b> microstrip feed line, and a rectangular ground plane has a compact size of 16 mm × 38. 5 mm and {{is capable of}} generating three separate resonant modes with very good impedance matching.

5|$|Another common {{low-pass}} design {{technique is}} {{to implement the}} shunt capacitors as stubs with the resonant frequency set above the operating frequency so that the stub impedance is capacitive in the passband. This implementation has a lumped-element counterpart of a general form similar to the filter of figure 6. Where space allows, the stubs may be set on alternate sides of the main line {{as shown in figure}} 7(a). The purpose of this is to prevent coupling between adjacent stubs which detracts from the filter performance by altering the frequency response. However, a structure with all the stubs on the same side is still a valid design. If the stub is required to be a very low impedance line, the stub may be inconveniently wide. In these cases, a possible solution is to connect two narrower stubs in parallel. That is, each stub position has <b>a</b> <b>stub</b> {{on both sides of the}} line. A drawback of this topology is that additional transverse resonant modes are possible along the λ/2 length of line formed by the two stubs together. For a choke design, the requirement is simply to make the capacitance as large as possible, for which the maximum stub width of λ/4 may be used with stubs in parallel on both sides of the main line. The resulting filter looks rather similar to the stepped impedance filter of figure 5, but has been designed on completely different principles. A difficulty with using stubs this wide is that the point at which they are connected to the main line is ill defined. <b>A</b> <b>stub</b> that is narrow in comparison to λ can be taken as being connected on its centre-line and calculations based on that assumption will accurately predict filter response. For a wide stub, however, calculations that assume the side branch is connected at a definite point on the main line leads to inaccuracies as this is no longer a good model of the transmission pattern. One solution to this difficulty is to use radial stubs instead of linear stubs. A pair of radial stubs in parallel (one on either side of the main line) is called a butterfly stub (see figure 7(b)). A group of three radial stubs in parallel, which can be achieved at the end of a line, is called a clover-leaf stub.|$|E

50|$|Radial <b>stubs</b> are <b>a</b> planar {{component}} {{that consists of}} a {{sector of a circle}} rather than a constant-width line. They are used with planar transmission lines when <b>a</b> low impedance <b>stub</b> is required. Low characteristic impedance lines require a wide line. With a wide line the junction of the stub with the main line is not at a well defined point. Radial stubs overcome this difficulty by narrowing to a point at the junction. Filter circuits using stubs often use them in pairs, one connected to each side of the main line. A pair of radial stubs so connected is called <b>a</b> butterfly <b>stub</b> or <b>a</b> bowtie <b>stub.</b>|$|R
