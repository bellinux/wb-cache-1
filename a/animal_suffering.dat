5|$|Thus, Palmer {{argues that}} humans are not {{normally}} required to aid wild animals in need. The philosopher Joel MacClellan, a critic of intervention, challenges Palmer on three grounds: first, {{he says that the}} difference between our obligations to domestic and wild animals in Palmer's thought experiments could be justified on scientific, rather than moral, grounds; second, he challenges Palmer's characterisation of wildness as a relationship, rather than a capacity, arguing that a description of an animal as wild likely conveys that the animal has certain capacities lacked by domestic animals; and, third, he suggests that just as a utilitarian approach to wild <b>animal</b> <b>suffering</b> may demand too much, Palmer's contextual approach may permit too much, by allowing the policing of nature. The affinities between utilitarian and contextualist approaches, MacClellan argues, come from their shared idea of what is and is not valuable. The pro-intervention philosopher Catia Faria criticises Palmer's argument from the other direction. Faria challenges Palmer's account by pointing to the counter-intuitive conclusions it would reach, Faria claims, in cases of assisting humans with whom an individual does not have significant relationships. Unless Palmer is willing to deny that humans have obligations to help suffering distant humans, Faria argues, the account cannot justify not aiding animals.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{differences}} between a vegan and a typical vegetarian diet is the avoidance of both eggs and dairy products such as milk, cheese, butter, and yogurt.

40|$|Biomedical {{researchers}} are making efforts at treating severe eye diseases by transplanting retinal progenitor cell layers. Transplantation of retinal progenitor cell layers {{can help in}} preventing severe eye diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration. Several studies have revealed that such transplantations can help in treating <b>animals</b> <b>suffering</b> from retinal degeneration. These studies revealed that transplanting intact sheets of immature retinal cells can improve vision of <b>animals</b> <b>suffering</b> from eye diseases. Researchers state that eye disease patients can be treated effectively and their vision improved, when the diseased cells are replaced and the new cells can connect appropriately with the functional part of the retina...|$|R
25|$|Many {{effective}} altruists {{believe that}} reducing <b>animal</b> <b>suffering</b> {{should be a}} major priority and that, at the current margin, there are cost-effective ways of accomplishing this. Peter Singer quotes estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the British organization Fishcount according to which 60 billion land animals are slaughtered and between 1 and 2,7 trillion individual fish are killed each year for human consumption. He argues that effective animal welfare altruists should prioritize factory farming over more overfunded popular causes such as pet welfare. Singer also argues that, if farm animals such as chickens are assigned even a modicum of consciousness, efforts to reduce factory farming (for example, by reducing global meat consumption) could be an even more underfunded and cost-effective way of reducing current global suffering than human poverty reduction. Philosophically, wild <b>animal</b> <b>suffering</b> may be an additional moral concern for effective altruists.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., the no-kill concept {{received}} a legal boost in 1998 {{when the state}} of California passed three pieces of legislation directed to reduce <b>animal</b> <b>suffering</b> at shelters in California: the Vincent Law, which requires shelters to spay or neuter animals prior to adoption; the Hayden Law, which requires that animals work with rescue groups; and the Kopp Law, which prohibited the use of carbon monoxide to euthanize animals. No-Kill shelters {{received a}} financial boost {{with the establishment of}} Maddie's Fund in 1999, from which a number of communities in the United States have since received millions in financial grants.|$|E
25|$|The main {{difference}} between a vegan and vegetarian diet is that vegans exclude dairy products. Ethical vegans avoid them {{on the premise that}} their production causes <b>animal</b> <b>suffering</b> and premature death. In egg production, most male chicks are culled because they do not lay eggs. To obtain milk from dairy cattle, cows are made pregnant to induce lactation; they are kept lactating for three to seven years, then slaughtered. Female calves are separated from their mothers within 24 hours of birth, and fed milk replacer to retain the cow's milk for human consumption. Male calves are slaughtered at birth, sent for veal production, or reared for beef.|$|E

25|$|Scientific {{publications}} {{have made}} it clear since the 1980s that the majority of researchers do believe animals suffer and feel pain, though it continues to be argued that their suffering may be reduced by an inability to experience the same dread of anticipation as humans, or to remember the suffering as vividly. The problem of <b>animal</b> <b>suffering,</b> and animal consciousness in general, arose primarily because it was argued that animals have no language. Singer writes that, if language were needed to communicate pain, it would often be impossible to know when humans are in pain, though we can observe pain behavior and make a calculated guess based on it. He argues that {{there is no reason to}} suppose that the pain behavior of nonhumans would have a different meaning from the pain behavior of humans.|$|E
500|$|Still, a {{wide range}} of {{viewpoints}} exist. The view that animals have moral rights (animal rights) is a philosophical position proposed by Tom Regan, among others, who argues that animals are beings with beliefs and desires, and as such are the [...] "subjects of a life" [...] with moral value and therefore moral rights. Regan still sees ethical differences between killing human and non-human animals, and argues that to save the former it is permissible to kill the latter. Likewise, a [...] "moral dilemma" [...] view suggests that avoiding potential benefit to humans is unacceptable on similar grounds, and holds the issue to be a dilemma in balancing such harm to humans to the harm done to animals in research. In contrast, an abolitionist view in animal rights holds that there is no moral justification for any harmful research on animals that is not to the benefit of the individual animal. Bernard Rollin argues that benefits to human beings cannot outweigh <b>animal</b> <b>suffering,</b> and that human beings have no moral right to use an animal in ways that do not benefit that individual. Another prominent position is that of philosopher Peter Singer, who argues that there are no grounds to include a being's species in considerations of whether their suffering is important in utilitarian moral considerations. Malcolm Macleod and collaborators argue that most controlled animal studies do not employ randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding outcome assessment, and that failure to employ these features exaggerates the apparent benefit of drugs tested in animals, leading to a failure to translate much animal research for human benefit.|$|E

Personal accounts from people who knew Hitler and were familiar with his diet indicate that he did not consume meat as part of his diet during this period, with several contemporaneous witnesses—such as Albert Speer (in his memoirs, Inside the Third Reich)—noting that Hitler used vivid and gruesome descriptions of <b>animal</b> <b>suffering</b> and slaughter at the dinner table to try to dissuade his colleagues from eating meat.|$|E
