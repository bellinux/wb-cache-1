30|$|Agricultural {{production}} {{depends upon}} various and interconnected factors (e.g., crop genetics, agronomic management practices, the environment under which it dynamically responds to maximize crop growth potential and survival). Recent {{findings from the}} inter-comparison and validation of agricultural crop models indicate that the prediction of crop yield over time and space is highly variable and, in turn, the relative responses to climate shocks predicted by models can widely disagree (Nelson et al. 2014). Such variability pose substantial uncertainty and risks {{in the use of}} agricultural sustainability decision-making frameworks that include crop yield as a leading metric. To address this problem, decision analytics can play a vital role by guiding the use of statistical-based analytics to build in a higher degree of intelligence to enable better predictive (i.e., crop yield forecasting both over the growing season and inter-annually) and prescriptive (optimization across crop areas and subdivisions) approaches. While inter-annual variability in yield can be modelled under various deterministic trends with stochastic variation, quantifying the variability of yield and how it changes across different spatial resolutions remains a major knowledge gap. In some studies, field data is available and is used to train and validate a crop model. In other <b>applications,</b> <b>regional</b> estimates of crop yield mean and variance is measured by sampling a randomly determined subset of fields within a region, without sampling all fields.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the great}} {{interest}} in regional modeling for both weather and climate <b>applications,</b> <b>regional</b> modeling is not yet at the stage {{that it can be}} used routinely and effectively for climate modeling of the ocean. The overarching goal of this project is to transform how climate models are used by developing and implementing a robust, efficient, and accurate global approach to regional ocean modeling. To achieve this goal, we will use theoretical and computational means to resolve several basic modeling and algorithmic issues. The first task is to develop techniques for transitioning between parameterized and high-fidelity regional ocean models as the discretization grid transitions from coarse to fine regions. The second task is to develop estimates for the error in scientifically relevant quantities of interest that provide a systematic way to automatically determine where refinement is needed in order to obtain accurate simulations of dynamic and tracer transport in regional ocean models. The third task is to develop efficient, accurate, and robust time-stepping schemes for variable spatial resolution discretizations used in regional ocean models of dynamics and tracer transport. The fourth task is to develop frequency-dependent eddy viscosity finite element and discontinuous Galerkin methods and study their performance and effectiveness for simulation of dynamics and tracer transport in regional ocean models. These four projects share common difficulties and will be approach using a common computational and mathematical toolbox. This is a multidisciplinary project involving faculty and postdocs from Colorado State University, Florida State University, and Penn State University along with scientists from Los Alamos National Laboratory. The completion of the tasks listed within the discussion of the four sub-projects {{will go a long way}} towards meeting our goal of developing superior regional ocean models that will transform how climate system models are used...|$|E

Because of its sequential nature, the Kalman filter methodology yields a very fast software implementation, which {{can be applied to}} the SEVIRI full disk for off-line analysis.

40|$|The {{importance}} of different additional simplifications used when moving from single site <b>applications</b> to <b>regional</b> <b>applications</b> of the SAFE and MAKEDEP models was studied. The SAFE {{model is a}} dynamic soil chemistry model, which apart from physical and chemical soil parameters also needs the historic evolution of atmospheric deposition and nutrient uptake to simulate the effects of acidic deposition on the chemical status of forest soils. The historic evolution of atmospheric deposition and nutrient uptake are reconstructed by the MAKEDEP model, using information on current deposition and nutrients status together with general deposition trends. Additional simplifica- tions are enforced by limitations in available regional data sets and the costs involved in completing regional data sets. The simplifications studied here {{are the same as}} those used in an actual <b>regional</b> <b>application</b> to Scania, southern Sweden: (1) Use of default values for certain soil parameters such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and soil bulk density; (2) Use of general depth trends to extrapolate soil parameters, such as mineralogy and surface area, measured for one soil layer to the other three soil layers considered in the SAFE model application; (3) Use of a simplified version of MAKEDEP, where some of the key feedbacks, such as the effects of a growing canopy on dry deposition rates have been removed in order to limit the input data needed to run the MAKEDEP model. The models where applied to two well documented sites, Solling, Germany and Rothamsted, UK. Model results using the above simplifications and subsets thereof were compared with soil chemistry measurements and model results based on previously published single-site applications for the two sites. The study shows that the trends and the present day values of pH and base cation concentration are reproduced fairly well even when all of the simplifications are used. In order to increase the reliability of the <b>regional</b> <b>applications,</b> however, the non-simplified version of MAKEDEP should be used rather than the simplified version.
