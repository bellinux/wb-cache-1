500|$|Agnew was {{involved}} in a minor controversy regarding an appearance by Lily Allen on Test Match Special in 2009. The Daily Telegraph reported that [...] "the cricket-loving Allen struck up an instant rapport with Agnew, and the BBC received largely positive feedback for the 30-minute interview", but Will Buckley, writing for The Observer, described Agnew's [...] "amorous ambitions" [...] as [...] "positioned... firmly on the pervy side of things". Agnew was furious, noting he [...] "gave... Will Buckley 24hrs to apologise for calling me a pervert, and he has declined... <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine,</b> I have taken being called a pervert quite badly." [...] Allen herself supported Agnew: [...] " [...] really think this Will Buckley guy should apologise to... he was nothing but kind and gentlemanly to me during our interview. I don't know 1 person that agrees with The Observer on this one." [...] Buckley eventually apologised.|$|E

For this record, Melua {{went back to her}} native Georgia to record an album with the Gori Women's Choir, a native Georgian all-woman singing troupe. Melua revealed during an interview with The Guardian that her partnership with Mike Batt had come to an end after her last album, as it was a six-album deal with Batt's Dramatico records. [...] "It was a six-album deal,” she explains, “so when the sixth one was done, you know – it was finished and it was time for us to part ways.....It was maybe a bit more mutual on one side than the other. Yeah – it wasn’t easy, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine.</b> And I'm still incredibly proud of the work we did together. But it had to happen and I think it has been mutual ... um, eventually." ...|$|E

500|$|In March 2016, Marvel {{revealed}} which characters {{will appear}} on the opposing factions. They also revealed two spin-off series: Civil War II: Spider-Man from writer Christos Gage and artist Travel Foreman, and [...] Civil War II: X-Men from writer Cullen Bunn and artist Andrea Broccardo. Bunn explained, [...] "This tale is set into motion by the same catalyst that sets 'Civil War II' into motion. A new power emerges among the Inhumans. This power, in Magneto's eyes, could be very dangerous to the mutant population, so—in typical Master of Magnetism fashion—he decides to take it for himself. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine,</b> something like that could very easily start a war between the Inhumans and the mutants. Storm sees this and decides to stand in Magneto's way." [...] In Civil War II: Amazing Spider-Man, Spider-Man helps a precognitive Inhuman use his powers responsibly. [...] "Over the course of the miniseries, the Inhuman will make a prediction that, while not of the world-or universe-ending variety, could well mean the end of one character's world. It's really dealing with classic Spider-Man themes: power and responsibility; facing a situation where even if you win, you can also lose -- or you can just lose," [...] Gage elborated.|$|E

While appearing on Loose Women the previous year, Havers {{revealed that he}} had been in talks with Coronation Street producers about a return to the show. He stated that he had adored his role as Lewis and that he had to return and apologise to Audrey. Later that year, ITV announced that Havers would return to Coronation Street in 2012 to reprise his role as Lewis. Series producer Phil Collinson said that Havers had started filming his scenes in January 2012 and he would return on-screen from February. Collinson also said that Lewis would have a lot of ground to cover to win Audrey back, that the character is [...] "a great hoot" [...] and that it was wonderful to have Havers back. Peter Dyke and Katie Begley of the Daily Star wrote that [...] Lewis' return storyline would show Audrey and her daughter, Gail Platt (Helen Worth), unexpectedly meeting Lewis at a country pub. Havers told Allison Jones of Inside Soap that Lewis then tries to convince them he is his own twin brother, Hugh. Havers said, [...] "Audrey is totally floored to see him again— <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine.</b> And if I said that Gail is angry when they bump into Lewis, it would be a massive understatement!" [...] Lewis begs Audrey and Gail not to call the police and he decides to return to Weatherfield.|$|E

The following month, Paramount Pictures announced a casting search for a 12- to 16-year-old girl, describing the character as a [...] "simple, tough as nails young woman" [...] whose [...] "unusually steely nerves and straightforward manner are often surprising". Steinfeld, then age 13, was selected for the role from a pool of 15,000 applicants. [...] "It was, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> probably <b>imagine,</b> the source of a lot of anxiety", Ethan Coen told The New York Times.

Oh, believe me, sir, that it was all good! All that a father's heart could hope or wish for! It was all loyal!

2500|$|A patch was {{released}} September 9, 2010 to fix {{issues in the}} game. [...] Players can no longer use collision glitches with the world geometry {{to find ways to}} cheat on the game's leaderboards.

The patch also decreases the amount of time to wait on players who do not finish multiplayer races. [...] Vector Unit later removed glitched times from the game's leaderboards in November 2010. When asked {{about the possibility of a}} PlayStation 3 port of the game, the company stated [...] "People ask us this all the time, and unfortunately the answer is no.

60|$|We {{went through}} this {{exceedingly}} pretty house and its gardens with melancholy interest. The first is merely a pavilion in the Italian taste, though it is about half {{as large as the}} President's House, at Washington. I should think the Great Trianon has quite twice the room of our own Executive residence; and, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> well <b>imagine,</b> from what has already been said, the Capitol itself would be but a speck among the endless edifices of the chateau. The projection in the centre of the latter is considerably larger than the capitol, and it materially exceeds that building in cubic contents. Now this projection is but a small part indeed of the long line of façade, it actually appearing too short for the ranges of wings.|$|R

Howie B explained, [...] "The main groove is actually just Larry's hi-hat, {{but it sounds like}} a mad engine running or something really crazy – about as far away from a hi-hat <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine...</b> the task in 'Miami' was to make it unlike anything else on the album, and also unlike anything else you'd ever have heard before." [...] Edge also comes in with a frenetic guitar riff and Bono's affected vocal style singing about Miami in metaphors and descriptions of loud, brash Americana. D. Leurssen described it as a [...] "sonic travelogue," [...] while the Edge termed it [...] "creative tourism." [...] In 2005, Q magazine included the song [...] "Miami" [...] in a list of [...] "Ten Terrible Records by Great Artists". However, Andrew Unterberger of Stylus Magazine acknowledged the inclusion of the song in Q's list and said [...] "I’m pretty sure they gave this album some super-glowing review when it was first released, so clearly they’re not to be trusted in the first." ...|$|E

I have been over the outhouses intended to be devoted to the reception of the various sections, both here and at the Boot-jack and Countenance, and am much delighted with the arrangements.

Some were big and red and ugly,--as ugly <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> possibly <b>imagine,</b> with blue faces and fiercely grinning teeth; others were delicately-formed and sad of countenance, {{as if they were}} for ever bewailing the loss of near and dear relations, and could by no means come at consolation; and some were small and pretty, with faces no bigger than a halfpenny.

Miss Birmingham and I saw, among other things, a very pretty brass-bound chest being thrown about like a feather. On Tuesday night, the unhappy Ostend packet could not get in, neither could she go back, and she beat about the Channel until noon yesterday.

If a row was to be had anywhere within walking distance he {{was the sort of}} fellow to be in it. When he came to his senses he found himself lying in his bunk, and the 'Susan Pride'--if that {{was the name of the}} ship; I think it was--ten miles out to sea. The Captain declined to put the vessel about to please either a loving seaman or a loving seaman's wife; and to come to the point, the next time Mr. Tom Sleight saw Mrs. Tom Sleight was seven years later at the American bar of the Grand Central in Paris; and then he didn't know her." ...|$|R

I ran alongside a fishing-boat, therefore, and ordered them to give up their papers. Unfortunately they had none, except a rag of an evening paper, which was full of nothing but betting news. In a second attempt I came alongside a small yachting party from Eastbourne, who were frightened to death at our sudden appearance out of the depths. From them we were lucky enough to get the London Courier of that very morning.|$|E

"If you love nature, {{live in the}} city" (Glaeser, 2011). As the first quote above suggests, the proponents of Landscape Urbanism have been winning design competitions and commissions, as well as gaining professional and academic acclaim. Closely associated with hallowed ecological values, it {{has been given a}} wide berth in the media and public process. However, it has received limited analysis and criticism in the professional and academic worlds. New Urbanism, on the other hand, is an older and more organized movement whose agenda has been repeatedly dissected and critiqued. A critical comparison of the two is illuminating and timely in an era of increasing ecological degradation and climate disruption, as well as of rapid urbanization. Before comparing the two, the environmental merits and demerits of urbanism in general will be discussed...|$|R

Now, one of these Kings, named DERMOND MAC MURROUGH (a wild kind of name, spelt in more than one wild kind of way), had carried off the wife of a friend of his, and concealed her on an island in a bog. The friend resenting this (though it was quite the custom of the country), complained to the chief King, and, with the chief King's help, drove Dermond Mac Murrough out of his dominions. Dermond came over to England for revenge; and offered to hold his realm as a vassal of King Henry, if King Henry would help him to regain it. The King consented to these terms; but only assisted him, then, with what were called Letters Patent, authorising any English subjects who were so disposed, to enter into his service, and aid his cause.|$|R
