Introduction 	In response to the challenges posed by an aging population, countries all over the world are currently considering, or may have already enacted, fundamental structural reforms of their Social Security Pension programs. Demographic trends and other pressures on these programs are expected to increase sharply in coming decades. In particular, the looming retirement of the babyboom generation, declines in fertility rates, and increases in longevity are projected to cause a significant increase in the old-age dependency ratio: the ratio of retirees to the working-age population. 	 Social Security is considered one of the United States' most successful government programs. Despite its success in helping millions of senior Americans avoid poverty, it faces a long-term deficit and policymakers have been considering changes to address these problems. The Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare systems (programs including age-related social expenditures); continue to stress the <b>actuarial</b> <b>deficits</b> of both systems in face of the imminent retirement of the baby-boom generation and pressures on health care costs. Moreover, the erosion of the U. S. fiscal situation since 2001 (when projections were for large surpluses and the elimination of public debt by 2009); and the re-emergence of budget deficits have revived concerns regarding the impact of these demographic trends on the longer-term fiscal position. 	 This paper describes the Social Security system in the United States, discusses the state of the program today and the challenges ahead. Part I is an overview of the federal programs that are part of the social security system and provide support for the elderly, as well as of employersponsored and private pension plans.

By the end of 1996, the Social Security trust fund had accumulated about $ 566 billion in assets and was expected to grow to over $ 1. 2 trillion by 2010. However, longer-term projections suggest that Social Security will face financial shortfalls. Using intermediate assumptions, the Social Security Trustees ’ Report (1997) projects that benefit payments will exceed program revenue (payroll tax receipts plus interest income) beginning in 2019.

40|$|The President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security {{proposed}} three reform plans. Two, analyzed here, restore {{actuarial balance}} {{in the absence of}} individual accounts. One achieves this balance solely through benefit reductions. The other uses new dedicated revenue to cover one-third of the <b>actuarial</b> <b>deficit,</b> reducing benefits to close the rest. Both plans cut disability and young survivor benefits in step with retirement benefits, while bolstering benefits for long-career low earners and surviving spouses with low benefits. The plans both include voluntary individual accounts that replace part of the scaled-back Social Security system. Payroll taxes are diverted to the accounts and one of the plans also requires a (subsidized) add-on contribution for those choosing accounts. Under both models, any payroll tax deposited in an individual account is also recorded in a 'liability account' for the worker. The liability account tracks the diverted payroll revenue (with interest) and is paid off by reducing traditional benefits. The individual accounts are subsidized through a sub-market interest rate on the liability accounts. This subsidy worsens the financial position of the Trust Fund. The accounts also create a cash-flow problem. Consequently, by themselves, the individual accounts make Social Security's solvency problems worse both in the short run and over the long run. To offset the adverse impact of the accounts, the plans call for large transfers of general revenues (despite substantial projected budget deficits). If all (two-thirds of) eligible workers opted for the accounts, the new revenues required over the next 75 years would amount to between 1. 2 and 1. 5 (0. 8 and 1. 1) percent of payroll. Holding the disabled harmless from the benefit reductions would raise the required transfers to between 1. 5 and 1. 7 (1. 1 and 1. 3) percent of payroll (compared to a projected <b>actuarial</b> <b>deficit</b> of 1. 9 percent of payroll under current law). Despite requiring this much general revenue relative to paying scheduled benefits, the plans would produce significant reductions in expected combined benefits. At the end of 75 years, however, assets in the accounts would amount to between 53 and 66 (35 and 44) percent of GDP, and the value to Social Security of the accumulated liabilities that reduce later benefits would amount to more than 20 (15) percent of GDP. ...|$|E

The model provides a straightforward explanation of the paradox that the demand for medical services is rising, even though medical price inflation is faster than non-medical price inflation. We use this model to prepare 75 -year medical spending projections and compare our projections with forecasts based on an older method widely used by government and private actuaries and economists. As part of this comparison, we compute the implications for the medical share of total output and the financial status of the Medicare program. Our baseline forecast predicts slower health spending growth in the long run relative to the older projection methodology. Also, while the 75 -year <b>actuarial</b> <b>deficit</b> of the Medicare program implied by our model is similar to that implied by the older methodology, our results suggest that over time our model would predict a lower deficit relative to the older methodology...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the financial}} impact of Social Security by age cohort under alternative assumptions concerning future financing of Social Security. It examines the Social Security Administration's intermediate IIB and various combinations of optimistic and pessimistic assumptions concerning fertility, mortality, and wage growth. Importantly, it examines {{the implications of}} alternative potential resolutions of the long-term financing deficit and scenarios concerning the planned systematic deviation from pay-as-you-go finance in the retirement and disability funds. The {{results suggest that the}} Social Security retirement program offers vastly different returns to households in different circumstances, and especially to different cohorts. Most important, if Social Security does not maintain the large retirement trust fund surplus currently projected for the next 30 years, alternative scenarios for return to pay-as-you-go finance differ dramatically in the taxes, benefits, transfers, and real rates of return that can be offered to different birth cohorts. The implications of cutting taxes, raising benefits or diverting the surplus to other purposes have dramatic impact on the overall financial status of the system, the time pattern of taxes, benefits and surpluses or deficits, and therefore, the treatment of different age cohorts. Under the intermediate assumptions, the OASDI surplus is projected to grow almost as large as a fraction of GNP as the current ratio of privately held national debt to GNP. For example, if the OASDI surplus is used to raise benefits, and they remained at higher levels thereafter {{during the height of the}} baby-boom generation's retirement, the long-run <b>actuarial</b> <b>deficit</b> will zoom from $ 500 billion to over $ 3 trillion. Correspondingly, if benefits increase, financed by the OASDI surplus over the next 30 years, the expected rate of return on lifetime contributions increases for those currently about 40 years old from 1. 9 % to 2. 7 %, about a 40 % increase. Correspondingly, if the surplus is dissipated and the subsequent long-run deficit is made up with a tax increase on a pay-as-you-go basis at the time of the projected deficit, the rate of return relative to the intermediate assumptions for those persons now being born will fall by about 158, and in this case, the overall system finances would move from a long-run <b>actuarial</b> <b>deficit</b> of slightly under one-half percent of taxable payroll to actuarial balance. Thus, as Social Security is projected to deviate systematically from pay-as-you-go finance, the potential alternative scenarios with respect to accruing the surplus and/or dissipating it in various ways have potentially large intergenerational redistribution effects. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{view that}} faster wage growth would improve Social Security's financial condition rests on several {{measures of the}} program's finances that the Social Security trustees emphasize in their annual reports. These measures include annual cash-balance ratios, the 75 - year <b>actuarial</b> <b>deficit,</b> the "crossover date," and the "trust fund - exhaustion date. " All of these measures show that Social Security's financial condition would improve if future wage growth were faster. This conventional view also suggests that the trustees' relatively conservative assumptions about future wage growth cause the program's financial imbalance to be overstated. Unfortunately, the measures highlighted in the trustees' annual reports have a short-term orientation that biases calculations toward showing an improvement under faster wage growth. The connection between wage growth and Social Security's finances should be evaluated using measures that are free of a short-term bias. This Policy Analysis evaluates the connection under the more comprehensive infinitehorizon "fiscal imbalance" measure. It uses simple cases of the program's operation to explore {{the impact of the}} relevant forces [...] population aging, wage growth, discount rates, and the projection horizon. It shows that although faster wage growth is desirable in and of itself to increase general prosperity, it would likely worsen Social Security's overall financial condition.

40|$|Government {{spending}} on the elderly is projected to increase rapidly as the American population becomes older. As a result, many policymakers and budget analysts {{are concerned about the}} continued viability of entitlement programs such as Social Security. The Social Security trustees' economic growth projections receive considerable attention because many people believe that higher growth would significantly improve the program's actuarial balance (that is, reduce its <b>actuarial</b> <b>deficit).</b> This belief is validated by Social Security trustees' calculations that show larger 75 -year actuarial balances under faster assumed real wage growth rates. Since 2003 the trustees have reported the program's actuarial balance measured in perpetuity. But they do not provide sensitivity analysis that examines the impact of various assumptions on the infinite-term actuarial balance. This paper shows analytically that faster wage growth may reduce Social Security's infinite-term actuarial balance if the ratio of workers to retirees continues to decline rapidly beyond the 75 th year. This result holds even if the decline in that ratio ceases after just two decades beyond the 75 th year. The paper reports stylized calculations of the impact of real wage growth and demographic changeincluding time-varying rates of change based on official projections for the U. S. economyon Social Security's actuarial balance in a multi-period setting. Finally, the Social Security and Accounts Simulator (SSASIM) actuarial model of Social Security financing is used to estimate the degree to which increased wage growth could negatively affect the system's infinite-term actuarial balance. These results raise questions about the conventional wisdom that holds that improved wage growth would affect Social Security's financing, and how a widely used measure of Social Security's financing captures those effects...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{provides}} a framework for the conceptualization, definition and estimation of legacy costs {{that need to be}} addressed in a reform that transforms an unfunded defined contribution (NDB) scheme into a notional (or non-financial) defined contribution (NDC) scheme. As the new contribution rate is fixed and, perhaps, reduced, paying for the accrued to date liabilities leaves a financing gap that needs to be covered. The paper comes to the following key conclusions: (i) to render an NDC reform credible and fully effective in its desired results, it is crucial to determine the legacy costs of the reformed system – no matter how these costs will be financed; (ii) for a shift from an NDB scheme to a full NDC scheme with a fixed and long-term-sustainable contribution rate the legacy costs simply amounts to the <b>actuarial</b> <b>deficit</b> at the time of reform and is finite; (iii) different sources of the legacy deficit may be differentiated, in particular inherited legacy costs reflecting prior reforms and benefits above the steady-state under the old scheme; and reform-induced new legacy costs due to the shift toward a lower sustainable contribution rate; (iv) to estimate legacy costs, actuarially and macro-economically based projection models have advantages over pure actuarial studies, as they are less dependent on very technical parameter assumptions that may not be consistent with general equilibrium considerations; (v) distributive effects play both at the intergenerational and intra-generational level, as benefits and costs of the reform are borne unequally by different subgroups of the current and future population; (vi) in the developing world, one promising way to finance the legacy costs is the use of an increased coverage to strengthen the PAYG asset; (vii) for developed countries, theoretical models show that tax financing in particular via indirect taxes such as VAT is an interesting tool, but empirical limitations tend to dampen the real-world usefulness...|$|E
40|$|While the short-run {{financial}} status of Social Security is secure, its long-run {{financial status}} is very uncertain. The retirement and disability {{part of the}} system (OASDI) is projected to be in long-run <b>actuarial</b> <b>deficit</b> under the Social Security Administration's intermediate economic and demographic f 9 recasts. Hospital Insurance (HI) is projected to run a large deficit, beginning in the 1990 s. OASDI is projected to accrue a very large surplus over the next thirty years, peaking at almost 30 % of GNP. Social Security has never accrued a surplus this large; it may well be dissipated for other purposes, such as to bail out HI, fund other programs, raise benefits, or cut taxes. These alternatives may affect net national saving, directly because Social Security surpluses or deficits are part of government sector saving and indirectly through effects on private saving or the non-Social Security part of the federal government budget. This paper documents how various systematic deviations from, or return to, pay-as-you-go finance of the Social Security system may affect net national saving. For example, under base case assumptions with respect to the non-Social Security deficit, a constant net private saving rate of 6 %, and long-run budget balance in the state and local government sector, the Social Security deficit offsets 40 % of other net national saving over the Social Security Administration's 75 -year projection period. In the first 25 -year sub-period, the Social Security surplus adds one-sixth to other net national saving; in the second, it offsets almost one-half; and in the third, it offsets five-sixths of other net national saving. Of course, private saving may respond to changes in Social Security's funding as may the non-Social Security balance in the federal budget. The paper presents several alternative scenarios such as benefits increasing or taxes falling during the OASDI surplus period, various stylized rules concerning the non-Social Security budget deficit, and separate balancing of HI via outlay reductions or tax increases. The results indicate that OASDI may effect net national saving substantially. For example, if benefits ratchet up during what would have been the period of the OASDI surplus, the OASDI system may subsequently offset virtually all of remaining net national saving. On the other hand, if HI is brought into balance and the OASDI surplus is allowed to accrue, Social Security will offset only about 4 % of other net national saving. Changes in private saving may accentuate or ameliorate the swings in the net national saving rate generated by the future financing of OASDHI, but the alternative financing options will be important determinant of net national saving, and therefore of private domestic investment and international capital flows. ...|$|E
