5|$|To silence Luna, Aguinaldo {{appointed}} him as Chief of War Operations on 26 September 1898, and assigned {{the rank of}} brigadier general. In quick succession, he was made the Director or Assistant Secretary of War and Supreme Chief of the Republican Army on 28 September, arousing {{the envy of the}} other generals who were fighting since {{the first phase of the}} Revolution. Meanwhile, Luna felt that bureaucratic placebos were being thrown his way, when <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> to organize and discipline the enthusiastic but ill-fed and ill-trained troops into a real army.|$|E
5|$|Naoi {{is a human}} {{originally}} {{thought to be a}} non-player character (non-human). After he died, Naoi developed hypnotic powers that allow him to control others and cause them to enter a dream-like state. In life, {{he was the son of}} a famous potter. However, it was his twin brother who had the talent in pottery and as a result, Naoi was ignored by everyone. When his brother died, he was made to replace him by his father and was given strict training in pottery. As a result, he felt as if his own life was fake and <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> to be acknowledged for his own existence. He later befriends Otonashi after he acknowledges him and joins the SSS. As acting student council president for a time and self-proclaimed God, Naoi is strict and arrogant, but this is quick to disperse when Otonashi chastises him. He is affectionate to Otonashi, much to the latter's chagrin, and always tries to earn his affection. He uses dual USP 45 handguns.|$|E
5|$|During {{the court}} case, Huseby {{stated that he}} wanted help from society and {{attention}} drawn to his cause. However, he stated that he regretted doing this by hijacking. He stated that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> {{to send a message}} to the minister of justice and prime minister that he needed help, and that he did not intend that the other passengers be aware of his threats. Huseby stated that the hijacking was spontaneous and that he planned to make an armed robbery or take hostages at the Radisson SAS hotel in Oslo. His defence lawyer argued that Huseby did not commit a hijacking in the letter of the law, but had instead taken hostages, which would result in a lesser sentence. The court psychologists stated that Huseby had a difficult childhood, and had been defined as an alcoholic at the age of 17. They considered him to have very underdeveloped ability to make rational decisions and weak mental health. They also stated that he committed crimes to identify himself due to his low self-esteem. On 29 May 1986, Huseby was found guilty of hijacking in Eidsivating Court of Appeal. He was sentenced to three years prison and five years of preventive supervision.|$|E

25|$|Louis Coulon de Villiers, who did {{not know}} when British {{reinforcements}} might arrive, sent an officer under a white flag to negotiate. Washington did not allow the Canadian officer into or near the fort, but sent two of his own men, including his translator Jacob Van Braam, to negotiate. As negotiations began, the Virginians, against Washington's orders, broke into the fort's liquor supply and got drunk. Coulon told Van Braam that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> the surrender of the garrison, and the Virginians could go back to Virginia. He warned, however, that if they did not surrender now, the Indians might storm the fort and scalp the entire garrison.|$|E
500|$|In 1987, the Ramblin' Wreck and Dean Jim Dull were {{featured}} on ABC-TV's morning show. Dean Dull shouted into the camera, [...] "I'm Dean of Students Jim Dull and I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech. Good Morning, America!" [...] Dull {{was on the}} show because he had won a make-a-wish contest. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> for the Ramblin' Wreck, gold-clad students, and himself {{to be on the}} ABC morning show and ABC granted the wish.|$|E
500|$|Late in his life, Alf wrote a {{manuscript}} detailing {{his life story}} which he bequeathed to John. It was Alf's attempt {{to fill in the}} lost years when he had not been in contact with his son, and to explain that it was Julia, and not Alf, who had broken up their marriage. John later commented: [...] "You know, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> for me to hear his side of the story, which I hadn't heard." [...] By 1976, Alfred was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer and Pauline contacted John via Apple Corps {{to make sure that he}} was aware that his father was dying. John sent a large bouquet of flowers to the hospital and phoned Alf on his deathbed, apologising for his (John's) past behaviour. On 1 April 1976, Alf Lennon died in Brighton.|$|E

2500|$|I saw him ride by. He didn't stop, {{but went}} {{straight}} {{on up the}} creek in plain sight of everyone. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> to be seen, as his reputation {{was so great that}} his presence in a community had the desired effect. Within a week three settlers in the neighborhood sold their holdings and moved out. That was the end of cattle rustling on the North Laramie." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the [...] "painful {{situation}} in which I feel myself placed", Fitzwilliam appealed to Burke's memory. However Milton assured his father that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> permission to give reform his general support, to which Fitzwilliam acquiesced. When in summer 1822 Yorkshire reformers wanted a county meeting to push for reform, Milton said of his father: [...] "I do feel very great difficulty upon one which agitates him to a degree which cannot be conceived {{by those who have}} not been in the habit of conversing with him upon it. It is indeed the only subject I know which deprives him of his usual calmness".|$|E
2500|$|It was Bismarck's {{ambition}} to be assimilated into the mediatized houses of Germany. He attempted to persuade Kaiser Wilhelm I {{that he should}} be endowed with the sovereign duchy of Lauenburg, in reward for his services to the imperial family and the German empire. This was on the understanding that Bismarck would immediately restore the duchy to Prussia; <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> the status and privileges of a mediatized family for himself and his descendants. This novel idea was rejected by the conservative emperor, who thought that he had already given the chancellor enough rewards. There is reason to believe that he informed Wilhelm II of his wishes. After being forced by the sovereign to resign, he received the purely honorific title of [...] "Duke of Lauenburg", without the duchy itself and the sovereignty that would have transformed his family into a mediatized house. Bismarck regarded it as a mockery of his ambition, and he considered nothing more cruel than this action of the emperor.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1865 Ali Ben Ghedhahem and {{his brother}} Abd En Nebi were taken under watch to Constantine while his men were {{disarmed}} and interned by the French. The French treated them well, as they saw him as a potential ally {{in the event of}} a future conquest of the country. On 5 February Sadok Bey granted a fresh amnesty to the rebels who had fled, but not to the Ben Ghedhahem brothers. At the same time, the Bey made secret contact with them, claiming that the French were making preparations to betray them and deliver them both to him at the Bardo. Finally, missing his homeland, Ali Ben Ghedhahem took flight on 17 November 1865 and returned to Tunisia, hiding out in the Regba massif near the border at Ghardimaou. The Bey's armies under General Slim laid siege to him but the mountain people refused to give him up. [...] Some tribal leaders tried to persuade him to resume armed resistance in order to end the reprisals and extortions the army was inflicting on their region, but he refused. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> a pardon from the Bey so he could return to normal life. Eventually, he was persuaded to place himself under the protection of an Algerian marabout of the Tijaniyya order, Mohammed el Aïd, who was on his way to Mecca by way of Tunis. [...] On 25 February 1866, Ben Ghedhahem joined his caravan at El Ksour. The caïd of El Kef wanted to arrest him, but his soldiers refused to do so. [...] On 28 February, having reached Téboursouk, he was captured by cavalry sent out by the Bey. His brother managed to escape.|$|E

60|$|He {{perceived}} {{that he had}} walked very nearly into a hornets' nest, and the realisation of his escape made him agree readily to all the conditions imposed. The apology to the Gazeka was made without reserve, and the offensively forgiving, say-no-more-about-it-but-take care-in-future air {{of the head of}} the house roused no spark of resentment in him, so subdued was his fighting spirit. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> to get the thing done with.

60|$|He {{put down}} the umbrella, and {{followed}} her into the corner, retreating out of the rain. He needed no eyes to see. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> to know through touch.

But {{he did not want to}} know anything about her, he only wanted to discover her. And through her clothing, what absolute beauty he touched.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} hardship in being an invalid {{is the fact}} that people come and see you and keep your spirits up. The Honorable Freddie Threepwood suffered extremely from this. His was not a gregarious nature and it fatigued his limited brain powers to have to find conversation for his numerous visitors. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> to be left alone to read the adventures of Gridley Quayle, and when tired of doing that to lie on his {{back and look at the}} ceiling and think of nothing.|$|E
