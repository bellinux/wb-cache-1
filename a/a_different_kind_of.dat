These attachment patterns are associated with behavioral patterns and can help further predict a child's future personality.|$|E

The commentary is a catena of quotations of nine church fathers: Origen, Eusebius, Titus of Bostra, Basil, Isidore of Pelusium, Cyril of Alexandria, Sever from Antioch, Victor from Antioch, and Chrysostom. The commentary surrounds the single-column text of Luke on three sides. Patristic text is written in small uncial letters. Most of the quotations are those of Ciril of Alexandria (93 scholia); next comes Titus of Bostra (45 scholia).

5|$|Throughout his life, but {{especially}} during the 1770s, Bellman also wrote religious poetry, seeing no conflict with his bacchanalian works; he published collections of his religious poems in 1781 and 1787. He wrote some ten plays (none with particularly strong plots) as divertimentos, some of them later serving as entertainments at the royal court. The plays fill Volume 6 of his collected works. In 1783, Bellman brought out The Temple of Bacchus (Bacchi Tempel), perhaps hoping to establish {{his reputation as a}} poet, rather than the merry entertainer that he was in fact known as at the time; but he always stood out in people's minds as unique, <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> writer and performer.|$|E

5|$|With the {{discovery}} of Pluto in 1930, most astronomers considered the Solar System to have nine planets, along with thousands of significantly smaller bodies (asteroids and comets). For almost 50years Pluto {{was thought to be}} larger than Mercury, but with {{the discovery}} in 1978 of Pluto's moon Charon, it became possible to measure Pluto's mass accurately and to determine that it was much smaller than initial estimates. It was roughly one-twentieth the mass of Mercury, which made Pluto by far the smallest planet. Although it was still more than ten times as massive as the largest object in the asteroid belt, Ceres, it had one-fifth the mass of Earth's Moon. Furthermore, having some unusual characteristics, such as large orbital eccentricity and a high orbital inclination, it became evident that it was <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> body from any of the other planets.|$|E
5|$|Both the Human {{fleet and}} the rebel Cylons are disillusioned after finding Earth devastated by a nuclear holocaust, which {{occurred}} at least 2,000 {{years prior to}} the events of the episode. After research on the bodies found in the soil, the Cylons and Dr. Baltar (James Callis) conclude the remains are not Human, but Cylon in origin. The rebel Cylons further state the mechanical Cylon remains resemble older Centurions of theirs, but are of a kind unknown to them. Following this, they postulate that the Thirteenth Tribe consisted of <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Cylon which existed over 2,000 years ago and moved out from Kobol to populate Earth. When addressing the fleet, Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) never states this fact, leaving the fleet in the belief that the Thirteenth Tribe was human. Meanwhile, Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco), Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) and Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma) receive memories showing that they had lived and died on Earth 2,000 years ago. Kara Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) has Leoben (Callum Keith Rennie) help track the origins of the beacon. However, what they find is a crashed Colonial Viper, containing a corpse with Starbuck's dog tags. After Kara recites what the Hybrid has told her, Leoben becomes scared and retreats, with Thrace wondering what she is. In shock, Thrace takes the body and burns it on a pyre, and decides to not tell anyone about what she found, making people believe she lost the signal.|$|E
