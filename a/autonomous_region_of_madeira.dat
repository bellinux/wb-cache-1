40|$|Abstract Background Despite the {{importance}} of immigrant population in Portugal few studies have analyzed the patterns of overweight/obesity in this subpopulation. The aims of this study are: (i) describe and compare the prevalence of overweight between immigrants and natives in Portugal; (ii) analyze the association between length of residence and overweight among adult immigrants in Portugal. Methods A cross-sectional study (2005 – 2006) in {{a representative sample of}} the Portuguese population from national territory, including the <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Regions</b> <b>of</b> Azores and <b>Madeira.</b> The final sample comprised 31, 685 adult participants (≥ 19  years old), of whom 4. 6 % were immigrants. Country of birth was used to determine immigrant condition. Logistic regressions were conducted to investigate the association between overweight (dependent variable) and length of residence (exposure), adjusting for all covariates in the study. A 5 % confidence level and 95 % CI were considered. Results The percentage of immigrants that are overweight [44. 9 % (95 % CI: 42. 3; 47. 5) ] was lower than for natives [52. 8 % (95 % CI: 52. 2; 53. 4) ]. The migrant condition, after adjusted for sociodemographic variables, was not associated with overweight [OR 1. 004 (95 % CI: 0. 998; 1. 010) ]. Among immigrants, being women [OR 0. 585 (95 % CI: 0. 583; 0. 587) ], not married [OR 0. 784 (95 % CI: 0. 781; 0. 787) ] and with a higher education [OR 0. 481 (95 % CI: 0. 478; 0. 483) ], are probably protective factors of being overweight. Adjusting for other factors, the odds of being overweight for a long-term immigrant (≥ 15  years) was 1. 3 times higher [OR 1. 274 (95 % CI: 1. 250; 1. 299) ] than for the newcomers (< 4  years). Conclusions The prevalence of overweight was higher for natives than immigrants. Length of residence (≥ 15  years) was positively associated with prevalence of overweight, among adult immigrant population. In the future, understanding dietary patterns and acculturation process may be important for health immigrant studies...|$|R

5000|$|In Iberia {{the mean}} {{frequency}} of haplogroup L lineages reaches 3.83%; the frequency {{is higher in}} Portugal (5.83%) than in Spain (2.9% average), and without parallel {{in the rest of}} Europe. In both countries, frequencies vary widely between regions, but with increased frequencies observed for Madeira (insular Portugal), southern Portugal, Córdoba (southern Spain), Huelva (southern Spain), Canary Islands (insular Spain), Extremadura (western Spain) and Leon (western Spain). In the <b>Autonomous</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> Portugal (i.e. <b>Madeira</b> and the Azores), L haplogroups constituted about 13% of the lineages in Madeira, significantly more than in the Azores. In the Canary Islands, frequencies have been reported at 6.6%. Regarding Iberia, current debates are concerned with whether these lineages are associated with prehistoric migrations, the Islamic occupation of Iberia, or the slave trade. [...] suggested that African lineages in Iberia were predominantly the result of the Atlantic slave tarade. [...] revealed that most of the L lineages in Iberia matched Northwest African L lineages rather than contemporary Sub-Saharan L lineages. The authors suggest that this pattern indicates that most of the Sub-Saharan L lineages entered Iberia in prehistoric times rather than during the slave trade. According to , the Sub-Saharan lineages found in Iberia matched lineages from diverse regions in Africa. They suggest this pattern is more compatible with a recent arrival of these lineages after slave trading began in the 15th century. According to the study, alternative scenarios that invoke much older and demographically more significant introductions (...) or that claim a substantial role of the Roman and/or Islamic periods on the introduction of Sub-Saharan lineages seem unlikely. [...] extracted DNA from human remains that were exhumed from old burial sites in Al-Andalus, Spain. The remains date to between the 12th and 13th centuries. The frequency of Sub-Saharan lineages detected in the medieval samples was 14.6% and 8.3% in the present population of Priego de Cordoba. The authors suggest the Muslim occupation and prehistoric migrations before the Muslim occupation would have been the source of these lineages. The highest frequencies of Sub-Saharan lineages found so far in Europe were observed by Álvarez et al. (2010) in the comarca of Sayago (18.2%) which is, according to the authors, [...] "comparable to that described for the South of Portugal" [...] and by Pereira et al. 2010 in Alcácer do Sal (22%).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{development}} {{and testing of}} the questionnaire used in the first Portuguese National Health Examination Survey (INSEF), a cross-sectional prevalence {{study conducted by the}} National Health Institute Doutor Ricardo Jorge (INSA) in cooperation with the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, five Regional Health Administrations and the Regional Health and Social Affairs Offices <b>of</b> the <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Regions</b> <b>of</b> Azores and <b>Madeira.</b> INSEF aims at in-depth knowledge about health status, health determinants and use of health care services. INSEF target population comprises community-dwelling individuals aged between 25 and 74. The survey encompasses a blood collection, a physical examination and a questionnaire applied by Computer Assisted face-to-face interview. The questionnaire has four thematic areas (health status; health determinants; health behaviours and health services use), following national and international guidelines, such as the European Health Examination Survey, the 4 th and 5 th National Health Surveys and other instruments selected by INSA. INSEF questionnaire was pre-tested to evaluate three dimensions: comprehension (clarity of questions), judgment (evaluation of recall and perceptions) and response requested format. A convenience sample of 30 individuals, users of Alcácer do Sal Health Center or employers of INSA was recruited. Participants were 26 to 60 years old and mostly female. Participants answered the questionnaire and assessed it in a face-to-face semi structured interview based in an evaluation grid: understanding of the questions and the terms; repetition of some questions and overall evaluation of the questionnaire. Combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was used for pre-test data analyses. Of the three dimensions assessed, difficulties were mostly brought up within comprehension. In particular, participants indicated the lack of knowledge on specific terminology, ambiguous questions criteria and length of questions as critical issues. Participants also pointed out difficulties in estimating time, degree or ranking. Sensitive questions within mental health and functional evaluation subsections were indicated as potentially producing response bias. Some questions were too long and overly complex. Also participants had issues in choosing from a high number of response options and in answering in the given response formats. Some individuals did not find the response options to be mutually exclusive. Solutions found to answer to the difficulties encountered by participants were developed at three levels: questionnaire, training and fieldwork manual. To improve comprehension some questions were reformulated, glossaries were developed and notes for interviewers on questions criteria and participant’s clues were included. Judgment issues were solved also by rewriting questions, changing response design from closed to open and including examples in response options. Cards with response options, to be shown to participants during the interview, were introduced to facilitate the response and approach in sensitive questions. Small introductions for sensitive subsections were provided and strategies to approach participants were developed in training sessions with interviewers. During these sessions questions criteria were clarified and highlighted and examples of coding open responses in closed format design were provided. Findings are specific to INSEF, but include suggestions for adapting the approaches as well as consider implications for other health surveys.
