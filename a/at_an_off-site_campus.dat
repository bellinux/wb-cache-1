5000|$|In English-speaking countries, {{the term}} shabbaton is often {{employed}} to mean an event or program of education, and usually celebration, that is held on a Shabbat (Jewish sabbath).

Many communities have such events, including youth groups, singles groups, synagogues, schools, social groups, charitable groups or even family reunions. These events can be multi-generational and wide open, or limited to a small specific group. A shabbaton can be held where a group usually meets, or <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>off-site</b> location.

50|$|A tryout is {{the staging}} of {{performances}} of a theatrical production (i.e., a play or musical) <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>off-site</b> venue for evaluation and possible revision before the production premieres on Broadway or the West End. A tryout {{is similar to}} a workshop production in that the point is to identify and eliminate embarrassing flaws before the production is put on before highly demanding New York or London audiences, but unlike a workshop, it is usually more developed, less rough, and closer to the intended final product. If a tryout goes well and irons out the last few bugs, then that assures the project's investors that when it does debut on Broadway or the West End, it will already be fully polished and more likely to receive favorable reviews and play to sold-out houses for several years, so they can recoup their investment. Conversely, tryouts enable theatrical audiences in less prestigious markets to preview potential future hits and get bragging rights that they saw those works first.|$|R

40|$|Contaminated air {{and process}} gases, whether in a crewed {{spacecraft}} cabin atmosphere, the working volume of a microgravity science or ground-based laboratory experiment facility, or the exhaust from an automobile, are pervasive problems that ultimately effect human health, performance, and well-being. The need for highly-effective, economical decontamination processes spans {{a wide range}} of terrestrial and space flight applications. Adsorption processes are used widely for process gas decontamination. Most industrial packed bed adsorption processes use activated carbon because it is cheap and highly effective. Once saturated, however, the adsorbent is a concentrated source of contaminants. Industrial applications either dump or regenerate the activated carbon. Regeneration may be accomplished in-situ or <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>off-site</b> location. In either case, concentrated contaminated waste streams must be handled appropriately to minimize environmental impact. As economic and regulatory forces drive toward minimizing waste and environmental impact, thermal catalytic oxidation is becoming more attractive. Through novel reactor and catalyst design, more complete contaminant destruction and greater resistance to poisoning can achieved leading to less waste handling, process down-time, and maintenance. Performance of a prototype thermal catalytic reactor, based on ultra-short channel monolith (USCM) catalyst substrate design, under a variety of process flow and contaminant loading conditions is discussed. The experimental results are evaluated against present and future air quality control and process gas purification processes used on board crewed spacecraft...|$|R
40|$|The {{technology}} to harvest electricity from wind energy is now advanced {{enough to make}} entire cities powered by it a reality. High-quality short-term forecasts of wind speed are vital to making this a more reliable energy source. Gneiting et al. (2006) have introduced {{a model for the}} average wind speed two hours ahead based on both spatial and temporal information. The forecasts produced by this model are accurate, and subject to accuracy, the predictive distribution is sharp, i. e., highly concentrated around its center. However, this model is split into nonunique regimes based on the wind direction <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>off-site</b> location. This paper both generalizes and improves upon this model by treating wind direction as a circular variable and including it in the model. It is robust in many experiments, such as predicting at new locations. We compare this with the more common approach of modeling wind speeds and directions in the Cartesian space and use a skew-t distribution for the errors. The quality of the predictions from all of these models can be more realistically assessed with a loss measure that depends upon the power curve relating wind speed to power output. This proposed loss measure yields more insight into the true value of each model’s predictions. Some key words: Circular variable, power curve, skew-t distribution, wind direction, wind speed...|$|R

40|$|Radioactive {{high-level}} waste (HLW) has been managed at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) {{for a number}} of years.

Four intermediate- scale HLW can tests (two 6 -in OD {times} 12 -in tall and two 4 -in OD {times} 7 -in tall) are described and compared to small-scale HIP can tests (1 - to 3 -in OD {times} 1 - to 4. 5 -in tall). The intermediate-scale HIP cans were loaded with a 70 / 30 calcine/frit blend and HIPped <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>off-site</b> facility <b>at</b> 1050 {degrees}C; and 20 ksi. The dimensions of two cans (4 -in OD {times} 7 -in tall) were monitored during the HIP cycle with eddy-current sensors. The sensor measurements indicated that can deformation occurs rapidly at 700 {degrees}C; after which, there is little additional can shrinkage. HIP cans were subjected to a number of analyses including calculation of the overall packing efficiency (56 to 59 %), measurement of glass-ceramic (3. 0 to 3. 2 g/cc), 14 -day MCC- 1 leach testing (total mass loss rates < 1 g/m{sup 2 } day), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Based on these analyses, the glass-ceramic material produced in intermediate-scale cans is similar to material produced in small-scale cans. No major scale-up problems were indicated. Based on the packing efficiency observed in intermediate- and small-scale tests, the overall packing efficiency of production-scale (24 -in OD {times} 36 - to 190 -in tall) cans would be approximately 64 % for a pre-HIP right-circular cylinder geometry.
