However, in Zhoushan, there are many problems in the development of <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> industry, featuring weak brand consciousness, inadequate famous brand and pillar industries, frequently restricted by green trade barrier and disordered competition of <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> market. The comparative advantages of <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> Cross-Straits are measured by using revealed comparative advantage index (RCA) and trade specialized index (TSC), the results show that the <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> in both the mainland and Taiwan have certain market share and competitiveness. The revealed comparative advantage index ï¼ˆRCAï¼‰of Taiwan’ <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> is higher than that in the mainland, while the RCA index in the mainland and Taiwan all shows descending trend; the trade specialized index(TSC) cross straits is positive, which indicates specialized export, but this specialization also shows descending trend. Taiwan has advanced aquaculture technology and the mainland owns cheap labor cost and low price, but due to the limited resources in the Taiwan Island and the backward processing technology of <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> in the mainland, the comparativeness of <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> in the mainland and Taiwan has slid slightly. Therefore, I probe into the cooperation modality between Zhoushan and Taiwan in terms of mutual investment in aquatic industry, exchange and training for personnel cross straits and establishing experimental point of aquatic industry of the Zhoushan Island and Taiwan Island. Besides, countermeasures for enhancing the international comparativeness of aquatic industry in Zhoushan Island are put forward.

Volatile basic nitrogen (VBN), histamine (HIS), indole, tetrodotoxin (TTX), and paralytic, neurotoxic, amnesic and diarrhetic shellfish poisons (PSP, NSP, ASP, and DSP, respectively) in the samples of live fresh <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> and food-borne diarrhea cases in six studied districts were analyzed. Results indicate that the incidence rate of food-borne diarrhea is related to the hygiene index values. Aside from VBN, the main risk factors related to food-borne diarrhea in edible <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> include DSP (in marine fish, shrimp, and other shellfishes), NSP, and ASP (in marine shrimp and crab). Hygiene index values among different species were significantly different. No significant difference in the monitoring index values was found among the six different studied districts. The reported cases of food-borne diarrhea were positively associated with VBN and DSP in <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> in Haishu, Jiangbei, Zhenhai, and Beilun, as well as VBN and NSP in <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> in Jiangdong and Yinzhou.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{concentrations of}} perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in <b>aquatic</b> <b>products,</b> and risks to human health, concentrations of 12 PFCs were measured in edible tissues of <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> collected from Tianjin, China, a typical industrial {{area on the}} western Bohai Sea. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the predominant PFC. Concentrations of PFOS in <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> from Tianjin Binhai New Area (TBNA) ranged from < 0. 10 to 241 ng/g wet weight, with the greatest concentration observed in the edible portions of mullet (Mugil so-iuy Basilewsky). Concentrations of PFOS in mullet from the TBNA were greater than those in other species of lower trophic levels, which suggests biomagnification. Concentrations of PFOS in <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> from markets were greater than those of locally farmed or wild marine products. Relatively great concentrations of PFOS were not only observed in products from the rapidly growing industrial areas such as Tangu District (TG) and Hangu District (HG), but also in less industrialized areas like the Dagang District (DG). The results of the hazard assessment indicated that consumption of seawater-farmed fish and market fish posed a greater hazard than wild marine fish or freshwater-farmed fish, but the risk to human health was not great...|$|R

40|$|Japan {{has been}} the biggest export market of <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> of China for many years. The export of <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> to Japan reached more than 700, 000 ton and 3 billion in 2007. The {{influence}} to the export market caused by the sweeping economic crisis will affect {{the benefits of the}} export enterprises of China. The trade complementary index shows great potential of <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> trade between China and Japan. However, under the circumstances of economic crisis, to set up limits of import would be the prior choice of the trade policy by Japan. The paper analyses the trade economic efficiency (TEE) of the export <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> to Japan in detail. TEE is an index to reflect the export situation of one country from the economic point of view by the trend of trade price change. If TEE> 1, then the trade (either export or import) of the interested country is more efficient than the average level of the world market. If TEE< 1, the situation is the opposition. We choose the species which export quantity exceeds 1000 ton to analyze and find out that the TEE of only 10 species is more than 1, which refers to more efficient. The number doesn_t reach 1 / 3 of the sample. The TEE of some species is even not as much as 0. 6. Moreover, the paper points out that the limits set up to the <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> of China under the economic crises by Japan will be different from those of before. According to the dual characteristics of technical trade measure, the limits set up can be based on market failure as well as on economic benefit. The purpose of former is to protect the consumers. In the latter condition, the benefit of producers is considered. The limits set up this time would be based on the economic benefits {{in order to protect the}} benefit of domestic producers. Therefore, the export of <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> of China may encounter dual difficulties. Not only will the TEE of export be worse, but also will the export scale be declined. Accordingly, the government should take more effective measures to improve the export environment in order to help the enterprises to get through the trouble...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{requirements}} for high quality and diversification aquatic products are increasing with {{the improvement of}} Chinese living standard. However, the distribution between place of production and place of consumption are uneven, which results in large cold-chain logistics demand for aquatic products. At present, the low-level development of cold chain logistics has a bad impact on the circulation of aquatic products in China. So it is very urgent to develop cold-chain logistics in China. Design/methodology/approach: In order to do this, we apply performance evaluation, a well-known management tool, to study Chinese <b>aquatic</b> <b>product</b> cold-chain logistics. In this paper we first propose SISP(Subjects, Indexes, Standards, and Phases of performance evaluation) model and ACSSN model(Aquatic product, Customer, Supply Chain, Society, and Node enterprises of supply chain) for aquatic products cold-chain logistics performance evaluation. Then an ANP-Fuzzy method is proposed to evaluate the operational performance of Shandong Oriental Ocean Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. Furthermore, a system dynamic model is built to simulate the impact of temperature on the profits in aquatic products cold-chain sales section. Findings: We find out within a reasonable temperature range, lower temperature brings higher profit level. Also, performance improvement methods are proposed and the simulation of performance evaluation system is developed. Practical implications: Our findings can help to improve the level of <b>aquatic</b> <b>product</b> cold-chain logistics in China. Originality/value: The paper proposes the SISP (Subjects, Indexes, Standards, and Phases of performance evaluation) model and ACSSN model (<b>Aquatic</b> <b>product,</b> Customer, Supply Chain, Society, and Node enterprises of supply chain) for aquatic products cold-chain logistics performance evaluation. </p...|$|E
