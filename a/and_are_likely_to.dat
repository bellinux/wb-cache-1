5|$|A new ergate {{spends the}} first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. She then {{graduates}} to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> die soon of natural causes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s the {{prevailing}} {{view was that}} the genes in a chromosome acted like discrete entities, indivisible by recombination and arranged like beads on a string. The experiments of Benzer using mutants defective in the rII region of bacteriophage T4 (1955-1959) showed that individual genes have a simple linear structure <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be equivalent to a linear section of DNA.|$|E
5|$|Young forests (trees <2 years old) {{are most}} at risk from ash falls <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be {{destroyed}} by ash deposits >100 mm. Ash fall is unlikely to kill mature trees, but ash loading may break large branches during heavy ash falls (>500 mm). Defoliation of trees may also occur, especially {{if there is a}} coarse ash component within the ash fall.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1755 earthquake, Boston and its {{surrounding}} towns have become a major metropolitan area. Much new construction has been built on infill, especially in the Back Bay area, which may be prone to greater shaking and to compaction of the sand and gravel used as fill. Many older buildings in the Boston area are built from stone and brick, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> collapse completely during a major earthquake. Given this, modern observers have {{expressed concern about the}} effects of another quake in such a major city. A 1990 study by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency estimated potential financial losses at between $4 billion and $5 billion, and potential loss of life in the hundreds. As a consequence, the state has updated building codes and zoning laws to require that new construction and additions in vulnerable areas be built to resist earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{reliable}} {{data on the}} status of wolves in the Middle East, save for those in Israel and Saudi Arabia, though their numbers appear to be stable, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> remain so. Israel's conservation policies and effective law enforcement maintain a moderately sized wolf population, which radiates into neighbouring countries, while Saudi Arabia has vast tracts of desert, where about 300–600 wolves live undisturbed. The wolf survives throughout most of its historical range in Saudi Arabia, probably {{because of a lack of}} pastoralism and abundant human waste. Turkey may play an important role in maintaining wolves in the region, because of its contiguity with Central Asia. The mountains of Turkey have served as a refuge for the few wolves remaining in Syria. A small wolf population occurs in the Golan Heights, and is well protected by the military activities there. Wolves living in the southern Negev desert are contiguous with populations living in the Egyptian Sinai and Jordan. Throughout the Middle East, the species is only protected in Israel. Elsewhere, it can be hunted year-round by Bedouins.|$|E
5|$|With {{material}} from previous articles, Weisman uses {{the fate of}} the Mayan civilization to illustrate the possibility of an entrenched society vanishing and how the natural environment quickly conceals evidence. To demonstrate how vegetation could compromise human built infrastructure, Weisman interviewed hydrologists and employees at the Panama Canal, where constant maintenance is required to keep the jungle vegetation and silt away from the dams. To illustrate abandoned cities succumbing to nature, Weisman reports from Chernobyl, Ukraine (abandoned in 1986) and Varosha, Cyprus (abandoned in 1974). Weisman finds that their structures crumble as weather does unrepaired damage and other life forms create new habitats. In Turkey, Weisman contrasts the construction practices of the rapidly growing Istanbul, as typical for large cities in less developed countries, with the underground cities in Cappadocia. Due to a large demand for housing in Istanbul much of it was developed quickly with whatever material was available and could collapse in a major earthquake or other natural disaster. Cappadocian underground cities were built thousands of years ago out of volcanic tuff, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> survive for centuries to come.|$|E

25|$|Co-operation in {{evolution}} {{is the process}} where groups of organisms work or act together for common or mutual benefits. It is commonly defined as any adaptation that has evolved, at least in part, to increase the reproductive success of the actor's social partners. For example, territorial choruses by male lions discourage intruders <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> benefit all contributors.|$|E

The expansion's details are deliberately being kept flexible to better adapt to changing conditions in the airline industry <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> change over the next 8–10 years.

25|$|After {{emerging}} in the autumn, the migrant forms of sugarbeet root aphids seek out Populus trees to colonize. These migrant forms are short-lived, and usually die within 12 to 48 hours. In selecting trees to colonize, the autumn migrants of sugarbeet root aphids prefer to colonize larger trees over smaller ones, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> use simple cues such as tree crown size or tree resistance to colonization to decide on which trees to colonize. Despite the importance of leaf size to stem mothers, autumn migrants {{do not appear to}} take leaf size into consideration when choosing a tree to colonize.|$|E

25|$|A profile HMM is {{a variant}} of an HMM {{relating}} specifically to biological sequences. Profile HMMs turn a multiple sequence alignment into a position-specific scoring system, {{which can be used}} to align sequences and search databases for remotely homologous sequences. They capitalise on the fact that certain positions in a sequence alignment tend to have biases in which residues are most likely to occur, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> differ in their probability of containing an insertion or a deletion. Capturing this information gives them a better ability to detect true homologs than traditional BLAST-based approaches, which penalise substitutions, insertions and deletions equally, regardless of where in an alignment they occur.|$|E
25|$|The pneumonic form of plague {{arises from}} {{infection}} of the lungs. It causes coughing and sneezing and thereby produces airborne droplets that contain bacterial cells <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> infect anyone inhaling them. The incubation period for pneumonic plague is short, usually two to four days, but sometimes just a few hours. The initial signs are indistinguishable from several other respiratory illnesses; they include headache, weakness, and spitting or vomiting of blood. The course of the disease is rapid; unless diagnosed and treated soon enough, typically within a few hours, death may follow in one to six days; in untreated cases mortality is nearly 100%.|$|E
25|$|Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS). Data from an {{acoustic}} observatory (RCS) 40km west of Rottnest Island, Western Australia, near the Perth Canyon.

Several IMOS recorders deployed in the Indian Ocean off northwestern Australia by CMST may have recorded data related to Flight 370. These recorders were not recovered as part of the investigation.
