Later on, a sub-subfamily of AluS which included active Alu elements was given the separate name AluY. Dating back 65 million years, the AluJ lineage is the oldest and least active in the human genome. The younger AluS lineage is about 30 million years old and still contains some active elements. Finally, the AluY elements are the youngest of the three and have the greatest disposition to move along the human genome. The discovery of Alu subfamilies led to the hypothesis of master/source genes, and provided the definitive link between transposable elements (active elements) and interspersed repetitive DNA (mutated copies of active elements).|$|E

5000|$|A {{detailed}} (albeit partially outdated) {{description of}} the Phrap algorithms {{can be found in}} the Phrap documentation. A recurring thread within the Phrap algorithms is the use of Phred quality scores. Phrap used quality scores to mitigate a problem that other assembly programs had struggled with at the beginning of the Human Genome Project: correctly assembling frequent imperfect repeats, in particular <b>Alu</b> <b>sequences.</b> Phrap uses quality scores to tell if any observed differences in repeated regions are likely to be due to random ambiguities in the sequencing process, or more likely to be due to the sequences being from different copies of the Alu repeat. Typically, Phrap had no problems differentiating between the different Alu copies in a cosmid, and to correctly assemble the cosmids (or, later, BACs). The logic is simple: a base call with a high probability of being correct should never be aligned with another high quality but different base. However, Phrap does not rule out such alignments entirely, and the cross_match alignment gap and alignment penalties used while looking for local alignments are not always optimal for typical sequencing errors and a search for overlapping (contiguous) sequences. (Affine gaps are helpful for homology searches but not usually for sequencing error alignment). Phrap attempts to classify chimeras, vector sequences and low quality end regions all in a single alignment and will sometimes make mistakes. Furthermore, Phrap has more than one round of assembly building internally and later rounds are less stringent - Greedy algorithm.|$|E

40|$|The primate Alu {{interspersed}} repeats can be {{subdivided into}} classes {{on the basis}} of shared nucleotides at a set of diagnostic positions. Each of the classes of <b>Alu</b> <b>sequences</b> is apparently the result of past retrotransposition of transcripts of highly conserved class-specific source genes that differed from each other at the diagnostic positions. The nucleotides at the majority of positions are identical among the source genes and therefore were identical among all of the <b>Alu</b> <b>sequences</b> {{at the time of their}} insertion. These CONSBI (conserved before insertion) positions are useful because the changes that have occurred after insertion are recognizable and the divergence resulting from nucleotide substitutions, insertions, and deletions is informative. The divergence of <b>Alu</b> <b>sequences</b> at the CONSBI positions is a measure of the time since a class was inserted. The greatest majority of <b>Alu</b> <b>sequences</b> are in one class (identified as class II), and it is particularly suitable for such examination, since nearly full-length sequences are now known for nearly a thousand members of this class. The average divergence of class II members indicates that the class has an average age of about 40 million years. The distribution in divergence of class II accurately fits a sum of two Poisson distributions. The implication is that class II <b>Alu</b> <b>sequences</b> were derived from two massive past events of insertion of many <b>Alu</b> <b>sequences.</b> In this model the younger subset of class II sequences (corresponding to about 300, 000 copies in the genome) has an average divergence of 5 % at CONSBI positions. The older set of class II sequences (corresponding to about 150, 000 genomic copies) has a 9 % average divergence. Based on the drift rate of primate DNA sequences, the events of insertion probably occurred 30 - 50 million years ago. The goodness of the fit to the Poisson distribution indicates that no significant number of members of class II have been inserted since 30 million years ago...|$|E

We show here that an <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence</b> encodes functional binding sites for retinoic acid receptors, which {{are members of the}} nuclear receptor family of transcription factors. The consensus sequences for the evolutionarily recent Alu subclasses contain three hexamer half sites, related to the consensus AGGTCA, arranged as direct repeats with a spacing of 2 bp, which is consistent with the binding specificities of retinoic acid receptors. An analysis was made of the DNA binding and transactivation potential of these sites from an <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence</b> that has been previously implicated in the regulation of the keratin K 18 gene. These Alu double half sites are shown to bind bacterially synthesized retinoic acid receptors as assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. These sites are further shown to function as a retinoic acid response element in transiently transfected CV- 1 cells, increasing transcription of a reporter gene by a factor of approximately 35 -fold. This transactivation requires cotransfection with vectors expressing retinoic acid receptors, as well as the presence of all-trans-retinoic acid, which is consistent with the known function of retinoic acid receptors as ligand-inducible transcription factors. The random insertion of potentially thousands of Alu repeats containing retinoic acid response elements throughout the primate genome is likely to have altered the expression of numerous genes, thereby contributing to evolutionary potential...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe exonization of an Alu-like element into a coding {{sequence}} {{is unique to}} primates and this phenomenon distinguishes our genome from other mammals. Here, we report {{the presence of a}} special splicing variant of a proapoptotic protein Bcl-rambo in human lymph node, designated as Bcl-rambo beta. This variant contains a 98 bp Alu-like sequence which acts as an exon. There exists an in-frame stop codon within this inserted Alu-like cassette, resulting in generation of a premature protein of 104 amino acid residues. Unlike the Bcl-rambo, Bcl-rambo beta is lacking of the BH 1, BH 2 and BH 3 motifs and becomes a BH 4 -only protein. Bcl-rambo beta is detected in several adult human tissues such as heart, lymph node and cervix but is absent in human brain tissue. In addition, Bcl-rambo beta is found not to be associated with mitochondria due to the absence of its C-terminal membrane anchor region. Nevertheless, this cytosol-localized protein is capable of promoting etoposide- and Taxol-induced cell death. Although the exact function of the <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence</b> is not fully characterized, the Alu element within the Bcl-rambo beta appeared to contribute to the proapoptotic capability, since removing of the <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence</b> from Bcl-rambo beta abrogates its ability to induce cell death.

40|$|Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an {{autosomal}} recessive neurodegenerative disorder commonly caused by large expansions of a GAA repeat {{in the first}} intron of the frataxin gene, FRDA. The expansion of the triplet repeat is localized within an <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence.</b> FRDA GAA-repeat alleles {{can be divided into}} three classes depending on their lengths: short normal alleles (SN), long normal alleles (LN) and expanded pathological alleles (E). We made an accurate analysis of the <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence</b> containing the GAA repeat. We found a new single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that is the closest one to the GAA repeat. We studied this new SNP and the polymorphic polyA region contiguous to the GAA triplets in two populations with different frequencies of FRDA. We found that, while both E and LN alleles seem to be genetically homogeneous and likely related, SN represents a more heterogeneous class of alleles. Indeed, one SNP variation (T) was more frequently associated with (GAA) (8) alleles, whereas the other one (C) with (GAA) (9) repeat(s). The long normal and expanded alleles presented the C haplotype. The same correlation was described for polyA-tract polymorphisms. Thus, 14 A was commonly associated with (GAA) (8) alleles and 17 A with (GAA) (9) alleles. The long normal alleles more frequently showed the 17 A haplotype. Our data seem to suggest that all the E alleles come from LN alleles, while LN alleles come from a defined subclass of SN alleles.
