5|$|Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, {{and thereby}} avoid {{detection}} and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved {{to recognize and}} neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system {{in the form of}} enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or <b>acquired)</b> <b>immunity</b> creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of <b>acquired</b> <b>immunity</b> is the basis of vaccination.|$|E
5|$|Viral {{infections in}} animals provoke an immune {{response}} that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses {{can also be}} produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially <b>acquired</b> <b>immunity</b> to the specific viral infection. However, some viruses including those that cause AIDS and viral hepatitis evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections. Antibiotics {{have no effect on}} viruses, but several antiviral drugs have been developed.|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, and astrovirus {{are known}} to cause viral {{gastroenteritis}}. Rotavirus {{is the most common}} cause of gastroenteritis in children, and produces similar rates in both the developed and developing world. Viruses cause about 70% of episodes of infectious diarrhea in the pediatric age group. Rotavirus is a less common cause in adults due to <b>acquired</b> <b>immunity.</b> Norovirus is the cause in about 18% of all cases.|$|E

5|$|The major way {{bacteria}} {{defend themselves}} from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes that destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called restriction endonucleases, cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells. Bacteria also contain {{a system that}} uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of viruses that the bacteria have {{come into contact with}} in the past, which allows them to block the virus's replication through a form of RNA interference. This genetic system provides bacteria with <b>acquired</b> <b>immunity</b> to infection.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that there were two}} billion cases of gastroenteritis that resulted in 1.3million deaths globally in 2015. Children and those in the developing world are most commonly affected. As of 2011, in those less than five, there were about 1.7billion cases resulting in 0.7million deaths, with most of these occurring in the world's poorest nations. More than 450,000 of these fatalities are due to rotavirus in children under 5years of age. Cholera causes about three to five million cases of disease and kills approximately 100,000 people yearly. In the developing world, children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year that result in significant gastroenteritis. It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of <b>acquired</b> <b>immunity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Smallpox {{is highly}} contagious, but {{generally}} spreads more slowly and less widely {{than some other}} viral diseases, perhaps because transmission requires close contact and occurs after {{the onset of the}} rash. The overall rate of infection is also affected by the short duration of the infectious stage. In temperate areas, the number of smallpox infections were highest during the winter and spring. In tropical areas, seasonal variation was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year. Age distribution of smallpox infections depends on <b>acquired</b> <b>immunity.</b> Vaccination immunity declines over time and is probably lost within thirty years. Smallpox is not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there is no asymptomatic carrier state.|$|E

40|$|Schistosomiasis is a {{parasitic}} blood fluke {{infection of}} 200 million people worldwide. We {{have shown that}} humans can <b>acquire</b> <b>immunity</b> to reinfection after repeated exposures and cures with the drug praziquantel. The increase in resistance to reinfection was associated {{with an increase in}} schistosome-specific IgE. The ability to develop resistance and the rate at which resistance was acquired varied greatly in two cohorts of men within close geographic proximity and with similar occupational exposures to schistosomes. These differences are likely attributable to differences in history of exposure to Schistosoma mansoni infection and immunologic status at baseline, with those <b>acquiring</b> <b>immunity</b> faster having lifelong S. mansoni exposure and immunologic evidence of chronic S. mansoni infection. As many conflicting results {{have been reported in the}} literature regarding immunologic parameters associated with the development of resistance to schistosome infection, exposure history and prior immune status should be considered in the design of future immuno-epidemiologic studies...|$|R
50|$|Moreover, {{studies have}} shown that women <b>acquire</b> <b>immunity</b> to PAM through {{antibody}} recognition of the VAR2CSA domain, also known as VSAPAM, after exposure during their first pregnancy. By measuring circulating levels of IgG antibodies that presumably target VAR2SCA, the study demonstrated that subsequent pregnancies confer progressively greater protection to PAM. Thus, PfEMP1 proteins such as the VAR2CSA domain could prove attractive as potential candidates for vaccine targets.|$|R
5|$|In 1958 Gustav Nossal and Lederberg {{showed that}} one B cell always {{produces}} only one antibody, {{which was the}} first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book The Clonal Selection Theory of <b>Acquired</b> <b>Immunity.</b> His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and somatic hypermutation as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that a multicomponent, {{adaptive}} immune system arose with the first vertebrates, as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response. Many species, however, utilize mechanisms {{that appear to be}} precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity. Immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life, with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism, called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens, called bacteriophages. Prokaryotes also possess <b>acquired</b> <b>immunity,</b> through a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference. Prokaryotes also possess other defense mechanisms. Offensive elements of the immune systems are also present in unicellular eukaryotes, but studies of their roles in defense are few.|$|E
5|$|Immunology is {{a science}} that {{examines}} the structure and function of the immune system. It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease. The earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC. Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time. In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom. This and other observations of <b>acquired</b> <b>immunity</b> were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory. It was not until Robert Koch's 1891 proofs, {{for which he was}} awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease. Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by Walter Reed.|$|E
5000|$|In The Palace of Love Master Edelrod {{explains}} to Kirth Gersen that {{to avoid this}} fate a venefice will try to <b>acquire</b> <b>immunity</b> to the poisons {{that may be used}} against him and also exercises great caution in all his personal dealings (going so far as pre-emptively poisoning any rivals). In this way he will [...] "live to become an old man" [...] (a Sarkoy expression).|$|R
50|$|Travelers {{often get}} {{diarrhea}} from {{eating and drinking}} foods and beverages that have no adverse effects on local residents. This is due to immunity that develops with constant, repeated exposure to pathogenic organisms. The extent and duration of exposure necessary to <b>acquire</b> <b>immunity</b> has not been determined; it may vary with each individual organism. A study among expatriates in Nepal suggests that immunity may take up to seven years to develop—presumably in adults who avoid deliberate pathogen exposure.Conversely, <b>immunity</b> <b>acquired</b> by American students while living in Mexico disappeared, in one study, as quickly as eight weeks after cessation of exposure.|$|R
30|$|The total {{population}} is epidemiologically divided into susceptible, latent, and infectious classes.

N(t)=S(t)+L(t)+I(t) is the {{total population}} size. We assume that individuals recovered by successful treatment do not <b>acquire</b> <b>immunity,</b> and they will become member of the susceptible compartment. Hence our model is of SLIS type.|$|R
5|$|Members of {{the breed}} {{are not usually}} ridden until they are four years old, and {{structural}} development is not complete until age seven. Their most productive years are between eight and eighteen, although they retain their strength and stamina into their twenties. An Icelandic mare that lived in Denmark reached a record age of 56, while another horse, living in Great Britain, {{reached the age of}} 42. The horses are highly fertile, and both sexes are fit for breeding up to age 25; mares have been recorded giving birth at age 27. The horses tend to not be easily spooked, probably the result of not having any natural predators in their native Iceland. Icelandics tend to be friendly, docile and easy to handle, although also enthusiastic and self-assured. As a result of their isolation from other horses, disease in the breed within Iceland is mostly unknown, except for some kinds of internal parasites. The low prevalence of disease in Iceland is maintained by laws preventing horses exported from the country being returned, and by requiring that all equine equipment taken into the country be either new and unused or fully disinfected. As a result, native horses have no <b>acquired</b> <b>immunity</b> to disease; an outbreak on the island would be likely to be devastating to the breed. This presents problems with showing native Icelandic horses against others of the breed from outside the country, as no livestock of any species can be imported into Iceland, and once horses leave the country they are not allowed to return.|$|E

25|$|Immunity can be {{acquired}} either actively or passively. Immunity is acquired actively {{when a person}} is exposed to foreign substances and the immune system responds.

50|$|As {{with many}} other Australian frogs, the {{predominant}} reason for the corroboree frogs' decline {{is thought to be}} infection with the chytrid fungus. This fungus {{is believed to have been}} accidentally introduced to Australia in the 1970s and destroys the frogs' skin, usually fatally. Corroboree frogs' eggs appear to be immune. Frog populations may eventually be able to <b>acquire</b> <b>immunity,</b> as wild relatively healthy adults have been found with the fungus on their skin.|$|R
30|$|In 1927, Kermack and McKendrick {{devised the}} Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model which has {{presented}} an interesting {{contribution to the}} mathematical theory of epidemics [1]. The mathematical SIR model {{is in the form}} of three compartments: susceptible, infected or removed. Susceptible populations are healthy and do not carry the epidemic but can contract it from infected individuals which carry the infection and can pass it to susceptible hosts, while the removed people are no longer infected and <b>acquire</b> <b>immunity</b> from future contagion.|$|R

25|$|Many of {{the natives}} died from new {{infectious}} diseases, such as influenza and probably smallpox, to which they lacked resistance or <b>acquired</b> <b>immunity.</b> The new colonists intermarriaged with the local native population.

This removed the breeding grounds of the mosquito vector. It is likely that survivors' <b>acquired</b> <b>immunity</b> from the 1870s epidemics contributed more to lesser fatalities from the disease in future years. In 1887, a source of abundant and pure artesian water was found beneath the city, which guaranteed its water supply and aided its recovery.|$|E

25|$|It {{was another}} 150years before another European group {{recorded}} the Tunica. In 1699 when encountered by the LaSource expedition (coming downriver from Canada), the Tunica were a modest-sized tribe numbering {{only a few}} hundred warriors, with about 900 people in total.

25|$|Insects, like {{nearly every}} other {{organism}} on Earth, {{are subject to}} infectious diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and nematodes. These encounters can either kill the insect or greatly weaken it. Insects protect themselves against these detrimental microorganisms in two ways.
