5|$|Since first {{coming to}} wide {{notice in the}} late 1990s, the Harry Potter book series by J. K. Rowling has engendered a number of legal disputes.

While these legal proceedings have countered a number of cases of outright piracy, other attempts have targeted not-for-profit endeavours and have been criticised.|$|E
