5|$|In {{the poem}} Gawain, when the Knight is beheaded, he tells Gawain {{to meet him}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Chapel, saying that all nearby know where it is. Indeed, the guide which is to bring Gawain there from Bertilak's castle grows very fearful as they near it and begs Gawain to turn back. The final meeting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Chapel has caused many {{scholars}} to draw religious connections, with the Knight fulfilling a priestly role with Gawain as a penitent. The Green Knight ultimately, in this interpretation, judges Gawain to be a worthy knight, and lets him live, playing a priest, God, and judge all at once.|$|E

By 2000, {{the population}} of Green Lake was 51, the same number reported in 1970 and 1990.|$|E

5|$|As {{the date}} approaches, Sir Gawain sets {{off to find}} the Green Chapel and keep {{his side of the}} bargain. Many adventures and battles are alluded to (but not described) until Gawain comes across a splendid castle where he meets Bertilak de Hautdesert, the lord of the castle, and his {{beautiful}} wife, who are pleased to have such a renowned guest. Also present is an old and ugly lady, unnamed but treated with great honour by all. Gawain tells them of his New Year's appointment <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Chapel and that he only has a few days remaining. Bertilak laughs, explains that the Green Chapel is less than two miles away and proposes that Gawain rest at the castle till then. Relieved and grateful, Gawain agrees.|$|E
5|$|By January 24, {{the number}} {{had risen to}} more than 30,600 per day—three {{times as many as}} {{originally}} estimated. Angry commuters using the Anacostia, Navy Yard, and Waterfront stations peppered the transit agency with complaints. WMATA claimed that a number of factors contributed to the ridership crunch: the system was experiencing record ridership; two-year-old ridership projections were used; the five stations were opened two months ahead of schedule; the five new stations were opened two months before new rail cars were ready for service; and WMATA offered free parking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Line stations, which drew 12,000 rather than 4,000 riders to the line.|$|E
5|$|In Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, the Green Knight appears before Arthur's court {{during a}} Christmas feast, holding a bough of holly {{in one hand}} and a battle axe in the other. Despite {{disclaim}} of war, the knight issues a challenge: he will allow one man to strike him once with his axe, with the condition that he return the blow the next year. At first, Arthur accepts the challenge, but Gawain takes his place and decapitates the Green Knight, who retrieves his head, reattaches it and tells Gawain to meet him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Chapel at the stipulated time.|$|E

5|$|On July 14, 2012, Barr came in second, {{losing the}} {{nomination}} to Jill Stein. Stein chose Cheri Honkala as her running-mate despite suggestions {{that she could}} choose Barr. Barr was given a prime speaking role <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Party National Convention in Baltimore, Maryland, but decided to instead send a surrogate, (Farheen Hakeem), to speak on her behalf. Barr's surrogate reportedly chided the party for not respecting Barr's candidacy. A shouting match in a hallway reportedly ensued. Barr repeatedly criticized Jill Stein after losing the Green Party nomination, and caused controversy by using alleged transphobic words in statements about Stein on Twitter.|$|E
5|$|The Knight {{features}} next as Bercilak de Hautedesert, lord {{of a large}} castle, Gawain's host {{before his}} arrival <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Chapel. At Bercilak's castle, Gawain is submitted to tests of his loyalty and chastity, wherein Bercilak sends his wife to seduce Gawain and arranges that each time Bercilak gains prey in hunting, or Gawain any gift in the castle, each shall exchange his gain for the other's. At New Year's Day, Gawain departs to the Green Chapel, and bends to receive his blow, {{only to have the}} Green Knight feint two blows, then barely nick him on the third. He then reveals that he is Bercilak, and that Morgan le Fay had given him the double identity to test Gawain and Arthur.|$|E

The tour was filmed by Charisma for a possible cinema release, but {{was rejected by the}} band who felt it was not up to standard. The group returned to the U.S. in December 1973, with three shows at the Roxy in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, City Council Member Eric Ulrich, a Republican {{representing}} Ozone Park, {{came out}} against the plan as among other things, it prohibited left turns at Jamaica Avenue. He had been in favor of bus rapid transit along Woodhaven Boulevard, as he stated in a 2014 opinion editorial. The plan was modified in May 2016 {{in an effort to}} accommodate Ulrich's objections. It included restrictions on left-turns at only five intersections, including none at Jamaica Avenue. The left-turn restrictions were put into the plan to speed up travel times by eliminating the signal time allocated to split phasing—a traffic-signal setup where traffic in one direction has a green light, while the other directions of traffic have a red light, in order to allow drivers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>green</b> light to turn left without conflicts from oncoming traffic. The restrictions also reduce conflicts between turning vehicles and pedestrians. Instead of banning left turns at Jamaica Avenue, the left turn bays would be re-engineered around the BMT Jamaica Line subway columns to decrease blind spots and collisions. Local community members were also opposed to the plan due to the reduction of traffic lanes along the boulevard's service roads from two lanes to a single lane.|$|E
