40|$|<b>Corporate</b> <b>governance</b> was {{dominated}} by corporate scandals across the world involving such companies as Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Parmalat, Polly Peck, and Maxwell. Over {{the last two decades}} a number of reports have been commissioned into the subject of <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> and as a result a number of codes of best practice have emerged worldwide. Following these reports, the Financial Reporting Council issued the combined code on <b>corporate</b> <b>governance,</b> which is adopted by the Irish stock exchange. Furthermore, since 2001 in Ireland there have been significant regulation and legislation initiatives made to enhance <b>corporate</b> <b>governance.</b> The objective of this dissertation is to examine the auditors’ perceptions of <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> in Irish PLC’s. The literature review presents a comprehensive overview of the evolution of <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> and outlines US and Irish legislation <b>regarding</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance.</b> It also outlines the importance of auditors and their key role <b>regarding</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance.</b> The primary research for this dissertation was undertaken through five semi-structured interviews with audit partners from the four largest audit practices in Ireland based on fee income. The research revealed auditors are in favour of the “comply or explain” approach to <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> and that Ireland should adopt a stakeholder approach to <b>corporate</b> <b>governance.</b> Additionally, the research revealed that auditors’ believe that the board of directors have a key role in relation to <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> and that the mechanisms introduced in the combined code are all good. The main problem is in relation to non compliance with the combined code and the auditors favoured introducing a monitoring body in relation to non compliance. Furthermore, the research uncovered that auditors felt there was too much legislation in Ireland and that auditing was become a “box ticking exercise”. The auditors’ also suggested that they would think twice about pursuing a career in auditing in the current environment.

40|$|Recent {{accounting}} scandals, {{often led}} by managers {{trying to improve}} results and thereby their own bonuses, have severely damaged the publics view of management. In the aftermath of scandals such as Enron, Parmalat and Skandia, demand has increased for <b>Corporate</b> <b>Governance</b> codes and similar regulation. The Swedish code for <b>Corporate</b> <b>Governance</b> came into effect on July 1, 2005. The code requires all Swedish companies listed on the Swedish Stock Exchange (OMX A- and O-list), with a turnover exceeding 3 billion SEK, to disclose a report <b>regarding</b> <b>Corporate</b> <b>Governance,</b> attached to the annual report. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine whether the new disclosure required by the Swedish <b>Corporate</b> <b>Governance</b> code will have a measurable effect on stock prices. The authors have applied event study methodology examining daily returns around the announcement of the <b>Corporate</b> <b>Governance</b> reports. The listed companies mentioned above were also divided into groups depending on whether or not the report hade been audited, and to which extent the authors found the reports to be transparent. Also, two groups were formed with companies applying SOX, and companies not required to apply the code. The results show that a measurable negative effect could be identified on the 1 % significancelevel on the day of the event for the whole sample of companies. Companies publishing audited reports found positive Abnormal Returns, but without significance. Negative abnormal returns were found on the 1 % significance-level for companies not presenting audited reports. No significant results were found for the groups classified after the degree of transparency. The findings suggest that the market is not fully mature enough to evaluate unaudited reports. The market rewards companies that audit the reports. The conclusion of this paper is therefore that reports <b>regarding</b> <b>Corporate</b> <b>Governance</b> do have a negative effect on stock prices...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to look at how recent {{corporate}} scandals have translated into heightened interest in understanding various facets of <b>corporate</b> <b>governance,</b> notably the effectiveness of boards of directors and the composition of boards with particular attention to the gender dimension. In this context, the current study gauges the perceptions of Lebanese women managers <b>regarding</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> issues pertaining to board effectiveness, roles and responsibilities and the benefits of female representation on boards. Design/methodology/approach: The approach takes the form of a literature review and survey type questionnaire deriving from the literature. The questionnaire was administered to a sample of 61 top and middle level women managers, drawn from the context of 12 different banks in the Lebanese context. Findings: The findings suggest that Lebanese women managers consider current board performance as not being satisfactory, that women are important board member candidates and that the low representation of women on boards in Lebanon is related to glass ceiling type impediments. They also believed that women board representation can reflect positively on the status of women at work and that government intervention is needed to level the playing field for women in management and at the boardroom level. Originality/value: The value added of this research is to gauge Lebanese women's perceptions <b>regarding</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> issues and the gender dimension, which is of direct relevance/interest to them.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the state of <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> as a major factor {{affecting}} the growth performance of the private sector in MENA countries. For this purpose both country-specific assessments, carried out by World Bank-IMF teams (so-called ROSC’s assessments) and focus-group discussions that took place in four regional conferences have been synthesized. Strengths and weaknesses of <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> in selected Arab countries have been highlighted. One major key finding is that the legal and regulatory frameworks of the assessed Arab countries are largely compliant with the OECD Principles of <b>corporate</b> <b>governance.</b> However, practices are not. The difficulty of the assessments is to reflect properly the discrepancies between the letter of the law and compliance. It should be emphasized that the World Bank-IMF assessments focus on listed companies. No-listed firms, especially SME, family-owned firms and State-owned enterprises that make up to 98 % of all firms, are not subject to assessments.

Information on <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> has been collected from the companies’ Web sites, the annual reports, as well as other documents <b>regarding</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> features. The main objectives of the research are: Ÿ to monitor <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> structures and policies adopted by the companies included in our sample; Ÿ to make a comparison between <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> in Italian companies and in Anglo-Saxon companies; Ÿ to define determinants of <b>corporate</b> <b>governance.</b> As far as the first objective is concerned, we have information concerning board size, number and qualification of independent and non-executive directors, compensation and nomination policies, separation of the chairman from the chief executive officer, audit committee size, composition and policies; internal dealing regulations, shareholders’ meeting rules and so on. The international comparison aims at highlighting differences between the Anglo-Saxon <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> model and the Italian one. In Italy, <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> issues did not attract much attention in the past, given the high concentration in the ownership structure of most Italian listed companies, the influence of families in running companies, and the absence of a real separation between capitalists and management. However, {{the increase in the number}} of companies listed on the Stock Exchange, the issue of the Preda Code (the Self Regulation Act for listed companies), and the ever increasing pressures coming from foreign institutional investors are emphasizing the importance of <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> issues thus pushing more and more companies to embrace Anglo-Saxon practices (independent directors, audit, nomination and remuneration committees) ...|$|R
