5|$|Galileo's {{discovery}} {{proved the}} importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by showing that there were objects in space to be discovered that until then had remained unseen by the naked eye. More importantly, the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, which held that Earth was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it. Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), which announced celestial observations through his telescope, does not explicitly mention Copernican heliocentrism, a theory that placed the Sun <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the universe. Nevertheless, Galileo accepted the Copernican theory.|$|E

5|$|A {{much larger}} galaxy cluster is the redshift-0.0354 Abell 2063. The cluster {{is thought to}} be {{interacting}} with the nearby galaxy group MKW 3s, based on radial velocity measurements of galaxies and the positioning of the cD galaxy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> Abell 2063. The active galaxy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> MKW 3s—NGC 5920—appears to be creating a bubble of hot gas from its radio activity. Near the 5th-magnitude star Pi Serpentis lies AWM 4, a cluster containing an excess of metals in the intracluster medium. The central galaxy, NGC 6051, is a radio galaxy that is probably responsible for this enrichment. Similar to AWM 4, the cluster Abell 2052 has central cD radio galaxy, 3C 317. This radio galaxy is believed to have restarted after a period of inactivity less than 200 years ago. The galaxy has over 40,000 known globular clusters, the highest known total of any galaxy as of 2002.|$|E

5|$|Although he venerated Scott's {{writing skill}} {{and use of}} history as backdrop, Balzac worked to more {{accurately}} depict the turbulence {{of the human heart}} – and its effect on history.
