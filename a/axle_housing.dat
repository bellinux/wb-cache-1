2500|$|When {{used in this}} way, a {{differential}} couples {{the longitudinal}} input shaft (or prop shaft) to the pinion, which in turn drives the transverse ring gear of the differential. This also works as reduction gearing. On rear wheel drive vehicles the differential may connect to half-shafts inside an <b>axle</b> <b>housing,</b> or drive shafts that connect to the rear driving wheels. Front wheel drive vehicles tend to have the engine crankshaft and the gearbox shafts transverse, and with the pinion {{on the end of}} the main-shaft of the gearbox and the differential enclosed in the same housing as the gearbox. There are individual drive-shafts to each wheel. A differential consists of one input, the drive shaft, and two outputs which are the two drive wheels, however the rotation of the drive wheels are coupled to each other by their connection to the roadway. [...] Under normal conditions, with small tire slip, the ratio of the speeds of the two driving wheels is defined by the ratio of the radii of the paths around which the two wheels are rolling, which in turn is determined by the track-width of the vehicle (the distance between the driving wheels) and the radius of the turn.|$|E

50|$|These ten-coupled {{locomotives}} had carrying <b>axles</b> <b>housed</b> in a Bissel bogie. The fixed third axle {{acted as}} the driving axle and had thinner wheel flanges to begin with. After 1945 its flanges were removed entirely to improve curve running still further. The wheelbase was 3,000 mm initially; this was later increased to 4,000 mm.|$|R
50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{are used}} on the ICF bogies. These bearings are press fitted on the axle journal by heating the bearings at a temperature of 80 to 100 °C in an induction furnace. Before fitting the roller bearing, an axle collar is press fitted. The collar ensures that the bearing does not move towards {{the center of the}} axle. After pressing the collar, a rear cover for the axle box is fitted. The rear cover has two main grooves. In one of the grooves, a nitrile rubber sealing ring is placed. The sealing ring ensures that the grease in the <b>axle</b> box <b>housing</b> does not seep out during the running of the wheels. A woolen felt ring is placed in another groove. After the rear cover, a retaining ring is placed. The retaining ring is made of steel and is a press fit. The retaining ring ensures that the rear cover assembly is secured tightly between the axle collar and the retaining ring and stays at one place. The roller bearing is pressed after the retraining ring. Earlier, the collar and the bearings were heated in an oil bath. But now the practices has been discontinued and an induction furnace is used to heat them before fitting on the axle. The <b>axle</b> box <b>housing,</b> which is a steel casting, is then placed on the axle. The bearing is <b>housed</b> in the <b>axle</b> box <b>housing.</b> <b>Axle</b> box grease is filled in the <b>axle</b> box <b>housing.</b> Each <b>axle</b> box <b>housing</b> is filled with approximately 2.5 kg. of grease. The front cover for the axle box is placed on a housing which closes the axle box. The front cover is bolted by using torque wrench.|$|R
50|$|Introduction of Hytrel washers was {{considered}} a breakthrough in the ICF dashpot design. However, the mass scale replacement of the rubber washers by Hytrel washers without adequate trials lead to massive failure of the <b>axle</b> Box <b>housing.</b>|$|R

50|$|A slow-running, large {{series-wound motor}} with 28 poles and two commutators drove the wheels, without any gear reduction, via an {{unsprung}} jackshaft. The jackshaft was linked by a coupling rod to three driving <b>axles</b> <b>housed</b> in the locomotive frame. The axle {{base of the}} driving axles was 2000 mm. The jackshaft was located {{between the first and}} second driving axles. The first and third driving axles were fixed to the frame, the centre one had transverse play to facilitate curve running. The mass was further distributed to two carrying axles that were designed as Adams axles. Control was achieved by means of a variable transformer (Drehtransformator) and power circuit breaker (Lastschalter) with 11 steps.|$|R
50|$|The coaches {{come to the}} {{workshop}} once in a year. During examination of these coaches, it was noticed that the Hytrel washers have not only damaged the <b>axle</b> box <b>housing</b> but also the lower spring seat {{as well as the}} Protective tube.|$|R
50|$|The tender {{locomotives}} {{of classes}} 41 and 45 {{only had a}} Krauss-Helmholtz bogie at the front; the trailing <b>axle</b> was <b>housed</b> in a Bissel bogie. The tank locomotives of Class 85, {{like some of the}} Class 64 and 86 engines, had two Krauss-Helmholtz bogies.|$|R
50|$|Traction bars —usually, a set {{of square}} tubes {{attached}} to the back axle via 2 U bolts {{before and after the}} <b>axle</b> <b>housing</b> leading forward with a rubber snubber at the top end allowing as the car takes off to limit axle wrap on leaf springs.|$|E
50|$|Many farm tractor designs have {{incorporated}} their engine block, transmission case, and rear <b>axle</b> <b>housing</b> as frame members. Probably {{the first was}} the Fordson tractor, but many others followed. As with many other instances of integration of components into fewer castings, lower unit cost of production was the driver.|$|E
50|$|For {{vehicles}} with {{leaf spring suspension}} such as pickup trucks, the leaf spring is sometimes eliminated and replaced with a multiple-bar linkage. These bars are typically in a trailing arm configuration and the air spring may be situated vertically between a link bar or the <b>axle</b> <b>housing</b> and a point on the vehicle's frame. In other cases, the air bag is situated {{on the opposite side}} of the axle from the main link bars on an additional cantilever member. If the main linkage bars are oriented parallel to the longitudinal (driving) axis of the car, the <b>axle</b> <b>housing</b> may be constrained laterally with either a Panhard rod or Watt's linkage. In some cases, two of the link bars may be combined into a triangular shape which effectively constrains the vehicles axle laterally.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to their predecessors the machines {{were given a}} plate frame. Like them, however, the third axle is driven and the carrying <b>axles</b> are <b>housed</b> in a Bissel bogie. Two vacuum injectors form the feed water system. In order to enable brown coal firing, the grate area was increased {{compared with that of}} the Einheitslok.|$|R

50|$|They were to a {{large extent}} {{identical}} to the Class D XI from Bavaria, but the grate area and diameters of the carrying and coupled wheels were smaller. The rear coupled <b>axle</b> was <b>housed</b> in a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie, and the coal tanks were behind the driver's cab. It achieved its top speed on the level with a 400 tonne train.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{often used}} as a heavy duty {{demolition}} tool, the thermic lance {{can also be used}} to remove seized axles of heavy machinery without damaging the bearings or <b>axle</b> <b>housing.</b> This technique is most often used on the pins and axles of large equipment such as cranes, ships, bridges and sluice-gates.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{features}} which distinguishes this axle from other high-performance or heavy-duty domestic solid axles is that unlike other axle designs, access to the differential gears is not through the rear center cover; rather, in the Ford 9 inch, the rear cover is welded to the <b>axle</b> <b>housing,</b> and access to internals is obtained by removing the center cover on the pinion (front) side of the axle through which the driveshaft yoke connects, with the differential assembly {{coming out of the}} axle as a unit attached to the cover.,, Although this requires disconnecting the driveshaft to access the internal gearset, it offers the advantage of being able to disassemble and reassemble the differential gears and adjust clearances conveniently on the benchtop, rather than with the restricted access of working within the <b>axle</b> <b>housing</b> under the car.|$|E
5000|$|As introduced, the Servi-Car had a {{drum brake}} {{on the front}} wheel and another drum brake inside the rear <b>axle</b> <b>housing,</b> {{decelerating}} both rear wheels. [...] In 1937, the braking system was upgraded to have a drum brake on each wheel. [...] A hydraulic rear brake system was introduced in 1951. The very last Servi-Cars, built late in their last model year, would have disc brakes on all three wheels.|$|E
50|$|Ingersoll Machine & Tool {{specialized}} {{in the manufacture}} of steering gear assemblies for cars and boats - including car starters, steering gears, millimeter shells, truck <b>axle</b> parts, <b>house</b> trailer parts, and machine parts. IMT established a major presence within the automotive industry, and by the early 1930s, IMT made every steering gear assembly for Canadian-built Ford, Mercury, Dodge, Chrysler, DeSoto, Plymouth, Hudson, and Nash cars.|$|R
50|$|Within 6 {{months of}} {{provision}} of Hytrel washers {{on all the}} main line coaches, the failure of <b>Axle</b> box <b>housing</b> increased. The reason was the axle box wing cracks. Hence on examination of the failed axle boxes, it was noticed that the Hytrel washers were forming a deep groove of 4 to 8mm on the seating area of the axle box spring seating. They washers were also increasing {{the diameter of the}} spring seating due to continuous hitting of the raised section of the sitting area.|$|R
50|$|With this system, the {{outermost}} of several sets of successive driving wheel sets {{are not connected}} by coupling rods to crankshaft journals {{on the outside of}} the wheels, but by cogwheels located in the centre of the axles. The <b>axles</b> are <b>housed</b> in the locomotive frame such that they are able to move at right angles to the axis of the rails to a certain degree, likewise the cogwheels are able to slide relative to one another. In this way curves can be negotiated with less friction being generated.|$|R
50|$|On {{cars and}} trucks, several senses {{of the word}} axle occur in casual usage, {{referring}} to the shaft itself, its housing, or simply any transverse pair of wheels. Strictly speaking, a shaft which rotates with the wheel, being either bolted or splined in fixed relation to it, is called an axle or axle shaft. However, in looser usage, an entire assembly including the surrounding <b>axle</b> <b>housing</b> (typically a casting) is also called an axle.|$|E
50|$|The Quadra-Link front {{suspension}} design {{locates the}} axle with four leading control arms to control longitudinal movement and rotation about the lateral axis (drive and braking reaction), two above the axle and two below it. A panhard rod, {{also referred to}} as a track bar, is used to locate the axle laterally. Two coil springs are seated on top of the <b>axle</b> <b>housing</b> as well as two gas-charged shock absorbers. The suspension used on vehicles with the optional UpCountry package provided one inch of lift over the standard suspension. A sway bar is utilized to reduce body roll in turns.|$|E
50|$|When {{used in this}} way, a {{differential}} couples {{the input}} shaft (or prop shaft) to the pinion, which in turn runs on the ring gear of the differential. This also works as reduction gearing. On rear wheel drive vehicles the differential may connect to half-shafts inside an <b>axle</b> <b>housing,</b> or drive shafts that connect to the rear driving wheels. Front wheel drive vehicles tend to have the pinion {{on the end of}} the main-shaft of the gearbox and the differential is enclosed in the same housing as the gearbox. There are individual drive-shafts to each wheel.|$|E
50|$|The second E I series {{delivered}} to the Royal Bavarian State Railways was the Sondermann Variant built from 1896. It had two overlapping cylinders that formed a combined double slide valve (Doppelschieber). The carrying axle and the first driving <b>axle</b> were <b>housed</b> in a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie. The advantage of this locomotive variant was that the double cylinder was very short {{as a result of}} the tandem construction. Nevertheless, the engine did not perform especially well, so that the two units were converted into locomotives with a conventional cylinder arrangement.|$|R
5000|$|The {{foreground}} of the painting, {{depicting the}} north side of the Dam, shows groups of people. Merchandise is on display. Behind the Dam is the Damrak, bordered on both sides by rows of houses, and with cargo ships moored at its quay. To the right behind the building is the tower of the Oude Kerk Church. In the middle of the Damrak is the Papenbrug; sails are hanging to dry over the railings. In the middle of the quay, two men are working with the pier wheel and <b>axle.</b> The <b>house</b> to the left of the Dam is called ‘the Bishop’ and to the right is the inn ‘Under the Sail’.|$|R
5000|$|A hot box is {{the term}} used when an axle bearing overheats {{on a piece of}} railway rolling stock. [...] The term is derived from the journal-bearing trucks used before the mid-20th century. The <b>axle</b> {{bearings}} were <b>housed</b> in a box that used oil-soaked rags or cotton (collectively called [...] "packing") to reduce the friction of the axle against the truck frame. When the oil leaked or dried out, the bearings overheated, often starting a fire that could destroy the entire railroad car (and cars coupled to it) if not detected early enough.|$|R
5000|$|The Quadra-Link {{suspension}} {{design was}} used {{on both the}} front and rear axles. This design uses four control arms, two above the axle and two below it, to control longitudinal movement and rotation about the lateral axis (drive and braking reaction). A panhard rod, also referred to as a track bar, is used to locate the axle laterally. Two coil springs are seated on top of the <b>axle</b> <b>housing</b> as well as two gas-charged shock absorbers. The optional [...] "Up Country" [...] package included heavier duty German made gas charged shocks installed upside down, taller coil springs and longer bump stops; thereby increasing ride height by one inch.|$|E
50|$|In {{other types}} of {{suspension}} systems, the axles serve only to transmit driving torque to the wheels; the position and angle of the wheel hubs is an independent function of the suspension system. This {{is typical of the}} independent suspensions found on most newer cars and SUVs, and on the front of many light trucks. These systems still have differentials, but will not have attached <b>axle</b> <b>housing</b> tubes. They may be attached to the vehicle frame or body, or integral in a transaxle. The axle shafts (usually constant-velocity type) then transmit driving torque to the wheels. Like a full floating axle system, the drive shafts in a front-wheel drive independent suspension system do not support any vehicle weight.|$|E
5000|$|A {{full-floating axle}} shaft does not carry the vehicle's weight; it serves only to {{transmit}} torque from the differential to the wheels. It [...] "floats" [...] inside an assembly {{that carries the}} vehicle's weight. Thus the only stress it must endure is torque (not lateral bending force). Full-floating axle shafts are retained by a flange bolted to the hub, while the hub and bearings are retained on the spindle by a large nut. In contrast, a semi-floating design carries {{the weight of the}} vehicle on the axle shaft itself; there is a single bearing {{at the end of the}} <b>axle</b> <b>housing</b> that carries the load from the axle and that the axle rotates through.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{suspension}} in an ICF Bogie {{is through a}} dashpot arrangement. The dashpot arrangement consists of a cylinder (lower spring seat) and the piston (axle box guide). Axle box springs are placed on the lower spring seat placed on the axle box wing of the <b>axle</b> box <b>housing</b> assembly. A rubber or a Hytrel washer is placed below the lower spring seat for cushioning effect. The axle box guide is welded to the bogie frame. The axle box guide acts as a piston. A homopolymer acetyle washer {{is placed on the}} lower end of the axle box guide. The end portion of the axle box guide is covered with a guide cap, which has holes in it. A sealing ring is placed near the washer and performs the function of a piston ring. The axle box guide moves in the lower spring seat filled with dashpot oil. This arrangement provides the dampening effect during the running of the coach.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, rubber washers {{have been}} used at the seating {{arrangement}} of the primary springs of the <b>axle</b> box <b>housing</b> in the ICF design passenger coaches on the Indian Railways. The rubber washer is used directly on the axle box seating area. the lower spring seat sits on the washers. The lower spring seat is a tubular structure and 3/4 section is partitioned by using a circular ring which is welded at the 3/4 section. On the top of spring seat, a polymer ring called NFTC ring sits. The primary spring sits on the NFTC ring. The lower spring seat {{plays the role of}} a cylinder in the dashpot arrangement and is filled with oil. In the dashpot arrangement, the top portion is called the axle box guide. The axle box guide is welded to the bogie frame. The axle box guide works as a piston in the Lower spring seat filled with oil. This helps in damping the vibrations caused during running train operation.|$|R
50|$|A {{straight}} axle {{is a single}} rigid shaft connecting a wheel {{on the left side}} of the vehicle to a wheel on the right side. The axis of rotation fixed by the axle is common to both wheels. Such a design can keep the wheel positions steady under heavy stress, and can therefore support heavy loads. Straight axles are used on trains (that is, locomotives and railway wagons), for the rear axles of commercial trucks, and on heavy duty off-road vehicles. The axle can optionally be protected and further reinforced by enclosing the length of the <b>axle</b> in a <b>housing.</b>|$|R
