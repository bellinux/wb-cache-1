40|$|This paper explores how {{users of}} foods {{containing}} phytosterols are 'configured' within biomedical {{research and writing}} on these substances. A growing range of such foods have been launched and marketed {{on the basis that}} they <b>actively</b> <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol.</b> They are among the most prominent examples of a set of foods designated as 'functional foods'. The paper is based on an analysis of biomedical journal articles which address the use of phytosterols as a <b>cholesterol</b> <b>lowering</b> agent in humans. These include both original research papers and commentaries such as review articles, letters, editorials, news items and professional guidelines. My analysis suggests that users are constituted variously as autonomous, self-motivated consumers, patients and publics needing advice, people resistant to pill use, and practitioners looking for something to offer their patients. I characterise the imagined uses of the products as healthy/holistic, lazy/busy/contemporary, and incompetent use. These varying portrayals of users and their use of these food products entail different ways of understanding health identities and different allocations of responsibilities between the technology, user and health care professionals. I conclude that, while experts and regulators may attempt to configure 'correct' uses of these products, relatively {{little is known about the}} rationales and practices of actual users.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} notion of the late modern or {{reflexive}} subject, for whom consumption, rationality, autonomy and a reflexive attitude to risk are said to be constitutive. Drawing on an example of órdinaryh́ealth consumption (Gronow and Warde, 2001), the paper addresses what kinds of consumer identities emerge in peopleś talk about buying or eating foods containing phytosterols. These are f́unctional foodsẃhich are marketed on the basis that they <b>actively</b> <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol.</b> Based on interviews with people who say that they buy or eat these foods, the analysis focuses on participantsŕeported trajectories relating to how this came about. Participantsáccounts contain a number of explicit and implicit reasons for buying or eating the foods, which I characterise as agential, contextual, or non-agential, depending on {{the degree to which they}} draw on the agency of the actual purchaser or eater. These different types of explanations can be ordered in terms of their appeals to rationality, risk consciousness and autonomy. In agential explanations, people talk, for example, of doing something good for themselves, or experimenting with the foods. These explanations explicitly position consumers as health conscious, autonomous and rational to varying degrees. Contextual explanations drew on, for example, the role of doctors or family history in alerting people to a potential problem. These suggest both a different sense of risk consciousness, which may be prompted or contextual, and a less autonomous kind of consumer who is connected to others through a set of family and other relationships. Non-agential explanations, for example, where people attributed their consumption to others or to habit, appeal neither to the rationality, the health consciousness nor the autonomy of the actual consumer. The analysis helps to reinforce the potentially contextual or fluctuating nature of risk consciousness, and the relational and non-instrumental aspects of daily practices.

40|$|A high serum {{cholesterol}} {{level is}} a well documented risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consequently, a low serum cholesterol has in general been viewed as beneficial. However, since the early 70 s, results from several cohort studies and randomized trials have suggested that low or <b>lowered</b> <b>cholesterol</b> may {{increase the risk of}} dying from non-atherosclerotic causes. A number of reviews discussing the putative association between low serum cholesterol levels and increased mortality has been published. These reviews focused mainly on the possibility of a causal relation between low cholesterol and mortality from cancer. Although cancer mortality remains an important issue, the scope of recent studies on the association between low or <b>lowered</b> <b>cholesterol</b> and mortality has broadened towards all non-cardiovascular causes of death including accidents, violence and suicide. In the present paper the evidence is reviewed for an association between low or <b>lowered</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels and aggression, impulsivity and (mortality from) suicide. Both studies addressing 'naturally' occurring low cholesterol levels and studies in which a low cholesterol was the result of (drug) intervention are discussed. This distinction is important from an etiological point of view, notably because a 'naturally' occurring low <b>cholesterol</b> reflects the <b>lower</b> end of the <b>cholesterol</b> distribution while <b>lowered</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels of patients with hypercholesterolemia are still in {{the upper part of the}} distribution. Moreover, the duration of being 'exposed' to <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels is longer in those with 'naturally' occurring low cholesterol levels compared to those with 'lowered' cholesterol concentrations. The currently most important hypothesis to explain an association between naturally occurring low cholesterol and violent death, involving dietary induced serotonin changes as a mediating factor, is discussed in detail...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Screening <b>lower</b> high <b>cholesterol</b> and {{secretion}} of {{bile salt}} hydrolase (BSH) from yeast strains, {{and study the}} environmental factors for increasing the activity of BSH, then investigate the mechanism of <b>cholesterol</b> <b>lowering.</b> We obtained two yeasts to <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol</b> by high-throughput screening technology and o-phthalaldehyde: strain K 1 and strain M 3 are Kluyveromyces marxianus, are {{the highest rate of}} cholesterol-reducing strains by far, the <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol</b> rates were 68. 14 % ~ 70. 34 %, 80. 51 % ~ 99. 12 %. The two yeasts can secretion BSH in the metabolic process with the Oxford cup method, and the BSH activity is proportional to the rates of cholesterol-reducing. Strain M 3 has a higher BSH production capacity than strain K 1, and high cholesterol-lowering effect. That indicating efficient yeast strains to <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol</b> production is due to their abundant or high activity BSH. The BSH secretion of strain K 1 and strain M 3 demonstrated a key enzyme in cholesterol-lowering effect for the first time. BSH can hydrolyze conjugated bile salt and free bile salt, which can precipitate with cholesterol state, to reduce the effect of cholesterol. To aim directly at 4 major factors can affect the synthesis of BSH, the fermentation conditions of strain M 3 producing BSH highly were determined with four factors and three levels［L 9 (34) ］orthogonal experiment: fermentation temperature is 32 ℃, fermentation time is 24 h, the initial pH of medium is 6. 0, inoculums is 3 %. The activity of BSH secreted by Strain M 3 increased 50 % in the optimization of fermentation conditions. Strain K 1 and M 3 fermented milk with excellent performance, we could research and develop functional fermented dairy products and micro-ecology preparation, by using the characteristics of efficient to <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol</b> and complementary advantages of lactose fermentation performance of the two strains...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: the {{hypercholesterolemia}} is {{a growing}} problem, responsible of one fifth of coronary events in Spain. It is considered that plant sterols (PS) could {{play an important role}} in their treatment. Objective: we review the role of a range of functional foods with added PS (including specific studies using Flora pro•activ) in adults with hypercholesterolemia. Methods: we performed a review of the literature in the PubMed database to locate human studies that have evaluated the role of Flora pro•activ or PS fortified foods with a similar composition. We also have been consulted the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) database. Results: Flora pro•activ demonstrated in rigorous scientific studies to <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol</b> in adults with hypercholesterolemia. Two servings of Flora pro•activ (1. 5 g PS) are needed to observe this effect. <b>Lowering</b> <b>cholesterol</b> with Flora pro•activ (2 servings / day) oscillate as EFSA notes, between 7 and 10 %. This effect is observed after 2 - 3 weeks. Its composition allows to make health claims about <b>lowering</b> <b>cholesterol</b> as is described for the European Union. The cholesterol-lowering efficacy of PS enriched foods that are not margarine, mayonnaise, salad dressings or dairy products is under-researched. With few exceptions, the use of fortified foods with PS is safe. Conclusions: the current scientific evidence justify the promotion of the use of PS to <b>lower</b> LDL <b>cholesterol</b> in adults with hypercholesterolemia. </p...|$|R
