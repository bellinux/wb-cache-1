In 1978 they defended the Shield in 4 matches, extending their tenure to 13 successful defences before being defeated by North Auckland.

50|$|The {{system was}} {{completed}} under Ashikaga Yoshimitsu {{when he was}} 10 years old. During his father Ashikaga Yoshiakira's regency, who was until his death busy with the war with the Southern Court, the Ashikaga governors had become however strong and independent warlords. Even though as a consequence the provinces didn't <b>accept</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> the oversight of the Gozan and of the shogunate, the Gozan/Ankoku-ji system remained a valuable instrument to control the various Zen sects.|$|R
50|$|USYC's council {{conducted}} an investigation which was largely inconclusive. The {{study found that}} some officers had clearly signed secrecy agreements, but the council was unable to prove that all presidents and vice-presidents had done so.

In response, the USYC resolved not to <b>accept</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> funding from the Foundation for Youth and Student Affairs.|$|R

Therefore, after 1991 the Miss World Organization did not <b>accept</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> Miss USA 1st Runner-ups.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, the Somerset County Commissioners voted not to <b>accept</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> inmates {{from outside}} the county as the state Board of Corrections {{withheld}} its third quarter payment.

5|$|USB2.0 {{added two}} {{additional}} handshake packets: NYET and ERR.

A second use for a NYET packet is to tell the host that the device has accepted a data packet, but cannot <b>accept</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> due to full buffers. This allows a host to switch to sending small PING tokens to inquire about the device's readiness, rather than sending an entire unwanted DATA packet just to elicit a NAK.|$|R
50|$|By early 1945 half {{of almost}} all German {{soldiers}} taken prisoner in the West were held by U.S. forces, while the other half were taken by the British. But in late March 1945, as Allied forces struck {{into the heart of}} Germany after crossing the Rhine at Remagen, the number of German prisoners being processed caused the British to stop <b>accepting</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> prisoners into their camps. This forced the U.S. Army to take immediate action and establish the Rheinwiesenlager {{in the western part of}} Germany.|$|R

50|$|In 1969, the Lebanese Diocese {{board of}} Education invited Sarkis Choloian {{to guide the}} school. He first acted as a senior teacher then as {{principal}} {{until the end of}} the 1984-1985 academic year. During his reign the Mardikian Elementary school grew and starting from 1981, step by step climbed the secondary school levels. In the reign of S. Choloian, the number of students increases to such an extent that the school grounds are no longer capable of <b>accepting</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> students. The rise in students forces the administration to reject any newcomers.|$|R

When the local court of Schelenburg condemned two women to be {{burned at the stake}} for witchcraft in 1708, the sentence was revoked by the high court. In 1722, a soldier was executed for witchcraft in Bremerholm, but he was judged and executed by a military court. In 1733 a student and in 1752 a farmer were sentenced to life imprisonment and forced labour after having been judged guilty of a pact with the Devil, and as late as 1803 two craftsmen were sentenced for the same crime.|$|R
50|$|Hachiemon arrives {{outside and}} tells the girls and Umegawa's {{mistress}} {{what is going on}} with Chubei, and shows them the jar Chubei gave him to fool his mother. He urges them not to <b>accept</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> of Chubei's money, for fear that Chubei will ruin himself. Chubei arrives and overhears much of this. His pride is hurt, and despite Hachiemon's and Umegawa's urgings, he breaks the seal on the samurai's money in order to throw the money he owes at Hachiemon. He then uses the rest of the money to buy out Umegawa's contract, and once she understands what has happened, they flee together out of Osaka.|$|R
50|$|Packet loss {{concealment}} (PLC) is {{a technique}} to mask the effects of packet loss in VoIP communications. Because the voice signal is sent as packets on a VoIP network, they may travel different routes to get to destination. At the receiver a packet might arrive very late, corrupted or simply might not arrive. One of the {{cases in which the}} last situation could happen is where a packet is rejected by a server which has a full buffer and cannot <b>accept</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> data. In a VoIP connection, error-control techniques such as ARQ are not feasible and the receiver should be able to cope with packet loss.|$|R
5000|$|Anne Palles was {{the last}} person to be legally {{executed}} for sorcery in Denmark, but her case was not the last Danish witch trial. The last large witch trial in Denmark was the Thisted witch trial of 1698, in which several women were sentenced to death accused of having caused fits by sorcery. After the fits were proved to be false, however, the condemned were freed. After that, the Danish authorities were reluctant to <b>accept</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> charges of witchcraft. When the local court of Schelenburg condemned two women to be burned at the stake for witchcraft in 1708, the sentence was revoked by the high court.|$|R
50|$|In 1941, Japanese {{soldiers}} {{took over}} Penang and all Chinese schools {{were forced to}} close. After a tough 3 years and 8 months, World War II ended in 1945 and schools reopened.

50|$|At first, the Venezuelan {{government}} {{gave the}} refugees special permission {{to stay in}} the country temporarily, until new homes could be found for them in other Latin American countries, but they were banned from finding employment in any industry other than agriculture. Furthermore, the Venezuelan government made it clear that it would not <b>accept</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> refugees, unless they came through the proper channels. Later, President Contreras gave the refugees permission to remain in the country permanently. As result of which, the passengers of the Koenigstein and the Caribia became some of the founding members of Venezuela's Jewish community, as most Jewish emigration to Venezuela would occur after the war, in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R
50|$|The Germanic cavalry, {{although}} {{outnumbered by}} Caesar's Gallic horsemen, {{made the first}} attack, forcing the Romans to retreat. Caesar describes a characteristic battle-tactic they used, where a horsemen would leap down {{to their feet and}} stab enemy horses in the belly. Accusing them of violating the truce, Caesar refused to <b>accept</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> ambassadors, arresting some who came requesting a further truce, and led his full force against the Germanic camp. The Usipetes and Tencteri were thrown into disarray and forced to flee, pursued by Caesar's cavalry, to the confluence of the Rhine and Meuse. Many were killed attempting to cross the rivers. They found refuge {{on the other side of}} the Rhine amongst the Sicambri.|$|R

50|$|On 30 April 1945 the two Swedish ships Magdalena and Lillie Matthiessen, {{previously}} {{employed as}} support vessels for the White Bus evacuations, made a final rescue trip to Lübeck and back. Amongst the prisoners rescued were some {{transferred from the}} prison flotilla. On the evening of 2 May 1945 more prisoners, mainly women and children from the Stutthof and Mittelbau-Dora camps were loaded onto barges and brought out to the anchored vessels; although, as the Cap Arcona refused to <b>accept</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> prisoners, over eight hundred were returned to the beach at Neustadt {{in the morning of}} 3 May, where around five hundred were killed in their barges by machine-gunning, or beaten to death on the beach, their SS guards then seeking to make their escape unencumbered.|$|R
50|$|Sang Kuan Chun {{is an old}} kung fu master who {{is getting}} ready to retire from martial arts. But just as he is about to put up the kings {{signboard}} and call it quits, he receives a note alleging that he's not the best. Thus begins his journey for one last challenge with each of the Seven Grandmasters to prove his superiority. As Sang Kuan Chun and his three students travel from one challenge to the next, the foursome acquires a fifth—a young man named Siu Ying who wants desperately to train under master Sang Kuan Chun to avenge his father's death. So he tags along, despite the master's insistence that he will not <b>accept</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> students. Eventually we learn more about the master's past.|$|R
