According to the ASA, the celebrities had signed statements saying they had used the UK version {{for a few weeks}} one to three years earlier, but the advertisements gave the appearance that they had continued to benefit from it, so the viewer's complaint was upheld.|$|E

5|$|Steve Burdick {{is a local}} {{television}} news anchor who keeps his homosexuality private. He and his lover are tested for HIV and both test positive. Burdick struggles to keep himself together as his lover's health declines. When his lover dies, Burdick breaks down {{on the air and}} announces the death and that he too is HIV-positive. Station managers want to fire him, but his producer, Barbara Hudson, convinces the station that AIDS reportage is newsworthy and socially responsible. Burdick's pieces are tagged with <b>a</b> <b>viewer</b> discretion advisory. He continues to report until he begins to show symptoms of AIDS, at which time the station managers pull him off the air.|$|E
5|$|The {{animated}} miniseries {{was released}} on DVD in the United States on September 8, 2015 from Cartoon Network and Warner Home Video. The DVD release took place two months earlier on July 8 in Australia. The DVD features all ten episodes of the show, commentaries, the original pilot, alternate title cards, and deleted animatics. Other extras on the DVD include the Composer's Cut, an option wherein <b>a</b> <b>viewer</b> can watch the show with only the visuals and the background music; and the mini-documentary Behind Over the Garden Wall.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{four days}} before the {{theatrical}} release of the film, a workprint version of Halloween appeared online and was circulated around various BitTorrent sites. Upon hearing of the leaked copy, Zombie stated that whatever version had been leaked was an older version of the film, unlike what was about to be released in theaters. The leak of Zombie's workprint led to speculation that the film's box office success could be damaged, as director Eli Roth attributed the financial failure of his film, , to the leaking of a workprint version. Dark Horizons webmaster Garth Franklin noted that watching the workprint allows <b>a</b> <b>viewer</b> to see what was changed after test screenings of the film in June 2007. For example, one particular scene—the rape of one of the Smith's Grove female inmates—was replaced in the final version. Halloween was officially released on August 31, 2007, to 3,472 theaters in North America, giving it the widest release of any of the previous Halloween films.|$|E

5|$|The Burys {{travelled}} {{north as}} second-class {{passengers on the}} steamer Cambria. They arrived at Dundee {{on the evening of}} 20 January 1889, and the following morning they rented a room above a bar at 43 Union Street. The Burys stayed for only eight days before they moved on 29 January to a squat at 113 Prince's Street, a basement flat under a shop. William had obtained the key under false pretences by telling the letting agents that he was <b>a</b> <b>viewer</b> interested in renting the property. Meanwhile, Ellen found a job as a cleaner at a local mill, but she quit after a day. William continued to drink heavily, often with a decorator called David Walker, who was re-painting the public house frequented by William.|$|E
5|$|The factual {{accuracy}} of the series is often criticised by legal professionals and journalists; many of the decisions taken by Deed are unlikely to happen in a real court. The romanticised vision of the court system created by Newman caused a judge to issue a warning to a jury {{not to let the}} series influence their view of trials—referring to an episode where Deed flouts rules when called up for jury service. A complaint was made by <b>a</b> <b>viewer</b> about one episode claiming biased and incorrect information about the MMR vaccine, leading the BBC to unilaterally ban repeats of it in its original form. All six series (with the exception of the two banned episodes from Series Five) have been released on DVD in the UK.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} shows a {{large room}} in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid {{during the reign of}} King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velázquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velázquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where <b>a</b> <b>viewer</b> of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position {{similar to that of the}} viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velázquez is shown working on.|$|E

5|$|Many {{important}} events occur off-camera {{and there is}} no artificial exposition in the form of voice-over or flashbacks, with the exceptions of two flashbacks – one {{at the end of the}} pilot episode that replays a moment from earlier in the same episode and one at the end of the fourth season finale that shows a short clip of a character tutoring his younger brother earlier in the season. Thus, the viewer needs to follow every conversation closely to understand the ongoing story arc and the relevance of each character to it. Salon.com has described the show as novelistic in structure, with a greater depth of writing and plotting than other crime shows. Each season of The Wire consists of between ten and thirteen episodes which form several multi-layered narratives. Simon chose this structure with an eye towards long story arcs that draw <b>a</b> <b>viewer</b> in, which then results in a more satisfying payoff. He uses the metaphor of a visual novel in several interviews, describing each episode as a chapter, and has also commented that this allows a fuller exploration of the show's themes in time not spent on plot development.|$|E
5|$|The season one premiere on September 27, 2015, {{attracted}} 7.14 {{million viewers}} with a 1.9 rating among adults 18–49 to rank as the highest-rated scripted telecast on Sunday night opposite Sunday Night Football. It also built by 36% on its lead-in Blood & Oil, {{which had a}} 1.4 rating. The pilot episode was also a huge gainer for DVR playback, with over 5 million, a 79% rise for a total 3.4 rating among adults 18–49 and <b>a</b> <b>viewer</b> total of 12.15 million. The show continued to perform well during live viewing while registering strong gains in DVR playback, more than doubling several times in season one. The finale episode garnered 3.78 million viewers with a 1.0 rating among adults in the 18–49 demographic, with a DVR boost of 120% for a total 2.2 rating among adults 18–49 {{and a total of}} 6.70 million viewers. Overall, the first season averaged 8.05 million viewers with a 2.6 rating among adults in the 18–49 demographic. It was the third best new series of the season among the adults 18–49 demographic.|$|E

25|$|The {{functionality}} is {{only provided}} via a public API, {{which can be}} used by any application to provide screen sharing functionality. Windows Desktop Sharing API exposes two objects: RDPSession for the sharing session and RDPViewer for the viewer. Multiple viewer objects can be instantiated for one Session object. <b>A</b> <b>viewer</b> can either be a passive viewer, who is just able to watch the application like a screencast, or an interactive viewer, who is able to interact in real time with the remote application. The RDPSession object contains all the shared applications, represented as Application objects, each with Window objects representing their on-screen windows. Per-application filters capture the application Windows and package them as Window objects. <b>A</b> <b>viewer</b> must authenticate itself before it can connect to a sharing session. This is done by generating an Invitation using the RDPSession. It contains an authentication ticket and password. The object is serialized and sent to the viewers, who need to present the Invitation when connecting.|$|E
