40|$|In literature, {{in order}} to study the {{rheological}} properties of fresh concrete, the air content is mostly varied {{by means of the}} addition of <b>air-entraining</b> <b>agents.</b> As a result, no separation between the influence of the air bubbles themselves and the surfactant, which keeps the bubble stable, can be executed. by means of pumping, the air content in fresh concrete is gradually increased. Furthermore, a decrease in air bubbles size of around 1 order of magnitude has been observed.

If the Ca-number is much larger than 1, which is the case when studying the viscosity, the bubbles deform and decrease the flow resistance. For low Ca-numbers, for example when studying the yield stress, the bubbles remain spherical and increase the flow resistance. As a result, for small air bubbles, the yield stress has been found to increase, while the viscosity decreases. For larger air bubbles, the effect of air on the yield stress becomes unclear, resulting in a possible increase or decrease...|$|R

There is a growing interest in reducing the environmental impact and conserve limited natural resources.

Cementa has since many years, focused on reducing the environmental impact of cement production. The work has involved the entire production process from selection of alternative fuels to the development of cement with less clinker content. During 2013 / 2014, two new types of cement (Bascement and CEM II / B) will be introduced to the Swedish market. Cementa is also working to reduce cement use in concrete and this thesis is a part in this work. By developing better concrete proportioning tool based on {{a better understanding of the}} influence of the concrete constituents on the fresh concrete properties, cement consumption is reduced. The following report deals with new types of cement with less clinker content, where the clinker partially is replaced by fly ash, slag and limestone. As a reference, the study takes today's construction cement from Slite and Skövde. The study aims to find out how today´s construction cement and the new cement types differ in their rheological properties. Experiments have been conducted on mortar and concrete with different plasticizers and <b>air-entraining</b> <b>agents.</b> The study also addresses air-entrainment demand and open time of fresh concrete with new cement types.

Concrete mixes containing 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 60 % fly ash were evaluated in the laboratory in combination with various cement contents. Type C fly ash was selected from three local sources which had been approved by the department for concrete mixes. Also, specifications were developed for using fly ash in a paving project. In general, fly ash when used at replacement below 40 % by weight of cement was found to be satisfactory in concrete. In areas that the maximum possible strength loss cannot exceed 10 % of control, replacement rate of less than 25 % is recommended. Increasing amounts of fly ash caused a reduction in compressive strength, especially when <b>air-entraining</b> <b>agents</b> were used or when the concrete was less than 28 days old. Retardation in the set times was also noticed with increasing amounts of fly ash. However, strength gains of up to 10 % were noticed in some mixes after extended curing periods.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the pursuit of a better characterization method for the air voids - particularly air-entrained voids - in fresh cement-based materials through the use of ultrasonics. The use of <b>air-entraining</b> <b>agents</b> (AEA's) to incorporate a stable network of air voids into fresh cement paste is common practice in the concrete industry. These particular air voids significantly improve durability of hardened cement paste through mitigation of stresses associated with freezing and thawing cycles. It is understood that the performance of entrained air voids in cement paste is dependent on their size and distribution, or spacing factor. However, conventional methods for qualifying air content, such as the Pressure, Volume, and Gravimetric Methods, only measure total air volume and cannot assess size or spacing. In this investigation, using matched pairs of transducers, ultrasonic pulses were transmitted through fresh cement paste specimens (0. 0 % up to 0. 6 % AEA by weight of cement). The received signals were recorded every five minutes during the first six hours and then every fifteen minutes thereafter. Analysis shows strong distinctions between specimens with and those without the AEA. Further research is needed into the distinctions among specimens with the AEA. However, the data suggest correlations between Vicat setting times, heat of hydration, and autogenous strain and ultrasonic metrics such as pulse velocity and peak frequency of the signal. The findings of this research should be most appropriate as a foundation for an inversion process and improved air-entrainment detection methods. M. S.

Data from granulometry, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, optical microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence, mercury intrusion porosimetry, ultrasounds and accelerated aging tests were interpreted and compared. It was observed that high CO 2 concentrations favour a faster, more complete carbonation of lime mortars.

The mineralogy and texture of mortars varied {{depending on the type of}} additive used but the speed of the portlandite- calcite transformation did not change significantly. A fine layer of calcite microcrystals developed on the contact surface between the mortar and the brick (or the calcarenite).

This {{work is a}} result of studying the effect of different adding sequences of <b>air-entraining</b> <b>agents</b> (AEA) and superplasticizer (SP) on air content in mortar. The basis for work is a study of foam index change for different materials and adding sequences, carried out by a group of BSc students in spring 2015 [1]. Consequently, a set of experiments for materials of interest (2 different AEAs, 1 co-polymer SP, 1 OPC, 1 Norwegian fly ash and 1 limestone filler), used in the above mentioned study, were performed. The following parameters of the mix were selected: OPC/FA 70 / 30, mass of limestone 5 % of binder, w/c ratio 0, 45. Matrix volume was changed during the experiment from 330 to 400 litres. Whole range of received data is included in the report for a broader overview of the effect of AEA and SP mixing sequence. The results shows that, notwithstanding matrix volume and type of AEA used, sequence of adding admixtures has a significant influence on the air content in concrete both in fresh and hardened state. It is noted that when SP is added after AEA, the effect of AEA is reduced while in mixes where AEA is added after SP, the air content is higher, presumably due to adsorption of SP. The highest air content gives adding AEA together with SP. The appreciable difference in the air content is also noted for different AEAs, coming from different producers.

40|$|Pop-out and {{disaggregation}} of aggregate in a 1 -year old {{cement concrete}} pavement originally mixed with <b>air-entraining</b> (AE) water-reducing <b>agent</b> was observed after the pavement {{had been exposed}} to ethylene glycol based snow-melting agent on the surface in the winter. The study used: gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) tests, 1 H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) tests, X-ray fluorescence analysis, emission spectral analysis (ICP), elution tests in anion type surfactant solution conducted for mortar and aggregate taken from the cement concrete where pop-out had occurred, as well as samples made by cement paste in the laboratory. Tests of the tensile strength, thermal-stress, and three-dimensional crack analysis by micro-focus computerized tomography (CT) scanner were conducted for specimens (2. 5 2. 5 10 cm) taken from the cement concrete where pop-out had occurred and with cement concrete samples made in the laboratory. Microscope observations and Electron Probe Micro Analyzer (EPMA) analysis were conducted for thin samples (2. 5 2. 5 cm and 20 lm thick) taken from the cement concrete where pop-out had occurred. The tests results showed that organic compounds contained in the cement reacted with the cement during the hardening process, generating cracks and gel in the cement paste. It was established that these caused the pop-out of the aggregate, together with the effects of the ethylene glycol based snow-melting agent that the cement concrete {{had been exposed to}}. No pop-out or disaggregation of aggregate were found in cement concrete at a repaired section, at the same location, with aggregate of low absorbing water ratio in this cold region and in place for 2 years...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. According the test, {{this paper}} {{discussed}} {{the relationships among}} nano SiO 2 content of nano SiO 2 cement concrete,air content, water-cement ratio and frost resistance property. Meanwhile, the relationship among the bubble parameter, structure of holes and the frost resistance is primarily discussed. The {{results show that the}} concrete mixed with some nano SiO 2, with the increase of impervious holes in hardened cement paste, compared with ordinary concrete,both the ability of freezing-thawing resisting and compression strength will have an improvement. What’s more, when mixed with the <b>air-entraining</b> <b>agent,</b> freezing-thawing cycles number will have an obvious increase. When water-cement ratio is 0. 35 - 0. 39, the ability of frost resisting is very high but when water-cement ratio is larger than 0. 39, freezing-thawing resisting performance is substantial decline...|$|E
40|$|Neutron {{radiography}} (NR) {{was applied}} to study liquid transport processes in concrete. With this method, {{it is possible to}} monitor the liquid distribution inside specimens and to measure the height of the liquid front for liquids of high hydrogen content inside concrete. The experiment was performed with water and fuel oil for three different types of concrete. The results are compared with the sorptivity measured by the gravimetric method. It is shown that the ratio between the capillarity coefficient and sorptivity depends upon the combination of liquid and solid phases. For water, this value was found to be 5. 5 ± 0. 6, 5. 8 ± 0. 6 and 7. 1 ± 0. 7 in concrete without additives, concrete with an <b>air-entraining</b> <b>agent</b> and concrete with a plasticizer, respectively. For fuel oil, the value is about 50 % higher than that for water...|$|E
40|$|Delayed {{ettringite}} formation (DEF) is {{a chemical}} reaction with proven damaging effects on hydrated concrete. Ettringite crystals can cause cracks and their widening due to pressure on cracked walls {{caused by the}} positive volume difference in the reaction. Concrete may show improvements in strength at early ages but further growth of cracks causes widening and spreading through the concrete structure. In this study, finely dispersed crystallization nuclei achieved by adding <b>air-entraining</b> <b>agent</b> (AEA) and short vibration of specimens is presented as the main prerequisite for reducing DEF-induced deterioration of hydrated concrete. The study presents the method and mechanism for obtaining the required nucleation. Controlling long-term DEF by providing AEA-induced crystallisation nuclei, prevented excessive and rapid initial strength improvements, and resulted in a slight increase of compressive strength of fine grained concrete with only marginally lower density...|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{standards}} that evaluate the resistance of concrete against freeze-thaw cycles (FTC) {{are based on the}} loss of weight due to scaling. Such procedures are useful but do not provide information about the microstructural deterioration of the concrete. The test procedure needs to be stopped after several FTCs for weighing the loss of material by scaling. This paper proposes the use of mercury-intrusion-porosimetry and thermogravimetric analysis for assessing the microstructural damage of concrete during FTCs. Continuous strain measurement can be performed without stopping the FTCs. The combination of the above techniques with the freeze-thaw resistance standards provides better and more precise information about concrete damage. The proposed procedure is applied to an ordinary concrete, a concrete with silica fume addition and one with an <b>air-entraining</b> <b>agent.</b> The test results showed that the three techniques used are suitable and useful to be employed as complementary to {{the standards}}.

40|$|Increased frost {{resistance}} of concrete {{can be achieved}} by adding <b>air-entraining</b> <b>agent</b> to the fresh concrete mix. Adequate air entrainment is in practice usually checked by measuring total air content of fresh concrete. However, characteristics of air pore system, above all their number and distribution by size, rather than total air content are responsible for adequate {{frost resistance}} of concrete. Therefore aim of tests carried out in framework of my diploma was to analyze characteristics of air bubbles in hardened concrete with help of linear microscopical analyses (LMA) in accordance with SIST EN 480 - 11 : 2005. Main influencing parameters that were studied were consistency and total air content of fresh concrete. Also the comparison between spacing factor of air bubbles and amount of materials scaled from surface at salt-frost scaling test according to SIST 1026 have been made for particular concrete mix...|$|E
40|$|Double-layer renders were {{formulated}} {{for ensuring}} salt migration, ancient masonries conservation and environmental sustainability. Thus, {{natural hydraulic lime}} as binder and recycled aggregates from render wastes were selected. The properties were adjusted by adding an <b>air-entraining</b> <b>agent</b> in the inner layer and different percentages of water-repellent admixtures in the outer layer. The systems were applied on bricks and subjected to rising damp-evaporation cycles, for investigating their behaviour and properties in respect to NaCl migration. Mono-material prismatic render specimens were also studied. Water vapour permeability, capillary absorption, drying behaviour, compressive strength, mechanical resistance, conductivity and porosity of each formulation were evaluated. Good durability was observed whenever the render layers had different microstructure, either there was salts deposition within the lower layer,or if there was efflorescences formation. If the layers had similar structure, deposition of salt at the brick-render interface occurred causing damages to the substrate...|$|E
