5000|$|Jesse Beams {{from the}} University of Virginia filed {{some of the}} {{earliest}} <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearing</b> patents [...] during World War II. The patents dealt with ultracentrifuges intended for the enrichment of isotopes of elements needed for the Manhattan Project. However, magnetic bearings did not mature until advances in solid-state electronics and modern computer-based control technology with the work of Habermann and Schweitzer. In 1987, Estelle Croot further improved <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearing</b> technology, but these designs were not manufactured due to expensive costs of production, which used a laser guidance system. Estelle Croot's research was the subject of 3 Australian patents http://www.ipaustralia.com.au/applicant/croot-estelle/patents/ and was funded by Nachi Fujikoshi, Nippon Seiko KK and Hitachi, and her calculations were used in other technologies that used rare earth magnets but the active magnetic bearings were only developed to the prototype stage.|$|E

50|$|Starting from 1996 the Dutch oil and {{gas company}} NAM {{installed}} {{over a period of}} 10 years 20 large E-motor driven (with variable speed drive) gas compressors of 23 MW fully equipped with <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> on both the E-motor and the compressor. These compressors are used in the Groningen gas field to extract the remaining gas from this large gas field and to increase the field capacity. The motor-compressor design was done by Siemens and the <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> were delivered by Waukesha Bearings (owned by Dover Corporation). (Originally these bearings were designed by Glacier, this company was later taken over by Federal Mogul and is now part of Waukesha <b>Bearings.)</b> By using <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> and a direct drive between motor and compressor (without the gearbox in between) and applying dry gas seals, a full dry-dry (oil free) system has been installed. Applying <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> in the driver and in the compressor (compared to the traditional configuration with a gearbox, plain bearings and a gasturbine-driver) results in a relatively simple system with a very wide operating range and high efficiencies (particularly at partial load).

These elements are shown in the diagram. The power amplifiers supply equal bias current to two pairs of electromagnets on opposite sides of a rotor.

50|$|Passive {{magnetic}} bearings use {{permanent magnets}} and, therefore, {{do not require}} any input power but are difficult to design due to the limitations described by Earnshaw's theorem. Techniques using diamagnetic materials are relatively undeveloped and strongly depend on material characteristics. As a result, most magnetic bearings are active magnetic bearings, using electromagnets which require continuous power input and an active control system to keep the load stable. In a combined design, permanent magnets are often used to carry the static load and the <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearing</b> is used when the levitated object deviates from its optimum position. Magnetic bearings typically require a back-up bearing {{in the case of}} power or control system failure.|$|E
50|$|Kasarda {{reviews the}} history of active {{magnetic}} bearings in depth. She notes that the first commercial application of active magnetic bearings was in turbomachinery. The <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearing</b> allowed the elimination of oil reservoirs on compressors for the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) gas pipelines in Alberta, Canada. This reduced the fire hazard allowing a substantial reduction in insurance costs. The success of these magnetic bearing installations led NGTL to pioneer {{the research and development}} of a digital magnetic bearing control system as a replacement for the analog control systems supplied by the American company Magnetic Bearings Inc. In 1992, NGTL's magnetic bearing research group formed the company Revolve Technologies Inc. http://www.skfmagneticbearings.com for commercializing the digital magnetic bearing technology. The company was later purchased by SKF of Sweden. The French company S2M, founded in 1976, was the first to commercially market active magnetic bearings. Extensive research on magnetic bearings continues at the University of Virginia in the Rotating Machinery and Controls Industrial Research Program http://www.virginia.edu/romac/.|$|E
40|$|<b>Active</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Bearings</b> (AMB) {{have many}} {{advantages}} such as no friction loss, no abrasion, lubricationfree quality, {{and used for}} high rotational speed applications. A complete AMB system consists of an actuator, power amplifier, a rotor position sensor and a control system. In this paper, a closed loop decentralized Fuzzy Logic controller for <b>Active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>Bearings</b> is designed. For the numerical evaluation of control algorithm a MIMO (multiple input multiple output) mathematical model of the controlled plant is determined. The majority of industrial applications of <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> were still based on conventional PID control system. The proposed control design is based on rule based procedure.

In the paper, an identification procedure of bearing response forces, which allows for simultaneous measurement of the journal position with respect to the bush and the control currents that flow in <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearing</b> bush windings, is presented. The proposed procedure ensures effective protection of the rotating shaft supported in <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> against too high loads and displacements that can occur in the rotating system.

40|$|An {{advanced}} thrust-measurement system utilizes <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> to both (1) levitate {{a floating}} frame in all {{six degrees of}} freedom and (2) measure the levitation forces between the floating frame and a grounded frame. This system was developed for original use in measuring the thrust exerted by a rocket engine mounted on the floating frame, but can just as well be used in other force-measurement applications. This system offers several advantages over prior thrust-measurement systems based on mechanical support by flexures and/or load cells: The system includes multiple <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> for each degree of freedom, so that by selective use of one, some, or all of these bearings, it is possible to test a given article over a wide force range in the same fixture, eliminating the need to transfer the article to different test fixtures to obtain the benefit of full-scale accuracy of different force-measurement devices for different force ranges. Like other <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings,</b> the <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> of this system include closed-loop control subsystems, through which the stiffness and damping characteristics of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> can be modified electronically. The design of the system minimizes or eliminates cross-axis force-measurement errors. The <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> are configured to provide support against movement along all three orthogonal Cartesian axes, and such that the support along a given axis does not produce force along any other axis. Moreover, by eliminating the need for such mechanical connections as flexures used in prior thrust-measurement systems, magnetic levitation of the floating frame eliminates what would otherwise be major sources of cross-axis forces and the associated measurement errors. Overall, relative to prior mechanical-support thrust-measurement systems, this system offers greater versatility for adaptation to a variety of test conditions and requirements. The basic idea of most prior active-magnetic-bearing force-measurement systems is to calculate levitation forces on the basis of simple proportionalities between changes in those forces and changes in feedback-controlled currents applied to levitating electromagnetic coils. In the prior systems, the effects of gap lengths on fringing magnetic fields and the concomitant effects on magnetic forces were neglected. In the present system, the control subsystems of the <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> are coupled with a computer-based automatic calibration system running special-purpose software wherein gap-length-dependent fringing factors are applied to current and magnetic-flux-based force equations and combined with a multipoint calibration method to obtain greater accuracy...|$|R
50|$|Porjus {{power station}} (Porjus kraftverk) {{is one of}} the oldest and largest power plants in Sweden, {{situated}} near Porjus. It was built 1910-1915 and has a power of 480 MW. Besides three-phase AC, the plant originally also generated single phase 15 Hz AC for railway traction and hence, two single-phase 80 kV power lines ran along the Iron Ore Line Malmbanan where it was transformed down to 16 kV in substations. However this system was later abandoned in favor of rotary converter stations. The original machines for single phase AC were subsequently scrapped.The construction of the Porjus power station out in the wilderness is considered a pioneering achievement. The material for the founding work had to be carried in backpacks over a 44 km (3000 feet) trail in uninhabited land before any infrastructure was built. In the early 1970s, a new power station was built but the old monumental brick building has been kept as a cultural heritage site with most of the machinery intact, with Vattenfall doing daily tours for visitors during the summertime. The station is actually the third largest. In 2016, its 10 MW generator was upgraded with a fast <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearing</b> for testing.|$|E

40|$|The <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> {{present a}} new {{technology}} which has many advantages compared to traditional <b>bearing</b> designs. <b>Active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings,</b> however, require retainer bearings order to prevent damages {{in the event of}} a component, power or a control loop failure.

In this work an attempt has been made for the complete levitation of a rotor weighing 4 kg, supported on two radial <b>active</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> and two axial passive <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> (PMB) resulting in 5 -axes levitation. The active bearings working {{in the mode of}} attraction make the system inherently unstable.

Design of the feedback controller is based on direct output feedback control scheme, which makes the controller design easier and implementation of the controller hardware becomes simpler.
