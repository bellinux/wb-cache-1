5|$|An oil sketch {{attributed}} to Etty, given to York Art Gallery in 1952 by Judith Hare, Countess of Listowel and entitled Three Female Nudes, is possibly a preliminary study by Etty for Youth <b>and</b> <b>Pleasure,</b> or a copy {{by a student}} of the three central figures. Art historian Sarah Burnage considers both possibilities unlikely, as neither the arrangement of figures, the subject matter or the sea serpent approaching the group appear to relate to the completed Youth <b>and</b> <b>Pleasure,</b> and considers it more likely to be a preliminary sketch for a now-unknown work.|$|E
5|$|Youth on the Prow, <b>and</b> <b>Pleasure</b> at the Helm (also {{known as}} Fair Laughs the Morn and Youth <b>and</b> <b>Pleasure)</b> is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1832 and currently in Tate Britain. Etty {{had been planning}} the painting since 1818–19, and an early version was exhibited in 1822. The piece {{was inspired by a}} metaphor in Thomas Gray's poem The Bard in which the apparently bright start to the notorious misrule of Richard II of England was compared to a gilded ship whose occupants are unaware of an approaching storm. Etty chose to illustrate Gray's lines literally, depicting a golden boat filled with and surrounded by nude and near-nude figures.|$|E
5|$|After {{rounding}} Widmouth Head, {{the path}} passes 'The Coastguard Cottages' in Hele Bay {{and enters the}} seaside resort of Ilfracombe, with its small harbour, surrounded by cliffs. A seasonal foot passenger ferry service runs from the harbour to Lundy Island, and the Balmoral, the Waverley <b>and</b> <b>pleasure</b> boats ply to Porthcawl near Swansea. From Ilfracombe to Bideford the Tarka Trail coincides with the South West Coast Path.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} was bought in 1832 by Robert Vernon to {{form part of}} his collection of British art. Vernon donated his collection, including Youth on the Prow, <b>and</b> <b>Pleasure</b> at the Helm, to the National Gallery in 1847, which, in turn, transferred it to the Tate Gallery in 1949. It remains one of Etty's best-known works, and formed part of major exhibitions at Tate Britain in 2001–02 and at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12.|$|E
5|$|When Etty {{exhibited}} {{the completed painting}} at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1832, it was shown untitled, with the relevant six lines from The Bard attached; writers at the time sometimes referred to it by its incipit of Fair Laughs the Morn. By the time of Etty's death in 1849, it had acquired its present title of Youth on the Prow, <b>and</b> <b>Pleasure</b> at the Helm.|$|E
5|$|Greyhounds were {{introduced}} in the Americas for sport <b>and</b> <b>pleasure,</b> they helped farmers control jackrabbits, and organised coursing meets were {{taking place in the}} United States in the 19th century, by 1886 according to Gulf Coast Greyhounds. Open field coursing of jackrabbits, which are members of the hare family, now takes place {{in a number of states}} in Western America, including California, Montana and Wyoming, and is said by the North American Coursing Association to take place also in Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah. It takes place with up to four dogs chasing the hare.|$|E

Cunningham Lake offers a small marina where rental boats are available.|$|E
5|$|Needled by {{repeated}} {{attacks from}} the press on his supposed indecency, poor taste and lack of creativity, Etty changed his approach after the response to Youth on the Prow, <b>and</b> <b>Pleasure</b> at the Helm. He exhibited over 80 further paintings at the Royal Academy alone, and remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from this time made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons. He died in November 1849 and, while his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity, interest in him declined over time, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century all of his paintings had fallen below their original prices.|$|E
5|$|Outside of breed-specific shows, the Saddlebred is also {{promoted}} as suitable for competitive trail riding, endurance riding, dressage, combined driving, eventing, and show jumping. Some Saddlebreds are also suitable for fox hunting, cutting and roping. Because {{they are so}} closely affiliated with their traditional show ring competition, they are sometimes mistaken for warmbloods or Thoroughbred crosses when participating in other equine events. They are also suitable family horses used for trail <b>and</b> <b>pleasure</b> riding and ranch work.|$|E

5|$|The 1832 {{exhibition}} of Youth on the Prow, <b>and</b> <b>Pleasure</b> at the Helm, a painting containing apparently gratuitous nude figures, met a hostile reception from critics. From then on, while Etty continued to paint nude {{figures for the}} rest of his career, he made a conscious effort to try to illustrate moral lessons with his work. This effort was not wholly successful, and he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some throughout his career. He died in late 1849, and following his death nude paintings went rapidly out of fashion in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The Aire and Calder {{was built}} for {{commercial}} freight, and although the volume carried has dropped significantly, particularly since coal deliveries to Ferrybridge power station by canal stopped, the navigation still carried 300,000 tonnes of freight in 2007, down from 1.64 million tonnes in 2000. The Leeds to Castleford section {{and much of the}} Wakefield branch are now mainly used as leisure routes, but below Castleford, the industrial nature of the waterway is more obvious, <b>and</b> <b>pleasure</b> boats must give way to commercial vessels. 600 tonne vessels, designed to make maximum use of the locks, produce considerable wash, and are not as manoeuvrable as a narrow boat.|$|E
5|$|The breed was {{originally}} developed for general {{use on the}} farms of the Appalachian foothills, where it was found pulling plows and buggies, working cattle and being ridden by both adults and children. Today, it is still used for working cattle, as well as endurance riding <b>and</b> <b>pleasure</b> riding. The breed's gait and disposition make it sought out by elderly and disabled riders. Each September, the Kentucky Horse Park hosts the International Rocky Mountain Horse Show.|$|E
