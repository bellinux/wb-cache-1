5|$|McKenna {{grew up in}} Hackensack, New Jersey {{and upon}} {{graduating from high school}} entered the Medical Mission Sisters, a Roman Catholic {{organization}} of women dedicated to improving world access to health care. She earned a bachelor's degree in English from Chestnut Hill College, then a small Catholic women's college, and a master's degree in liturgy from Notre Dame University before moving on to the University of Pennsylvania and earning a doctorate in Christian origins and religious thought. For her doctorate thesis, she traveled to Israel for the clarity <b>and</b> <b>solitude.</b>|$|E
5|$|Within the verse, Coleridge {{seeks to}} {{discover}} the environment that his friends are exploring because {{he is unable to}} join them. The poem links the lime-tree bower to the Quantocks where the Wordsworths, Lamb and Fricker were out walking. Although he is separated from them, the poet connects to his distant friends and they are able to share in a common view on life. The poem describes Coleridge's loneliness <b>and</b> <b>solitude</b> throughout, yet he is glad that his friends are able to experience nature. Because of this, he is able to tolerate his prison, which he views as merely physical rather than intellectual.|$|E
5|$|Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a {{child and}} was serious, quiet and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became {{depressed}} after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion, and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health <b>and</b> <b>solitude</b> before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially, and the two kept up a long correspondence by letter. His early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of olive trees, wheat fields and sunflowers.|$|E

25|$|Abraham the Great {{had started}} a monastic reform {{movement}} which Babai and other disciples carried through. Since Bar Sauma and the Synod of Beth Lapat, monks and nuns had been encouraged to marry. When Babai returned to Mt. Izla in 604, he expelled monks that lived with women {{on the fringes of}} the monastery, and enforced strict discipline, emphasizing a deep life of prayer <b>and</b> <b>solitude.</b> The result was a mass exodus, not only of the married monks.|$|E
25|$|Nueva trova had {{its heyday}} in the 1970s, but was already declining {{before the fall}} of the Soviet Union. Examples of non-political styles in the nueva trova {{movement}} can be found, for example, Liuba María Hevia whose lyrics are focused on more traditional subjects such as love <b>and</b> <b>solitude,</b> sharing with the rest a highly poetical style. On {{the other side of the}} spectrum, Carlos Varela is famous in Cuba for his open criticism of some aspects of Castro's revolution.|$|E

25|$|Jean-Pierre Rives met {{his first}} wife, an American model and singer/songwriter Jennifer Taylor, in Paris, {{in the early}} 1980s. The {{marriage}} ended in a divorce. He has since remarried and fathered two sons – Jasper and Kino-Jean. Rives and his wife, Sonia, split their time between Ibiza and St-Tropez, where {{they live in a}} wooden family home that resembles a tree house. The property is located near a local golf course and includes a luscious garden, with a bamboo grove, mimosa bushes, and lemon and fig trees. He loves life on the Mediterranean, where he can paint and sculpt in peace <b>and</b> <b>solitude.</b>|$|E
25|$|In June 1868 she {{relocated}} to Lima in Peru at {{the advice of}} her new Franciscan spiritual director Pedro Gual where she lived in the Dominican convent at Patrocinio despite not being a nun. It was here that she followed a demanding schedule of eight hours of reflection which was offered in silence <b>and</b> <b>solitude.</b> In addition she devoted four {{hours of the night}} to various forms of mortification which included flagellation and the wearing of a crown of thorns. In terms of nourishment she fasted on bread and water alone and took the Eucharist as her sole form of sustenance while was sometimes seen in an ecstatic state.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} few years, however, {{researchers}} like Robert J. Coplan and Julie C. Bowker have bucked the trend that solitary practices <b>and</b> <b>solitude</b> are inherently dysfunctional and undesirable. In their groundbreaking work The Handbook of Solitude, the authors note how solitude can allow for enhancements in self-esteem, generates clarity, and can be highly therapeutic. In the edited work, Coplan and Bowker invite not only fellow psychology colleagues to chime in on this issue, but they also invite {{a variety of other}} faculty from different disciplines to address the issue. Arguably the most interesting of these alternative views comes from Fong's chapter on how solitude {{is more than just a}} personal trajectory for one to take inventory on life; it also yields a variety of important sociological cues that allow the protagonist to navigate through society, even highly politicized societies. In the process, political prisoners in solitary confinement were examined to see how they concluded their views on society. Thus Fong, Coplan, and Bowker conclude that a person's experienced solitude generates immanent and personal content as well as collective and sociological content, depending on context.|$|E

60|$|Alfred, therefore, after disentangling {{himself from}} {{all but one}} or two {{trustworthy}} and faithful friends, wandered on toward the west, through forests, <b>and</b> <b>solitudes,</b> <b>and</b> wilds, to get {{as far away as}} possible from the enemies who were upon his track. He arrived at last on the remote western frontiers of his kingdom, at a place whose name has been immortalized by its having been for some time the place of his retreat. It was called Athelney.[1] Athelney was, however, scarcely deserving of a name, for it was nothing but a small spot of dry land {{in the midst of a}} morass, which, as grass would grow upon it in the openings among the trees, a simple cow-herd had taken possession of, and built his hut there.|$|R
25|$|The governess {{occupied}} a uniquely awkward {{position in the}} Victorian household, because she was neither a servant nor yet {{a member of the}} host family. She worked in the upper-class home of the landed gentry or aristocracy. She herself had a middle-class background and education, yet was paid for her services. As a sign of this social limbo she frequently ate on her own, away {{from the rest of the}} family and servants. By definition, a governess was an unmarried woman who lived in someone else's home, which meant that she was subject to their rules. In any case, she had to maintain an impeccable reputation by avoiding anything which could embarrass or offend her employers. If a particular governess was young and attractive, the lady of the house might well perceive a potential threat to her marriage, and enforce the governess' social exclusion more rigorously. As a result of these various restrictions, the lifestyle of the typical Victorian governess was often one of social isolation <b>and</b> <b>solitude,</b> without the opportunity to make friends. The fact that her presence in the household was underpinned by an employment contract emphasized that she could never truly be part of the host family.|$|E

The novel is about a precious necklace, which is called the Naulahka. When Kipling settled in his house in Dummerston, Vermont, he named it Naulakha, after the pavilion. To him, Naulakha symbolised the virtues, peacefulness, <b>and</b> <b>solitude</b> of the rural Vermont.|$|E

500|$|In 2003, Kiarostami {{directed}} Five, {{a poetic}} feature that contained no dialogue or characterisation whatsoever. The movie consists of five single-take long {{shots of the}} natural landscape along {{the shores of the}} Caspian Sea. Although the film lacks a clear storyline, Geoff Andrew argues that the film is [...] "more than just pretty pictures": [...] "assembled in order, they comprise a kind of abstract or emotional narrative arc, which moves evocatively from separation <b>and</b> <b>solitude</b> to community, from motion to rest, near-silence to sound and song, light to darkness and back to light again, ending on a note of rebirth and regeneration." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Chéreau {{shifted from}} theatre to opera, ... a scandalous reinterpretation of Wagner’s Ring at Bayreuth ... He reached {{the height of}} his career during his many years at the Théâtre des Amandiers in Nanterre, where he {{developed}} a new model of expression, discovered and launched one of the great dramatists of our time, Bernard Marie Koltès, whose major works he directed, including Combat de nègre et de chiens <b>and</b> <b>Solitude</b> des champs de coton, as well as Shakespeare, Peer Gynt, Heiner Müller, and the historic revival of Les paravents by Genet. Chéreau eventually turned to cinema, which he found more expressive of the truth of life that he so values.|$|E
500|$|The {{poems in}} this volume, like her poems in other volumes and contexts, contain {{universal}} identifications with ordinary objects. [...] For example, [...] "The Telephone" [...] describes {{her relationship with}} an object, and how it has intruded upon the silence <b>and</b> <b>solitude</b> of her life. [...] In this poem, which is three structured stanzas long, Angelou demands that the telephone ring, despite her resentment of its intrusion and her dependency upon it. [...] She uses familiar and feminine metaphors, and themes also found in blues songs, such as the colors black and blue and weekend loneliness. [...] In the poem [...] "Poor Girl", Angelou uses the vernacular to express universal themes, {{in the voice of}} a teenage girl who has lost her boyfriend.|$|E
