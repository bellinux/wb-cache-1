Moreover, on-line video commercials are rarely seen in marketing survey. To solve the insufficient product information problem, this study integrates the eye tracking system to offer more precise data {{in addition to the}} multiple perspective views in the 2 -dimensioal web <b>analytical</b> <b>system.</b> For commercial image test, video files are added in the web <b>analytical</b> <b>system</b> The web technique and quantitative analytical method are expected to help enterprises in their consumer attitude and image evaluation through video commercials. Through the web <b>analytical</b> <b>system,</b> the image and target user group preference analysis can be conducted for the references of marketing. In this study, four motorbike brands, SYM, KYMCO, YAMAHA, PGO, are used for the image preference survey. Through such a web <b>analytical</b> <b>system,</b> the coordinate values for the video commercials can be obtained for product positioning analysis in real time to select a proper video commercial with better image perceptions for further development. The survey verifies the suitability and feasibility of integrating video files with multiple views in the web <b>analytical</b> <b>system.</b> This will upgrade the total function and service of the web <b>analytical</b> <b>system</b> in new product design and marketing commercial development...|$|R

First, an HPLC method was developed and validated to determine A, MA, and HA in raw and processed Caowu and Chuanwu. Then an automated <b>analytical</b> <b>system</b> and ESI/MS/MS were applied to analyze these alkaloids and their semihydrolyzed products. The results obtained from automated <b>analytical</b> <b>system</b> are identical to those from ESI/MS/MS, which indicated that the method is a convenient and rapid tool for the qualitative analysis of herbal preparations. Furthermore, HA was little hydrolyzed by heating processes and thus it might account more for the toxicity of processed aconites. Hence, HA {{could be used as}} an indicator when one alkaloid is required as a reference to monitor the quality of raw and processed Chuanwu and Caowu. In addition, the raw and processed Chuanwu and Caowu can be distinguished by monitoring the ratio of A and MA to HA...|$|R
