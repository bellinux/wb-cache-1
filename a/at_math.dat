500|$|Casey entered West Point in 1915, {{where his}} best friend and roommate was Lucius D. Clay. At West Point, Casey played {{football}} as a halfback, substituting for Elmer Oliphant. One of Casey's duties was tutoring Oliphant in mathematics. Casey decided that winning games {{was more important than}} playing, and he helped keep Oliphant proficient <b>at</b> <b>math.</b> Unlike most appointees to West Point, a grateful Casey wrote frequently to Griffin about his progress and sent him football tickets. When Casey's younger brother Martin Charles Casey wanted to enter West Point, Griffin directly appointed him to the class of 1920 without having to pass the examination. Martin served with the coastal artillery for eleven years before being medically discharged due to migraine headaches on 30 November 1931. Martin later became a successful lawyer. Both brothers acquired the nickname [...] "Pat" [...] at West Point.|$|E
500|$|Sean Gregory of Time {{wrote of}} Lin's zero Division I {{scholarship}} offers: [...] " [...] was scrawny, but don't doubt {{that a little}} racial profiling, intentional or otherwise, contributed to his underrecruitment." [...] Diepenbrock stated, [...] "If [...] was African American or Caucasian, {{it might have been}} a different deal"; he did not think Lin's race affected his recruiting until later seeing 10 Division I coaches express interest in a black student who Diepenbrock assessed as [...] "a nice junior college player". Lin said: [...] "I'm not saying top-5 state automatically gets you offers, but I do think [...] did affect the way coaches recruited me. I think if I were a different race, I would've been treated differently." [...] Walters added, [...] "People who don't think stereotypes exist are crazy. If [...] white, he's either a good shooter or heady. If he's Asian, he's good <b>at</b> <b>math.</b> We're not taking him." [...] During Lin's college career, fewer than 0.5% of men's Division 1 basketball players were Asian-American.|$|E
2500|$|Walker {{was born}} in Putnam County, Georgia, the {{youngest}} of eight children, to African-American sharecroppers Willie Lee Walker and Minnie Lou Tallulah Grant. Her father, who was, in her words, [...] "wonderful <b>at</b> <b>math</b> but a terrible farmer," [...] earned only $300 ($4,000 in 2013 dollars) a year from sharecropping and dairy farming. Her mother supplemented the family income by working as a maid. The family also had Native American ancestry, which Walker drew from in her writing and spirituality. Minnie Lou worked 11 {{hours a day for}} $17 per week to help pay for Alice to attend college.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{suggests}} that claims about psychological sex differences having biological causes underlie {{the negative effects}} of stereotype threat. Two studies in maths performance found that stereotype threat effects were only seen when it was explicitly claimed that the gender gap in performance was a result of genetic factors. Furthermore, believing that males are hardwired to be better <b>at</b> <b>math</b> or any particular field reinforces the idea both that such abilities are [...] "gifted" [...] rather than earned, and that females need to work much harder because they do not possess this innate ability. An intervention study by Columbia and NYU psychologists challenged the ‘fixed’ view of intelligence and eliminated the gender gap in maths performance. Specifically, seventh grade students in the experimental conditions were encouraged either to view intelligence as malleable or to attribute academic difficulties to the novelty of middle school. Results showed that females in experimental conditions achieved significantly higher math standardized test scores than those in the control group.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was born}} Max Harrison, the {{youngest}} child and only son of Benjamin Harrison (February 1868 – 1933) and Pauline Harrison (July 1870–?), Jewish immigrants from Lithuania (then the Russian Empire). Max {{grew up in}} New York City, first in lower Manhattan and later the Bronx, with three sisters, who doted on “the baby” of the family. As a young child Max decided to replace his birth name with [...] "Robert." [...] Early on Robert appeared magnanimous, if only due to a tendency to quickly forget slights as he could be not bothered {{to focus on the}} negative. In school he did poorly <b>at</b> <b>math</b> but well at English. He wanted to write for a living. At the age of 12 he authored and published a travel guide to roadside inns, Harrison's Weekend Guide. After the printer refused to give Harrison his share of the profits, Harrison formed a belief that one could only trust family members, whom he would later employ in various publishing projects. But years later, his generous nature would lead him to make an exception {{at the height of his}} success with an ex-McCarthyite editor with deadly repercussions.|$|E
2500|$|Actress Bebe Neuwirth left Cheers {{for fear}} of {{becoming}} typecast and to do theatre (mostly Broadway); she {{did not expect to}} appear recurrently in Frasier. Cheers and Frasier writers Ken Levine and David Isaacs found chemistry of Frasier and Lilith [...] "special" [...] enough to compare them with Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy on Prozac. In [...] "The Show Where Lilith Comes Back" [...] (1994), Lilith surprises Frasier by dialing to the radio show. They later make love in a hotel room, but end up regretting it, prompting them to part ways again. They decide to remain friends and help each other raise their son Frederick (Trevor Einhorn), who also appears occasionally in this spin-off. In [...] "Adventures in Paradise, Part Two" [...] (1994), Lilith gets engaged to her fiancé Brian (James Morrison), much to Frasier's dismay. In [...] "A Lilith Thanksgiving" [...] (1996), Frasier and Lilith have Frederick admitted into a private school after they annoy the administrator (Paxton Whitehead) several times on Thanksgiving. In [...] "The Unnatural" [...] (1997), Frasier is proven as unathletic and bad at softball, which he reluctantly admits to Frederick. Then Frasier tells him that, when Frasier was a third-grade elementary student, Martin was bad <b>at</b> <b>math.</b>|$|E
