500|$|On {{the morning}} of 18 January 1386, Dame Nicole de Carrouges {{departed}} her chateau at Capomesnil for the neighbouring town of Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives where she had legal business to attend to. Although the journey was only a short one, she apparently took {{some or all of}} the household servants with her, leaving her daughter-in-law unattended during the day. Marguerite's testimony then alleged that a man-at-arms named Adam Louvel knocked on the chateau door, which Marguerite opened herself in the absence of servants. According to Marguerite, Louvel then made enquiries about a loan he owed Jean de Carrouges before suddenly announcing that Jacques Le Gris was outside the door and insisted on seeing her. At her refusal, Louvel exclaimed that [...] "he loves you passionately, he will do <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> and he greatly desires to see you". Although Marguerite protested, Le Gris then forced his way into the house and propositioned her, offering money if she would remain silent of their affair. When Marguerite refused, Le Gris then violently raped her with the aid of Louvel and threatened her not to tell anyone what had occurred on pain of death.|$|E

2500|$|In 1989, the group's {{name was}} dropped, and Estefan has been {{credited}} {{as a solo}} artist ever since. In 1988, after the worldwide chart success of single [...] "Anything for You", her Let it Loose album was repackaged as <b>Anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>You.</b>|$|E
2500|$|However, {{recording}} did {{not begin}} until April 2010. Friend and Pretty. Odd. producer Rob Mathes was [...] "like family" [...] to Smith and Urie, inspiring them to be excited to record despite the duo's initial beginning. He encouraged them to love the work they do, and [...] "... Just {{get out of bed}} in the morning, don’t loathe the things that you actually love doing, because it’s just going to keep you down," [...] for which Urie recalled the band [...] "owed a lot" [...] for. After working with the demos produced during the summer with Feldmann for several months afterward, the duo decided they weren't satisfactory, so the band started over with new material. The biggest difference for the band was that it was now half the previous band, with Urie and Smith writing everything. The album was produced by Feldmann and Butch Walker. Urie recalled that they were initially nervous to experiment with new producers, but instead regarded Feldmann and Walker's input positively, regarding their help as [...] "Hey, this is your record, I want to help you with your ideas. So you bring me the ideas, and we’ll help you do that. I don’t want to write <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> this is your record, it has to be your voice." [...] The band continued working with Feldmann for four months in early 2010, later going to Walker to finalize and improve the songs.|$|E
