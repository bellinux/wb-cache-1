5|$|Breaking Benjamin is an American {{rock band}} from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, founded in 1999 by lead singer and guitarist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel. The first lineup {{of the band}} also {{included}} guitarist Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski. This lineup released two albums, Saturate (2002) <b>and</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> Not Alone (2004), before Hummel was replaced by Chad Szeliga in 2005. The band released two more studio albums, Phobia (2006) and Dear Agony (2009), before entering an extended hiatus in early 2010 due to Burnley's recurring illnesses.|$|E

It will be a long job, but we are sure there is a future for angling in the river.|$|E

25|$|However, {{this is not}} {{a normal}} time <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not {{permitted}} to ignore reality. Searing criticism rightly branded as delegitimization of Israel is truly dangerous, all the more painfully so when it comes from Jews.

25|$|It is {{not easy}} to speak in {{adequate}} praise of this composition. The variety and beauty of the airs strike the most uninformed as forcibly as the most classical ear, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> persuaded that they will all find their way to the English Theatre, and strike John Bull as pleasantly as they have the more refined taste of the Italian cognoscenti.|$|E

25|$|When {{there is}} a talk about women and Buddhism, I have noticed that people often regard the topic as {{something}} new and different. They believe that women in Buddhism has become an important topic because we live in modern times and so many women are practicing the Dharma now. However, {{this is not the}} case. The female sangha has been here for centuries. We are not bringing something new into a 2,500-year-old tradition. The roots are there, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> simply re-energizing them.|$|E
25|$|You {{always told}} us to remain here {{and take care of}} our lands.

We must compare our father's conduct to a fat animal, that carries its tail upon its back, but when affrighted, it drops it between its legs and runs off.|$|E
25|$|Some theorists {{argue that}} the {{capacity}} of working memory decreases as we age, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> able to hold less information. In this theory, declines in working memory are described {{as the result of}} limiting the amount of information an individual can simultaneously keep active, so that a higher degree of integration and manipulation of information is not possible because the products of earlier memory processing are forgotten before the subsequent products.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} {{argument against}} free will, according to philosopher J. J. C. Smart {{focuses on the}} implications of determinism for 'free will'. However, he suggests free will is denied whether determinism is true or not. On one hand, if determinism is true, all our actions are predicted <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> assumed not to be free; on the other hand, if determinism is false, our actions are presumed to be random and as such we do not seem free because we had no part in controlling what happened.|$|E
25|$|Otherwise, {{suppose we}} have m vectors of n coordinates, with m<n. Then A is an n×m matrix and Λ is a column vector with m entries, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> again {{interested}} in AΛ= 0. As we saw previously, this {{is equivalent to}} a list of n equations. Consider the first m rows of A, the first m equations; any solution of the full list of equations must also be true of the reduced list. In fact, if 〈i1,...,i'm〉 is any list of m rows, then the equation must be true for those rows.|$|E
25|$|With the {{offensive}} already {{bogged down in}} unseasonably early wet weather, French (14 August 1917) claimed to Riddell (managing director of the News of the World, and likely to pass on French's views to Lloyd George) that Robertson was “anxious to get {{the whole of the}} military power into his own hands, that he is a capable organiser but not a great soldier, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> suffering from a lack of military genius”. Lloyd George suggested that all Robertson’s plans be submitted to a committee of French, Wilson and one other, although Wilson thought this “ridiculous and unworkable”.|$|E
60|$|The Mist, being broad of beam, was {{comfortable}} and roomy.
