While the storm was located in the Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Center issued a Hurricane Warning from Cameron to Morgan City, Louisiana eighteen hours before the hurricane made landfall. Edith later struck land in the middle portion of the warning area.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{in tandem}} with larger Serb and Czech {{national}} units, Romanian prisoners on the Trans-Siberian Railway were involved in creating new armed formations. Their original goal was to show to the Entente that Romanians were still eager {{to fight against the}} Central Powers, but the Romanians also defended the line in skirmishes with the Bolshevik or anarchist cells. They resisted especially when the Bolshevik Russian government <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> surrender all weapons.|$|E

5|$|In 1885, Ramakrishna {{developed}} throat cancer, and {{was transferred}} to Calcutta and (later) to a garden house in Cossipore. Narendra and Ramakrishna's other disciples took care of him during his last days, and Narendra's spiritual education continued. At Cossipore, he experienced Nirvikalpa samadhi. Narendra and several other disciples received ochre robes from Ramakrishna, forming his first monastic order. He was taught that service to men was the most effective worship of God. Ramakrishna asked him {{to care for the}} other monastic disciples, and in turn <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> see Narendra as their leader. Ramakrishna died in the early-morning hours of 16 August 1886 in Cossipore.|$|E

The twins had slept through the commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing; Kate wrote that she was concerned the abductor might have given the children sedatives. According to the Polícia Judiciária files, Kate had <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> take samples, {{three months after the}} disappearance, but they had not done so. Control Risks took a sample from Kate too, to rebut allegations that she was on medication. No trace of drugs was found.|$|E

Wensley woke the ground floor tenants at number 100 and <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> fetch Gershon, claiming that she was needed by her sick husband. When Gershon appeared she was grabbed by the police and taken to the City of London police headquarters; the ground floor lodgers also evacuated.

5|$|Lars' {{inclusion}} in Naruto Shipuuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 was initially conceived of by CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama. In 2009, Matsuyama {{read in a}} Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine that Lars' third costume had been designed by Kishimoto and thought he {{should be included in}} Ultimate Ninja Storm 2. As a result, Matsuyama approached Tekken 6 producer Suguru Sasaki and his team and <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> include Lars in the game using Kishimoto's outfit. Once this was approved, the Tekken staff started assisting CyberConnect2 to adjust Lars' moves to fit the other characters in the Naruto game. When the work was concluded, Matsuyama was surprised at how well Lars fitted in with the game's cast.|$|E

Seventy members of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce pleaded with the protest organizers to stop the actions. The NAACP asked for sympathizers to picket in unity in 100 American cities. Nineteen rabbis from New York flew to Birmingham, equating silence about segregation to the atrocities of the Holocaust. Local rabbis disagreed and <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> go home.

5|$|Using Iraqi passports, Oan {{and three}} {{other members of the}} DRFLA arrived in London on 31 March 1980 and rented a flat in Earls Court. They claimed they had met by chance on the flight.

They soon found another flat, where they told their new landlord they were moving because they had been joined by other men and required larger accommodation. Over the following days, the group swelled, with up to a dozen men in the flat on one occasion.|$|E
5|$|Women in {{athletics}} often wear bikinis of similar size as those worn in beach volleyball. Amy Acuff, a US high-jumper, {{wore a black}} leather bikini instead of a track suit at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Runner Florence Griffith-Joyner mixed bikini bottoms with one-legged tights at the 1988 Summer Olympics, earning her more attention than her record breaking performance in the women's 200 meters event. In the 2007 South Pacific Games, the rules were adjusted to allow players to wear less revealing shorts and cropped sports tops instead of bikinis. At the West Asian Games in 2006, organizers banned bikini-bottoms for female athletes and <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> wear long shorts.|$|E

There he made a prepared speech {{saying that he was}} a private citizen wishing only to see their country, and that if any Indians wished to return to England with him, he would take them. He <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> join his party in a toast to the health of King George II, and to kneel in allegiance.

5|$|As {{demands for}} a {{parliament}} grew, Charles took {{the unusual step of}} summoning a great council of peers. By the time it met, on 24 September at York, Charles had resolved to follow the almost universal advice to call a parliament. After informing the peers that a parliament would convene in November, he <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> consider how he could acquire funds to maintain his army against the Scots in the meantime. They recommended making peace. A cessation of arms, although not a final settlement, was negotiated in the humiliating Treaty of Ripon, signed in October 1640. The treaty stated that the Scots would continue to occupy Northumberland and Durham and be paid £850 per day until peace was restored and the English Parliament recalled, which would be required to raise sufficient funds to pay the Scottish forces. Consequently, Charles summoned what later became known as the Long Parliament. Once again, Charles's supporters fared badly at the polls. Of the 493 members of the Commons returned in November, over 350 were opposed to the king.|$|E
5|$|As summer approached, Đujić's Chetniks {{captured}} Drvar {{from the}} Ustaše. By early summer, he and Chetnik commander Stevo Rađenović had contacted the Italians and <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> put {{a halt to}} the Ustaše mistreatment of Serbs, enable the return of Serb refugees, and repeal a decree that enabled the confiscation of Serb-owned property in the NDH. The Italians obliged in the hope that doing so would win the Chetniks over to collaboration and seriously weaken any future uprising in the area, which would have further disrupted rail traffic along the Split–Karlovac line. On 13 August, at a meeting in the village of Pađene, Đujić and several other Serb nationalists agreed to collaborate with the Italians. They secretly signed a pact of non-aggression with the Italian military, and in exchange, the Italians acquiesced to Đujić's 3,000 Chetniks operating in and around Knin. On 31 August, at a Drvar assembly, Đujić was given the task of stopping the Italian advance on the town. Immediately afterwards, he made an agreement with the Italians granting them free passage.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the English Civil War in 1642, {{fighting}} broke out around Portsmouth between the Royalist forces, led by Colonel George Goring, and Parliamentarians under the command of Colonel Richard Norton. Southsea Castle was held by the Royalist Captain Challoner, supported by a small garrison of eleven men and 14 guns, and Norton decided to attack the fortification with 400 infantry and two troops of cavalry. The assault took place at {{in the early hours of}} the morning on 5 September; the garrison had positioned their guns to point inland, so the attackers stormed the moat on the seaward side. They then demanded that the garrison surrender but Challoner, who had been drinking heavily with Goring the night before, refused to discuss this and <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> return later in the day. A fresh assault began and the garrison surrendered without loss of life. The capture of the castle meant left Portsmouth's position untenable and the town surrendered. A significant Parliamentarian garrison was then installed in the castle to keep it from being retaken.|$|E
