Singapore has until 14 June to submit to the ICJ its comprehensive and compelling rebuttal to Malaysia’s application.|$|E

25|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering and enjoying things {{is a prerequisite}} for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense {{to say that it was}} not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make <b>any</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.|$|E

Because of the railway's association with the West of England, the Public Relations Officer, John Elliot suggested {{that members of the}} N15class should be named after characters and places associated with the legend of King Arthur. When Maunsell was told of the decision to name the locomotives, he replied: [...] "Tell Sir Herbert [...] I have no objection, but I warn you, it won't make <b>any</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> the working of the engines". Walker was the General Manager of the Southern Railway, who had told Elliot that Maunsell's permission was required. The first G14 to be rebuilt, No.E453, was given the first name and christened King Arthur. The Urie locomotives (hitherto referred as N15s rather than King Arthurs) were also given names connected with Arthurian legend and were referred to as [...] "Urie Arthurs"; the Maunsell batches of N15s were nicknamed the [...] "Eastleigh" [...] and [...] "Scotch Arthurs".|$|E

In this study, we aim to assess the probability of sympatric speciation in mixed populations of nectarless Dactylorhiza incarnata varieties (incarnata, ochroleuca and cru-enta). We conducted morphological, phenological and ecological measurements in five populations in Hiiumaa, western Estonia. In most populations, {{we did not find}} <b>any</b> <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> reveal genetic divergence between the varieties. In one population, however, differences in shoot and flower traits were found. This population also differed at the commu-nity level from the other four study populations.

40|$|Exploring the {{experiences}} of early to mid-twentieth century British theatre-makers in Russia, this book imagines how these travellers interpreted Russian realism, symbolism, constructivism, agitprop, pageantry, dance or cinema. With some searching for {{an alternative to the}} corporate West End, some for experimental techniques and others still for methods that might politically inspire their audiences, did these journeys make <b>any</b> <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> their practice? And how did distinctly Russian techniques affect British theatre history? Migrating Modernist Performance seeks to answer these questions, reimagining {{the experiences}} and creative output of a range of, often under-researched, practitioners. What emerges is a dynamic collection of performances that bridge geographical, aesthetic, chronological and political divides...|$|R
