5|$|Home {{could easily}} have {{produced}} {{the sound of the}} <b>accordion</b> (concertina) by the use of a small harmonica concealed in his mouth. The up and down movement of the <b>accordion</b> {{could easily have}} been produced by catching the bottom of the <b>accordion</b> in a loop of black thread, or on a hook.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>accordion</b> experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes {{and another}} {{observer}} {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed {{on the top of the}} table, and the other inside the cage which held an <b>accordion</b> on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The <b>accordion</b> was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in the room was not stated, and the <b>accordion</b> was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the <b>accordion</b> played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Accordions</b> (including piano <b>accordions</b> and button <b>accordions)</b> {{typically}} have right-hand buttons or keys that play single notes (melody) and left hand buttons that play chords and bass notes.|$|R

5|$|Other {{researchers}} have suspected that a secret accomplice was involved. The magician Carlos María de Heredia {{claimed to have}} replicated the <b>accordion</b> feat of Home and suggested it was a trick performed by an accomplice playing a hidden <b>accordion.</b> Ruth Brandon considered {{the possibility of an}} accomplice playing a concertina, or Home playing a hidden music box. However, Brandon dismissed the accomplice hypothesis as unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Researcher Ronald Pearsall in {{his book}} The Table-Rappers (1972) {{suggested}} that a loop of catgut {{was attached to the}} <b>accordion</b> so Home could turn it round. Paul Kurtz wrote that other mediums had used a loop of catgut to obtain a similar effect with the <b>accordion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The magician John Nevil Maskelyne {{also criticized}} {{the design of}} the {{experiment}} for taking place under a table. The psychologist Millais Culpin wrote the experiment was not scientific and questioned why the experiment was done under the table instead of in a more convenient position on top of it. Before the <b>accordion</b> experiment with Crookes, Home had performed the <b>accordion</b> feat for over fifteen years under various conditions but always under his control. It was reported by sitters and Crookes that Home's <b>accordion</b> played only two pieces, Home Sweet Home and The Last Rose of Summer. Both contain only one-octave.|$|E

5|$|The two-octave {{diatonic}} <b>accordion</b> (gorodo), popular across Madagascar, {{is believed}} to have been imported by French colonists after 1896. In the 20th century, the instrument was commonly performed during tromba spirit possession ceremonies in a style called renitra. In the 1970s, the renitra was incorporated for the performance of electrified salegy music. This <b>accordion</b> style was also integrated into the performance of tsapika, while also inspiring the style used by the guitarists in these bands. Although today the sound of the <b>accordion</b> is most often replicated by a synthesizer in salegy or tsapika bands due to the expense and rarity of the instrument, accordions continue to hold a privileged place in the performance of tromba ceremonial music. Artists like half-brothers Lego and Rossy have gained success as <b>accordion</b> players. Régis Gizavo brought the contemporary style of renitra to the world music scene, winning several international awards for his <b>accordion</b> performance.|$|E

50|$|Other {{instruments}} {{that might be}} in a Boeremusiek band would be piano <b>accordions,</b> button harmonicas, <b>accordions,</b> pianos, harmoniums and the guitar, and sometimes, a cello or bass guitar may be seen.|$|R
50|$|DBAs {{have two}} main {{advantages}} {{when compared with}} chromatic <b>accordions</b> such as piano <b>accordions</b> and chromatic button accordions: 1) smaller size and lighter weight, 2) and the rhythmic effects inherent in the single ("push-pull") action.|$|R
50|$|Miller {{is the son}} of {{sharecropper}} Abraham Miller and Algena Leger. He and his son Mike {{published a}} book in 1988 called 'You Can Play Cajun Accordion: Designed For Beginners.' Miller didn't begin to build <b>accordions</b> until he was 52 years old in 1988. Before he worked in primary and secondary education for 22 years. He {{was also one of the}} founders of the Cajun French Music Association. Miller retired from building <b>accordions</b> full-time in 2006. His grandson Jay continues to build <b>accordions</b> under the brand 'Bon Cajun.' Before retiring, he'd built around 85 <b>accordions</b> a year and repaired around 200 in the same time.|$|R
5|$|The {{claim that}} the <b>accordion</b> feat was {{performed}} by Home using a small harmonica was originally suggested by J. M. Robertson in 1891. The psychical researcher Eric Dingwall who catalogued Home's collection on its arrival at the SPR did not record {{the presence of the}} mouth organs, and Lamont speculates that it is unlikely Dingwall would have missed these or not made them public. The <b>accordion</b> in the SPR collection is not the actual one Home used. They display a duplicate.|$|E
5|$|Bueno's {{band was}} a typical cuarteto band, {{composed}} of fourteen musicians. Percussion predominated, with a main drummer and additional timbales, complemented by an <b>accordion</b> and an electric organ. The vocal part of the band featured a male quartet as a chorus.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, William Benjamin Carpenter wrote a {{critical}} {{evaluation of the}} Crookes experiments with Home in the Quarterly Review. Carpenter wrote that although Crookes, his assistant and Sergeant Cox claimed to have observed the <b>accordion</b> float in the cage; Dr. Huggins did not testify to this, and no information was given to whether the keys and bellows were seen to move. According to Carpenter no solid explanation could be given until the experiment is repeated, however, he suggested that the <b>accordion</b> feat that Home performed {{may have been a}} conjuring trick achieved with one hand. Carpenter concluded that Crookes should repeat the experiment in open daylight without the cage in the presence of other witnesses.|$|E
50|$|Many {{different}} <b>accordions</b> {{were developed}} in Europe throughout the 19th century, and exported worldwide. <b>Accordions</b> were brought to Acadiana in the 1890s and became popular by the early 1900s (decade), eventually becoming a staple of Cajun music.|$|R
5000|$|In Ireland, melodeon (mileoidean or an bosca) is {{reserved}} for instruments with a single row of melody buttons (a [...] "one-row" [...] instrument), while instruments {{with two or three}} rows are called button <b>accordions</b> (often simply <b>accordions).</b>|$|R
50|$|Between 1953 and 1968, {{the yearly}} {{production}} of button <b>accordions</b> (garmons and bayans) in the Soviet Union ranged between 597,307 and 921,674 instruments, while the yearly production of piano <b>accordions</b> ranged between 7,124 and 120,313 instruments (averaging around 50,000).|$|R
5|$|Jing Ping {{is a kind}} of {{folk music}} {{originated}} on the slave plantations of Dominica, also known colloquially as an <b>accordion</b> band. In Dominican folk music, jing ping bands accompany a circle dance called the flirtation, as well as the Dominican quadrille.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} tuning {{utilized}} {{is the key}} of C, although the key of D is also relatively common. [...] Some rarer <b>accordions</b> are constructed to in the key of B flat. Cajun <b>accordions</b> are traditionally tuned to a Just Intonation.|$|R
50|$|A reed rank inside <b>accordions</b> {{refers to}} a single full set of the reeds that are the means to achieve the instrument's sound range. These reed ranks {{are located in the}} reed chamber. Most <b>accordions</b> to this date {{typically}} have between 2 and 4 reed ranks on the treble side and between 3 and 5 reed ranks on the bass side. These can usually be selected individually or combined in various ways to provide a range of different timbres, by use of register switches arranged by register from high to low. More of the top-line expensive <b>accordions</b> may contain 5 or 6 reed blocks on the treble side for different tunings, typically found in <b>accordions</b> which stress musette sounds.|$|R
