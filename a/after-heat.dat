The high thermal {{conductivity}} of Aluminum nitride, coupled with its high electrical resistivity and nontoxic nature, {{makes it a}} very promising material for electronic substrate. In this study, microstructural characterization on the {{thermal conductivity}} of AlN ceramics was investigated. An AlN ceramic was prepared with a dopant Y 2 O 3 under a reducing nitrogen atmosphere with carbon. In order to obtain high thermal conductivity, cooling rate control and <b>after-heat</b> treatment was carried out. Morphology of the second phase was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM studies showed that the microstructural change caused by <b>after-heat</b> treatment have {{a major influence on}} the thermal conductivity...|$|E

Experiments of the integral beta and gamma measurements were reviewed here. Various experimental methods are outlined and discussed. The results of the experiments were noted and compared with the ANS curves. Also, the experimental errors involved were investigated; the errors were attributed to specific techniques and procedures associated with each experiment.

The power deposited as heat by the radioactive nuclides (the so-called <b>after-heat)</b> can considerably increase the target temperature after ceasing operation, if no active cooling is provided. An estimate of the induced radioactivity and <b>after-heat</b> was performed with the FLUKA Monte Carlo code.

40|$|In {{consideration}} of economic interests {{as well as}} ecological aspects secured, world-wide power supply belongs to the largest challenges of our time. Regarding the CO 2 global discussed problem (greenhouse effect), nuclear energy is continuously playing a major decisive role {{in the range of}} electrical energy production in future. A set of solutions is suggested and examined globally concerning security improvements of nuclear energy supply. Aim is to prevent the release of fission products under any circumstance. Furthermore, it is essential to limit consequences to the plant itself in case of hypothetical incidents. Exemplified at the European Pressurized Water Reactor (EPR) the requirements of controlling core melt-accidents are pointed out and a solution for melt retention (core- catcher) is described. Process knowledge of postulated core melt accidents is enhanced by understanding the behaviour of structural materials in combination with a core melt. Therefore, suitable measures to ensure the integrity of reactor containment can be developed. Explicitly the requirements of protective and sacrificial materials are identified. The stability of various refractory materials all based on zirconia (ZrO 2) in contact with metallic phase of core melt has been investigated in large-scale experiments. These tests were characterised by high temperature metallic melts with melt temperature of about 2000 °C and melt masses of up to 6 mg. They proved that zirconia could fulfil the task of a protective material against the metallic melt impact. Erosion effects have not been detected. The early sintering of the zirconia ramming mass led to high surface stability which could effectively prevent infiltration of the metallic melt into the zirconia ramming mass. Anyhow, loose ramming mass was still found below the stable layer. This is advantageous with respect to the prevention of crack formation due to thermal loads. Experiments investigating the behaviour of zirconia protective materials against high-temperature metallic melts showed a good long-term stability for the investigated zirconia compounds. Furthermore the MCCI (Molten Corium Concrete Interaction) behaviour of various structural and sacrificial concretes was characterised in experiments with high-temperature metal melts. The experimental goals are related to investigations of interactions between concrete and core melt in two-dimensional geometries, particularly in terms of ratio of horizontal and vertical erosion. In three transient experiments (without <b>after-heating</b> of melt) with high-temperature-melts six different types of concretes were investigated. These six tests were carried out with melt masses by 1 mg each and temperatures of about 2. 000 °C. In all attempts the rate of melt progression in the wall increases super proportional in comparison to the erosion at the bottom. The sacrificial concrete rich in iron oxide showed the highest erosion. The sacrificial concretes with portland cement showed a higher erosion than the sacrificial concretes with alumina cement. Due to largest integral erosion, iron oxide-rich concrete appears as sacrificial concrete most qualified. The results can be used both for the enhancement and validation of appropriate computer models and beyond that to meet a selection of suitable accident controlling measures. On the one hand the represented results are usable for answering questions to existing plants, on the other hand likewise also for future plants...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project {{was to develop a}} new method of heating of pig houses and more specifically the swine nurseries with the use of Solar Heating Systems. In the proposed method a Test Shell with Solar Mass Wall, is used to service the heating needs of nursing sows while for the nurslings was created a special flooring (pad) with embodied heated pipes, throw a system of solar collectors and heating storage tank. The structural elements of this system are a solar mass wall, a specially designed heated flooring (shelter), a solar absorber, a solar collector, a heating storage tank and a heating supply tank. These elements are combined together using appropriate fluid circuits and digital controllers. The system provides a suitable environment for the nursling’ shelter {{as well as to the}} nursing sow through the solar mass wall. The system is composed of two main circuits. The first one includes the solar units and the storage (heating) tank (Circuit A) and the second one contains the supply (<b>after-heating)</b> tank and the pad (Circuit B). The first days are the most critical in a piglet’s life. Up to 80 % of piglet losses occur in the first 3 days of life and the majority of deaths are attributed to crushing. To reduce piglet losses by crushing by the sow the nest area must be warm. However, because of economic and hygienic disadvantages, straw is becoming less and the modern practice is to use either electric or gas infrared heaters, or underground heaters with solid plates. In the first 10 days of life, the young piglets require temperatures of at least 32 - 36 OC in the nest. Infrared heaters with IR-emitter have the highest temperature on the surface directly under the centre of the radiator, and outwards from the centre the temperature drops. An underground heater (warm water heat source) has a homogeneous surface temperature, therefore every piglet of the litter gets the same temperature in the nest area. The flooring in farrowing pens must satisfy a wide variety of criteria. The floor must be durable and easily to clean. The aim of this investigation was to test a new heating system for young piglets and to compare it with the conventional electric heating lamps and the warm water bed. This system incorporates all the benefits of the floor heating systems. In addition the controlled distribution of the solar energy, not only reduces the consumption of the electric energy to the 20 - 25 % of the consumption of the conventional system with infrared lamps, but also provides the specific thermal environment for the weaned piglets as well as to the nursing sown. Using a control system, the fluid temperature is kept close to the desired optimal temperature, in contrast with the conventional halogen and incandescent infrared lamps where the heating is regulated by the distance between the lamp and the piglets. Furthermore, the optimal temperature is regulated to decrease one degree centigrade per day and this means that the electric consumption is decreased as well. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} program NAKOSTA (NAtural COnvection in the STAtionary Condition) was made which enables {{to calculate the}} heat transport by natural convection with a given course of surface temperature along a. defined, closed circuit. This circuit consists in essential of a heat-supplying and a heat-removing component. These two main components are divided into some axial zones {{in order to determine}} most exactly the local coolant-temperatures with a given mass flow under consideration of the corresponding heat transfer coefficient or overall heat transfer coefficient. At the same time, the local coefficients of pressure loss and thereby the local factors of pressure loss are calculated. An iteration procedure determines buoyancy and pressure loss along the circuit with the corresponding mass flow, and the removable heat amount per unit time. Some examples show different cooler arrangements and gases (helium, air, C 0 $_{ 2 }$) and their effect to removable heat amounts atvarious system pressures. This shows that with C 0 $_{ 2 }$ at system pressures between 10 and 20 bar and with the application of an optimized finned cooler an <b>after-heat</b> amount of more than 1 % of the thermal core power by normal operation can be removed. The same amount of <b>after-heat</b> could also be removed under these pressures with a tube cooler by using helium. The application of different fuel element types in the core, however, did not show a significant difference in <b>after-heat</b> removal...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{served to}} {{investigate}} {{the behavior of the}} pressure vessel in serious reactor accidents. To this end, a reference case for a conservative accident scenario was initially defined then modeled with the FEM software ANSYS. Calculations done with this software were used to analyze the behavior of the pressure vessel in the reference case up to the point that thermal failure would occur. Due to the high uncertainty involved in the complex accident sequence, several analyses beyond reference case calculation were conducted {{in order to determine the}} impact of changes in vital parameters up until the vessel's thermal failure. Calculation results show that the thickness of the corium crust – which develops in the early stages of the accident – has significant impact on the time to failure. Other vital parameters are the amount of <b>after-heat</b> power and the emission of heat from the pressure vessel's outer wall (thus, the cooling conditions at the outer wall). Based on these results, several ideas were generated to extend the time to failure and analyzed independently from each other: reducing the amount of <b>after-heat</b> power, optimizing cooling conditions at the pressure vessel's outer wall (cooling with water, cooling with lead), and inserting a protective ZrO 2 layer that would fulfill a similar function as the corium crust. Results from these analyses show that implementing these measures can extend the time up until failure significantly. However, vessel failure – thus the penetration of corium into the containment – probably cannot be prevented completely. In this work, the technical definition and design of the improvement measures were not investigated in detail. Nor were any implications for the plant of implementing these measures (e. g., implementation cost, impact on normal mode). In addition, mechanical vessel failure mechanisms could not be considered. Therefore, the implementation of the suggested improvement measures requires further detailed investigations. In parallel and in addition to further calculations, experiments need to be carried out in order to validate simulation results...|$|E

40|$|DEMO is {{the name}} for the first stage {{prototype}} fusion reactor {{considered to be the}} next step after ITER towards realizing fusion. For the realization of fusion energy especially, materials questions pose a significant challenge already today. Heat, particle and neutron loads are a significant problem to material lifetime when extrapolating to DEMO. For many of the issues faced, advanced materials solutions are under discussion or already under development. In particular, components such as the first wall and the divertor of the reactor can benefit from introducing new approaches such as composites or new alloys into the discussion. Cracking, oxidation as well as fuel management are driving issues when deciding for new materials. Here W_f/W composites as well as strengthened CuCrZr components together with oxidation resilient tungsten alloys allow the step towards a fusion reactor. In addition, neutron induced effects such as transmutation, embrittlement and <b>after-heat</b> and activation are essential. Therefore, when designing a component an approach taking into account all aspects is required...|$|E
40|$|While the {{potential}} hazards posed by large particle accelerator driven spallation targets are greatly reduced {{in comparison to}} nuclear reactors capable of similar neutron production levels, they are significant, and require a safety-by-design approach to ensure there is little likelihood of accidental releases of target materials. Most postulated accident scenarios evolve very slowly, given the modest <b>after-heat</b> levels in spallation targets, and modest backup heat removal systems can prevent target damage. Similarly, events where problems develop with the accelerated particle beams are easily detected and can be quickly terminated. This leaves an interesting class of postulated accidents, where problems are postulated to develop in the target cooling system {{but there is a}} failure to recognize the problem and shut down the accelerator. Safety systems designed to detect such problems are likely to be reliable, but given {{the potential}} for serious target damage, there is incentive to further reduce the likelihood of this class of events. Options to do so are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Independent {{fission product}} yields are primary input nuclear {{data in the}} {{evaluation}} of nuclear reactor <b>after-heat</b> when using a nuclide-decay summation method. The error in yield values {{is one of the major}} causes of uncertainty of this calculation. Since only a small fraction of the fission product yields has been measured directly, the adoption of model-predicted unknown yields is inevitable. The uncertainty involved is usually quite large. This dissertation presents a systematic approach to correlating the relevant experimental and calculated ²³⁵U thermal fission data with other nuclear data, so that with application constraints from exact physical laws, a consistent set of primary fission fragment yields can be generated. These are for use in improving the precision of <b>after-heat</b> calculations by constraining yield errors and thereby reducing the uncertainties caused by them. Fission fragment kinetic energy data and nuclear mass table data are used to calculate the total excitation energy of a fragment pair. This energy is partitioned between light and heavy fragments assuming equal temperature of the fragments at the time of scission. The prompt de-excitation of the primary fission fragment via neutron and gamma ray emissions is simulated by nuclear evaporation processes. A FORTRAN IV Monte Carlo Code called EVAPOR was developed for this purpose. Neutron yields and emission probabilities for various numbers of neutrons from over 1, 000 possible fission fragments were generated by EVAPOR. The major uncertainties of the emission probabilities calculated by EVAPOR can be simulated by lumping them together as though they were the result of uncertainties in the mean excitation energy of a fission fragment. A sensitivity study of the effect of this uncertainty thus permits an a priori estimate of emission probability error. The resulting emission probabilities and their errors can then be used as an input for inference of primary fragment yields. This inference, a form of probabilistic data unfolding, has been explored for a sample case. Results to date have shown that a consistent set of primary (before neutron emission) and secondary (after neutron emission) yields can be generated using combined data for light and heavy fragments of complementary charge number. However, there are significant discrepancies between the secondary yields obtained by this process and those used as input to it, which stem from the ENDF/B-IV evaluation. The sources of these discrepancies must still be explored...|$|E
40|$|Considerations for {{the future}} world economy require a {{substantial}} contribution of nuclear energy. However, a new quality of safety is necessary {{for the future}} world-wide increased use of nuclear energy, a catastrophe-free nuclear technology is demanded. Catastrophe-free means, that even in case of extreme accidents there is no release of unallowable amounts of radioactive fission products from the reactor plant, the consequences of the accident must be restricted to the area of the reactor plant itself. To reach this objective it can be tried either by reactor concepts with guaranteed retention and control of the consequences of a molten core inside the reactor containment or by reactor concepts, in which the core melt accident is excluded by natural laws in which the radioactive fission products stay inside the fuel elements in all accidents. This report treats conditions which are stringent in the latter case. The following 6 conditions must be fulfilled in all cases of accidents: selfacting limitation of the nuclear power production and of the fuel temperature, selfacting <b>after-heat</b> removal from the core and the power plant, selfacting receipt of the barriers fuel elements, reactor pressure vessel and reactor containment, independency of the fission product barriers from each other. These are final conditions for the receipt of the integrity of the fuel elements and the retention of the radioactive fission products in the fuel elements. The refered requirements to realize catastrophe-free nuclear technology have to be proved extensively for new reactor concepts. (orig.)

40|$|Today {{spot welding}} {{is still the}} most applied joining {{technique}} in the automotive industry. But new developed materials require the adaption and enhancement of this technology for a robust joining process. Investigations were focused on weld-ability of high- and ultra high strength steels like HT 700 T (TRIP steel) or 22 MnB 5 (press hardening steel) by using a servo-mechanical drive for electrode force as well as power control instead of conventional welding current controller. The results of the experiments showed that the TRIP-steel as well as the press hardening steel can be safely welded with an electrode force of more than 5 kN and an welding current of about 8 kA. Best results were achieved with a process control using multiple current impulses. By using an <b>after-heat</b> impulse hardness of spot welds is decreased and the failure mode of the specimen during the chisel test could be improved. The course of hardness across the spot weld lens as well as inside of the base material is already on a high level but drops significantly steep inside of heat affected zone (HAZ). The advantage of the servo mechanical electrode drive is the backlash-free threaded spindle which leads to an increase of electrode force because of the thermal expansion of material during heating up to melting temperature. This effect improves the weldability of 22 MnB 5 and leads to an increase in tool-life time of the spot welding electrodes. The use of process control with controlled welding power in conjunction with a multi impulse process have favorable effects on the results of the tensile tests and ensures a robust welding process. It could be proven that, if the appropriate welding parameters are chosen, joining of HT 700 T as well as 22 MnB 5 by resistance spot welding is possible where the welded connections fulfill the requirements of quality in respect of lens diameter, connection strength and failure mode...|$|E
40|$|Railway {{crossings}} {{belong to}} the most exposed components of a track structure. Operational load presents very complicated complex of adhesive, abrasive, and mainly contact-fatigue affect, which leads to preferential wear and tear primarily in the point and stock rail area depending on many external factors (such as crosswise and lengthwise slip, actual geometry relation in contact with a real worn wheel profile and the like) in the final result. The possibility of continuous reprofiling of the worn segments is an essential requirement on the material applied. The selection of material analyses results presented herein refer to the surfacing technology proposal of progressive bainitic steel for railway crossings casting. This material, industrial termed as Lo 17 MnCrNiMo, is intended for the most load-carrying segments particularly. Its chemical composition together with heat treating leads to the comparison with the original alternative (already applied Lo 8 CrNiMo) to modification of phases represented and later-on higher yield value mechanical parameters, fracture and notch toughness. Development holder of this material and as well the surfacing technology is DT - Výhybkárna a strojírna, a. s, Prostějov company. Surfacing technology solved herein came from experimental verification of some filler material alternatives, while the common background was following: • overlay quality associated with original characteristics of the base material; • demanded quality of join without a degradation of overlays characteristics; • all without a need of pre-heat and <b>after-heat</b> of created overlays. This technology is so attractive primarily because of reducing the problematic heat-cycle requirements {{that are to be}} obeyed. From the results – the crucial zone of transition follows from line of joint to the surface travel area. In this zone direct contact between base material and surfacing metal – no interlayer. This situation present a direct source of weld joint harm in interpreted combinations, simultaneously the absence of interlayer can cause higher inner press on weld boundaries. The positive influence of repeated heating of following layers surfacing on HAZ, {{as well as on the}} inner shape (grain) of surfacing metal, does not take effect. Manual impact load testing results in austenitic material of Cr/Mn type, which is manually able to harden above its original hardness of base material – without a phase transformation. Bainitic surfacing metal of Cr/Ni/Mo type does not yield to dynamic hardening under load. Large amount of dispersion of hardening was identified in area under the surfacing lengthwise the created weld deposits. In coincidence with this “sensitivity” to implementation it is proper to think of automatic surfacing appliance. Automation brings the advantage of stabilized process with and thus also the quality performance, simultaneously there is the possibility for layer preservation by flux and the positive impact regime of surfacing layers cooling. On principal it is necessary to lean the development of contact-fatigue load, where outstanding impact rate of load occurs in addition, against two basic moments: 1. The increase of lifetime in a given regime of load requires an optimal drift into the range of high cycle fatigue, where the influence of fore fatigue process stadium is principally real, which is possible to put together with increase of yield point from the characteristic material impress point of view. 2. Practically running processes of cumulative microscopic deformation (ratcheting) pose claims on the development conditions of surface layers plasticity. That together with anaclastic behaviour of a material influences the circumstances of already initiated damage, i. e. safety in regard of a dynamic load.

40|$|Under {{the auspices}} of the CEA Cadarache/ANL-US I-NERI project a {{comprehensive}} investigation has been made of improvements to the Gen-IV GFR safety case over that of the GCFR safety case twenty five years ago. In particular, it has been concluded and agreed upon [1] that the GFR safety approach for the passive removal of decay heat in a protected depressurization accident with total loss of electric power needs to be different from that taken for the HTRs. The HTR conduction cooldown to the vessel wall boundary mode for an economically attractive core is not feasible {{in the case of the}} GFR because the high power densities (100 kW/ 1 compared to 5 kW/ 1 for pebble bed thermal reactor) require decay heat fluxes well beyond those achievable by the heat conduction and radiation heat transfer mode. A set of alternative novel design options has been evaluated for potential passive safety mechanisms unique to the GFR. In summary, from a technological risk viewpoint and R&D planning, the option which has been identified is the block/plate-based or a pin-based reactor with a secondary guard containment/vessel around the primary vessel to maintain the primary system pressure at a high enough level which would allow primary system natural convection removal of core generated decay heat to be effective. Dedicated emergency decay heat exchangers would have to be connected in a 'failure-proof' configuration to the primary system and have natural convection capability all the way to the ultimate heat sink. What has been collaboratively agreed upon and selected for further development is the natural convection option with a block/plate or pin type derated core and a hybrid passive/active approach. [2] The guard containment will be utilized but it will be sized for an LWR containment range backup pressure (5 - 7 bars) with an initial pressure of 1 bar. The assessment has shown that a significantly higher back pressure is required for total natural convection driven removal of significant decay heat levels at GFR target power densities. The lower back-up pressure, plus whatever natural convection is available at this pressure, will be utilized to significantly reduce the blower power of the active DHR system sized to remove 2 - 3 % decay power. The objective is to be able to have such low power requirements so that power supplies such as batteries without the need for startup, can be utilized. This lower back-up pressure should be sufficient to support natural convection removal of 0. 5 % decay heat which occurs at {approx} 24 hrs. So there should be no more need for active systems/power supply after the initial period of one day. Furthermore, since there will be a decay of the <b>after-heat</b> from 2 - 3 % to 0. 5 % in this time period, credit should be taken in probability space for loss of active systems during the 24 hours. The safety approach will then be a probabilistic one. In the future discussions with the regulatory authorities the approach which will then be taken is that this class of decay heat removal accidents should be treated in combination with the PRA rather than solely through deterministic calculations. Work is now ongoing in the U. S. -France I-NERI GFR project to further evaluate this hybrid passive/active approach to heat removal for depressurized decay heat accidents. The objective of the analysis documented in this report is to provide information on local and global temperature, pressure and flow distributions in the guard containment, during steady state, and reactor vessel depressurization conditions due to a small break in the reactor vessel bottom control rod drive system. This is for the 2400 MWt plant option. The results should lead to improved guard containment designs and enhanced margin for safety criteria...|$|E
