5|$|From the 1950s onwards, {{stories about}} Brown were often {{included}} in local {{histories of the}} southeast of South Australia. Examples include Elma Smith's History of Kingston published in 1950, and Kingston Flashback written by local historian Verne McLaren and published in 1970. In Smith's version, the original crime was not discussed, and {{the focus was on}} the horse ride to Adelaide, and McLaren's account split the legend into two, one about a poisoning by Brown, and another in which Brown and an accomplice cornered Aboriginal people in the Papineau caves, smoked them out and shot them. The second of McLaren's stories ended with Brown's famous ride to Adelaide to report to the police. Another account was included in Barry Durman's A History of the Baker's Range Settlement, published in 1978. Durman reproduced <b>a</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>article</b> about the investigation into Brown's involvement in the murders, passed over the manner by which the murders were carried out and stated that the case was not proven, and then told of a wonderful feat of horsemanship by Brown.|$|E
