25|$|The {{melatonin}} receptors <b>are</b> <b>G</b> protein-coupled receptors and {{are expressed}} in various tissues of the body. There are two subtypes of the receptor in humans, melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) and melatonin receptor 2 (MT2). Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, on market or in clinical trials, all bind to and activate both receptor types. The binding of the agonists to the receptors has been investigated since 1986, yet is still not fully understood. When melatonin receptor agonists bind to and activate their receptors it causes numerous physiological processes.|$|E
25|$|Tissue factor also binds {{to factor}} VII in the blood, which initiates the {{extrinsic}} coagulation cascade to increase thrombin production. Thrombin {{is a potent}} platelet activator, acting through Gq and G12. These <b>are</b> <b>G</b> protein coupled receptors and they turn on calcium mediated signaling pathways within the platelet, overcoming the baseline calcium efflux. Families of three G proteins (Gq, Gi, G12) operate together for full activation. Thrombin also promotes secondary fibrin-reinforcement of the platelet plug. Platelet activation in turn degranulates and releases factor V and fibrinogen, potentiating the coagulation cascade. So in reality the process of platelet plugging and coagulation are occurring simultaneously rather than sequentially, with each inducing the other to form the final clot.|$|E
25|$|In humans {{there are}} two subtypes of {{melatonin}} receptors targeted by melatonin agonists, MT1 and MT2. They <b>are</b> <b>G</b> protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body, together or singly. MT1 receptors are expressed in many regions of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS): suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. MT1 is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, mammary gland, coronary circulation and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT2 receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes.|$|E

2500|$|... 5-HT2 receptors <b>are</b> <b>G</b> protein-coupled receptors {{that can}} {{regulate}} cellular signaling {{in the absence}} of a ligand. This can be explained by a two-state model (Figure 2) where the receptor is in equilibrium between two states, an active state (R*) and an inactive state (R). Basal effector activity is defined, in part, by the absolute level of (R*), which will increase along with increasing receptor density. Ligands that preferentially bind to and stabilize the R state are termed inverse agonists and reduce the effector activity. Agonists preferentially bind to and stabilize the R* state, thereby increasing effector activity. Neutral antagonists show equal affinity for both conformations and do not alter the equilibrium between the two states, however they occupy the receptor and can block the effect of both agonists and inverse agonists. and 5-HT2C receptors |year=2005 |last1=Berg |first1=Kelly A. |last2=Harvey |first2=John A. |last3=Spampinato |first3=Umberto |last4=Clarke |first4=William P. |journal=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences |volume=26 |issue=12 |pages=625–30 |pmid=16269190}} Receptor Systems |journal=Molecular Pharmacology |pmid=10220565 |url=http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long=10220565 |year=1999 |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=863–72}} ...|$|E
2500|$|Amber {{specimen}} JZC Bu116 has {{a larger}} number of workers than JZC Bu1814, with a total of twelve workers belonging to two genera. [...] Eleven of the ants <b>are</b> <b>G.</b> spiralis and the remaining worker is from the haidomyrmecine species Haidomyrmex zigrasi. [...] The amber is broken into two portions and has been polished. [...] The original amber piece that the specimen was from was likely larger, and the twelve ants are only a minimum number for what the grouping was. [...] A large number of other arthropods are preserved in the amber with the ants, including several other hymenopteran families, a dermapteran, an orthopteran, seven dipterans, two arachnids, a myriapod, and a large blattodean. [...] The blattodean is central to four of the ants, three G. sprialis and the H. zigrasi worker, suggesting the roach may have been either a potential food source, or one being actively foraged on. [...] Due to a lack of orientation to the roach however, the possibility that the other eight G. sprialis were recruited to the prey blattodean is not clear.|$|E

2500|$|The 5-HT2C receptors <b>are</b> <b>G</b> protein–coupled receptors {{that are}} coupled to {{phospholipase}} C (PLC) via Gαq, phospholipase A2 (PLA2), and possibly Gα13. PLC metabolizes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), which regulates cellular Ca2+ flux by binding to IP3 receptors, thereby inducing {{the release of}} Ca2+. In addition, the activation of PLA2 also results in recruitment of a RhoA/PLD pathway through RhoA, an enzyme that regulates {{a wide spectrum of}} cellular functions through PLD (phospholipase D) target protein. The 5-HT2C receptors can also stimulate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway which is activated by neurotrophins and other neuroactive chemicals. Production of these chemicals effects neuronal differentiation, survival, regeneration, and structural and functional plasticity. Early studies of the ERK pathway showed that mood stabilizers for the treatment of manic-depressive illness stimulated the pathway. This led to the understanding that stimulation of the 5-HT2C receptors could regulate manic-depressive conditions {{in a manner similar to}} mood stabilizers.
