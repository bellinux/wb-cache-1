5|$|After {{purchasing}} a drum set and acquiring a piano from Joey's mother, Jimmy secures {{the remainder of}} the band's musical equipment from Duffy, a black market dealer. The band rehearses on the second floor above a snooker hall, and after much practice, they convince a local church community centre to give them <b>a</b> <b>gig,</b> under the pretence of it being an anti-heroin campaign. Jimmy then hires Mickah Wallace, a hot-tempered bouncer, to act as the band's security. The band draws a good crowd, but after Deco inadvertently hits Derek with his microphone stand, the amplifiers explode, resulting in a power outage.|$|E

The group was hired for <b>a</b> <b>gig</b> in December 1920, but a complaint was lodged with the American Federation of Musicians, Local 67, that the boys did not have union cards.

5|$|During <b>a</b> <b>gig</b> with a {{stand-in}} drummer in late April at the Oldfield, {{the band}} first met Keith Moon. Moon {{grew up in}} Wembley, and had been drumming in bands since 1961.

The Beachcombers auditioned Sandom, but were unimpressed and did not ask him to join.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{release was}} titled Live in Japan and {{featured}} a unique sleeve design, with an overhead stage {{shot of the}} band, a selection of photographs from <b>a</b> <b>gig</b> at the Rainbow Theatre in London, and an insert with lyrics and a hand-written message from each band member. The first pressing came with a 35mm film negative with photos of the band which buyers could develop into their own prints. The sleeve notes claimed that the recording only contained the Tokyo gig, though {{in fact it was}} musically identical to the version released {{in the rest of the}} world. Phil Collen, later to play in Def Leppard, was in the audience for the Rainbow gig as captured on the sleeve.|$|E
5|$|The Super Furry Animals played {{numerous}} festivals in Great Britain {{prior to}} Love Kraft's release including Scotland's T in the Park, Oxegen, the Secret Garden Party in Cambridge and the V Festival, warming up for these dates {{with a small}} show at Barry Memorial Hall on 22 July 2005. <b>A</b> <b>gig</b> at Somerset House in London on 8 July 2005 went ahead despite coming just {{one day after the}} 7/7 bombings caused Queens of the Stone Age to cancel their show at the venue.|$|E
5|$|To {{support the}} record the band staged an eventful world tour. While touring in Barcelona in 2000, Oasis {{were forced to}} cancel <b>a</b> <b>gig</b> when an attack of {{tendinitis}} caused Alan White's arm to seize up, and the band spent the night drinking instead. After a row between the two brothers, Noel declared he was quitting touring overseas altogether, and Oasis were supposed to finish the tour without him. Noel eventually returned for the Irish and British legs of the tour, which included two major shows at Wembley Stadium. A live album of the first show, called Familiar to Millions, was released in late 2000 to mixed reviews.|$|E

5|$|At {{one point}} at Morley Memorial Junior School he was taught by Roger Waters' mother, Mary. Later, in 1957, he {{attended}} Cambridgeshire High School for Boys (with Waters). His father {{died of cancer}} on 11 December 1961, {{less than a month}} before Barrett's 16th birthday. Also on this day, Barrett had left the entry in his diary blank. By this time, his brothers and sisters had left home and his mother decided to rent out rooms to lodgers. Eager to help her son recover from his grief, Barrett's mother encouraged the band in which he played, Geoff Mott and The Mottoes, a band which Barrett formed, to perform in their front room. Roger Waters and Syd Barrett were childhood friends, and Waters often visited such gigs. At one point, Waters even organised <b>a</b> <b>gig,</b> a CND benefit at Friends Meeting House on 11 March 1962, but shortly afterwards Geoff Mott joined the Boston Crabs, and the Mottoes broke up.|$|E
5|$|King and Jenner befriended American {{expatriate}} Joe Boyd, the {{promoter of}} the UFO Club, {{who was making}} {{a name for himself}} as one of the more important entrepreneurs on the British music scene. The newly hired booking agent, Bryan Morrison, and Boyd had proposed sending in better quality recordings. From Morrison's agency the band played <b>a</b> <b>gig</b> outside London for the first time. In November, the band performed the first (of many) strangely named concerts: Philadelic Music for Simian Hominids, a multimedia event arranged by the group's former landlord, Mike Leonard, at Hornsey College of Art. They performed at the Free School for the following two weeks, before performing at the Psychodelphia Versus Ian Smith event at the Roundhouse in December, arranged by the Majority Rule for Rhodesia Campaign, and an Oxfam benefit at the Albert Hall (the band's biggest venue up to this point).|$|E
5|$|Oasis' debut album, Definitely Maybe (1994), {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the band's rise to fame as part of the Britpop movement. Oasis' second album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995), reached the top of the album charts in many countries and their third studio album, Be Here Now (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. Britpop eventually declined in popularity and Oasis' next two albums failed to revive it. However, the band's final two albums, Don't Believe the Truth (2005) and Dig Out Your Soul (2008), were hailed as its best efforts in over a decade and found renewed success. On 28 August 2009, following an altercation with Liam prior to <b>a</b> <b>gig</b> in Paris, Noel Gallagher announced his departure from Oasis and on 23 October 2009, he confirmed he would embark on a solo career. Gallagher would go on to form Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{sporting}} uses, the Emirates {{has been}} used as a music venue which increases the maximum capacity to 72,000.
