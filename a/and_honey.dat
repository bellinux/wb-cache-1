5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that giant North American fruits of plants such as the Osage-orange, Kentucky coffeetree <b>and</b> <b>honey</b> locust evolved in tandem with now-extinct American megafauna such as mammoths and other proboscideans, {{since there are no}} extant endemic herbivores able to ingest these fruits and disperse their seeds.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the antimicrobial activity of commercially available <b>honey</b> <b>and</b> raw <b>honey</b> samples in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, against pathogenic bacterial strains. MethodsWell diffusion assays {{were performed to}} screen pure <b>and</b> diluted <b>honey</b> samples for antibacterial activity against six Gram-negative and six Gram-positive bacterial strains. Zones of inhibition were measured and compared with 10 mg Gentamycin. RESULTSWhen honey samples were diluted to 20 %- 70 %, the honey samples showed no activity to mild antibacterial activity. The highest antibacterial activity was recorded when 90 % <b>and</b> pure undiluted <b>honey</b> samples were tested and compared with a control Gentamycin disc (10 mg).

5|$|The 19th century saw {{considerable}} {{economic development}} which turned the small agricultural town of Chamonix into {{a base for}} tourists, with luxurious hotels and mountain lodges being built to accommodate them.

Andrew Scarlett, a Perthshire-based bee farmer <b>and</b> <b>honey</b> packer, lost 80% of his 1,200 hives during the 2009/10 winter. He attributed the losses to a virulent bacterial infection that quickly spread {{because of a lack of}} bee inspectors, coupled with sustained poor weather that prevented honey bees from building up sufficient pollen and nectar stores.|$|E

5|$|Fructose, {{or fruit}} sugar, occurs {{naturally}} in fruits, some root vegetables, cane sugar <b>and</b> <b>honey</b> {{and is the}} sweetest of the sugars. It {{is one of the}} components of sucrose or table sugar. It is used as a high-fructose syrup, which is manufactured from hydrolyzed corn starch that has been processed to yield corn syrup, with enzymes then added to convert part of the glucose into fructose.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{was popular}} {{and could be}} served fresh, dried, or preserved, and was a common {{ingredient}} in many cooked dishes. Since sugar <b>and</b> <b>honey</b> were both expensive, it was common to include many types of fruit in dishes that called for sweeteners of some sort. The fruits of choice in the south were lemons, citrons, bitter oranges (the sweet type was not introduced until several hundred years later), pomegranates, quinces, and, of course, grapes. Farther north, apples, pears, plums, and strawberries were more common. Figs and dates were eaten all over Europe, but remained rather expensive imports in the north.|$|E
5|$|If countershading paints out shadows, the reverse, darkening {{the belly}} and {{lightening}} the back, would maximise contrast by {{adding to the}} natural fall of light. This pattern of animal coloration is found in animals like the skunk <b>and</b> <b>honey</b> badger with strong defences—the offensive stink of the skunk, and the sharp claws, aggressive nature and stink of the honey badger. These animals do not run when under attack, but move slowly, often turning to face the danger, and giving deimatic or threat displays either to startle inexperienced predators, or as an aposematic signal, to warn off experienced ones.|$|E

In this respect, differentiation between blossom <b>honeys</b> <b>and</b> some honeydew <b>honeys</b> is still an unresolved task. This study includes the results of physicochemical and melissopalynological analysis of 86 honey samples from north-western Spain. The relationship between the microscopic elements in honey, such as Metschnikowia cells and fungal spores from plant pathogens, together with their physicochemical parameters were analysed. A cluster analysis was performed to differentiate blossom honey samples from honeydew samples.

5|$|In {{its native}} range, the {{sycamore}} {{is associated with}} a biodiverse range of invertebrates and fungi, but these are not always present in areas to which it has been introduced. It is sometimes planted in urban areas for its value as an amenity tree and produces a hard-wearing, creamy-white close-grained timber that is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, wood flooring and kitchen utensils. It also makes good firewood. The rising sap in spring has been used to extract sugar and make alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, <b>and</b> <b>honey</b> is made by bees collecting the nectar.|$|E
