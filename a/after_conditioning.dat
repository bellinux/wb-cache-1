2500|$|In 1975, Robert Ader and Nicholas Cohen, at the University of Rochester, {{advanced}} PNI {{with their}} demonstration of classic conditioning of immune function, and they subsequently {{coined the term}} [...] "psychoneuroimmunology". Ader was investigating how long conditioned responses (in the sense of Pavlov's conditioning of dogs to drool when they heard a bell ring) might last in laboratory rats. To condition the rats, he used a combination of saccharin-laced water (the conditioned stimulus) and the drug Cytoxan, which unconditionally induces nausea and taste aversion and suppression of immune function. Ader was {{surprised to discover that}} <b>after</b> <b>conditioning,</b> just feeding the rats saccharin-laced water was associated with the death of some animals and he proposed that they had been immunosuppressed after receiving the conditioned stimulus. Ader (a psychologist) and Cohen (an immunologist) directly tested this hypothesis by deliberately immunizing conditioned and unconditioned animals, exposing these and other control groups to the conditioned taste stimulus, and then measuring the amount of antibody produced. [...] The highly reproducible results revealed that conditioned rats exposed to the conditioned stimulus were indeed immuno suppressed. In other words, a signal via the nervous system (taste) was affecting immune function. This {{was one of the first}} scientific experiments that demonstrated that the nervous system can affect the immune system.|$|E

40|$|Animals form memory {{types that}} differ in {{duration}} and stability. The initial anaesthesia-sensitive memory (ASM) {{can be replaced}} by anaesthesia-resistant memory (ARM), and/or by protein synthesis-dependent, long-term memory (LTM). We previously showed that two closely related parasitic wasp species differ in learning rate and memory consolidation. In Cotesia glomerata, LTM lasting at least 24 h was formed <b>after</b> single-trial <b>conditioning,</b> whereas single-trial conditioning led to ARM that waned before 24 h in Cotesia rubecula. This species formed LTM only <b>after</b> repeated <b>conditioning</b> trials spaced in time. Here, we used artificial selection on learning rate to investigate whether selection for a low learning rate in C. glomerata would result in C. rubecula-like memory dynamics. Memory consolidation was tested by using cold-shock anaesthesia and protein synthesis inhibitors. <b>After</b> single-trial <b>conditioning,</b> ARM was consolidated within hours in unselected C. rubecula, but directly, without an intermediate ARM phase, into LTM in unselected C. glomerata. We obtained low learning rate selection lines of C. glomerata wasps that, like C. rubecula, did not form LTM <b>after</b> single-trial <b>conditioning,</b> to see whether such wasps would then consolidate ARM instead of LTM. We showed {{that this was not}} the case. The selected wasps formed LTM <b>after</b> repeated, spaced <b>conditioning</b> trials, but formed only ASM without consolidation of ARM or LTM after single-trial learning. Ecological consequences of this type of memory formation are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{classical}} conditioning, {{the temporal}} sequence of stimulus presentations {{is critical for}} the association between the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the unconditioned stimulus (US). In forward conditioning, the CS precedes the US and is learned as a predictor for the US. Thus it acquires properties to elicit a behavioral response, defined as excitatory properties. In backward conditioning, the US precedes the CS. The CS might be learned as a predictor for the cessation of the US acquiring inhibitory properties that inhibit a behavioral response. Interestingly, behavior <b>after</b> backward <b>conditioning</b> is controlled by both excitatory and inhibitory properties of the CS, but the underlying mechanisms determining which of these opposing properties control behavior upon retrieval is poorly understood. We performed conditioning experiments in the honeybee (Apis mellifera) to investigate the CS properties that control behavior at different time points <b>after</b> backward <b>conditioning.</b> The CS properties, as characterized by the retardation or enhancement of subsequent acquisition, were examined 30 min and 24 h <b>after</b> backward <b>conditioning.</b> We found that 30 min <b>after</b> backward <b>conditioning,</b> the CS acquired an inhibitory property during backward conditioning depending on the intertrial interval, the number of trials, and the odor used as the CS. One day <b>after</b> backward <b>conditioning,</b> we observed significant retardation of acquisition. In addition, we demonstrated an enhanced, generalized odor response in the backward conditioned group compared to untreated animals. These results indicate that two long-lasting opposing memories have been formed in parallel: one about the excitatory properties of the CS and one about the inhibitory properties of the CS. 9 page(s...|$|R

50|$|<b>After</b> <b>conditioning,</b> the {{recruits}} underwent weapons training; this was deemed of such importance that weapons instructors generally received double rations. Legionaries {{were trained to}} thrust with their gladii because they could defend themselves behind their large shields (scuta) while stabbing the enemy. These training exercises began with thrusting a wooden gladius and throwing wooden pila into a quintain (wooden dummy or stake) while wearing full armor. Their wooden swords and pila were designed to be twice as heavy as their metal counterparts so that the soldiers could wield a true gladius with ease. Next, soldiers progressed to armatura, a term for sparring that was also {{used to describe the}} similar one-on-one training of gladiators. Unlike earlier training, the wooden weapons used for armatura were the same weight as the weapons they emulated. Vegetius notes that roofed halls were built to allow for these drills to continue throughout the winter.|$|E
50|$|Lesion {{studies in}} animals, or studies in human {{subjects}} with lesions in known brain areas, provide important {{ways in which}} to investigate the consolidation process. For instance, animals can be trained in simple classical conditioning tasks to probe their ability to form and maintain new motor skills, with reversible lesions performed at various time points after training. One such study used muscimol injections in the cerebellum to demonstrate that inactivation of the cerebellum 5 or 45 minutes <b>after</b> <b>conditioning</b> impairs retention of newly acquired motor skills, but inactivation of the cerebellum 90 minutes afterward {{has no effect on}} the consolidation process. Similarly, humans with cerebellar lesions demonstrate retention of motor skills learned prior to the lesion, but an inability to form new skills after the lesion. Together, these studies indicate that the cerebellum is necessary for the consolidation process, but is not required for the long term retention of motor skills.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT We have {{investigated}} the voltage-dependent effects of the dihydropyridine Bay K 8644 on Ca channel currents in calf Purkinje fibers and enzymatically dispersed rat ventricular myocytes. Bay K 8644 increases the apparent rate of inactivation of these currents, measured during depolarizing voltage pulses, and shifts both channel activation and inactivation in the hyperpolarizing direction. Consequently, currents measured <b>after</b> hyperpolarizing <b>conditioning</b> pulses are larger {{in the presence of}} drug compared with control conditions, but are smaller than control if they are measured <b>after</b> positive <b>conditioning</b> pulses. Most of our experimental observations on macroscopic currents can be explained by a single drug-induced change in one rate constant of a simple kinetic model. The rate constant change is consistent with results obtained by others with single channel recordings...|$|R
40|$|Permanent lesions in {{the medial}} prefrontal cortex (mPFC) affect {{acquisition}} of conditioned responses (CRs) during trace eyeblink conditioning {{and retention of}} remotely acquired CRs. To clarify further roles of the mPFC {{in this type of}} learning, we investigated the participation of the mPFC in mnemonic processes both during and <b>after</b> daily <b>conditioning</b> using local microinfusion of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol or the NMDA receptor antagonist APV into the rat mPFC. Muscimol infusions into the mPFC before daily conditioning significantly retarded CR acquisition and reduced CR expression if applied after sufficient learning. APV infusion also impaired acquisition of CRs, but not expression of well-learned CRs. When infusions were made immediately <b>after</b> daily <b>conditioning,</b> acquisition of the CR was partially impaired in both the muscimol and APV infusion groups. In contrast, rats that received muscimol infusions 3 h <b>after</b> daily <b>conditioning</b> exhibited improvement in their CR performance comparable to that of the control group. Both the pre- and post-conditioning infusion of muscimol had no effect on acquisition in the delay paradigm. These results suggest that the mPFC participates in both acquisition of a CR and the early stage of consolidation of memory in trace, but not delay eyeblink conditioning by NMDA receptor-mediated operations...|$|R
50|$|The Rescorla-Wagner model {{argues that}} {{there is a limit to}} the amount of {{conditioning}} that can occur in the pairing of two stimuli. One determinant of this limit is the nature of the US. For example: pairing a bell with a juicy steak is more likely to produce salivation than pairing the bell with a piece of dry bread, and dry bread is likely to work better than a piece of cardboard. A key idea behind the R-W model is that a CS signals or predicts the US. One might say that before conditioning, the subject is surprised by the US. However, <b>after</b> <b>conditioning,</b> the subject is no longer surprised, because the CS predicts the coming of the US. (Note that the model can be described mathematically and that words like predict, surprise, and expect are only used to help explain the model.) Here the workings of the model are illustrated with brief accounts of acquisition, extinction, and blocking. The model also predicts a number of other phenomena, see main article on the model.|$|E
50|$|Recent studies {{combining}} odor {{conditioning and}} cellular imaging have identified six memory traces that coincide with molecular {{changes in the}} Drosophila olfactory system. Three of these traces are associated with early forming behavioral memory. One such trace was visualized in the antennal lobe (AL) by synapto-pHluorin reporter molecules. Immediately <b>after</b> <b>conditioning,</b> an additional set of projection neurons {{in a set of}} eight glomeruli in the AL becomes synaptically activated by the conditioned odor, and lasts for only 7 minutes. A second trace is detectable by GCaMP expression, and thus an increase in Ca2+ influx, in the α’/β’ axons of the mushroom body neurons. This is a longer-lasting trace, present for up to one hour following conditioning. The third memory trace is the reduction of activity of the anterior-paired lateral neuron, which acts as a memory formation suppressor through one of its inhibitory GABAergic receptors. Decrease in calcium response of APL neurons and subsequent decrease in GABA release onto the mushroom bodies persisted up to 5 minutes after odor conditioning.|$|E
50|$|The Rescorla-Wagner model ("R-W") is a {{model of}} {{classical}} conditioning, in which learning is conceptualized in terms of associations between conditioned (CS) and unconditioned (US) stimuli. A strong CS-US association means, essentially, that the CS signals or predicts the US. One might say that before conditioning, the subject is surprised by the US, but <b>after</b> <b>conditioning,</b> the subject is no longer surprised, because the CS predicts the coming of the US. The model casts the conditioning processes into discrete trials, during which stimuli may be either present or absent. The strength of prediction of the US on a trial can be represented as the summed associative strengths of all CSs present during the trial. This feature of the model represented a major advance over previous models, and it allowed a straightforward explanation of important experimental phenomena, most notably the blocking effect. Failures of the model have led to modifications, alternative models, and many additional findings. The model has had some impact on neural science in recent years, as studies have suggested that the phasic activity of dopamine neurons in mesostriatal DA projections in the midbrain encodes for the type of prediction error detailed in the model.|$|E

50|$|Histone {{methylation}} marks {{are also}} correlated with other epigenetic modifications, such as histone deacetylation and DNA methylation, {{in the context}} of learning and memory. Reduced histone deacetylation is correlated with an increase in H3K9 dimethylation, a modification associated with transcriptional silencing. Therefore, histone deacetylase inhibitors may be applied to increase histone acetylation and suppress H3K9 dimethylation, thereby increasing gene transcription. In the case of DNA methylation, it was found that increases in H3K4 trimethylation correlate with altered DNA methylation of CpG sites at the promoter of Zif268, a gene involved in memory formation, <b>after</b> fear <b>conditioning.</b> Gupta et al. showed that DNA methylation at the Zif268 promoter increased <b>after</b> fear <b>conditioning,</b> correlating with an increase in Zif268 gene expression.

40|$|AbstractExcessive {{levels of}} B cell {{activating}} factor (BAFF) {{are found in}} patients with active chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). In mice, BAFF {{has been shown to}} be essential for B cell recovery after myeloablation. To assess how BAFF levels relate to transplantation factors and subsequent development of cGVHD, we prospectively monitored 412 patients in the first year after allogeneic peripheral blood or bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and censored data at time of cGVHD onset. In patients who did not develop cGVHD, we affirmed a temporal pattern of gradually decreasing BAFF levels as B cell numbers increase <b>after</b> myeloablative <b>conditioning.</b> In contrast, <b>after</b> reduced-intensity <b>conditioning,</b> BAFF levels remained high throughout the first post-HSCT year, suggesting that the degree of myeloablation resulted in delayed B cell recovery associated with persistence of higher BAFF levels. Given that high BAFF/B cell ratios have been associated with active cGVHD, we examined differences in early BAFF/B cell ratios and found significantly different BAFF/B cell ratios at 3 months post-HSCT only <b>after</b> myeloablative <b>conditioning</b> in patients who subsequently developed cGVHD. In addition to HSCT conditioning type, the use of sirolimus was significantly associated with higher BAFF levels after HSCT, and this also was potentially related to lower B cell numbers. Taken together, our results are important for interpreting BAFF measurements in cGVHD biomarker studies...|$|R
