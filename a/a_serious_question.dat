60|$|THE {{question}} of time was now <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>question</b> at Morwick Farm. In six weeks {{the court for}} the trial of criminal cases was to be opened at Narrabee.|$|E
6000|$|RAMSDEN. I am sorry, Annie, {{to force}} {{business}} on {{you at a}} sad time like the present. But your poor dear father's will has raised <b>a</b> very <b>serious</b> <b>question.</b> You have read it, I believe? ...|$|R
6000|$|... ... Are you strong enough--are you strong enough, {{even with}} my help--to set your foot upon the necks of Sumner, Heintzelman, and Keyes, all at once? This is a {{practical}} and <b>a</b> very <b>serious</b> <b>question</b> for you.|$|R
50|$|The tribal {{community}} faces the new threats {{of development and}} conflicts, posing <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>questions</b> on its existence and civilization. For instance, the displacement and migration of Gotti koyas tribals taking place in Andhra Pradesh. In the absence of land and access to a forest, the Koyas depend on wage labour in farm lands. The scarcity of these jobs lead to malnutrition of children and instances of anemia in women.The Andhra Pradesh state government proposed Polavaram Project is posing <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> threat of displacement of 170,275 Koyas of the tribal population and more than 276 villages in the Khammam district of Bhadrachalam, Palwancha divisions.|$|R

60|$|For {{the moment}} the boys {{did not know what}} to do. Si Peters and his crowd had run off with their row-boat, and how to get to the {{mainland}} was <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E
60|$|The look of uneasy {{expectation}} reappeared {{in the eye}} of Mr. Bishopriggs. It was a question--and <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>question,</b> {{from his}} point of view--whether any suspicion of theft was attached to the disappearance of the letter.|$|E
2500|$|Cosmology {{may be said}} to {{have become}} <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> {{research}} <b>question</b> with the publication of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity in 1915 although it did not enter the scientific mainstream until the period known as the [...] "Golden age of general relativity".|$|R
5000|$|... by abandoning that {{distinction}} and allowing searches {{on less than}} probable cause where the government is primarily seeking criminal prosecution, Section 218 raises <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> constitutional <b>question.</b> Thus, Section 218 was not only unnecessary {{to bring down the}} wall, but may render FISA unconstitutional.|$|R
50|$|Attempts at revitalizing the {{municipality}} have, however, not been successful. In June 2011, the multinational company BBDO, citing over 150 attacks on their staff by locals, posted {{an open letter}} to then mayor Philippe Moureaux, announcing its withdrawal from the town. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, <b>serious</b> <b>questions</b> were raised about governance, security and the administration of Moureaux.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have the}} strongest {{possible}} objection, Zack, to talking nonsense where <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>question</b> is concerned. Are you, {{or are you}} not, in earnest in your dislike of commerce and your resolution to be an artist?" ...|$|E
60|$|The other {{boat was}} in sight, {{but a good}} half mile away, and it was <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>question</b> whether the Polly could get {{anywhere}} near the craft before the point with the three rocks was gained.|$|E
6000|$|Bernard {{gave her}} a {{grateful}} smile, but while he smiled, he asked himself <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>question.</b> [...] "Why the deuce does she go on flattering me?--You have always been very kind to me," [...] he said aloud.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} recent papers have raised <b>serious</b> <b>questions</b> about the {{validity}} of the German dominance hypothesis, using Granger (temporal) causality tests. If Germany dominates within the European Monetary System, then German monetary policy, measured by either money stocks or interest rates should Granger (temporally) cause other EMS countries’ monetary policies, but not vice versa. Empirical evidence leads analysts to conclude that the German dominance hypothesis is invalid, or at a minimum, in need of significant reformulation. Explores similar Granger causality tests, using the recent cointegration and error-correction modelling strategy, for the US and a group of developing countries during the Bretton Woods period, where conventional wisdom suggests that US policy dominated. Finds significant evidence of two-way causality between the US money stock and the money stocks {{of a large number of}} developing countries. These findings raise <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>questions</b> about the interpretation and/or appropriateness of the Granger causality test for investigating policy dominance hypotheses.

6000|$|... "Girls {{often put}} on that air," [...] she said. [...] "It's {{one of their}} ways of teasing. But then, if the man was really very much in love, and she was only enough in love to be {{uncertain}} of herself, she might very well seem troubled. It would be <b>a</b> very <b>serious</b> <b>question.</b> Girls often don't {{know what to do}} in such a case." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{she said}} this she looked into her uncle's face, smiling indeed, but still asking <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>question.</b> He dared to make no answer, but by his face he told the truth. He had {{declared}} his wishes to his nephew.|$|E
60|$|Usually it is a {{cold day}} in July when you can stroll up Broadway in that month and get a story out of the drama. I found one a few breathless, {{parboiling}} days ago, {{and it seems to}} decide <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>question</b> in art.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I like Uncle Roger," [...] {{said the}} Story Girl meditatively. [...] "He {{is big and}} jolly. But he teases people too much. You ask him <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>question</b> {{and you get a}} ridiculous answer. He hardly ever scolds or gets cross, though, and THAT is something. He is an old bachelor." ...|$|E
50|$|However, Moureaux's {{attempts}} at revitalizing the municipality {{have not been}} successful. An example was the withdrawal of BBDO in June 2011 from the town. In an open letter addressed to Moureaux, ten employees of this American advertising agency cited over 150 attacks on their staff by locals as principal reason for their departure. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, <b>serious</b> <b>questions</b> have been raised about governance, security, and the administration of Mayor Moureaux.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} use of Information {{and communication}} tTechnologies (ICTs) for development in India has begun to throw pointers towards their potential. Since most interventions continue to be confined to small geographical pockets, touching the lives of only <b>a</b> few, <b>serious</b> <b>questions</b> emerge regarding the success of such interventions. This scepticism has been compounded by questions about the capability of such enterprises to foster sustainable economic development and social transformation in India...|$|R

60|$|The Thanksgiving {{story is}} mostly {{confined}} in scene to the country; {{it does not}} seem possible to do much with it in town; and it is <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>question</b> whether with its geographical and topical limitations it can hold its own against the Christmas story; and whether it would not be well for authors to consider a combination with its elder rival.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Hardy spoke cheerfully, but {{his wife}} saw at once that it was with an effort that he did so. She put down the work upon which she was engaged, and moved her chair nearer to his by the fire. [...] "It is <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>question,</b> Frank, about the boys. Charley is fifteen now, and Hubert fourteen. I wonder myself {{sometimes}} what we shall do with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, and then--YOU know, godmother. We'll both jump up {{into the}} coach and six and go to Lizzie. This reminds me, godmother, to ask you <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>question.</b> You are as wise as wise can be (having been brought up by the fairies), {{and you can tell}} me this: Is it better to have had a good thing and lost it, or never to have had it?' ...|$|E
50|$|As a result, the {{question}} of whether the Standard Model of particle physics is nontrivial (and whether elementary scalar Higgs particles can exist) remains <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> unresolved <b>question.</b> Theoretical proofs evidencing triviality of the scalar field theory have appeared, but the nature of the quantum field theories interacting with it remains an open question.Implications for the Standard Model and the resulting Higgs Boson mass bounds have also been discussed.|$|R
6000|$|Again she paused. [...] "You have a {{right to}} an answer,--of course; but it may be so {{difficult}} to give it. It {{seems to me that you}} have hardly realised how <b>serious</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> it is." ...|$|R
40|$|Decline in {{military}} useful ships is one {{indication of the}} general decline in the U. S. merchant marine since the massive Liberty and Victory programs of World War II. As the statistics in Part II will show, the U. S. flag merchant marine is facing possible nonexistence if a resurgence is not realized within this decade. Numbers of ships {{is only a small}} part of a complicated problem, however. <b>A</b> more <b>serious</b> <b>question</b> is the idea of a militarily useful hull...|$|R

60|$|Lady Pollacke rose to {{her feet}} and stood looking down on me like a hen, though not exactly a motherly one. But this was <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>question</b> over which I must not be flustered, so I took my time. I folded my hands, and fixed a long, long look on Mrs Monnerie. Even after all these years, I confess it moves me to recall it.|$|E
60|$|This was <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>question,</b> for Anderson Rover {{knew well}} the risk he was running, knew well that many {{a white man}} {{had gone into the}} {{interior}} of Africa never to return. At last it was settled that Randolph Rover should become Dick, Tom, and Sam's temporary guardian. This accomplished, Anderson Rover set off {{and that was the last}} any of his family had ever heard of him.|$|E
5000|$|In {{her book}} Red Azalea, Anchee Min {{describes}} her experiences with Mao's didactic creation, the revolutionary opera. She became a fan initially {{because there were}} not many other forms of diversion. [...] "Entertainment was a 'dirty bourgeois word'," [...] but the revolutionary operas {{were supposed to be}} something else, [...] "a proletarian statement." [...] To love or not to love the operas was <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> political <b>question,</b> Min writes, and [...] "meant to be or not to be a revolutionary." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{momentary}} levity {{of expression}} vanished from Horace's face.

40|$|The debate {{during the}} summer {{highlighted}} how a low skill labour shortage could seriously impact future UK harvests post ‘Brexit’. Now, it is {{the turn of the}} retail sector to raise their very serious concerns with supporting the UK’s retail supply chains to meet with their delivery promises. We already know many of the UK’s short term distribution operations are staffed by labour that originates from the European Union (EU), in particular the Eastern European nations.
