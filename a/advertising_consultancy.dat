40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the determinants of the changing importance of major cities as globalized service centers in the period 2000 - 2008. Drawing on the theoretical research of Saskia Sassen and the subsequent empirical research of the Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) group, the spatio-temporal dynamics of the world urban system is measured through a systematic assessment of changes in the geography of the office networks of leading globalized service firms between 2000 and 2008. This calculation of the changing position of 308 cities across the world is thereupon used as the dependent variable in a model through which we test a number of hypotheses concerning the determinants of change. Our study analyzes urban-economic change both in general and in sectoral terms (finances, accountancy, law, <b>advertising,</b> management <b>consultancy).</b> We also investigate how the changing network structures of firms from the same sector and from other sectors influence a firms' location strategy in a worldwide urban geography...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} a {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} competitiveness and performance of business-service companies in two peripheral regions, Nova Scotia and Scotland, is presented. Several dimensions of performance are investigated for four industries: market research, management <b>consultancy,</b> <b>advertising,</b> and graphic design. Value added per person is one third higher in Scotland compared with Nova Scotia, and Nova Scotian offices derive a much higher proportion of their turnover from government and public-sector contracts. In general, however, a very consistent picture emerges of the relative position of business services in the two regions. Possible demand-side and supply-side causes of such differences are reviewed and potential policy responses considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{current state}} of Human Factors (HF) in Product Design (PD) is {{discussed}} within this paper. An analysis of <b>consultancies,</b> <b>advertised</b> jobs, the inclusive design area and product exemplars were conducted. Results showed that HF does not currently appear to {{play a significant role}} in the design of products. In order to address current and future societal changes e. g. the ageing population, HF needs to become the central emphasis of PD processes. A proposed way of addressing this is detailed in the form of a new educational pathway that combines HF and PD. It is envisaged that such a pathway would create individuals with necessary skill sets to address the societal challenges we face and overcome the barriers currently posed in this relationship...|$|R

TerraChoice Environmental Marketing, an <b>advertising</b> <b>consultancy</b> company, issued a report denoting a 79% increase in the usage of corporate greenwashing between 2007 and 2009. Additionally, it has begun to manifest itself in new varied ways. Within the non-residential building products market in the United States, some companies are beginning to claim that their environmentally minded policy changes will allow them to earn points through the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating program. This point system has been held up {{as an example of the}} [...] "gateway effect" [...] that the drive to market products as environmentally friendly is having on company policies. Jim Nicolow, AIA, LEED Fellow, leader of architecture and planning firm Lord, Aeck & Sargent's sustainable design initiative has claimed that the greenwashing trend may be enough to eventually effect a genuine reduction in environmentally damaging practices. According to the Home and Family Edition, 95% consumer products claiming to be green were discovered to commit at least one of the [...] "Sins of Greenwashing".

The authors try in particular to evaluate the weight of two types of location factors : the classical " hard factors ", such as business opportunities, accessibility, availability of dwellings, infrastructures and tax incentives, and several " soft factors ", related to more immaterial conditions such as atmosphere, tolerance of the population or cultural diversity of the region. This study is based on current theories on urban competitiveness, focusing {{on the importance of}} individual choices and the changing working conditions in a context of a global and increasingly dematerialised economy...|$|R

STMIK stands for 'schools for technology, management, information and computers'. The academy concentrates on innovative technologies. It has an enrollment of more than 7,600 students, which compares strongly with nearby institutions that are closing because of a shortage of students. The academy produces graduates who are very popular in the labour market. The academy also runs several commercial enterprises: television channels, radio channels, cartoon production, software design, internet services, <b>advertising,</b> computer systems, <b>consultancy</b> and mobile networks. These commercial setups also provide valuable ground for student internships.

40|$|An organisation’s {{survival}} {{is dependent on}} the support of a number of stakeholders. However, professional service firms tend to lose the support of their most important stakeholders, which are their well-educated employees, also referred to as their ‘talents’. This study has used Harrison and Wicks’ (2013) framework of stakeholder value creation as its point of departure, which consists of four value aspects: goods and services, organisational justice, organisational affiliation, and opportunity cost. The framework states that managerial actions, related to these four aspects, are likely to create value for stakeholders by increasing their happiness. “Happy” stakeholders are further considered to keep supporting their organisation, which generated the principal research question of this study: How can professional service firms increase the happiness of their talents? Moreover, the study was limited to neo and classic-professional service firms, which include: <b>consultancy,</b> <b>advertising,</b> accountancy, architecture, and law firms. In order to explore what managerial actions increase talents’ happiness, a case study was conducted at a British law firm. Nine solicitors of three different levels of seniority were interviewed and the firm was observed for two days. This study not only confirms the validity of Harrison and Wicks’ (2013) framework but also extends it by identifying additional managerial actions, categories for analysing ‘talent happiness’ as well as a fifth value aspect: ‘job characteristics’. In a broader perspective, this study contributes to stakeholder theory by providing an empirical and micro-level illustration of the theory. ...|$|R
40|$|Public {{transport}} {{industry is}} facing challenging times. Fuel costs are rising meanwhile subsidies are decreasing and in addition, {{the economic crisis}} and new mobility trends are putting more pressure into the system with higher demand. Raising revenues and reducing cost is a mantra for all public transport operators: {{it is now time}} to do more with less but with more customers. Providers are changing trying to go beyond their local borders (merging in major groups), improving travel experience (real time and mobile communications) and diversifying revenues sources (<b>advertising</b> and <b>consultancy).</b> In most developed country we are observing a strong change in urban mobility trends that reflect a less intensive use of cars. For the first time we are recording decreasing number in license holding among younger generation. Furthermore it was noticed that driving distance reached a peak at the beginning of 2000 and after a period of stability is now declining. This put a stronger pressure on PT operators that has to meet customer expectation with shrunken budget. Due to new financial cuts, many companies should also work to maximise revenues. Some are just starting to establish interactions with customers using mobile technologies. This could allow collecting data and conducting surveys at lower costs, {{in order to get a}} better insight into the demand and provides new services according to specific travel needs of the citizens. In addition using smart technologies, as e-ticketing, could lead in the future to have the opportunity to set dynamical fare scheme (peak and off-peak tickets). Analysis of travel applications based on open data clearly shows that the added value created for third parties, helps to enhance the travel experience (e-ticketing, travel planner, on time app) and to shape mobility (promotions, personalized fare). Lowering of public subsidies is forcing operators to rethink their business model, seeking new revenues streams. Diversification of economic sources could help avoiding fares increase and service cuts. Some operators are trying to expand into the consultancy sector selling their expertise in traffic systems or in project managing. Others are increasingly considering advertisement solutions in stations or in the rolling stock. Ultimately, transport companies are moving from simply local operator towards a more complex, bigger industry providing additional services and retail investment opportunities. The chapter shows that the future outlook of urban public transport will be influenced by three main pillars: budget pressure (decreasing budgets, cost control, new business model), mobility pattern changes (increasing in public transport demand) and new technologies (social media, smart apps).

40|$|Inaugural lecture for the {{personal}} Chair in Economics of Creative Industries, Faculty of History and ArtsThe {{title of this}} lecture is ‘Copyright and Creativity: cultural economics for the 21 st century’ and the title of my chair is Economics of Creative Industries, so I obviously think I {{have something to say}} about creativity. However, creativity is one of those words that has become completely debased by overuse: anything and everything is apparently ‘creative’ nowadays – not just industries and the economy but also <b>advertising,</b> salesmanship, management <b>consultancy</b> – even accountancy! And of course, artists are creative but then so are children and according to UNESCO we are all creative. Overuse has rendered it devoid of meaning – so, is it even worth investigating, especially from the economic point of view? The ‘creative economy’ has become a buzz word, a slogan, something that is unquestionably true. And it is easy to see why Ministries of Culture have embraced it so whole-heartedly: it empowers them to be in the forefront of the quest for economic growth, just as that other buzz word ‘the economic impact of the arts’ did 20 years ago. But Ministries of Economic Affairs are also on the bandwagon. So, if I am scornful of the endless appeal to the creative economy, why choose this theme? Well, the reason is that if these terms ‘creative economy’ and ‘creative industries’ are to be taken seriously (and governments from here to Uruguay have policies for them), economists should be capable of analysing them, especially cultural economists. Put simply: if the creative economy is such a good thing, can an economy be made more creative and if so, how? - do we know how to create creativity? Is it something that is amenable to social engineering? These questions have to be answered if we are to believe that government policies can promote the creative economy...|$|R
