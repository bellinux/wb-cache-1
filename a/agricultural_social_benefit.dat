40|$|AbstractEcosystem {{services}} {{have a significant}} impact on human wellbeing. While ecosystem services are frequently represented by monetary values, social values and underlying <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> remain underexplored. The purpose of this study is to assess whether and how <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> have been explicitly addressed within socio-economic and socio-cultural ecosystem services research, ultimately allowing a better understanding between ecosystem services and human well-being. In this paper, we reviewed 115 international primary valuation studies and tested four hypotheses associated to the identification of <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> of ecosystem services using logistic regressions. Tested hypotheses were that (1) <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> are mostly derived in studies that assess cultural ecosystem services as opposed to other ecosystem service types, (2) there is a pattern of <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> and certain cultural ecosystem services assessed simultaneously, (3) monetary valuation techniques go beyond expressing monetary values and convey <b>social</b> <b>benefits,</b> and (4) directly addressing stakeholdeŕs views the consideration of <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> in ecosystem service assessments. Our analysis revealed that (1) a variety of <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> are valued in studies that assess either of the four ecosystem service types, (2) certain <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> are likely to co-occur in combination with certain cultural ecosystem services, (3) of the studies that employed monetary valuation techniques, simulated market approaches overlapped most frequently with the assessment of <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> and (4) studies that directly incorporate stakeholder's views were more likely to also assess <b>social</b> <b>benefits...</b>|$|R

Additional research that examines the relationship between recreation and leisure activities (e. g. saltwater fishing) and <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> {{is needed to determine}} if such a relationship exists. The purpose of this project is to present the findings of a study done to determine the <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> of saltwater fishing. Data was collected by interviewing fishermen along North Carolina beaches participating in surf fishing, charter boat fishing, and pier fishing. Discussion focuses on the extent that <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> received through saltwater fishing compare to other recreational activities, to what extent is involvement in saltwater angling related to <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> received, and the relationship between participation frequency in saltwater fishing and <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> received...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to create a brief scale to measure perceived <b>social</b> <b>benefit</b> that would be appropriate for use in future research aiming to explore the role of this variable in determining word-of-mouth (WOM) behaviour. There is evidence that perceived social risk negatively impacts the willingness to share, but the role of perceived <b>social</b> <b>benefit</b> has not yet been explored. Understanding how perceived <b>social</b> risk and <b>benefit</b> interact to determine WOM will inform social marketing campaign design. Design/methodology/approach - This paper outlines two studies: Study 1 was concerned with the development of the perceived <b>social</b> <b>benefit</b> of sharing scale (PSBSS), including the construction of preliminary items and the reliability and discriminant validity of the final scale. Study 2 involved an investigation of the concurrent validity of the PSBSS in relation to the likelihood to share. Findings - Study 1 demonstrated that the perceived <b>social</b> <b>benefit</b> associated with WOM was related to social approval, impression management and social bonding. The results of Study 2 established that scores on the PSBSS predicted self-reported likelihood to engage in both face-to-face WOM and electronic WOM. Originality/value - The PSBSS can be used to examine the role of perceived <b>social</b> <b>benefit,</b> including how the interaction between perceived <b>social</b> risk and <b>benefit</b> determines where, when and with whom people will share WOM...|$|R

40|$|Major {{attempts}} to control the natural environment characterized government ‘developmental’ activity in twentieth-century Sind. This thesis argues that the construction of three barrage dams across the River Indus, along with a network of irrigation canals, enacted human control over nature as a political project. The Raj and its successor state in Sind, Pakistan, thereby claimed legitimacy through their capacity to benefit humans by re-modelling the landscape. These claims depended on an implied narrative of material progress, which irrigation development was expected to bring about, in a province considered technologically and socially backward. In allocating land that was newly made available for cultivation, government officials found an unprecedented opportunity to also re-shape agrarian society. As well as providing {{the means by which}} ‘ideal types’ of cultivator could be encouraged to proliferate, the development of Sind’s irrigation system was based on concepts of modernization that promoted increasing state intervention in agrarian life to render a ‘disordered’ society more easily governable. This trend was constrained, however, by successive administrations’ need to balance the lure of radical modernization against the powerful claims on new land of local magnates. The colonial belief in the <b>agricultural,</b> economic, and <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> of large-scale irrigation projects was transplanted into the post-colonial state. The construction of irrigation works, the colonization of land, and their political implications before and after Independence are therefore analyzed, in order to demonstrate how and why the logic of large infrastructure schemes remained consistent. At the same time, differences in how successive administrations framed and enacted barrage projects are shown to have depended on contemporary circumstances. In the process, the thesis sheds new light on the tensions between and within the central and provincial governments, demonstrating the contested nature of concepts of Imperial governance, nation-building, and material progress. <br/...|$|R
