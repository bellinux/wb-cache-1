5|$|Veronica {{learns that}} there may be a {{connection}} to a fraternity, and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) informs her that it is the secret society for which he is being recruited, the Castle. Wallace tells her that the equipment used to tape him was similar to that which was used to film Veronica and Piz. He starts to go through initiation with the group in order to ascertain the members' identities for Veronica. The members make him go into a room and ask him very personal questions, electrically shocking him if he answers untruthfully. When they find out that Veronica has sent Wallace, they forcibly remove him, but he is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> the identity of one of the other recruits. Veronica sneaks into the house of the recruit Wallace names and sees a large portrait of Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried). She hears voices and hides behind a curtain before two men emerge. They speak about the Castle, and Veronica discovers that one of them is Jake Kane. After they leave, Veronica steals his computers. Keith investigates the robbery the following day, spotting Veronica on surveillance cameras; however, he does not initially report his daughter. Veronica asks Mac (Tina Majorino) whether any computer could crack Jake's password, and she is taken to a supercomputer on campus.|$|E

The MIMO system consists of N transmit and M receive antennas. Unique signals, occupying the same frequency band, are sent via N transmit antennas and are received via M receive antennas. The signal arriving at each receive antenna will be a linear combination of the N transmitted signals forming a NxM transmission matrix H. It is crucial for the matrix H to be invertible for the receiver to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> the transmitted information.|$|E

2500|$|After the game, it was {{revealed}} that the Oilers coaching staff was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> the Chargers' coaches' signs as they signaled the play call from the sideline; this was one reason their defensive backs seemed to always be {{in the right place at}} the right time. [...] "We pretty much knew ahead of time when they were going to pass, and where they were going to pass it." [...] said Oilers defensive coordinator Ed Biles. It was a monumental upset against the heavily favored Chargers, who had scored at least 26 points in 10 games during the season and had defeated both eventual Super Bowl teams, the Rams and Steelers, by a combined scoring margin of 75-23.|$|E

The {{only child}} of a clone, she has {{inherited}} the apparent accelerated healing ability demonstrated by Sarah and Helena, and has shown the ability to tell the clones apart {{even when they are}} posing as each other. It would seem that her intelligence is greater than a normal child's, being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> Cal is her father within moments of meeting him, and that he needed a distraction {{to get rid of a}} suspicious cop; she also seems to have some of Sarah's skills as she was able to steal a nurse's phone during an examination without her notice and use it to call Cal. After Rudy threatens Kira, Sarah sends Kira to Iceland with her father Cal; they reunite in the third-season finale. In season four, Kira seems to have developed a latent psychic ability; she dreamed about her [...] "aunts" [...] killing Sarah because she was [...] "changing". (seasons 1–5) ...|$|E
2500|$|Giuliani gave much of {{the credit}} for a drop in 2001 crime to Kerik, saying that [...] "Commissioner Kerik took over a police {{department}} that was leading the country in crime declines, and somehow he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> how to create even more crime reduction and to do that against a national trend in which crime is going up in {{much of the}} rest of the country." [...] Known in the department as the [...] "beat-cop commissioner," [...] Kerik frequently cruised the city at night with a security detail composed of cops who had been in shootouts, dangled from rooftops, hit by bullets, raced into burning buildings, and seen their partners die. During his time as police commissioner he made five arrests, including one involving two ex-convicts—one a paroled killer, wanted for a carjacking at gunpoint in Virginia—for allegedly driving a stolen van in Harlem. As police commissioner, Kerik served on the terrorism committee with the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Criminal Justice Advisory Board for St. John's University.|$|E

2500|$|A {{majority}} of the band's previous material was written by former guitarist Ryan Ross. For Vices & Virtues, Urie had [...] "to step up and take the reins lyrically," [...] which he regarded as having not much experience in prior. The biggest inspiration for lyricism was keeping busy and going out, instead of locking themselves in and writing. Urie has regarded the lyrics as very honest and straightforward, as well as very fantastical with elements of storytelling. Urie explained [...] "We were so self-conscious about everything, hyper-aware of what we’re doing, that when we’re writing I go, [...] "Okay, I don’t {{want this to be}} Barry Manilow’s [...] "Mandy", but I want it to be as romantic and cute ...’ There’s a lot of that fighting within yourself. But it ended up being great, and I’m glad that we were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what we wanted to write about." [...] The lyrics also reflect the confusion after the departure of Ross and Walker. The sessions with Feldmann at his home studio led to experimentation with new sounds. [...] "We really loved Paul Simon and got into using marimbas and string instruments," [...] explains Urie. [...] "We ended up buying some synths and messing around with them. It was two kids in a candy store… and we listened to Arcade Fire's The Suburbs on repeat for me for the past… well, since it came out [...]" ...|$|E

Relapse was the first album and first recordings that I did when the lights went on and I was sober. I {{was still trying to}} figure things out...It's interesting. Fun time. I had a fun time." [...] and reiterated his feeling about the album [...] "I felt Relapse was, I don't know. I don't know if people know what I really had to go through {{to be able to make}} Relapse and to be able to write again and to be able to think again and just normal everyday bodily functions and functions in my mind. I don't want to say I wasn't in a place to record again, but I needed time. I needed time to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> things. I wanted to be able to make my songs feel like something again. I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, but a lot of the songs didn't really feel like anything. I had to go back and listen to some of my older music to try to figure out what I was doing wrong. Once I felt like I figured that out, I started making songs that felt like something again." ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{identification}} of influential users, also known as key opinion leaders, within the social network Instagram. Instagram is a very popular platform to share images with the option to categorise the images by certain tags. It is possible to collect public data from Instagram via the open API of the platform. This thesis presents a concept to create an automated crawler for this API and col- lect data into a database in order to apply algorithms from graph theory to identify opinion leaders afterwards. The sample topic for this thesis has been veganfood and all associated posts from Instagram have been crawled. After the user data has been crawled a graph has been created to do further research with common social network analysis tools. The graph contained a total set of more than 26, 000 nodes. To identify opinion leaders from this graph, five di↵erent metrics have been applied, in particular PageRank, Betweenness centrality, Closeness Centrality, Degree and Eigen- vector centrality. After applying the di↵erent algorithms {{the results have been}} eval- uated and additionally an marketing expert with focus on social media analysed the results. This project was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> {{that it is possible to}} find opinion leaders by using the PageRank algorithm and that those opinion leaders have a very good value of en- gagement. This indicates that they show a high interaction with other users on their posts. In conclusion the additional research options are discussed to provide a future outlook...|$|R
