40|$|Summary: In Britain, {{the use of}} "second-generation " rodenticides {{has become}} {{widespread}} on <b>agricultural</b> <b>premises.</b> The high toxicity and relatively long half-lives of these compounds has raised concerns over potential secondary exposure and poisoning of non-target predators. Over the last 15 years, exposure has been extensively documented in the barn owl Tyto alba but relatively {{little is known about}} mammalian terrestrial predators. This paper reviews recent studies and demonstrates that there is evidence of both secondary exposure and secondary poisoning in a variety of non-target, terrestrial mammals in Britain. It also presents new data on rodenticide levels in the polecat Mustela putorius which preys on farmyard rats in winter in Britain and is, therefore, considered to be highly vulnerable to exposure to rodenticides. The new data demonstrated that 26 % of polecats in the sample contained difenacoum or bromadiolone and that exposure was geographically widespread and occurred in several years. The possible effects of secondary exposure on populations of polecats and other predators are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Between 1988 and 1995 {{populations of}} rats on <b>agricultural</b> <b>premises</b> were sampled to {{investigate}} the distribution of anticoagulant-resistant rats in England and Wales. In total, approximately 1, 670 rats from 115 locations were tested for resistance to warfarin. Rats that were warfarin-resistant were subsequently tested for resistance to difenacoum, and since 1991 for resistance to bromadiolone. In some cases rats were also tested for resistance to brodifacoum, and in 1995 for resistance to flocoumafen. The results of these tests showed {{that there was a}} high prevalence of resistance to the first-generation anticoagulant, warfarin, in several regions of England and Wales. Rats from most populations sampled since 1991 appeared to be more resistant to bromadiolone than difenacoum, but in central southern England there were some populations where the reverse was true. In this same part of the country there was a relatively small focus where the rats had high degrees of resistance to several anticoagulant rodenticides. There was little evidence of resistance to brodifacoum or flocoumafen. The data are discussed with respect to the impact of anticoagulant rodenticide resistance on control of rats in the United Kingdom...|$|R

The central question of this work is how infectious diseases can potentially spread via trade in such a livestock population. We address this question by analyzing the underlying network of animal movements. In particular, we consider pig trade in Germany, where trade actors (<b>agricultural</b> <b>premises)</b> form a complex network. The considered pig trade dataset spans several years and is analyzed with respect to its potential to spread infectious diseases. Focusing on measurements of network-topological properties, we avoid the usage of external parameters, since these properties are independent of specific pathogens. They are on the contrary of great importance for understanding any general spreading process on this particular network. We analyze the system using different network models, which include varying amounts of information: (i) static network, (ii) network as a time series of uncorrelated snapshots, (iii) temporal network, where causality is explicitly taken into account. We find that a static network view captures many relevant aspects of the trade system, and premises can be classified into two clearly defined risk classes. Moreover, our results allow for an efficient allocation strategy for intervention measures using centrality measures. Data on trade volume do barely alter the results and is therefore of secondary importance. Although a static network description yields useful results, the temporal resolution of data plays an outstanding role for an in-depth understanding of spreading processes. This applies in particular for an accurate calculation of the maximum outbreak size...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I {{focus on}} methodological {{concepts}} of studying infectious disease transmission between <b>agricultural</b> <b>premises.</b> I used different disease systems as exemplars for spatial and network methods to investigate transmission patterns. Infectious diseases cause tangible economic {{threat to the}} farming industry worldwide by damaging livestock populations, reducing farm productivity and causing trade restriction. This implies the importance of veterinary epidemiological studies in control and eradication of pathogens. Recent increase in availability of data and computational power allowed for more opportunities to study mechanisms of pathogenic transmission. Nowadays, the bottleneck is primarily associated with efficient methods that can analyse vast amounts of high-resolution data. Here I address two livestock pathogens that differ in their epidemiology: bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus. Streptococcus agalactiae is a contagious pathogen that causes mastitis in cattle, and thus possesses a substantial economic burden to the dairy industry. Known transmission routes between cattle are restricted to those via milking machines, milkers’ hands and fomites during milking process. Additionally, recent studies suggested potential introductions from other host species: primarily, humans. However, strain typing data showed discrepancies in strain compositions of bacteria isolated from humans and bovines. In this thesis, strain-specific features of between-herd transmission of Streptococcus agalactiae within dairy cattle population in Denmark are investigated. Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a viral infection that affects cloven-hoofed animals and is of big importance {{mainly because of the}} trade restrictions against infected regions and countries. Control programmes against FMD usually include vaccination and culling of animals. However, the debate on the optimal control for FMD is still ongoing. In this thesis, I address questions on identification of the routes of infection and on requirements for movement recording systems to be used for efficient contact tracing during an FMD outbreak. This thesis reveals several interesting findings. Firstly, the increased understanding of strain-specific transmission characteristics of Streptococcus agalactiae. One of the observed strains (ST 103) showed significant and consistent spatial clustering of its cases among Danish dairy cattle herds in 2009 – 2011. Secondly, the network analysis of cattle movements and affiliations with veterinary practices showed that veterinary practices were exclusively associated with transmission of ST 103 of Streptococcus agalactiae. Contrastingly, movement networks appeared to be important for all the three predominant bacterial strains (ST 1, ST 23 and ST 103). Fourthly, the new extended approach that allows estimation of the whole transmission tree at once was proposed and tested for the Darlington cluster within the 2001 FMD UK epidemic. Finally, in chapter 6, it was shown that mathematical modelling did not suggest any advantages of ensuring smaller delays in the post-silent control of FMD-like pathogens. </p...|$|R
40|$|From {{the point}} of view of the Czech Republic in the last 80 years we can specify two periods, which had a significant impact on the general {{character}} and development in agriculture. The first period can be traced to the 50 s of the last century, in which the concentration of agricultural production headed towards to factory farming. The second one began at the beginning of the 90 s. At that time a sharp downtown of animal production occurred and the sooner concentrated production began, after the regaining by previous owners, to erode into what it is today private agriculture. This thesis aims tocontribute to a confirmation of rejection of the hypothesis that the above described changes have a negative impact on the selected avian species. These species are represented by significantsynanthropic birds: house sparrow (which is a crucial representative in this thesis), tree sparrow and collared dove. Thirty municipalities were chosen to emphasize the differences in quantity of these species, half of them located on each side of the border with the Czech Republic and Austria. The comparison of quantities of bird populations took place in the surroundings of the cities Znojmo and Retz. In this thesis the Republic of Austria acts as a country which has not been burdened by a substantial economic development and which has applied the continuous market economy since the end of the Second World War. In the individual squares the numbers of the representatives of the studied species and the environmental characteristics were recorded during the winter period. The significant differences in the numbers of birds at selected locations were demonstrated using a multifactor ANOVA STATISTICA 12. Moreover, the impact of selected environmental variables on the abundance of observed species was also analysed. It was found that the selected species depend on an inclusion into the individual states as well as on a classification into various biotope types. Finally, the dependence on the area of trees and bushes, the proportion of new buildings and the presence of poultry in the square were also observed. The most numerous species in the Republic of Austria was the house sparrow, the most abundant species in the Czech Republic was the collared dove. A slight increase in the occurrence of the collared dove was recorded in both states. Tree sparrow as a species occurred in relatively large numbers, but only locally. It was found that the populationsof the above mentioned species were generally more numerous in the Austrian municipalities. An interesting fact is that most of the observed individuals in the Czech Republic occurred in village built-up areas rather than in <b>agricultural</b> <b>premises,</b> as it was initially estimated...|$|R
40|$|In 2007, {{a global}} food crisis brought {{the topic of}} {{agriculture}} back into the public eye, and retriggered debates {{about the ability of}} agricultural industrialization to feed the world. As a nature-based process and an exception to capitalist industrialization, agriculture trends are difficult to assess. One of the more productive attempts to do so has developed conceptual tools that account for the distinction from typical capital accumulation patterns, notably Goodman, Sorj, and Wilkinson’s (1987) classic concepts of “appropriationism” and “substitutionism. ” Agricultural biotechnologies are testing the limits of even these more refined conceptualizations, as the technologies’ associated proprietary framework — including seed saving restrictions, grower contracts, and patent infringement litigation — is reorganizing many traditional agricultural practices. Drawing on case studies in Mississippi, U. S. and Saskatchewan, Canada, this paper argues that these trends suggest a need for a new concept in political economy of agriculture theory, which I term “expropriationism. ” This concept identifies several aspects of an <b>agricultural</b> reorganization <b>premised</b> on legal means to enhance capital accumulation and on separating corporate ownership from liability. This accumulation strategy has important implications given the high salience that agriculture has for society.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{new stage}} of rural reform, faced {{universal}} transfer of land contract rights, {{one of the}} most important tasks of rural system construction is accelerating development of agricultural insurance in China. However, agricultural insurance does not function efficiently enough to accord effective protection to farmers in land contract rights transfer, and agricultural insurance and transfer of land contract rights become a dual dilemma. To address this difficulty, <b>agricultural</b> insurance is <b>premised</b> to improve the implementation of land contract rights transfer, in which appropriate safeguards are acquired. Thus, the introduction of game theory is necessary and feasible for analyzing the strategy by which farmers select agricultural insurance and land contracts. Based on game analysis, the “players” are the agricultural insurance and land contracts encountered by farmers; “strategy” is composed of agricultural insurance and land contract selection behaviors. Farmer behavior can achieve equilibrium of anticipated profits. Equilibrium then yields the “outcome,” which is the cooperation and win-win solutions that may be achieved between agricultural insurance and transfer of land contract rights. Thus, in the rational selection process of farmers, agricultural insurance and transfer of land contract rights can facilitate positive support, interaction, and development. These will help realize overall progress in system innovation with respect to agricultural insurance...|$|R
50|$|Brick {{building}} at Bishop's Waltham {{dates back to}} the 1860s. The founder, Mark Blanchard, had died in 1892 and his son, also named Mark, took over the business. However, by 1818, he decided to retire and, as he there was no successor in the family, he decided to sell the business. Elliotts paid £8,000 for the brickworks, stock and railway sidings. A new company was formed with Walter Elliott as managing director. The works were extended and equipment was renewed where necessary. Amongst other local buildings, the bricks were used for extensions to Southampton University College, the institution that was to become the University of Southampton in 1952. On the death of Walter Elliot in 1935, his nephew, Mason Elliott became chairman. During a bombing raid in the summer of 1941 the works were extensively damaged. The raid halted brick-making operations and it was not until 1947 that production was resumed. However, even by 1956 production was uneconomic with an annual output of only 1,500,000 bricks and 650,000 tiles. The site was therefore put up for auction but, there being no acceptable offers, it was withdrawn and, after redevelopment, became Elliotts' first branch sales and distribution depot. It served in this capacity until the early 1980s when Elliotts purchased the Claylands Road, Bishop's Waltham depot of Ben Turner & Son. Turners were a supplier of <b>agricultural</b> machinery.

[EN] In {{order to}} look into the {{transmission}} process of the liver Digenea Dicrocoelium dendriticum (RUDOLPHI, 1819) LOOSS, 1899, in greater depth, studies of parasite behaviour in their intermediate (molluscs and ants) as well as their definitive hosts (lambs) were carried out. Some aspects of the parasite / host relationship were likewise studied. Studies carried out on ants We collected 1, 273 specimens of Formica rufibarbis at the tetanic stage between May and October. Of these 814 were dissected to obtain 48, 000 D. dendriticum metacercariae used to experimentally infect lambs. The rest of the collected ants were dissected and the metacercariae thus obtained were used as a basis for the morphological and isoenzymatic studies. The number of metacercariae harboured in the abdomen of each ant varied from 1 to 240 (x 59. 85 ± 1. 51). However, only one larva was found in the subesophagic ganglion. Metacercariae length varied between 336 and 460. 8 mm, width between 240 and 368. 8 mm and cyst wall between 9. 6 and 24 mm. Studies carried out on lambs Two groups of lambs were infected with the metacercariae obtained from the ants, one with a dose of 1, 000 and the other with 3, 000 metacercariae / lamb. Each of these groups, consisting of 12 four-month-old Churra breed lambs, together with 2 control groups (4 lambs in each) were kept isolated on <b>Agricultural</b> Research Station <b>premises.</b> Half the animals were slaughtered 2 months post-infection (p. i.), and the other half six months p. i. Faeces were collected from the animals' rectums from 1 _ months p. i. in order to detect D. dendriticum eggs and then follow their elimination. Fortnightly sampling {{early in the morning and}} in the late afternoon continued until the study ended. All the animals tested began D. dendriticum egg elimination between 49 and 79 days p. i., except one which did not eliminate until 2 months p. i. when it died. The eggs were 33. 32 mm - 45. 22 mm long and 21. 42 - 28. 56 mm wide. Highest eggs/gram (epg) elimination was observed in the afternoons. The number of epg eliminated by all the infected lambs varied between 33. 33 and 2, 266. 44 (x 274. 81 ± 23. 79) and that of lambs infected with 3, 000 metacercariae (966. 53 ± 147. 54 epg) was higher than that of those infected with 1, 000 (240. 11 ± 45. 69). In general the number of epg eliminated by lambs increased as days p. i. and parasite burden did. A relation (r = 0. 65) was also observed between the worms recovered from each lamb and the average number of epg eliminated throughout the experiment. That relation was intensified when only epg eliminated between 4 and 6 months p. i. were considered. In addition blood samples were taken from all the lambs at fortnightly intervals from day 0 p. i. to study enzymes and parameters as possible indicators of alterations in liver function. In general values of the hepatic marker enzymes (AST, ALT, LDH, ALP and GGT) and of leucocytes and leucocytic formula obtained from infected lambs differed from those of the control animals. Nevertheless, those of the biochemical parameters (total proteins, albumin, total bilirrubin and glucose) and the rest of the haematic ones (erythrocytes, haematocrit, haemoglobin, MCV, MCH and MCHC) did not alter.
