Disney studios take inspiration {{from some of the}} other studios such as Studio Ghibli and Madhouse because the production team feels that many of the Japan's studios <b>are</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> them and capable of making better animation, which is the reason why they get inspiration from what those studios produce.|$|E
25|$|Secured and {{unsecured}} creditors {{constitute the}} creditor body. Both secured and unsecured creditors <b>are</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> shareholders as noted earlier. A secured creditor is a creditor, {{who has a}} priority claim on an asset or assets of a company. A lien on the specific asset or assets places the secured creditor's claim ahead of the unsecured creditor. Once a secured creditor is satisfied, the unsecured creditor is then the next priority. This is again the normal order of priority in a bankruptcy.|$|E

500|$|After high school, {{he enlisted}} in the United States Air Force. Stone worked at the Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, California, as an intake clerk for {{children}} who needed to be treated, and trained at United States Forces Azores. Joao Santos, a trainer of Stone, {{said that he is}} [...] "a really nice guy, polite, well-educated and very keen on learning." [...] In October 2015, Stone was promoted to the rank of senior airman at Travis Air Force Base in California, partly in due to the bold acts in France. Following this promotion, Stone was promoted to the rank of staff sergeant, effective November 1, 2016, by the order of United States Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark A. Welsh III. Stone commented, saying [...] "It is an honor to be promoted to staff sergeant, and I am extremely thankful for the opportunity to lead my fellow Airmen,” and that “I am ready for the growth and challenges that <b>are</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> me." [...] Stone was promoted in part due to his role in stopping the 2015 Thalys train attack.|$|E
500|$|Speculation ignited that Ponting was an {{outsider}} {{to be selected}} for the Australian squad on their 1993 tour to England. Of the speculation, Ponting said [...] "At {{the start of the}} season I was wondering whether or not I'd play Shield cricket this year and all of a sudden there's talk in the papers that I'm a chance go on an Australian tour of England. I think it's way out of reach — there are blokes like [...] Jamie Siddons who have scored 20 or 30 first-class centuries who <b>are</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> me. Nevertheless, Shipperd thought Ponting could handle the experience: [...] "A lot of attention affects different people in different ways, but Ricky is such a well-rounded young fella that it hasn't changed him. I've told him to enjoy the all the attention and if he just keeps on being himself I'm sure he'll cope well with all the success that I imagine he will achieve." [...] The selectors eventually chose Western Australian batsman Damien Martyn for the tour, with Ponting selected in the Academy squad captained by Justin Langer, which toured India and Sri Lanka for seven games in August and September in 1993. Australian success was limited, with only a few wins. No batsman scored a century, but Ponting reached 99 not out in a one-day game in Colombo. He finished the tour second highest in the run-scorers behind Langer.|$|E

2500|$|An {{equilibrium}} tidal bulge {{does not}} really exist on Earth because the continents do not allow this mathematical solution to take place. Oceanic tides actually rotate around the ocean basins as vast gyres around several amphidromic points where no tide exists. The Moon pulls on each individual undulation as Earth rotates—some undulations <b>are</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the Moon, others are behind it, whereas still others are on either side. The [...] "bulges" [...] that actually do exist for the Moon to pull on (and which pull on the Moon) are the net result of integrating the actual undulations over all the world's oceans. Earth's net (or equivalent) equilibrium tide has an amplitude of only 3.23cm, which is totally swamped by oceanic tides that can exceed one metre.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} is a plywood covered wooden monocoque with an oval cross section; {{the wing}} is mounted {{at the highest}} point immediately behind the cockpit, which places instructor and pupil in side-by-side seats ahead of the leading edge, equipped with dual control and covered by a short, upward opening, rear hinged, multi-piece canopy. There is another pair of opening fuselage transparencies immediately below the canopy. [...] Behind the wing the fuselage tapers, initially quickly, to the tail where the narrow chord, round tipped tailplane is mounted, with some dihedral, on top of it. [...] The broader, split elevators <b>are</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> a straight edged, blunt tipped narrow fin and wide rudder. Like the wings, the empennage is wood framed and fabric covered.

2500|$|In Brazil, {{field trials}} of fast growing GM {{eucalyptus}} are currently underway, they {{are set to}} conclude in 2015-2016 with commercialization to result. FuturaGene, a biotechnology company owned by Suzano, a [...] Brazilian pulp and paper company, has been leading this research. [...] Stanley Hirsch, chief executive of FuturaGene has stated: [...] "Our trees grow faster and thicker. We <b>are</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> everyone. We have shown we can increase the yields and growth rates of trees more than anything grown by traditional breeding." [...] The company is looking to reduce harvest cycles from 7 to 5.5 years with 20-30% more mass than conventional eucalyptus. There is concern that such objectives may further exacerbate the negative impacts of plantation forestry. Increased water and soil nutrient demand from faster growing species may lead to irrecoverable losses in site productivity and further impinge upon neighbouring communities and ecosystems.|$|E

The BlackBerry Z10, the first BlackBerry smartphone running BlackBerry 10, debuted worldwide in January 2013, going on sale immediately in the U.K. {{with other countries}} following. A marked departure from previous BlackBerry phones, the Z10 featured a fully touch-based design, a dual-core processor, and a high-definition display. BlackBerry 10 had 70,000 applications available at launch, which the company expected would rise to 100,000 {{by the time the}} device made its debut in the United States. In support of the launch, the company aired its first Super Bowl television advertisement in the U.S. and Canada during Super Bowl XLVII. In discussing the decision to create a proprietary operating system instead of adopting an off-the-shelf platform such as Android, Heins noted, [...] "If you look at other suppliers' ability to differentiate, there's very little wiggle room. We looked at it seriouslybut if you understand what the promise of BlackBerry is to its user base it's all about getting stuff done. Games, media, we have to be good at it but we have to support those guys who <b>are</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the game. Very little time to consume and enjoy contentif you stay true to that purpose you have to build on that basis. And if we want to serve that segment we can't do it on a me-too approach."

The carriers are behind us. They don't want a duopoly" [...] (referring to Apple and Samsung).|$|E
