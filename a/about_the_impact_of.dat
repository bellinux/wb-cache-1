5|$|As a {{resident}} of Switzerland, Prince Sadruddin was concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> insensitive tourist development and deforestation on the European Alps. At the World Economic Forum in 1990, he launched Alp Action to protect the mountain ecosystem and preserve the Alps' cultural diversity and vitality. The Bellerive Foundation program encouraged eco-tourism, aiming to reduce the impact of outdoor adventure sports on the fragile alpine habitat. During its years of operation, Alp Action successfully launched over 140 projects in seven countries. It found inspiration in the system of national parks of the Canadian Rockies.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> spaceflight on living creatures {{at the time}} of Laika's mission, and the {{technology}} to de-orbit had not yet been developed, so Laika's survival was never expected. Some scientists believed humans would be unable to survive the launch or the conditions of outer space, so engineers viewed flights by animals as a necessary precursor to human missions. The experiment aimed to prove that a living passenger could survive being launched into orbit and endure a Micro-g environment, paving the way for human spaceflight and providing scientists with some of the first data on how living organisms react to spaceflight environments.|$|E
5|$|John Bevan {{had asked}} Newman Smith {{to retain the}} threat of a US {{invasion}} force beyond 28 June when the initial deception was supposed to have ended. Agent Rudloff sent messages on 10, 12 and 18 July referring to the Ironside force. In mid-July, the Allies began Operation Ferdinand, a cover deception for Operation Dragoon, the August 1944 invasion of southern France. The Ironside story was considered as an option in support of Ferdinand, but Noel Wild and Ops (B), the SHAEF deception planners were worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> a theoretical US invasion force on the continuing Fortitude deception. It was decided that a new story would be presented to the Germans, suggesting that the Allies intended to bolster French resistance in the south of the country. The operation went largely unnoticed and German interest in the Bordeaux region dissipated.|$|E

5|$|Shareholders in the LSWR were {{concerned}} {{at the impact}} the cemetery scheme {{would have on the}} normal operations of the railway. At a shareholders' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted. The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators, other than promising them the use of one train each day. Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes, arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service. Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train, and felt that it demeaned the dignity of the deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives.|$|E

40|$|Neoliberalism reduces everything, {{including}} {{social work}} practice and education, to commodities, subjecting them to market calculations that maximise exploitation and profit. Whilst <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> neoliberalism on {{social work practice}} are now well documented, this paper seeks to contribute to an emerging dialogue <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> neoliberalism on social work education. Social work education holds direct {{implications for social work}} as a discipline and the type of professional practice that is carried out in the field. The paper examines the implications of the neoliberal university for social work curriculum, pedagogy, research and academic educators, particularly with reference to the Australian context. In this paper we expand existing critiques <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> neoliberalism on social work education, and draw on our own and other educators’ experiences to highlight the scope for agency and resistance...|$|R

25|$|In 2006 {{research}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> {{sound emissions}} from wind turbines on nearby population, perceived infrasound {{has been associated}} to effects such as annoyance or fatigue, depending on its intensity, with little evidence supporting physiological effects of infrasound below the human perception threshold.

Other studies have also suggested associations between noise levels in turbines and self-reported sleep disturbances in the nearby population, while adding that the contribution of infrasound to this effect is still not fully understood.|$|E
