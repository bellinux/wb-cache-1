500|$|Stamper {{was born}} in New York City on November 10, 1883, and took up piano at age ten. At seventeen, he left school and became a pianist at a Coney Island dance hall {{for two years before}} {{becoming}} a [...] "song-plugger" [...] for publisher F. A. Mills. Stamper was twenty when he met singer Nora Bayes and her husband Jack Norworth becoming her accompanist and touring widely for the next four years. After Stamper left Bayes' employment, he resumed working as a song-plugger and vaudeville pianist. In 1910 he met Gene Buck, an artist who painted cover images for sheet music. The two started collaborating, with Buck providing lyrics for Stamper's melodies. Their first published songs were In the Cool of the Evening, Daddy Has <b>a</b> <b>Sweetheart</b> (and Mother Is Her Name) and Some Boy.|$|E
500|$|Designed by Tetsuya Nomura, Tifa was {{not present}} in early {{versions}} of Final Fantasy VII, as initially, the game was to have only three playable characters; the protagonist Cloud Strife, Aerith Gainsborough and Barret Wallace. However, during {{a phone call to}} project director Yoshinori Kitase, it was suggested that {{at some point in the}} game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura later joked that this was his idea, so as to enable him to introduce Tifa into the game. Regardless, the notion of having two concurrent heroines, and having the hero waver between them, was something Kitase liked, describing it as something new in the Final Fantasy series. Nomura describes Tifa's character in Advent Children as having several dimensions, calling her [...] "like a mother, <b>a</b> <b>sweetheart,</b> and a close ally in battle" [...] and [...] "remarkably strong, not only emotionally, but physically as well." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{proximity}} of trench lines {{made it easy}} for soldiers to shout greetings to each other, and this may have been the most common method of arranging informal truces during 1914. Men would frequently exchange news or greetings, helped by a common language; many German soldiers had lived in England, particularly London, and were familiar with the language and the culture. Several British soldiers recorded instances of Germans asking about news from the football leagues, while other conversations could be as banal as discussions of the weather or as plaintive as messages for <b>a</b> <b>sweetheart.</b> One unusual phenomenon that grew in intensity was music; in peaceful sectors, it was not uncommon for units to sing in the evenings, sometimes deliberately with an eye towards entertaining or gently taunting their opposite numbers. This shaded gently into more festive activity; in early December, Sir Edward Hulse of the Scots Guards wrote that he was planning to organise a concert party for Christmas Day, which would [...] "give the enemy every conceivable form of song in harmony" [...] in response to frequent choruses of Deutschland Über Alles.|$|E
500|$|With {{the death}} of Whitney Houston {{three days before the}} episode aired, a great deal of {{attention}} was given to Amber Riley's performance of Houston's hit during the episode, [...] "I Will Always Love You", and its unexpected function as a tribute to the singer. Reviews were glowing: Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "gorgeous, lush take" [...] that was [...] "definitely an episode highlight", and Bell described is as [...] "a beautiful cover", [...] "the perfect song for Mercedes to sing to Sam" [...] and a [...] "haunting performance". Flandez wrote that it was a [...] "heart-rending love song that becomes a homage of the 48-year-old fallen star", and [...] "brought goosebumps"; the shot near the end, [...] "of Mercedes dressed in <b>a</b> <b>sweetheart</b> gown, standing alone, reaching for the stars, was memorable". The Washington Post Jen Chaney said that [...] "Riley deserves a standing ovation", and that she sang the song with [...] "a power motivated by genuine emotions that tied in directly to her storyline"; the [...] "heartbreaking context of Houston's death ... immediately elevated this moment to the very best one of Glee entire third season." [...] In December 2012, TV Guide listed the rendition as one of Glee best performances.|$|E
2500|$|The five films Loos {{wrote for}} Fairbanks {{made him a}} star. When Fairbanks was offered <b>a</b> <b>sweetheart</b> deal with Famous Players-Lasky, he took the team of Emerson-Loos {{with him at the}} high income of $500 a week. During this time Loos, Fairbanks and Emerson collaborated well together, and Loos was getting as much {{publicity}} as either Lillian Gish or Pickford. Photoplay magazine labeled her [...] "The Soubrette of Satire". In 1918, Famous Players-Lasky offered the couple a four-picture deal in New York for more money than they had been making with the Fairbanks unit.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} rituals and beliefs {{associated}} with basil. The French sometimes call basil [...] "l'herbe royale" [...] ("royal herb"), while in Welsh {{it has the}} synonymous name [...] "brenhinllys". Jewish folklore suggests it adds strength while fasting. In Portugal, dwarf bush basil is traditionally presented in a pot, together with a poem and a paper carnation, to <b>a</b> <b>sweetheart,</b> on the religious holidays of Saint John and Saint Anthony. However, basil represented hatred in ancient Greece, and European lore sometimes claims that basil {{is a symbol of}} Satan. African legend claims that basil protects against scorpions, while the English botanist Culpeper cites one [...] "Hilarius, a French physician" [...] as affirming it as common knowledge that smelling basil too much would breed scorpions in the brain.|$|E
2500|$|Along with {{everything}} else she has missed out on, she wants <b>a</b> <b>sweetheart.</b> Speed Dennis (Frank McHugh), Ipswich's press agent, considers this a great idea. He thinks the man should be [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] (to appeal to the corn belt), while Herbert (Franklin Pangborn), Glory's dressmaker, insists he be under 25. Ipswich's secretary tells them that the [...] "purest Anglo-Saxons" [...] hail from the hills of Kentucky, so Glory picks a fan letter at random from those written by young Kentucky men and ends up with 23-year-old Jim Davey (Norman Foster). She likes the enclosed photo of him. Ipswich, Speed and Herbert want her to choose someone else, but when [...] "sob sister" [...] reporter Elmerada de Leon (ZaSu Pitts) comes to interview Glory, she spots the photo, {{so they have to}} play along.|$|E

They are Prince Pattanadid (a younger brother of the new king, Rama VI) and his cousin, Prince Kridsada (a {{grandson}} of Rama IV), nicknamed [...] "Chao P." [...] and [...] "Kri", respectively. Chao P is deeply in love with Kri's sister, Princess Chantrapa ("Ying Chan"), and wears an emerald ring she gave him as a present. They ask Kiyoaki if he has <b>a</b> <b>sweetheart</b> and he names Satoko, although he has just sent her a [...] "wildly insulting letter" [...] the day before, in which he claims falsely that he has recently visited a brothel {{for the first time}} and has lost all respect for women, including her. To save the situation, he telephones Satoko and makes her promise to burn any letter she receives from him.|$|E

2500|$|When {{he made a}} {{deal with}} Germany for a $125 million-dollar loan (almost $1.9 billion in today's currency) with the {{conditions}} that Germany sign the Young Plan and, of course, award him a match monopoly. (He already controlled 70% of German match production before the loan agreement.) When he signed the contract he had no idea where he would obtain the huge amount, however he was lucky. [...] Prime Minister Aristide Briand of France decided to repay before it was due a previous $75 million-dollar loan from Ivar. Incredibly, the French agreed to pay this sum by April 1930, just before Ivar's first payment to Germany was due. That payment gave Ivar enough cash to make his first installment. Either he had negotiated <b>a</b> <b>sweetheart</b> rescue deal with Prime Minister Briand, or he was incredibly lucky. He also made $5M (c. $75 million in today's currency) due to the way the loan to France was structured. (It had been discounted and although France received only $70 million it was obligated to pay back $75 million.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Lacey Burrows (Gabrielle Miller) {{took over}} the {{previously}} unnamed coffee shop in Dog River after her aunt's death and renamed it The Ruby in her honour. Originally from Toronto, Ontario, she is perpetually trying to fit into small-town life, with mixed, often disastrous, results. She is a terrible liar, quick to jump to conclusions, a poor winner, and thinks everybody has a crush on her, and frequently exhibits insecurity and regret about the path her life has taken. She has also expressed frustration at being unable to find [...] "a stable guy" [...] to date in Dog River. She considers herself <b>a</b> <b>sweetheart</b> and secretly believes that she alone of the town's women deserves the [...] "Woman of Distinction" [...] award (which she eventually wins). She is also very knowledgeable {{when it comes to}} hockey, coaching Dog River's hockey team, the Dog River Riverdogs. It is implied that she and Brent Leroy have feelings for each other, although neither will admit or act upon them. In season five Karen describes Lacey as [...] "too upbeat, overly fastidious, a little needysame old Lacey!". Her fashion sense trends toward the revealing. This was mocked in the episode [...] "Doc Small", in which she welcomes to Dog River Dr. Chris Garner, a doctor from an even smaller town, and she's shocked by Lacey's [...] "slutty" [...] top, which is actually one of her more conservative tops. After the series' end she opened a second Ruby in Wullerton, but the local health inspectors quickly shut it down. It was revealed in [...] that she and Brent entered into a romantic relationship three {{years after the end of}} the series.|$|E
