5|$|In investigative {{reports and}} dozens of interviews, both named and {{anonymous}} ex-members made numerous specific allegations of Adi Da forcing members to engage in psychologically, sexually, and physically abusive and humiliating behavior, as well as <b>accusing</b> <b>the</b> church of committing tax fraud. Others stated that they never witnessed or were involved in any such activities.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Black September, Abu Nidal began <b>accusing</b> <b>the</b> PLO of cowardice {{over his}} Voice of Palestine {{radio station in}} Iraq for having agreed to a ceasefire with Hussein. During Fatah's Third Congress in Damascus in 1971, Abu Nidal joined Palestinian activist and writer Naji Allush and Abu Daoud (leader of the Black September Organization {{responsible}} for the 1972 Munich Massacre), calling for greater democracy within Fatah and revenge against King Hussein.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{in all of}} {{the above}} examples, the Bulveristic fallacy can go the other way. <b>The</b> {{mathematician}} could <b>accuse</b> <b>the</b> literature professor of denying 2+2=4 just because she is a literature professor. <b>The</b> salesperson could <b>accuse</b> <b>the</b> car buyer of denying the car's good gas mileage simply because {{they do not want to}} buy the car. <b>The</b> doctor could <b>accuse</b> <b>the</b> patient of denying life after death because the patient is afraid of what the afterlife may bring.The pastor could <b>accuse</b> <b>the</b> poor parishioner of denying that God rewards people because the parishioner just doesn't want to pay the tithe. <b>The</b> sociologist could <b>accuse</b> <b>the</b> feminist of denying that women should be breeders because she is a woman. <b>The</b> atheist could <b>accuse</b> <b>the</b> theist of denying that sexual exploration is healthy because she is a theist. <b>The</b> panelist could <b>accuse</b> <b>the</b> feminist of denying sexism against men due to misandry.The capitalist could <b>accuse</b> <b>the</b> communist of being a bad economist because he is a communist. And so on.|$|R
50|$|Two of {{the killers}} {{who took part}} in both killings and had {{originally}} changed their testimony to <b>accuse</b> <b>the</b> Valdés Paiz brothers have <b>accused</b> <b>the</b> Public Ministry of Guatemala and the United Nations Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala of pressuring them to <b>accuse</b> <b>the</b> Valdés Paiz brothers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Turkish {{government}} <b>accused</b> <b>the</b> coup {{leaders of}} being {{linked to the}} Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and cleric who lives in Pennsylvania, United States. Erdoğan accuses Gülen of being behind the coup—a claim that Gülen denies—and <b>accused</b> <b>the</b> United States of harboring him. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan <b>accused</b> <b>the</b> head of United States Central Command, chief General Joseph Votel of [...] "siding with coup plotters," [...] (after Votel <b>accused</b> <b>the</b> Turkish government of arresting the Pentagon's contacts in Turkey).|$|R
5|$|<b>Accusing</b> <b>the</b> Song {{of violating}} the {{agreement}} and realizing {{the weakness of the}} Song, the Jin generals launched a second punitive campaign, again dividing their troops into two armies. Wanyan Zonghan, who had withdrawn from Taiyuan after the Kaifeng agreement and left a small force in charge of the siege, came back with his western army. Overwhelmed, Taiyuan fell in September 1126, after 260 days of siege. When the Song court received news of the fall of Taiyuan, the officials who had advocated defending the empire militarily fell from favor again and were replaced by counselors who favored appeasement. In mid December the two Jurchen armies converged on Kaifeng for the second time that year.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in ancient}} times these {{similarities}} were controversial. Non-Christians in the Roman Empire in the early centuries CE thought Christianity and the mystery cults resembled each other. Reacting to these claims by outsiders, early Christian apologists denied that these cults had influenced their religion. The 17th-century Protestant scholar Isaac Casaubon brought up the question again by <b>accusing</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church of deriving its sacraments from the rituals of the mystery cults. Charles-François Dupuis, in the late 18th century, went further by claiming that all Christianity originated in the mystery cults. Intensified by religious disputes between Protestants, Catholics, and non-Christians, the controversy has continued to the present day.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Weaver, {{now living}} in Dubbo, contested the seat of Ashburnham for the Liberal Party but was {{defeated}} on 46-53% against the Labor Party's John Lynch. Undeterred, Weaver stood again in 1913 as the Farmers and Settlers Party candidate for the seat of Macquarie but was narrowly defeated with 49.61% against the Labor Party candidate's 50.39%. Weaver contested the result, <b>accusing</b> <b>the</b> Labor Party of manipulating the rolls. An inquiry found no fault in these accusations against the Labor Party, but instead found Weaver's own organisers guilty of roll-stuffing.|$|E

50|$|Amnesty International has <b>accused</b> <b>the</b> Mauritania {{legal system}} of {{functioning}} {{with a complete}} disregard of legal procedure, fair trial, or humane imprisonment.

5|$|Many crash {{survivors}} suffered long recoveries {{from the}} physical and psychological traumas they endured. A month after the crash, an orderly caravan of around 1,000 vehicles drove to JFK while some demonstrators laid wreaths in the international terminal lobby to protest {{the handling of the}} flight. Some survivors sued the FAA, <b>accusing</b> <b>the</b> agency of failing to ensure the flight's safety. In July 1990, Avianca offered $75,000 to crash survivors and the relatives of those killed. The U.S. government eventually joined Avianca and reached a settlement estimated at over $200million in damages to the victims.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{both sides}} {{unleashed}} diplomatic offensives. The Knights dispatched {{letters to the}} monarchs of Europe, preaching their usual crusade against the heathens; Władysław countered with his own letters to the monarchs, <b>accusing</b> <b>the</b> Order of planning to conquer the whole world. Such appeals successfully recruited many foreign knights to each side. Wenceslas IV of Bohemia signed a defensive treaty with the Poles against the Teutonic Order; his brother, Sigismund of Luxembourg, allied himself with the Order and declared war against Poland on 12 July, though his Hungarian vassals refused his call to arms.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1941, Germany, {{supported}} by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, with Germany <b>accusing</b> <b>the</b> Soviets of plotting against them. They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary. The primary targets of this surprise offensive were the Baltic region, Moscow and Ukraine, {{with the ultimate}} goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line, from the Caspian to the White Seas. Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate Communism, generate Lebensraum ("living space") by dispossessing the native population and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals.|$|E
50|$|Both {{sides of}} <b>the</b> debate <b>accuse</b> <b>the</b> {{other side of}} {{deception}} and misleading the public. <b>The</b> pro-RH people <b>accuse</b> <b>the</b> anti-RH group of misleading the public by calling the bill an abortion bill, when the bill states that abortion remains a crime and is punishable. <b>The</b> anti-RH advocates <b>accuse</b> <b>the</b> RH supporters of hiding from the public the international population control agenda which includes abortion and they refer to U.S. Secretary Hillary Clinton who said that RH includes abortion.|$|R
50|$|In the 18th century, <b>the</b> Jesuits <b>accused</b> <b>the</b> Jansenists of {{affirming the}} radical Augustinian doctrines of Calvinism; the Jansenists, in turn, <b>accused</b> <b>the</b> Jesuits of semipelagianism. The 1713 papal bull of Pope Clement XI, Unigenitus, in declaring Jansenism heretical, upheld the Jesuits' objections.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} other {{criminal}} proceedings, it is optional for <b>the</b> <b>accused</b> to testify. If <b>the</b> <b>accused</b> does testify, he or she cannot be cross-examined on the offence before the court unless <b>the</b> <b>accused</b> testifies about <b>the</b> offence itself. This only applies to <b>the</b> offence <b>the</b> <b>accused</b> is charged with and not with other offences committed by <b>the</b> <b>accused.</b> <b>The</b> rule {{does not apply to}} any other witnesses in the hearing.|$|R
5|$|The first British Isles side (now {{known as}} the British and Irish Lions) toured New Zealand and Australia in 1888. The side was privately organised, without the {{sanction}} or prohibition of England's Rugby Football Union, and toured New Zealand in April and May that year where they played against a number of provincial sides. Although the team was not representative of the best British and Irish players, it did include three internationals with the rest predominantly county representatives. Warbrick was in the Wellington team that faced the tourists on 13 May. The match was ill-tempered, with each side <b>accusing</b> <b>the</b> other of rough play, and eventually finished as a 3–3 draw.|$|E
5|$|Unrest {{then broke}} out across eastern Bolivia, as radicalized autonomist activists {{established}} blockades, occupied airports, clashing with pro-government demonstrations, police, and armed forces. Some formed paramilitaries, bombing state companies, indigenous NGOs, {{and human rights}} organisations, also launching armed racist attacks on indigenous communities, culminating in the Pando Massacre of MAS activists. The autonomists gained support from some high-ranking politicians; Santa Cruz Governor Rubén Costas lambasted Morales and his supporters with racist epithets, <b>accusing</b> <b>the</b> president of being an Aymara fundamentalist and a totalitarian dictator responsible for state terrorism. Amid the unrest, foreign commentators began speculating {{on the possibility of}} civil war.|$|E
5|$|As Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party and Leader of the Opposition, Morton had {{to direct}} the {{campaign}} for the upcoming election in early 1956. At the official campaign launch on 15 February, Morton began by <b>accusing</b> <b>the</b> Cahill government of losing its way and wasting public funds, while promising to invest in public works, education and health. At the election on 3 March 1956, the Liberals gained five seats (Coogee, Drummoyne, Georges River, Parramatta and Sutherland) and the Country Party under Michael Bruxner regained the seat of Armidale, reducing the government's majority from twenty to six. Morton retained Mosman with 78.74%. Although the Coalition had failed to win government, an official report from the Liberal Party State Council blamed the defeat on the seat redistribution, the abolition of postal voting and the strong right-wing Labor support for Premier Cahill.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, Terrell {{represented}} Kumasi Simmons, {{a former}} football player from Centennial High School in Compton expelled for hitting a referee.

5|$|Belle has {{garnered}} widespread acclaim from {{film critics}} who appreciated the character's bravery, intelligence and independence. Reception towards her feminism, however, {{has been more}} mixed, with commentators <b>accusing</b> <b>the</b> character's actions of being romance-oriented. The fifth Disney Princess, Belle is often ranked among the franchise's best. Highly {{regarded as one of}} Disney's strongest examples of a feminist character, critics agree that Belle helped spearhead a generation of independent film heroines while changing the reputation of a Disney princess. Also one of Disney's most iconic characters, Belle was the only animated heroine nominated for the American Film Institute's greatest heroes in film ranking. The character also appears in the film's several sequels and spin-offs, as well as her own live-action television series. American actress Susan Egan originated the role of Belle in the Broadway musical adaptation of the film, for which she was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. Emma Watson plays a live-action version of the character in a 2017 live action adaptation of the original 1991 film.|$|E
5|$|Burchard was {{appointed}} as treasurer of York by King Richard I of England on 15 September 1189, but his appointment {{was at first}} opposed by the newly chosen Archbishop of York, Geoffrey. Along with Burchard, Richard also appointed Henry Marshal the dean; and Roger of London the abbot of Selby Abbey. Because of Geoffrey's objections, his estates were confiscated by the king until he submitted. Burchard and Marshal retaliated by <b>accusing</b> <b>the</b> archbishop-elect of being a murderer {{as well as the}} son of a prostitute. When Geoffrey visited York in October 1189, both Burchard and Marshal requested their installation in their offices, but Geoffrey refused to do so until he himself was confirmed in his archbishopric by the papacy. Geoffrey's refusal to install the royal nominees meant the archbishop-elect was out of favour with Richard, and the king refused to allow Geoffrey's officials to travel to Rome to request confirmation of the archbishopric.|$|E
5|$|Derek Fisher succeeded Ewing as NBPA {{president}} in 2006. In early 2011, negotiations {{on a new}} CBA began. The league claimed that it was losing $300 million a year (22 out of 30 teams were losing money last season) and proposed to reduce 40% of players' salary (about $800 million) and institute a hard salary cap (at $45 million per team) {{as opposed to a}} soft cap (at $58 million) currently in use. The union disputed those figures and steadfastly opposed those changes. Hunter said that he was advising players to prepare for a lockout. In May 2011, the NBPA {{filed a complaint with the}} National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), <b>accusing</b> <b>the</b> league of negotiating in bad faith by failing to provide critical financial data to the union and repeatedly threatening to lock out players. The NBA quickly rejected the complaint, saying that the league complies fully with federal labor laws. The union also considered the option of decertification, which allows players to file an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, the {{resultant}} debates led <b>the</b> Chalcedonians to <b>accuse</b> <b>the</b> non-Chalcedonians of teaching Christ's humanity {{to be of}} a different kind from our own. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> non-Chalcedonians <b>accused</b> <b>the</b> Chalcedonians of espousing a form of Nestorianism, a rejected doctrine that held that Jesus Christ was two distinct subsistences.|$|R

5|$|Here, Lenin revived his polemics {{against the}} Mensheviks, who objected to his {{advocacy}} of violent expropriations and thefts {{such as the}} 1907 Tiflis bank robbery, which the Bolsheviks were using to fund their activities. Lenin also became heavily critical of Bogdanov and his supporters; Bogdanov believed that a socialist-oriented culture had to be developed among Russia's proletariat for them to become a successful revolutionary vehicle, whereas Lenin favoured a vanguard of socialist intelligentsia who could lead the working-classes in revolution. Furthermore, Bogdanov– influenced by Ernest Mach– believed that all concepts of the world were relative, whereas Lenin stuck to the orthodox Marxist view {{that there was an}} objective reality to the world, independent of human observation. Although Bogdanov and Lenin went on a holiday together to Gorky's villa in Capri, Italy, in April 1908, on returning to Paris, Lenin encouraged a split within the Bolshevik faction between his and Bogdanov's followers, <b>accusing</b> <b>the</b> latter of deviating from Marxism.|$|E
5|$|Holby City has {{attracted}} comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within {{the television and}} entertainment industry including Broadcasting Standards Commission director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television licence fee on the programme. The series employs {{a team of researchers}} to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. Holby City has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the British Medical Association denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an accident and emergency nurse at the 2008 Royal College of Nursing conference <b>accusing</b> <b>the</b> show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.|$|E
5|$|In July 2000 it was {{announced}} that Punch magazine was to be prosecuted for contempt of court after publishing an article by former MI5 agent David Shayler. Shayler's article claimed MI5 could have stopped the Bishopsgate bombing, which a spokesman for Attorney General Lord Williams claimed was a breach of a 1997 court injunction preventing Shayler disclosing information on security or intelligence matters. In November 2000 Punch and its editor were found guilty and fined £20,000 and £5,000 respectively. In March 2001 the editor successfully appealed against his conviction and fine, with an appeal judge <b>accusing</b> <b>the</b> Attorney General of acting like a press censor and ruling that the 1997 injunction was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. In December 2002 this decision was overturned at the House of Lords, with five law lords ruling that editor James Steen's publication of Shayler's article was indeed in contempt.|$|E
50|$|Tensions {{had risen}} between the Flemish and <b>the</b> Walloons: Flanders <b>accuses</b> <b>the</b> Walloon region of being {{dependent}} on economic subsidies from the Flemish region; {{there is also}} reluctance by the Walloons to learn Dutch. <b>The</b> Walloon population <b>accuses</b> <b>the</b> Flemish of being segregationist with the language policy in the Flemish region.|$|R
