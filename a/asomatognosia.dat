5000|$|Anosognosia ( [...] , from Ancient Greek ἀ- a-, [...] "without", νόσος nosos, [...] "disease" [...] and γνῶσις gnōsis, [...] "knowledge") is {{a deficit}} of self-awareness, a {{condition}} in which a person with some disability seems unaware of its existence. It was first named by the neurologist Joseph Babinski in 1914. Anosognosia results from physiological damage to brain structures, typically to the parietal lobe or a diffuse lesion on the fronto-temporal-parietal area in the right hemisphere, and is thus a neurological disorder. While this distinguishes the condition from denial, which is a psychological defense mechanism, attempts have been made at a unified explanation. Anosognosia is sometimes accompanied by <b>asomatognosia,</b> a form of neglect in which patients deny ownership of their limbs.|$|E
40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{relation}} between anosognosia for hemiplegia and confabulation, 11 patients with acute right cerebral infarctions and left upper limb hemiparesis were assessed for anosognosia for hemiplegia, illusory limb movements (ILMs), hemispatial neglect, <b>asomatognosia,</b> and cognitive impairment. Five of 11 patients had unequivocal confabulation as evidenced by ILMs. The presence of ILMs {{was associated with the}} degree of anosognosia (p= 0. 002), with hemispatial neglect (p< 0. 05), and with <b>asomatognosia</b> (p< 0. 01). The results confirm that a strong relation exists between anosognosia for hemiplegia and confabulations concerning the movement of the plegic limb. There is also a strong relation between ILMs and <b>asomatognosia.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The {{patient with}} Capgras’ {{syndrome}} claims that people very familiar to him {{have been replaced}} by impostors. I argue that this disorder is due to the destruction of a representation that the patient has of the mind of the familiar person. This creates the appearance of a familiar body and face, but without the familiar personality, beliefs, and thoughts. The posterior site of damage in Capgras’ is often reported to be the temporoparietal junction, an area that has a role in the mindreading system, a connected system of cortical areas that allow us to attribute mental states to others. Just as the Capgras’ patient claims that that man is not his father, the patient with <b>asomatognosia</b> claims that his arm is not really his. A similar account applies here, in that a nearby brain area, the supramarginal gyrus, is damaged. This area works in concert with the temporoparietal junction and other areas to produce a large representation of a mind inside a body situated in an environment. Damage to the mind-representing part of this system (coupled with damage to executive processes in the prefrontal lobes) causes Capgras’ syndrome, whereas damage to the body-representing part of this system (also coupled with executive damage) causes <b>asomatognosia...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{feeling of}} "body ownership" may be {{experimentally}} investigated by perceptual illusions. The "rubber hand illusion" (RHI) leads human subjects to experience an artificial hand as their own. According to functional imaging, the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) {{plays a key}} role in the integration of multisensory inputs allowing the "incorporation" of the rubber hand into body representation. However, causal structure-function relationships can only be obtained by lesion studies. Here, we tested the RHI in 70 stroke patients and in 40 age-matched healthy controls. Additionally, <b>asomatognosia,</b> the unawareness of one's own body parts, was assessed in a subgroup of 64 stroke patients. Ischemic lesions were delineated on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images and normalized. Right-hemispheric lesions were mirrored across the midline. Voxels that might be essential for RHI and/or somatognosia were defined by voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. Probabilistic diffusion tractography was used to identify tracts passing through these voxels. Contralesional rubber hand illusion failure (RHIF) was observed in 18 (26 %) of 70 stroke patients, an additional ipsilesional RHIF in seven of these patients. RHIF-associated lesion voxels were located subcortically adjacent to the insula, basal ganglia, and within the periventricular white matter. Tractography revealed fiber tract connections of these voxels with premotor, parietal, and prefrontal cortex. Contralesional <b>asomatognosia</b> was found in 18 (28 %) of 64 stroke patients. In contrast to RHIF, asomatognosia-associated lesion voxels showed no connection with PMv. The results point to a role of PMv and its connections in mediating changes in the sense of limb ownership driven by multisensory stimulation...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{review article}} {{summarizes}} neuropsychological descriptions of abnormal body representations in brain-damaged patients and recent neuroscientific investigations of their sensorimotor underpinnings in healthy participants. The {{first part of}} the article describes unilateral disorders of the bodily self, such as <b>asomatognosia,</b> feelings of amputation, supernumerary phantom limbs and somatoparaphrenia, as well as descriptions of non-lateralized disorders of the bodily self, including Alice in Wonderland syndrome and autoscopic hallucinations. Because the sensorimotor mechanisms of these disorders are unclear, we focus on clinical descriptions and insist on the importance of reporting clinical cases to better understand the full range of bodily disorders encountered in neurological diseases. The second part of the article presents the advantages of merging neuroscientific approaches of the bodily self with immersive virtual reality, robotics and neuroprosthetics to foster the understanding of the multisensory, motor and neural mechanisms of bodily representations...|$|E
40|$|Caloric {{stimulation}} induced {{a transient}} reversal of multimodal hemispatial cognitive deficits in an 81 -year-old {{woman with an}} acute left cerebral hemisphere stroke. The patient had unawareness of her right hand (<b>asomatognosia),</b> right-sided visual unawareness (hemineglect), aphasia and right-sided weakness (hemiplegia) prior to the stimulation. Transient improvements in impaired sensory, motor, linguistic and cognitive function developed within 30 s following application of the caloric stimulus and onset of horizontal nystagmus. The effect persisted for 3 min and ceased completely after 5 min. While several recent reports have described the capacity of caloric stimulation to transiently improve or reverse {{a wide range of}} attentional, cognitive and motor impairments, most examples are in right-hemisphere-damaged patients with long-standing brain injury. Typically, patients have been tested several months or years after the onset of the deficit.

40|$|Misoplegia: {{a review}} of the {{literature}} and a case without hemiplegia Brain damage may cause profound changes in people’s attitudes towards their own bodies. Relatively common after unilateral lesions are anosognosia and anosodia-phoria—that is, the denial of, or unconcern about, a sensorimotor hemisyndrome. Less familiar forms of altered limb perception include <b>asomatognosia</b> (lack of awareness of a part of the body), somatoparaphrenia (lack of ownership of a paralysed limb), the experience of supernumerary phantom limbs (reduplication of limbs on the affected side of the body), personification (nicknaming a limb and giving it an identity of its own) and misoplegia. The term misoplegia was coined by Critchley 1 2 and refers to the morbid dislike or hatred of paralysed limbs in patients with hemiplegia. Minor manifestations of this condition may be restricted to verbal aggression towards a limb, but commonly misoplegia includes physical acts such as striking and beating the hemiplegic extremity. 1 – 3 Although these verbal or physical acts of self-directed aggression are impressive, detailed case reports are rare. Apart from the anecdotal commu-nications by Critchley 1 2 and some passing notes by others, we are aware of only six published accounts. These cases and our new observation are summarised in the supplemen-tary data available online a...|$|E
40|$|Anosognosia of {{hemiplegia}} is {{of interest}} for both pragmatic and theoretical reasons. We discuss several neuropsychological theories that have been proposed to explain this de¢cit. Although for psychological reasons people might deny de¢cits, the denial hypothesis cannot account for the hemispheric asymmetries associated with this disorder and cannot explain why some patients might deny one de¢cit and recognize another equally disabling de¢cit. There {{is some evidence that}} faulty feedback from sensory de¢cits, spatial neglect and <b>asomatognosia</b> might be responsible for anosognosia in some patients. However, these feed-back hypotheses cannot account for anosognosia in all patients. Although the hemispheric disconnection hypothesis is appealing, disconnection is probably only a rare cause of this disorder. The feedforward intentional theory of anosognosia suggests that the discovery of weakness is dependent on attempted action and some patients might have anosognosia because they do not attempt to move. We present evidence that supports this theory. The presence of one mechanism of anosognosia, however, does not preclude the possibility that other mechanisms might also be working to produce this disorder. Although a large population study needs to be performed, we suspect that anosognosia might be caused by several of the mechanisms that we have discussed. On the basis of the studies of impaired corporeal self-awareness that we have reviewed, we can infe...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Depersonalisation (DP) and derealisation (DR) {{are often}} met with in {{patients}} {{with a wide range}} of localisable neurological conditions. This suggests that the "lesion method" might be a valid approach to study the neurobiology of DP/DR. However, the fact that anxiety can trigger DP/DR makes it difficult to establish whether the presence of DP/DR in neurological patients is mainly determined by coexisting anxiety or by lesion location. To overcome this difficulty, we suggest the study of neurological phenomena, which although not considered as DP/DR, bear enough phenomenological resemblance with them as to warrant their use as models. METHODS: One patient with "visual hypoemotionality" and another with "hemiasomatognosia" are described in detail together with a selective literature review. RESULTS: Complaints of patients with visual hypoemotionality are indistinguishable from those of patients with "visual derealisation". There is also a phenomenological overlap between "asomatognosia" and the symptom of "body alienation", which is a central feature of depersonalisation. CONCLUSIONS: Phenomenological similarities between visual hypoemotionality and DR suggest that a disruption of the process by means of which perception becomes emotionally coloured may be an underlying mechanism in both conditions. Likewise, phenomenological overlaps with <b>asomatognosia</b> suggest that DP might result from parietal mechanisms disrupting the experience of body ownership and agency. These findings give validity to the notion that DP and DR may have distinct neurobiological mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Reports of able-bodied {{participants}} with the persisting desire for limb amputation raise {{legal and ethical}} questions that are partly due to insufficient empirical knowledge about the condition. Here, we searched for potential neurological mechanisms in {{participants with}} desire for limb amputation {{in order to help}} develop adequate nosological classifications, diagnosis, and treatment. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 20 participants who self-identified themselves as able-bodied individuals desiring amputation of a limb. RESULTS: The results suggest that amputation desire is not unspecific, but in most cases specific for a circumscribed part of the body. Most frequently affected was the leg, mostly on the left, non-dominant side. Left-sidedness and limb specificity was associated with elementary and complex somatosensory disturbances of the affected limb akin to those reported by neurological patients. The most frequent neurological co-morbidity was migraine headache. CONCLUSIONS: These results document the existence of an unusual condition in able-bodied participants characterized by a person's desire for the amputation of one or more particular limbs. Left-sidedness, limb specificity and somatosensory disturbances of the affected limb are suggestive of abnormal brain mechanisms in right fronto-parietal cortex. Based on this association we suggest that desire for limb amputation may be conceptualized as <b>asomatognosia</b> due to disturbed integration of multi-sensory information of the affected body parts into a coherent cerebral representation of the own body. This suggestion has to be regarded with caution as we did not perform any neurological examination...|$|E
