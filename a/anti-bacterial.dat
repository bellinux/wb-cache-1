40|$|Apicomplexans are obligate {{intracellular}} parasites causing devastating {{disease in}} both humans and livestock. Nearly all apicomplexans, {{with the exception}} of Cryptosporidium, contain two endosymbiontic organelles carrying their own DNA; the mitochondrion and the plastid-like organelle called the apicoplast. The apicoplast is an attractive drug target as it harbors not only metabolic pathways not found in the host cell, but it is also dependent on its ancient transcriptional and translational machinery. These parasites rely on the plastid, and inhibition of its function or loss of this organelle leads to immediate or delayed death. Replication of plastidic DNA shows differences between the members of this phylum. In Plasmodium parasites, two forms of replication are observed [...] unidirectional single-stranded replication and a rolling circle mechanism [...] whereas in Toxoplasma gondii only the rolling circle is found. Targeting enzymes involved in DNA-replication leads to a delayed death of the parasite. Most of the genes in the apicoplast genome encode elements of their own transcriptional and translational machinery, and they are highly similar to those found in bacteria.

Procedures. Gastric Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection was assessed with a MetAtron diagnostic monitor (IPP). Volunteers attending a naturopathic clinic took oral treatments with either dried KP extract (1 gm b. i. d.) or CMS (≤ 0. 3 mg Ag b. i. d.) Lunasol™ for five days only. Probability indices for HP infection were determined on days zero, 7, 14 and 28 to assess a) efficacy and b) duration of response post-treatment. [Protocols for clinical studies were approved by an appropriate Human Ethics Committee. ] Results: KP extract effectively reduced gastric HP burden > 85 % within one week. The KP was particularly valuable as second-line treatment in a few subjects (3 / 17) showing lesser responses (≤ 40 %) to CMS alone. Conclusion: At present, supply constraints and significant harvesting costs may limit the usefulness of KP as a pytotherapy to treat gastric inflammation/ulcers associated with HP. Nevertheless it is a valuable synergist for tandem therapy with other traditional remedies for ulcer disease eg Bismuth, licorice (2).

Therefore, understanding the underlying factors that contribute to bacteria-biomaterial interactions are of utmost importance for researchers and health care professionals who develop biomaterials and new <b>anti-bacterials.</b> In this context, the aim of this thesis was to evaluate the role of adhesion forces in the response of bacteria to their adhering state. To this end, we used a model pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, common in biomaterial associated infections and several of its isogenic mutants and applied Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Surface Enhanced Fluorescence (SEF) to quantify adhesion forces and cell wall deformation, respectively. Bacterial response was evaluated in terms of gene expression on different biomaterials commonly used in orthopedic implants. Our findings show that S. aureus experiences adhesion forces in the range 1. 0 – 5. 0 nN on the three biomaterials Stainless Steel (SS), Poly-Methylmethacrylate (PMMA) and Polyethylene (PE) and provide proof of concept that adhesion forces induce cell wall deformation upon adhesion to SS using SEF. At the molecular level we show that, as adhesion forces increase between the bacteria and the substratum, icaA gene expression and the expression of matrix components (Poly-N-acethyglocosamine and eDNA) decreases, suggesting a direct impact of adhesion forces on gene expression. Furthermore, presence of chemical stress nisin (antibiotic) in combination with mechanical stress (adhesion forces), increases the expression of the two-component system nisin-associated-sensitivity-response-regulator (NsaRS) and its downstream transporter NsaAB involved in pumping out nisin.

Information on the use of drugs during pregnancy is not available in Pakistan. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the patterns of drug prescriptions to pregnant women in tertiary care hospitals of Pakistan. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted at five tertiary care hospitals of Pakistan. Copies of outpatient medicinal prescriptions given to pregnant patients attending the antenatal clinics were collected. The drugs were classified according to the pharmacological class and their teratogenic potential. Results All the pregnant women attending the antenatal clinics received a prescription containing at least one drug. A total of 3769 distinct prescriptions given to different women were collected. Majority of the women who received the prescriptions belonged to third trimester (55. 4 %) followed by second (33. 6 %) and first trimester (11. 0 %). On an average, each prescription contained 1. 66 ± 0. 14 drugs. The obstetricians at Civil Hospital, Karachi and Chandka Medical College Hospital, Larkana showed a tendency of prescribing lesser number of drugs compared to those in other hospitals. Anti-anemic drugs including iron preparations and vitamin and mineral supplements (79. 4 %) were the most frequently prescribed drugs followed by analgesics (6. 2 %) and <b>anti-bacterials</b> (2. 2 %). 739 women (19. 6 %) received prescriptions containing drugs other than vitamin or mineral supplements. Only 1275 (21. 6 %) of all the prescribed drugs (n = 6100) were outside this vitamin/mineral supplement class. Out of these 1275 drugs, 29 (2. 3 %) drugs were prescribed which are considered to be teratogenic. Misoprostol was the most frequently prescribed (n = 6) among the teratogenic drugs followed by carbimazole (n = 5) and methotrexate (n = 5). Twenty nine pregnant women (0. 8 % of all the women studied) were prescribed these teratogenic drugs.

METHODS: A 3 -year prospective study on medication errors reported to the NPIC was conducted from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009 inclusive. Data on patient demographics, enquiry source, location, pharmaceutical agent(s), type of medication error, and treatment advice were collated from standardised call report forms. Medication errors were categorised as (i) prescribing error (i. e. physician error), (ii) dispensing error (i. e. pharmacy error), and (iii) administration error involving the wrong medication, the wrong dose, wrong route, or the wrong time. RESULTS: Medication errors were reported for 2348 individuals, representing 9. 56 % of total enquiries to the NPIC over 3 years. In total, 1220 children and adolescents under 18 years of age and 1128 adults (>/= 18 years old) experienced a medication error. The majority of enquiries were received from healthcare professionals, but members of the public accounted for 31. 3 % (n = 736) of enquiries. Most medication errors occurred in a domestic setting (n = 2135), but a small number occurred in healthcare facilities: nursing homes (n = 110, 4. 68 %), hospitals (n = 53, 2. 26 %), and general practitioner surgeries (n = 32, 1. 36 %). In children, medication errors with non-prescription pharmaceuticals predominated (n = 722) and anti-pyretics and non-opioid analgesics, <b>anti-bacterials,</b> and cough and cold preparations were the main pharmaceutical classes involved. Medication errors with prescription medication predominated for adults (n = 866) and the major medication classes included anti-pyretics and non-opioid analgesics, psychoanaleptics, and psychleptic agents. Approximately 97 % (n = 2279) of medication errors were as a result of drug administration errors (comprising a double dose [n = 1040], wrong dose [n = 395], wrong medication [n = 597], wrong route [n = 133], and wrong time [n = 110]). Prescribing and dispensing errors accounted for 0. 68 % (n = 16) and 2. 26 % (n = 53) of errors, respectively. CONCLUSION: Empirical data from poisons information centres facilitate the characterisation of medication errors occurring in the community and across the healthcare spectrum. Poison centre data facilitate the detection of subtle trends in medication errors and can contribute to pharmacovigilance. Collaboration between pharmaceutical manufacturers, consumers, medical, and regulatory communities is needed to advance patient safety and reduce medication errors...|$|R
