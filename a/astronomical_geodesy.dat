50|$|Satellite geodesy is geodesy {{by means}} of {{artificial}} satellites — the measurement of the form and dimensions of Earth, the location of objects on its surface and {{the figure of the}} Earth's gravity field {{by means of}} artificial satellite techniques. It belongs to the broader field of space geodesy. Traditional <b>astronomical</b> <b>geodesy</b> is not commonly considered a part of satellite geodesy, although there is considerable overlap between the techniques.|$|E
40|$|Transformation {{procedures}} {{belong to}} the main tasks of surveyor working {{in a field of}} geodesy, for example in satellite geodesy or <b>astronomical</b> <b>geodesy.</b> It is necessary to know transformation procedures in 3 D terrestrial (Earth) coordinate systems. Increasingly a dynamic advance growth of application of satellite navigation systems, for example GPS (Global Positioning System) into engineering surveying, real estate register and others spheres of applied geodesy and geo-surveying (mine surveying) exacts knowledge of these transformation procedures between coordinates in various coordinate systems. These tasks are common for daily work for various practical surveyors too, not only for theoretical scientific working surveyors. Conventional Terrestrial System is 3 D coordinate system what is the most important coordinate system in global geodesy. Conventional Terrestrial System is an approximation of the nature coordinate system of the Earth. The origin of this coordinate system is placed in the earth substantial centre of gravity and in the centre of geoid. Conventional Terrestrial System is the Cartesian right-handed coordinate system, i. e. positive one. The Local Astronomical System is 3 D coordinate system too and it belongs to an important coordinate system in geodesy from its practical point of view. Many geodetic measurements are realized in this coordinate system. Designation of this coordinate system as astronomical system expresses its sticking to a normal line to an equipotential plane, i. e. to a vertical. Local Astronomical system is the left-handed cartesian coordinate system. Transformation procedures in 3 D terrestrial coordinate systems with theory of these systems are presented in the paper. Transformation in the local astronomical coordinate system presents common transformation in a frame of an adjustment of various local geodetic networks. In a case of satellite measurements (GPS, satellite altimetry, etc.) transformation between local and conventional terrestrial coordinate systems are necessary for national grid.

His work included development of Earth's gravity field models by the method of [...] "Potential der einfachen Schicht" [...] (single density layer). From 1970-1978 he was an applied Professor at Institut für Theoretische Geodäsie, University of Bonn and conducted lectures in <b>astronomical</b> and physical <b>geodesy,</b> including geoid determination by satellite geodesy and DTMs.|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{evolution}} of the concept of borders between human groups and with its slow evolution from the initial no men’s land zones to the ideal single-dimension linear borders. In ancient times the first borders were natural, such as mountain ranges or large rivers until, with the development of <b>Geodesy,</b> <b>astronomical</b> borders based on meridians and parallels became a favourite natural base. Actually, Modern States adopted these to fix limits in unknown conquered territories. The postmodern thought led give more importance to cultural borders until, in the most recent times, is becoming rather impossible to fix borders in the virtual cyberspace...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} VLBI arrays located in Europe, Canada, the United States, Russia, Korea, Japan, Mexico and Australia. The most {{sensitive}} VLBI array {{in the world}} is the European VLBI Network (EVN). This is a part-time array which brings together the largest European radiotelescopes for typically week-long sessions, with the data being processed at the Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe (JIVE). The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) uses ten dedicated, 25-meter telescopes spanning 5351 miles across the United States, and is the largest VLBI array that operates all year round as both an <b>astronomical</b> and <b>geodesy</b> instrument. The combination of the EVN and VLBA is known as Global VLBI. When one or both of these arrays are combined with one or more space-based VLBI antennas such as HALCA (previously) and now with RadioAstron (Spektr-R), the resolution obtained is higher than any other astronomical instrument, capable of imaging the sky with a level of detail measured in microarcseconds. VLBI generally benefits from the longer baselines afforded by international collaboration, with a notable early example in 1976, when radio telescopes in the United States, USSR and Australia were linked to observe hydroxyl-maser sources.|$|R
40|$|With the {{availability}} of Galileo signals from four in-orbit validation (IOV) satellites, positioning with Galileo-only observations has become possible, which allows us to assess its positioning performance. The performance of the Galileo system is evaluated in respect of carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N 0), pseudorange multipath (including noise), Galileo broadcast satellite orbit and satellite clock errors, and single point positioning (SPP) accuracy in Galileo-only mode {{as well as in}} GPS/Galileo combined mode. The precision of the broadcast ephemeris data is assessed using the precise satellite orbit and clock products from the Institute of <b>Astronomical</b> and Physical <b>Geodesy</b> of the Technische Universität München (IAPG/TUM) as references. The GPS-Galileo time offset (GGTO) is estimated using datasets from different types of GNSS receivers and the results indicate that a systematic bias exists between different receiver types. Positioning solutions indicate that Galileo-only SPP can achieve a three-dimensional position accuracy of about six metres. The integration of Galileo and GPS data can improve the positioning accuracies by about 10 % in the vertical components compared with GPS-only solutions.

40|$|Near {{real-time}} {{high resolution}} and high precision ionosphere models {{are used for}} {{a large number of}} applications e. g. in navigation, positioning, telecommunications or astronautics. Today these ionosphere models are mostly empirical, i. e. based purely on mathematical approaches. However, the complex phenomena within the ionosphere can only be detected under the consideration of the physical context. In this paper we present the basic structure of a model for the electron density of the ionosphere, which will be developed by a cooperation of DGFI Munich, the Institute of <b>Astronomical</b> and Physical <b>Geodesy</b> (IAPG) of the Technical University Munich (TUM) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Neustrelitz. This model will be based on series expansions in terms of physics-motivated mathematical functions such as the Chapman function. Based on the expertise of the three project partners on effective modelling, the new ionosphere model will be characterized by a quality satisfying the high demands of the users. For testing the procedure the model will be applied to an appropriate region in South America, which covers relevant ionospheric processes ans phenomena such as the Equatorial Anomaly. The main features of the project are (1) the consideration of physics-motivated modelling approaches, which are introduced in the multi-dimensional ionosphere model by means of appropriate mathematical base functions, (2) the estimation of the model parameters from the combination of various space-geodetic techniques, such as terrestrial and space-based GPS observations, altimetry and/or VLBI as well as (3) the transformation of the results into a multi-scale representation. The latter step allows both an effective data compression necessary for handling the huge ionosphere data sets and near real-time applications. ...|$|R
