5|$|The National Cancer Institute {{estimated}} 22,070 {{new cases}} of primary brain cancer and 12,920 deaths due to the illness in the United State in 2009. The age-adjusted incidence rate is 6.4 per 100,000 per year, and the death rate is 4.3 per 100,000 per year. The lifetime risk of developing brain cancer for someone born today is 0.60%. Only around <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> diagnosed with brain cancer survive for five years after diagnosis. These high overall mortality rates {{are a result of}} the prevalence of aggressive types, such as glioblastoma multiforme. Nearly 14% of new brain tumor diagnoses occur in persons under 20 years of age.|$|E
5|$|The battle caused heavy {{casualties}} {{for both}} sides. By {{the end of}} the fight, the NK 4th Division had only 300 or 400 men in each of its regiments. Of its original 7,000 men, the division now had a strength of only 3,500, having suffered over 1,200 killed. Several thousand members of the division deserted during the fight. Most of these men were South Korean civilians forcibly conscripted into the North Korean army. The NK 4th Division would not recover until much later in the war. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade reported 66 Marines dead, 278 wounded, and one missing. In total, American forces suffered around 1,800 casualties during the battle, with about <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> killed.|$|E
5|$|Less than <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> aboard Titanic {{survived the}} disaster. Some {{survivors}} died shortly afterwards; injuries {{and the effects}} of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard Carpathia. Of the groups shown in the table, 49% of the children, 26% of the female passengers, 82% of the male passengers and 78% of the crew died. The figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard Titanic, especially among women and children. Although less than 10percent of first- and second-class women (combined) were lost, 54% of those in third class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third class perished. The only first-class child to perish was Loraine Allison, aged 2. Proportionately, the heaviest losses were suffered by the second-class men, of whom 92% died. Additionally, among the pets brought aboard, three survived the sinking.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{remarkable}} variety of wildlife living at Dungeness, with over 600 different types <b>of</b> plant: <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> all <b>those</b> found in Britain.

5|$|The {{economy of}} Aarhus is {{predominantly}} knowledge and service based, {{strongly influenced by}} the University of Aarhus and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position on the rail network. Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality. The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 {{in the private sector}} and the rest split between state, region and municipality. The region is a major agricultural producer, with many large farms in the outlying districts. People commute to Aarhus {{from as far away as}} Randers, Silkeborg and Skanderborg and almost <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> employed within Aarhus municipality commute from neighbouring communities. Aarhus is a centre for retail in the Nordic and Baltic countries with expansive shopping centres, the busiest commercial street in the country and a dense urban core with many speciality shops.|$|E

25|$|Reye {{syndrome}} is a rapidly progressive encephalopathy. Symptoms may include vomiting, personality changes, confusion, seizures, {{and loss of}} consciousness. Even though liver toxicity typically occurs, yellowish skin usually does not. Death occurs in 20–40% of those affected and about <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who survive are left with a significant degree of brain damage.|$|E
40|$|Despite some {{controversy}} in recent years, {{the majority of}} experts agree on the evidence for effectiveness of breast screening by mammography for women aged 50 years and above, but for those under 50 years, the picture is much less clear. However, the issue remains of importance both to policy makers and to individual women; although the incidence of breast cancer is lower at younger ages, the life years lost due to cancers diagnosed below 50 years amount to <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> all <b>those</b> lost due to the disease...|$|R
5000|$|Triads (or {{any other}} tertian chords) are built by {{superimposing}} every other note of a diatonic scale (e.g., standard major or minor scale).

60|$|It was, I conceive, {{upon these}} motives, that the {{treasurer}} advised Her Majesty to create twelve new lords,[64] and thereby disable {{the sting of}} faction {{for the rest of}} her lifetime: this promotion was so ordered, that <b>a</b> <b>third</b> part were <b>of</b> <b>those</b> on whom, or their posterity, the peerage would naturally devolve; and the rest were such, whose merit, birth, and fortune, could admit of no exception.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} {{interrogate}} the accused, the Inquisition {{made use of}} torture, {{but not in a}} systematic way. It was applied mainly against those suspected of Judaism and Protestantism, beginning in the 16th century. For example, Lea estimates that between 1575 and 1610 the court of Toledo tortured approximately <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> processed for heresy. In other periods, the proportions varied remarkably. Torture was always a means to obtain the confession of the accused, not a punishment itself. Torture was also applied without distinction of sex or age, including children and the aged.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, the Danish rider Knud Enemark Jensen {{collapsed}} {{during the}} 100km team time trial at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome and died later in hospital. The autopsy showed {{he had taken}} amphetamine and another drug, Ronicol, which dilates the blood vessels. Pierre Dumas then led a committee of doctors demanding tests at the following Games. A national anti-doping law entered French legislation in June 1965. Performance-enhancing drugs were now illegal in France, and the first anti-doping testing began at the 1966 Tour. That year, amphetamine use in France was running at almost <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> tested.|$|E
25|$|The next 6 seasons {{were very}} successful, winning ten or more games in 5 of the 6 and sharing the conference {{championship}} in three. Eddie George won the Heisman Trophy in 1995 after a tremendous senior season, Ohio State defeated Notre Dame in 1995 and 1996, and won half its bowl games. But in three seasons (1993, 1995, and 1996) the Buckeyes entered the Michigan game undefeated, {{with the possibility}} of a national championship in at least one, and lost all three to underdog Wolverine teams. Ohio State had won 62 games and lost only 12, but <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> were to Michigan.|$|E

New catchment areas were implemented by Buckinghamshire Local Education Authority in 2004 so that selected pupils may now attend The Royal Grammar School (boys), Beaconsfield High School (girls), or Wycombe High School (girls). Some selected pupils still choose to attend Chesham Grammar School and John Hampden Grammar School (boys) despite both now {{being out of}} catchment.

500|$|The island's {{relief is}} spectacular, a 19th-century {{commentator}} remarking that [...] "the interior is one heap of rude mountains, scarcely possessing {{an acre of}} level land". This combination of geology and topography make for less than ideal agricultural conditions, and {{it is doubtful that}} more than one tenth of the island has ever been cultivated.

25|$|Colonists' {{hopes of}} peace rose {{over the summer}} of 1830-31 as Aboriginal attacks fell to a low level and the Colonial Times {{newspaper}} speculated that their enemy had either been wiped out or frightened into inaction. But the north remained a dangerous place: on 29 January a Dairy Plains woman was murdered—three months after her husband {{had died in a}} similar attack—and in March a mother carrying her infant was fatally speared while working in her garden on the East Tamar. Though the number of attacks in 1831 was less than <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> the previous year—a total of 70, compared with 250 in 1830—settlers remained so fearful that many men refused to go out to work.|$|E
25|$|In early June 1940, the French {{aviation}} industry {{had reached a}} considerable output, with an estimated reserve of nearly 2,000 aircraft. A chronic lack of spare parts crippled this fleet. Only 29 percent (599) of the aircraft were serviceable, of which 170 were bombers. Low serviceability meant the Germans had a clear numerical superiority in medium bomber aircraft, with six {{times as many as}} the French. Despite its disadvantages the Armée de l'Air performed far better than expected, destroying 916 enemy aircraft in air-to-air combat during the Battle of France, for a kill ratio of 2.35:1, with almost <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> kills accomplished by French pilots flying the US built Curtiss Hawk 75, which accounted for 12.6 percent of the French single-seat fighter force.|$|E
25|$|Fewer than <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> aboard Titanic {{survived the}} disaster. Some {{survivors}} died shortly afterwards; injuries {{and the effects}} of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard Carpathia. The figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard Titanic. Although only 3% of first-class women were lost, 54% of those in third class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third class perished. The differences by gender were even bigger: nearly all female crew members, first and second class passengers were saved. Men from the First Class died at a higher rate than women from the Third Class. In total, 50% of the children survived, 20% of the men and 75% of the women.|$|E

According to the shoe factory owner Tareq Abu Felat, the number reached least 35,000 people and there were more than 1,000 {{workshops}} around the city. Statistics from the Chamber of Commerce in Hebron put the figure at 40,000 people employed in 1,200 shoe businesses. However, the 1993 Oslo Accords and 1994 Protocol on Economic Relations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) made it possible to mass import Chinese goods as the Palestinian National Authority, which was created after the Oslo Accords, did not regulate it. They later put import taxes but the Abu Felat, who also is the Palestinian Federation of Leather Industries's chairman, said more is still needed. The Palestinian government decided to impose an additional tax of 35% on products from China from April 2013.|$|E
25|$|His {{early career}} at the Opéra was quite turbulent. The {{institution}} {{at the time was}} seething with discontent: the artistes resented the fact their wages were only <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> of the actors of the Comédie-Française and the Comédie-Italienne; moreover, their pay was only partly fixed and permanent, the rest being linked to how frequently they appeared on stage and the size of their roles. The rebellious Lays soon became embroiled in a heated confrontation with the management, behaving almost like a modern union agitator, with the support of two singers who had joined the company around the same time, the haute-contre J. Rousseau (1761–1800) and the bass Auguste-Athanase Chéron (1760–1829). In June 1781, fire destroyed the second hall of the Palais Royal, the home of the theatre, causing performances to be suspended. This left the singers with only their meagre basic salaries, so the three decided to remedy the situation by accepting engagements elsewhere, even though they were prohibited by law from doing so as salaried artistes of the Académie Royale de Musique. Rousseau alone managed to travel to Brussels surreptitiously and appear at the Théâtre de la Monnaie, then the second most important French-speaking theatre in the world. Lays, however, was arrested on the evening of 20 August 1781, the day before he was due to set off, and spent ten days in prison. He was provisionally released on the 30th because he was indispensable for filling the haute-contre role of Cynire in a revival of Gluck's Echo et Narcisse in the small hall of the Menus-Plaisirs which acted as a substitute for the theatre which had burned down. His enormous popularity with the public, with an encore of the main aria and several curtain-calls, made it practically impossible to send him back to prison, although he was forced to sign a solemn undertaking that he would not leave Paris without the express permission of his superiors.|$|E
500|$|The next {{supernova}} in the Milky Way {{will likely}} be detectable even if it occurs {{on the far side}} of the galaxy.

[...] There is a smaller chance that the next core collapse supernova will be produced by a different type of massive star such as a yellow hypergiant, luminous blue variable, or WolfRayet. [...] The chances of the next supernova being a Type Ia produced by a white dwarf are calculated to be about <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> for a core collapse supernova.

Dr Michael Wilks, chairman of the Medical Ethics Committee stated: [...] "This simply would not happen, but its portrayal, even in a drama, is totally irresponsible and risks causing huge damage to the already struggling transplant programme." [...] The British Medical Association later opined that the show was giving viewers an unrealistic impression of resuscitation by typically presenting only two outcomes, death or total recovery. Andrew Thomson, a Dundee GP, deemed this [...] "a terrible distortion of the truth." [...] In a follow-up story for The Times, Vivienne Parry highlighted {{the fact that in}} reality, less than half of patients who require resuscitation survive the initial catastrophe and only <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> live to leave hospital. At the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) conference in Bournemouth in April 2010, Holby City was accused of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS, encouraging patients to believe in miracles and fuelling compensation culture. Accident and Emergency nurse John Hill stated: [...] "In A it is sometimes a fact that sadly we cannot get people through the trauma they have received.

We perform binary logistic multi-level analyses on the Liveability Monitor of Ghent (N= 1, 037), a midsized city in Belgium. We find that upward neighbourhood change {{is associated with the}} propensity to move based on dissatisfaction with either the home or the neighbourhood for higher-educated respondents, but not for lower and middle-educated respondents. Focussing solely on dissatisfaction with the home, we find that lower and higher educated stayers are both more likely to express moving propensities than their socio-economic peers in non -improving neighbourhoods. We conclude that social displacement seems unlikely based on these results but that caution is necessary when considering displacement based on rising housing prices. We furthermore conclude that both lower and higher educated inhabitants of improving neighbourhoods deserve academic attention...|$|R
