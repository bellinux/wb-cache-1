5|$|A gene is <b>a</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> DNA that {{contains}} genetic information and {{can influence the}} phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins {{is determined by the}} rules of translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from <b>a</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E

5|$|Genes are {{the primary}} units of {{inheritance}} in all organisms. A gene is a unit of heredity and corresponds to a region of DNA that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways. All organisms, from bacteria to animals, share the same basic machinery that copies and translates DNA into proteins. Cells transcribe a DNA gene into an RNA version of the gene, and a ribosome then translates the RNA into <b>a</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> amino acids known as a protein. The translation code from RNA codon to amino acid {{is the same for}} most organisms. For example, <b>a</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> DNA that codes for insulin in humans also codes for insulin when inserted into other organisms, such as plants.|$|E

A slump {{followed}} but Wrexham recovered from a poor October 2002 after coming from behind to beat Bournemouth on 9 November, as strikers Andy Morrell and Lee Trundle formed a good partnership, with Jones an impact substitute. Wrexham {{dropped out of the}} play-off places following <b>a</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> draws in March 2003, but new signing Scott Green scored both goals in a 2–0 win over Hartlepool United on 18 March, the first of <b>a</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> eight victories that took Wrexham into the third automatic promotion place with four matches to go. They held on to the position to secure promotion from the Third Division at the first attempt. Wrexham also beat Newport County 6–1 in the final of the FAW Premier Cup to secure an important £100,000 in prize money.
