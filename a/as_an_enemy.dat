5|$|Norwich, {{then one}} of the largest and most {{important}} cities in the realm, was taken and occupied by Litster and his followers, who caused considerable damage to the property and possessions of anyone they perceived <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> (such as poll tax collectors and important officials) once they managed to enter the city.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{beginning}} of the war, the board of the orchestra received a petition from rank and file players protesting about Borsdorf's continued membership of the LSO. Although he had done as much as anyone to found the orchestra, had lived in Britain for 30 years and was married to an Englishwoman, Borsdorf was regarded by some colleagues <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> alien and was forced out of the orchestra.|$|E
5|$|The new couple {{established}} their household near the Neues Palais, {{in a small}} villa previously inhabited by Auguste von Harrach, the morganatic wife of Frederick William III of Prussia. They also purchased a villa in Cannes, a decision that angered Wilhelm, who viewed France <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> country; Charlotte eventually {{spent most of her}} winters in the French city, as she hoped that its warm climate would help alleviate her lifetime of ill-health.|$|E
5|$|Larkin was {{a notable}} critic of modernism in {{contemporary}} art and literature. His scepticism {{is at its}} most nuanced and illuminating in Required Writing, a collection of his book reviews and essays, and at its most inflamed and polemical {{in his introduction to}} his collected jazz reviews, All What Jazz, drawn from the 126 record-review columns he wrote for The Daily Telegraph between 1961 and 1971, which contains an attack on modern jazz that widens into a wholesale critique of modernism in the arts. Despite the reputation Larkin not unwillingly acquired <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> of modernism, recent critical assessments of Larkin's writings have identified them as possessing some modernist characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Muirhead-Gould {{gave the}} general alarm, along with orders for ships to take anti-submarine measures, at 22:27; the alarm was {{repeated}} at 22:36 with advice for ships to take precautions against attack, <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> submarine {{might be in}} the harbour. At {{the time of the first}} alarm, Sydney Harbour was closed to external traffic, but Muirhead-Gould ordered ferries and other internal traffic to continue, as he believed that having multiple ships travelling around at speed would help force any submarines to remain submerged.|$|E
5|$|The {{guns were}} {{controlled}} from a Battery Commander's Post on the roof, from where commands {{to the gun}} detachments could be relayed via voice pipes. Three depression range finders were installed on the roof by the late 1890s to aid the guns' targeting. A well-trained crew could fire each gun once every two minutes. Rather than firing all the guns at once, the guns were positioned {{so that they could}} be fired in sequence <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> ship passed by. When combined with the fire from Shornemead and Cliffe Forts on the Kent shore, this would ensure that constant fire could be maintained from three different sides.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{borrowed}} {{the character of}} Banquo from Holinshed's Chronicles, a history of Britain published by Raphael Holinshed in 1587. In Chronicles Banquo is an accomplice to Macbeth {{in the murder of}} the king, rather than a loyal subject of the king who is seen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> by Macbeth. Shakespeare may have changed this aspect of his character to please King James, who was thought at the time to be a descendant of the real Banquo. Critics often interpret Banquo's role in the play as being a foil to Macbeth, resisting evil where Macbeth embraces it. Sometimes, however, his motives are unclear, and some critics question his purity. He does nothing to accuse Macbeth of murdering the king, even though he has reason to believe Macbeth is responsible.|$|E

5|$|Yasui {{returned}} to Hood River from Chicago after his father, Masuo Yasui, requested that he come home {{in order to}} report for military duty. After returning to Hood River, he tried to report for duty with the United States Army at the Vancouver Barracks in neighboring Washington, but was denied from serving on nine occasions. Masuo Yasui was arrested on December 13, 1941, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> alien, and had his assets frozen. Min Yasui moved to Portland and opened a private law practice {{in order to help}} the Japanese Americans put their affairs in order. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, that allowed the military to set up exclusion zones, curfews, and ultimately the internment of Japanese Americans during the war.|$|E
5|$|At the {{military}} fort, Alex's reflection {{appears in a}} mirror, giving Alex advice. A ghost then questions them and possesses Jonas, revealing that the ghosts are the passengers of the submarine USS Kanaloa, thought lost at sea. Alex creates another rift that revives Jonas. They find Clarissa, but time loops to her jumping to her death, and then disappearing. Nona, Alex, Jonas and Ren regroup at Harden Tower. Unable to send a radio transmission off the island, Ren suggests finding the key to Maggie Adler's estate, where she kept a boat. The group go to Adler's estate. A possessed Clarissa talks with Ren; her conversations and scattered letters left behind by Maggie Adler reveal that Adler mistakenly interpreted scrambled messages from Kanaloa <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> transmission, and the submarine was sunk by friendly fire. The crew were not killed, however, but transported to another dimension due to the sub's experimental nuclear reactor. Adler and her friend Anna attempted {{to communicate with the}} Kanaloa crew via a radio, but Anna was absorbed through the gateway. The Kanaloa crew intend on using Alex and her friends' bodies to escape the dimension, keeping them on the island long enough for their possession attempts to be successful.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{tendency}} to kill subordinates on a whim, the Joker has no difficulty attracting henchmen with a seemingly infinite cash supply and intimidation: {{they are too}} afraid of their employer to refuse his demands that they wear red clown noses or laugh at macabre jokes. Even with his unpredictability and lack of superhuman powers, the 2007 limited series Salvation Run sees hundreds of villains fall under his spell {{because they are more}} afraid of him than the alternative: Luthor. Batman #186 (1966) introduced the Joker's first sidekick: the one-shot character, Gaggy Gagsworth, who is short, and dressed like a clown; the character was later resurrected <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> of his replacement, Harley Quinn. Introduced in the 1992 animated series, Quinn is the Joker's former Arkham psychiatrist who develops an obsessive infatuation with him and dons a red-and-black harlequin costume to join him in the 1999 graphic novel Batman: Harley Quinn. Although Quinn loves the Joker, he is obsessed with Batman and uses her to achieve his goals at her expense. Despite violent abuse, she returns to him. The Joker is sometimes shown to keep hyenas as pets; this trait was introduced in the 1977 animated series The New Adventures of Batman. A 1976 issue of Batman Family introduced Duela Dent as the Joker's daughter, though her parentage claim was later proven to be false.|$|E

5|$|Rau {{grew up in}} {{a suburb}} of Stuttgart, where early on he became active in socialist youth organizations. After {{military}} service in World War I, he participated in the German Revolution of 1918-19. From 1920 onward, he was a leading agricultural policy maker of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). This ended in 1933, when Adolf Hitler came to power. Shortly afterward Rau was thrown in jail for two years. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> of the Nazi regime in Germany he was imprisoned, in total, {{for more than half of}} the time of Hitler's reign. After his first imprisonment he emigrated in 1935 to the Soviet Union (USSR). From there, in 1937, he went on to Spain, where he participated in the Spanish Civil War as a leader of one of the International Brigades. In 1939, he was arrested in France, and was delivered by the Vichy regime back to Nazi Germany in 1942. After a few months in a Gestapo prison, he was transferred to the Mauthausen Concentration Camp in March 1943. While in the concentration camp he participated in conspiratorial prisoner activities, which led to a camp uprising in the final days before the end of World War II in Europe.|$|E
