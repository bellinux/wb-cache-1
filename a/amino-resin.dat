40|$|DE 19814880 A UPAB: 19991122 NOVELTY - A {{modified}} <b>amino-resin</b> pre-condensates is obtainable from an <b>amino-resin</b> precondensate and a {{fatty acid}} amine (I), optionally as an addition product and/or condensate with an aldehyde (II). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A modified <b>amino-resin</b> pre-condensates (MAV) is obtainable by reacting an <b>amino-resin</b> precondensate (AV) {{with at least}} one amine (I) and/or addition product and/or condensate of N(R 1) (R 2) (R 3) (I) with a 1 - 12 C aldehyde (II) and one or more CHO groups: R 1 = fatty acid group; R 2 = H; fatty acid group; (CH 2 CH 2 O) xH; optionally substituted benzyl; or CH 2 CH 2 NR 4 R 5; R 3 = H or (CH 2 CH 2 O) yH; R 4 = H or (CH 2 CH 2 O) zH; R 5 = fatty acid group; x, y and z = 1 - 50. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for the preparation of the modified condensates (MAV). USE - The MAV are useful as dispersants. They can also be used for the manufacture of micro particles and microcapsules. ADVANTAGE - The MAV have improved interface activity and dispersion behavior than prior art polymer pre-condensates. E. g. they lower the surface tension of water to 0. 8 - 3 mN/m (measured in a xylene/water interface system). Also, as they contain a large number of functional groups, they can be covalently bonded in a polymer composite by co-condensation or condensation with polymers or other prepolymers...|$|E
40|$|NOVELTY - Solid {{particles}} micro-encapsulated with aminoplastic resin, {{in which}} the resin is the condensation product of partly etherated <b>amino-resin</b> precondensates, at least one component of which shows a high surface activity due to co-condensation with an ethoxylated fatty amine, so that the micro-particles are evenly encapsulated even at exposed points. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for the quasi-continuous production of micro-encapsulated particles as above by: (a) introducing the solid particles into a reactor in which an acid-catalysed polycondensation {{of at least two}} <b>amino-resin</b> precondensates is carried out in the aqueous phase; (b) post-curing the polymer in a larger receiver with facilities for continuous removal of the aqueous medium; (c) separating the micro-encapsulated particles from the mother liquor and drying the micro-capsules and (d) working up the mother liquor and recycling it to the process. USE - For the production of micro-encapsulated metal particles, metal oxide particles and crystalline substances (claimed). Applications include substances such as metal flakes, titanium dioxide and other metal oxides, dyes, marker inks, magnetisable particles etc. for use {{in a wide range of}} industries. ADVANTAGE - Enables the quasi-continuous production of micro-encapsulated solid particles with very good homogeneity and uniformity (with regard to capsule wall thickness), without the disadvantages associated with prior-art processes, such as clumping, agglomeration and the formation of aggregates...|$|E
40|$|The working {{temperature}} of electronic components directly determines their service life and stability. In {{order to ensure}} normal operation of electronic components, cooling the coating {{is one of the}} best ways to solve the problem. Based on an acrylic <b>amino-resin</b> system, a dissipating coating was prepared with carbon fiber (CF) as the main thermal conductive filler. The influence of the CF content on the thermal conductivity was determined by the single factor method. The surface structure was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show: With the increase of the CF mass fraction, both the heat dispersion and heat conduction coefficient of the coating tend to increase at first and then decrease, and the heat dissipation effect is optimum when the CF mass fraction is 12. 3 wt %. At this point, the coating shows an excellent comprehensive performance, such as 1 st level adhesion, H grade hardness, and thermal conductivity of 1. 61 W/m·K. Furthermore, this paper explored the radiating mechanism of coating in which CF produces a coating which forms a heat “channel” for rapid heat conduction. When the optimal value is exceeded, the cooling effect is reduced because of the accumulation and the anisotropy of CF...|$|E
