50|$|Chemosensors are {{particularly}} suitable for measurements under difficult conditions {{and in the}} gaseous phase. As sensitive layers, mostly non-selective measuring polymers are used which sort the analytes according to size (the so-called molecular sieve effect when using microporous polymers) or according to polarity (e.g. functionalized polydimethylsiloxanes). When performing non-selective measurements, a sum signal from several analytes is measured which means that multivariate data analyses such as neural networks have {{to be used for}} quantification. However, it is also possible to use selectively measuring polymers, so-called molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) which provide <b>artificial</b> <b>recognition</b> elements.|$|E
50|$|The avidin-biotin {{system is}} a {{technique}} for studying the interaction between two biomolecules in an indirect manner, as follows: Biotin is chemically coupled to a binder molecule (e.g., a protein, DNA, hormone, etc.) without disturbing the interaction with its target molecule; avidin is then used to “sandwich” between the biotinylated binder and a reporter molecule or probe. This allows {{for a variety of}} tasks, including localization and identification of the binder or target molecule. Consequently, the avidin-biotin system can frequently replace radioactive probes.Together with Ed Bayer, Wilchek established the Avidin-biotin system as a powerful tool in biological sciences. Early in the 1970s, they exploited Avidin as a probe and developed new methods and reagents to biotinylate antibodies and other biomolecules. Today, the {{system is a}}pplied in research and diagnostics as well as medical devices and pharmaceuticals. Examples include western blot, ELISA, ELISPOT and pull-down assays.More recently, Wilchek participated in structural studies of the avidin-biotin complex, to characterize the unique properties of this strong interaction. The studies have culminated in the determination of the 3D structure of the avidin-biotin complex by X-ray crystallography, which aids in the design of specific <b>artificial</b> <b>recognition</b> sites.|$|E
