50|$|Another major {{critique}} of the second formula {{is that it is}} difficult to measure regulatory stringency and trade barriers because the two effects are likely endogenous, so few studies have attempted to estimate the indirect effect of trade liberalization on pollution havens. Furthermore, governments at times engage in inefficient competition to actually attract polluting industries through weakening their environmental standards. However, as per conventional economic theory, welfare-maximizing governments should set standards so that the benefits justify the costs at the margin. This does not mean that environmental standards will be equal everywhere, as jurisdictions have different <b>assimilative</b> <b>capacities,</b> costs of abatement, and social attitudes regarding the environment, meaning heterogeneity in pollution standards is to be expected. By extension, this means that industry migration to less stringent jurisdictions may not raise efficiency concerns in an economic sense.|$|R
50|$|<b>Assimilative</b> <b>capacity</b> is a quantitatively useful concept codified in the Clean Water Act {{and other}} laws and {{regulations}} that is unrelated to the perception of an environmental crisis. <b>Assimilative</b> <b>capacity</b> specifically refers to the capacity for a water body to absorb constituents without exceeding a specific concentration, such as a water quality objective. Water quality objectives are set and periodically revised by regulatory agencies, such as the EPA, to define the limits of water quality for different uses, which include human health, but also other ecologically important functions, wildlife habitat, irrigated agriculture, etc. For example, if the irrigation water quality objective for salt is 450 mg/L of total dissolved solids, the <b>assimilative</b> <b>capacity</b> of a water body would be the amount of salt that could {{be added to the}} water such that it's concentration would not exceed 450 mg/L.|$|E

The model was first validated using the R/V Mt. Mitchell expedition profile data, collected from 27 January to 26 February 1992 and from 13 May to 12 June 1992. The validated model was then used to compute the geographic variability of the horizontal dispersion coefficients Kx throughout the gulf. Model results revealed that dispersion was principally driven by the shear associated with the tides, but along the Arabian coast, wind was an additional significant energy source for dispersion. The water residence time was found to be more than 3 years along the Arabian coast, but shorter along the Iranian coast...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{economic and}} institutional constraints to energy development {{reside in the}} obstacles to siting large mining and conversion facilities. These obstacles are of three varieties: (1) industry risks; (2) the problems of satisfying federal planning procedures and environmental impact standards; and (3) the inadequacies of the socioeconomic environments supporting the industry. Industry risks have been widely discussed (see Henry et al., 1973) as have the problems of satisfying environ-mental standards and planning procedures (Federal Energy Administration, Office of Finance and Energy, 1977). This paper summarizes the limitations on energy production and utilization flowing from the siting of new facilities in inade-quate socioeconomic settings.

Complying with Federal and State stream standard for COCs is becoming increasingly difficult for many dischargers. For example, EPA has proposed 5 Φg/l selenium as the chronic numerical criterion for receiving streams. Potential treatment options for waters contaminated with selenium include physical, biological, and chemical methodologies. However, treatment methodologies that will reduce selenium concentrations to levels below 5 Φg/l are expensive and have not been highly successful in field applications. An alternative approach to compliance with selenium, or COCs, may be to alter the regulatory aspects. Several options are discussed including permit modifications, mixing zones, maximizing stream <b>assimilative</b> <b>capacities,</b> modifications to the designated use of a water body, variances, Use Attainability Analyses, increasing the numeric criteria in receiving streams, site-specific numeric water quality criteria changes, and environmental improvement projects.

40|$|Abstract. A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} optimal, conjunctive management of a groundwater basin's quality and quantity resources is presented. The quality resource, the <b>assimilative</b> waste <b>capacity,</b> {{is the ability of}} the aquifer to degrade certain non-conservative constituents through the actions of molecular diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, adsorption, biochemical reactions and convective mass transport. The model is applicable to saturated, isothermal, porous media. The Galerkin method is used to express the spatial and temporal variations in hydraulic head and constituent concentrations as a function of possible recharge, pumping, and treatment decisions. The Galerkin procedure ensures that the constraint equations actually model the response characteristics (flow and mass transport) of the groundwater basin. In each planning period, the groundwater basin is required to meet an exogenous water demand while maintaining adequate water quality levels throughout the aquifer. The model, structured as a mathemat-ical program, minimizes the sum of waste water treatment and pumping and recharge costs. The results indicate (1) the feasibility of conjunctive management of an aquifer's quality and quantity resources, and (2) that the <b>assimilative</b> waste <b>capacity</b> can function as a form of secondary or advanced waste water treatment.

40|$|Within this article, I {{investigate}} {{a number of}} the conceptual issues that arise when attempting to translate Herman Daly's definition of a steady-state economy (SSE) into a set of national biophysical indicators. Although Daly's definition gives a high-level view of what would be held steady in an SSE, it also leaves many questions unanswered. How should stocks and flows be aggregated? What is the role of international trade? How should nonrenewable resources be treated? And where does natural capital fit in? To help answer these questions, I relate Daly's definition to key concepts and terminology from material and energy flow accounting. I explore topics such as aggregation, international trade, the relevance of throughput, and hidden flows. I conclude that a set of biophysical accounts for an SSE should include three types of indicators (stocks, flows, and scale), track how stocks and flows are changing over a 5 - to 10 -year period, use aggregated data that measure the quantity of resource use (rather than its quality), measure both total and nonrenewable resource use, adopt a consumption-based approach, include hidden flows, and exclude indicators that measure characteristics of the stock of natural capital (with the notable exception of indicators that measure the regenerative and <b>assimilative</b> <b>capacities</b> of ecosystems) ...|$|R

Our finding might be suggested as temperature inverted impact to heterotrophic activities in eutrophic conditions. We assume that observed, with temperature raise, declined EEA was due to blocked enzymatic active center from colloids and DOM components interaction, which, in overall, may suppress organic substrate utilization and result in weakening of first and rate limiting step of biological self-purification in Lake Sevan waters.

Eleven potentially hazardous elements (As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Se, V, and Zn) generated by a co-disposal landfill leachate have been considered. Experimental column and static equilibrium methods for the determination of dispersion and adsorption are described. Molecular diffusion dominates the migration phenomena with a velocity range between 1. 3 x 10 (- 5) and 3. 5 x 10 (- 4) cm/s throughout the experiments. A simple way to evaluate dispersion coefficients from breakthrough curves gave values of between 3. 90 x 10 (- 6) and 3. 5 x 10 (- 4) cm(2) /s, with a mean value of 1. 5 x 10 (- 5).

But the <b>assimilative</b> [108] <b>capacity</b> of the Greek mind--its power of Hellenizing whatever it touched--has here worked so effectually, that, so far as I can learn, no indubitable traces of such extraneous contributions are now allowed to exist by the most authoritative historians of Philosophy. Nevertheless, I think it must be admitted that the coincidences between the Heracleito-stoical doctrines and those of the older Hindu philosophy are extremely remarkable. In both, the cosmos pursues an eternal succession of cyclical changes. The great year, answering to the Kalpa, covers an entire cycle from the origin of the universe as a fluid to its dissolution in fire--"Humor initium, ignis exitus mundi," [...] as Seneca has it. In both systems, there is immanent in the cosmos a source of energy, Brahma, or the Logos, which works according to fixed laws. The individual soul is an efflux of this world-spirit, and returns to it. Perfection is attainable only by individual effort, through ascetic discipline, and is rather a state of painlessness than of happiness; if indeed it can be said to be a state of anything, save the negation of perturbing emotion.

This rate could be set by either the maximum sustainableyield (say for forests or fisheries) or the <b>assimilative</b> <b>capacity</b> of theenvironment (e.g. for [...] or chlorine), but both quantities are very difficult to determine, so the 'environmental space' has rather large error limits and is therefore hard to defend in policy discussions. A further difficulty isthat there is a different 'environmental space' for each kind of resource,and as they each necessarily have different units of measure, they cannot beadded to get an overall environmental space for all the resources consumed by a country. Theidea of environmental space was promoted quite strongly by Friends of the Earth Europe in themid-1990s, but it is rarely used now, because of the aforementioned difficulties, and has essentially been superseded by 'ecological footprint'.

40|$|Despite having {{potentials}} {{for economic}} growth, natural resource-rich regions in developing countries, like East Kalimantan Province of Indonesia, often face problems emerged from unequal distribution of development benefits and extreme exploitation of natural resources. Economic inequality and poverty on one hand, and threat of unsustainability on the other, are thus common. Essentially, the problems {{share a common}} root of cause, namely inequity. The main question is therefore: “Given that the immediately viable prospects of achieving economic development in developing countries lie in natural resource-rich regions, how can public policy in such regions assist in promoting intra-and inter-generational equity, and thus sustainability? ” In the way of answering it, the paper proposes a theoretical framework for public policy reformulation that can help resolving the problems in East Kalimantan. The regional development of East Kalimantan should consequently apply equity in four main functions, i. e. in the benefit distribution to the people, in the production function of natural resources, in the nonproduction function, and in the reinvestment for sustainability. Equity failures in the benefit distribution would end up to problems of poverty and economic inequality. Also, inequity in the production function would cause problems of benefit leakages to foreign countries, along {{with the threat of}} unsustainability due to excessive exploitation.

In higher education institutions, particularly in the health sciences, knowledge retention becomes essential for learning and for efficient and effective training of capable health professionals. MethodologyThis is a prospective cohort study, conducted at the Lurio University, Mozambique. To evaluate the assimilation and retention of knowledge, a theoretical lesson was taught. The class time was 90 minutes divided into a theoretical stageand the other was a discussion stage (30 minutes) for clarification of doubts. Questionnaire was administered in the pretest, post-test and after six months. ResultsOf all students (n= 241), enrolled in the second semester of {{the first year of the}} course, 190 students did the pretest, 187 did the post-test and 183 students did the test after six months. Before the lecture none of the course managed to achieve the satisfactory percentage of 75 % of correct answers (p< 0, 001).

40|$|Pakistan is a {{developing}} country bracing for significant economic growth and development in the future. In this regards, the country is poised to shift towards an increased reliance upon its indigenous coal reserves to fuel its development in the 2010 - 2050 time frame. Although this will significantly raise its projected greenhouse gas emissions, the present study has identified numerous measures which {{can be taken to}} shift this future development pathway on to a lower carbon and more climate friendly trajectory. The country, however, requires this shift to be supported through the access and transfer of appropriate technologies and finance. The ensuing “additional” financial needs for mitigation for a cleaner development future range from between U$ 8 billion and U$ 17 billion. These have been identified in this report along with a potential of 18 % and 40 % reduction of emissions between below “Business As Usual” scenario which is possible with a shift towards cleaner technologies. These clean development investments, however, need {{to be made in the}} near future as otherwise the energy future of Pakistan will get locked into the lower cost - higher carbon options. This mitigation costing estimate will, however, need to be refined and focused further as Pakistan identifies not only the specific technologies that it needs for this low carbon shift (through carrying out the “Technology Needs Assessment”) but also the programmatic, sectoral as well as project specific NAMAs (Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions) in the near future. Pakistan is also highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and faces immense associated challenges in coping with its unavoidable effects and economic implications. This study has highlighted the need to treat adaptation to climate change as a primary development issue for Pakistan. The potential impacts and sectors demanding prioritized adaptation have been identified in this study and the, associated, costs of adaptation have been estimated utilizing three diverse modeling methodologies – using GDP projections, per-capita figures and “flood” disaster modeling. The resulting adaptation cost figures range from between U$ 6 billion to U$ 14 billion/year that Pakistan would have to spend at an average in the 2010 - 2050 time frame to cope with the effects of climate change while it will be also left to, unavoidably, bear significant “residual damage” costs induced due to climate change. The top-down adaptation costing analysis applied in this report is aimed at providing a reasonable first approximation that can be refined over time as relevant and reliable local data becomes available especially from research focusing on sector specific adaptation costing. Most significantly the report reinforces the fact that the issue of climate change is, thus, not only an environmental issue challenging the country but an issue which will directly impinge upon the country’s economic, financial and development future as it deals with its extreme vulnerability to climate change. The significant climate costs identified in this study inextricably shows that climate change is an issue which Pakistan can ill afford to ignore in the future. Finally the report has identified the major financing options available for climate change related activities in Pakistan as well as the significant unilateral climate resources, U$ 4. 5 billion in 2007 - 2009 alone, that the country is already committing to climate change without getting any global recognition for its efforts. In future, global financing will need to augment and leverage such national financial commitments. Also, as climate finance becomes increasingly available at the global level, it would be essential to enact appropriate <b>assimilative</b> national <b>capacity</b> in Pakistan to direct this finance towards nationally identified priorities as well as channelize it transparently and efficiently through consolidated financial mechanisms like a National Climate Change Fund which has been proposed through this study. ...|$|R
40|$|In our paper, we analyse the {{prospects}} for sustainable growth offered by recycling promoting environmental policies where the main objective of the government is to assure for sustainability {{in the sense of}} a non deteriorating state of the environment. The environment is important for economic production in a twofold way: firstly, it supplies resources as inputs for the production process and, secondly, it serves as a sink for all kinds of waste products generated by economic activities. It is shown that in the absence of environmental policy the overexploitation of the renewable resource stock and the dumping of waste will drive nature beyond the limits of its <b>assimilative</b> and regenerative <b>capacity.</b> Therefore, we focus on these phenomena by modelling on the one hand recycling processes that decrease the flow of waste to the environment and considering on the other hand requirements for a sustainable extraction of raw materials. Hence, by including the intention to spare resources and the aim of reducing waste, we deal with an input problem - sometimes referred to as the primary problem - and an output problem - referred to as the secondary problem. Both problems can be considered to have local, regional and global impacts. For example, reduced resource requirements might decrease the dependency of resource-importing countries (local or regional effect) and will also help to maintain the supply of resources in all world regions (global effect). Alternatively consider the example of a reduction in the combustion of waste which is due to an increase in recycling. The reduction will cause the mitigation of local and regional air pollution as well as of global warming causing emissions of CO 2. Hence, one far-reaching policy additionally induces ancillary benefits on different geographical levels. We use the framework of an endogenous growth model where waste is generated as an undesired byproduct in the production of the desired output. Nature is assumed to have a certain regenerative capability which depends on the state of the environment. Furthermore, environmental quality is negatively affected by the amount of waste dumped and the amount of resources extracted. The amount of dumped waste can be reduced by recycling firms which process the waste and sell it to the intermediate sector where it serves as substitute for natural resources as an input in production. We show that balanced sustainable growth is only possible if governmental policy ensures a recycling rate of unity. By reviewing the debate on complete recycling, we finally discuss this result from an ecological economics point of view. It is shown that the feasibility of complete recycling depends critically on the nature of wastes, a sufficient storing space for wastes and the availability of sufficient energy. growth; recycling; secondary effects; sustainability. ...|$|R
