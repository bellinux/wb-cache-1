40|$|An algorithm, the modeled fault {{constrained}} innovation hybrid estimator (MF-CIHE), {{is proposed}} to quickly and correctly detect a nonconforming taxiing aircraft from {{a set of}} noisy measurements using estimation and fault detection techniques. Both spatial and temporal conformance monitoring are considered. The spatial conformance monitoring algorithm is based on formally modeling the aircraft and the assigned taxiway as a constrained stochastic linear hybrid system. Constrained stochastic linear hybrid systems (CSLHS) are stochastic linear hybrid systems that have state equality constraints on the dynamics of each mode. A proposed estimator, the constrained innovation hybrid estimator (CIHE), is derived {{in such a way}} that the expectation of the innovations of the mode-matched filters satisfy the constraints. Therefore, the constraint information in the innovation results in faster mode detection and smaller estimation errors than unconstrained hybrid estimators. It is proved that the CIHE is unbiased and produces residuals that have zero mean if the system is conforming to the model (which allows the estimator to be used for fault detection and identification (FDI)). Two residuals are generated by the estimator that are shown to distinguish between a discrete or constraint fault (or nonconformance). Temporal conformance monitoring is accomplished by projecting the state estimate of the aircraft into a coordinate frame that moves at the <b>assigned</b> <b>speed</b> of the aircraft. A nonconformance is detected when the coordinates of the aircraft in that frame exceed a design threshold. The proposed algorithms are validated using simulations of an aircraft at the Cleveland-Hopkins (CLE) airport. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has smaller estimation error than unconstrained estimators, that it can detect a nonconforming aircraft within two measurement sampling periods with small false alarm rates for a several different nonconforming scenarios, and that the temporal conformance monitoring algorithm is able to successfully detect a temporal nonconformance. ...|$|E

This results in a single-agent and multi-agent approach to <b>assign</b> <b>speed</b> limits to highway sections. A difference between our work and existing approaches is that we also take traffic predictions into account.

The impacts are particularly acute at the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport in Anchorage, Alaska {{due to its}} importance as a major international portal.

40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{sensitivity}} of the Urban Airshed Model’s (UAM) ozone predictions to three assumptions in the motor vehicle emission calculations: trip average emission factor, average daily temperature, and uniform speed by road classification. These assumptions were tested by preparing a series of motor vehicle modeling inventories using conventional methodology, disaggregated emission factors, hourly temperature profiles, and speeds by road. These inventories were then merged with the area, point, biogenic, and nonroad mobile inventory for a 1988 ozone episode in Charlotte, North Carolina, and used in UAM simulations. Spatially and temporally allocating the disaggregated emissions to trip starts, trip ends, and trip mileage increased both the maximum gridded hourly emissions and the variability of gridded hourly emissions. VOC and CO showed a larger change than NO X. This reallocation moved emissions from major highway corridors to the central business district. Varying the temperature by hour had little effect on emissions. <b>Assigning</b> <b>speeds</b> to individual roads using output from a travel demand model decreased NO X and significantly increased VOC emissions.

40|$|Vehicle {{tracking}} {{is one of}} {{the critical}} applications of object detection and tracking. Traffic surveillance has become crucial {{in this day and age}} where the number of vehicles on the road has risen considerably. To preserve the safety of motorists, traffic law enforcement <b>assign</b> <b>speed</b> limits at different locations throughout the country. However, irresponsible motorists still exceed the speed limit since they know it is unlikely that they will get caught. In this paper, a system is developed which is capable of detecting moving vehicles in a video and display the vehicles speed as it goes. Should a vehicle exceed the allowed speed limit, it will be displayed in the video alongside the vehicle so that traffic law enforcers will be able to take necessary action based on the displayed speed. The system uses Matlab/Simulink as a simulation platform as it provides comprehensive tools for thresholding, filtering and blob analysis. Optical flow was the image processing technique used to determine the moving vehicles. A median filter was used to remove salt and pepper noise from the thresholded image. Combinations of several morphological operations were used to rectify whatever that is left. Blob analysis produces rectangles around the moving objects. The centroid of the rectangle is used to determine the location of each vehicle at a given frame. To make up for the absence of depth perception, the camera’s height and angle from the road is fixed so that the rate of which a vehicle approaches the camera can be determined. The results show that the system successfully detects vehicles and displays its speed, though there is a relatively small margin of error for the displayed speed. The displayed speed is set to only change once every couple of frames so that it would be easier to see...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{is a major}} concern for designers of embedded devices. Especially for battery operated systems (like many embedded systems), the energy consumption limits the time for which a device can be active, and the amount of processing that can take place. In this thesis we study how the energy consumption can be reduced for certain classes of real-time applications. To minimise the energy consumption, we introduce several algorithms that combine power management techniques with scheduling (algorithmic power management). The power management techniques that we focus on are speed scaling and sleep modes. When the processor (or some peripheral) is active, its speed, and with it the supply voltage, can be decreased to reduce the power consumption (speed scaling), while when the processor is idle it can be put in a low power mode (sleep modes). The resulting problem is to determine a schedule, speeds for the processors (which may vary over time) and/or times when a device is put to sleep. We discuss energy minimisation for three classes of real-time systems, namely (1) real-time systems with agreeable deadlines, (2) real-time systems with precedence constraints, and (3) frame-based real-time systems. Below we elaborate on these classes of real-time systems. (1) For real-time systems with agreeable deadlines it holds that an earlier arrival time implies an earlier deadline (and vice versa). Compared to existing methods our algorithms can reduce the energy consumption by up to 54 % for the considered multimedia workloads, and our evaluation shows that these algorithms are near optimal even with inaccurate predictions. (2) The second class of real-time systems we focus on are tasks with precedence constraints that must be scheduled on a multicore system and for which the speeds have to be determined. We derive a scheduling criterion that implicitly <b>assigns</b> <b>speeds</b> and minimises the energy consumption. (3) In the third setting, we study the optimal combination of speed scaling, sleep modes and scheduling for frame-based real-time systems. While the literature considers only trivial schedules for this problem, we study energy optimal schedules for such systems...|$|R

This research examined the perception of the signature to the forger (how easy an individual perceives the signature to be forged), and whether there were any characteristics common among the groupings of difficulty. The dynamic variables of the signature were then examined to establish which statistical variables were susceptible to forgery using forensic tools. Overall, it seems that both the genuine and impostor groups do not single out a specific dynamic trait within their judgment of an “easy ” or “difficult ” signature. Furthermore, it also shows that individuals have difficulty in <b>assigning</b> a <b>speed</b> to their signature – i. e. the perception of speed is different for each individual (both genuine and impostor), and additionally, both the impostors and genuine users ranked their signatures differently when asked about the perceived level of difficulty...|$|R
50|$|The Fujita scale, {{introduced}} in 1971 {{as a means}} to differentiate tornado intensity and path area, <b>assigned</b> wind <b>speeds</b> to damage that were, at best, educated guesses.

This research, as well as subsequent research, showed that tornado wind speeds required to inflict the described damage were actually much lower than the F-scale indicated, particularly for the upper categories. Also, although the scale gave general descriptions for the type of damage a tornado could cause, it gave little leeway for strength of construction and other factors that might cause a building to receive higher damage at lower wind speeds. Fujita tried to address these problems somewhat in 1992 with the Modified Fujita Scale, but by then he was semi-retired and the National Weather Service was not in a position for the undertaking of updating to an entirely new scale, so it went largely unenacted.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{integrates}} {{energy management}} with fault tolerance for real time systems. A typical system {{composed of a}} processor (frequency dependent) and peripheral devices (frequency independent) when operates in harsh environmental conditions may collapse due to occurrence of transient faults or shortage of battery backup. The fault tolerance is achieved via checkpointing while dynamic voltage scaling, dynamic power down and preemption control techniques are used to improve the battery life. We adopt a two phase approach. In the first phase, we estimate a critical speed which effectively balances the fault tolerance requirement and the energy consumed by both the associated frequency dependent and independent devices. The Phase- 1 uses energy aware greedy based speed assignment technique to <b>assign</b> the <b>speeds</b> to each task such that the task set is feasible with low enenergy requirement. The second phase further, reduces energy consumption by preemption control technique.

40|$|Translation of mRNA into {{protein is}} a {{unidirectional}} information flow process.
