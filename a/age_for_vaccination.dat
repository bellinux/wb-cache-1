40|$|Sexually {{transmitted}} diseases caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) are being diagnosed {{more frequently than}} others. It is accepted that HPV infection is a necessary cause for all cases of cervical carcinoma {{and a large number}} of other anogenital and oral cancers. Two vaccines have been developed and were licensed in 2007, which can prevent infections and pre-cancerous lesions due to HPV. In Italy pre-adolescent age (12 years-old) was identified as the ideal <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> against HPV. In Liguria, the first free HPV vaccination campaign was started on 8 March 2008 in 12 year-old girls.

40|$|This {{literature}} review explores the prevention and {{early detection of}} cervical cancer in the UK. Current findings indicate {{that there is a}} risk for women under the age of 25 years, who may develop cervical cancer. There appears to be a gap in UK policy that may overlook these women, who are beneath the age for initial screening but exceed the <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Despite the inextricable link between sexual activity and cervical cancer, cervical screening and sexual health promotion still appear to be disjointed, and the role of a sexually transmitted infection leading to the development of cervical cancer has not been emphasised enough in public health messages. Further training should be provided and its impact monitored, designed to address this anomaly in health promotion. There are many barriers to health promotion including, those of a societal, cultural and religious nature. Additional research is required to ascertain the types of educational and awareness interventions that would be most effective in promoting and encouraging positive sexual behaviours among young people, and to explore how these might be successfully implemented...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundA {{tetravalent}} dengue vaccine demonstrated its protective efficacy in two phase III efficacy studies. Results {{from these}} studies {{were used to}} derive vaccination impact in the five Asian (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam) and the five Latin American countries (Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico and Puerto Rico) participating in these trials. MethodsVaccination impact was investigated with an age-structured, host-vector, serotype-specific compartmental model. Parameters related to vaccine efficacy and levels of dengue transmission were estimated using data collected during the phase III efficacy studies. Several vaccination programs, including routine vaccination at different ages with and without large catch-up campaigns, were investigated. ResultsAll vaccination programs explored translated into significant reductions in dengue cases at the population level over the first 10 years following vaccine introduction and beyond. The most efficient <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> varied according to transmission intensity and 9 years {{was close to the}} most efficient age across all settings. The combination of routine vaccination and large catch-up campaigns was found to enable a rapid reduction of dengue burden after vaccine introduction.

40|$|Major {{advances}} in preventing, delaying, or curing individual pathologies {{are responsible for}} an increasingly long life span in the developed parts of our planet, and indeed reaching eight to nine decades of life is nowadays extremely frequent. However, medical and sanitary advances have not prevented or delayed the underlying cause of the disparate pathologies occurring in the elderly: aging itself. The identification of {{the basis of the}} aging processes that drives the multiple pathologies and loss of function typical of older individuals is a major challenge in current aging research. Among the possible causes, an impairment of the immune system plays a major role, and indeed numerous studies have described immunological changes which occur with age. Far from the intention of being exhaustive, this review will focus on recent advances and views on the role that modifications of cell signalling and remodelling of the immune response play during human aging and longevity, paying particular attention to phenomena which are linked to the so called inflammaging process, such as dysregulation of innate immunity, altered T-cell or B-cell maturation and differentiation, {{as well as to the}} implications of immune <b>aging</b> <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> strategies in the elderly...|$|R
40|$|There {{is still}} {{controversy}} about the optimum <b>age</b> <b>for</b> measles <b>vaccination</b> in developing countries, where {{the incidence of}} measles infection is higher {{in the first few}} months of life than it is in developed countries. This study was undertaken to collect reliable data in order to determine the optimum <b>age</b> <b>for</b> mass <b>vaccination</b> programmes. Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies were titrated periodically from birth to one year of age in children who were given the vaccine at different ages, between 5 and 9 months. It was found that 90 % of children no longer have their maternal antibodies at 7 - 8 months of age, precisely at the period that the incidence of measles begins to rise sharply. Almost all children showed HI seroconversion when vaccinated at 71 / 2 months (or later, but not before), even if a low level of maternal antibody still persisted when the vaccine was given. These data show that there is an advantage in carrying out measles vaccination at 71 / 2 months of age in countries with conditions similar to that of Kenya. The duration of post-vaccinal immunity beyond one year of age has not been studied, but it can reasonably be expected that immunity after one <b>vaccination</b> can last <b>for</b> at least 3 - 5 years, thus exceeding the period when African children are most exposed to malnutrition...|$|R
40|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} the second most common {{gynecologic}} cancer. A steady 70 % annual decline in mortality from cervical cancers has been observed since the mid 20 th century after the introduction of widespread papanicolaou cytological screening. But also cervical cancer continues to be an important world health problem for women. Cervical cancer is one of the best- understood neoplasm given its well known viral cause of persistent infection with high risk human papillomavirus (HPV). To date, two manufacturers have developed HPV vaccines composed of noninfectious, recombinant HPV viral-like particles (VLPs). This article presents current advances and perspectives on HPV vaccines. The vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection, and the recommended schedule is a 3 -dose series with the second and third doses administered 2 and 6 months after the first dose.

In comparison with 250 mother–infant’s paired sera, we found that 53 % of the infants ’ serum HI titers were higher than those of the mother’s. The mother/infant IgG subclasses 1, 2, 3, and 4 titers were 53. 1 / 87. 0, 8. 4 / 11. 7, 0. 14 / 0. 11, and 1. 1 / 1. 0 mg/dL, respectively. In 18 months of follow-up of 100 infants studied, we observed that antibody to dengue virus disappeared in 3 % by two months of age, in 19 % by four months of age, in 72 % by six months of age, in 99 % by nine months of age, and in 100 % by 12 months of age, with a half-life of 41 days. We conclude that the antibodies to dengue virus disappeared {{in the first year of}} life.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} {{prevalence}} of IgG antibodies to human parvovirus B 19. METHODS: Cross-sectional study in a suburban community in São Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, between November 1990 and January 1991. Randomly selected (N= 435) representative samples of sera were collected from healthy children older than 15 days old and adults up to 40 years old. IgG antibodies were detected using ELISA. RESULTS: High prevalence of IgG antibodies to B 19 parvovirus was found in 87 % of newborns. The prevalence of maternally derived IgG antibodies exponentially plunged up to the 19 th month of age. Low prevalence of antibodies {{was found in the}} first 4 years of life, increasing up to 72 % in those aged 31 - 40 years.

40|$|Understanding {{age-specific}} {{differences in}} infection rates can {{be important in}} predicting the magnitude of and mortality in outbreaks and targeting <b>age</b> groups <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> programmes. Standard methods to estimate age-specific rates assume that the age-specific force of infection is constant in time. However, this assumption may easily be violated {{in the face of}} a highly variable outbreak history, as recently observed for acute immunizing infections like measles, in strongly seasonal settings. Here we investigate the biases that result from ignoring such fluctuations in incidence and present a correction based on the epidemic history. We apply the method to data from a measles outbreak in Niamey, Niger and show that, despite a bimodal age distribution of cases, the estimated age-specific force of infection is unimodal and concentrated in young children (< 5 years) consistent with previous analyses of age-specific rates in the region...|$|R

40|$|Serological {{studies have}} many {{important}} epidemiologic applications.

Since 1995 a varicella vaccine is available and it has been recommended in several countries (e. g. USA, Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, Ecuador, etc.). Nevertheless few varicella seroprevalence studies in countries that adopted an URV are available. It is related to the relatively recent introduction of the vaccination and to the lack of structured and collaborative surveillance systems based on serosurvey at national or regional level. Varicella seroprevalence data collected before the introduction of vaccination strategies allowed to establish the age of vaccination (e. g., indicated the opportunity to offer the vaccine to Italian susceptible adolescents). In the post-vaccination era, seroprevalence data demonstrated vaccine as immunogenic and excluded an increase of the age of infection linked to the vaccination strategy. New seroprevalence studies should be performed to answer to open questions, such as the long-term immunity and the change of the herpes zoster epidemiological pattern related to the vaccine...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Since its {{introduction}} into northern Europe in 2006, bluetongue {{has become a}} major threat to animal health. While the efficacy of commercial vaccines has been clearly demonstrated in livestock, little is known regarding the effect of maternal immunity on vaccinal efficacy. Here, we have investigated the duration and amplitude of colostral antibody-induced immunity in calves born to dams vaccinated against bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV- 8) and the extent of colostral antibody-induced interference of vaccination in these calves. Twenty-two calf-cow pairs were included in this survey. The median age at which calves became seronegative for BTV was 84 and 112 days as assayed by seroneutralisation test (SNT) and VP 7 BTV competitive ELISA (cELISA), respectively. At the mean age of 118 days, 13 / 22 calves were immunized with inactivated BTV- 8 vaccine. In most calves vaccination elicited a weak immune response, with seroconversion in only 3 / 13 calves. The amplitude of the humoral response to vaccination was inversely proportional to the maternal antibody level prior to vaccination. Thus, the lack of response was attributed to the persistence of virus-specific colostral antibodies that interfered with the induction of the immune response. These data suggest that the recommended <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> of calves born to vaccinated dams needs to be adjusted in order to optimize vaccinal efficacy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Where {{immunization}} campaigns locally eliminate measles, it will {{be important}} to identify the vaccination policy most likely to prevent future epidemics. The optimum <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> depends on the rate of decline of maternal antibody, because the presence of antibody reduces vaccine efficacy. The first part of this paper contains a quantitative reappraisal of the data on antibody decline and seroconversion rates by age. The decline in maternal antibody protection follows delayed exponentials, with delays of 2 - 4 months, and subsequent half-lives of 1 - 2 months. Using this result in an analytical mathematical model we find that the optimal age to administer a single dose of vaccine to children, which is independent of vaccine coverage, lies within the range 11 - 19 months. We also show that, where the optimal age cannot be met, it is better to err towards late rather than early vaccination. There are therefore two reasons why developing countries, which presently vaccinate during infancy because measles transmission rates are high should eventually switch to the second year of life. The possible gains from two-dose vaccination schedules are explored with respect to both coverage and efficacy. A two-dose schedule will be beneficial, in principle, only when {{there is a need to}} increase net vaccine efficacy, after coverage has been maximized with a one-dose schedule...|$|E

By extrapolation it was concluded that the current Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI) target <b>age</b> <b>for</b> measles <b>vaccination</b> of 9 months was an appropriate choice for this area. At the age of 24 months acquired MV-specific antibodies were detected in 65 – 85 % of the cohort, which corresponded well with the 79 % of infants reported to be vaccinated by this age.

40|$|Abstract Background In France, it is {{recommended}} that girls and women aged 14 – 23 are vaccinated against the human papillomavirus (HPV). However, French women’s knowledge of and attitude towards the vaccine has been little studied. Methods Thirty-nine general practitioners, representative of those working in the large Rhône-Alpes region, offered a self-administered questionnaire on cervical cancer (CC) prevention to all 18 – 65 year-old women who came for consultation during June and July 2008. In addition, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with a sample of those who had daughters aged 14 – 18. Results Of the 1, 478 women who completed the questionnaire, only 16. 9 % mentioned HPV as the cause of CC, even though 76. 2 % knew of the vaccine. 210 women had daughters aged 14 – 18, and 32 were interviewed. Compared with the wider group, more of these women were aware of the HPV vaccine (91. 4 %). 44. 8 % knew the target population and 17. 1 % the recommended <b>ages</b> <b>for</b> <b>vaccination.</b> 54. 3 % favoured HPV vaccination; 37. 2 % were undecided and only 0. 9 % were opposed. The main barrier to acceptance was the recency of the vaccine’s introduction and concern about possible side effects (54. 9 %); 14. 1 % preferred to rely on their GP’s decision. Factors associated with acceptance of the HPV vaccine were having previously vaccinated a child against pneumococcus (OR= 3. 28 [1. 32 - 8. 11]) and knowing the target population <b>for</b> HPV <b>vaccination</b> (OR= 2. 12 [1. 15 - 3. 90]). Knowing the recommended frequency of Papanicolaou smear testing (Pap test) screening was associated with lower acceptance (OR= 0. 32 [0. 13 - 0. 82]). Conclusions Few mothers are opposed to HPV vaccination. Factors associated with acceptability were knowledge about the vaccine, acceptance of other vaccines and, unexpectedly, lack of knowledge about the recommended frequency of Pap testing. On multivariate analysis, compliance with recommendations for Pap test screening and socioeconomic factors had no effect on views about HPV vaccination. Given that concern about possible side effects is the major barrier to wider acceptance of the HPV vaccine in France, GPs have a key role in providing information. </p...|$|R

The base case examined the net costs and benefits during the period 1986 - 2040; the model assumed differential costs for oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and vaccine delivery in industrialized and developing countries, and ignored all benefits aside from reductions in direct costs for treatment and rehabilitation. The model showed that the "break-even" point at which benefits exceeded costs was the year 2007, with a saving of US$ 13 600 million by the year 2040.

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess carriage rates and anti-streptococcal C 5 a peptidase (anti-SCP) IgG levels and identify epidemiologic factors related to carriage or seropositivity in Australian children. A throat swab and blood sample were collected for microbiological and serological analysis (anti-SCP IgG) in 542 healthy children aged 0 - 10 years. Sequence analysis of the SCP gene was performed. Serological analysis used a competitive Luminex Immunoassay designed to preferentially detect functional antibody. GAS-positive culture prevalence in throat swabs was 5. 0 % (range 0 - 10 %), with the highest rate in 5 and 9 years old children. The rate of non-GAS BHS carriage was low (< 1 %). The scp gene was present in all 22 isolates evaluated. As age of child increased, the rate of carriage increased; odds ratio, 1. 14 (1. 00, 1. 29); P = 0. 50. Geometric mean anti-SCP titers increased with each age-band from 2 to 7 years, then plateaued.

A number of 20, 160 fertile eggs was distributed according to a completely randomized design in a 4 x 2 factorial arrangement (in-ovo vaccination on 16, 17, 18, or 19 days of incubation, and breeders of 31 or 52 weeks of age), totaling eight treatments with 15 replicates of 168 eggs each. Vaccination procedures and vaccines (strains and doses) were those routinely applied in commercial hatcheries. After hatch, 960 male chicks were housed and distributed according to the same experimental design previously applied in the hatchery. There were hatching losses (p< 0. 05) when eggs were vaccinated before 18 days of incubation.

40|$|Background: Early coital {{exposure}} {{is associated with}} multiple sexual partners and higher risk of sexually transmitted infections including oncogenic human papilloma virus (HPV) which is a precursor of cervical cancer. Aim: To document the determinants of premarital sex {{with a view to}} determine the age of HPV vaccination. Methods: A cross sectional study of 221 respondents carried out between January and April 2010. Results: The majority, 188 (85. 1 %) were aged 20 - 29 years. The mean age was 24. 73 + 4. 929. Males constituted 125 (56. 6 %) with 165 (74. 7 %) being single. One hundred and eighty (81. 4 %) were university students. Most, 111 (50. 2 %) have not had premarital sex. Twenty four (10. 9 %) had early sexual exposure (<age 15) while 60 (27. 1 %) initiated intercourse between 16 - 20 years. Eighty two (37. 1 %) had premarital intercourse with statistically significant preponderance of males over females (X 2 = 10. 844, P= 0. 004). Ninety five percent of respondents agree that an STI vaccine should be given with most respondents (96; 43. 4 %) citing age group 10 - 15 years as the most appropriate <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>vaccination.</b> After logistic regression analysis, determinants of premarital sex were religion (OR 3. 1, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 4. 7) and occupation (OR 2. 5, 95 % CI 1. 7 - 14).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and evaluate new baits for the oral delivery of vaccine preparations to 2 – 4 month-old wild boar piglets. Baits were prepared using a matrix composed of wild boar feed, wheat flour, paraffin, sacarose and cinnamon-truffle powder attractant with polyethylene capsules dipped into the matrix to introduce vaccine formulation. Physical stability studies demonstrated that baits were stable for at least three days at temperatures as high as 42 °C. Recombinant Escherichia coli expressing the membrane-displayed BM 95 -MSP 1 a fusion protein were used to test bacterial viability in the baits and the antibody response in orally immunized wild boar. The E. coli viability was not significantly affected after bait incubation at 25 and 37 °C for 96 h. Bait acceptance studies using artificial feeders in the field showed that baits were accepted by 2 – 3 month-old animals, the preferred <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Orally immunized wild boar piglets excreted recombinant E. coli in the feces and developed antibody titers to recombinant BM 95 -MSP 1 a protein, thus confirming that vaccine composition was released and reached the wild boar gastrointestinal track. The results of these experiments support the use of these baits for oral delivery of vaccine formulations to 2 – 4 month-old wild boar piglets.

Although in some cases low immunization coverage has been well explained by active refusal or resistance to vaccination, little is known about the reasons for low coverage where those reactions are absent or play a minor role, especially outside an epidemic context. This study attempts to explain this situation, which is found in the health district of Nouna in Burkina Faso. Methods An in-depth ethnographic study was undertaken in the health district of Nouna in an effort to understand, from an anthropological point of view, the logic behind the parental decision-making process regarding the vaccination or non-vaccination of children, in a context where rejection of, and reservations concerning vaccination are not major obstacles. Results Three elements emerged from the analysis: the empirical conceptions of childhood diseases, the perceived efficacy of vaccine and the knowledge of appropriate <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> uptake; the gap between the decision-making process and the actual achievement of vaccination; and the vaccination procedure leading to vaccination uptake in the particular context of the health district of Nouna. Conclusion The procedures parents must follow in order to obtain vaccination for their children appear complex and constraining, and on certain points discord with the traditional systems of meaning and idioms of distress related to pregnancy, the prevention of childhood diseases and with the cultural matrix shaping decision-making and behaviour. Attention needs to be directed at certain promotional, logistical and structural elements, and at the procedure that must currently be followed to obtain vaccination for a child during routine vaccination sessions, which are currently limiting the active demand for vaccination.

40|$|Purpose: Breast or {{cervical}} cancer screening visits may present {{an opportunity to}} motivate mothers to have their daughters vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV). In preparation for a future intervention study, we sought to establish the feasibility of using these visits to identify women {{with at least one}} daughter in the appropriate <b>age</b> range <b>for</b> adolescent HPV <b>vaccination.</b> Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional mailed survey of women who had received breast or {{cervical cancer}} screening within the 6 – 18 months before the survey. The study was conducted at two diverse institutions: one serving a mostly black (54. 1 %) urban inner-city population and another serving a mostly white (87. 5 %) suburban population. Results: Our overall response rate was 28 % (n 556) in the urban site and 38 % (n 381) in the suburban site. In the urban site, the proportions of mothers completing mammography or Pap smear visits with HPV vaccine-eligible daughters were 23 % and 24 %, respectively. In the suburban site, the proportions of mothers completing mammography or Pap smear with at least one vaccine-eligible daughter were 41 % and 26 %, respectively. Conclusions: Women who undergo breast or cervical cancer screening in the two different demographic groups evaluated have at least one adolescent daughter at the appropriate <b>age</b> <b>for</b> HPV <b>vaccination.</b> An important implication of this finding in adolescent daughters of urban mothers is the potential use of maternal breast or cervical cancer screening encounters to target a potentially undervaccinated group...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The optimum <b>age</b> <b>for</b> measles <b>vaccination</b> {{varies from}} country to country and thus a {{standardized}} vaccination schedule is controversial. While the increase in measles vaccination coverage has produced significant changes in the epidemiology of infection, vaccination schedules have not been adjusted. Instead, measures to cut wild-type virus transmission through mass vaccination campaigns have been instituted. This study estimates the presence of measles antibodies among six- and nine-month-old children and assesses the current vaccination seroconversion by using a non invasive method in Maputo City, Mozambique. Methods Six- and nine-month old children and their mothers were screened in a cross-sectional study for measles-specific antibodies in oral fluid. All vaccinated children were invited for a follow-up visit 15 days after immunization to assess seroconversion. Results 82. 4 % of the children lost maternal antibodies by six months. Most children were antibody-positive post-vaccination at nine months, although 30. 5 % of nine month old children had antibodies in oral fluid before vaccination. We suggest that these pre-vaccination antibodies are due to contact with wild-type of measles virus. The observed seroconversion rate after vaccination was 84. 2 %. Conclusion These data indicate a need to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the measles immunization policy in the current epidemiological scenario. </p...|$|R
40|$|The highest {{incidence}} of meningococcal disease occurs in infants younger than 1  year of age. However, in the US, prior to June 2012, {{there was no}} meningococcal vaccine licensed for use in this age group. In the US, where both serogroups C and Y contribute substantially to the overall epidemiology of invasive meningococcal disease, a vaccine combining these capsular polysaccharides was developed. We review the newly licensed HibMenCY-TT (MenHibrix™, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium), a novel vaccine containing Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and serogroups C and Y Neisseria meningitidis conjugated to tetanus toxoid. We describe the vaccine, summarize the clinical trial data, and describe the patient populations recommended to receive HibMenCY-TT as their primary vaccination against Hib. Phase II and III clinical trials found HibMenCY-TT to be well tolerated, safe, and immunogenic when administered at 2, 4, 6, and 12 - 15  months of <b>age</b> <b>for</b> primary <b>vaccination</b> against both Hib and serogroups C and Y meningococcal disease. In October 2012, the Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practice in the US recommended HibMenCY-TT <b>vaccination</b> <b>for</b> infants at increased risk of meningococcal disease. HibMenCY-TT may be given concomitantly with other routine infant vaccines. It induces antibodies against Hib as well as bactericidal activity against meningococcal serogroup C and Y without {{increasing the number of}} injections required. As meningococcal disease epidemiology is dynamic, global surveillance remains essential. In the future, other countries may also benefit from the addition of HibMenCY-TT into their vaccine armamentarium against meningococcal disease. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Neisseria meningitidis group B (MenB) is {{a leading}} cause of {{meningitis}} and sepsis. A new vaccine has been recently licensed. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the epidemiology of MenB disease in pediatric age and define the optimal <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>vaccination.</b> All patients aged 0 – 18 years admitted with a diagnosis of meningitis or sepsis to the 83 participating Italian pediatric hospitals were included in the study. Blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were tested by Realtime-PCR and/or culture. One hundred and thirty-six cases (mean age 5. 0 years, median 2. 7) of MenB disease were found. Among these, 96 / 136 (70. 6 %) were between 0 and 5 years, 61 / 136 (44. 9 %) were between 0 and 2 years. Among the latter, 39 / 61 (63. 9 %) occurred during the first year of life with highest incidence between 4 and 8 months. A case-fatality rate of 13. 2 % was found, with 27. 8 % cases below 12 months. Sepsis lethality was 24. 4 %. RT-PCR was significantly more sensitive than culture: 82 patients were tested at the same time by both methods, either in blood or in CSF; MenB was found by RT-PCR in blood or CSF in 81 / 82 cases (98. 8 %), culture identified 27 / 82 (32. 9 %) infections (Cohen's Kappa 0. 3; McNemar's: p < 10 − 5). The study shows that the highest incidence of disease occurs in the first year of age, with a peak between 4 and 8 months of life; 30 % of deaths occur before 12 months. The results suggest that the greatest prevention could be obtained starting MenB vaccination in the first months of life; a catch-up strategy up to the fifth year of life could be considered. Our results also confirm that Realtime PCR is significantly more sensitive than culture. In those countries where only isolate positive infections are counted as cases, the incidence of MenB infection results highly underestimated...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} named: Vaccination refusing and its ethical coherence. The work {{consists}} of several parts. The first part is formed by theoretical possibilities. In this part {{we focus on}} the question of ethics. The basic question of this issue is a matter of imaginary dispute which also the ethics describes in its basic principles and which is the principle of nonmaleficence (not to inflict harm intentionally) and principle of beneficence (act for the benefit of others); and also the principle of autonomy and justice. This part further contains overview of compulsory and voluntary vaccination, a short description of each disease, side effects, division of the vaccines, principles of correct immunization and storage of vaccines, and an overview of reasons why the parents refuse vaccination given by the literature. The second chapter is the methodology. We set as a target of our work to identity and analyze ethical problems connected with refusing vaccination and to find out and describe the main reasons of the parents for refusing vaccination of their children. To reach these targets we interviewed twelve mothers and five pediatricians. The third chapter comprises of case studies, which shortly introduce the families, where the parents refuse vaccination for their children and briefly explain the problem in accepting children without vaccination by the pediatricians and society. There are twelve of these case studies. The fourth chapter includes results of the research, which were divided into three parts. The first part consists of reasons why the parents refuse vaccination for their children. There we analyzed five the most given reasons (side effects, different approach to life, composition of the vaccines, no occurrence of the diseases + small risk of infection, low <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>vaccination).</b> The second part is created by ethical problems connected with refusing vaccination {{from the perspective of the}} parents. During the interview we analyzed seven problems (truthfulness of the information, preventing from collective incorporation, denial of free choice, authority of the state, collective immunity, vaccination as a business, testing of vaccinations). In the third part there are the results of interviews with the doctors. After that follows the discussion. In the discussion there is a confrontation of the perspective of the parents, doctors, other specialists, and my own of the given problematic. In the conclusion I present an overview of the issue and proposals to think about and to the possible solutions...|$|E
40|$|These {{recommendations}} {{represent the}} first {{statement by the}} Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) {{on the use of}} a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine licensed by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration on June 8, 2006. This report summarizes the epidemiology of HPV and associated diseases, describes the licensed HPV vaccine, and provides recommendations for its use for vaccination among females aged 9 - 26 years in the United States. Genital HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States; an estimated 6. 2 million persons are newly infected every year. Although the majority of infections cause no clinical symptoms and are self-limited, persistent infection with oncogenic types can cause cervical cancer in women. HPV infection also is the cause of genital warts and is associated with other anogenital cancers. Cervical cancer rates have decreased in the United States because of widespread use of Papanicolaou testing, which can detect precancerous lesions of the cervix before they develop into cancer; nevertheless, during 2007, an estimated 11, 100 new cases will be diagnosed and approximately 3, 700 women will die from cervical cancer. In certain countries where cervical cancer screening is not routine, cervical cancer is a common cancer in women. The licensed HPV vaccine is composed of the HPV L 1 protein, the major capsid protein of HPV. Expression of the L 1 protein in yeast using recombinant DNA technology produces noninfectious virus-like particles (VLP) that resemble HPV virions. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine is a mixture of four HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L 1 proteins of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 combined with an aluminum adjuvant. Clinical trials indicate that the vaccine has high efficacy in preventing persistent HPV infection, cervical cancer precursor lesions, vaginal and vulvar cancer precursor lesions, and genital warts caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, or 18 among females who have not already been infected with the respective HPV type. No evidence exists of protection against disease caused by HPV types with which females are infected at the time of vaccination. However, females infected with one or more vaccine HPV types before vaccination would be protected against disease caused by the other vaccine HPV types. The vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection, and the recommended schedule is a 3 -dose series with the second and third doses administered 2 and 6 months after the first dose. The recommended <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> of females is 11 - 12 years. Vaccine can be administered as young as age 9 years. Catch-up vaccination is recommended for females aged 13 [...] 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated. Vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical cancer screening, and vaccinated females should have cervical cancer screening as recommended.

40|$|BACKGROUND Pneumococcal disease {{constitutes}} a major global health problem. Adults aged 50 {{years or older}} and younger adults with specific chronic health conditions are at particular risk for invasive pneumococcal disease, associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. In Europe, two types of vaccines are used in adults for pneumococcal immunization: pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV 23) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 13). The {{aim of this study}} is to provide an overview and compare the national guidelines for pneumococcal immunization for adults in Europe. METHODS In November 2016, national guidelines on pneumococcal <b>vaccination</b> <b>for</b> adults of 27 European countries were obtained by Google search, the website of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and contacting public health officials. In our analysis we distinguished between age-based and risk-based guidelines. RESULTS We observed great variability regarding age, risk groups, vaccine type and use of boosters. In age-based guidelines, vaccination is mostly recommended in adults aged 65 years or older, using PPV 23. A booster is generally not recommended. An upper <b>age</b> limit <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> is reported in two countries. In the immunocompromised population, vaccination with both vaccines and administration of a booster is mostly recommended. In the population with chronical health conditions, there is more heterogeneity according vaccine type, sequence and administration of boosters. Asplenia is the only comorbidity for which all countries recommend vaccination. CONCLUSIONS There is great variability in European pneumococcal vaccination guidelines regarding age, risk groups, vaccine type and boosters. For ease of implementation, European unification of the guidelines is needed. status: publishe...|$|R

Vaccination coverage was 60. 4 % among students aged 20 to 39 years (an <b>age</b> group targeted <b>for</b> <b>vaccination)</b> and 43. 8 % among those who did not belong to this age group. The most frequent adverse reactions to the vaccine were pain at the injection site (8. 7 %) and fever (7. 9 %). There were no serious adverse reactions. Among students aged 20 to 39 years, the most common reasons for refusing the vaccine were "lack of time" (42. 4 %), "fear of adverse reactions" (41. 9 %), and "difficult access to the vaccine" (11. 5 %). Other reasons for vaccine refusal were "uncertainties about vaccine safety and efficacy" and "vaccination was not needed". To increase the acceptance of the influenza vaccine, a comprehensive immunization program should be offered to these students...|$|R
