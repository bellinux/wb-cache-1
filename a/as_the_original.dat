5|$|After {{the release}} of the Pocket PC version, in 2006 Chahi created a new Windows version {{targeted}} at Windows XP. Emmanuel Rivoire increased the resolution to 1280×800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds. He found that his original choice to use polygons for the game characters enabled him to use the original character art at a higher resolution. The game still supports the original 320×200 resolution, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> background art (as an option), and it features twice as many checkpoints <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>original,</b> which makes it somewhat easier, as well as newly remixed sounds.|$|E
