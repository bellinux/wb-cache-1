25|$|In January 2009, AMD {{released}} a new processor line dubbed Phenom II, <b>a</b> <b>refresh</b> {{of the original}} Phenom built using the 45nm process. AMD's new platform, codenamed “Dragon”, utilized the new Phenom II processor, and an ATI R770 GPU from the R700 GPU family, {{as well as a}} 790 GX/FX chipset from the AMD 700 chipset series. The Phenom II came in dual-core, triple-core and quad-core variants, all using the same die, with cores disabled for the triple-core and dual-core versions. The Phenom II resolved issues that the original Phenom had, including a low clock speed, a small L3 cache and a Cool'n'Quiet bug that decreased performance. The Phenom II cost less but was not performance-competitive with Intel's mid-to-high-range Core 2 Quads. The Phenom II also enhanced its predecessor's memory controller, allowing it to use DDR3 in a new native socket AM3, while maintaining backwards compatibility with AM2+, the socket used for the Phenom, and allowing the use of the DDR2 memory that was used with the platform.|$|E

In releasing the budget, Ryan stated: [...] "We have to stop spending money we don't have." [...] According to the White House, Ryan's 2014 budget proposal would increase taxes on middle-class families by an average of $2000, while cutting taxes for the richest Americans.|$|E
500|$|Griffo's roman typeface, {{with several}} {{replacements}} of the capitals, {{continued to be}} used by Manutius's company until the 1550s, when <b>a</b> <b>refresh</b> of its equipment brought in French typefaces which had been created by Garamond, Pierre Haultin and Robert Granjon under its influence. UCLA curators, who maintain a large collection of Manutius's printing, have described this as a [...] "wholesale change... the press followed precedent; popular in France, [...] types rapidly spread over western Europe". Ultimately, old-style fonts like all of these fell out of use {{with the arrival of the}} much more geometric Didone types of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. They returned to popularity later in the century, with the arrival of the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E

2500|$|On November 12, 2006, {{beginning}} with the 11:00p.m. newscast, WTHR became the first television station in Indiana to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.

Much of WTHR's field video continued to be shot in pillarboxed [...] standard definition until October 2, 2007 when all video recorded and broadcast live outside the studio began to be broadcast in widescreen; video recorded by the station's news crews is shot, edited and broadcast in the 1080i resolution.|$|E

In 2001, the G20t was dropped and a Sport model was introduced. In addition to the prior G20t's limited slip differential and decklid spoiler, this model featured two-tone leather/suede sport seats, 16" [...] wheels, and a variety of minor cosmetic modifications. The 2002 base G20 received the 12-spoke Touring alloy wheels as standard.|$|E

[...] The interiors were given <b>a</b> <b>refresh</b> in 2011/12 {{with the standard}} class seats recovered in the existing red and blue moquette and first class done with a maroon moquette. In summer 2014, CrossCountry began removing the quiet coach designation from such vehicles in its Voyager sets, believing them to be outdated and take up an excessive amount of space on a four-car unit. It is retaining the quiet coaches on its five HST sets.|$|E

2500|$|First {{revealed}} at the 2011 New York Auto Show, the Taurus received <b>a</b> <b>refresh</b> for the 2013 model year. The body {{features a}} new front fascia and slightly updated rear fascia with LED tail lamps, {{as well as}} all-new wheel options. The SHO model features revised styling elements, with unchanged power ratings from its EcoBoost V6. [...] Refinements {{have been made to}} the 3.5 EcoBoost V6. Power in the 3.5L V6, standard in non-SHO models, is up to 288hp and gets 19/29 MPG in FWD models, while getting 18/26MPG in AWD models. There is a new engine option for non-SHO models, a 2.0L EcoBoost Inline 4 developing 240hp and 270lb-ft of torque while delivering a best-in-class 22/32 miles per gallon. All models received upgrades to the steering and braking systems to improve driveability. For example, Torque Vectoring and curve control has been added as standard, and controls the cars ability to glide around corners at higher speeds. Updates to the Instrument dials have been added, they are now fully digital and clearer and more colourful. MyFord Touch will also be part of Taurus's Sync system.|$|E
2500|$|Bistable LCDs do {{not require}} {{continuous}} refreshing. Rewriting is only required for picture information changes. In 1984 HA van Sprang and AJSM de Vaan invented an STN type display that could be operated in a bistable mode, enabling extreme high resolution images up to 4000 lines or more using only low voltages. Since a pixel however may be either in an on-state or in an off state at the moment new information needs to be written to that particular pixel, the addressing method of these bistable displays is rather complex, reason why these displays did not {{made it to the}} market. That changed when in the 2010 [...] "zero-power" [...] (bistable) LCDs became available. Potentially, passive-matrix addressing can be used with devices if their write/erase characteristics are suitable, which was the case for ebooks showing still pictures only. After a page is written to the display, the display may be cut from the power while that information remains readable. This has the advantage that such ebooks may be operated long time on just a small battery only. High-resolution color displays, such as modern LCD computer monitors and televisions, use an active-matrix structure. A matrix of thin-film transistors (TFTs) is added to the electrodes in contact with the LC layer. Each pixel has its own dedicated transistor, allowing each column line to access one pixel. When a row line is selected, all of the column lines are connected to a row of pixels and voltages corresponding to the picture information are driven onto all of the column lines. The row line is then deactivated and the next row line is selected. All of the row lines are selected in sequence during <b>a</b> <b>refresh</b> operation. Active-matrix addressed displays look brighter and sharper than passive-matrix addressed displays of the same size, and generally have quicker response times, producing much better images.|$|E
50|$|While Brichter was {{initially}} developing Tweetie, {{he wanted to}} add <b>a</b> <b>refresh</b> function to the application. Regarding other mobile applications of that time, he said “They all {{had to find a}} spot and just cram <b>a</b> <b>refresh</b> button somewhere. Usually in one of the corners in a toolbar bordering a scrollable list. That was the most valuable real estate for navigation and action UI, so using it up for something as mundane as <b>a</b> <b>refresh</b> button just seemed wasteful.” Brichter thus decided to create a different method of refreshing such that the valuable corner space could be utilized for something else. Although he initially planned to create <b>a</b> <b>refresh</b> mechanism that follows Apple’s platform conventions, Brichter’s work with pull-to-refresh resulted in a novel interaction new to Apple’s platform at the time.|$|E
