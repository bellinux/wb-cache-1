Unlike Kwai Chung, however, whose villages are part of Tsuen Wan Rural Committee, Tsing Yi Island has its own, Tsing Yi Rural Committee.

The airbase was originally designated to be used only {{in the event of}} war. By 1937, flak positions, ammunition bunkers and the runway had been finished. In 1938, five half-timbered buildings were erected to house the airbase company and the <b>administration</b> <b>unit.</b> The airbase was declared operational on 1 May 1938 even though further works were still necessary to install water supplies and refueling facilities. This construction continued until the summer of 1940.|$|E

25|$|Although {{never tried}} {{for the murders}} of Fleszar, Schell, Skelton, Basom, Kalom or Phillips, {{physical}} and circumstantial evidence exists in each case indicating that Collins had indeed committed these murders. For example, {{in the case of}} Mary Fleszar, investigators discovered {{that at the time of}} her disappearance, Collins had worked part-time in the Eastern Michigan University <b>administration</b> <b>unit,</b> and that his office had been located directly opposite the hallway from the office where Fleszar had herself worked. One of the personal items missing from Fleszar's body was an Expo 67 Canadian silver dollar she is known to have worn around her neck; this item was discovered in Collins' dresser when police conducted a search of his room. When confronted with this finding, Collins reportedly denied any knowledge of the existence of this item and insisted it had never been in his room; he had apparently neglected to dispose of this item as he had the personal possessions of other victims two days prior to his arrest.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{approach}} has been proposed to rank police <b>administration</b> <b>units</b> {{on the basis of}} their effective enforcement of crime prevention measures using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Clustering. The proposed approach will offer an effective mechanism not only to rank police <b>administration</b> <b>units</b> but also provide an evaluation tool to monitor the implementation of crime prevention measures at various levels of police administration. The paper discusses two major phases of the proposed approach. In the first phase, clustering is used to identify the crime zones and to form homogeneous groups in crime data. In the second phase, police <b>administration</b> <b>units</b> in a particular crime zone are ranked using DEA. The effectiveness of the proposed {{approach has}} been illustrated on Indian crime data. The comparative results of DEA with clustering and DEA without clustering are also given to highlight importance of linking DEA with clustering...|$|R

2500|$|In 1942 the British Army {{decided that}} an {{infantry}} brigade was needed in each division and on 27 February 1942 the next change {{was made for}} divisions operating in the Middle East; an armoured brigade would be replaced by an infantry brigade. The Support Group would be disbanded, while an armoured car regiment would {{be added to the}} division. For tactical reasons, the battle formation in the Middle East became the Brigade Group, the division would now operate two Brigade Groups. The armoured Brigade Group would have three armoured regiments, a motor battalion, an artillery regiment (including an anti-tank battery of 16 guns; either 2 pounders or 6 pounders) as well as its three batteries of 25 pounder gun-howitzers, a light anti-aircraft battery of 18 guns, a field squadron of Royal Engineers and various other <b>administration</b> <b>units.</b> The infantry Brigade Group would consist of three motorised infantry battalions, an artillery regiment also with an integrated anti-tank battery, a light anti-aircraft battery, Royal Engineers and <b>administration</b> <b>units.</b> The division’s headquarters was given more staff and signal units and a headquarters was formed to control the artillery. Due to some armoured regiments being re-equipped with American tanks, the establishment of the division could vary between 130 and 150 tanks. In the United Kingdom, the Brigade Group was not adopted but the Support Group was abolished and an infantry brigade was added to the division to replace the second armoured brigade. The two artillery regiments, the anti-tank regiment and light anti-tank regiment were placed under the command of an artillery headquarters <b>unit</b> while additional <b>administration</b> <b>units</b> were attached to the division. Further changes were made to the armoured regiments and anti-aircraft tanks were incorporated into the division bringing the established strength to 227 tanks; 26 anti-aircraft tanks, 18 close support tanks and 183 cruiser tanks.|$|R
