5|$|Design {{managers}} often {{operate in}} the area of design leadership; however, design management <b>and</b> <b>design</b> leadership are interdependent rather than interchangeable. Like management and leadership, they differ in their objectives, achievements of objectives, accomplishments, and outcomes. Design leadership leads from creation of a vision to changes, innovations, and implementation of creative solutions. It stimulates communication and collaboration through motivation, sets ambitions, and points out future directions to achieve long-term objectives. In contrast, design management is reactive and responds to a given business situation by using specific skills, tools, methods, and techniques. Design management requires design leadership to know where to go <b>and</b> <b>design</b> leadership requires design management to know how to get there.|$|E
