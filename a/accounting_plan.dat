40|$|In the UK and the US, <b>account</b> <b>planning</b> {{has come}} to be {{recognised}} as a major force in contemporary marketing communications. In the US, it has been boldly described as “the biggest thing to hit America since Doyle Dane Bernbach’s Volkswagen campaign”. Jay Chiat of Chiat/Day is quoted as describing <b>account</b> <b>planning</b> as the “best new business tool ever invented”. In Australia, <b>account</b> <b>planning</b> has established itself in many agencies as an integral component in the development of effective communication. But is it truly a “new” business tool, or is it in fact a strategy that has been staring us in the face since the advent of time?: communication, not just from the marketer’s stand- point, but rather from the consumer’s point of view. This paper explores the role of <b>account</b> <b>planning</b> in the Australian advertising industry, the origins of the discipline and where we are today. Through the eyes, ears and mouths of a number of this country’s leading account planners by way of a series of in-depth interviews, the paper investigates how <b>account</b> <b>planning</b> has developed to this point in Australia. It appears that the scale and nature of the Australian advertising industry mitigates against full acceptance of the UK model. Indeed, the UK model has met resistance from several areas, including agency staff and clients. Like overseas, it was found that agencies that had fully embraced the <b>account</b> <b>planning</b> concept stood apart from other agencies in terms of advertising effectiveness. The future of <b>account</b> <b>planning</b> in Australia may depend upon a consolidation of the <b>account</b> <b>planning</b> discipline by practitioners and acceptance, by clients, of its embedded value.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{document}} the history of accounting development in Madagascar over the last century. It reports the development and important events that took place between 1900 until the twenty-first century and discusses {{its impact on the}} development of accounting systems and practices in Madagascar. Design/methodology/approach – In order to do this it uses the Code of Commerce, 1807 to narrate the development in accounting regulation and the different accounting plans issued in the country over the last 100 years. Findings – Given that the <b>Accounting</b> <b>Plan</b> 2005 claims to have harmonized with the international financial reporting standards (IFRS), this paper analyzes the level of harmonization with the IFRS by comparing the Madagascar <b>Accounting</b> <b>Plan</b> 1987 and 2005 with the IFRSs to identify any missing issues which can be regarded as symptoms of disharmony. This paper concludes that <b>accounting</b> <b>plan</b> in Madagascar has been upgraded from an archaic system to a more global <b>accounting</b> <b>plan,</b> though there are still room for improvement. Practical implications – The study is grounded in the practical development of national accounting and provides lessons for developments in other developing countries. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} paper we carry out a revision, on a {{theoretical}} level, of the principal aspects that have a major influence in the international accounting harmonization process and which are the principal differences in the income statement in the different Spanish general accounting plans and {{the differences between the}} income statement in the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) for Small and Medium-sized Entities (SMEs) and in the General Spanish <b>Accounting</b> <b>Plan</b> 2007 for SMEs. During of the development of the paper we have analyzed the international accounting regulation and the pgc in relation to the SMEs that we think that they are fundamental in all the countries. We consider a first stage in which the directives were issued and the national regulations adapted to them. In Order to analyzing the different changes that have taken place the income statement along the history from the General <b>Accounting</b> <b>Plan</b> (GAP) from 1973 to 2007 in Spain. With the approval of the GAP Spain embarked upon the modern-day trend of accounting standardization. Summarizing in relation to the income statement we could have observed that there exist significant differences between both regulations being the most important is that in the IFRS for SMEs an entity either a single statement of comprehensive income for the reporting period displaying all items of income and expense recognized during the period including those items recognized in determining profit or loss (which is a subtotal in the statement of comprehensive income) and items of other comprehensive income, or a separate income statement and a separate statement of comprehensive income. If an entity chooses to present both an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income, the statement of comprehensive income begins with profit or loss and then displays the items of other comprehensive income and in the General Spanish <b>Accounting</b> <b>Plan</b> 2007 for SMEs in a single income statement where the expenses are aggregated in the statement of comprehensive income according to their nature. By the IFRS for SMEs an entity shall present an analysis of expenses using classification based on either the nature of expenses or the function of expenses within the entity, whichever provides information that is reliable and more relevant.

40|$|What {{began as}} the “account manager’s {{conscience}} ” {{has grown to}} be top-of-mind in Australian advertising today. <b>Account</b> <b>planning</b> is a hybrid discipline which uses research to bring the consumer voice to the campaign process during strategy generation, creative development and evaluation. In Australia, <b>account</b> <b>planning</b> is subjected to the “Vegemite Factor ” where planners are spread too thinly across accounts {{and much of the}} market is dominated by freelance researchers and planners. This unique environment has shaped many different perceptions of <b>account</b> <b>planning</b> in Australia. These are compared with an international definition of <b>account</b> <b>planning</b> and the current research. While many basic tenants of the definition are shared by Australian advertising professionals, the difference appears to be in the ongoing nature, team approach and level of commitment. In Australia, account planners seem to be more facilitators of the strategic direction, than directors of it. Instead of exerting a sustained influence across the campaign, most energy appears to be expended at the start of campaign development, rather than extending through to its evaluation...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{establish}} the account planner’s role and contribution {{in the creation of}} effective communication strategies for advertisers. <b>Account</b> <b>Planning</b> was born in 1968 in two advertising agencies in London, within the media and marketing context of that period. In the present circumstances, characterized by consumers’ protagonism and the need of an integrated communication, the account planner has acquired a more prominent role as the protector of the consumer. The account planner works to assure that commercial communication is based on in-depth research about the consumers and their characteristics. Thus, account planners add value to advertisers’ success because they are in charge of conducting correct brand positioning and effective communication strategies, focused on in-depth consumer knowledge. These theoretical reflections are more relevant when applied to the empirical study of the contemporary situation of account planners working in Spain, where <b>Account</b> <b>Planning</b> is a recent discipline. It was in the early 1990 s when the first advertising agencies adopted this function for the first time, however, in less than 20 years <b>account</b> <b>planning</b> has become a key department in commercial communication.
