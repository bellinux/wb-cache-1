40|$|A novel {{heavy-duty}} {{shock test}} machine is developed {{to satisfy the}} newly-built shock resistance standard and simulate accurately the actual underwater explosive environments with increased testing capability. The mathematical model for the shock test machine is created to predict its dynamic performance and analyze its mechanism. Then numerical simulation is carried out to evaluate the prospective capability of the shock test machine under different shock velocity inputs. The double protection system incorporating the stroke limit of the <b>accumulator</b> <b>piston</b> and the unloading circuit can effectively prevent the secondary collision in the testing process. The simulation results have demonstrated that the shock test machine proposed in this paper can produce nearly the same shock acceleration waveform as the new shock resistance standard BV 043 / 85 and MIL-S- 901 D. Moreover, this shock test machine can be regulated conveniently to adjust to {{a different type of}} equipment and be extended easily to suit more severe shock environments and heavier equipment. The proposed system configuration and associated mathematical model provide theoretical basis and useful design techniques for practical applications...|$|E
40|$|Conventional wind {{turbines}} are built with a mechanical transmission system, and all components are therefore situated {{on top of}} the wind turbine. By replacing the mechanical drive shaft and gear with a hydraulic transmission line, most of these components can be relocated {{at the bottom of the}} wind turbine. Especially for off-shore floating {{wind turbines}}, this is important, as this will make the floating structure more easy to control. For off-shore applications, the reliability of the wind turbines is also essential. The turbines are towed several kilometres from land, and maintenance takes both time and is dangerous. A wind turbine with a hydraulic transmission line will give a much more reliable system, as no mechanical gear is included in the design. The hydraulic transmission line enables the turbine and generator to be operated at different velocities. This creates the possibility of using a synchronous generator at constant speed together with a turbine operated at changing speed. By varying the displacement of the motor, the volumetric flow can be adjusted so that the turbine spins with an optimal rate. The advantage of using a synchronous generator in preference to an asynchronous one, is the removal of heavy and expensive frequency conversion equipment. The synchronous generator can deliver its power directly to the power grid, because its frequency never changes. At the same time, the turbine is rotated at an optimal rate, maximizing the effectiveness of the wind turbine. This thesis is concerned with the modeling, analysis and control design for a wind turbine with a hydraulic transmission line. The transmission line is divided into a high pressure and low pressure side, where the dynamics of the high pressure side are interesting. The high pressure transmission line is built up of a hydraulic motor converting mechanical power into fluid power. Then, the fluid is carried through a transmission line system with an accumulator alongside it, before the fluid power is reconverted into mechanical power by a hydraulic motor. The hydraulic pump and motor will be supplied by H&# 228;gglunds Drives, but they do not yet exist because of their large sizes. However, scaled parameters from existing pumps and motors are used instead for modeling and simulation purposes. The transmission line is modeled as a chain of helmholtz-resonators linked together. By dividing the transmission line into an admittance model and a hybrid model, two state space representations are found. This split is made because of the accumulator model situated half way down the transmission line. The accumulator is modeled by the movement of the <b>accumulator</b> <b>piston,</b> and the pressure of the compressed gas, which results in a non-linear model with three states. The dynamic parts of the system are analysed, that is the transmission line and the accumulator. Transfer functions for the two transmission line models are found, and the natural frequencies of the model are determined. A transfer function is also found for the accumulator, by first linearizing the accumulator model, and then finding the stationary state values. The accumulator is shown to include very fast dynamics, giving us a maximum step size when running simulations. The helmholtz-resonator models reveals that there exists a pressure wave in the transmission line, which is reflected at the transmission line ends. It also reveals, that when several resonators are linked together, unnatural higher frequencies develop, which act like noise during simulations. A control design is carried out for the wind turbine with a mechanical transmission line, to gain insight in the controller functionality. The controller is used as pitch compensation when wind speeds are above rated. A similar approach is taken when designing a controller for the wind turbine with a hydraulic transmission line. A pitch controller featuring both feed forward and feedback terms is developed, so that the pressure in the transmission line is kept at a certain maximum. Additionally, a wind speed estimator is developed, as wind speed measurements at the nacelle often are very contaminated with noise from the rotating propeller blades. Simulations are made of the accumulator, the transmission line, and the hydraulic pump and motor separately, before running simulations with the whole system connected together. Different motor configurations are tested with the hydraulic transmission line removed. This is because of the small step size imposed by the accumulator model. The different motor configurations include a single large displacement unit, a single high speed unit with small displacement, several small displacement units, and a single large variable displacement unit. Power delivered from the turbine is compared to the power delivered to the generator, and pressure is compared to the set point given to the pitch controller. The results are satisfactory, showing that there will be considerable losses from the hydraulic pump and motor. A turbine power output of 5 MW will yield a generator power input of approximately 4. 3 MW. However, because the transmission line pressure currently is 80 % of what it can handle (300 bar), the turbine power output could be increased. The total power fed to the generator would then be i order of 5 to 6 MW. The advantages by using a hydraulic transmission line, like lower maintenance and longer lifetime expectancy, seem to make up for the increased losses in the transmission line. </p...|$|E

The project deals with performance improvement of hydraulic rock drill machine manufactured by Atlas Copco Rock Drills. Atlas Copco Rock Drills AB {{is a world}} leading supplier of percussive rock drilling equipment for surface and underground applications. HOPSAN, a software developed at Linkoping University, provides an integrated simulation environment for simulation of fluid power systems. During the work, a HOPSAN model of a <b>piston</b> <b>accumulator</b> has been developed and its performance with a rock drill has been studied. Furthermore, the fatigue strength calculations of a <b>piston</b> <b>accumulator</b> has been {{made on the basis}} of stress analysis performed using the ANSYS software. One of the rock drills of valveless type, developed at Atlas Copco Rocktec Division works at higher efficiency than the conventionally used rock drills. But the problem with this type of drill is that the piston swings between two large and highly pressurized oil volume which causes strength problems in the housing of the rock drill. The aim of this work is to achieve the higher efficiency of the rock drill without having any strength problems. Therefore, some study and research is proposed to replace the large oil volume by one or two <b>piston</b> <b>accumulators.</b> This thesis work involves modelling, simulation, design and fatigue strength calculations of a <b>piston</b> <b>accumulator</b> and its implementation to the rock drill.

40|$|Our {{team was}} tasked to design an {{accumulator}} mechanism that will separate nitrogen and hydraulic fluid, {{with a maximum}} leakage of 5. 3 grams of nitrogen per gallon of hydraulic fluid in the system for a 10 year period. Since {{it has been shown}} in the past that accumulator designs cannot be proved purely by theory, creating a physical prototype as proof of concept was imperative. Our ultimate design should prevent nitrogen from leaking into the hydraulic fluid, have a long lifetime, a low complexity, and as low a cost as we can manage.

40|$|This {{report is}} based on the {{challenges}} FMC Technologies has due to measuring the amount of hydraulic oil inside a <b>piston</b> <b>accumulator</b> tank {{on the bottom of the}} sea. It is favorably to know at any given time how much hydraulic oil is left in the tank; in time some of the oil will be lost to the environment due to its function. There are several hydraulic accumulator tanks attached to a subsea Xmas tree, each operating on different system but perform the same main function, which is to send hydraulic oil to an actuator. The actuator uses the hydraulic oil as energy to open and close valves. Today FMC Technologies does not have any satisfying solution regarding this problem; rather they use prior experience of how long it takes before an accumulator tank needs to be refilled. In collaboration with FMC Technologies a solution to the problem has been developed for measuring the remaining hydraulic oil inside the tank, where a measuring system were put on the top of the accumulator tank protected by a housing. The critical issue for the system is an expected lifetime of 25 years. Several solution regarding a measuring system where proposed. A scoreboard criterion where used to distinguish out the best solution according to the requirements given by FMC Technologies. A detailed concept regarding the best solution where developed, which consist of a time-offlight laser placed inside a housing which is attached to the top of the accumulator tank. The housing must be able to withstand water pressure down to 2750 m (275 Bar). The bottom of the housing must be able to withstand internal pressure from the accumulator tank which is 345 Bar.

40|$|Blowout preventers are {{designed}} to shut in a well under pressure so that formation fluids that have moved into the wellbore can be contained and circulated out while continuous control of the well is maintained. Control Systems for the BOPs are of necessity highly efficient hydraulic systems. The objective is to operate functions, such as closing rams, on the BOP stack in as short a time as possible. Supplying enough volume of pressured hydraulic fluid to operate those emergency functions is essential. To have the necessary quantity of control fluid under pressure requires storing this fluid in accumulators. These accumulators operate by the expansion and compression of nitrogen gas that is separated from hydraulic fluid by either rubber bladders or <b>pistons.</b> <b>Accumulators</b> are used both {{on the surface and}} at the seafloor. As long as you use accumulators on the surface or in relatively shallow waters, you may not {{have a problem with the}} volume of hydraulic fluid capacity of gas charged accumulators. The problem may arise when the wellhead is at water depth of more than 3500 ft. In deep water drilling, the accumulators should be placed on the subsea blowout preventer stack to reduce hydraulic response times and provide a hydraulic power supply in case of interruption of surface communication. Accumulators are also used in subsea production control systems to provide local storage that allows smaller line sizes in control umbilicals. Hydraulic fluid capacity of an accumulator drops to 15 % of its capacity on the surface and even less, depending on the water depth. A large number of accumulators are needed to perform BOP functions that could have been done by just a few of them on the surface or at relatively shallow water depth. Gas inside gas charged accumulators does not behave like an ideal gas as we go to very deep water, due to high hydrostatic pressure at that water depth. The higher the ambient pressure, the more the gas behaves like a real gas rather than an ideal gas and the lower the fluid capacity of the accumulators. Compressed gas has energy in it, and can release this energy at the time desired, that??s why it is used in accumulators. Now, we have to look for something that is able to store energy, but unlike the nitrogen, its functionality must not be affected by the increasing hydrostatic pressure of water as a function of water depth. Springs and heavy weights will be discussed as two options to replace nitrogen in accumulators. Efficient deep water accumulators would reduce the number of accumulators required in deepwater and cut the cost of the project. With the advent of such efficient accumulators, we can hope that one of the numerous problems of deepwater drilling has been solved and we can think of drilling in even deeper waters...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The present {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with geothermal energy and specifically focuses on engineered geothermal systems (EGS), which are among a portfolio of technology options for power generation from geothermal resources. In this cyclic approach (also known as hot-dry-rocks or enhanced geothermal systems), high pressure water (i. e. "geofluid") is first pumped down a borehole (known as injection well) into a bed of hot fractured rock and forced to travel through the bed, capturing the heat content of the rocks. The hot water is then extracted from a second borehole (known as production well) and sent into a binary power plant, where its thermal energy is converted to electricity. The cooled water exiting the power plant is then injected back into the ground to resume the cycle. The aim of this thesis is to advance the understanding of CO₂ based EGS power generation process and verify the merits of using CO₂ rather than water for heat extraction from fractured hot dry rocks. The work has been largely driven by the suitable thermodynamic and transport properties of supercritical CO₂ (scCO₂), {{which makes it a}} desirable candidate for harnessing geothermal energy from hot dry rocks, particularly in regions where water resources are scarce. However, {{only a limited number of}} studies were carried out in the past to assess the viability of the CO₂ based EGS concept. Most of these studies were theoretical examinations of the heat extraction and exergy analysis under a limited range of operational parameters. In addition, research work on the fluid-rock interactions relevant to CO₂ based EGS is also limited and needs further investigation. The present thesis addresses the above knowledge gaps through a combined experimental and theoretical study, resulting to an accurate description of the entire CO₂ based EGS power generation process encompassing the reservoir, wellbore and power plant cycle as well as the fluid-rock geochemical interaction. The specific objectives of the project underlying this thesis were: (1) model development and simulation of the entire CO₂ and H₂O based EGS and the associated power plant cycles, (2) optimisation studies and sensitivity analysis of operating and design parameters affecting CO₂ and H₂O based EGS performance, (3) performance comparison of CO₂ based EGS and H₂O based EGS under the same operating and reservoir conditions, (4) examination of the effect of reservoir parameters on both CO₂ and H₂O based EGS concepts through detailed 3 D reservoir simulations, (5) design and fabrication of a fluid-rock interaction apparatus capable of simulating EGS conditions, and (6) experimental investigation of the fluid-rock interactions at reservoir conditions and its likely impact on the performance characteristics of CO₂ and H₂O based EGS. One dimensional (1 D), 2 D, and 3 D models of integrated reservoir-wellbore-power plant cycle were developed to provide an overall description of fluid flow in fractured reservoir (channel flow) and in radial fluid flow in homogeneous porous media. It was also created to investigate " 3 D effects" as well as transient changes during the power generation process. The thermosiphon power generation process was used in CO₂ based EGS model simulations while the Organic Rankine Cycle binary plant with isopentane as the working fluid was employed in the H₂O based EGS simulations. Mass and energy balance equations associated with the integrated 1 D and 2 D reservoir-wellbore-power plant cycle model simulations were solved using the Engineering Equation Solver (EES). In the integrated 3 D reservoir-wellbore-power plant cycle modelling, the transient geofluid mass and heat flow rates in the reservoir were simulated using TOUGH 2 /ECO 2 N software packages while the wellbore flow and power plant cycle calculations were carried out using EES. The use of TOUGH 2 /ECO 2 N was validated and calibrated by replicating the results of prior studies done by Pruess (2008) where TOUGH 2 /EOSM simulator was used. A fluid-rock interaction apparatus with titanium made wetted components was designed and fabricated to conduct batch and flow-through experimental studies of rock samples with CO₂ and H₂O at pressures up to 50 MPa and temperatures up to 400 °C. Surface granite from Moonbi near New England Highway, NSW and drill core samples from Mossgiel 1 and Nambucurra 1 boreholes at Murray-Darling Basin, NSW were collected and used as representatives of hot-dry-rock (HDR) EGS reservoir rock formations. The granite samples were pulverised and analysed for particle size distribution as well aselement (fused-bead XRF) and mineral (Rietveld quantitative XRD) compositions prior to any experiments. Fluid-rock interaction experiments were conducted for up to 15 days at different simulated reservoir pressures (20 and 35 MPa) and temperatures(200 and 250 °C). Fluid effluents were analysed using ICP-OES, and the reacted pulverised granite samples were subjected to further XRF, XRD, and SEM (scanning electron microscopy) analysis. The following are the key findings of the integrated 1 D/ 2 D reservoir-wellbore-power simulations: • The mass flow rate of CO₂ has an inverse relation with the injection temperature in a CO₂ based EGS while there is a direct relationship between the mass flow rate of water and injection temperature in CO₂ based EGS. These contrasting behaviours can be assigned to the fact that an increase in the injection temperature lowers the CO₂ density and hence increases its dynamic viscosity whereas in the case of water, an increase in the injection temperature lowers H₂O kinematic viscosity and thereby decreases the dynamic viscosity. • Reservoir pressure loss is generally higher for H₂O than for CO₂ because of the higher H₂O kinematic viscosity. • CO₂ overall mass flow rate is higher than that of H₂O due to lower average CO₂ kinematic viscosity at reservoir conditions. • Wellbore frictional loss of CO₂ is greater than that of H₂O due to the lower average CO₂ density along the length of the wellbore. • Heat extraction rates of H₂O based EGS is generally higher than those of CO₂ based EGS due to higher specific heat capacity of water. • The thermal siphoning is not practical for H₂O based EGS because the production pressure is usually lower than the injection pressure. • Power generation output of H₂O based EGS are higher than that of CO₂ based EGS and increases almost linearly as injection pressure increases while CO₂ based EGS power output shows a parabolic trend. These were found to be due to the dependency of CO₂ thermodynamic properties on pressure while H₂O thermodynamic properties are almost independent of pressure. • Reservoir temperature does not influence the overall CO₂ mass flow rate, but CO₂ heat extraction rate increases as reservoir temperature increases due to increase in the specific enthalpy change. • The maximum power generation of CO₂ based EGS decreases as reservoir pressure decreases due to lower CO₂ production pressure in the wellhead. • For both CO₂ and H₂O based EGS, shorter injection to production well distance gives higher fluid mass flow rate due to the increase in pressure gradient (pressure drop/distance) between the injection and production wells. • As the ratio of production to injection well increases, the CO₂ based EGS power generation output increases due to diminishing CO₂ frictional loss in individual production well as the number of production well increases. • CO₂ based EGS generally performs better in low permeability reservoirs (typically one order of magnitude decrease in reservoir permeability decreases CO₂ mass flow rates by 27 % while H₂O mass flow rates decreases by 67 %). • The overall thermal efficiency at any specified injection and reservoir conditions is constant regardless of CO₂ mass flow rate. Batch and flow-through CO₂-rock interaction experiments show that Ca, Fe, Mg, Al, and Si dissolve in scCO₂, which was found to be partly due to the presence of H₂O in the CO₂ stream leaked from the <b>piston</b> <b>accumulator.</b> Geochemical model simulations show that aqueous Si concentration is in equilibrium with the rock minerals after 1 day exposure in the batch experiment. The log of (Na/K) ratios shows the preferential dissolution of albite over k-feldspar. The SEM image analysis of the treated granites shows signs of erosion (i. e. rounded edges and pebble-like surfaces), which is considered to be due to the formation of carbonates in the surface and its subsequent erosion and dissolution (particularly Na₂CO₃ and K₂CO₃) to the fluid. The XFR analysis of the untreated and treated pulverised granites shows very small changes to SiO₂, Al₂O₃, CaO, MgO, Fe₂O₃, Na₂O, and K₂O major oxide compositions consistent with the ICP-OES analytical results. The Na-K-Mg ternary diagram of the data collected from the fluid-rock experiments shows that the aqueous fluid is far from the equilibrium. The presence and/or absence of minerals (hornblende or chlorite) in the starting material influences the log of (Na/K) ratios. Hornblende alters or converts to chlorite in the CO₂-H₂O mixture. Moreover, the concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Fe decreases with time, which is considered to be due to the formation of a passive layer of insoluble carbonate minerals in the surface, thus preventing further fluid-rock interaction. The pressure loss data collected during the flow-through fluid-rock interaction experiments validate the theory that CO₂ has lower reservoir loss than H₂O. The data also validate the correlation between particle size and intrinsic permeability, which predicts that at the same fluid mass flow rate, a medium with a larger particle size has a lower pressure loss...|$|R
