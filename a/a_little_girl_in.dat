5|$|Stephen Stickler {{acted as}} the band's photographer, and Jay Papke and Dante Ariola {{directed}} the album's cover art and booklet. The cover depicts <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> a purple {{dress with a}} matching bow in her blonde hair, bringing her swing to a stop to squint in the sun at the man standing before her. The man is only seen as a dark shadow on the ground, and is holding {{what appears to be}} a horse shoe or, more presumably, blades. The band's logo, a childlike drawing of the band's name created by lead singer Jonathan Davis, is seen on the sandy ground by Dark Shadow; the way it's positioned next to the girls' shadow makes it appear the latter is being hanged.|$|E
5|$|To {{learn about}} the Yeti, which he {{depicted}} as a benevolent creature, Hergé contacted his friend Bernard Heuvelmans, the author of On the Trail of Unknown Animals. After re-reading Heuvelmans' description of the Yeti, Hergé went on to research the cryptid species as much as possible. Hergé interviewed mountaineers, including Herzog, who had spotted the tracks of what he believed was an enormous biped that stopped {{at the foot of}} a rock face on Annapurna. The creature's care for the starving Chang derives from a Sherpa account of a Yeti that rescued <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> similar circumstances. Another influence came from Fanny Vlaminck, who was interested in extrasensory perception and the mysticism of Tibetan Buddhism, prominent themes in the story that also fascinated Hergé.|$|E

He manages to get Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) to join him in writing a song, with Andy singing an anti-war song from the {{perspective}} of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> falsetto.

500|$|While {{the film}} is shot {{primarily}} in black and white, a red coat is used to distinguish <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> the scene depicting the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. Later in the film, Schindler sees her dead body, recognizable only by the red coat she is still wearing. Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolize how members of {{the highest levels of}} government in the United States knew the Holocaust was occurring, yet did nothing to stop it. [...] "It was as obvious as a little girl wearing a red coat, walking down the street, and yet nothing was done to bomb the German rail lines. Nothing was being done to slow down... the annihilation of European Jewry," [...] he said. [...] "So that was my message in letting that scene be in color." [...] Andy Patrizio of IGN notes that the point at which Schindler sees the girl's dead body is the point at which he changes, no longer seeing [...] "the ash and soot of burning corpses piling up on his car as just an annoyance." [...] Professor André H. Caron of the Université de Montréal wonders if the red symbolises [...] "innocence, hope or the red blood of the Jewish people being sacrificed in the horror of the Holocaust." ...|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 6, 1910. It states: [...] "Hugh Logan is a widower who lives with his only child, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> <b>in</b> a small cottage in the country. Logan is a commercial traveler and, as the play opens, is preparing to leave on a business trip. He takes the train to the city, where he is attacked by footpads, who leave him unconscious in the roadway. He is found by Maud Neal and her father, who are passing in an auto, and they take him into their home. There he revives, but the shock has affected his memory, and {{he is unable to}} recall anything of his past life. The kindly Neal secures him employment, and as time passes Logan falls deeply in love with Maud. He finally proposes to her and it is accepted. In the meantime, little May has been waiting in vain for her father. As no word is received from him, and she has no other relatives, Bridget, the servant, takes her to the orphan asylum, where she is compelled to make her home with other little unfortunates. May dislikes the place. In the end she escapes from it. But, gaining the city, she gets lost there and, tired and hungry, goes to sleep on a doorstep - the Neals'. There she is found by Maud, who takes her into the house. Maud is much attracted by the child's charms and finally decides that she must never be parted from her. She tells Logan of her decision and he objects. They quarrel. Feeling himself in the wrong, Logan returns and asks Maud's pardon. He meets May, who recognizes her father. At the sight of her, his memory returns. Speedily he determines to retain May from out of the things of the old life, and Maud from out of the new." ...|$|E
500|$|Rebecca Mader's {{audition}} {{scene was}} a fake flashback {{and she was}} disappointed {{that it was not}} used for the show. [...] The character's name was spoiled months in advance of broadcast. [...] Charlotte was originally envisioned as an American; however, the writers preferred Mader's natural English accent to her fake American accent and they changed Charlotte accordingly. [...] Losts writer-producers compared Mader to [...] "a young Nicole Kidman". [...] During the casting process, Charlotte was described as a [...] "successful academic". [...] It was falsely rumored that Kristen Bell was offered the role of Charlotte; Bell had actually spoken to the producers about having a part; however, no role was offered to her. [...] Despite never having seen Lost, Mader decided that she [...] "was not going to leave [...] room until [...] made [...] fall in love with [...] ". [...] Mader subsequently began to watch the first three seasons of Lost and was watching the fourth episode when she received the news that she had been chosen for the role. [...] In the next two to three weeks, Mader– who was then signed on as a recurring guest star– watched the rest of the first three seasons, watching the third season finale a matter of hours before she began shooting her first [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] scene, in which Charlotte meets Locke and his group. [...] Mader was told little about her character by the writer-producers, except that [...] "she was sort of like a female Indiana Jones type". [...] Mader has found it challenging but fun to play a character with an unknown backstory and motives. [...] Charlotte's full name is Charlotte Staples Lewis, which is an homage to the author C.S. Lewis, best known for The Chronicles of Narnia and various books about Christianity. [...] Lewis was one of Mader's favorite authors as a child and found it [...] "wicked" [...] and [...] "cool" [...] for her character to be named after him. [...] Mader also enjoyed that she only requires a small amount of hair and makeup done, saying that [...] "I just wanted to rough it. [...] I wanted to roll around in the mud with a gun." [...] Mader claims that she has [...] "never had so much fun in [...] life" [...] as when she is shooting Lost. In the episode, Charlotte's birthday is said to be July 2, 1979. This led to a minor continuity error in the fifth season episode [...] "LaFleur", when Charlotte is depicted as being <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> 1974. Executive producers Cuse and Lindelof claimed in a podcast that the original script for [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] listed Charlotte's birthday as being in 1970 and that Mader had it changed because she did not want people to think she was significantly older than she actually is. This caused a controversy when Mader later stated on her blog that Gregg Nations, the script coordinator, was the one who suggested the change. Cuse and Lindelof later conceded that she was right.|$|E
2500|$|The first mechanically-propelled, two-wheeled vehicle {{may have}} been built by Kirkpatrick MacMillan, a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839, {{although}} the claim is often disputed.

On 3 July 2013, she released her long-awaited debut album, Once Upon a Time, to the Nigerian public. The album was released on iTunes a day before the Nigerian release.

2500|$|PV2 Frank [...] "Dim" [...] Dumphy (Luke Macfarlane) — [...] {{in spite}} of (or, more likely, in {{reaction}} against) his well-to-do upbringing and Ivy League education, this 22-year-old Cornell graduate deliberately chose a blue-collar, lower-class lifestyle. He was tormented by intellectual conflicts over the actions he is ordered to carry out, and maddened with worry over his pregnant, alcoholic wife and emotionally disturbed 7-year-old stepson. He has never pursued a commission {{because he does not}} want to adopt a leadership role. [...] His perspective serves as a contrast to emphasize the truly underprivileged roots of his squad mates. Probably the most sensitive character in the series, he was deeply disturbed when he learned that a particular insurgent sacrificed several men and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> order to get past a check point. He lacked a degree of street smarts which [...] "Smoke" [...] possessed as he has shown on some occasions, and does not operate prudently under pressure. It is unclear as to why he is a Private when his B.S. gives him an automatic promotion to Specialist. He carries an M4 carbine like his squad-mates, although his is fitted with an M203 grenade launcher.|$|E
2500|$|A motif {{within the}} second season {{is the image of}} a damaged teddy bear and its missing eye. The teddy bear first appears {{at the end of the}} music video [...] "Fallacies" [...] for Jesse's band [...] "TwaüghtHammër," [...] which was {{released}} as a webisode in February 2009 leading to {{the second season}}. The teddy bear can also be spotted on the mural on Jane's bedroom wall during the final episode of the second season, further connecting the crash to Jane. It is seen in flashforwards during four episodes, the titles of which, when put together in order, form the sentence [...] "Seven Thirty-Seven down over ABQ." [...] The flashforwards are shot in black and white, with the sole exception of the pink teddy bear, which is an homage to the film Schindler's List, in which the color red is used to distinguish <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> a coat. At the end of the season, Walter indirectly helps cause the midair collision of two airplanes; the pink teddy bear is then revealed to have fallen out of one of the planes and into the Whites' swimming pool. Vince Gilligan called the plane accident an attempt to visualize [...] "all the terrible grief that Walt has wrought upon his loved ones" [...] and [...] "the judgment of God." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 29, 1872, {{the gang}} robbed {{a bank in}} Columbia, Kentucky. One of the outlaws shot the cashier, R.A.C. Martin, who had refused to open the safe. On September 23, 1872, three men (identified by former bushwhacker Jim Chiles as Jesse James and Cole and John Younger) robbed a ticket booth of the Second Annual Kansas City Industrial Exposition, amid {{thousands}} of people. They took some $900 (...) , and accidentally shot <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> the ensuing struggle with the ticket-seller. Apart from Chiles' testimony, {{there is no other}} evidence this crime was committed by the James or Younger brothers, and Jesse later wrote a letter denying his or the Youngers' involvement. Cole was furious over this, because neither he nor brother John had been linked to the crime before the letter. The crime was praised by Kansas City Times editor John Newman Edwards in a famous editorial entitled, [...] "The Chivalry of Crime." [...] Edwards soon published an anonymous letter from one of the outlaws (believed to be Jesse) that referred to the approaching presidential election: [...] "Just let a party of men commit a bold robbery, and the cry is hang them. But [...] Grant and his party can steal millions and it is all right," [...] the outlaw wrote. [...] "They rob the poor and rich, and we rob the rich and give to the poor." ...|$|E

They receive an anonymous {{invitation to the}} Utah desert where they reunite with the Doctor—now aged nearly two hundred years since they have last met—and fellow invitee River Song. Amy witnesses the Doctor's death at the hand of an astronaut in an Apollo space suit, but they discover the Doctor also invited a younger version of himself, with whom they travel to 1969 Washington, D.C. to investigate strange occurrences involving the Silence, an alien race who cannot be remembered after they are encountered. While there, Amy informs the Doctor she is pregnant before attempting to shoot <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> an Apollo space suit, believing it will stop her from killing the future Doctor. In the girl's orphanage room, Amy finds strange pictures of herself holding a newborn baby. When the Doctor questions Amy about the pregnancy, she insists she was wrong and further investigation by the Doctor is inconclusive. Throughout their adventures, Amy is plagued by strange visions of a woman wearing an eye-patch (Frances Barber) appearing sporadically only to her. In [...] "The Almost People" [...] it is revealed that the Amy present since she insisted she is not pregnant is actually a Ganger [...] a duplicate animated by the real Amy's consciousness [...] while the real Amy is in the captivity of the eye-patched woman and about to give birth.
