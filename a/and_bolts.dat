5|$|Atherton, {{along with}} {{neighbouring}} Shakerley, {{was associated with}} coal mining and nail manufacture. Alexander Naylor was taxed on his goods in 1332, showing the industry was present for at least 600years. Encouraged by the proximity of outcrops of coal, iron was brought from Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Spain. A variety of nails were made, lath nails, slate nails, thatching nails and sparrowbills. The nail smithies manufactured ploughs and scythes; their products were taken by pack horse to be sold in Manchester, Denbigh, Clitheroe and Kendal. The nail industry developed into the manufacture of nuts <b>and</b> <b>bolts.</b> Thomas Blakemore {{was the first in}} 1843 and by 1853 there were eight makers of nuts <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> including James Prestwich and Robert Parker. Some manufacturers of nuts <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> made spindles and flyers for spinning machinery. Collier Brook Bolt Works on Bag Lane dating from 1856 survives and is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|Do-Ashiayana Manzil was a {{portable}} wooden house {{used by the}} Mughal emperors during their visits outside their capital. This was a double storied house built with a platform supported over 16 pillars, of 6 yards height. Pillars were 4 cubits in height joined with nuts <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> which formed the upper floor. This functioned as a sleeping quarter for the king and also for worship and holding Jharokha Darshan, and considered it an emulation of Hindu practice.|$|E
5|$|During a later court {{session on}} September 9, Takaesu {{attempted}} to submit medical evidence that Brown {{had suffered a}} back injury in 1999 and had a steel collar <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> inserted around his spine. According to Brown, these injuries {{made it impossible to}} for him to assault V. N. as described in the police report. The Naha court panel of three judges agreed to issue a decision as to whether the evidence was submissable at a later date.|$|E

5|$|For {{that entire}} day the Comanches plundered and burned buildings, draping {{themselves}} grandly in top hats and stolen linens. They tied feather beds <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> of cloth to their horses, and dragged them. They herded {{large numbers of}} cattle into pens and slaughtered them. One outraged citizen, Judge John Hays, grabbed a gun and waded ashore through the shallow water, and roared at the bemused warriors, but the Indians chose to spare him, believing him mad. He later found that he had waded ashore to face nearly a thousand Indians with an unloaded pistol.|$|E
5|$|On 26 February, {{an interim}} report {{published}} by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch outlined the current progress of the investigation. The report contained a single conclusion, that the immediate cause of the accident was {{the condition of the}} stretcher bar arrangement at points 2B at Lambrigg crossover, which resulted in the loss of gauge separation of the point switch blades. The stretcher bars (components that hold the moving blades of the points the correct distance apart) had been found to be disconnected or missing. Of the three bars, one was not in position, another had nuts <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> missing, and two were fractured. The points in question were facing the direction of travel of the train.|$|E

25|$|A socket wrench, more {{commonly}} referred to as a ratchet, is a type of wrench, or tightening tool, that uses separate, removable sockets to fit many different sizes of fittings and fasteners, most commonly nuts <b>and</b> <b>bolts.</b> The ratchet wrench was invented by J.J. Richardson of Woodstock, Vermont, receiving a patent for the ratchet wrench from the Scientific American Patent Agency on June 18, 1863.|$|E

WD-40 was invented in 1953 by Norm Larsen and two other employees at the Rocket Chemical Company in San Diego, California.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, for {{the first}} metamaterial, the nuts <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> are one split-ring {{resonator}} electromagnetically combined with one (electric) conducting post. These are designed to resonate at designated frequencies to achieve the desired values. Looking at the make-up of the split ring, the associated magnetic field pattern from the SRR is dipolar. This dipolar behavior is notable because this means it mimics nature's atom, but on a much larger scale, such as in this case at 2.5 millimeters. Atoms exist {{on the scale of}} picometers.|$|E
25|$|The entrenched Roman legions {{were then}} pitched {{in a battle}} against the Macedonian style phalanx troops in the centre with missile support {{in the form of}} stones <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> coming from the rear. The phalanx, unable to put up a full charge, engaged the Roman legions. Despite this, the Romans still had to contend against pike phalanx units with their own short swords. In order for the troops to use their short-sword they had to swat away the {{opposing}} pikes with their bare hands before drawing themselves near enough to attack.|$|E

25|$|Meccano {{was a model}} {{construction}} system that consisted of re-usable metal strips, plates, angle girders, wheels, axles and gears, with nuts <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> to connect the pieces and enabled the building of working models and mechanical devices. Dinky Toys pioneered the manufacture of die-cast toys with the production of toy cars, trains and ships and model train sets became popular in the 1920s. The Britain's company revolutionized the production of toy soldiers with {{the invention of the}} process of hollow casting in lead in 1893 – the company's products remained the industry standard for many years.|$|E
25|$|Early that evening, Tunny {{surfaced}} {{and headed}} {{away from the}} heavily traveled lanes she had been patrolling {{in order to assess}} her damages and effect repairs. Inspection disclosed considerable damage to the bow, ripped-up plating aft of the torpedo room, and sheared-off rivets <b>and</b> <b>bolts.</b> The torpedo room pressure hull was badly dished in between frames; and this damage in turn immobilized the bow plane tilting gears. The explosions had jammed the gyro spindles in the stern torpedo tubes, impaired the usefulness of sound and radar gear, and caused other damage visible throughout the ship. Sailors inspecting topside found fragments of the destructive depth charges scattered over the deck.|$|E
25|$|Unsurprisingly, {{security}} and fire protection were major concerns. Horrea were frequently built with very thick walls (as much as 1 m / 3ft thick) {{to reduce the}} danger of fire, and the windows were always narrow and placed {{high up on the}} wall to deter theft. Doors were protected with elaborate systems of locks <b>and</b> <b>bolts.</b> Even the largest horrea usually only had two or three external doors, which were often quite narrow and would not have permitted the entrance of carts. The arduous task of moving goods into, out of and around horrea was most probably carried out by manual labour alone; the biggest horrea would thus have had an enormous staff of labourers.|$|E

25|$|After graduation, Winick {{lived in}} an {{apartment}} in Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts, with fellow writer Brad Meltzer, struggling to develop Nuts <b>and</b> <b>Bolts</b> for UPS, while working at a bookstore. On January 1, 1993, UPS decided not to renew Winick’s strip for syndication, feeling it could not compete in the current market. Winick was unable to secure syndication with another company, {{and was forced to}} move back in with his parents by the middle of 1993, doing unfulfilling T-shirt work for beer companies. Winick had Nuts & Bolts in development with the children’s television network Nickelodeon as an animated series, even turning the human characters into mice, and proposing new titles like Young Urban Mice and Rat Race, but nothing came of it.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Adrian Bowyer of the University of Bath {{started the}} RepRap Project {{to develop a}} rapid {{prototyping}} machine which {{would be able to}} manufacture some or most of its own components, making such machines cheap enough for people to buy and use in their homes. The project is releasing its designs and control programs under the GNU GPL. The RepRap approach uses fused deposition modeling to manufacture plastic components, possibly incorporating conductive pathways for circuitry. Other components, such as steel rods, nuts <b>and</b> <b>bolts,</b> motors and separate electronic components, would be supplied externally. In 2006 the project produced a basic functional prototype and in May 2008 the machine succeeded in producing all of the plastic parts required to make a 'child' machine.|$|E
25|$|Inspection {{disclosed}} that the bombs had dished in the hull plating {{in the vicinity}} of the after torpedo room and the maneuvering room, causing a leak in a vent riser. Less than ten minutes after the Japanese plane had been sighted, the commanding officer decided to discontinue the patrol. Throughout the ship, sheared off valves <b>and</b> <b>bolts,</b> damaged meters, clocks, and gauges attested to the force of the bomb's explosion. In addition, all three radio antennas were down, a leak in her pressure hull had been aggravated, and Tunnys rudder action indicated possible damage. She set her course for Balintang Channel and surfaced late in the day on 2 September. Tunny continued to sight Japanese airplanes as she made her way to Hawaii. She completed this patrol on 17 September at Pearl Harbor.|$|E
