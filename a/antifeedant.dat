500|$|Many {{plants have}} {{developed}} effective defences against termites. However, seedlings {{are vulnerable to}} termite attacks and need additional protection, as their defence mechanisms only develop when they have passed the seedling stage. Defence is typically achieved by secreting <b>antifeedant</b> chemicals into the woody cell walls. This reduces the ability of termites to efficiently digest the cellulose. A commercial product, [...] "Blockaid", has been developed in Australia that uses a range of plant extracts to create a paint-on nontoxic termite barrier for buildings. An extract of a species of Australian figwort, Eremophila, {{has been shown to}} repel termites; tests have shown that termites are strongly repelled by the toxic material {{to the extent that they}} will starve rather than consume the food. When kept close to the extract, they become disoriented and eventually die.|$|E

40|$|In Sweden, {{the pine}} weevil causes damages for several {{hundreds}} of millions kronor annually. The discouraged use of insecticides has resulted in that other methods to prevent pine weevil feeding needs to be found. <b>Antifeedants</b> found in the pine weevil own feces is one such alternative. The source {{of the most active}} <b>antifeedants</b> in the feces is probably from bacterial or fungal lignin degrading symbionts in the pine weevil gut. The aim of the project was to analyze the pine weevil gut microbiota with the help of culture independent methods. DNA (including bacterial DNA) was extracted from both midgut and egg cells. The extracted DNA was amplified with PCR. A clone library was created by cloning the amplified DNA into plasmid vectors and transforming the vector constructs with chemically competent cells. The clones were amplified again with either colony PCR or plasmid extraction followed by PCR, and used for RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) and sequencing. Species found in the midgut sample included Acinetobacter sp., Ramlibacter sp., Chryseobacterium sp., Flavisolibacter sp. and Wolbachia sp.

40|$|Plants have {{physical}} and chemical mechanisms for defense from attack by animals. Phytochemical defenses that protect plants from attack by insects include <b>antifeedants,</b> insecticides, and insect growth regulators. Phytochemical options exist by which plants can modulate the fertility of the other major group of plant predators, vertebrate herbivores, and thereby reduce cumulative attacks by those herbivores. The success of such a defense depends upon phytochemical mimicry of vertebrate reproductive hormones.

40|$|SummaryContact chemosensation is {{required}} for several behaviors that promote insect survival. These include evasive behaviors such as suppression of feeding on repellent compounds, known as <b>antifeedants,</b> and inhibition of male-to-male courtship. However, the gustatory receptors (GRs) required for responding to nonvolatile avoidance chemicals are largely unknown. Exceptions include Drosophila GR 66 a and GR 93 a, which are required to prevent ingestion of caffeine [1, 2], and GR 32 a, which is necessary for inhibiting male-to-male courtship [3]. However, GR 32 a is dispensable for normal taste. Thus, distinct GRs may function in sensing avoidance pheromones and <b>antifeedants.</b> Here, we describe the requirements for GR 33 a, which is expressed widely in gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) that respond to aversive chemicals. Gr 33 a mutant flies were impaired in avoiding all nonvolatile repellents tested, ranging from quinine to denatonium, lobeline, and caffeine. Gr 33 a mutant males also displayed increased male-to-male courtship, implying that it functioned in the detection of a repulsive male pheromone. In contrast to the broadly required olfactory receptor (OR) OR 83 b, which is essential for trafficking other ORs [4], GR 66 a and GR 93 a are localized normally in Gr 33 a mutant GRNs. Thus, rather than regulating GR trafficking, GR 33 a may be a coreceptor required for sensing all nonvolatile repulsive chemicals, including tastants and pheromones...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Provision of {{food has}} always been a {{challenge}} facing mankind. A major cornerstone in this challenge is the competition from insect pests. While some pestassociated losses occur when the crops are standing in the farms or greenhouses, others are caused during storage in grain elevators, storage bins and granaries. These plant secondary metabolites may serve as repellents, <b>antifeedants,</b> phagostimulants or toxins against the insect pests. The worldwide trend to minimize the use of toxic substances on crops has led to several studies focusing on alternative post harvest technologies for crop preservation during storage. Studies of the use of secondary metabolites have been on the increase. This paper reviews some of the identified and isolated compounds from plant materials and their effects on numerous insect pests in post harvest storage...|$|R
