5|$|Organothallium {{compounds}} {{tend to be}} thermally unstable, in concordance {{with the}} trend of decreasing thermal stability down group 13. The chemical reactivity of the Tl–C bond is also {{the lowest in the}} group, especially for ionic compounds of the type R2TlX. Thallium forms the stable + ion in aqueous solution: like the isoelectronic Hg(CH3)2 and 2+, it is linear. Trimethylthallium and triethylthallium <b>are,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> corresponding gallium and indium compounds, flammable liquids with low melting points. Like indium, thallium cyclopentadienyl compounds contain thallium(I), in contrast to gallium(III).|$|E
5|$|Notable {{dishes in}} Sabah include the Beaufort mee, bosou, hinava, ngiu chap, pinasakan, Sipitang satay, Tuaran mee, tuhau, the bambangan fruit (mangifera pajang) {{along with many}} others. Apart from these, Sabah also {{features}} a number of snacks like amplang, cincin, lidah, roti kahwin, UFOs pinjaram and Sandakan tart and dessert like lamban, punjung and Tuaran coconut pudding. Every ethnic group has its own cuisine with different styles of preparing, cooking, {{and the way they}} serving and eating the food. Example of Sabah-based companies promoting dairy product and state drinks <b>are</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Desa Cattle, Tenom coffee and Sabah Tea. The indigenous people features a number of alcoholic drinks such as bahar, kinomol, lihing, montoku, sagantang, sikat and tuak; with the state itself becoming the third highest in alcohol consumption in the country after Kuala Lumpur and Sarawak. The English Tea House and Restaurant in Sandakan is another attraction promoting the British tea culture. Other international shops and restaurants such as for Western food, Middle Eastern food, Bruneian food, Indonesian food, Filipino food, Japanese food, Korean food, Taiwanese food, Thai food and Vietnamese food have their presence here. With the increasing number of tourists on the purpose of culinary tourism, this have since raise the local awareness on the important of local food to state tourism.|$|E

25|$|Greenlandic drum dances <b>are,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> {{relatives}} {{found in}} Eastern and Central Canada, based around a single dancer who composes songs sung {{by his family}} while he dances, usually in a qaggi, a snow-house built just for community {{events such as the}} drum dance. The men's drum dancing skills are evaluated by his endurance in his lengthy performance and the nature of his compositions. Drum dances are an important element of Greenlandic Inuit cultural cohesion, and function as personal expression, pure entertainment and social sanction.|$|E

Air is pumped through the blocks and the curtain of bubbles formed both oxygenates the liquor and also provides the necessary mixing action. Where capacity is limited or the sewage is unusually strong or difficult to treat, oxygen may be used instead of air. Typically, the air is generated by some type of blower or compressor.|$|E

25|$|Gossaert shows Antwerp {{influence}} in the large altar-pieces previously located at Castle Howard and Scawby. The bright and decided contrasts of pigment in colored reliefs are like Hans Memling, and the cornered and packed drapery are like Van der Weyden, while the bold but Socratic cast of face <b>are</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> works of Quentin Matsys. At Scawby he illustrates {{the legend of the}} count of Toulouse, who parted with his worldly goods to assume the frock of a hermit. His altarpiece of the Descent from the Cross with heavy double doors in Middelburg was admired by Albrecht Dürer before the church itself was hit by lightning. This is possibly the work now in the Hermitage, though Van Mander stated the lightning destroyed it and describes another Descent of the Cross in the possession of Mr. Magnus of Delft in 1604.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} psychology's fractionation, {{according}} to the ToK, {{is that there has}} been no meta-theoretical frame that allows scholars to agree on the basic questions that need to be addressed. As such, the different schools of thought in psychology <b>are</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> blind men who each grab a part of the elephant and proclaim they have discovered its true nature. With its novel depiction of evolving dimensions of complexity, the ToK allows scholars finally to see the elephant. In his 2003 Review of General Psychology paper, Henriques used the ToK System with the attempt to clarify and align the views of B.F. Skinner and Sigmund Freud. These luminaries were chosen because when one considers their influence and historical opposition, it can readily be argued that they represent two schools of thought that are the most difficult to integrate. Henriques used the meta-perspective offered by the ToK to argue how one can retain the key insights from each school of thought, identify errors and points of confusion, and integrate the insights into a coherent whole.|$|E

Defensively, he led the league's second basemen in putouts (304) and ranked third in assists (290) and fielding percentage (.911). Dunlap was the star of the Cleveland team in the early 1880s.

The next hymn stanza, [...] "" [...] (You who <b>are</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Father), the sixth stanza from Luther's hymn [...] "dealing with {{the sins of the}} flesh and Christ's mission to redeem humankind", is marked [...] "molt' allegro".

Dürr sees the expression of [...] "" [...] (fight and victory of the Son of God) over [...] "" [...] (weak/sick flesh) of man. Gardiner compares it to a trio sonata movement. He terms the last aria [...] "a berceuse of pure enchantment" [...] and compares it to the [...] "echo aria" [...] from part IV of Bach's Christmas Oratorio. The text [...] "" [...] (Also with muted, weak voices) is illustrated by a muted (con sordino) solo violin.
