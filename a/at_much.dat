5|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between {{the growth rate of}} newly metamorphosed juveniles from different altitudes and latitudes, the specimens studied being from Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France. At first the growth rates for males and females was identical. By the time they became mature their growth rate had slowed down to about 21% of the initial rate and they had reached 95% of their expected adult size. Some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on growing rapidly for a longer time. Adjusting for differences in temperature and the length of the growing season, the toads grew and matured <b>at</b> <b>much</b> the same rate from the four colder localities. These juveniles reached maturity after 1.09 years for males and 1.55 years for females. However, the young toads from lowland France grew faster and longer to a much greater size taking an average 1.77 years for males and 2.49 years for females before reaching maturity.|$|E
5|$|According to an IAU draft resolution, the {{roundness}} condition generally {{results in}} {{the need for a}} mass of at least 5 kg, or diameter of at least 800km. However, Mike Brown claims that these numbers are only right for rocky bodies like asteroids, and that icy bodies like Kuiper Belt objects reach hydrostatic equilibrium <b>at</b> <b>much</b> smaller sizes, probably somewhere between 200 and 400km in diameter. It all depends on the rigidity of the material that makes up the body, which is in turn strongly influenced by its internal temperature. Assuming that Methone's shape reflects the balance between the tidal force exerted by Saturn and the moon's gravity, its tiny 3km diameter suggests Methone is composed of icy fluff.|$|E
5|$|After {{considering}} {{pursuing a}} master's degree {{on the topic}} of hard science fiction novels as fascist literature, Gibson discontinued writing in the year that followed graduation and, as one critic put it, expanded his collection of punk records. During this period he worked at various jobs, including a three-year stint as teaching assistant on a film history course at his alma mater. Impatient <b>at</b> <b>much</b> of what he saw at a science fiction convention in Vancouver in 1980 or 1981, Gibson found a kindred spirit in fellow panelist, punk musician and author John Shirley. The two became immediate and lifelong friends. Shirley persuaded Gibson to sell his early short stories and to take writing seriously.|$|E

5|$|Around one {{in three}} {{subjects}} develops systemic symptoms; {{after a number of}} hours, or rarely, delayed for more than 24 hours. Symptoms typically include nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, agitation, headache, generalised sweating and hypertension. Other non-specific systemic effects such as malaise and lethargy are also common. Rarely, other effects are reported such as neurological manifestations, fever and priapism (uncontrolled erection of the penis). Severe pain usually persists for over 24 hours after being bitten. Symptoms of envenomation may linger for weeks or even months. Rare complications include localised skin infection, seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, or respiratory failure. Children, the elderly, or those with serious medical conditions are <b>at</b> <b>much</b> higher risk of severe effects resulting from a bite. Infants have died within hours of a bite, but adult fatalities have taken up to 30 days.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{a number}} of {{different}} drivers were considered, but the introduction of the laser a few years later provided the first obvious solution with the right combination of features. The desired energies were well beyond {{the state of the art}} in laser design, so LLNL began a laser development program in the mid-1960s to reach these levels. Each increase in energy led to new and unexpected optical phenomena that had to be overcome, but these were largely solved by the mid-1970s. Working in parallel with the laser teams, physicists studying the expected reaction using computer simulations adapted from thermonuclear bomb work developed a program known as LASNEX that suggested Q of 1 could be produced <b>at</b> <b>much</b> lower energy levels, in the kilojoule range, levels that the laser team were now able to deliver.|$|E

Adler's memoir acknowledges many people who helped him out in various ways. Eventually, with the aid in particular of Sonya's relative Herman Fiedlerâa playwright, orchestra leader, and stage managerâthe Adlers and the Grodners were able to take over the Prescott Street Club. There they presented generally serious theater to audiences of about 150. Fiedler adapted The Odessa Beggar from Felix Pyat's The Ragpicker of Paris, a tragicomic play written {{on the eve of the}} Revolutions of 1848. Adler starred in it, in a role he would continue to play throughout his career.|$|E
