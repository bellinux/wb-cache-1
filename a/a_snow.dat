5|$|Mullsjö Municipality was {{newly created}} in 1952. The coat of arms, granted in 1977, was {{proposed}} by the municipality's recreation committee, to market the municipality as a center for winter sports. The snow crystal is a relatively modern charge, and the modern tree-top line, called kuusikoro in Finnish, is reflective of the Finnish influence on Swedish heraldry.

5|$|Although it {{remained}} {{close to the}} United States coastline, its impact was minor. Beach erosion and light rainfall was reported along much of the coastline, although the precipitation was beneficial in ending droughts in South Carolina and New England. High waves destroyed one house in North Carolina. Damage was heaviest in New England, where several buildings were damaged and thousands were left without power. The passage of Ginny resulted in <b>a</b> <b>snow</b> storm across eastern New England, particularly in northern Maine, where it killed two people. In Atlantic Canada, the extratropical storm produced high wind and waves, causing damage to boats and resulting in power outages.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy {{up to this point}} in the campaign, <b>a</b> <b>snow</b> storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of the proximity of the enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth is {{well known}} for its variety of long-standing student traditions, many of which are {{centered}} on the Green.

The wintertime celebration of Winter Carnival sees the construction of <b>a</b> <b>snow</b> sculpture on the Green. In the springtime, Green Key Weekend is marked by concerts and performances on the Green, which until 1984 was also the site of fiercely competitive Green Key chariot races.|$|E

5|$|Increasingly, {{ski resorts}} are relying on snowmaking, the {{production}} of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through <b>a</b> <b>snow</b> gun on ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at ski resorts. This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases. Wet bulb temperature {{is used as a}} metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account. Snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption, thereby limiting its use.|$|E
5|$|Striding Edge is {{a notorious}} {{accident}} spot among hikers and scramblers. In winter conditions the climb from Striding Edge {{up to the}} summit plateau can involve crossing steep icy ground and <b>a</b> <b>snow</b> cornice, and {{can be the most}} dangerous part of the walk. Without an ice axe or crampons this presents a serious obstacle. In January 2008 two walkers died after falling from the ridge in separate incidents. Another walker died after falling from Striding Edge in May 2008.|$|E
5|$|The gardens at West Wycombe Park {{are among}} the finest and most {{idiosyncratic}} 18th century gardens surviving in England. The park is unique in its consistent use of Classical architecture from both Greece and Italy. The principal architect of the gardens was Nicholas Revett, who designed many of the ornamental buildings in the park. The landscape architect Thomas Cook began to execute {{the plans for the}} park, with a nine-acre man-made lake created from the nearby River Wye {{in the form of a}} swan. The lake originally had <b>a</b> <b>snow</b> (a sailing vessel) for the amusement of Dashwood's guests, complete with a resident captain on board. Water leaves the lake down a cascade and into a canal pond.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>snow</b> groomer is {{a machine}} {{designed}} to smooth and compact the snow, rather than removing it altogether. Early snow groomers {{were used by}} residents of rural areas to compress the snow close to their homes, and consisted of a heavy roller hauled by oxen which compacted the snow to make a smooth surface for sledging. With {{the invention of the}} motor car, snow groomers were replaced by snowplows and snow blowers on public thoroughfares, but remained in use at ski resorts, where they are used to maintain smooth, safe trails for various wintersports, including skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling. Snow groomers remained unchanged throughout the 20th century, with most consisting of heavy roller which could be attached to a tractor or snowcat and then hauled across the area to be groomed.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>snow</b> sweeper uses brushes {{to remove}} thin layers of snow from the {{pavement}} surface. Snow sweepers are used after plowing {{to remove any}} remaining material missed by the larger vehicles in areas with very low snow-tolerance, such as airport runways and racing tracks, as the flexible brushes follow the terrain better than the rigid blades of snowplows and snow blowers. These brushes also allow the vehicle to be used on the tactile tiles found at traffic lights and tram stops, without damaging the delicate surface. Unlike other winter service vehicles, snow sweepers do not compress the snow, leaving a rough, high friction, surface behind them. This makes snow sweepers the most efficient method of snow removal for snow depths below 10centimetres (4in). Snow deeper than this however can clog the brushes, and most snow sweepers cannot be used to clear snow deeper than 15centimetres (6in). A more advanced version of the snow sweeper is the jet sweeper, which adds an air-blower just behind the brushes, in order to blow the swept snow clear of the pavement and prevent the loosened snow from settling.|$|E
5|$|After {{damaging}} {{the instrument panel}} with a medical ointment and decapitating the scientist, who {{turns out to be}} an android, Jim escapes from the laboratory through the sewer. While searching for Sara, Jim trips next to the wheelchair-bound man, suspects and attacks him. After realizing that he caused a scene and doubts the man's involvement, he returns to the room of the woman, where he discovers she has captured Sara, now wearing <b>a</b> <b>Snow</b> White costume. The woman rambles about her time as a character princess and tells him how bad things happen everywhere, including the decapitation at the park. She again hypnotizes Jim with the necklace, but Sara pulls it off and smashes it, freeing Jim from her spell. He returns to his hotel room and puts his family to bed. Jim suffers with digestive distress, vomits up a large amount of blood and hairballs, which he recognizes as symptoms of the cat flu and realizes that Sophie infected him. He begins to panic and bleed uncontrollably in the bathroom. Elliot enters and Jim begs him for help, but he closes the door on him.|$|E

5|$|Chief Vanuatu, {{leader of}} the bigfoots, in {{recognition}} of the pair's actions, makes the Freelance Police members of the bigfoot tribe and tells them of a spell that will make the world safe for bigfoots again, preventing their capture by humans. However, the chief requires help deciphering the spell's four ingredients, and asks for Sam and Max's help. Eventually, they discover that the ingredients are a vegetable resembling John Muir, hair restoration tonic, the tooth of a dinosaur, and a vortex contained within <b>a</b> <b>snow</b> globe. Combined with a live bigfoot sacrifice—which Max substitutes for frozen bigfoot-clad Bumpus and Harvey—the ingredients cause large trees to spring into existence, destroying towns and cities and covering the bulk of the west United States in forest. Content that their work is done, Sam and Max take the frozen ice block containing Bumpus and Harvey to the carnival. Believing that Bruno has been returned to them, the owners give a large reward of skee ball tickets to the Freelance Police, who then spend the end credits shooting targets at a carnival stall with real firearms.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Superior Court Judge Jack Panella won a $770 bid on {{the auction}} website eBay to {{flip the switch}} {{and turn on the}} Peace Candle during the candle-lighting {{ceremony}} on November 27, 2009. In November 2010, Easton Holiday Committee Chairwoman Sandy O'Brien-Werner voiced doubts that the current candle structure would last until 2014 as previously projected and might need to be replaced sooner. She expressed concern at the cost of such a venture, claiming the Peace Candle cost $14,640 in 2010 alone for maintenance and operation and that an altogether new structure would cost at least $35,000. In response, six-year-old MaryElizabeth Soffera and eight-year-old Katie Dietrich, two cousins from Williams Township who loved the Peace Candle, opened <b>a</b> <b>snow</b> cone stand during a garage sale {{to raise money for the}} candle. They raised $23, which they presented to Mayor Sal Panto Jr. during a November city council meeting.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{results were}} {{surprising}} as the material excavated {{by the impact}} contained more dust and less ice than had been expected. The only models of cometary structure astronomers could positively rule out were the very porous ones which had comets as loose aggregates of material. In addition, the material was finer than expected; scientists compared it to talcum powder rather than sand. Other materials found while studying the impact included clays, carbonates, sodium, and crystalline silicates which were found by studying the spectroscopy of the impact. Clays and carbonates usually require liquid water to form and sodium is rare in space. Observations also revealed that the comet was about 75% empty space, and one astronomer compared the outer layers of the comet to the same makeup of <b>a</b> <b>snow</b> bank. Astronomers have expressed interest in more missions to different comets {{to determine if they}} share similar compositions or if there are different materials found deeper within comets that were produced {{at the time of the}} Solar System's formation.|$|E
