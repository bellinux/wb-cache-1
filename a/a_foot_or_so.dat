5|$|In the lower, broader {{part of the}} estuary near Avonmouth, {{the tidal}} surge {{advances}} as a slight roll in the deepwater channels and the water rapidly spreads across the sands and mudbanks. Past Sharpness, the bore begins to form and when it encounters the large left-handed bend at Hock Cliff, it crashes headlong into the rocks. Reforming, it runs up-river close to the Overton shore before crossing the estuary towards Box Cliff. As it rounds the Horseshoe Bend it keeps to the outside but it afterwards moves across to {{the eastern side of}} the river. Above Langney Sands, the river abruptly narrows to a hundred yards, the sands diminish and the channel occupies the whole of the river. Now the bore is recognisably the spectacular phenomenon that people expect rather than a swelling flood of water. From Minsterworth to Gloucester, the width of the river varies little and the bore continues unhindered, climbing the banks on the outer side of bends and breaking over shallow places. At Lower Parting, close to Gloucester, it splits in two to pass either side of Alney Island. Both branches encounter and overcome weirs and rejoin at Upper Parting, and the much diminished bore continues upstream. In particularly high tides the water may overtop the weir at Tewkesbury, and even the foot of the weir at Worcester may experience a rise in water level of <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tunnels were blasted {{through hard}} rock by {{drilling}} {{holes in the}} rock face by hand and filling them with black powder. Sometimes cracks were found which could be filled with powder and blasted loose. The loosened rock would be collected and hauled {{out of the tunnel}} for use in a fill area or as roadbed, or else dumped over the side as waste. <b>A</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> advance on a tunnel face was a typical day's work. Some tunnels took almost a year to finish and the Summit Tunnel, the longest, took almost two years. In the final days of working in the Sierras, the recently invented nitroglycerin explosive was introduced and used on the last tunnels including Summit Tunnel.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{centre of}} Gubbio has a decidedly medieval aspect: {{the town is}} austere in appearance because of the dark grey stone, narrow streets, and Gothic architecture. Many houses in central Gubbio date to the 14th and 15th centuries, and were originally the dwellings of wealthy merchants. They often have a second door fronting on the street, usually just {{a few inches from}} the main entrance. This secondary entrance is narrower, and <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> above the actual street level. This type of door is called a porta dei morti (door of the dead) because it was proposed that they were used to remove the bodies of any who might have died inside the house. This is almost certainly false, but there is no agreement as to the purpose of the secondary doors. A more likely theory is that the door was used by the owners to protect themselves when opening to unknown persons, leaving them in a dominating position.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly, <b>a</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away, {{she saw a}} {{patch of}} violently {{disturbed}} snow--snow stained a dreadful colour, a snow of scarlet crystals! Three strides and Trafford was in sight.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no use," [...] he {{said with}} a moan. [...] "Each step now is {{carrying}} us lower. I remember hearing some of the old hands say the abandoned drifts were <b>a</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> farther down the hill. We must be considerably below the deepest shaft." ...|$|R
60|$|Harry led {{him forward}} where the boat's sheer was higher {{and he could}} stand <b>a</b> couple of <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> above the water.|$|R
500|$|The burnt baby {{skeleton}} {{was built}} from scratch. Originally, {{the crew had}} planned on renting a real fetal skeleton, but the $3,000 cost forced them to make their own. Office manager Donovan Brown noted that, [...] "we got {{two or three of}} those adults skeleton models, cut <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> off a leg here and shortened an arm there, glued them together to a plaster model of a fetal skull we found, and put together something that worked wonderfully".|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Fawkes {{called the}} trolley his Aerial Swallow, a cigar-shaped, {{suspended}} monorail {{driven by a}} propeller that he promised would carry passengers from Burbank to downtown Los Angeles in 10minutes. The first open car accommodated about 20 passengers and was suspended from an overhead track and supported by wooden beams. In 1911, the monorail car made its first and only run through his Burbank ranch, with a line between Lake and Flower Streets. The monorail was considered a failure after gliding just <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> and falling to pieces. Nobody was injured but Joseph Fawkes' pride was badly hurt as Aerial Swallow became known as [...] "Fawkes' Folly." [...] City officials viewed his test run as a failure and focused on getting a Pacific Electric Streetcar line into Burbank.|$|E
2500|$|The chancel {{still remains}} in the east wing and has some reconstructed colonial features. It is on a {{platform}} raised <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> from the church floor. On {{either side of the}} window opening are simple rectangular tablets bearing on the left The Lord’s Prayer above the Apostles' Creed and on the right Exodus XX (The Ten Commandments) under which is printed the Summary of the Law. In the middle is a reredos, obviously of non-colonial origin with an opening for the window incorporated within it. It bears, from the top down: 1) a cross placed so as to intersect center of the circular window; 2) a truncated tympanum, 3) a square-columned pilaster {{on either side of the}} window, and 4) a bottom forming a flat window sill. [...] The chancel is physically separated from the rest of the church by [...] vertical panels a few feet north and south of the window openings and a rail with 8 turned balusters on either side and a central opening. There are south and north facing [...] seats in the space between the side panels and the outer walls, on the north a built-in slip pew and on the south a short bench.|$|E
50|$|Eilean Bàn now {{supports}} a pier of the Skye Bridge, built during the 1990s. Despite modern traffic <b>a</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> above it, {{the island is}} a commemorative otter sanctuary and houses a museum dedicated to Maxwell. Another memorial is a bronze otter erected in the grounds of Port William Golf Course.|$|R
60|$|The {{smallest}} of the pines rose two hundred feet above her; and they ran up until they dwindled to insignificance far aloft at the <b>foot</b> of <b>a</b> great scarp of rock that rose beyond them for <b>a</b> thousand <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> and then gave place in turn to climbing fields of snow.|$|R
25|$|Metal pattens were {{strapped}} on shoes {{to protect them}} from rain or mud, raising the <b>feet</b> <b>an</b> inch <b>or</b> <b>so</b> off the ground.|$|R
2500|$|In the WomensWallStreet articles, Jacobsen {{detailed}} the activity {{she took to}} be suspicious. She claimed that before boarding, the men did not interact or seem {{to be part of}} a group. [...] Further, she claimed that during boarding, each man made eye contact with each of the others and nodded as if in agreement. One man, who wore an orthopedic shoe, complained loudly, just before takeoff, that he needed to switch seats. Once in flight, one of the men took a large McDonald's bag to a lavatory, exiting with the bag nearly empty, and giving the thumbs up sign as he passed two other suspicious men. Some of the other men also took objects with them to the lavatory, such as a mass of cloth, a camera, and a cell phone. Throughout the flight, the men would get up in unison, walk to the lavatories, and congregate in the aisles in groups of two and three. One of the men, wearing a suit and sunglasses, stood <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away from the cockpit door. When the captain announced clearance for landing, seven of the men stood in unison and went to the lavatory, each taking about four minutes. The last man to exit the lavatory supposedly dragged his forefinger across his neck as he passed one of the other men, mouthing the word [...] "No." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But Mr.--Mr. Lee--listen to me, will you?" [...] {{burst out}} Neale. [...] "It's all {{here in my}} notes. You've hurried over the line and you just slipped up <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> in your {{observations}} of that section." ...|$|E
60|$|In another instant {{we were at}} {{the edge}} of the cliff, and <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> below us was spread the dense, impenetrable blanket of mist. I stopped and hesitated, for the next step might be my last.|$|E
5000|$|The {{system used}} the track itself, or lineside {{telegraph}} wires, as the [...] "shore" [...] transmitter. The trainphone signal — low frequency current {{in the hundreds}} of kilohertz — was passed through the track or wires and induced a corresponding current in the locomotive or car's receiving antenna. The range was only <b>a</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> but this was sufficient.|$|R
50|$|The {{ferry boat}} story {{changed over time}} more often than the Lost Galleon story. One {{incarnation}} said that a small ferry (a two-man sweep) was built away from the river in a place <b>a</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> above sea level, where a source of wood was found, and that a team of six (or more) oxen perished hauling it through the sand near Los Algodones.|$|R
60|$|And yet observe: that thin, scraggy, filthy, mangy, miserable cloud, for all {{the depth}} of it, can't turn the sun red, as a good, business-like fog does with <b>a</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of itself. By the plague-wind every breath of air you draw is polluted, half round the world; in a London fog the air itself is pure, though you choose to mix up dirt with it, and choke {{yourself}} with your own nastiness.|$|R
60|$|He {{opened the}} door {{suddenly}} quite wide, but he made no motion to depart. On the contrary two men, who must have been standing within <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of it, stepped quickly in. Phineas Duge closed the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but it's lots of fun, if it IS strange," [...] remarked {{the small}} {{voice of the}} kitten, and Dorothy turned to find her pet walking in the air <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away {{from the edge of}} the roof.|$|E
60|$|The indefatigable {{stage manager}} ran {{in and out}} among us while we sang, driving this couple back <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> this other forward, herding this group closer together, {{throughout}} another making space, suggesting {{the idea of a}} sheep-dog at work.|$|E
6000|$|... "O Lady, {{it is not}} so {{difficult}} as it looks. A few steps across the gulf, and then <b>a</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> along the tail of the lion which is flat on the top and so broad that one may run down it if careful to follow the curves, that is on a still day--nothing more. But, of course, if the Lord Orme is afraid, which I did not think who have heard so much of his courage----" [...] and the rogue shrugged his shoulders and paused.|$|R
60|$|There {{were three}} or four men in morions behind Don Miguel, and Lord Julian {{realized}} the position. He released his hilt, and <b>a</b> couple of <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of steel slid softly back into the scabbard. But Don Miguel smiled, with a flash of white teeth behind his grizzled beard, {{and held out his}} hand.|$|R
50|$|Four {{pilots were}} killed in Cropmasters. In 1961 at Deniliquin, Ralph Dennis ran a tank dry in Marshall's VH-MSS and spun in. In 1964 John Waddell pranged VH-BAQ near Boorowa while doing low level aerobatics. In 1965 Air-Culture's VH-CXQ, with Richard Adams flying, struck a tree whilst {{entering}} a spray run at Highbury near Narrogin. Also in 1965 Bill Pearson flying Bender's VH-RPB at Kempton went in from <b>a</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> just after lift-off. Non-fatal misadventures included wire strike, jammed elevators after fence strike, getting trapped in a blind gully, Hartzell propeller blade failures and nose-overs.|$|R
6000|$|... "You missed me twice," [...] {{he began}} coolly, {{shifting}} both pistols to one hand. [...] "The last time within <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> By every rule of single combat your life belongs to me. That {{does not mean}} that I want to take it now." ...|$|E
60|$|The big {{weighing}} machines {{had been}} pushed into corners, and all round the sloping walls swords, cullivers and muskets were piled in orderly array, also a row of iron boxes standing <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> apart from one another and away from any other objects in the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{heart and}} lungs! I never {{see such a}} boy," [...] so I present Carshot's refrain; and {{even when he was}} within <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of the customer's face the disciplined ear of Kipps would still at times develop a featureless, {{intercalary}} murmur into--well, [...] "my heart and lungs!" ...|$|E
60|$|The two {{men stood}} upon {{the top of}} a bank {{bordering}} the rough road which led to the sea. They were listening to the lark, which had risen fluttering from their <b>feet</b> <b>a</b> moment <b>or</b> <b>so</b> ago, and was circling now above their heads. Mannering, with a quiet smile, pointed upwards.|$|R
60|$|There are orange-trees {{laden with}} fruit: who knows not them? and that awkward-boughed tree, with huge green fruit, and deeply-cut leaves <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> more across--leaves <b>so</b> grand that, {{as one of}} our party often suggested, their form ought to be {{introduced}} into architectural ornamentation, and {{to take the place of}} the Greek acanthus, which they surpass in beauty--that is, of course, a Bread- fruit tree.|$|R
60|$|Gale {{lay back}} and rested {{for a while}} without note of {{anything}} except the blue sky. Then he sat up. He was amazed to find that after that wonderful climb he was only <b>a</b> thousand <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> above the valley. Judged {{by the nature of}} his effort, he would have said he had climbed a mile. The village lay beneath him, with its new adobe structures and tents and buildings in bright contrast with the older habitations. He saw the green alfalfa fields, and Belding's white horses, looking very small and motionless. He pleased himself by imagining he could pick out Blanco Sol. Then his gaze swept on to the river.|$|R
6000|$|And then, finding {{he could}} not {{possibly}} intercept her, he hurled his mallet {{with all his might}} and main, and out it shot in a gracious curve within <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of Master Skelmersdale's head and through the glass lantern of the conservatory. Smash! The new conservatory! The Vicar's wife's beautiful new conservatory! ...|$|E
60|$|In an instant, however, {{he was up}} and at me again. Again our swords clashed--but once only. It {{was time}} to finish. With a {{vigorous}} disengagement I got past his feeble guard and sent my blade into him full {{in the middle of}} his chest and out again at his back until <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of glittering steel protruded.|$|E
6000|$|General D'Hubert uncocked the pistols carefully. This {{proceeding}} {{was observed}} with mixed feelings {{by the other}} general. [...] "You missed me twice," [...] the victor said, coolly, shifting both pistols to one hand; [...] "the last time within <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> By every rule of single combat your life belongs to me. That {{does not mean that}} I want to take it now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So, {{with true}} alii-authority of command, saying, 'You will {{immediately}} follow after me,' I dived in. Everything {{he had said}} was correct. I found {{the entrance to the}} subterranean passage, swam carefully through it, cutting my shoulder once on the lava- sharp roof, and emerged in the darkness and air. But before I could count thirty, he broke water beside me, rested his hand on my arm to make sure of me, and directed me to swim ahead of him for the matter of <b>a</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> Then we touched bottom and climbed out on the rocks. And still no light, and I remember I was glad that our altitude was too high for centipedes.|$|R
60|$|At {{two o'clock}} matters {{were about the}} same. I was not tired, but {{certainly}} the fish was not tired, either. He came to the surface just {{about as much as}} he sounded. I had no difficulty at all in getting back the line he took, at least all save <b>a</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> When I tried to lead him or lift him--then I got his point of view. He would not budge an inch. There seemed nothing to do but let him work on the drag, and when he had pulled out <b>a</b> few hundred <b>feet</b> of line we ran up on him and I reeled in the line. Now and then I put all the strain I could on the rod and worked him that way.|$|R
60|$|We {{stood on}} the edge of a sort of plateau. At our <b>feet</b> was <b>a</b> small ravine or valley, {{dividing}} us from another plateau, which extended to the foot of Fahla and Salamgi. This plateau was <b>a</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> below the spot upon which we stood, and would have been completely commanded by our guns. This plateau was bounded both to the right and left by ravines, the one to the left being the head of the valley in which was our baggage. The little valley which divided us from the plateau widened out to the left, the spot where it fell into the main valley being half a mile distant; and here we could see the spot where our baggage would arrive when it had climbed up from the valley beneath.|$|R
