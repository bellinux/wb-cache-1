Anne had Down's {{syndrome}} {{and died of}} pneumonia {{at the age of}} 20.

25|$|Also in 2011, Jawbone {{announced}} (and {{then paused}} production) of its lifestyle tracking system, UP by Jawbone. The UP wristband and accompanying app was first {{announced at the}} TED conference in Scotland in July 2011. Describing the company’s foray into health, Rahman told TechCrunch, “It seems like a big departure, but once we start talking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> {{it takes to make}} this whole category work, we get into things like making it tiny, having a long battery life, making it fashionable, making it waterproof, working with smartphones, having a rich, visual experience on your smartphone and making it social. This is all stuff we do anyway. It comes back around to the mission of your mobile lifestyle.” Highly anticipated by Jawbone fans and the media, the UP lifestyle tracker and app system launched in November 2011. FastCompany Design reported, “If UP works, it could augur a huge shift in the way we approach weight loss and staying healthy.” Jawbone halted production of the product a month later in response to widespread customer claims of issues with charging, syncing, and in some cases, product failure. The guarantee, offered purchasers of UP full refunds for any reason, even if they wanted to keep their wristbands.|$|E

Here 'illusion' {{does not mean that}} the world is not real and simply a figment of the human imagination. Maya means that the world is not as it seems; the world that one experiences is misleading as far as its true nature is concerned." [...] According to Wendy Doniger, [...] "to say that the universe is an illusion (māyā) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. Māyā not only deceives people <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge." ...|$|E

[...] His work experiences opened his eyes to see the world in a broader, more open-minded way and provided material for the songs he was beginning to write. [...] Early in his career Paul promised himself that he would always write <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> he knew well. In her review of Ellis Paul Live for the Folk and Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said, [...] "His finely honed songs tell stories filled with images that sparkle like jewels.

Marqusee describes the song as one of [...] "the purest songs of protest ever sung", as it looks at the media and its inability to understand both the singer and his work. He writes that the song became the anthem of an in-group, [...] "disgusted by the old, excited by the new... elated by their discovery of others who shared their feelings", with its refrain [...] "Something is happening here/ But you don't know what it is/ Do you, Mr Jones?" [...] epitomizing the [...] "hip exclusivity" [...] of the burgeoning counterculture. Robert Shelton describes the song's central character, Mr Jones, as [...] "one of Dylan's greatest archetypes", characterizing him as [...] "a Philistine... superficially educated and well bred but not very smart <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that count".|$|E

[...] Webb went on to add that the reason Key is sprinting through Los Angeles, once again, is not bad guys that are after him, it is his [...] "own personal demons".

I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it.

[...] Benioff continued, [...] "Every kid that grows up in Westeros, they all hear about this legendary sword fight that took place twenty years ago, and as far as Bran knew, it was just his father beat this legendary guy." [...] Weiss also stated [...] "Honor was so important to Ned Stark that it was worth losing his own life for, but he was completely ready to let go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important. It could make a very, very strong defense for Ned doing what he did, and it certainly does puncture the mythology of Ned Stark that's running through this world, especially after his death." ...|$|E

Among his more famous works is the 1962 authoring and illustration of Arms and Equipment of the Civil War. Dale E. Biever, registrar at the Civil War Library and Museum in Philadelphia, described the work as [...] "not about generals or battles but <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> one should know before delving into those areas...a welcome addition to any Civil War library." [...] It was republished several times, most recently in 2004. In 1966, Coggins wrote and illustrated The Horseman's Bible, which sold over 500,000copies with a revised edition published in 1984. In this book Coggins acknowledges his father [...] "whose twenty five years in the cavalry and lifetime interest in horses made his advice invaluable." [...] Coggins's last book was Marine Painter's Guide, which was first published in 1983. After the book was published, he decided to stop writing to concentrate more on painting. A new edition of Marine Painter's Guide was published in 2005 by Dover Publications, the publisher of new editions for several of his books.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} of Enough wanted Lopez {{to write a}} new song for the film. According to Lopez, writing a song is something that cannot be forced; [...] "It kinda just has to happen". While on their honeymoon in October 2001, Cris Judd played Lopez a melody that he had written on the piano. She thought that the melody was [...] "really beautiful" [...] {{and that it would}} make a [...] "wonderful song". Lopez felt that a [...] "little bit of it sounded like the movie, a little haunting". When she heard the melody, Lopez said to herself: [...] "I can write something to that right now. And we can use it in Enough". She then began to think about the film and the character that she portrays and what she had been through. In addition, she also thought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that she had gone through in her own life. According to Lopez, it was easy to be inspired by the melody Judd had written, [...] "and just kind of that grateful feeling, to just be here [...] And keeping it simple. Because life can get so crazy and everything. And then you realize, it's all just kinda about the simplicity of being here, and being healthy. And being alive.

500|$|American Life is {{suffused with}} Ahmadzaï's {{characteristic}} production techniques, like stuttering instruments and vocals, oscillating loop tones recalling 1950s Sonar pulses, morphing vocals consisting of grunts and squeals and treatments {{that make the}} music freeze in between rhythms. The producer hoped that using stuttering would become a rage in the future world of recording. He believed that people think it is not natural to skip and stutter the music. But he used it {{to create a new}} groove. With the help of Pro Tools, he froze the audio at any point he wanted to change the rhythm of the tracks. Madonna discussed the recording of the title track stating that Ahmadzaï had encouraged her to rap spontaneously, about all the materialistic objects that she herself had been using and doing. They had an instrumental breakdown in [...] "American Life", where the producer encouraged Madonna to add a rap about her everyday life. [...] "Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that I like'.

500|$|William Hutchinson {{was highly}} {{successful}} in his mercantile business {{and brought a}} considerable estate with him to New England, arriving in Boston {{in the late summer}} of 1634. The Hutchinson family purchased a half-acre lot on the Shawmut Peninsula, now downtown Boston. [...] Here they had a house built, one of the largest on the peninsula, with a timber frame and at least two stories. [...] (The house stood until October 1711, when it was consumed in the great fire of Boston, after which the Old Corner Bookstore was built on the site.) The Hutchinsons soon were granted Taylor's Island in the Boston harbour, where they grazed their sheep, and they also acquired 600 acres of land at Mount Wollaston, [...] south of Boston in the area that later became Quincy. [...] Once established, William Hutchinson continued to prosper in the cloth trade, and made land purchases and investments. He became a town selectman and deputy to the General Court. Anne Hutchinson likewise fit into her new home with ease, devoting many hours to those who were ill or in need. [...] She became an active midwife, and while tending to women in childbirth, she provided them with spiritual advice. [...] Magistrate John Winthrop noted that [...] "her ordinary talke was <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> of the Kingdome of God," [...] and [...] "her usuall conversation was in the way of righteousness and kindnesse." ...|$|E
500|$|Although he did {{not focus}} less on Christian lyrical {{material}} for Undone, mainstream radio was on Millard's mind when he wrote the lyrics on the album. Millard attempted to write lyrics that, while still focused on God, tapped into the things people deal with every day. Further, he avoided using Christian jargon, as {{people who are not}} churchgoers might not understand what those terms mean; instead, he tried to be [...] "clearer in the things [...] were talking about". Another impact on the songwriting was the band's experiences over the previous year; while working on Undone, Millard and {{the other members of the}} band lost eight people close to them. Millard noted that [...] "There's a lot of personal stuff on [...] <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> we've gone through and how Christ has been the solution". One particular song, [...] "Homesick", was written after two incidents. The first incident occurred during the holiday season of 2004; a friend of Millard's lost her twin babies during pregnancy and was so far along in the pregnancy that doctors had to induce labor. After attending the funeral for the two babies, Millard wrote the chorus to the song. However, he didn't write any more to [...] "Homesick" [...] after that as {{he did not}} want to [...] "fake" [...] his way through writing it. Following the death of his brother-in-law Chris, however, Millard finished the song. Although Undone was [...] "essentially complete" [...] at that point, the band recorded and included it on the album.|$|E
