25|$|Some {{existing}} {{research focuses on}} the ways that political campaigns, parties, and candidates have incorporated new media into their political strategizing. This is often a multi-faceted approach that combines new and old media forms to create highly specialized strategies. This allows them to reach wider audiences, but also to target very specific subsets of the electorate. They are able to tap into polling data {{and in some cases}} harness the analytics of the traffic and profiles on various social media outlets to get real-time data <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> engagement that is needed and the kinds of messages that are successful or unsuccessful.|$|E
2500|$|Although Stevenson {{mainly focused}} on cases of {{children}} who seemed to remember past lives, he also studied two cases in which adults under hypnosis seemed to remember a past life and show rudimentary use of a language they had not learned in the present life. Stevenson called this phenomenon “xenoglossy.” The linguist Sarah Thomason, critiquing these cases, wrote that Stevenson is “unsophisticated about language" [...] and that the cases are unconvincing. Thomason concluded, [...] "the linguistic evidence is too weak to provide support for the claims of xenoglossy." [...] William J. Samarin, a linguist from the University of Toronto, wrote that Stevenson corresponded with linguists in a selective and unprofessional manner. He said that Stevenson corresponded with one linguist {{in a period of}} six years [...] "without raising any discussion <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> thing that linguists would need to know." [...] Another linguist, William Frawley, wrote, [...] "Stevenson does not consider enough linguistic evidence in these cases to warrant his metaphysics." ...|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} first step toward a functional analysis of survival processing is thinking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> problems memory would have evolved to solve. Figuring out selection pressures can be difficult. Post-hoc accounts, also known as just-so stories, are an important problem to avoid.

50|$|The {{attempt to}} provide proofs or {{arguments}} {{for the existence of}} God is one aspect of what is known as natural theology or the natural theistic project. This strand of natural theology attempts to justify belief in God by independent grounds. There is plenty of philosophical literature on faith (especially fideism) and other subjects generally considered to be outside the realm of natural theology. Perhaps most of philosophy of religion is predicated on natural theology's assumption that the existence of God can be justified or warranted on rational grounds. There has been considerable philosophical and theological debate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> proofs, justifications and arguments that are appropriate for this discourse.|$|E
