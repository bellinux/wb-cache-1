5|$|Eventually, {{the final}} design was <b>agreed</b> <b>in</b> 1723, and it {{incorporated}} {{the work of}} de Tigné as well as Charles François de Mondion, the Order's military engineer. The new fort was to be square in shape, with four bastions and two cavaliers. The fort was financed by, and named after, the Portuguese Grand Master, António Manoel de Vilhena. He also set up the Manoel Foundation, a fund responsible for the maintenance and garrison of Fort Manoel and its outworks.|$|E

5|$|Premier League clubs <b>agreed</b> <b>in</b> {{principle}} in December 2012, to radical new cost controls.

5|$|The {{number of}} scribes were disputed in the past. According to Kenyon's opinion {{there were five}} scribes, two scribes in the Old Testament (I and II) and three in the New (III, IV, and V). Subsequently, Skeat and Milne argued {{there were only two}} or {{possibly}} three scribes. Present scholars <b>agreed</b> <b>in</b> that case (Metzger, Aland, Hernández, Jongkind).|$|E

50|$|Adjectives are French-origin (Cree has no {{adjectives}}), and as in French {{they are}} either pre- or postnominal. Prenominal adjectives <b>agree</b> <b>in</b> gender (like French), however, postnominal adjectives do not <b>agree</b> <b>in</b> gender (unlike French).|$|R
50|$|Within {{the study}} of European languages, {{recognition}} of the nominal grouping is reflected in traditional grammar studies based on Latin, which has a highly productive marking system. Nominals {{can be seen in}} the shared morphemes that attach to the ends of nouns and adjectives and <b>agree</b> <b>in</b> case and gender. In the example below, 'son' and 'good' <b>agree</b> <b>in</b> nominative case because they are the subject of the sentence and at the same time they <b>agree</b> <b>in</b> gender because the ending is masculine. Likewise, 'the dog' and 'wild' share the same morphemes that show they <b>agree</b> <b>in</b> accusative case and masculine gender. In Latin agreement goes beyond nouns and adjectives.|$|R

This will normally be {{at the end of}} a European Council meeting and according to the same format (chaired by the President of the European Council and including the President of the Commission), but usually restricted to the (currently 19) Heads of State or Government of countries whose currency is the euro.|$|E

As {{a result of the}} conference, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali gave General Bernard Janvier, the UN military commander, the authority to request NATO airstrikes without consulting civilian UN officials. The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top political body, and the UN also agreed to use NATO air strikes in response to attacks on any of the other safe areas in Bosnia. The participants at the conference also <b>agreed</b> <b>in</b> principle to the use of large-scale NATO air strikes in response to future acts of Serb aggression.|$|E
5|$|Annalee Call was {{originally}} written for Angelina Jolie; although Jolie auditioned, she {{turned down the}} role and Winona Ryder was cast in December 1996. Call had a generally negative critical reception, largely due to a perceived lack of synergy with the film and the franchise. Roger Ebert praised Ryder's acting, but felt {{that she did not}} bring a strong presence or purpose to the film except as a familiar face to younger viewers. Nordling <b>agreed</b> <b>in</b> a 2012 Ain't It Cool News analysis, saying that Call's synthetic origin is unnecessary and her only role is that of a surrogate audience.|$|E

5|$|As part of Strasburg's {{rehabilitation}} {{from his}} Tommy John surgery, {{and as a}} precaution due to his low innings total in 2011, the Nationals decided {{to limit the number}} of innings Strasburg would throw in the 2012 season. Although the number was never official, rumors started that Strasburg's limit would be between 160 and 180 innings. It was also decided that Strasburg's shutdown would be final; he would not pitch in the playoffs. Dr. Lewis Yocum, the surgeon who operated on Strasburg's elbow, <b>agreed</b> <b>in</b> 2011 that Strasburg's 2012 innings total should be limited, although he did not consult with Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo or Strasburg during the season. Teammate Jordan Zimmermann underwent a similar process the year before.|$|E
5|$|As {{the case}} {{expanded}} beyond his jurisdiction, Curto recused {{himself from the}} trial {{and was replaced by}} Javier Beltramone, who released García from prison. Litoral Gas demanded Beltramone's recusal for expressing an opinion about the case to the press. The appeal court <b>agreed</b> <b>in</b> a 2–1 vote to remove Beltramone, and the case was transferred to Patricia Bilotta. García had claimed that he was following instructions received {{in the days before the}} explosion, so Bilotta summoned the technical officers of Litoral Gas to clarify that point. Litoral Gas said that García had not received any instructions prior to the explosion.|$|E

In 1879, an uprising by Chief Morosi was quelled but led to intertribal strife over {{the partition of}} his land. The Cape government sought to regain control in 1880 by extending the Cape Peace Preservation Act of 1878 to Basutoland, which provided for the disarmament of natives. Attempts {{to enforce the law}} resulted in the Basuto Gun War of 1880 to 1881. Unrest continued until it was <b>agreed</b> <b>in</b> 1884 to place the territory under direct British control.|$|E

In the end it was a promise that he was unable to keep after his search for alternative landing grounds proved fruitless. With his only other option being to return home, he set up his headquarters at Cape Royds, close to the old Discovery base. For this he was roundly condemned by the British polar establishment at the time.|$|E
