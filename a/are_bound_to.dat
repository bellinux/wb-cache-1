5|$|After secretion, only a {{very small}} {{proportion}} of the thyroid hormones travel freely in the blood. Most <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> thyroxine-binding globulin (about 70%), transthyretin (10%), and albumin (15%). Only the 0.03% of T4 and 0.3% of T3 traveling freely has hormonal activity. In addition, up to 85% of the T3 in blood is produced following conversion from T4 by iodothyronine deiodinases in organs around the body.|$|E
5|$|Rodents use scent marking in {{many social}} {{contexts}} including inter- and intra-species communication, the marking of trails {{and the establishment}} of territories. Their urine provides genetic information about individuals including the species, the sex and individual identity, and metabolic information on dominance, reproductive status and health. Compounds derived from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> several urinary proteins. The odor of a predator depresses scent-marking behavior.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme rates {{depend on}} {{solution}} conditions and substrate concentration. To find {{the maximum speed}} of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This {{is shown in the}} saturation curve on the right. Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, {{more and more of the}} free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES complex. At the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> substrate, and the amount of ES complex is the same as the total amount of enzyme.|$|E
50|$|In circulation, 97.0 to 99.5% of {{testosterone}} <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> plasma proteins, with 0.5 to 3.0% unbound. It <b>is</b> tightly <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> SHBG and weakly to albumin. Of circulating testosterone, 30 <b>to</b> 44% <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> SHBG while 54 <b>to</b> 68% <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> albumin. Testosterone that is unbound {{is referred to}} as free testosterone and testosterone that <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> albumin <b>is</b> referred to as bioavailable testosterone. Unlike testosterone that <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> SHBG, bioavailable testosterone <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> plasma proteins weakly enough such that, similarly to free testosterone, it may be biologically active, at least to some extent. When referenced collectively (i.e., free, bioavailable, and SHBG-bound), circulating testosterone {{is referred to as}} total testosterone.|$|R
5000|$|Cortisol - Approximately 75% of the {{cortisol}} {{in circulation}} <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> transcortin. (The rest <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> serum albumin.) Cortisol {{is thought to}} be biologically active only when it <b>is</b> not <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> transcortin.|$|R

5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E

The attribution in certain quarters of such a wish to the judiciary is misconceived and appears to be the product of lack of understanding of the judicial function and the sources of law which the courts <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> apply.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos are {{synthetic}} {{molecules that}} {{are the product of}} a redesign of natural nucleic acid structure. Usually 25 bases in length, they bind to complementary sequences of RNA or single-stranded DNA by standard nucleic acid base-pairing. In terms of structure, the difference between Morpholinos and DNA is that, while Morpholinos have standard nucleic acid bases, those bases <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> morpholine rings linked through phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphates. The figure compares the structures of the two strands depicted there, one of RNA and the other of a Morpholino. Replacement of anionic phosphates with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate groups eliminates ionization in the usual physiological pH range, so Morpholinos in organisms or cells are uncharged molecules. The entire backbone of a Morpholino is made from these modified subunits.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{approximately}} 4% of serum testosterone <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> transcortin. A similarly {{small fraction}} of serum estradiol <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> transcortin as well.|$|R

5|$|The {{electron}} {{is by far}} {{the least}} massive of these particles at , with a negative electrical charge and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques. It is the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured. Under ordinary conditions, electrons <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an ion. Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson; see history of subatomic physics for details.|$|E

5|$|The ribs <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> {{the spine}} by {{flexible}} cartilage, {{which allows the}} ribcage to collapse rather than snap under high pressure. While sperm whales are well adapted to diving, repeated dives to great depths have long-term effects. Bones show the same pitting that signals decompression sickness in humans. Older skeletons showed the most extensive pitting, whereas calves showed no damage. This damage may indicate that sperm whales are susceptible to decompression sickness, and sudden surfacing could be lethal to them.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria often {{attach to}} {{surfaces}} and form dense aggregations called biofilms, and larger formations known as microbial mats. These biofilms and mats {{can range from}} a few micrometres in thickness to up to half a metre in depth, and may contain multiple species of bacteria, protists and archaea. Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures, such as microcolonies, through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients. In natural environments, such as soil or the surfaces of plants, the majority of bacteria <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> surfaces in biofilms. Biofilms are also important in medicine, as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of implanted medical devices, and bacteria protected within biofilms are much harder to kill than individual isolated bacteria.|$|E
5|$|The Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine is on {{the main}} campus {{as well as in}} two {{regional}} campses at St. Catharines and Kitchener. The Waterloo Regional Campus is located in downtown Kitchener, sharing facilities with the Health Sciences Campus of the University of Waterloo. The campus in St. Catharines is at Brock University's Niagara Health and Bioscience Research Complex. Approximately 30 medical students in each year of the program attend each campus. Those who apply to McMaster's School of Medicine are asked to rank their site choice (Hamilton, Niagara Region, Waterloo Region) from first to third, or no preference. Offers of admission to the medical school are made from a rank list irrespective of geographical preference. Subsequent to an applicant's acceptance, registrants to the class are placed based on their preference and geographical background.

5|$|Oregonâ€™s {{state courts}} are courts of general jurisdiction, unlike federal courts. That is, the state courts can hear all cases {{regardless}} of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn decisions of the Oregon court, Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts. Federal courts are not required to follow the decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for decisions based on federal law, regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state. However, federal courts <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> follow Oregon law and decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those federal courts are not based in Oregon, per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason federal courts, and courts from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).|$|E
