25|$|Highwall mining {{is another}} form of surface mining that evolved from <b>auger</b> <b>mining.</b> In Highwall mining, the coal seam is {{penetrated}} by a continuous miner propelled by a hydraulic Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM). A typical cycle includes sumping (launch-pushing forward) and shearing (raising and lowering the cutterhead boom to cut the entire height of the coal seam). As the coal recovery cycle continues, the cutterhead is progressively launched into the coal seam for 19.72 feet (6.01 m). Then, the Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM) automatically inserts a 19.72-foot (6.01 m) long rectangular Pushbeam (Screw-Conveyor Segment) into the center section of the machine between the Powerhead and the cutterhead. The Pushbeam system can penetrate nearly 1,000 feet (300 m) into the coal seam. One patented Highwall mining system uses augers enclosed inside the Pushbeam that prevent the mined coal from being contaminated by rock debris during the conveyance process. Using a video imaging and/or a gamma ray sensor and/or other Geo-Radar systems like a coal-rock interface detection sensor (CID), the operator can see ahead projection of the seam-rock interface and guide the continuous miner's progress.

40|$|During this quarter, the {{majority}} of activity focused on grout emplacement at the Lodestar Energy Inc. (formerly Costain Coal Co.) surface <b>mine</b> <b>auger</b> holes described in the previous report. Specifically, {{two different types of}} grout pumps were investigated: a piston pump used in previous demonstrations, and a progressive cavity pump. The latter is currently utilized for grouting in underground coal mines, is relatively small and portable, and is capable of receiving dry material (e. g., fly ash) and water, mixing it to produce a grout, and pumping the grout at high pressure. It is therefore worthwhile to investigate it`s potential use in <b>auger</b> <b>mine</b> filling. Several field demonstrations were conducted using the different pumps. Numerous problems were encountered when using the progressive cavity pump, all of which were related to its inability to handle the highly reactive and heterogeneous FBC fly ash. Even relatively small ash agglomerates (< 1 in. in diameter), which were not a problem for the larger piston pump, caused blockages in the progressive cavity pump which not only proved extremely difficult to clear, but also resulted in significant mechanical failures. Furthermore, mixing of dry fly ash with water within the progressive cavity pump was inconsistent and difficult to control. Consequently, the pump was unable to completely fill even a single auger hole. It was found that a large proportion of bed ash in the grout generated a large amount of heat and caused early stiffening of the material. During the experiments, cylinders of grout were prepared for compressive strength testing, and moisture contents were determined on-site. A thermocouple assembly was also constructed to record grout temperatures within an auger hole...|$|R

40|$|Highwall mining is an {{important}} coal mining method. It appears that upwards of 60 highwall miners are presently in operation, and they may account for approximately 4 % of total U. S. coal production. A review of the Mines Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) data over the 20 year period from 1983 to 2002 identified 9 fatalities attributable to <b>auger</b> and highwall <b>mining</b> of which inadequate ground control accounted for 1 / 3. In the past 5 years, 1 fatality occurred in highwall mining. Estimates of the manpower requirements in highwall mining suggest that its fatality rate {{is essentially the same}} as for surface coal mining, thus highwall mining appears to be a very safe modern mining method. Highwall stability is the major ground control related safety concern, and operators are required to develop and follow an appropriate highwall mining ground control plan. The plans usually specify the following geotechnical parameters: hole width, maximum hole depth, maximum overburden depth, seam thickness, web pillar width, barrier pillar width and number of holes between barriers. Calculated web pillar stability factor exceeded 1. 3 for most designs evaluated. This study examined records from 5, 289 highwall miner holes with a total completed footage of about 2, 560, 000 feet to understand the reasons for early pull out. Average lost footage is typically about 20 % of planned footage. Only 35 % of the holes reached planned depth, and 20 % were short due to rockfalls. Water and adverse geology accounted for 15 % of the losses. Mechanical/electrical problems, guidance, and slope stability problems accounted for the remaining 30 %. Web pillar stability factor for these holes also exceeded 1. 3 in 95 % of cases. Best practices to avoid trapped miners include: avoid mining in stream valleys, avoid mining near outside corners, careful alignment of each hole and the use of an onboard guidance system. Several issues in highwall mining ground control require further investigation including highwall <b>mining</b> through old <b>auger</b> workings, highwall <b>mining</b> near old underground mines, multiple-seam and multiple lift highwall mining and finally the size and frequency of barrier pillars...|$|R

40|$|Advances in mining {{technology}} have enabled deeper seams of coal to be mined from the surface. Highwall mining is frequently used to mine areas at the perimeters of a surface mine when {{removal of the}} overburden becomes uneconomical or threatens environmentally sensitive surface features. At the same time, advances in materials and technology have enabled highwall mining of coal that create blind headings over 300 meters in length. Deeper surface mining and deeper highwall penetration depths have lead to more frequent encounters with methane gas. While this coal is remotely mined from the surface, underground ignitions of methane have propagated {{to the surface and}} injured miners. Methods described in this paper show how this hazard can be correctly monitored and controlled for <b>auger</b> type highwall <b>mining</b> machines. Research indicates that small quantities of gas liberated during mining migrate to the face, creating higher gas concentrations than would otherwise be expected.

30|$|Highwall mining {{systems can}} {{sometimes}} be the final mining method used in open cut mines, or it {{can serve as a}} means of transition, with low capital cost, from surface mining to underground mining. From the results of a series of laboratory tests and numerical analyses, stability of openings/pillars in the <b>auger</b> <b>mining</b> system is higher than that in CHM. The pillar strength for circular shape openings in the <b>auger</b> <b>mining</b> system is about 1.2 – 1.3 times stronger than that of the rectangular shape openings in CHM. The pillar strength index increases with the increasing pillar width for both shapes of openings. It is also found that backfilling improve the pillar stability. It improves the pillar stability by, increasing its Young’s modulus, the peak stress and the residual stress. From test results using the backfilled fractured pillar models, fractured pillars restore their strength by backfilling. It means that backfilling improves the fractured pillar behaviour very well. However, at greater depths, the effectiveness of backfilling cannot be obtained well. Based on this result, the highwall mining operation can be applied even in weak geological conditions by application of the appropriate mining system and/or backfilling system.|$|E

The use of highwall mining systems has increasingly come into play in the US and Australia. However, it is not common in Indonesia. Moreover, Indonesia coal measure is categorized as weak geological condition. Some problems are likely to arise during the application of the highwall mining system for example instability of openings and highwalls due to the roof and pillar failures. Therefore, study of highwall mining system application in Indonesia is needed in order to increase the recovery rate of coal mining in Indonesia.

40|$|In This Chapter [How {{inert gas}} works to prevent methane explosions How inert gas is {{generated}} and delivered at highwall mines Volume and quality requirements for inert gas at highwall mines How an inert gas system is operated and Precautions to take during mining to prevent methane explosions] This chapter discusses a method, originally developed by Volkwein and Ulery [1993], to prevent methane explosions during highwall mining. In highwall <b>mining,</b> a horizontal <b>auger</b> or a <b>mining</b> machine enters the coal seam from a surface mine pit {{at the bottom}} of a highwall, and the coal is mined out from a series of parallel holes. Explosions can be prevented by injecting inert gas into each hole as it is mined. Coal near the surface has lost most of its methane gas over time. However, in recent years, surface mining has been used for deeper reserves of coal. This trend toward mining deeper reserves has increased the chance of encountering methane, and methane explosions at highwall mining operations have resulted in injuries. HOW INERT GAS WORKS TO PREVENT METHANE EXPLOSIONS A methane explosion requires the presence of sufficient amounts of both methane and oxygen, as well as an ignition source. If the methane cannot be reduced and the ignition source cannot be eliminated, then explosions may be prevented by adding an inert gas, which contains little to no oxygen, to the mixture [FWQA 1970]. Just how much inert gas must be added depends on the mining rate, as well as the composition of the inert gas. An explosibility diagram can be used to show whether a methane mixture is explosive after inert gas is added [Zabetakis et al. 1959] (Figure 10 - 1). This diagram indicates that gas mixtures fall into one of three range categories explosive, explosive when mixed with air, and nonexplosive depending on the percentage of methane and percentage of effective inert. Effective inert is calculated from the percentage of excess nitrogen 3 and percentage of carbon dioxide in the mixture...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this is paper is to review {{the current state of}} knowledge and practice in highwall mining (HWM). HWM has become a widely-applied method in surface mining, commonly used alone or in conjunction with contour or slot mining. It provides 800 -feet to 1, 200 -feet of additional recovery when the economic stripping ratio is reached in contour mining or in slot mining when surface access to a reserve is limited. A significant attribute of the highwall miner is its versatility. HWM has been used successfully to mine abandoned pre-reclamation law highwalls, points or ridges uneconomic to mine by underground or other surface methods, outcrop barriers left adjacent to underground mines, separate benches of the same seam where the parting thickness or quality differences between benches render complete extraction uneconomic, previously augered areas containing otherwise inaccessible additional reserves and close or widely spaced multiple seams. The theory and design methods to assess roof, pillar, and floor stability are presented followed by three case histories. Simple design charts for sizing HWM web and barrier pillars are also presented. A recommended web pillar width may be obtained from the design charts given the overburden depth, the HWM cut width, and the mining height. Given the depth and panel width for a set of HWM cuts, another set of charts gives a suggested barrier pillar width. The case histories, from Northern and Southern Appalachia are used to illustrate the application of rock mechanics to quantify the stability of the highwall, roof, web pillars, and floor. The case histories involve 1) mining through a previously augered highwall, 2) mining under back-stacked spoil and 3) selective mining of closely spaced benches of the same seam. Because each site is unique, the appropriate pre-mining geotechnical analyses range from the calculation of roof, web pillar, and floor bearing capacity stability factors to detailed numerical modeling of the <b>auger</b> and underground <b>mine</b> workings. When operating in the vicinity of existing underground <b>mine</b> or <b>auger</b> workings, the determination of ground deformation and strains resulting from highwall mining is a necessary facet of a ground control investigation...|$|R

A combination of gasoline and diesel engine exhaust gases was introduced into the auger drill hole using a short section of pipe located at the collar. Gas samples were taken and analyzed on-site with infrared detectors for oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, and carbon monoxide. Evacuated bottle samples were also taken and analyzed by gas chromatography in the laboratory. These gas results were analyzed for explosibility.

The highest methane level observed was 9. 55 %. The levels of inert gas (carbon dioxide and nitrogen) were sufficiently high to prevent any ignition of the methane. Results showed that for all conditions during mining, gas concentrations were nonexplosive. The gas content of the coal was about 0. 30 cm 3 /g.
