5|$|In 1997, Eastwood {{directed}} {{and starred in}} the political thriller <b>Absolute</b> <b>Power,</b> alongside Gene Hackman (with whom he had appeared in Unforgiven). Eastwood {{played the role of}} a veteran thief who witnesses the Secret Service cover up of a murder. The film received a mixed reception from critics.|$|E
5|$|During the Flavian dynasty, the princes of the Iazyges {{were trained}} in the Roman army, officially as an honor, but in reality serving as a hostage, because the kings held <b>absolute</b> <b>power</b> over the Iazyges. There were offers from the princes of the Iazyges to supply troops, but these were denied based on the fear that they might revolt or desert in a war.|$|E
5|$|Execution by {{elephant}} was {{a common}} method of capital punishment in South and Southeast Asia, particularly in India, where Asian elephants were used to crush, dismember, or torture captives in public executions. The animals were trained and versatile, able to kill victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's <b>absolute</b> <b>power</b> {{and his ability to}} control wild animals.|$|E

5|$|In January 1956, with no {{legislature}} and constitution in place, Diệm used his <b>absolute</b> <b>power</b> {{to dissolve the}} Revolutionary Council by launching police raids on the members, forcing those from the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo who had rallied to his side {{to go on the}} run. As a result, they turned against him.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{this story}} was simply content to show <b>absolute</b> <b>power</b> corrupting absolutely. Unfortunately, aside from Persis, none of the Augments stop {{to think about what}} they're doing or why, and the story of Malik is content to blandly repeat the story of Khan, but without the crucial {{personal}} motivator of revenge. I think the writers owed the material more than this.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the auspices}} of a régime d'exception (the {{equivalent}} {{of a state of}} emergency), Mobutu assumed sweeping, almost <b>absolute,</b> <b>power</b> for five years after which, he claimed, democracy would be restored. Mobutu's coup, which promised both economic and political stability, was supported by the United States and other Western governments. Initially, his rule met widespread popularity. He increasingly took other powers, abolishing the post of Prime Minister in 1966 and dissolving Parliament in 1967.|$|E
50|$|Between <b>Absolute</b> <b>Power's</b> final {{radio series}} and the one-off special, Tavener and {{producer}} Dawn Ellis created two six-part series of High Table, Lower Orders (BBC Radio Four, 2005-2006), featuring a murder mystery at a Cambridge College {{similar to the}} one the writer had attended.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{complete}} {{theory of the}} power behavior of one-ports under periodic multi-sinusoidal linear operation is presented. It {{is based on a}} time-domain vector space approach in two steps. First, the one-port instantaneous current is decomposed into four orthogonal currents. Second, their <b>power</b> counterparts (<b>absolute</b> <b>powers)</b> are defined as products of norms. Hence, vector and scalar expressions for the <b>absolute</b> <b>powers</b> in the frequency domain are derived both in terms of voltage and current rootmean square (rms) -phasor vectors {{and in terms of the}} voltage rms-phasor vector and of the multi-frequency admittance matrix. Finally, the hyper-power, a quantity consisting of a scalar/matrix pair, is devised. Like the well-known complex power, the hyper-power condenses all power information and obeys the usual conservation laws...|$|R
50|$|Kijo is a {{group of}} Council of Elders who were very powerful. They had <b>absolute</b> <b>powers</b> to excommunicate, confisticate, and execute those who have been found guilty by the Gasa.

5|$|But {{above all}} Mario Vargas Llosa uses the fictional Urania to {{facilitate}} the novel's attempt at remembering the regime. The novel opens and closes with Urania's story, effectively framing the narrative {{in the terms of}} remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present. In addition, because of her academic study {{of the history of the}} Trujillo regime, Urania is also confronting the memory of the regime for the country as a whole. This is in keeping with one purpose of the book, which is to ensure that the atrocities of the dictatorship and the dangers of <b>absolute</b> <b>power</b> will be remembered by a new generation.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1932, Himmler {{appointed}} Heydrich {{chief of}} the renamed security service—the Sicherheitsdienst (SD). Heydrich's counterintelligence service grew into an effective machine of terror and intimidation. With Hitler striving for <b>absolute</b> <b>power</b> in Germany, Himmler and Heydrich wished to control the political police forces of all 17 German states. They began with Bavaria. In 1933, Heydrich gathered some of his men from the SD and together they stormed police headquarters in Munich and took over the organisation using intimidation tactics. Himmler became the Munich police chief and Heydrich became the commander of Department IV, the political police.|$|E
5|$|The Macedonian kings, who wielded <b>absolute</b> <b>power</b> and {{commanded}} {{state resources}} such as gold and silver, facilitated mining operations to mint currency, finance their armies and, by the reign of PhilipII, a Macedonian navy. Unlike the other diadochi successor states, the imperial cult fostered by Alexander was never adopted in Macedonia, yet Macedonian rulers nevertheless assumed roles as high priests of the kingdom and leading patrons of domestic and international cults of the Hellenistic religion. The authority of Macedonian kings was theoretically limited by {{the institution of the}} army, while a few municipalities within the Macedonian commonwealth enjoyed a high degree of autonomy and even had democratic governments with popular assemblies.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} between civilization and barbarism mirrors Latin America's {{difficulties in the}} post-Independence era. Literary critic Sorensen Goodrich argues that although Sarmiento {{was not the first}} to articulate this dichotomy, he forged it into a powerful and prominent theme that would impact Latin American literature. He explores the issue of civilization versus the cruder aspects of a caudillo culture of brutality and <b>absolute</b> <b>power.</b> Facundo set forth an oppositional message that promoted a more beneficial alternative for society at large. Although Sarmiento advocated various changes, such as honest officials who understood enlightenment ideas of European and Classical origin, for him education was the key.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} was often tense between the City and the Crown. The City of London {{had been a}} stronghold of republicanism during the Civil War (1642–1651), and the wealthy and economically dynamic capital still {{had the potential to}} be a threat to Charles II, as had been demonstrated by several republican uprisings in London in the early 1660s. The City magistrates were of the generation that had fought in the Civil War, and could remember how Charles I's grab for <b>absolute</b> <b>power</b> had led to that national trauma.|$|E
5|$|The {{voters of}} Henderson County chose Dixon to {{represent}} them at the state constitutional convention of 1849. The Whigs nominated him to chair the convention, but he lost to the Democratic nominee James Guthrie {{by a vote of}} 50 to 43. A large slaveholder, Dixon introduced numerous measures {{to protect the rights of}} slaveholders in the new constitution. Among them were assertions that slave property was just as inviolable as any other property, that the rights of property were above constitutional sanction, and that <b>absolute</b> <b>power</b> over property cannot exist in a republic. Though some of these ideas were challenged, all eventually found their way into the Kentucky Constitution of 1850.|$|E
40|$|Cement pastes {{containing}} short steel fibers, which {{contribute to}} electron conduction, exhibit positive values (up to 68 mV/°C) of the <b>absolute</b> thermoelectric <b>power.</b> A steel fiber content of 1. 0 % by mass of cement gives a higher {{value of the}} <b>absolute</b> thermoelectric <b>power</b> than a content of 0. 5 % by mass cement, in addition to yielding more reversibility and linearity in the variation of the Seebeck voltage with temperature difference (up to 65 °C). In contrast, cement pastes containing short carbon fibers, which contribute to hole conduction, exhibit negative or slightly positive values of the <b>absolute</b> thermoelectric <b>power.</b> D 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

5|$|Marshal Zhukov {{was rewarded}} for his support with full {{membership}} in the Presidium, but Khrushchev feared his popularity and power. In October, the defense minister was sent {{on a tour of}} the Balkans, as Khrushchev arranged a Presidium meeting to dismiss him. Zhukov learned what was happening, and hurried back to Moscow, only to be formally notified of his dismissal. At a Central Committee meeting several weeks later, not a word was said in Zhukov's defense. Khrushchev completed the consolidation of power by arranging for Bulganin's dismissal as premier in favor of himself (Bulganin was appointed to head the Gosbank) and by establishing a USSR Defense Council, led by himself, effectively making him commander in chief. Though Khrushchev was now preeminent, he did not enjoy Stalin's <b>absolute</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
5|$|Not {{having been}} {{involved}} in the coup d'état, Rainilaiarivony provided direction for his brother {{and the rest of the}} court as they grappled with the gravity of their acts. He proposed that future monarchs would no longer have <b>absolute</b> <b>power</b> but would instead rule by the consent of the nobles. A series of terms were proposed by Rainilaiarivony that the nobles agreed to impose on Radama's widow, Rasoherina. Under Rainilaiarivony's new monarchy, a sovereign required the consent of the nobles to issue a death sentence or promulgate a new law, and was forbidden to disband the army. The new power sharing agreement was concluded by a political marriage between the queen and the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|President Paul von Hindenburg {{appointed}} Hitler Chancellor on January 30, 1933. Over {{the next}} few months, during the so-called Gleichschaltung, Hitler dispensed {{with the need for}} the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic as a legislative body and eliminated all rival political parties in Germany, so that by the middle of 1933 the country had become a one-party state under his direction and control. Hitler did not exercise <b>absolute</b> <b>power,</b> however, despite his swift consolidation of political authority. As chancellor, Hitler did not command the army, which remained under the formal leadership of Hindenburg, a highly respected veteran field marshal. While many officers were impressed by Hitler's promises of an expanded army, a return to conscription, and a more aggressive foreign policy, the army continued to guard its traditions of independence {{during the early years of}} the Nazi regime.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 16th century, the Lords was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} houses of Parliament. A process of gradual developments combined with such moments of crisis as the English Civil Wars transferred the political control of England, first from the Crown to the House of Lords {{and then to the}} House of Commons. The rising wealth of the Commons eventually allowed it to wage two civil wars, dethrone two Kings, and gradually reduce the power of the Lords. Prior to the House of Lords Act 1999, the power of the Lords had been diminished by the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 which stripped the Lords of the ability to block, or veto, adoption of most bills; at most it could delay bills for one year. Furthermore, the Commons has <b>absolute</b> <b>power</b> when it comes to money bills.|$|E
5|$|The case of Ellis v. Dubowski (1921) {{lays down}} the {{principle}} {{that there can be}} no delegation of authority to an absolute body from which no right of appeal exists. In this case, a licensing committee exercising statutory powers to license cinemas to be used for film screenings had imposed a condition in a licence that films had to be certified by the British Board of Film Censors before they could be shown. This was found to be ultra vires because the Board should not be made the final dictator. Furthermore, the fact that the Board had been given <b>absolute</b> <b>power</b> to prohibit films for reasons which might be private or influenced by trade considerations was sufficient to render the condition ultra vires.|$|E
5|$|Radama's successor, Queen Ranavalona I (1828–61), {{responded to}} {{increasing}} {{political and cultural}} encroachment {{on the part of}} Britain and France by issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of Christianity in Madagascar and pressuring most foreigners to leave the territory. Residents of Madagascar could accuse one another of various crimes, including theft, Christianity and especially witchcraft, for which the ordeal of tangena was routinely obligatory. Between 1828 and 1861, the tangena ordeal caused about 3,000 deaths annually. Among those who continued to reside in Imerina were Jean Laborde, an entrepreneur who developed munitions and other industries on behalf of the monarchy, and Joseph-François Lambert, a French adventurer and slave trader, with whom then-Prince Radama II signed a controversial trade agreement termed the Lambert Charter. Succeeding his mother, Radama II (1861–63) attempted to relax the queen's stringent policies, but was overthrown two years later by Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony (1852–1865) and an alliance of Andriana (noble) and Hova (commoner) courtiers, who sought to end the <b>absolute</b> <b>power</b> of the monarch.|$|E
