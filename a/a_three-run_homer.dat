5|$|Playing as the Rays' primary catcher, on April 4 he went 2-5 with <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> in a {{win over}} the Texas Rangers. Two weeks later he hit two home runs with six RBIs in a 16-1 win over the New York Yankees. In May, Hanigan, plagued for nearly two weeks by a {{strained}} hamstring, was finally placed on the 15-day DL on May 28. On June 17 he had a home run and a walk against the Baltimore Orioles, but he then missed several more games due to neck stiffness and later with soreness in his left side.|$|E
5|$|On January 26, 2012, Ross {{finalized}} {{a one-year}} contract with the Boston Red Sox. He was supposed to provide depth off the bench, but injuries, particularly to Carl Crawford, led to him holding a starting role for the entire season. He started almost every day for Boston in all three outfield positions, but mainly right field. On April 14, Ross hit his first home run in a Red Sox uniform, a two-run shot off the Tampa Bay Rays's Dane De La Rosa in a 13–5 Red Sox victory. The next day, Ross hit <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> {{in the bottom of}} the second inning off Matt Moore in a 6–4 victory over the Rays. On May 18, 2012, Ross suffered a fractured foot after fouling a ball off his foot. He was placed on the disabled list and expected to miss from six to eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|Following their four-game {{sweep of}} Milwaukee in the {{beginning}} of September, the Phillies recorded their first playoff win since their 1993 World Series appearance on October 1, defeating the Brewers in Game 1. Cole Hamels was the victor, earning his first career playoff win. Hamels allowed no runs and two hits over his eight innings of work. Chase Utley batted in two runs, while Ryan Howard walked three times in the game. In Game 2, Shane Victorino's grand slam was all the run support starter Brett Myers needed, as he pitched seven innings and allowed only two runs. The Phillies' second consecutive victory was also supported by a pair of doubles from Victorino and from Jayson Werth. In a reversal of fortune, the Brewers scored two runs in the first inning of Game 3, and it proved to be enough to win the game. Brewers starter Dave Bush and closer Salomón Torres were able to hold off the Phillies despite a rally {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, keeping the Brewers alive for Game 4. However, the Phillies defeated the Brewers in Game 4 at Miller Park to win the series, 31. Jimmy Rollins, Jayson Werth and Pat Burrell all hit solo home runs, and Burrell contributed <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> as well. Joe Blanton struck out seven Brewers, holding the team to one run on five hits through six innings.|$|E
50|$|On September 9, 2007, Durham hit <b>a</b> pinch-hit <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> in {{the eighth}} inning to help San Francisco beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-2.|$|R
50|$|Fred Lynn {{opened the}} scoring {{in the first}} with <b>a</b> two-out, <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> off Reds starter Gary Nolan. Meanwhile, the fresh Tiant breezed through the first four innings, holding the Reds to all zeros.|$|R
50|$|On October 16, 2014, the Giants won the National League pennant on <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> walk-off <b>homer</b> by Travis Ishikawa, and Fox {{broadcaster}} Joe Buck {{quoted the}} line {{as the ball}} landed in the right-field stands.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Phillies claimed Jerome Williams off waivers and {{designated}} O'Sullivan for assignment, Williams {{started in the}} opener of a two-game series with the Angels in Los Angeles. Williams threw five shutout innings before giving up two runs in the sixth; Bastardo then gave up five more, and the Angels won 7–2. The Phillies also lost the second game, 4–3, as A. J. Burnett's inconsistency continued. The second (and final) series of the road trip pitted the Phillies against the San Francisco Giants. Hamels started game one, allowing <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> in the fourth inning to give the Giants a 3–0 lead. The Phillies rallied, with a Marlon Byrd {{home run in the}} fifth inning and a two-run homer by Cody Asche to tie the game in the eighth. In the tenth, Chase Utley was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded (scoring one run) and Howard added a sacrifice fly to give the Phillies a 5–3 victory and Papelbon a save. In the second game, the Phillies jumped to a 5–1 lead before a sixth-inning infield error fueled a Giants rally. When Sandberg came out to remove Kendrick from the game, the pitcher stormed off the field in disgust; the Giants won, 6–5. The Phillies also lost the series' rubber match, 5–2; despite a quality start from Buchanan and Asche's three hits, the Giants had strong hitting by Michael Morse and Brandon Crawford.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{returned}} home to face the Seattle Mariners in a three-game series, and two unlikely players were key contributors in the team's win in the series opener: Jerome Williams allowed one run in seven innings and Andrés Blanco hit <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> (his first home run in three years) to defeat the Mariners, 4–1. The next night, Burnett's struggles {{during the second half}} of the season continued as he gave up five runs in 7 innings for a 5–2 loss. The Phillies then edged the Mariners 4–3, with help from Wil Nieves (three hits) and the bullpen (Jake Diekman, Giles and Papelbon pitched four scoreless innings, striking out nine). The Phillies' home stand continued with a three-game series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Kendrick started game one; despite his continued first-inning struggles (he allowed three runs in the first, raising his season first-inning ERA to 9.69), the Phillies batted around in the third to take a 5–4 lead and strong pitching from both teams enabled them to hang on for the win. The next night, mental errors by the Phillies cost them the game 6–5 in 12 innings. Williams started the series' rubber match, continuing his effectiveness in a 7–1 win with eight strong innings and driving in a run with a suicide squeeze. The series win was the Phillies' first consecutive-series victory since April, a 33-series drought and their longest since 1996–1997.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> by Freeman and a solo {{home run}} by Peterson {{led to the}} Braves {{snapping}} a 14-game losing streak at Nationals Park in an 8-5 win {{in the first of}} three games against the Nationals. A four-run rally in the ninth inning wasn't enough to overcome a five-run deficit as the Braves fell 7-6 in the second game of the series. The Braves concluded the three-game series and 10-game stretch on the road by surrendering <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> to Anthony Rendon in a 9-1 loss to the Nationals.|$|E
50|$|Whitey Ford {{pitched a}} {{complete}} game, scattering eight hits, {{and got the}} support he needed from <b>an</b> Enos Slaughter <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> in the sixth.|$|R
50|$|On July 19 versus St. Louis, he belted {{his first}} career grand slam. The {{following}} day, Hyzdu established career-highs with four hits, including <b>a</b> pair of <b>three-run</b> <b>homers,</b> and seven runs batted in.|$|R
50|$|On August 5 {{against the}} Detroit Tigers, {{in the top}} 14, Tigers scored two runs via two-run home run by Plácido Polanco, which made it 8-6. Then in the bottom 14, Sox came back with four via {{reaching}} on error by Jermaine Dye and then <b>a</b> walk-off <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> by Nick Swisher, which made it 10-8.|$|R
25|$|Joaquín Andújar and Pete Vuckovich, each team's {{pitching}} aces, {{were locked}} in a scoreless pitching duel until {{the top half of}} the fifth, when Willie McGee belted <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> for the Cards.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{giving up}} <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> {{in the second}} inning, seven {{unanswered}} runs and a save by Mauricio Cabrera gave the Braves an 8-5 victory {{in the first of}} a four-game series against the Marlins.|$|E
25|$|On April 25, the Dodgers {{returned}} {{home for a}} four-game series against former manager Don Mattingly and the Miami Marlins. Giancarlo Stanton hit a homer in the opener as the Marlins won 3–2. He hit <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> in the next game, capping a five-run sixth inning off Kershaw in a 6–3 comeback win for the Marlins. Justin Nicolino pitched seven and one third shutout innings as the Marlins also won game three, 2–0. The Dodgers were swept by the Marlins in a four-game series {{for the first time}} ever as Stanton homered again and they won 5–3. <b>A</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> by Matt Kemp in the eighth inning gave the Dodgers another loss, this time to the Padres, 5–1. The Dodgers ended the month of April on a six-game losing streak, thanks to another 5–2 loss to the Padres on April 30.|$|E
50|$|While Mueller {{was being}} carried {{off the field}} to be {{replaced}} by pinch runner Clint Hartung, Dodger manager Chuck Dressen, acting on the instructions of Dodger bullpen coach Clyde Sukeforth, called on relief pitcher Ralph Branca, whose second pitch was hit by Thomson over the head of Andy Pafko into the Polo Grounds' lower left field stands for <b>a</b> game-winning, <b>three-run</b> <b>homer.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 2000 National League Division Series {{against the}} New York Mets, with the Giants {{trailing}} 4-1 {{in the bottom}} of the ninth, Snow hit <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> pinch-hit <b>homer</b> against Mets reliever Armando Benítez. However, the Giants failed to capitalize on their momentum, eventually falling in the 10th inning and going on to lose the series.|$|R
50|$|On August 15, Ward {{launched}} <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> pinch-hit <b>homer</b> {{with one}} out {{in the ninth inning}} to lift the Cubs to a 6-5 victory over the Florida Marlins for their ninth straight road win. The Cubs had lost their last 10 games at that stadium. He became a free agent {{at the end of the}} season.|$|R
25|$|On August 12, 2011, Jones hit <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> {{against the}} Chicago Cubs for his 1000th extra base hit. On August 19, 2011, Jones {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} return for the 2012 season, the final year on his contract, thus ending ongoing speculation about his possible retirement. On August 31, 2011, Jones hit his 450th career home run off John Lannan of the Washington Nationals.|$|E
25|$|Barajas {{made his}} Dodgers {{debut in the}} opener of a three-game series at the Milwaukee Brewers. In his debut he hit two doubles and <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> to propel the Dodgers to a 5–3 victory. Manny Ramirez, {{activated}} from the disabled list a few days beforehand, hit two doubles in the Dodgers' 5–4 victory in the next game. The bullpen came up big in the series finale, as the Dodgers earned their first series sweep since June with a 7–1 victory.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} of a three-game road series against the Mets on September 19, the Braves put up seven runs, {{including}} a solo homer by Freeman, and Blair surrendered just two runs off four hits in six innings pitched to earn his first victory of the season in a 7-3 win over the Mets. In the second game, the Braves put up five runs, including <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> in the seventh inning by Garcia, and Johnson earned the save to win series in a 5-4 victory over the Mets. The Mets jumped to a three-run lead in the final game of the series, but the Braves rallied back with four unanswered runs, which included a two-run homer by Anthony Recker in the seventh inning, {{to take the lead in}} the top of the ninth. In an almost exact repeat of the night before, Braves closer Johnson faced off against Cespedes with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. Cespedes hit the ball to deep right-center and had the distance for <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer,</b> but center fielder Inciarte raced towards the wall, made the jump and caught the ball above the fence to get the final out for a 4-3 Braves victory in their final game of the season against the Mets.|$|E
50|$|In Game Two of the NLCS {{against the}} Atlanta Braves, Koosman was shelled for six runs in 4⅔ innings (including <b>a</b> Hank Aaron <b>three-run</b> <b>homer).</b> The Mets won 11-6, however, then won {{the next game}} to {{complete}} the series' sweep.|$|R
50|$|The series {{moved to}} the Polo Grounds, where a five-run fifth inning was the undoing of Yankee starter Vic Raschi. A pair of errors and <b>a</b> Whitey Lockman <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> in that stanza gave Giants starter Jim Hearn a {{comfortable}} lead.|$|R
50|$|On March 28, 2011, the Rangers traded Treanor to the Kansas City Royals {{for cash}} considerations. He was the 2011 Opening Day catcher for the Royals. On April 3, he hit <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> walk-off <b>homer</b> in the 13th inning {{to beat the}} Anaheim Angels 12-9. On July 31, he {{was placed on the}} 7-day {{disabled}} list with a concussion after a collision with Matt LaPorta of the Cleveland Indians.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{loading the}} bases {{in both the}} first and second innings, the Braves were unable to score a run and {{surrendered}} five runs in those first two innings in a 7-2 loss in the first of three games against the Giants. <b>A</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> by Kemp in the fourth inning and one run surrendered in 7 2/3rd innings pitched by Foltynewicz was enough to secure a 3-1 win for the Braves in the second game of the series. The Braves concluded the series by surrendering four homers in a 13-4 loss to the Giants.|$|E
25|$|Bellinger {{then drove}} in the go-ahead {{run with a}} double {{in the top of}} the ninth off of Giles and the Dodgers added four more runs on a {{sacrifice}} fly by Austin Barnes and <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> by Pederson. Bregman homered off of Jansen in the bottom of the ninth but the Dodgers managed to even up the series. The Astros had two hits in the game; both were home runs. This was the first game in World Series history where both starting pitchers allowed four or fewer baserunners.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{dropped their}} third {{straight}} on the opener {{of a road}} series against the New York Mets, 6–3 as Jason Pridie hit <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> off Kuorda with two outs in the sixth inning. Ethier's hitting streak finally ended on May 7, when he went 0 for 4 against the Mets. He finished with a 30-game hitting streak, second most in Dodgers history behind the 31 game streak by Willie Davis in 1969. The game was doubly disappointing as the Dodgers losing streak hit 4 with a 4–2 loss. Clayton Kershaw pitched 6 2/3 strong innings and Andre Ethier hit a two-run homer to end the losing streak with a 4–2 win. The Dodgers road woes continued on May 9, when Manager Don Mattingly and third baseman Juan Uribe were both ejected after a bad umpire call in the eighth and the Pirates scored three runs in the next half inning to beat the Dodgers 4–1. The Dodgers picked up a big win the next day as Matt Kemp broke open a scoreless tie with <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> in the sixth inning and the Dodgers offense took off for a 10–3 win. The Dodgers {{took the lead in}} the series on May 11 as they shut out the Pirates 2–0 thanks to an excellent start by Hiroki Kuroda, who struck out eight in seven innings. The Dodgers finale against the Pirates was called off due to rain after two innings with the Dodgers leading 1–0. The game would eventually be made up on September 1.|$|E
5000|$|May 28 - The Cubs offense {{finally came}} alive as it homered three times off of Dodger ace Clayton Kershaw, but Jon Lester gave up <b>a</b> pair of <b>three-run</b> <b>homers</b> and the Cubs were swept out of LA losing 9-4. Willson Contreras, Javier Báez, and Anthony Rizzo homered for the Cubs in the losing effort.|$|R
50|$|The Toronto Blue Jays won {{the game}} with a score of 5-2 {{at the bottom of the}} 11th inning when Edwin Encarnación hit <b>a</b> walk-off <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> off Ubaldo Jiménez. Zach Britton, the Orioles' closer and 2016 American League Reliever of the Year, {{controversially}} did not appear in the game. The Blue Jays advanced to the American League Division Series to face the Rangers for the second consecutive time in the postseason; their first meeting was in the previous year's American League Division Series.|$|R
5000|$|Gagne was {{a fixture}} of the Twins drive to their second World Series appearance, and first World Series title, {{following}} the 1987 season. During the Twins march to their second World Series crown in four years, Gagne hit <b>a</b> game-winning, <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> in Game One of the 1991 World Series off Atlanta's Charlie Leibrandt. Gagne would hit only [...]213 during the Twins two post-season drives. Despite this low batting average, Gagne would slug five doubles and 4 home runs, along with knocking in 10 runs and scoring 12 times, to maximize those 18 hits.|$|R
25|$|The Braves {{opened up}} their next road series by {{surrendering}} <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> {{in the sixth}} inning and falling 6-3 to the Rockies. Despite loading the bases with one out in the ninth inning, the Braves were unable to capitalize and fell 4-3 to the Rockies. Teherán exited {{the game in the}} fifth inning with upper back discomfort. What had started as a strong outing for Wisler with only surrendering two hits after five innings pitched turned into a five-run collapse in the sixth inning as the Braves fell 8-4 to the Rockies. The Braves concluded the four-game series by surrendering seven runs, including a home run, in a 7-2 loss to the Rockies.|$|E
25|$|González {{pitched a}} perfect second inning. In {{the bottom of}} the second, Washington second baseman Daniel Murphy homered to right on Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks′s first pitch to tie the game at 1-1. Third baseman Anthony Rendon {{followed}} with a single, then advanced to second when catcher Matt Wieters executed a perfect bunt single. Center fielder Michael A. Taylor then hit <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> – his second consecutive home run in the series – to give Washington a 4-1 lead. After Hendricks got the first two outs of the inning, he gave up a double to Werth and the Cubs intentionally walked Harper, but Hendricks finally stopped the Nationals′ rally by striking out first baseman Ryan Zimmerman.|$|E
25|$|Trailing by 3 {{games in}} the Wild Card race with 6 games remaining, the Dodgers {{returned}} home on September 28 to play the Colorado Rockies. Clayton Kershaw struck out 10 in 8 scoreless innings and Shane Victorino hit <b>a</b> <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> in the 2nd inning as the Dodgers won 8-0. The Dodgers scored 8 runs in their third straight game, {{the first time they}} had done that since July 8–14, 2007. Matt Kemp hit 2 home runs on September 29 and Joe Blanton and 3 relievers combined to shut out the Rockies 3-0. The win, coupled with the Cardinals losing a game to the Nationals, moved the Dodgers to 2 back in the Wild Card race with 4 games remaining. The Dodgers finished off the sweep of the Rockies with a 7-1 win. Kemp, A.J. Ellis and Cruz all homered in the win.|$|E
50|$|Fully healthy in 1982, {{he pitched}} well {{coming out of}} the bullpen. On October 3, 1982, in the last regular season game started by Dodgers ace Fernando Valenzuela, Forster yielded <b>a</b> seventh-inning, <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> to the San Francisco Giants' Joe Morgan which proved to be the winning margin in a 5-3 Giants win. The loss by the Dodgers {{propelled}} the Atlanta Braves to the 1982 National League West Division title. Forster became a free agent and signed with the Atlanta Braves for the 1983 season. He had an efficient three seasons, compiling an ERA of under 3.00 in each of those seasons.|$|R
50|$|Sanders later {{signed with}} the Atlanta Braves for the 1991 MLB season. On July 31, Sanders hit <b>a</b> key <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> to spark <b>a</b> {{comeback}} win against the Pittsburgh Pirates during the Braves' run to the National League West Division title. However, {{he had to leave}} the Braves the very next day to report to the Atlanta Falcons because of a clause in his NFL contract and missed the postseason. Before the 1992 season, Sanders reworked his NFL deal whereby he still reported to the Falcons for training camp in August, but was allowed to rejoin the Braves for the postseason.|$|R
5000|$|In 1940, Vaughan was {{appointed}} team captain by Frankie Frisch {{when he took}} over as manager. Although he led the league in runs scored and triples again, he slumped to a career-low [...]300 batting average. This prompted Frisch to replace Vaughan as starting shortstop with Alf Anderson to start the 1941 season. However, Anderson didn't hit, and Vaughan was quickly back in the starting lineup. In the 1941 All-Star Game, Vaughan hit two home runs, but was upstaged by <b>a</b> ninth-inning, <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> by American Leaguer Ted Williams. Vaughan finished the year batting [...]316 in 106 games.|$|R
