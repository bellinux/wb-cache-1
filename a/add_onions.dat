50|$|Chicken marsala is an Italian-American dish {{made from}} chicken cutlets, mushrooms, and Marsala wine. It is a {{variation}} of traditional Italian scaloppina dishes, {{of which there are}} many varieties throughout Italy. The dish dates to the 19th century, when it most likely originated with English families who lived in western Sicily, where Marsala wine is produced. The chicken is coated in flour, briefly sautéed, and then removed from the pan, which is then used to make a Marsala reduction sauce. The sauce is made by reducing the wine to nearly the consistency of a syrup while <b>adding</b> <b>onions</b> or shallots, as well as mushrooms, herbs and possibly other ingredients. The sauce is then poured over the chicken, which has been kept in a warming oven, and served immediately.|$|R

A competition purported to have taken place in 1890 is sometimes mentioned in the dish's history, but both the recipe and the name existed before then. Another recipe, this one from 1909, <b>adds</b> <b>onions</b> and tomato sauce, and serves it with crisp potato straws, which are considered the traditional side dish for Beef Stroganoff in Russia.

5000|$|Irachi pathiri or Irachi pathil is {{very popular}} in North Malabar and is a very common snack in areas of Thalassery, Vatakara and Malappuram.
