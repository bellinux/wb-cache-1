25|$|In 1945, {{the company}} {{expanded}} its electronics capability through acquisitions {{that included the}} Submarine Signal Company (founded in 1901), a leading manufacturer of maritime safety equipment. With its broadened capabilities, Raytheon developed the first guidance system for a missile that could intercept a flying target. In 1948, Raytheon began to manufacture guided missiles. In 1950, its Lark missile became the first such weapon to destroy a target aircraft in flight. Raytheon then received military contracts to develop the air-to-air Sparrow and ground-to-air Hawk missiles—projects that received impetus from the Korean War. In later decades, it remained a major producer of missiles, among them the Patriot <b>antimissile</b> <b>missile</b> and the air-to-air Phoenix missile. In 1959, Raytheon acquired the marine electronics company Apelco Applied Electronics, which significantly increased its strength in commercial marine navigation and radio gear, as well as less-expensive Japanese suppliers of products such as marine/weather band radios and direction-finding gear. In the same year, it {{changed its name to}} Raytheon Company.|$|E
50|$|Sailing for Hawaii {{following}} {{leave and}} upkeep, Tioga County participated in joint United States Army-United States Navy {{exercises in the}} islands {{before returning to the}} California coast. She conducted local operations and training out of San Diego, on occasion between the U.S. West Coast and the Hawaiian Islands, into 1965. On 31 May 1965 of that year, Tioga County was selected as the test bed for the Sea Sparrow antiaircraft and <b>antimissile</b> <b>missile,</b> and she participated in these tests until June 1965, when she was commended by the Raytheon Corporation for her part {{in the development of the}} missile system.|$|E

40|$|A {{preliminary}} investigation {{was conducted to}} determine whether a warhead stage of an <b>antimissile</b> <b>missile</b> could be placed within an arbitrary 2 -nautical-mile-radius maneuver cylinder around an intercontinental-ballistic-missile (ICBM) flight path above an altitude of 140, 000 feet, a horizontal range of 40 nautical miles, at a flight-path angle of approximately 20 deg, and within 50 seconds after take-off using only aerodynamic forces to turn the <b>antimissile</b> <b>missile.</b> The {{preliminary investigation}} indicated that an <b>antimissile</b> <b>missile</b> using aerodynamic forces for turning was capable of intercepting the ICBM for the stated conditions of this study although the turning must be completed below an altitude of approximately 70, 000 feet to insure that the <b>antimissile</b> <b>missile</b> will be at the desired flight-path angle. Trim lift coefficients on the order of 2 to 3 and a maximum normal-acceleration force of from 25 g to 35 g were necessary to place the warhead stage in intercept position. The preliminary investigation indicated that for the two boosters investigated the booster having a burning time of 10 seconds gave greater range up the ICBM flight path than did the booster having a burning time of 15 seconds for the same trim lift coefficient and required the least trim lift coefficient for the same range...|$|E
