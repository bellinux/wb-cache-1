5|$|The {{story line}} took on many forms during production. His {{original}} idea featured a 30-year-old man dealing with monsters that he {{drew in a}} book as a child coming back to bother him as an adult.

5|$|A {{series of}} safety {{meetings}} were scheduled {{in order to}} prevent accidents on the set. One of the items on the agenda was finding the closest hospital to the set, according to make-up effects coordinator John Vulich. Furthermore, several of the cast and crew members had <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> of snakes, including Manners, David Duchovny, and John Shiban. During one of the days that the show was being prepped, a snake wrangler brought several live rattlesnakes to the set, but one escaped. It was eventually found behind Manners' desk. In order to prevent future accidents, the mouths of the snakes were sutured shut.|$|E
5|$|All species {{experienced}} over-hunting by sealers. The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} experienced population drops in the 19th century and during World War II, and the Caribbean monk seal was exploited since the 1500s until the 1850s, when populations were {{too low to}} hunt commercially. The Mediterranean monk seal has experienced commercial hunting since the Middle Ages and eradication by fishermen. Monk seals have developed <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> of humans, and may even abandon beaches due to human presence. There are currently around 1,700 monk seals in total.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the numbers}} of dogs killed each year are {{relatively}} low, it induces <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs. In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs {{that can be seen}} as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E
5|$|An {{airport at}} Lakselv was first {{proposed}} out of military considerations. Despite a Norwegian neutrality policy, there was <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> that Norway could be occupied by foreign powers {{to take advantage}} of the country's strategic position. The military therefore wanted to construct airfields throughout the country to increase the air force's mobility. Especially Finnmark was regarded as a key location, given the increased Soviet militarization on the Kola Peninsula. Increased military funding was granted from 1937, and the following year, a triangular runway was built at Banak.|$|E

5|$|In June 1886, Holmes {{received}} an honorary degree from Yale University Law School. His wife {{of more than}} forty years, who had struggled with an illness that had kept her an invalid for months, died on February 6, 1888. The younger Amelia died the following year after a brief malady. Despite his weakening eyesight and <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> that he was becoming antiquated, Holmes continued to find solace in writing.

The thirty-five member band performed at Le Suquet in Cannes, in Nice, {{and in front of}} the Prince's Palace of Monaco. After the inaugural trip, the program was dissolved by the joint national councils due to its high cost and low attendance, which was believed to be caused by <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> of traveling abroad after the September 11 attacks.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s {{the breed}} enjoyed much success because the beef market demanded low input (feed) cattle with high quality meat. However, the BSE crisis (commonly {{referred}} to as mad cow disease) caused an export ban in 1990, although there were no cases of BSE found in Galloway cattle. This created <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> associated with cattle, so breed numbers declined.|$|E
5|$|In times past, bright comets often {{inspired}} {{panic and}} hysteria {{in the general}} population, being thought of as bad omens. More recently, during the passage of Halley's Comet in 1910, the Earth passed through the comet's tail, and erroneous newspaper reports inspired <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> that cyanogen in the tail might poison millions, whereas the appearance of Comet Hale–Bopp in 1997 triggered the mass suicide of the Heaven's Gate cult.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the sites}} {{are located in the}} Highlands and Islands. This may be because of the {{relatively}} sparse modern populations and consequent lack of disturbance. Much of the area also has a thick covering of peat that preserves stone fragments, although the associated acidic conditions tend to dissolve organic materials. There are also numerous important remains in the Orkney archipelago, where sand and arable land predominate. Local tradition hints at both <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> and veneration of these ancient structures that may have helped to preserve their integrity.|$|E

5|$|Raëlians {{say they}} {{encourage}} adult homosexual, bisexual, and heterosexual relationships and that society should recognize them legally.

5|$|The {{creation}} {{of nuclear weapons}} arose from scientific and political developments of the 1930s.

The concurrent rise of fascist governments in Europe led to <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> of a German nuclear weapon project, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries. When their calculations showed that nuclear weapons were theoretically feasible, the British and United States governments supported an all-out effort to build them.|$|E
