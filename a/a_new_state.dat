5|$|During Edwards' {{terms as}} {{territorial}} governor, Illinois' population more than tripled, from 12,282 in 1810 to 40,258 in 1818 (a census was finally conducted later that year). The population {{did not meet}} the 60,000 threshold the Northwest Ordinance required for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>state,</b> but both Illinoisans and Congress expected continued growth.|$|E
5|$|The 1964 General Assembly also passed {{legislation}} to draft <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> constitution. Thirty-eight citizens {{were chosen to}} draft the new document, {{which was based on}} national models. County leaders opposed the document because of perceived threats to the independence of local governments and an apparent consolidation of power in Frankfort. Despite Breathitt's strong support, the proposed constitution was defeated by Kentucky voters by an overwhelming margin of 510,099 to 140,210.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>State</b> Route 231 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1988, {{connecting}} I-5 northwest of Irvine with SR 91, and in 1991 the south end was shifted southeast to the north end of SR 133, with the old route becoming SR 261. To prevent the route from changing numbers as it crossed I-5, the southern portion was renumbered SR 133 in 1996, with the remainder becoming an extended SR 241. The Eastern Transportation Corridor, which includes SR 133 north of I-5, was completed on October 15, 1998, opening a new shortcut from Orange County to the northeast.|$|E

5|$|After Leonid Brezhnev assumed {{power in}} 1964, much of Khrushchev's reforms were reversed. The Brezhnev era began <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> of stagnation, {{and saw a}} decline in both the quality and {{quantity}} of products in the Soviet Union. Armenia was severely affected by these policies, as was to be demonstrated several years later in the catastrophic earthquake that hit Spitak. Material allocated to the building of new homes, such as cement and concrete, was diverted for other uses. Bribery and a lack of oversight saw the construction of shoddily built and weakly supported apartment buildings. When the earthquake hit on the morning of December 7, 1988, the houses and apartments least able to resist collapse were those built during the Brezhnev years. Ironically, the older the dwellings, the better they withstood the quake.|$|E
5|$|Agnew's term as {{governor}} {{was marked by}} modestly progressive policies, which included tax reform, clean water regulations, and the repeal of laws against interracial marriage. Community health programs were expanded, as were higher educational and employment opportunities for those on low incomes. Steps were taken towards ending segregation in schools. Agnew's fair housing legislation was limited, applying only to new projects above a certain size. These were the first such laws passed south of the Mason–Dixon line. Agnew's attempt to adopt <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> constitution {{was rejected by the}} voters in a referendum.|$|E
5|$|Breathitt {{obtained}} {{his early}} {{education in the}} public schools of Hopkinsville and graduated from Hopkinsville High School in 1942. Later that year, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force for service in World War II, serving until 1945. After the war, he matriculated to the University of Kentucky. While there, he {{served as president of the}} Omicron Delta Kappa honor society and the Lamp and Cross society; he was also a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon social fraternity. Seeing Breathitt's interest in politics, professors Jack Reeves and Thomas D. Clark asked him to chair the campus campaign supporting <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> constitution. Breathitt accepted, and although the proposed constitution failed, he remained committed to seeing the document updated.|$|E

On March 18, 2009, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled {{it would not}} hear {{arguments}} in the case, effectively ending the legal battle to make his e-mails with Katz public. Corzine spent approximately $127,000 of taxpayer funds to keep the e-mails secret. Nonetheless, on August 1, 2010, The Star-Ledger published 123 of the Corzine-Katz e-mails, revealing {{the extent of their}} personal contact during negotiations over <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> government workers contract in early 2007.|$|E
5|$|Diệm severed {{economic}} relations with France on 9 December 1955, and {{withdrew from the}} French Union shortly afterwards. Neither the Soviet Union nor communist China overtly objected to Diệm's actions in creating <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> in the southern half of Vietnam. Nevertheless, {{by the time of}} Diệm's deposal and assassination in 1963, France bought 46.3% of South Vietnam's exports and accounted for most of the foreign investment in the country. French cultural influences and the language remained prevalent.|$|E
5|$|During the Texas Constitutional Convention of 1868, {{the delegates}} paid {{attention}} to northeastern portion of the state, especially the increasing need {{for the creation of}} new counties in the region. At the time, there were a total of twenty counties located in the region, compared to twenty-three presently. The convention originally met to write <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> constitution, but members quickly tried to shift the focus to other issues. During the convention, the Committee on Counties and County Boundaries presented proposals for the creation of three new counties in the region. They were to be called Delta, Webster, and Richland. Delta County was established on July 29, 1870, by the Twelfth State Legislature. The proposals for Webster and Richland counties, however, were not passed.|$|E

5|$|Having {{successfully}} {{dealt with}} the major challenges and issues involved in forming <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> government, Shelby left the state safe and financially sound. Kentucky's constitution prevented a governor from serving consecutive terms, so Shelby retired to Traveler's Rest, his Lincoln County estate, {{at the conclusion of}} his term in 1796. For the next 15 years he tended to affairs on his farm. He was selected as a presidential elector in six consecutive elections, but these were his only appearances in public life during this period.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> {{constitution}} was created and ratified. Among the constitution's new clauses was {{an extension of}} the terms of representatives to two years and senators to four years. It also made many of the previously appointed positions open to public election. The new constitution delegated many minor tasks to newly created elected offices. With its workload considerably decreased, instead of meeting annually, the General Assembly only convened a session every two years. The new constitution also placed new limits on the General Assembly's power to create local laws, the General Assembly having become notorious for creating state level laws that were only applied to one town or county.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, {{the road}} from Marcellus to Camillus along the Nine Mile Creek route was {{improved}} by the Camillus and Marcellus Plank Road Company, which was first chartered in 1853 and authorized to collect tolls from travelers using the road. The improvement of the road led to it becoming a stagecoach route {{in the middle of}} the 19th century. The former plank road alignment in the village of Marcellus (North Street) and the southward continuation along Cherry Street (now South Street) was paved in 1911 as part of the construction of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> highway that would pass through the town.|$|E

By 1970, SR522 {{was moved to the}} completed Bothell–Monroe highway, retaining the Seattle–Bothell portion, while SR202 was designated to the remaining highway from Woodinville (east of Bothell) to North Bend.|$|E

5|$|Other French {{leaders were}} {{directly}} {{influenced by the}} text of the Declaration of Independence itself. The Manifesto of the Province of Flanders (1790) was the first foreign derivation of the Declaration; others include the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence (1811), the Liberian Declaration of Independence (1847), the declarations of secession by the Confederate States of America (1860–61), and the Vietnamese Proclamation of Independence (1945). These declarations echoed the United States Declaration of Independence in announcing the independence of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>state,</b> without necessarily endorsing the political philosophy of the original.|$|E

5|$|Railroads {{and roads}} in the Sammamish River and Snoqualmie River valleys, where modern-day SR202 runs, were built during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The early roads were {{incorporated}} into the Yellowstone Trail in the 1910s and became a state highway in 1925. SR202 was established in 1964 as part of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> highway system, running from Woodinville to Monroe; SR522 was designated to the Woodinville–North Bend highway, continuing west to Seattle. By 1970, the designations were reversed, with SR202 moved to the Woodinville–North Bend highway, and SR522 moved to the Bothell–Monroe highway.|$|E
5|$|The {{area that}} {{is now known as}} the hamlet of Keene—the modern {{junction}} of NY9N and NY73—was first settled {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century. Many of the early settlers arrived in the region by traveling along a rough and nearly unusable highway connecting what became Keene to Jay in the north and Lewis in the east. By 1810, part of the crude roadway had been supplanted by a privately funded highway leading westward from Westport to at least North Elba and possibly to Saranac Lake by way of Keene. On April5, 1810, the New York State Legislature passed an act establishing <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> highway linking Westport to Hopkinton by way of Keene and Saranac Lake. The highway incorporated the entirety of the pre-existing roadway between Westport and Saranac Lake.|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} {{incident}} {{during this period}} was the Rampur Tiraha firing case {{on the night of}} 1 October 1994, which led to a public uproar.
