500|$|The [...] "Dual Spires enhanced" [...] video at the Psych website lists further {{references}} to Twin Peaks. Shawn's name for Gus in this episode is [...] "Lodge Blackmunn", a direct {{reference to the}} Black and White Lodge. Leo the Cinnamon Owl is a reference to Killer BOB, who possessed Leland Palmer and often {{took the form of}} an owl. The sheriff's deputy is Deputy Frost, named after Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost. The doctors of both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks have coconuts in their offices. Both Paula's and Laura's diaries described meetings with [...] "J". Sheriff Jackson tells Bob he needs to be strong for his wife. Dr Hayward says the same thing to Leland Palmer in Twin Peaks. Upon entering the town Gus mentions that the residents are looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were the first black man they had ever seen. There are very few black men in Twin Peaks. When they enter the Sawmill Diner Bob Barker says [...] "Top of the morning to you." [...] In the first season of Twin Peaks, Pete Martell corrected Josie Packard on the saying. Maudette wears an orchid in her hair; Harold grew orchids in Twin Peaks. In the library Shawn asks if they can [...] "poke around" [...] but he and Gus immediately say [...] "peek" [...] in correction. Thus [...] "peek", as in Twin Peaks, is spoken twice. A man wearing a hat in the Sawmill Diner gives Shawn and Gus a thumbs up. The older room service attendant did the same thing to Agent Cooper in Twin Peaks. A record player is featured prominently in both the Barker and Palmer homes. The Roadhouse was also a location in Twin Peaks. Both Maudette and Audrey Horne love to dance. Paula's friend Jack is completely blind in one eye, referencing Twin Peaks' brothel named [...] "One Eyed Jacks". In the library Shawn and Gus find a book entitled [...] "Putt Your Way to a Better Future." [...] After Leland Palmer killed Maddy Ferguson he was seen putting golf balls around in his living room. When Randy is using the table saw it resembles the sawmill scene from the extended opening credits of Twin Peaks. When Maudette is placed in the body bag it is bent {{in such a way that}} it resembles a smile, like the smiling bag clue Agent Cooper found. On Maudette's desk beside her computer is a roll of green tape like the kind used by Leland Palmer to tie up Jacques Renault. In the cabin Bob Barker lights a match and holds it up like Leland Palmer did when describing BOB to Agent Cooper. Bob Barker wears a gold ring on his pinky, something Agent Cooper did in Twin Peaks. In the cabin the walls are red with red drapes as an allusion to the [...] "Red Room" [...] in Agent Cooper's dream.|$|E
60|$|Smike looked vacantly <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{unable to}} {{comprehend}} his meaning.|$|E
60|$|The King {{continued}} to stare <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were a human curiosity.|$|E
6000|$|Ginger stared <b>at</b> <b>’im</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> ’e couldn’t believe ’is eyes. [...] "Playing?" [...] he ses, feeling ’is face {{very gently}} with {{the tips of}} his fingers.|$|R
60|$|Old Isaac was in {{bed when}} they got there, and the temper 'e was in was shocking; but Ginger sat on 'is bed and smiled <b>at</b> <b>'im</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> 'e was saying {{compliments}} to 'im.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> uneasily, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{his words}} had awakened some half-understood response.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> her soul {{were lost in}} her music, with unseeing eyes.|$|E
60|$|COKESON. [Looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to {{encourage}} him to complete the sentence] A leetle more, sir.|$|E
60|$|Ann {{was still}} looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had {{undergone}} a change into something new and strange.|$|E
60|$|Rose looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> narrowly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to {{find his}} real thought. He stopped {{abruptly}} at her glance.|$|R
60|$|She leapt up <b>at</b> <b>him</b> suddenly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> waking from a dream, and wreathed {{her arms}} about his neck.|$|R
6000|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> pityingly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> still {{recognizing}} his delirium, {{and shook}} her head. [...] "White chief was sick--how can know? Olooya made witch-fire." ...|$|R
60|$|Eugene Wrayburn {{looked on}} <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he found him {{beginning}} to be rather an entertaining study.|$|E
60|$|The Captain looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he {{were half}} {{inclined}} to unburden his {{mind of a}} capital joke.|$|E
60|$|Rosa looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{she would}} have liked him to be the {{recipient}} of a thousand dedications.|$|E
60|$|He was a sharp-looking man, {{tall and}} thin, with screwed-up {{eyes and a}} little red beard. The second day 'e came 'e was up here at this 'ere Cauliflower, having a pint o' beer and looking round at the chaps as he talked to the landlord. The odd thing was that men who'd never taken a hare or a {{pheasant}} in their lives could 'ardly meet 'is eye, while Bob Pretty stared <b>at</b> <b>'im</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> 'e was a wax-works.|$|R
6000|$|... "How did it feel?" [...] asked Chubbins; but {{she looked}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> queerly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> his {{language}} was strange to her, {{and seemed to be}} half frightened.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that I should not come, so," [...] said the stranger, looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> enquiringly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{referring}} to <b>him</b> {{for what it was}} usual to do.|$|R
60|$|Gride looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were petrified with astonishment, {{but did not}} speak; perhaps {{lacking the}} power.|$|E
60|$|The yeoman {{still stood}} {{in a sort of}} trance, gazing <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> unable to tear himself away.|$|E
60|$|Kate {{fell back}} {{a step or}} two, and looked <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> in doubt whether she had heard aright.|$|E
60|$|Pelagia looked tip <b>at</b> <b>him</b> wide-eyed, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{her mind}} was taking in slowly some vast new thought, {{under the weight of}} which it reeled already. Then she rose slowly.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> expectantly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{between them}} they were decorating a small figure of herself, and she saw him hesitating in the {{disposition}} of some bow or sash.|$|R
60|$|Cronshaw looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> slowly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he {{were turning}} the inquiry {{over in his}} mind, and before he {{answered}} rapped on the marble table {{with one of the}} saucers.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were noble. Her {{love for him}} was so generous that it beautified him.|$|E
60|$|The old {{man looked}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were {{curious to know}} what he meant, but scorned to prolong the conversation.|$|E
60|$|She was silent, {{and looked}} wonderingly, a little fearfully, <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> vague, {{disturbing}} thoughts were entering {{the fringe of}} her mind.|$|E
60|$|Allie looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> steadily, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{this was}} the first time she had seen him, but she did not reply. And Larry, easily disconcerted, {{gathered}} up his burden and turned toward camp.|$|R
6000|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> curiously, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to enquire, 'then if you won't have {{to learn}} poetry and you won't get sent to bed, what on earth is there for you to worry about?' ...|$|R
60|$|Deronda {{paused in}} his pleading: his mother looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> listeningly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the cadence {{of his voice}} were taking her ear, yet {{she shook her head}} slowly. He began again, even more urgently.|$|R
60|$|ANN. [looking quickly <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{this were}} a new light] Surely you are not so absurd as to be jealous of Tavy.|$|E
60|$|He {{remained}} quite still, hearing, but washed all wan {{and without}} feeling. She waited, looking <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were some curious, not-understandable creature.|$|E
60|$|While Charlie Brooke was speaking, {{the poor}} invalid was {{breathing}} hard and gazing <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to make quite {{sure it was}} all true.|$|E
60|$|His interruptress {{stopped and}} looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> again, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she thought <b>him</b> a very odd person; but she seemed amused. Now, at any rate, she was not frightened. She seemed even {{disposed}} to provoke him a little.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> timidly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{she were}} afraid {{he might not}} think it good enough; {{she did not think}} it good enough for him, but she felt that they must make their money go as far as possible.|$|R
60|$|On drawing near to {{the outer}} edge of the woods he stooped slightly, and trod with the extreme caution of an Indian. Indeed, no red man could have beaten Ian at woodcraft--except, of course, in the matter of shooting. He felt this defect keenly as he glided along, but never faltered for an instant. Elsie smiled <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> visibly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she had been there. His mind was made up.|$|R
