5|$|After {{experiencing}} {{chest pains}} following the team's 27–17 {{victory over the}} New Orleans Saints on December 13, Reeves underwent quadruple bypass surgery. The team was coached by defensive coordinator Rich Brooks for the final two regular season games. Reeves was {{able to return to}} the team in time for their first playoff game, in which the Falcons beat their division rival, the San Francisco 49ers, to clinch a spot in the Conference Championship. Despite an impressive season, they were not expected to match up well against the Vikings, who had beaten teams by an average of 23.22 points <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>that</b> year and were installed as 11-point favorites for the Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|In case {{of failure}} with PVS, {{spermatozoa}} are sometimes collected by electroejaculation: an electrical probe is {{inserted into the}} rectum, where it triggers ejaculation. The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and {{does not have the}} potential to be done <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>that</b> PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm. If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by testicular sperm extraction or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. These procedures yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.|$|E

As she uses the telephone to call police, the Phantom breaks through the screen door and shoots her twice in the face. Despite her wounds, she drags herself {{out of the house and}} into a cornfield while the Phantom inspects Floyd's body. The Phantom stalks her with a pickaxe, but leaves when she gets help at a nearby house. News of this attack causes the town to panic, and people begin boarding up their windows.|$|E
5|$|Texas scored {{first when}} Selvin Young ran {{the ball in}} for a touchdown. The extra point attempt by Richmond McGee was no good. The Cajuns were able to score threepoints on a field goal by Sean Comiskey making the score Texas 6, Louisiana Lafayette 3. Texas replied with 54unanswered points {{to win the game}} 60–3. With the win, Texas {{improved}} its record in season-opening games to 93–17–3 and 72–2–2 when they open the year <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> <b>That</b> figure includes 11straight wins and victories in 30of their last 31games at home.

5|$|Oregon {{then began}} a 10-game winning streak, their longest {{since the start}} of the 1937–38 season. Oregon State was the Webfoots' first {{opponent}} during the streak, on January 13; Oregon prevailed 31–26. In two higher-scoring contests at Washington State on January 17 and 18, the Webfoots claimed 56–44 and 57–31 victories, respectively. A five-game road trip concluded with games in Idaho on January 20 and 21. The contests were closer than those against Washington State, but the Webfoots won 38–30 in the first game and 35–31 in the second to improve to 6–1 in conference play. Oregon's next five games were at home, beginning with a second encounter against Oregon State, on January 27 that they won by a seven-point margin. Washington traveled to Oregon for games on January 31 and February 1, and 57–49 and 58–42 victories moved the Webfoots' winning streak to eight. They then concluded their four-game season series with Idaho, winning by 17 points in each game. On February 18, the Webfoots' streak ended with a 50–31 upset loss to Oregon State, which would be their last of the season. Six days later, Oregon posted a 48–37 win over the Beavers <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> <b>That</b> game was the Webfoots' last appearance for the 1938–39 regular season at McArthur Court; it was the school's 100th win at the arena since it was opened in 1927.|$|E

25|$|To {{start the}} series, Penguins goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury shut-out Tampa Bay 3–0 in game one, with the Lightning {{responding}} with a 5–1 win in game two.

In game seven, Lightning forward Sean Bergenheim scored about five minutes into the second period.

25|$|Until his death, Borel {{attended}} the lycée professionnel Georges-Cisson in Toulon, {{where he studied}} electromechanics and did quite well academically.

He skipped classes without permission or explanation and became unaffable. He regularly said that he could not bear it anymore <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> <b>that</b> he had had enough of doing housework and being called names, and often stated his wish to join the military, like his father and grandfather. Apparently, the week prior to the shooting, he also told one of his classmates that he would commit suicide, but not before killing two or three people.|$|E

At that time, confronting criticism <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>that</b> the United States was getting more deeply involved in the factional violence in Somalia without a clear rationale, Aspin explained that U.S. troops would remain until order had been restored in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, progress had been made in disarming rival clans, and effective police forces were operating in the country's major cities. At the same time the United States increased its military efforts against a leading Somali warlord, Mohamed Farrah Aidid.|$|E

25|$|In July 2012 Ofcom {{consulted}} on {{a scheme}} proposed by Royal Mail to alter its delivery obligations to allow larger postal items {{to be left}} with neighbours rather than returning them to a Royal Mail office to await collection. The scheme was presented as offering consumers greater choice for receiving mail when not <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> <b>that</b> is if Royal Mail deliver items as per their stated contractual obligations and was said to follow Royal Mail research from a 'delivery to neighbour' trial across six areas of the UK that showed widespread consumer satisfaction. In a statement dated 27 September 2012, Ofcom announced it would approve the scheme after noting that more goods were being purchased over the internet and that Royal Mail's competitors were permitted to leave undelivered items with neighbours. People who {{do not wish to}} have parcels left with neighbours, or to receive those of others, can opt out by displaying a free opt-out sticker near their letterbox. Royal Mail remains liable for undeliverable items until they are received by the addressee or returned to sender.|$|E
25|$|Torquay {{started the}} 2014–15 {{season in the}} National League poorly losing to Gateshead 1–3 with Ryan Bowman missing a penalty. After that match Torquay had a {{brilliant}} unbeaten run, first beating Welling United 3–0 then drawing 0–0 with Southport and then with Dartford. Yet another draw came when they drew with Aldershot Town 1–1 <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> <b>That</b> was their last draw for a while as they went on a six-game unbeaten run. Starting with a 1–3 away win at Lincoln City then playing at home beating Nuneaton Town 4–0, they were 3–0 up after 30 minutes. The Gulls {{then went on to}} win two away games winning 0–2 in both of them. First winning at Chester then Grimsby (manager Chris Hargreaves' home town). The next game was a home game that was looking to be a 0–0 draw until the 90th minute when can The Gulls captain Luke Young scored an incredible 35 yard free kick to give Torquay the 3 points. A 2–0 win at home against Dover followed, however this was {{to be the end of}} Torquay's 10 game unbeaten run and an indifferent run-in would see United end the season in 13th position.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007, Roeder joined Championship side Norwich City, {{signing a}} {{contract}} until 2010, with Norwich {{bottom of the}} division and four points adrift of safety. His first game in charge was on 4 November in the East Anglian Derby against Ipswich Town, a match that ended 2–2 after Norwich had been 2–0 down at half-time. His first win came in the home game against Coventry City (24 November), which he followed up with a first away win of the season for Norwich in the 3-1 defeat of fellow strugglers Blackpool (27 November), who previously had not lost <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>that</b> season. He then guided the team out of the relegation zone with wins over Plymouth Argyle, Sheffield United, Scunthorpe United, Barnsley, Southampton, Preston North End and Cardiff City. The Canaries rose rapidly up the table {{as a result of}} this good run of form and, at one stage, it looked as though they could make a shock late burst into the play-offs, similar to the run under Nigel Worthington in the 2001/2002 season. Roeder began an overhaul of the squad in the January transfer window, releasing players such as Julien Brellier and David Strihavka who had been signed by his predecessor and who he did not consider to have a future at the club. He made the loan signing of Matty Pattison permanent and also renewed the loan deals for Ched Evans and Mo Camara. Roeder also made four loan signings including Matthew Bates, Keiran Gibbs, Alex Pearce and James Henry. Despite a poor run of form through February and March, Roeder kept Norwich in the Championship for another season, though survival was not confirmed until a 3-0 home win against QPR in the penultimate fixture of the season.|$|E
