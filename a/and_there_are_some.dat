5|$|Intrigued by {{an ominous}} figure {{in one of}} Vincent van Gogh's paintings, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) {{go back in time}} to meet Van Gogh (Tony Curran) and discover that Provence has been plagued by an invisible monster, known as the Krafayis, which only Van Gogh can see. The Doctor and Amy work with Van Gogh to defeat the Krafayis, but in their attempt to have Van Gogh realise his legacy through bringing him to the future they ultimately realise that not all of time can be rewritten <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> evils which are out of the Doctor's reach.|$|E
5|$|Tactile ASL (TASL) is {{a variety}} of ASL used {{throughout}} the United States by and with the deaf-blind. It is particularly common among those with Usher's syndrome. This syndrome results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life; consequently, those with Usher's syndrome often {{grow up in the}} Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL. TASL differs from ASL in that signs are produced by touching the palms, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate for the lack of non-manual signing.|$|E
5|$|Leggetts Creek {{flows through}} a water gap known as Leggetts Gap or The Notch. The gap is {{cut through the}} West or Lackawanna Mountain Range by the creek. There have been some culm banks along the creek and {{historic}} mining operations such as those at the Marvine #6 Colliery have affected it. The creek's headwaters are in wetlands surrounded by residential development. There is riprap on the creek in Leggetts Gap as it flows near major highways in this stretch. It typically has a natural channel in part of its lower reaches <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> reaches with gradual slopes. However, {{in some parts of}} the creek's lower reaches, fill has been dumped onto its banks, creating steep slopes. The creek has been channelized in South Abington Township.|$|E

5|$|The {{standard}} {{word order}} is, {{as in most}} Germanic languages, V2, {{which means that the}} finite verb (V) appears in second position (2) of a declarative main clause. Swedish morphology is similar to English; that is, words have comparatively few inflections. There are two genders, no grammatical cases (except for pronouns), and a distinction between plural and singular. Older analyses posit the cases nominative and genitive <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> remains of distinct accusative and dative forms as well. Adjectives are compared as in English, and are also inflected according to gender, number and definiteness. The definiteness of nouns is marked primarily through suffixes (endings), complemented with separate definite and indefinite articles. The prosody features both stress and in most dialects tonal qualities. The language has a comparatively large vowel inventory. Swedish is also notable for the voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative, a highly variable consonant phoneme.|$|E
5|$|This {{crocodile}} is to {{be found}} in the freshwater swamps, marshes and lakes of New Guinea, particularly in the interior. It has been known to enter brackish waters such as those of the Fly River estuary but is very rare in coastal areas, and never found in the presence of the competing saltwater crocodile (C. porosus). The animal was first described from the Sepik River area in the north of Papua New Guinea. A separate population is found in the southern half of the island, with a range that extends from southeastern Papua New Guinea to the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. It is separated from the northern population by the New Guinea Highlands, a mountain range that runs along the centre of the island. DNA analysis has revealed these to be genetically separate populations, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> differences in their morphology and behavior. There are estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000 New Guinea crocodiles in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Barn owls {{living in}} {{tropical}} regions can breed {{at any time}} of year, but some seasonality in nesting is still evident. Where there are distinct wet and dry seasons, egg-laying usually takes place during the dry season, with increased rodent prey becoming available to the birds as the vegetation dies off. In arid regions, such as parts of Australia, breeding may be irregular and may happen in wet periods, triggered by temporary increases in the populations of small mammals. In temperate climates, nesting seasons become more distinct <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> seasons of the year when no egg-laying takes place. In Europe and North America, most nesting takes place between March and June when temperatures are increasing. The actual dates of egg-laying vary by year and by location, being correlated with the amount of prey-rich foraging habitat around the nest site and often with the phase of the rodent abundance cycle. An increase in rodent populations will usually stimulate the local barn owls to begin nesting; thus, even in the cooler parts of its range, two broods are often raised in a good year.|$|E
