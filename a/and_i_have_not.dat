500|$|Despite {{the various}} changes from real-life events, Abagnale {{believed}} Spielberg {{was the only}} filmmaker who [...] "could do this film justice". However, Abagnale had little involvement with the film. In November 2001, he had [...] "never met nor spoken to Steven Spielberg <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> read the script. I prefer not to. I understand that they now portray my father in a better light, as he really was. Steven Spielberg has told the screenplay writer (Jeff Nathanson) that he wants complete accuracy in the relationships and actual scams that I perpetrated", Abagnale reported. [...] "I hope {{in the end the}} movie will be entertaining, exciting, funny and bring home an important message about family, childhood and divorce".|$|E
500|$|On November 11 (with UT {{holding an}} 8-1 record) Heisman voter Rodney Gilmore of ESPN.com had McCoy listed third of five Heisman candidates. Gilmore said, [...] "I love his numbers (78 percent {{completion}} percentage, 28 touchdowns, only 7 interceptions and 2,879 yards) and his gutsy second-half performance against Texas Tech. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> forgotten about his epic performance against Oklahoma {{just a few}} weeks ago. However, Harrell outplayed McCoy head-to-head in the showdown last week, so Harrell has a leg up on him for now, but McCoy is within striking distance." [...] That same day, the Rocky Mountain News poll listed Harrell first and McCoy second in their weekly poll of 10 Heisman voters. Harrell received 44 points and 7 first-place votes while McCoy had 34 points and 2 first-place votes.|$|E
500|$|On Bennett's {{return to}} London {{he took up}} a {{teaching}} post at the RAM which he held until 1858. During his second long stay in Germany, from October 1838 to March 1839, he played his Fourth Piano Concerto (Op. 19, in F minor) and the Wood Nymphs Overture, Op. 20. Returning to England, {{he wrote to his}} Leipzig publisher Friedrich Kistner in 1840, bemoaning the difference between England and Germany (and hoping that a German would redress the situation): You know what a dreadful place England is for music; and in London I have nobody who I can talk to about such things, all the people are mad with [...] Thalberg and [...] Strauss , <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> heard a single Symphony or Overture in one concert since last June. I sincerely hope that Prince Albert... will do something to improve our taste.|$|E

500|$|The Stone Tape was a {{significant}} influence on John Carpenter's 1987 film Prince of Darkness in which {{a group of scientists}} investigate a mysterious cylinder discovered {{in the basement of a}} church. Besides directing the film, Carpenter wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym [...] "Martin Quatermass", and included a reference to [...] "Kneale University". This homage did little to impress Kneale, who wrote in The Observer, [...] "For the record I have had nothing to do with the film <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> seen it. It sounds pretty bad. With an homage like this, one might say, who needs insults? I can only imagine that it is a whimsical riposte for my having my name removed from a film I wrote a few years ago [...] and which Mr Carpenter carpentered into sawdust". The play also influenced the 1982 Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper film Poltergeist. In the 2004 BBC7 Radio Serial [...] "Ghost Zone", a character refers explicitly to the [...] "Stone Tape theory" [...] as an explanation for the way an invading alien intelligence is [...] "replaying" [...] scenes and figures from the past of the remote Scottish village in which the story is set. Author Marty Ross has explicitly acknowledged the influence of Kneale's work, and the Quatermass serials in particular, on his own BBC SF drama.|$|E

In addition, during {{the final days of the}} campaign the Liberals attempted to attract strategic NDP and Green votes to stop the Conservatives, and the Conservatives attempted to attract Bloc votes to stop the Liberals.|$|E
2500|$|Bill White, Mayor of Houston in 2006, {{said during}} that year that Kingwood had [...] "a great fire and EMS service {{with one of}} our best captains in the Kingwood area, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> gotten any {{complaints}} about fire and EMS response times, {{which is one of the}} best in the nation." [...] In 2006 Mike Fuhre, the former chief of the Kingwood VFD, criticized HFD for allocating fewer staff and pieces of equipment to Kingwood than had existed during the existence of the VFD. Fuhre said that there were occasions when Kingwood had no coverage because all of the firefighters were called to other locations, and still do.|$|E

2500|$|The {{recording}} of [...] "Sympathy for the Devil", {{as well as}} tension between him and Rose, led Slash to quit the band officially in October 1996. Rose sent a fax notifying MTV of Slash's departure, with Slash responding [...] "Axl <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been capable of seeing eye to eye on Guns N' Roses for some time. We tried to collaborate, but at this point, I'm {{no longer in the}} band." [...] Slash also stated, [...] "Axl's whole visionary style, as far as his input in Guns N' Roses, is completely different from mine. I just like to play guitar, write a good riff, go out there and play, as opposed to presenting an image." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{this same}} time, Warren's {{division}} under Lockwood had become lost wandering on unfamiliar farm roads. Despite having dispatched Lockwood explicitly, the V Corps commander wrote to Meade, [...] "In some unaccountable way, [...] took his whole division, without my knowing it, {{away from the}} left of the line of battle, and turned up the dark 2 miles in my rear, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> yet got him back. All this time the firing should have guided him at least. He is too incompetent, and too high rank leaves us no subordinate place for him. I earnestly beg that he may at once be relieved of duty with this army." [...] Meade relieved Lockwood and replaced him with Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford.|$|E
2500|$|With the band's {{failure to}} {{collaborate}} resulting in no album being recorded, Slash announced in October 1996 {{that he was}} no longer a part of Guns N' Roses. Slash stated at the time [...] "Axl <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been capable of seeing eye to eye on Guns N' Roses for some time. We tried to collaborate, but at this point, I'm no longer in the band." [...] Paul Tobias's inclusion in the band was another factor in Slash leaving, with Slash having both [...] "creative and personal" [...] differences with Tobias. However, in his 2007 autobiography, Slash stated that his decision to leave the band was not based on artistic differences with Axl Rose, but on Rose's constant lateness to concerts, the alleged legal manipulation Rose used (since denied by Rose) to gain control of the band; and the departures of Steven Adler and Izzy Stradlin.|$|E

2500|$|In 1555 or 1556, Le Testu {{published}} a world atlas entitled Cosmographie Universelle selon les Navigateurs, tant anciens que modernes and was consequently awarded {{the title of}} Pilote Royale by Henry II. The Cosmographie Universelle contained 56 maps reportedly based on charts Le Testu had personally drawn by hand on his expeditions. This atlas was dedicated to his mentor and patron Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, who had become leader of the Huguenots three years earlier. The manuscript was based on charts from French, Spanish and Portuguese sources supplied by Coligny. Included in this atlas were twelve charts of Jave le Grand/Terra Australis, which Le Testu located southward of the Moluccas. Le Testu commented: [...] "However, what I have marked and depicted is only by imagination, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> noted or remarked {{on any of the}} commodities or incommodities of the place, nor its mountains, rivers or other things; for there has never yet been any man who has made a certain discovery of it." [...] Coligny subsequently supported a proposal from the d'Albagno brothers, for an expedition to Terra Australis to investigate the possibility of a French colony there.|$|E
2500|$|Maggie Stands Looking, a {{daughter}} of Oglala Lakota Chief American Horse, {{was among the first}} wave of children brought from Rosebud and one of Captain Pratt's model students. Maggie had difficulty adjusting to the demands of her new lifestyle at Carlisle, and once slapped Miss Hyde, the matron, when Hyde insisted that Maggie make her bed every day and keep her room clean. Instead of retaliating, Miss Hyde stood her ground and Maggie acquiesced. Like most of the Carlisle students, Maggie was enrolled in the Summer Outing Program. After her arrival to her country home, Maggie wrote a letter to Pratt. [...] "Dear Captain Pratt: What shall I do? I have been here two weeks <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> bathed. These folks have no bath place. Your school daughter, Maggie Stands Looking." [...] Pratt advised her to do as he had done on the frontier and signed his letter [...] "Your friend and school father. R.H. Pratt." [...] Maggie replied, [...] "After filling a wash basin with water and rubbing myself well, have had a bath that made me feel as good as jumping into a river." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maugham's father, Robert Ormond Maugham, was {{a lawyer}} who handled the legal affairs of the British embassy in Paris. Since French law {{declared}} that all children born on French soil could be conscripted for military service, his father arranged for Maugham to be born at the embassy, technically on British soil. His grandfather, another Robert, was a prominent lawyer and co-founder of the Law Society of England and Wales. Maugham refers to this grandfather's writings in Chapter 6 his literary memoir, The Summing Up: [...] "...in the catalogue of the Library at the British Museum {{there is a long}} list of his legal works. [...] He wrote only one book that was not of this character. [...] It was a collection of essays that he had contributed to the solid magazines of the day and he issued it, as became his sense of decorum, anonymously. I once had the book in my hands, a handsome volume bound in calf, but I never read it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been able to get hold of a copy since. [...] I wish I had, for I might have learnt from it something of the kind of man he was." [...] His family assumed Maugham and his brothers would be lawyers. His elder brother, Viscount Maugham, enjoyed a distinguished legal career and served as Lord Chancellor from 1938 to 1939.|$|E
