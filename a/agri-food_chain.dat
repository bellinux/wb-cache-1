The paper examines the pork, beef, poultry, and milk <b>agri-food</b> <b>chains</b> generally from May 2004 to June 2011. The time series of selected variables contain biweekly, monthly or annual data and, according to data availability, contain a different number of observations within the selected period. The first part of the paper is focused on a descriptive analysis of the selected <b>agri-food</b> <b>chains.</b> Long-term developments and short-term fluctuations in production, supply and consumption, being the main factors which influence price level, are examined in particular. The second part of the paper is focused on vertical price transmission in the selected agri-food chains; specifically, the relationship between farm-gate price and wholesale price is examined and explained. For this purpose multivariate time series analysis is employed, namely the VAR and VECM models. Based on the empirical analysis, it could be concluded that the assumed long-term relationship was not confirmed for all analyzed <b>agri-food</b> <b>chains.</b> On the other hand, imperfect competition was confirmed; even its form may differ among the analyzed <b>agri-food</b> <b>chains.</b> However, generally speaking, one could say that wholesalers have a stronger position than farmers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{examination}} of the selected time series and {{an examination of}} price transmission in the selected <b>agri-food</b> <b>chain.</b> The analysis is connected with the working question of whether the selection of time series influences the results of price transmission. The analysis is focused on the pork <b>agri-food</b> <b>chain</b> in the Czech Republic; the time series of farm-gate price, wholesale price and consumer price is examined. First of all, the main properties of the selected time series are examined; subsequently, price transmissions based on time series of different frequency and in different periods are analyzed. The price transmission analysis is based on multivariate time series analysis; to be precise, the Vector error correction model and co-integration analysis are employed. The analysis shows that the choice of time series of different frequency should not significantly influence the results of price transmission, whereas the choice of time period might be crucial.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to present a {{conceptual}} overview of the price transmissions within <b>agri‐food</b> supply <b>chains.</b> Analyzing price transmission in <b>agri‐food</b> supply <b>chains</b> is essential since imperfect price transition may result in market power. This is an important issue that needs attention, given that the structure of agri‐food retail in Europe, USA and Canada is experiencing rapid change towards retail power. Design/methodology/approach – The conceptual overview draws on a review of different approaches in analyzing transmission of prices through an <b>agri‐food</b> supply <b>chain</b> based on supply chain analysis and price transmission studies. Findings – Three key challenges are identified in analyzing price transmission in agri‐food supply chains: structure of the supply chain; factors affecting price transmission; and supply response.

40|$|Due to {{the effects}} of {{uncertain}} factors such as seasonal weather and plant/animal diseases, the output of agricultural production is uncertain given certain agricultural inputs. This paper addresses the issue of coordinating <b>agri-food</b> <b>chain</b> with perishable goods by revenue-sharing (RS) contract when both output and demand are random. Following a RS contract, a supplier decides on agricultural input (e) and deliveries all goods with a price (ω) lower than unit production cost to the retailer while a retailer decides on the retail price (p) and return 1 –Φ share (percentage) of its revenue to the supplier. For such a contract, the necessary condition of coordinating the chain is that the expected revenue function is concave. Under the channel coordination, the relationship between RS contract parameters ω and Φ as well as the range of Φ are given. For both output and demand random factor with uniform distribution, the concavity of the expected revenue function is presented. A numerical example illustrates the correctness of our analysis. The results of numerical example show that RS contract is able to coordinate the <b>agri-food</b> <b>chain</b> when the expected revenue function is concave. The results also show that the optimal decisions of p and e are closely related to the demand price elasticity and the range of Φ is widened when the expected output increases. <b>Agri-food</b> <b>chain,</b> coordination, revenue-sharing contract, stochastic output, stochastic demand...|$|E

The empirical analysis {{is based on a}} qualitative assessment of 28 expert interviews conducted in summer/autumn 2005. The findings suggest that trust is more pronounced among SMEs which are characterised by the existence of personal relationships between business partners. However, as is clear for pork breeders, if a source of distrust exists, trust may not fully develop. Also, if the general economic situation is difficult, the development of trust may be hampered, because all chain participants are struggling to command a share of a diminishing margin within the chain. Finally, if economic power is distributed unevenly, {{as is the case in}} Germany, Ireland, Spain and the UK where retailers dominate most chains, trust towards the more powerful may be limited. trust, economic relationships, EU, <b>agri-food</b> <b>chains,</b> Agribusiness,...|$|R

40|$|Agri-food {{chains are}} complex systems {{involving}} multiple multifaceted firms usually working together within specific industry sectors (e. g. grains, beef, wool, dairy) to satisfy an increasingly globalised market demand for high value food products. In so doing, the groupings of companies {{involved in an}} <b>agri-food</b> <b>chain</b> undertake activities that require multidimensional inter-organisational and cross organisational decision-making {{in the process of}} adding value to a raw commodity product through the production, manufacturing and distribution stages of the chain. Additional complexity is added by climate variability which impacts randomly and unpredictably on decision making in every component of the chain. The work outlined in this paper is a pilot investigation looking at a number of approaches to conceptualising and modelling an <b>agri-food</b> <b>chain</b> and its related decision making processes to better evaluate the impact and effects of that decision making and associated information flows across the components of the agri-food chains. The modelling approaches were (i) a multimedia model initially explored as an opportunity to visualise supply and value chain issues for educational purposes; (ii) an agent based model (ABM) using deterministic rules to architecturally synthesise a supply chain, and (iii) a baysian belief network (BBN) which we discuss as an approach for looking at the likelihood of certain decisions being made under certain scenarios.

40|$|Nowadays, <b>agri-food</b> <b>chains</b> {{are more}} global {{than ever and}} are {{characterized}} by increased imports and exports and global sourcing of products, resulting in increased cross-border transaction risks. The objective {{of this paper is}} to identify the typical risks regarding <b>agri-food</b> supply <b>chains</b> involved in cross-border transactions and to assess their importance as perceived by agri-food managers. The analysis takes into consideration four different agrifood value chains (meat, grain, olive oil, fresh vegetables and fruits). Following an explorative approach and a qualitative technique, a series of face to face in-depth interviews was conducted. Results indicate that risk perception may be quite different across countries, value chains, tiers of the supply chain, as well as across respondents. The prevalence of Market dynamics risks was pointed out in most of the interviews, yielding the impression that many operators identify the market as the most difficult environment. Differences in risk perception between fresh produce (fruit/vegetables and meat) and processed food chains (grain and olive oil) are probably interrelated to the different degree of integration within these supply chains, the different level of standardization achieved and the different causes of risks that are inherent to the nature of the product.

40|$|Purpose – Chinese <b>agri-food</b> <b>chains</b> {{consist of}} the {{millions}} of small scale farmers, who are not well structured and organized in the supply chain. Owing to market liberalization and globalization, one of the most challenging issues along <b>agri-food</b> <b>chains</b> in China is becoming the issue of how to link these small-scale farmers into the modern chains. Consequently, it is essential for both policy makers and private sectors to understand the governance structure in <b>agri-food</b> supply <b>chains.</b> Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to develop a theoretical framework for supply chain governance, including its antecedents and consequences, as well as a series of hypotheses for empirical testing. Design/methodology/approach – A conceptual framework of chain governance is proposed in this study, where governance structure consists of two dimensions: contractual governance and relational governance. The study intends to propose a complementary relationship between contracts and relational aspects, such as trust, in the Chinese context. Future research is needed to empirically test this model. Findings – The proposed conceptual model is unique, since the majority of the articles addressing this topic focuses on contract farming while limited research touches upon the issues of trust and relations. However, a combination of both contracting and relationships are seldom addressed.
