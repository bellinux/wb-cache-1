50|$|<b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> of {{scenario}} {{planning in}} organizational settings is its weak integration into other planning and forecasting techniques. Most companies {{have plenty of}} trouble dealing with just one future, let alone multiple ones. Typically, budgeting and planning systems are predicated on single views of the future, with adjustments made as necessary through variance analysis, contingency planning, rolling budgets, and periodic renegotiations. The weaknesses of these traditional approaches were very evident after the tragic attack of September 11, 2001 when many companies became paralyzed and quite a few just threw away the plan and budget. Their strategies were not future-proof and they lacked organized mechanisms to adjust to external turmoil. In cases of crisis, leadership becomes important but so does some degree of preparedness. Once the scenarios are finished, the real works starts of how to craft flexible strategies and appropriate monitoring systems. Managers need a simple but comprehensive compass to navigate uncertainty from beginning to end. Scenario planning is just one component of a more complete management system. The point is that scenario thinking needs to be integrated with the existing planning and budgeting system, as awkward as this fit may be. The reality is that most organizations do not handle uncertainty well and that researchers have not provided adequate answers about how to plan under conditions of high uncertainty and complexity.|$|E
5000|$|Structural {{solutions}} {{change the}} rules of the game either through modifying the social dilemma or removing the dilemma altogether. Field research on conservation behaviour has shown that selective incentives in the form of monetary rewards are effective in decreasing domestic water and electricity use. Furthermore, numerous experimental and case studies show that cooperation is more likely based on a number of factors, including whether or not individuals have the ability to monitor the situation, to punish or [...] "sanction" [...] defectors, if they are legitimized by external political structures to cooperate and self-organize, can communicate with one another and share information, know one another, have effective arenas for conflict resolution, and are managing social and ecological systems that have well-defined boundaries or are easily monitorable. [...] Yet implementation of reward and punishment systems can be problematic for various reasons. First, there are significant costs associated with creating and administering sanction systems. Providing selective rewards and punishments requires support institutions to monitor the activities of both cooperators and non-cooperators, which can be quite expensive to maintain. Second, these systems are themselves public goods because one can enjoy the benefits of a sanctioning system without contribution to its existence. The police, army, and judicial system will fail to operate unless people are willing to pay taxes to support them. This raises the question if many people want to contribute to these institutions. Experimental research suggests that particularly low trust individuals are willing to invest money in punishment systems. A considerable portion of people are quite willing to punish non-cooperators even if they personally do not profit. Some researchers even suggest that altruistic punishment is an evolved mechanism for human cooperation. <b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> is that punishment and reward systems might undermine people’s voluntary cooperative intention. Some people get a [...] "warm glow" [...] from cooperation and the provision of selective incentives might crowd out their cooperative intention. Similarly the presence of a negative sanctioning system might undermine voluntary cooperation. Some research has found that punishment systems decrease the trust that people have in others. Other research has found that graduated sanctions, where initial punishments have low severity, make allowances for unusual hardships, and allow the violator to reenter the trust of the collective, have been found to support collective resource management and increase trust in the system., ...|$|E

Furthermore, higher levels of VDBP may limit the bioavailability of the free and bioactive vitamin [50]. Because of this complexity, future studies of vitamin D deficiency and outcomes in ICU may wish to measure both serial vitamin D levels and VDBP.|$|R

A memory mechanism could be inserted in order to avoid requesting labels for concepts that were learned in the past.|$|E
30|$|This {{study has}} some limitations. One {{is that this}} study merged all types of lung cancer, and the {{findings}} could not be expressed purely for any specific type of lung cancer. Second, we could not use the “duration of cancer” variable in this study, {{because most of the}} patients were newly diagnosed, but this may be strength of the study too. <b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> was the lack of FLIC scale in the questionnaire battery, due to the unavailability of a validated Turkish version (Ganz et al. 1991). Finally, we could not run stratified analyses of the treatment arms due to the sample size, so the conclusions of this study may not be generalisable to all types of LC or treatments.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{implementation}} of environmental accounting in a Natural Reserve produced some significant results {{in terms of}} restrictions. First of all, environmental accounting introduced a limitation in scale, which was inapplicable on a micro scale. A second restriction concerned the physical unit measure that was used instead of a monetary unit measure. Finally, <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> {{was related to the}} fact that environmental accounting only takes costs into account, and not environmental benefits. These three limitations led us to develop an environmental accounting model that considered both consumed and produced resources in the Natural Reserve.

40|$|Statements {{about the}} {{underlying}} mechanism of emotion induced eating {{can be divided}} into two different views. Emotional eating {{can be seen as a}} lack of self control (automatic/unintentional reaction) or as an affect regulation strategy (well-considered/cognitive based reaction). The following question is answered: What is the effect of an unconscious and conscious negative affect on unhealthy eating behavior? Sixtyfour women participated and were divided into the conditions 'subliminal', 'supraliminal' and 'conscious'. A negative affect was induced by negative loaded pictures. The dependent variable is 'eating behavior', measured by the amount of snacks participants consumed. The results showed no significant difference between the conditions in eating behavior. In consequence, this investigation does not tell whether emotion induced eating is the result of a lack of self control or affect regulation. Possible explanations are the lack of negative affect and/or the mediation of <b>a</b> <b>third</b> variable. Methodological <b>limitations</b> are the absence of a control group and funnel debriefing, and the lack of external validity...|$|R
30|$|As {{always in}} research, {{this study has}} {{limitations}} and needs follow-up in other studies. First, a larger sample of schools {{would allow us to}} include more variables (e.g. control variables). Since the preferred ratio of valid cases to independent variables for logistic regression is 20 to 1, {{only a limited number of}} variables could be included in this study. In this regard, future research should use a larger sample to test the findings of this study. A second limitation is that we only interviewed principals to gain insight in the HR architecture for new teachers. Although we made use of multiple data sources (i.e. teachers and principals) in order to reduce common method bias, we believe that interviews with teachers and actors at the meso-level and/or direct observation of principals might offer further important information to measure the existent HR architecture. The latter is interesting because what principals say, practice or, apply can be discrepant from what teachers (or other actors) experience (Wright and Nishii 2007). <b>A</b> <b>third</b> methodological <b>limitation</b> that should be taken into account is the cross sectional nature of this study which does not allow to confirm the suggested causality between the principal’s leadership style and configuration of HR practices. More longitudinal research is necessary to study this relationship. A final limitation is that our sample was limited to Flemish primary schools. It would be useful to involve samples from different educational levels since previous research showed HR practices are different (Devos et al. 2004) and leadership effects are stronger at the elementary than secondary school level (Louis et al. 2010). Moreover, this study was carried out in Flanders. It is possible that the specific educational context of Flemish education influences the way principals configure their HR practices. Therefore, it is important to verify the study results in other national or regional contexts.|$|R

30|$|<b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> {{contains}} the categorization of the occupational career patterns. For the categorization of the OCPs, seven {{points in time}} {{over a period of}} 30  years were considered. What specifically happened between the prevailing successive points of time with regard to the occupation was not taken into consideration in this study. The categorization of the career patterns was carried out with the ISCO- 08 classification. By doing this, only the occupational main group was considered. Stability in terms of the occupational main group {{does not mean that the}} job had not been changed. There is also the problem of the ceiling effect: The higher the occupation is rated, the smaller the probability of advancement. The ISCO classification describes occupational classes; however, it places more emphasis on evaluating the educational level and the occupational status.|$|E
30|$|<b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> {{pertains}} {{to the impact of}} time on the effect sizes of the sunk-cost effect in progress decisions. Although we only included studies that explicitly manipulate sunk costs, we are aware that our meta-analysis cannot disentangle the sunk-cost effect from other drivers of escalation tendencies. We attribute this to two reasons: first, funding can increase with project time, especially in scenario-based studies with multiple-linked progress decisions. Second, all studies analyzed involve monetary sunk costs, but we cannot rule out that other resources, such as time or effort, might also be invested as the project continues. We leave this issue for further research. Other than these shortcomings, our detailed discussion of sunk-cost effects with respect to utilization and progress decisions offers fruitful insights for further academic discussion.|$|E

40|$|For the {{improved}} production of vaccines and therapeutic proteins, a detailed {{understanding of the}} metabolic dynamics during batch or fed-batch production is requested. To study the new human cell line AGE 1. HN, a flexible metabolic flux analysis method was developed that is considering dynamic changes in growth and metabolism during cultivation. This method comprises analysis of formation of cellular components as well as conversion of major substrates and products, spline fitting of dynamic data and flux estimation using metabolite balancing. During batch cultivation of AGE 1. HN three distinct phases were observed, an initial one with consumption of pyruvate and high glycolytic activity, a second characterized by a highly efficient metabolism with very little energy spilling waste production and <b>a</b> <b>third</b> with glutamine <b>limitation</b> and decreasing viability. Main events triggering changes in cellular metabolism were depletion of pyruvate and glutamine.

30|$|There were {{limitations}} to our study, though. The first limitation is that, {{because this was}} a two-centre study, CTC and preparation protocols were not uniform across participating centres. The performance characteristics found in our study are probably affected by these variable conditions. A second factor that probably had a negative influence on our results could be the lack of sufficient stool and fluid tagging and poor patient compliance that could make interpretation difficult in some cases. <b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> that could {{have an impact on the}} results could be the lack of simultaneous evaluation of supine and prone images for some of the readers and the use of difference workstations.

30|$|One {{limitation}} in {{this study}} is the sample convenience, another is the very small sample size, and <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> is the single country context. Brazil is the biggest country of South America and the fifth biggest of the world in land area, which includes one of the largest ethnic and cultural diversities of the world. In 2013, it was the ninth in population, with an estimated 200 million people and the seventh world economy, with GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of $ 2, 246 trillion World Bank (2015). According to the World Trade Organization (WTO) data it was the 21 st in export and the 20 th in import. It is part of the group of countries with emergent economy, known as BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India and China, including South Africa). Therefore, in spite of this limitation, Brazil is a representative country for the course of these types of studies.|$|E
30|$|<b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> {{applies to}} the {{industry}} categorization. Other separation methods to measure {{the effect of the}} industry can be used to research the EM-CSR relationship. Disclosure patterns differ from one industry type to another (Akhtaruddin, 2005). Further, the models do not consider all possibilities of all variables that can influence the relation between CSR and EM (cf. Jackson 2017). Therefore, future research may add other elements that can moderate the causal links between the variables. Other contingencies may be included in future studies as well. For instance, research has shown that firms with a higher proportion of non-executive directors appear to have lower earnings management (Klein, 2002). Also, the quality and extent of financial disclosure (Chen and Jaggi, 2000), disclosure frequency (Jo and Kim 2007), and other governance attributes, including board diversity and gender composition (Bear et al. 2010) may be addressed in research on the EM-CSR relationship.|$|E
5000|$|A {{limiting}} factor of a system, is a variable such {{that a small}} change in it from the present value would cause a non-negligible change in an output or other measure of the system. A factor which is not limiting over a certain domain of starting conditions may yet be limiting over another domain of starting conditions, including that of the factorThe identification of a factor as limiting is of use only in distinction {{to one or more}} other factors which is/are non-limiting. Disciplines differ in their use of the term as to whether they allow the simultaneous existence of more than one {{limiting factor}} (which may then be called [...] "co-limiting"), but they all require the existence of at least one non-limiting factor when the terms are used. There are several different possible scenarios of limitation when more than one factor is present. The first scenario called single limitation occurs when only one factor, the one with maximum demand, limits the system. Serial co-limitation is when one factor does not have any direct limiting effects on the system but needs to be present in order to increase the limitation of a second factor. <b>A</b> <b>third</b> scenario, independent <b>limitation,</b> occurs when two factors both have limiting effects on the system but they are working through different mechanisms. Another scenario, independent limitation, occurs when both factors contribute to the same mechanism of limitation but do so in different ways.|$|R
30|$|The <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> is that <b>a</b> {{relatively}} {{high number of}} patients had to be excluded {{because they did not}} have two successfully performed PET studies. Our failure rate was similar to the rate of 22 % for quantitative studies in the St Louis Study [3, 6], and lower than in another PET study that reported a failure rate of 41 % [28]. Finally, the sample size in our study was probably too small to detect differences between the two treatment strategies except when they were large.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> is that, if {{the class}} {{were to be}} {{extended}} (e.g., by making the constructor protected—this is risky but feasible), the subclass must provide its own re-implementation of all factory methods with exactly the same signatures. For example, if class [...] extends , then unless [...] provides {{its own version of}} all factory methods, the call StrangeComplex.FromPolar(1, Math.Pi); will yield an instance of [...] (the superclass) rather than the expected instance of the subclass. The reflection features of some languages can avoid this issue.|$|R
3000|$|... 1 Like {{any other}} study, {{this study is}} bound by certain {{limitations}} that also provide fertile grounds for further research. First, this study employed a convenience sample. Although it was a strong sample in terms of diversity, generalizations of the results must be made with caution. Therefore, future studies can use random sampling of general users. Second, {{this study did not}} consider cross-cultural issues; any comparative study from a developed or developing country would make a worthwhile contribution to this body of knowledge. <b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> of the current study is related to health websites. In this study, the definition of a health website is a little broad; therefore, the results may not be suitable for particular categories. Thus, future studies should examine the validity of the proposed model on a specific online service. In addition, the variables of this study have been measured at a single point in time; future studies should use a longitudinal analysis in order to validate the proposed model.|$|E
30|$|There {{are also}} {{limitations}} {{to the current}} work. First, there are multiple ways to construct a trimmed version of a larger scale. The approach applied here relied mainly on psychometric criteria. Alternatively, one could have given more weight to the representation of content captured by a RIASEC type or retain more gender-neutral items. Wille, De Fruyt, Dingemanse, and Vergauwe (2015), for example, recently proposed a facet structure within the RIASEC types, so that each facet in their model can be represented by one item in an abbreviated version. Likewise, gender-differences could be dampened probably by writing and selecting more gender-neutral items (for a more extended discussion on its feasibility see Fonteyne et al. 2016). A second limitation {{is the nature of}} the construction and validation samples, exclusively examining Brazilian adolescents and adults. Examining 18 REST’s validity in English-speaking samples of adolescents and adults (and also other languages) is one of the next steps to take. <b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> pertains to the empirical circular structure of the 18 REST, which was only modestly consistent with the presumed RIASEC order. The size of correlations found in this regard could reflect the small number of indicators and the fact maybe some of the resulting scales emphasize specific domain facets.|$|E
30|$|This {{study has}} several limitations, {{including}} {{a lack of}} validated outcomes with regards to patient and family contentment with the experience. Initial concerns about patient pain control and ability to transition to the home setting early in the postoperative period have been largely unfounded in our experience, and the AD pathway has been adopted across our entire hospital system since 2009. A second limitation {{may be that the}} retrospective nature of this study prevented our ability to capture all complications. Our hospital system provides the majority of scoliosis care to the state; however, it is possible that a patient may have gone to a more regionally accessible hospital to have a complication addressed. We assumed that early postoperative issues would have likely been relayed to the treating surgeon. Also, some wound-related complications may have been addressed by ancillary staff members without documentation in the hospital chart. <b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> was our inability to evaluate preoperative radiographs, as one of the practices did not keep films from this time period. We attempted to compensate for this lack of imaging by instead evaluating levels fused. Finally, while the AD and SD pathways were implemented by the surgeons at each campus, {{there is no way to}} ensure complete compliance, given the retrospective nature of this study.|$|E
50|$|Like {{all other}} types of signals, visual signals do have their downfalls and {{limitation}}s. The first limitation one can see is the range and reliability. Within this limitation, visual communication can become greatly disrupted during periods of poor visibility or when the terrain restricts clear observation. The second limitation one can see is misunderstanding. Many units do not follow specific Army doctrine (FM), but rather adopt their own SOP's. With thousands of different units, it is highly likely that unit SOP's will begin to overlap and cross each other. The <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> one can see is how vulnerable visual signals are to enemy interception; thus allowing the enemy to use our own signals for deception purposes.|$|R
30|$|One {{limitation}} in {{this study}} is that we only consider one retailer and one manufacturer in a two stage supply. Future research can be done for the situations including two or more competing supply chain members or in a multi-stage supply chain. The other limitation is that the parameters of the supply chain models are considered as triangular fuzzy numbers. In fact, the membership function of the fuzzy number can be nonlinear, one can consider the case the parameters are fuzzy random variables. The <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> is that the supply chain members are all assumed to be risk neutral. It is still interesting to discuss the problem how to design the contract policies when the supply chain members are risk averse or risk preference in a fuzzy environment.|$|R

30|$|<b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> of {{this study}} resides in the measures. We used a {{composite}} predictor variable to capture the overall set of motivational processes students experience in the garden as a whole, but this aggregate did {{not allow us to}} examine the structural relations among these processes or to distinguish whether specific aspects of garden experiences predict particular garden outcomes. For example, it may turn out that students’ sense of belonging is more important than their feelings of competence in the gardens or that enthusiastic engagement in SciLG is the key to improving student learning in science. Future studies can examine the individual or unique effects of these inter-related motivational processes separately to see if they are all essential ingredients or if some seem more important than others. Studies can also use structural models to test the proposed connections among these aspects of student experiences, as depicted in Fig.  2, examining, for example, whether students’ feelings of relatedness, competence, and autonomy in the gardens are each unique predictors of their engagement and re-engagement in garden-based activities. At the same time, however, {{it is important to note}} that the theoretical frameworks guiding this project, namely culturally responsive pedagogy and self-determination theory, suggest that programs will need to be concerned with supporting multiple student needs—for relatedness, competence, and autonomy—if they are going to counteract societal stereotypes and meet students' motivational and cultural needs.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{potential}} speed of an optical neural network {{that uses the}} longitudinal cavity modes of an external-cavity laser diode as neurons. For this purpose, we used a laser diode coupled to two external cavities, each corresponding to one longitudinal cavity mode. The process of longitudinal mode switching is investigated for the case of intracavity optical modulation. In this experiment, the feedback for the mode in one cavity is modulated, {{and the length of}} the other cavity can be controlled. Three limitations are imposed on the switching speed. A number of external-cavity round trips are needed to switch from one mode to the other. It is observed that, depending on the amount of optical feedback in both cavities, between 7 and 21 round trips are needed. When the experimental results for varying cavity length are extrapolated to zero cavity length, a residual delay of a few nanoseconds remains. It is believed that this delay is due to a change in carrier density, needed to switch from one mode to another. Modified rate equations are used to model our experiments. The results of numerical simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results and predict the residual delay. The model also predicts a turn-on delay that is related to relaxation oscillations and imposes <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> on the operation speed of our optical neural network. Implications of our findings on the potential operation speed of the optical neural network are discussed and suggestions are made for optimizatio...|$|E
30|$|Another {{limitation}} {{is the lack}} of CO-exposed subjects who did not undergo HBO therapy. It is not clear how both mitochondrial respiration and H 2 O 2 production would have changed without HBO treatment. For ethical reasons, HBO therapy was not withheld from any CO subject who met indications for HBO treatment. However, we note that repeat measures of mitochondrial function could be performed on patients who did not undergo HBO, as many patients with CO poisoning do not receive HBO [33]. <b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>limitation</b> of this study is the connection between the use of human blood cells as a marker of mitochondrial function in vital organs such as the brain and heart that are affected in CO poisoning. An animal model of hemorrhagic shock has been used to evaluate blood cells as a marker of organ mitochondrial function [34]. The advantage of using blood cells as a surrogate biomarker to assess organ mitochondrial function is very attractive for both clinical and research reasons. Blood cells are easily accessible with minimal risk via venipuncture, and samples can be obtained repeatedly to assess mitochondrial function over time and in response to treatment. Finally, another consideration is the novelty of simultaneous measurement of respiration and H 2 O 2 production. At this time, the current ROS that can be readily tested for is H 2 O 2 and superoxide to some extent. A {{limitation is}} that other ROS such as hydroxyl radical or other nitrogen-based species are not tested so it may give an incomplete picture involving ROS.|$|E
