5|$|Although the {{southern}} sea otter's range has continuously expanded from the remnant {{population of about}} 50 individuals in Big Sur since protection in 1911, however from 2007 to 2010, the otter population and its range contracted and since 2010 has made little progress. As of spring 2010, the northern boundary had moved from about Tunitas Creek to a point 2km southeast of Pigeon Point, and {{the southern}} boundary has moved from approximately Coal Oil Point to Gaviota State Park. Recently, a toxin called microcystin, produced by a type of cyanobacteria (Microcystis), seems to be concentrated in the shellfish the otters eat, poisoning them. Cyanobacteria are found in stagnant freshwater enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus from septic tank and agricultural fertilizer runoff, and may be flushed into the ocean when streamflows are high in the rainy season. <b>A</b> <b>record</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sea otter carcasses were found on California's coastline in 2010, with increased shark attacks an increasing component of the mortality.
