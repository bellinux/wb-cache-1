5|$|Betances {{was awarded}} the rank of Chévalier (Knight) of the Legion of Honor by the French {{government}} in July 1887, for {{his work as a}} diplomat for the Dominican Republic, and for his work as a medical doctor in France. He had been offered the award as early as 1882, but had repeatedly declined the honor out of humility, until friends from Puerto Rico persuaded him to accept it as a tribute to Puerto Rico, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> personal award. The French Legion of Honor (Légion d'honneur) is the premier order of France, and its award is one of great distinction.|$|E
5|$|Filipinos awarded {{with the}} rank or title National Artist of the Philippines are not {{considered}} to be national symbols because the title is given in recognition to the recipient's contributions to Philippine arts and letters <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbol that represents traditions and ideals and convey the principles of sovereignty and national solidarity.|$|E
5|$|In {{military}} affairs, {{the use of}} infantry with specialised roles increased. Along {{with the}} still-dominant heavy cavalry, armies often included mounted and infantry crossbowmen, as well as sappers and engineers. Crossbows, which had been known in Late Antiquity, increased in use {{partly because of the}} increase in siege warfare in the 10th and 11th centuries. The increasing use of crossbows during the 12th and 13th centuries led to the use of closed-face helmets, heavy body armour, as well as horse armour. Gunpowder was known in Europe by the mid-13th century with a recorded use in European warfare by the English against the Scots in 1304, although it was merely used as an explosive <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> weapon. Cannon were being used for sieges in the 1320s, and hand-held guns were in use by the 1360s.|$|E

5|$|It {{would take}} FDR another five years, {{with the help}} of the League of Women Voters to replace Stevens. Making the {{argument}} that Stevens was appointed by the Conference of the Pan-American States <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> U.S. delegate, FDR agreed to give permanent status to the CIM, if each state was allowed to appoint their own delegates. Securing approval, he then immediately replaced Stevens with Mary Nelson Winslow. Stevens did not go quietly and the clash continued throughout 1939 with Eleanor Roosevelt backing Winslow and suffragists backing Stevens. Eleanor's objection to Stevens was multi-faced, in that she did not think that the Equal Rights Amendment would protect women and on a personal level, she believed Stevens behaved in an unladylike manner.|$|E
5|$|San Martín {{proposed}} that the country declare independence immediately, before the crossing. That way, they would be acting as a sovereign nation, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mere rebellion. He had great influence over the Congress of Tucumán, a Congress with deputies from the provinces, which was established in March 1816. He opposed the appointment of José Moldes, a soldier from Salta who was against the policies of Buenos Aires, as he feared Moldes would break national unity. He rejected proposals to be appointed Supreme Director himself. He supported his friend and lodge member Juan Martín de Pueyrredón for the office. Pueyrredón resumed the military aid to Cuyo. The Congress of Tucumán declared independence on 9 July 1816. Congress discussed the type of government of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (modern Argentina). General Manuel Belgrano, who had made a diplomatic mission to Europe, informed them that independence would be more easily acknowledged by the European powers if the country established a monarchy. For this purpose, Belgrano proposed a plan to crown a noble of the Inca Empire as king (the Sapa Inca dynasty had been dethroned in the 16th century). San Martín supported this proposal, as well as Güemes and most deputies, except for those from Buenos Aires, who undermined the project and prevented its approval.|$|E
5|$|The Curiate Assembly (comitia curiata) was the {{principal}} assembly {{during the first two}} decades of the Roman Republic. The Curiate Assembly was organized as an Assembly, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Council even though only patricians were members. During these first decades, the People of Rome were organized into thirty units called Curiae. The Curiae were ethnic in nature, and thus were organized {{on the basis of the}} early Roman family, or, more specifically, on the basis of the thirty original Patrician (aristocratic) clans. The Curiae assembled into the Curiate Assembly, for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. The Curiate Assembly passed laws, elected Consuls (the only elected magistrates at the time), and tried judicial cases. Consuls always presided over the assembly.|$|E

5|$|The Tribal Assembly (comitia populi tributa) of the Roman Republic was the {{democratic}} assembly of Roman citizens. The Tribal Assembly was organized as an Assembly, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Council. During {{the years of}} the Roman Republic, citizens were organized on the basis of thirty-five Tribes which included patricians and plebeians. The Tribes gathered into the Tribal Assembly for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. The president of the Tribal Assembly was usually either a Consul (the highest ranking Roman Magistrate) or a Praetor (the second-highest ranking Roman Magistrate). The Tribal Assembly elected three different magistrates: Quaestors, Curule Aediles, and Military Tribunes. The Tribal Assembly also had the power to try judicial cases.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{government}} {{agreed to}} pay compensation for the damaged property {{but not for the}} actual victims of the massacre, although Bayard was inclined to resist the requests for payments. In a letter to the minister of China's Washington legation dated February 18, 1886, he expressed a personal view that the violence against Chinese immigrants was precipitated by their resistance to cultural assimilation, and that racism against Chinese was typically found among other immigrants rather than the majority of the populace: Denby's predictions caused Bayard to seek a Congressionally appropriated indemnity. At Bayard's urging, the U.S. Congress provided US$147,748.74 as an indemnity. The compensation was made as a monetary gift <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> legal decree of responsibility for the massacre and the outcome amounted to a minor diplomatic victory for China.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{initiating}} the war, Argentina had not prepared {{a plan for}} the subsequent defence of the islands. The military dictatorship that governed the country at the time regarded the seizure of the Falklands <b>as</b> <b>a</b> political act to obtain a diplomatic bargaining position, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> act of war. Consequently they were taken by surprise when the British responded with a large-scale mobilization, and a task force to retake the islands.|$|R

In such problems, any unnecessary detail is usually omitted, {{and this is the}} reason why the characters in the story have no distinctive characteristics. Also, the description of the case eliminates the possibility to obtain circumstantial evidence, thereby forcing the recipient to confront the dilemma directly and not seek for indirect ways to solve it.|$|E

25|$|Bellarmine {{found no}} problem with heliocentrism {{so long as it}} was treated as a purely {{hypothetical}} calculating device <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> physically real phenomenon, but he did not regard it as permissible to advocate the latter unless it could be conclusively proved through current scientific standards.
