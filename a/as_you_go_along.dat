We rewrote most of the dialogue, all of us, which was also unusual, and Mr. Welles always wanted our input. It was a {{collective}} effort, and {{there was such a}} surge of participation, of creativity, of energy. You could feel the pulse growing as we rehearsed.You felt you were inventing something <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>along.</b> Mr. Welles wanted to seize every moment. He didn't want one bland moment. He made you feel you were involved in a wonderful event that was happening before your eyes.|$|R

5000|$|His {{first novel}} Windyridge was written {{as a series}} of weekly chapters, in the winter of early 1911, to {{entertain}} his wife and two friends, the Bolton sisters, whose parents and third sister had all recently died. He quotes himself as saying [...] "I tell you what I'll do, I'll write a story and read each chapter to <b>you</b> <b>as</b> I <b>go</b> <b>along,</b> week by week. It may help to keep us from brooding". The story is set in the village of Hawksworth near Baildon. He completed the tale in early 1912, having paused in his writing over the summer, and was persuaded to submit it for publication. He agreed to send it to just one publishing house, and chose this by writing on slips of paper the names of three established houses and the novice publisher Herbert Jenkins. It was this last slip which he selected, and Jenkins agreed to publish the book, as his firm's first publication.|$|R
6000|$|I like that. We {{have not}} {{all had the}} good fortune to be ladies. We have not all been generals, or poets, or statesmen; but when the toast works down to the babies, we stand on common ground. It is a shame that for a {{thousand}} years the world's banquets have utterly ignored the baby, as if he didn't amount to anything. If you will stop and think a minute--if <b>you</b> will <b>go</b> back fifty or one hundred years to your early married life and recontemplate your first baby--you will remember that he amounted to a great deal, and even something over. You soldiers all know that when the little fellow arrived at family headquarters you had to hand in your resignation. He took entire command. You became his lackey, his mere body-servant, and you had to stand around, too. He was not a commander who made allowances for time, distance, weather, or anything else. You had to execute his order whether it was possible or not. And there was only one form of marching in his manual of tactics, and that was the double-quick. He treated you with every sort of insolence and disrespect, and the bravest of you didn't dare to say a word. You could face the death-storm at Donelson and Vicksburg, and give back blow for blow; but when he clawed your whiskers, and pulled your hair, and twisted your nose, you had to take it. When the thunders of war were sounding in your ears you set your faces toward the batteries, and advanced with steady tread; but when he turned on the terrors of his war-whoop you advanced in the other direction, and mighty glad of the chance, too. When he called for soothing-syrup, did you venture to throw out any side remarks about certain services being unbecoming an officer and a gentleman? No. You got up and got it. When he ordered his pap-bottle and it was not warm, did you talk back? Not <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>went</b> to work and warmed it. You even descended so far in your menial office as to take a suck at that warm, insipid stuff yourself, to see if it was right--three parts water to one of milk, a touch of sugar to modify the colic, and a drop of peppermint to kill those hiccoughs. I can taste that stuff yet. And how many things <b>you</b> learned <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>along!</b> Sentimental young folks still take stock in that beautiful old saying that when the baby smiles in his sleep, it is because the angels are whispering to him. Very pretty, but too thin--simply wind on the stomach, my friends. If the baby proposed to take a walk at his usual hour, two o'clock in the morning, didn't you rise up promptly and remark, with a mental addition which would not improve a Sunday-school book much, that that was the very thing you were about to propose yourself? Oh! you were under good discipline, and <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> fluttering up and down the room in your undress uniform, you not only prattled undignified baby-talk, but even tuned up your martial voices and tried to sing!--"Rock-a-by baby in the treetop," [...] for instance. What a spectacle for an Army of the Tennessee! And what an affliction for the neighbors, too; for it is not everybody within a mile around that likes military music at three in the morning. And when you had been keeping this sort of thing up two or three hours, and your little velvet-head intimated that nothing suited him like exercise and noise, what did you do? ["Go on!"] <b>You</b> simply <b>went</b> on until <b>you</b> dropped in the last ditch. The idea that a baby doesn't amount to anything! Why, one baby is just a house and a front yard full by itself. One baby can furnish more business than you and your whole Interior Department can attend to. He is enterprising, irrepressible, brimful of lawless activities. Do what you please, you can't make him stay on the reservation. Sufficient unto the day is one baby. As long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are in your right mind don't you ever pray for twins. Twins amount to a permanent riot. And there ain't any real difference between triplets and an insurrection.|$|R
6000|$|These {{people here}} {{live in the}} heaviest, highest, broadest, darkest, solidest houses one can imagine. Each one might [...] "laugh a siege to scorn." [...] A hundred feet front and a hundred high is about the style, and <b>you</b> <b>go</b> up three flights of stairs before you begin to come upon signs of occupancy. Everything is stone, and stone of the heaviest--floors, stairways, mantels, benches--everything. The walls are four to five feet thick. The streets {{generally}} are four or five to eight feet wide and as crooked <b>as</b> a corkscrew. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> one of these gloomy cracks, and look up and behold the sky like a mere ribbon of light, far above your head, where {{the tops of the}} tall houses {{on either side of the}} street bend almost together. <b>You</b> feel <b>as</b> if <b>you</b> were at the bottom of some tremendous abyss, with all the world far above you. You wind in and out and here and there, in the most mysterious way, and have no more idea of the points of the compass than if you were a blind man. You can never persuade yourself that these are actually streets, and the frowning, dingy, monstrous houses dwellings, till you see one of these beautiful, prettily dressed women emerge from them--see her emerge from a dark, dreary-looking den that looks dungeon all over, from the ground away halfway up to heaven. And then you wonder that such a charming moth could come from such a forbidding shell as that. The streets are wisely made narrow and the houses heavy and thick and stony, in order that the people may be cool in this roasting climate. And they are cool, and stay so. And while I think of it--the men wear hats and have very dark complexions, but the women wear no headgear but a flimsy veil like a gossamer's web, and yet are exceedingly fair as a general thing. Singular, isn't it? ...|$|R

And to think you make it up yourself <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>along!</b> I suppose your grandfather would never hear to your studying music--would he now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you {{had better}} take a good stock of powder and ball, and you can {{practise}} a bit <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>along.</b> A man ain't any use out on these plains if he cannot shoot. I have got a pony; but you must buy one, and a saddle, and fixings. We will buy another between us to carry our swag. But you need not trouble about the things, I will get all that fixed." ...|$|E

If she broaches to, it is all up with us. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> tell each man to shift himself a bit more aft. Her stern must be well down or I can never keep her straight. If you can’t fix the floor-board, get up the mast; tie up the {{foresail}} in a roll, and then hoist it, that will give hold enough to the wind.” ...|$|E

[...] "Now, gentlemen, you are at liberty to go, and I wish you a {{pleasant}} walk home. It is only about a hundred miles. Your friends with the cattle shall join you at once.

6000|$|... "Well, my boy," [...] exclaimed Millthorpe to Pierre; [...] "you {{are in the}} Inferno dream yet. Look; that's {{what people}} call an easel, my boy. An easel, an easel--not a weasel; {{you look at it}} as though you thought it a weasel. Come; wake up, wake up! You ordered it, I suppose, and here it is. Going to paint and {{illustrate}} the Inferno, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>along,</b> I suppose. Well, my friends tell me it is a great pity my own things aint illustrated. But I can't afford it. There now is that Hymn to the Niger, which I threw into a pigeon-hole, a year or two ago--that would be fine for illustrations." ...|$|E

I simply say that these facts, stated together, are singular, and I think they give you a clue. How that clue is to be followed up, I cannot at present suggest, I simply affirm that it is a clue. Now I want you to take the next train to Chicago. A client of mine wants some enquiries made about a house which he is thinking of purchasing. Here are the papers connected with it; you can study them <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>along.</b> Of course you will go to the land office and see if there are any mortgages on it, and you will look up the titles." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} paper analyses {{the sustainability}} of the Peruvian “Pay <b>as</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> System” which {{is provided by the}} Government. In Peru, the “Pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>Go</b> System” coexists with Private Pension Funds or “Fully Funded Pension”. Sometimes both systems compete with each other with advantages and disadvantages between them. We found that “Pay <b>as</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> System” cannot be sustainable {{over a long period of}} time. In addition, based on a comparative analysis of advantages and disadvantages, we propose some recommendations to make Private Pension Funds (Fully Funded Pension) the best alternative to Pay <b>as</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> System...|$|R

60|$|July 3d, 4th, 5th.--Clear, hot, {{favorable}} weather--has {{been a good}} summer--the {{growth of}} clover and grass now generally mow'd. The familiar delicious perfume fills the barns and lanes. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> you see the fields of grayish white slightly tinged with yellow, the loosely stack'd grain, the slow-moving wagons passing, and farmers in the fields with stout boys pitching and loading the sheaves. The corn is about beginning to tassel. All over the middle and southern states the spear-shaped battalia, multitudinous, curving, flaunting--long, glossy, dark-green plumes for the great horseman, earth. I hear the cheery notes of my old acquaintance Tommy quail; but {{too late for the}} whip-poor-will, (though I heard one solitary lingerer night before last.) I watch the broad majestic flight of a turkey-buzzard, sometimes high up, sometimes low enough to see the lines of his form, even his spread quills, in relief against the sky.
