5|$|A Love Surreal {{comprises}} <b>a</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> slow-burning {{songs about}} {{different stages of}} love, including infatuation, seduction, romance, estrangement, longing, renewal, and existential peace.

In contrast to Airtight's Revenge, A Love Surreal deals more with feelings of lust and flirting rather than personal and societal issues.|$|E

The production of these busts can be traced, in general, to a contemporary reworking of ancient portraiture. In the oldest busts, i.e., those facing the piazza, there are similarities with the image of Bartolomeo Colleoni in the memorial by Andrea del Verrochio in Venice, with an evoking of an effigy of Antoninus Pius and a portrait of Nero, all famous images at the time and here revived in three dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Recordings of Bach's cantatas {{began in}} the first half of the 20th century. Series of {{recording}}s, often for broadcasting, were made from 1950. Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Gustav Leonhardt were the first to begin recording the complete cantatas in a 20-year collaboration using period instruments, boys' choirs and boy soloists. Helmuth Rilling completed a recording of the sacred cantatas and oratorios on Bach's 300th birthday, 21 March 1985. Other projects to record all sacred cantatas in historically informed performance were completed by Ton Koopman, John Eliot Gardiner, Pieter Jan Leusink and Masaaki Suzuki. Sigiswald Kuijken began to record <b>a</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> cantatas for the Complete Liturgical Year with an OVPP choir and historic instruments, the ensemble La Petite Bande.|$|E
5|$|Single-sensed souls, however, called nigoda, and element-bodied souls pervade all {{tiers of}} this universe. Nigodas are souls {{at the bottom}} end of the existential hierarchy.

According to Jain texts, this infinity of nigodas {{can also be found}} in plant tissues, root vegetables and animal bodies. Depending on its karma, a soul transmigrates and reincarnates within the scope of this cosmology of destinies. The four main destinies are further divided into sub-categories and still smaller sub–sub categories. In all, Jain texts speak of <b>a</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> 8.4 million birth destinies in which souls find themselves again and again as they cycle within samsara.|$|E

5|$|Substance Dualism is {{a common}} feature of several {{orthodox}} Hindu schools including the Sāṅkhya, Nyāya, Yoga and Dvaita Vedanta. In these schools a clear difference is drawn between matter and a non-material soul, which is eternal and undergoes samsara, <b>a</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> death and rebirth. The Nyāya school argued that qualities such as cognition and desire are inherent qualities which are not possessed by anything solely material, and therefore by process of elimination must belong to a non-material self, the atman. Many of these schools see their spiritual goal as moksha, liberation from the cycle of reincarnation.|$|E

The Harper's Song, the lyrics found on a tombstone of the Middle Kingdom and on Papyrus Harris 500 from the New Kingdom, was to be performed for dinner guests at formal banquets.|$|E
