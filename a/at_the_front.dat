5|$|The premaxillary bones {{each house}} a single incisor, {{which is located}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> tip. They end in a V shape <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> margin and in a narrow point at the back margin. Inside each premaxilla is a large opening, the {{anterior}} palatal foramen. The maxillary bone contains the other upper teeth. The mandible ranges from thin to robust and houses the lower teeth.|$|E
25|$|The second {{mechanism}} {{is a force}} imbalance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> calving <b>front</b> due to thinning causing a substantial non-linear response. In this case an imbalance of forces <b>at</b> <b>the</b> calving <b>front</b> propagates up-glacier. Thinning causes the glacier to be more buoyant, reducing frictional back forces, as the glacier becomes more afloat <b>at</b> <b>the</b> calving <b>front.</b> <b>The</b> reduced friction due to greater buoyancy allows {{for an increase in}} velocity. This is akin to letting off the emergency brake a bit. The reduced resistive force <b>at</b> <b>the</b> calving <b>front</b> is then propagated up-glacier via longitudinal extension because of the backforce reduction. For ice streaming sections of large outlet glaciers (in Antarctica as well) there is always water <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base of the glacier that helps lubricate the flow.|$|R

40|$|This is a {{study on}} the {{importance}} of including sustainability <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>front</b> end (FFE) stage in new product development process. Sustainable design is a design philosophy that seeks to minimize or eliminate negative impact to the natural environment through skillful and sensitive design. The importance of including sustainability <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>front</b> end includes but is not limited to early tackling of barriers, enabling doing the right things versus doing things right and providing a platform to tackle sustainability problems at a higher system level. This study also analyzed tools for implementing sustainability <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>front</b> end. They include, decision matrix, Eco compass, strategy list, cost analysis, creativity techniques, rules of thumb, expert rules etc. A survey was carried out to understand how organizations’ perceive sustainability; if these organizations include sustainability in their new product development process and most importantly if this implementation is done <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>front</b> end. <b>The</b> survey results suggests that organizations are {{aware of the importance of}} including sustainability in the new product development process; however, implementing sustainability <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>front</b> end is moderate. A framework was developed based on the literature review and survey to implement sustainability <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>front</b> end...|$|R

5|$|Although m1 {{is nearly}} rectangular, the width <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> is still {{smaller than the}} width at the back. There is a strong anteroconid. A crest, the metalophid, reaches from the protoconid nearly to the metaconid. A small cusp, the mesostylid, is {{connected}} to the metaconid in front of it, unlike in Miopetaurista and Aliveria. There are two broad roots. The next tooth, m2, is similar to m1 in most respects, but the width <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> is virtually equal to the width at the back, so that the tooth is about rectangular. The back of m3 is rounded, but the tooth is still nearly rectangular. There is a long anteroconid, with is mainly connected to the metaconid. There is no metalophid. This tooth has three roots: two <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and a larger one at the back.|$|E

5|$|M1 is flat-crowned. The anteroloph, a crest <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the tooth, lacks {{a smaller}} {{accessory}} spur that {{is present in}} N.rufus. The paracone, {{one of the main}} cusps, is quite small; this cusp is more prominent in N.rufus. The mesoloph, a crest on the middle of the tooth, is distinct but short and located further to the back than in N.rufus. M2 has a longer mesoloph. M3 is largely flat-crowned, but the paracone is a bit more prominent than the rest. The valley between the cusps <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> is deeper than the valleys at the back. Each of the upper molars has three roots.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} lower molar, the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are {{separated}} by an anteromedian fossette. The second lower molar bears a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps, the protoconid and metaconid, that form {{the front edge of}} the molar in some other oryzomyines. There is a distinct ridge (anterolabial cingulum) at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The third lower molar also bears an anterolophid and an anterolabial cingulum. The first lower molar has large roots <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and back of the tooth and two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two large roots, one <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and one at the back.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{mechanism}} is a [...] "Jakobshavn effect", coined by Terry Hughes, {{where a small}} imbalance of forces caused by some perturbation can cause a substantial non-linear response. In this case an imbalance of forces <b>at</b> <b>the</b> calving <b>front</b> propagates up-glacier. Thinning causes the glacier to be more buoyant, even becoming afloat <b>at</b> <b>the</b> calving <b>front,</b> and is responsive to tidal changes. The reduced friction due to greater buoyancy allows {{for an increase in}} velocity. The reduced resistive force <b>at</b> <b>the</b> calving <b>front</b> is then propagated up glacier via longitudinal extension in what R. Thomas calls a backforce reduction.|$|R

5|$|The anteroconid—the cusp <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of m1—is usually {{divided in}} two by a central {{indentation}} (the anteromedian fossettid) in A.donovani, but this fossettid is absent in A.praeuniversitatis. Behind the anteroconid is the protoconid—metaconid pair of cusps. There is an anterolabial cingulum—a crest <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> labial margin, {{in front of}} the protoconid. There is a long crest behind the metaconid, a mesolophid. There is usually no corresponding crest (an ectolophid) behind the protoconid. Another pair of cusps—the hypoconid and the entoconid—is located {{at the back of the}} tooth. The entoconid, the lingual cusp of the two, is oriented forwards. There is always a large root <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the tooth and another at the back. A.donovani usually has a small labial root between the two large roots and often also another small root at the lingual side, but only one of four A.praeuniversitatis m1s even has the labial rootlet.|$|E

5|$|The anterolabial {{cingulum}} and anteroconid {{are both}} absent on m3. The mesolophid is usually absent. As in m2, {{there are two}} roots <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> in A.donovani and only one in A.praeuniversitatis, but the front roots are usually fused in A.donovani.|$|E
5|$|The cusp <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of M1, the anterocone, is {{separated}} into two smaller cusps by an indentation. In A.donovani, a ridge generally connects the two cusps <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{margin of the}} tooth, so that the indentation separating them is closed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> (an anteromedian fossette), but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is open toward the front (an anteromedian flexus). An additional crest, the anteroloph, is present behind the anterocone. Further to the back, there {{is a pair of}} cusps—the protocone at the lingual, or inner, side and the paracone at the labial, or outer, side. A crest issues from the paracone and is attached to the front or middle part of the protocone. Behind the paracone, the mesoloph crest is present; an additional crest usually connects the two. At the back of the tooth, there are two additional large cusps—the hypocone (lingual) and metacone (labial)—and a prominent crest, the posteroloph, issues from the hypocone and is located behind the metacone. In A.donovani, the metacone is generally connected to the posteroloph, but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is directly connected to the hypocone. The valleys that separate the cusps extend from the lingual and labial margins to about the midline of the molar. In addition to a large root <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and two large roots at the back (one labial, one lingual) there is a small additional labial root.|$|E
5|$|The first lower molar is rounded <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{end and the}} labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, {{are barely}} distinct. The second lower molar is {{elongated}} and has a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps that form {{the front edge of}} the molar in some other oryzomyines, the protoconid and metaconid. A distinct ridge (anterolabial cingulum) is at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The lower third molar is about as long as the second and also has an anterolophid, albeit a less well-defined one. The first lower molar has large roots <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and back of the tooth and usually one or two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have either two roots, one labial and one lingual, or only one <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> and another large root at the back.|$|E
