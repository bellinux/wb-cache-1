5|$|The Grand Prix was contested by eleven {{teams with}} two drivers each. The teams (also known as constructors) were McLaren, Ferrari, Jordan, Jaguar, Williams, Benetton, Prost, Sauber, Arrows, Minardi and BAR. Tyre {{supplier}} Bridgestone brought two different tyre compounds to the race; the Soft and the Medium dry compound tyres. The A1-Ring underwent minor safety {{changes in the}} run-up to the race. The modifications were new kerbs placed across the track with flagstones inside the kerbs to prevent dust from accumulating on the circuit. An additional row of tyres were erected at <b>all</b> <b>corners</b> and were designed to increase absorption in the event of a collision.|$|E

5|$|Industry {{is heavy}} along the bay, with an {{abundance}} of natural gas and oil wells at <b>all</b> <b>corners.</b> Natural gas was discovered at the site in 1934, and oil was discovered the next year. Point Comfort is home to several industrial plants along the shore, including Alcoa, Union Carbide, Du Pont, and Formosa Plastics Corp, which contribute to the local economies. Despite the restrictions on the bay that prevent the production of fish and shellfish along the superfund site, seafood harvesting is a major industry. However, it is not as prominent {{as it was in the}} 1920s, when Port Lavaca led the nation in shrimp production, leading to the construction of a quick-freezing plant. Today, shrimping is only allowed south of the Port Lavaca Causeway, due to the north's classification as a nursery location. Shellfish production is allowed in Keller Bay and Lavaca Bay south of Point Comfort, but is restricted along the eastern and northern coast and Chocolate Bay, and is conditionally approved in the remaining locations, including along the shore of Port Lavaca. A small tourism industry also fuels economic growth, spurred by the Port Lavaca State Fishing Pier found alongside the Port Lavaca Causeway. The pier once served as the causeway across the bay but was replaced in the 1960s and converted into a fishing pier of , billed as the longest in the world.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCompared with a {{straight}} blade, a unique compressor blade integrated forward-swept and positive curved stacking line is studied experimentally. Aerodynamic parameters of the two cascades are measured by a five hole probe at different positions and ink trace flow visualization is conducted on blade surfaces. The result shows that the swept curved cascade has lower endw all loss and higher midspan loss {{as compared with the}} straight cascade. However, lower loss is accompanied with lower diffusion factor. Opposite' C' shape static pressure distribution is established on the suction surface of the swept curved blade, which is helpful for avoiding the accumulation of low energy fluid in the endw <b>all</b> <b>corner</b> region. Anyhow the studies support the conclusion that the swept-curved blade conduces to not only the reduction of overall loss but also the improvement of stable operation in the endw <b>all</b> <b>corner</b> region...|$|R
