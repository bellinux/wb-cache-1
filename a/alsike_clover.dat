40|$|The key {{to pasture}} {{improvement}} in the tussock country of the South Island is in the introduction of high-producing legumes. White, red and <b>alsike</b> <b>clovers</b> {{have been widely used}} with considerable success. Lucerne, as yet, is much less important, even though it has been shown by Iversen (1965) that on droughty soils it can produce much more dry matter than conventional pastures. One of the main reasons for the lesser use of lucerne is the difficulty in establishing the plant by surface sowing methods, particularly in acid soils. Lucerne is particularly sensitive to acid soil conditions which affect establishment and growth in several ways. There are two possible approaches to overcoming problems of establishing lucerne on acid soils. The usual method is to modify the soil environment to suit the plant, by heavy broadcast liming. This is often uneconomic in tussock country owing to high transport costs. Another approach is to select strains of R. meliloti and species of lucerne which are more tolerant of acid soils. The latter approach has distinct possibilities, but, at present, it is a relatively new field. At Lincoln College an attempt is being made to combine both approaches in overcoming establishment problems in the tussock country...|$|R
40|$|Legumes are {{important}} in world agriculture, providing biologically fixed nitrogen, breaking cereal disease cycles and contributing locally grown food and feed, including forage. Pea and faba bean were grown by early farmers in Finland, with remains dated to 500 BC. Landraces of pea and faba bean were gradually replaced by better adapted, higher quality materials for food use. While grain legumes have been restricted by their long growing seasons {{to the south of}} the country, red, white and <b>alsike</b> <b>clovers</b> are native throughout and have long been used in leys for grazing, hay and silage. Breeding programmes released many cultivars of these crops during the 1900 s, particularly pea and red clover. A. I. Virtanen earned the 1945 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on both nitrogen fixation and silage preservation. Use of crop mixtures may appear modern, but farmers used them already in the early 1800 s, when oat was used to support pea, and much effort has been devoted to improving the system and establishing its other benefits. Although international cultivars have been easily accessible since Finland’s 1995 entry into the European Union, the combination of feed quality and appropriate earliness is still needed, as < 1 % of arable land is sown to grain legumes and an increase to 9 – 10 % would allow replacement of imported protein feeds. Climate change will alter the stresses on legume crops, and investment in agronomy, physiology and breeding is needed so that farmers can gain from the many advantages of a legume-supported rotation...|$|R

INTRQDUCTlON THE L INCOLN COLLEGE hill country property of “Hunua ” is typical of large areas of dry hill country in North Canterbury, and in Marlborough and North Otago. The mean annual rainfall is 660 mm but is highly variable and in the 12 years of records has ranged f rom 432 to 9 1 5 mm. Droughts a re normal in summer but may extend into spring or autumn, while winters are cool and frosty. The climate is dominated by strong prevailing north-west winds which produce marked contrasts between sunny and shady aspects. On sunny aspects active plant growth is re-stricted to spring and autumn, while on shady faces pasture growth continues further into summer. There is generally little problem in improving shady aspects. Initial experiments (White et al., 1972) showed that white clover (Trifolium repens) is easily established and maintained by ro-tational grazing, while grasses such as Ruanui ryegrass (Lolium perenne) can be established after 3 years of clover, when the soil fertility has been raised. On sunny slopes, however, perennial clovers do not appear to survive a severe summer drought except in damper ‘sites or in the shelter of tussock or matagouri.

Expenditures for the year were 255. 00 for office quarters, heat and light, 89. 60 finance committee expense, and 1824. 14 for conducting the general program. The program of work directed special emphasis to F-F-L, Beef Cattle, 4 -H and Project club work. Test plats of sorghum varieties showed Leoti as superior to other varieties with a green weight yield of 9. 5 tons. This compares with 8 tons for black amber, 7. 2 tons for early sumac with other varieties scaling considerably lower. Grain sorghums were again unsuccessful because of early freezing weather. Results obtained by the Valentine Experiment station do not show enough superiority of hybrid corn over local varieties to justify the added expense. One good stand of Hardistan alfalfa has survived dry weather and is a profitable seed crop. Experimental seedings of strawberry clover in alkali spots; red top, timothy, red and <b>alsike</b> <b>clovers,</b> reed canary grass in wet meadows; and crested wheat grass for dry abandoned cropland areas are being conducted. Greater success with the vegetable garden has been reported by 150 farm and ranch homes due to this year 2 ̆ 7 s Extension program. Timely help for all gardeners in the county has been given. Yard beautification improvements were made in not less than 400 yards at the homes of Cherry County ranchers, farmers, and townspeople, {{as a result of the}} attention given to this phase of the Extension program during 1940. Records were made of some of these improvements. 89 homes followed recommendations for planting shrubs and trees. 98 homes planted new lawns or improved existing lawns according to recommendations made. 69 homes corrected walks, drives, and fences to improve the appearance of their home yards. 80 new yard fences were constructed. 50 yard fences were changed. 88 unsightly views were screened with hedges or constructed screens. 286 homes reported a general clean-up on their yards. These records were obtained as a part of the yard beautification demonstration for project clubs. In addition it is known that many other improvements were made of which no records were taken. 52 cooperators planted 23, 700 Clarke-McNary seedlings to form windbreaks. 113 farmers planted trees as a part of their compliance with the Agricultural Conservation cropland program on 335 acres of windbreak. 81 homemakers reported planting trees for erosion control as a part of the home demonstration program for women 2 ̆ 7 s project clubs. 75 homes in the town of Valentine cooperated with a plan developed by the Junior Chamber of Commerce to stimulate interest in tree planting. There is some duplication in these reports obtained through the above mentioned sources. It is conservatively estimated that 265 different plantings of trees were made during 1940. This number compares with 140 for 1939 when estimated on the same basis. 108 homes were repaired. Major repairs were made in 8 homes; 1 water system was installed; 2 light plants placed; 2 poultry houses constructed; 1 complete new barn constructed; built-in kitchen cabinets were installed in 2 homes; 1 house was remodeled; copies were made of a feature of 40 hay equipment machines; 21 chicken feeders and mail boxes were completed as 4 -H projects. 4 meadows were drained; 1 meadow and 5 garden irrigation systems were installed. These reports of accomplishments are listed as those definitely assisted by the Extension program during 1940. Help with poultry rations was extended to 68 turkey growers and a few chicken growers. Regular monthly turkey bulletins prepared at the state office in Lincoln were forwarded by this office to the turkey growers in the county. 38 farm security clients were given assistance to increase production and improve the quality of milk and cream. The county fair, a spring and fall show sponsored by the Northwest Hereford Breeders 2 ̆ 7 Association, a district calf show at Mullen serving the south part of Cherry County, were exhibits for competitive quality improvement. These were the methods employed to bring to the attention of ranchers in the county the possibilities for beef cattle herd improvement. Nearly every rancher in the county was given information concerning control of Bang 2 ̆ 7 s Disease, hemorrhagic, and such specific troubles as calf diptheria, foul foot, retention of urine, grass tetany, white scours, and blackleg. Office interviews, discussion meetings, and circular mailings were the methods used. Assistance to the Sandhills Feeder Cattle Producers 2 ̆ 7 Association and other livestock organizations in the county was given both by the state office and the county Extension office. With over 42, 000 head of feeder cattle, and the offerings of purebred breeders, it is estimated that the total value of livestock sold by individuals participating in these organizations is in excess of 3, 500, 000. 00 for 1940. Rations and feeding practices came under discussion in office interviews, at meetings, and at farm and ranch visits. Soybean cake vs. cottonseed cake as a source of protein was given particular attention. Our recommendations were that soybean cake should be fed in preference to cottonseed cake when the latter is 4. 00 or more per ton higher in price than the former. When soybean cake is fed, phosphorus mineral should be offered ad lib. Sheep feed requirements for wintering, care of the ewe at lambing time, stomach worm control, and wool marketing information was given to 90 sheep growers in the county. 77 farmers and ranchers cooperated in the 1940 Pasture-Forage-Livestock program. Each contributed an outline of his methods. This program was conducted as a research or study of management methods as found on the ranches when visited. 243 weekly news stories concerning the Extension program in Cherry County were submitted to all or a part of 5 newspapers published in the county, and 6 published at stations outside the county borders. 55 circular letters announcing events or discussing subject matter were mailed. 1926 personal letters were written from the county office. 409 ladies enrolled in 31 project clubs for the year 1939 - 1940. Training centers for leaders were conducted at Valentine, Merriman, Gordon, Hyannis, Mullen, and Thedford. 15 clubs were represented at the Valentine Center, 7 at Merriman, 4 at Gordon, 3 at Hyannis, and 3 at Mullen. At Thedford, members from Cherry County enrolled in Thomas County clubs. The demonstrations given this year were Read for Facts and Sing for Fun, Company Dinners, Merry Christmas for the Home, Table Service, Care and Repair of Walls and Floors, and The Livable Home. 21 4 -H clubs were organized. 104 boys and 70 girls enrolled for 196 projects. In addition 29 associate members enrolled for as many projects. Of these associate members enrolled 13 were boys and 16 were girls. 62 boys and 39 girls finished their projects as achievement members. In addition 13 associate members earned achievement certificates. The county Extension office was given charge of the 4 -H, handicraft, floral, project club, foods and needlework divisions of the exhibit section of the county fair. Assistance was given by the Extension leaders in the crops and poultry divisions and in a general livestock exhibit. 22 communities participated in programs of entertainment, recreation, and discussion of timely economic topics. A series of 16 such community gatherings in 14 communities was conducted during the fall. The title 2 ̆ 2 Community Roundups 2 ̆ 2 was coined to designate a type of these special community events. A total attendance of 3700 was recorded for the events both spring and fall. In addition 4 project club achievement days with an attendance of 727; 2 rural youth meetings with an attendance of 300, and 1 recreation meeting sponsored by the Kennedy community with an attendance of over 100, were conducted. The question of 2 ̆ 2 Shall an appropriation be made annually from the general fund of the county for the support of Agricultural Extension work? 2 ̆ 2 received approval at the November 5 election.

In this study the effect of seed mixture (<b>alsike</b> <b>clover,</b> red clover, white clover, white and <b>alsike</b> <b>clover</b> or grass mixture), year (1997, 1998) and grazing period (5 per grazing season) on the herbage calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K) phosphorous (P) and sodium (Na) contents was assessed and the relationships between botanical proportions and herbage mineral contents were studied. Herbage Ca and Na contents varied between the seed mixtures, Ca, Mg, P and Na contents between the years and all measured minerals, except Na, between the grazing periods. The white clover mixture resulted in higher Ca and Na contents. The contents of Ca and Mg were positively related with the proportions of clovers and weeds and were higher in 1997. The contents of P and K {{were higher in the}} rainy summer of 1998. The seed mixtures resulted in similar mean K/(Ca + Mg) equivalent ratios, but the Ca/P ratio was higher for the white clover mixture. Mineral rations varied between and within grazing seasons. Under organic practices the supply of minerals in the pasture herbage varied temporally and according to the botanical contents and was unable to meet fully the requirements of dairy cows. Additional mineral feeding is recommended for organic farming systems to balance the dietary mineral contents for grazing cows. ...|$|E
40|$|A grazed field {{experiment}} {{based on a}} randomised block design was conducted in Eastern Finland to evaluate the potential of <b>alsike</b> <b>clover</b> (Trifoliun hybridum L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) to support herbage production from clover-grass mixtures under organic farming practices. The effect of seed mixture (<b>alsike</b> <b>clover,</b> red clover, white clover, white and <b>alsike</b> <b>clover</b> or grass mixture), year (1996, 1997 and 1998) and grazing period (5 per grazing season) on pre- and post-grazing herbage mass (HM), botanical and chemical composition of pregrazing HM and post-grazing sward height was assessed. The nutritive value of herbage for milk production was also considered. Seed mixtures resulted in different pre-grazing HM and post-grazing sward heights, but similar pre- minus post-grazing HM. Compared with other mixtures, the proportion of clover was higher for white clover based mixtures. The white clover mixture had the highest crude protein content and lowest concentrations of cellulose and hemicellulose. In addition to seed mixture, the effect of year and grazing period on measured parameters was significant, highlighting the importance of grazing management. Moderate pasture herbage production of relative high nutritive value was achieved under organic practices, but the supply and nutritive value of herbage was variable and, in some cases, unable {{to meet the requirements}} of lactating dairy cows. The proportion of clover in all seed mixtures decreased year on year, and was subject to seasonal variations that altered the nutritional value of herbage. White clover was the most suitable perennial clover for pastures in Eastern Finland. ...|$|E
40|$|Over sixteen years, 49 {{horses were}} {{diagnosed}} by Alberta Agriculture Animal Health laboratories as having “alsike clover poisoning”. There was a distinct northwestern distribution of cases, the majority {{coming from the}} Peace River district. This distribution is opposite {{to that of the}} Alberta horse population, but coincides with areas of <b>alsike</b> <b>clover</b> cultivation. Cases could be divided into chronic or nervous clinical presentations, as described by Schofield. Tissues from 45 animals were retrieved and examined microscopically. Significant histological lesions were confined to the liver and consisted of biliary fibrosis and epithelial proliferation...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{yield and}} quality of forage {{following}} species of forage legumes were evaluated with regard to precipitations: lucerne (Medicago sativa L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.), kura clover (Trifolium ambiguum M.), <b>alsike</b> <b>clover</b> (Trifolium hybridum L.) and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.). The trial was sown {{in the spring of}} 2008, evaluated in the period 2009 – 2011. Analysis of samples was performed with the apparatus NIRS 6500. Following parameters were evaluated: production of dry matter, energy concentration (NEL), contents of fibre and crude protein. The highest three year yield average was measured for lucerne (15. 01 t. ha− 1), followed by red clover group (9. 3 – 11. 8 t. ha− 1). Kura clover gained the lowest yield (1. 97 t. ha− 1). The average crude protein contents (g. kg− 1) were: lucerne 211. 47, red clover group (184. 3 – 194. 8), white clover group (229. 1 – 238. 7) and birdsfoot trefoil (204. 2). The obtained results indicated that lucerne responded at best to periods of drought. Although the production of dry matter decreased in periods of drought, the canopy of stands remained to be complete in contradistinction to white clover, which partly disappeared from the stand. Red clover and <b>alsike</b> <b>clover</b> disappeared from the stand during the trial...|$|E
