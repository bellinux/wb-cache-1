25|$|While still {{considered}} one of the most polluted places on the planet, the valley's air pollution problems are not <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were several decades ago. One major problem that was brought under control was the lead contamination in the air with the introduction of unleaded gasoline. Two other contaminants that have been brought under control are carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. The contamination problems that remain are primarily with ozone and fine particles (soot) (between 2.5micrometers and 10micrometers). Thirty to fifty percent of the time, Mexico City's levels of fine particles of ten micrometers, the most dangerous, exceed levels recommended by the World Health Organization.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April, 2010. He thought that the Ferengi were a [...] "one note" [...] opponent for the crew, but that in this episode they weren't <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were in [...] "". He thought that the plot made the crew look a little silly, saying [...] "Put it this way: if somebody showed up at your door and said, [...] "Hey, we want to give you this weapon you used to murder a bunch of guys we knew years ago," [...] wouldn't you be a little suspicious?" [...] He gave the episode an overall mark of C+. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in November 2012, and said that it was the best episode of the series up until that point. He thought that little touches such as the Stargazer using the movie-era effect for warp drive was a cute touch as it was meant to be an older ship than the Enterprise but also pointed out that [...] "it also means that the Picard Manoeuvre is completely invalidated, because you literally see the ship move from point A to B before the original disappears". He felt that the conflict between Picard and Bok was well realised, and that the characterisation was good.|$|E
2500|$|Sachs also {{described}} Naomi as a layered character whose nature would be explored as the series progressed. With regard to playing such roles, McCord stated, [...] "I tend {{to reach out}} to people like Clark because I can see they are putting on a facade and are not <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> seem. They will eventually let their guard down and become nice people." [...] The actress opted not to review the original series before beginning her role in the spin-off, expressing a desire for Naomi to have her own identity.|$|E

And besides, these lotteries, and the betting about the run of the ship, are <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> gambling. <b>They</b> are gambling, in fact." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would like}} to try, but I'm no sure it would act in every case. I have come across some women <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> the men; <b>they</b> would drive their husbands on." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Economist at {{the time}} alleged that these signs were [...] "not <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> look," [...] since Mexico is more democratic, it enjoys a {{competitive}} export market, has a well-run economy despite the crisis, and there are tentative signs that {{the violence in the}} country may be plummeting. But if voters want the PRI back, it is because [...] "the alternatives [...] weak." [...] The newspaper also alleges that Mexico's preferences should have gone left-wing, but the candidate that represented that movement – Andrés Manuel López Obrador – was seen with [...] "disgraceful behavior." [...] The conservative candidate, Josefina Vázquez Mota, was deemed worthy, but was considered by The Economist to have carried out a [...] "shambolic campaign." [...] Thus, Peña Nieto wins by default and was considered by the newspaper as the [...] "least bad choice" [...] for reform in Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|Netanyahu defines {{capitalism}} as [...] "the {{ability to}} have individual initiative and competition to produce goods and services with profit, but not to shut out somebody else from {{trying to do the}} same." [...] He says that his views developed while he was working as an economic consult for Boston Consulting Group: [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the Boston Consulting Group looked at governments and worked for governments. They wanted to do a strategic plan for the government of Sweden. I was on that case and looked at other governments. So I went around to other governments in Europe in 1976 and I was looking at Britain. I was looking at France. I was looking at other countries, and I could see that they were stymied by concentrations of power that prevented competition. And I thought, hmm, <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are, ours was worse because we had very little room for private sector competition to the extent that we had government-controlled or union-controlled companies, and so you really didn't get the competition or the growth... And I said, well, if I ever have a chance, I'll change that." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{boys were}} {{assigned}} to a small room next to that occupied by Captain Moore and Lieutenant Carrol. The apartment was neatly furnished with iron cots, an iron washstand, and a small wardrobe for extra clothing. Fortunately the extra clothing they had carried had not been stolen, so <b>they</b> were not <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> off <b>as</b> <b>they</b> would otherwise have been.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, yes. Here's the wire. They'll {{put you on}} relief-works,' Raines went on, 'with a {{horde of}} Madrassis dying like flies; one native apothecary and half a pint of cholera-mixture among the ten {{thousand}} of you. It comes of your being idle for the moment. Every man who isn't doing two men's work {{seems to have been}} called upon. Hawkins evidently believes in Punjabis. It's going to be quite <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> anything <b>they</b> have had in the last ten years.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Like it, ay, {{they like}} it well. At fist we were {{somewhat}} afraid o' the landin' in rough weather, but we've got used to that now. The only bad {{thing about it is}} in the rolling o' that horrible Pharos. She's so bad in a gale that I sometimes think she'll roll right over like a cask. Most of us get sick then, but I don't think any of 'em are <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> me. <b>They</b> seem to be gettin' used to that too. I wish I could. Another blow, Ruby." ...|$|R

Maybe"--and she smiled in a half-wistful manner--"it's as well to do {{something}} worth the remembering when ye are young. There's {{a long time to}} sit still in afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may say that," [...] he said. [...] "Well, {{what does}} it amount to? Before I picked you up, I had one eighteen-penny fare to-day; and {{yesterday}} I took five shillings. And I've got seven bob a day {{to pay for the}} cab, and that's low, too. There's many and many a proprietor that's broke and gone--every bit <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> us. <b>They</b> let us down as easy <b>as</b> ever <b>they</b> can; you can't get blood from a stone, can you?" [...] Once again he smiled. [...] "I'm sorry for them, too, and I'm sorry for the horses, though they come out best of the three of us, I do believe." ...|$|R

5000|$|On {{the evening}} of Sunday 28 December 1879, a violent storm (10 to 11 on the Beaufort scale) was blowing {{virtually}} {{at right angles to}} the bridge. Witnesses said the storm was <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> any <b>they</b> had seen in the 20-30 years they had lived in the area; one called it a 'hurricane', <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> a typhoon he had seen in the China Sea. The wind speed was measured at Glasgow - 71 mph (averaged over an hour) - and Aberdeen, but not at Dundee. Higher windspeeds were recorded over shorter intervals, but at the inquiry an expert witness warned of their unreliability, and declined to estimate conditions at Dundee from readings taken elsewhere. [...] One modern interpretation of available information suggests winds were gusting to 80 mph.|$|R
6000|$|... "But a clergyman, you know, Lady De Courcy! He {{should at}} any rate prevent her from exhibiting in public, if he cannot induce her to behave at home. But he is to be pitied. I believe he has a desperate life of it with the lot of them. That apish-looking man there, with the long beard and the loose trousers--he is the woman's brother. He is nearly <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> she is. <b>They</b> are both of them infidels." ...|$|R
50|$|By the 2000s (decade), the 'peoplised' {{transport}} services accounted {{for less than}} a quarter of the daily load of bus passengers. Scarcely a day passed without a letter in the press complaining about overloading, excessive speeds, dangerous driving, rudeness and overcharging on the private buses. The cluster companies did not suffer <b>as</b> much <b>bad</b> publicity, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> endeavoured to observe regulatory requirements and offered a nationwide, if thinly spread service.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hopeful!" [...] {{repeated}} the other, [...] "it's disapinted ye'll be then. Haven't ye often towld me that thim blackguards roast an' tear and torture prisoners nowadays just <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> ever did?" ...|$|E

50|$|Another method {{which may}} be used by {{internet}} service providers, by specialized services or enterprises to combat spam is to require unknown senders to pass various tests before their messages are delivered. These strategies are termed challenge/response systems or C/R. Some view their use <b>as</b> being <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> spam since <b>they</b> place the burden of spam fighting on legitimate email senders—who {{it should be noted}} will often indeed give up at the slightest hindrance. A new implementation of this is done in Channel email.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, just as I got her {{smoothed}} down, {{along comes}} this darned tenement business. Say, Prince, {{for the love}} of Mike cut it out. If those houses are <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> you say <b>they</b> are, and the old lady finds out that I own them, it'll be Katie bar the door for me. She wouldn't stand for it for a moment. I guess I didn't treat you good, Prince, but let's forget it. Ease up on this rough stuff. I'll do anything you want." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You tell me {{to respect}} old people. Why? I don't see nothin' to respect in the old people, I know," [...] she said to Warrington. [...] "They ain't so funny, and I'm sure they ain't so handsome. Look at grandfather; look at Aunt Bernstein. They say she was a beauty once! That picture painted from her! I don't believe it, nohow. No one shall tell me that I shall ever be <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> that! When <b>they</b> come to that, people oughtn't to live. No, that they oughtn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{things are}} not <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> seem; I don't know much about such matters, but I 've seen people who have failed, and they seemed just as {{comfortable}} as before," [...] said Polly.|$|E

50|$|The trainer Börje {{shows the}} team a diagram of their latest {{training}} results {{and it turns}} out that they are all in super shape - saying they are better than Mats Wilander and Boris Becker put together. This gives them a huge dose of self-confidence, making them win every match they play. As they start making lots of money, they fire Börje and Wallner and look for other managers. However, they all start to worry about what to do with all the money they make. Alex wants to invest his, Einar wants to party away, Sigge tries to do something useful with his and Teo tries to give his away to charity, without any luck. When Börje turns up and tells them, that he had misread the diagram and that <b>they</b> are still <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> always, <b>they</b> lose their self-confidence and it's back to work again for the boys.|$|R
50|$|Guatemala {{is ranked}} the 25th most violent {{country in the}} world and Guatemalan police have a {{reputation}} for being non-responsive to the high crime rates. The lack of security within the government is what encouraged the start of mobs turning to vigilante justice. Unfortunately, a lot of the crime associated with these mobs is just <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> the crime <b>they</b> claim they are attempting to prevent. Most of the locals keep quiet for fear of being targeted by these groups themselves, and many of the people participating in the violence are forced to do so.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only that I'm {{going to}} blow it to hell with dynamite," [...] said Harold March, [...] "and I think it right to give you fair warning. For a long time I didn't believe things were <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> you said <b>they</b> were. But I never felt as if I could have bottled up what you knew, supposing you really knew it. Well, the long and the short {{of it is that}} I've got a conscience; and now, at last, I've also got a chance. I've been put in charge of a big {{independent}} paper, with a free hand, and we're going to open a cannonade on corruption." ...|$|R
