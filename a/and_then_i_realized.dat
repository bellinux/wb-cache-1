Because everybody's got an opinion, and so many people's {{opinions}} about me are like polar opposites. They're like, 'We love it when she does ballads, make her do the ballads.' Then they're like, 'We want to hear a hip-hop record.' 'Why is she dressing like this? She should show less skin.' 'She should show more.' You know what I mean? I'm like, 'Stay in your lane, and I'll figure it out.' ...|$|E

The word [...] "bitch" [...] means {{a lot of different}} things. Everything is about context. When I first moved to England and heard the word [...] "cunt", I was horrified.

[...] The word [...] "fuck" [...] doesn't just mean sexual intercourse. I mean, [...] "You're a stupid fuck," [...] "Are you going to fuck with me?" [...] "Fuck off!"... Sex {{has nothing to do with}} any of those expressions, and the same goes for [...] "bitch". If I say to you, [...] "I'm a badass bitch," [...] I'm owning myself, I'm saying, [...] "I'm strong, I'm tough, and don't mess with me." [...] If I say, [...] "Why are you being such a bitch to me?," [...] well, that means something else.|$|E

60|$|A single glance {{showed me}} several cows running as if bewildered, and near them {{a big white}} wolf pulling down a calf. Another white wolf stood not far off. My horse jumped {{as if he had}} been shot; and the {{realization}} darted upon me that here was where the certain something began. Spot--the mustang had one black spot in his pure white--snorted like I imagined a blooded horse might, under dire insult. Jones's bay had gotten about a hundred paces the start. I lived to learn that Spot hated to be left behind; moreover, he would not be left behind; he was the swiftest horse on the range, and proud of the distinction. I cast one unmentionable word on the breeze toward the cabin and Frank, then put mind and muscle to the sore task of remaining with Spot. Jones was born on a saddle, and had been taking his meals in a saddle for about sixty-three years, and the bay horse could run. Run is not a felicitous word--he flew. And I was rendered mentally deranged for the moment to see that hundred paces between the bay and Spot materially lessen at every jump. Spot lengthened out, seemed to go down near the ground, and cut the air like a high-geared auto. If I had not heard the fast rhythmic beat of his hoofs, and had not bounced high into the air at every jump, I would have been sure I was riding a bird. I tried to stop him. As well might I have tried to pull in the Lusitania with a thread. Spot was out to overhaul that bay, and in spite of me, he was doing it. The wind rushed into my face and sang in my ears. Jones seemed the nucleus of a sort of haze, and it grew larger and larger. Presently he became clearly defined in my sight; the violent commotion under me subsided; I once more felt the saddle, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that Spot had been content to stop alongside of Jones, tossing his head and champing his bit.|$|E

This delay was in no way your fault as it had the correct APO number only I have had several changes since I last wrote to you. Lots of my mail has been sent to APO # 887, Paris, by mistake <b>and</b> <b>then</b> lay-over {{on that side of the}} channel is sometimes over a month. Several weeks ago I was able to contact John Wood who is now recuperating in a hospital here in the UK after having broken a leg 2 ̆ 2 Somewhere in Belgium. 2 ̆ 2 He seems to be in good spirits and I hope that he 2 ̆ 7 ll be able to get down here to London on leave. Last Monday I called the hospital to see if he was still there and I was transferred to his ward and was able to talk to him personally. He told me that he was hobbling around but that it seemed so good to get out of bed. I had intended to get a forty-eight hour pass and visit him this week as I have it due me but thought that I 2 ̆ 7 d let it lay-over another week or so. Prior to visiting John I received a letter from Dr. Wilbur with whom I have been writing ever since entering the Army that he had finally arrived in the UK. I immediately answered his letter and planned to meet either in London or at his station. He decided that he would prefer coming to London and seeing the sights. We spent twenty-four hours together and had several photos taken which incidentally didn 2 ̆ 7 t come out. He hasn 2 ̆ 7 t changed a bit since the days when we were back in Bryant. We planned to get together again but he was 2 ̆ 2 alerted 2 ̆ 2 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> moved across the Channell to France. It is now 8 : 00 in the evening, Washington 2 ̆ 7 s birthday at that, and I find myself attempting to get caught up on correspondence. It doesn 2 ̆ 7 t seem possible that it is my third holiday overseas. It seems that my job hasn 2 ̆ 7 t been one in which there has been a great deal of glamour attached but it has been interesting. Our office has clothed, fed, and furnished PI rations to all the troops in the ETO prior to D-day. Now it is our duty to do the same for the troops that are still here in the UK. Over a period of two years we have seen this whole operation grow into a very complex structure with numerous obstacles that had to be and were overcome. Sometimes I wonder if I 2 ̆ 7 m doing my part <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> that someone has to make sure that the me[n] up front are taken care of at all times. At present I 2 ̆ 7 m sweating out the newly instigated Rotation Plan but I don 2 ̆ 7 t suppose that I 2 ̆ 7 ll be lucky in the drawing when it takes place. Somehow I prefer remaining here until it is all over <b>and</b> <b>then</b> returning for good. It looks as though the 2 ̆ 2 V 2 ̆ 2 is appearing so will have to close, thanking you again and wishing you the best throughout the coming year. Sincerely, Bill[Transcription ends...|$|R
5000|$|According to AbsolutePunk.net, McMahon {{had this}} to say about the new album, [...] "I {{consider}} 'People and Things' a relationship record. My goal with many of the songs was to strip away the flowery language and sentiment attached to newer love and replace it with starker, less blinded language about more binding love. In the time following the last Jack's album the people in my world were moving in together, getting married, trying to find quote unquote 'real jobs' and reconciling new lives that looked a lot less like youth than some of us cared for. Marriage is a bit of a beast to tackle in a pop record but when I wrote 'My Racing Thoughts,' it became clear how powerful and loaded a subject this kind of love is and somewhere in that moment I began to lock into the broad concept for the writing sessions to come." [...] In another (unrelated) interview, McMahon established [...] "this album should be different than the previous few. The first (Everything In Transit) was about breaking up, the second (The Glass Passenger) was about getting sick and recovering from it. I hated that album at first, until we wrote this one (People <b>and</b> Things) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>then</b> <b>realized</b> how proud <b>I</b> am of all of my work.

Do I forget {{the sound of my}} own voice between Monday and Saturday? I should think not. Nor do I forget Janet's voice. I have read somewhere that the Scotch are a very taciturn race, but Janet is far more Scotch than the haggis that is passed around at some London dinners, and Janet is not a silent woman. The {{difficulty}} with some servants is to get them to answer your summons, but my difficulty with Janet is to get her back to the kitchen. Her favorite position is at the door, which she keeps half open. One of her feet she twists round it, and there she stands, half {{out of the room and}} half in it. She has a good deal of gossip to tell me about those five houses that lie low, two hundred yards from the manse, and it must be admitted that I listen. Why not? If one is interested in people he must gossip about them. You, in London, may not care in the least who your next door neighbor is, but you gossip about your brothers and sisters and aunts. Well, my people are as familiar to me as your brothers are to you, and, therefore, I say, [...] "Ah, indeed," [...] when told that the smith is busy with the wheel of a certain farmer's cart, and [...] "Dear me, is that so?" [...] when Janet explains that William, the ploughman, has got Meggy, his wife, to cut his hair. Meggy has cut my own hair. She puts a bowl on my head and clips away everything that it does not cover. So I would miss Janet if she were gone, and her tongue is as enlivening as a strong ticking clock. No doubt there are times when, if I were not a minister, I might fling something soft at her. She shows to least advantage when I have visitors, and even in winter I have a man to dinner now <b>and</b> again. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> that Janet does not know her place. While we are dining she hovers in the vicinity. If she is not pretending to put the room to rights, she is in her fortified position at the door; and if she is not at the door she is immediately behind it. Her passion is to help in the conversation. As she brings in the potatoes she answers the last remark my guest addressed to me, and if I am too quick for her she explains away my answer, or modifies it, or signifies her approval of it. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> try to be dignified and to show Janet her place. If I catch her eye I frown, but such opportunities are rare, for it is the guest on whom she concentrates herself. She even tells him, in my presence, little things about myself which I would prefer to keep to myself. The impression conveyed by her is that I confide everything to her.
