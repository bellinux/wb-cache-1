40|$|The {{topics of}} {{leadership}} and strategy have attracted considerable interest from both academics and practitioners. Much of the interest in the two areas is based on explicit and implicit claims that both leadership and strategy are linked to organisational performance. This paper examines {{the nature of the}} relationship between participative leadership style and performance, and <b>authoritative</b> <b>leadership</b> style and performance. The study hypothesised that <b>authoritative</b> <b>leadership</b> style leads to achievement of the objectives of a strategic plan (hypothesis 1), and that participative leadership style leads to achievement of the objectives of a strategic plan (hypothesis 2). The research was a quantitative study. Data was collected by means of a questionnaire, which was emailed to 200 randomly selected respondents. 48 responses were received. This represents a total response rate of 24 %. Of the total 48 responses, 10 were eliminated from the study due to errors. A linear regression method was used to test the hypotheses. The regression analyses have revealed that participative leadership style and performance, and <b>authoritative</b> <b>leadership</b> style and performance are not related. The two variables each explain less than 1 % of the variance in performance. As a result, both null hypotheses were not rejected.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{discussions on}} {{leadership}} and strategy have attracted considerable interest from academics {{on one hand}} and business practitioners on the other. Much of the interest lies in claims that both leadership and strategy are linked to business performance. This research report examines {{the nature of the relationship}} between different leadership styles and organisation performance. The research study hypothesised that either <b>authoritative</b> <b>leadership</b> style leads to achievement of the business strategic plan (hypothesis 1) or that participative leadership style leads to achievement of the business strategic plan (hypothesis 2). The research was a quantitative study; data was collected by means of interviews and telephone questionnaires which were administered on 38 randomly selected business owners and senior managers. A linear regression method was used to test the hypothesis. The regression analyses revealed that participative leadership style and performance and <b>authoritative</b> <b>leadership</b> style are not related. These two variables each explain less than one per cent of the variance in performance. As a result, both null hypotheses were not rejected.

A related objective was to examine the relationship between Korean principals 2 ̆ 7 leadership styles and their job satisfaction. A literature review traced the history of educational administration in South Korea, leadership styles, cross cultural leadership studies, and Confucian culture. ^ A purposeful sample of Korean secondary school principals (n = 292) was taken. The study tested the interaction between Confucianism and Korean principal 2 ̆ 7 s leadership styles and Herzberg 2 ̆ 7 s motivator-hygiene theory by factor analysis, correlation, and regression. ^ The study found the following: (1) Confucianism has a strong impact on the secondary school Korean principals; (2) Korean principals reported adherence to both <b>authoritative</b> and democratic <b>leadership</b> styles; (3) Korean principals reported a relationship between Confucian values and Herzberg 2 ̆ 7 s motivators. No relationship was reported between Confucian values and Herzberg 2 ̆ 7 s hygiene factors; (4) Data from the sample revealed that Korean administrators come to their position late in their careers, are predominantly male, and usually fifty years or older; (5) No relationships were found between school characteristics and demographic characteristics and leadership or motivation variables. ^ The study concludes by suggesting that any attempt to change or westernize the cultural context of educational administration in Korea must accommodate the strong adherence to Confucian values. Second, since there was no discrimination by the respondents between <b>authoritative</b> and democratic <b>leadership</b> styles, the concepts imbedded in these traditional measures of leadership may be too grounded in western conceptions of leadership to serve well in the Korean context. Third, principals reported being motivated more by Herzberg 2 ̆ 7 s motivators than by hygienes, a factor that must be considered in any educational reform effort in Korea. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{was prompted by}} a concern about implementation {{based on the premise}} that in Ireland the policy system has been good at designing policies but has been inconsistent in its ability to implement them, leading to frustrations on the part of policy makers and service users alike. Recourse to the implementation literature identifies a complex array of approaches and variables which are suggested as influencing implementation, causing one researcher to comment that there are too few cases and too many variables. In a search for the main determinants of implementation, this research classifies some of these variables according to the main ideological stable of the implementation researchers as being driven from the 'top down' or 'bottom up' or being 'transformative', in that they are associated with change. A number of variables are present in all these approaches and are classified as 'common' variables. Taking the mental health policy A Vision for Change, which is recognised as being a policy of international standing, developed by an intensive and inclusive process, approved by government and with cross party political support, the content of the reports of an Independent Monitoring Group were analysed and interviews undertaken with people associated with implementation of the policy The results demonstrate that all of the variables identified played a role in the implementation of A Vision for Change but some were more influential than others. <b>Authoritative</b> accountable <b>leadership</b> and identifying the main resistors to change and addressing these were found to be fundamental to successful implementation. Other variables were found to be necessary but not sufficient on their own while others played a more contributory role. This finding has relevance for the implementation of nationally designed policies which are intended to be implemented across the country in an even-handed way.

40|$|Summary of {{the thesis}} This thesis investigates various aspects that are {{important}} for developing teams {{that are able to}} excel through uncertainty. It is possible to read the Part I as a short summary of the whole work. The first part begins with a literature review {{that can be used to}} understand the various trends in the team literature, and thereby help leaders to understand the implications from the different perspectives. At the same time, the perspective I advocate builds on the premise of enabling teams to adapt to their contextual demands, which means that a focus upon the teams’ internal interplay is highly important. The second part of the thesis consists of four separate articles that visit topics such as team building; team insights and perceptions; the distribution of influence, and leadership perspectives and structures. These articles can be read separately, but reading the whole thesis will help to give a broader insight. For many leaders, some of the suggestions will be inconsistent with long-held leadership- and team theories. The focus on the “soft” sides of teamwork, instead of task and procedures, can be quite different from established practices and knowledge bases. Indeed, the implications of focusing on behaviors, curiosity, and collective mutual understanding can be quite far from focusing on technical and task-oriented discussions. However, these “soft” oriented discussions help teams to foster new insight and knowledge and to facilitate adaptable behaviors. The idea of abandoning an <b>authoritative</b> controlling <b>leadership</b> style in crisis settings will truly be counterintuitive and surprising, and maybe even provoking, for many leaders. Nevertheless, I hope that reading this thesis helps to broaden leadership perspectives and, by this, spark interesting discussions within organizations that rely on teamwork in uncertain and ambiguous contexts...|$|R

The main objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of different leadership styles (transformational, transactional, autocratic, and laissez-faire leadership styles) on employees’ performance of employees. A cross section descriptive survey research strategy was adopted in which 80 usable structured questionnaires were collected from 300 questionnaires distributed. The leadership styles were measured through the Multi factor Leadership Questionnaire developed by Avolio and Bass (1995), modified to fit the context of the study. Employee performance was measured by the scale of Yousef (2000). Descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were used for data analysis. In inferential statistics, Pearson’s correlation and regression analysis were used to assess both relationships and effects as per the hypotheses of the study. The findings show that transformational leadership style is the most exhibited style at the bank followed by the transactional leadership style and laissez-faire. Employee performance is above average. Overall, scores in transformational leadership style were found to be strongly correlated with both measures of employee performance and overall performance except for the intellectual simulation dimension, which had insignificant positive correlation with quality of performance. Transactional leadership style was found to be positively correlated with both measures of employee performance as well as overall performance. However, contingent rewards had a negative but insignificant correlation with performance while management by exception had insignificant positive correlations. <b>Authoritative</b> <b>leadership</b> style had insignificant relationship while laissez faire style had insignificant positive correlation. The results suggest that supervisors in organizations need to use a lot of transformational leadership behaviors or rather embrace transformational leadership style, but not laissez-faire leadership. From the results, transformational leadership could have greater effects on employee productivity and quality of performance. It is recommended therefore that Transformational and transactional leaderships are the most effective leadership styles.

Yet, in the English speaking world Rokossovskiy is unknown, a name, vaguely associated with famous events. There is no sustained historical analysis of Rokossovskiy’s style of leadership and operational command in the English language. Rokossovskiy rejected the authoritarian leadership culture of Stalin’s Soviet Union and Zhukov’s Red Army. Rokossovskiy was highly demanding and occasionally harsh but his leadership encouraged initiative, consultation, trust, delegation and tolerated mistakes in a way that made him unusual, indeed exceptional, in the Red Army. It was primarily an <b>authoritative</b> style of <b>leadership</b> but Rokossovskiy practised different forms and styles of leadership guided by his own instinctive judgement according to the demands of the situation and the nature of his subordinates. This was a considered philosophy of leadership and command that set him apart from his contemporaries. Rokossovskiy’s style of leadership was intimately connected to his conduct of operations. As one of the Red Army’s finest commanders, respected by the Wehrmacht and the Red Army, Rokossovskiy’s operational art was dominated by the idea of depth. Rokossovskiy, the Pole, was the heir to a long Russian tradition, centuries old, of deep operations, whereas Zhukov, the Russian, was committed to operational encirclement and annihilation, a Germanic concept.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of the study are to identify the leadership styles (transformational, transactional and laissez-faire) of the campus principals/divisional directors of a public university in Pakistan, {{examine the relationship between}} these leadership styles and the faculty’s job satisfaction, investigate which elements of the faculty’s job satisfaction are influenced/not influenced by the leader, explore which leadership style is conducive/barrier to the faculty’s job satisfaction, and define the role of a leader in enhancing the faculty’s job satisfaction. The study adopted a mixed methods approach, and all the 287 faculty members of the university were included in the sample to collate quantitative data through two questionnaires, whereas to generate qualitative data 15 faculty members were interviewed through the semi-structured protocol. The findings suggest that the transformational leadership style is comparatively being more often exercised by the leaders of the case public university in Pakistan, followed by the transactional leadership style, while the laissez-faire leadership style is the least practised. There are significant relationships between leadership styles (transformational, transactional and laissez-faire) and the faculty’s intrinsic, extrinsic and overall job satisfaction. The transformational leadership style, in relation to the transactional and laissez-faire styles, has a strong positive and statistically significant effect on faculty’s job satisfaction. Whereas, the laissez-faire leadership style, relatively, has weak positive and statistically insignificant effect on the job satisfaction of faculty members. The transactional leadership style, on the other hand, has comparatively weak negative and statistically insignificant effect on faculty’s job satisfaction. Most of the faculty job satisfaction elements related to the institution, leader and job are influenced by the leader; whereas, several factors that are more linked with the faculty members themselves, their colleagues and students are not influenced by the leader.

40|$|Leadership has {{attracted}} {{a significant amount of}} scholarly attention in the past few decades. However, most research and theory contributions are to a great extent limited to accounting for leadership practices in the West (Littrell, 2002). This study is designed to develop an effective leadership model that works in the Chinese context. Paternalistic leadership, a dominant leadership style in an Eastern business environment, is compared with transformational leadership, a dominant leadership style in a Western business environment. The notion of transformational leadership was developed under the tutelage of Bernard Bass (1998). Transformational leadership is found to be compatible with collectivistic values (Walumbwa & Lwwler, 2003) and is believed to be appealing and generalizable to Chinese leadership situations (Chen & Farh, 1999). Other researchers have found that within Chinese organizations, leader behaviors are quite distinct from transformational leadership, referring to this leader style as paternalistic leadership (Redding, 1990; Cheng, 1995). The questions are asked, “Transformational or paternalistic leadership, which one is more effective in Chinese organizations? Is one type of leadership superior to the other one in the Chinese culture?” To answer these questions, a model is proposed to clarify the mediating effects of trust and harmony on the relationship between leadership style and its effectiveness, and to interpret the moderating effects of generation on the relationships between both paternalistic and transformational leadership with trust and harmony. Most theories of leadership in organizational behavior originated in the United States and Western Europe and are hypothesized to be universally applicable to non-Western contexts. Departing from this tradition, the current study proposes a Chinese culture-specific leadership theory, built on traditional Confucianism. The principle aim is to examine and articulate a culturally informed and warranted ground for a leadership model in the Chinese context. The results of the study provide a new perspective on leadership in the Chinese context by focusing on three dimensions of paternalistic <b>leadership</b> (<b>authoritative,</b> benevolent, and moral leadership) that are ignored in the Western leadership literature. The results also suggest that trust in the leader and harmonious relationships in an organization are key mechanisms for explaining effective leadership in Chinese organizations regardless of whether paternalistic or transformational leadership is used. What’s more, as the younger generation is becoming the dominant workforce, a successful leader in China should use Western practices and integrate them to fit in Chinese organizations in a way that also acknowledges Chinese traditions...|$|R
40|$|Since independence, the Namibian {{education}} system {{has experienced a}} process of transformation from authoritarianism to democratisation. The philosophy underpinning this process is spelt out in the policy, Toward Education for All, with its four major goals being: Access, Equity, Quality and Democracy. Democratisation of education would mean that people would be equally involved in decision‐making processes both at the system and organizational level, so as to contribute collectively to shaping the destiny of education in Namibia. This would mean at the school level of an organization, that teachers are the facilitators of democracy and agents {{of change in the}} learning organization environment. To strengthen democracy and empower people’s participation in the decision‐making process, Namibia further adopted a decentralization policy which involved the devolution of power and administrative functions from central government to regional authorities. In the context of this policy framework, schools should take responsibility to introduce and manage change in their organizations. However, evidence suggests that schools have been slow to take up the challenge and that change is largely still initiated by regional officials. This study looks at how organisation development (OD) {{may play a role in}} encouraging a mindset where change may be initiated by the organisation itself. OD is a planned change strategy based on normative re‐educative and empirical rational strategies implemented systematically. OD is participant driven, involving a series of activities that move the organization to a preferred future. It focuses on human behaviour and organizational change through staff participation practising a bottom‐up rather than top‐down approach. This study reports on an OD intervention in a rural school east of Rundu, in the Kavango Educational region of Namibia. The study aimed at exploring staff involvement in an OD intervention and probed participants’ perceptions and experiences of the process. The study is an action research case study located within the interpretive and critical paradigms. Observation and semi‐structured interviews were the main data‐collection tools used in the study. In its preliminary investigation the study found that a lack of staff involvement in decisionmaking processes and participation in meetings were the major factors that were perceived to retard the effectiveness of the organization. The study further found that the <b>authoritative</b> style of <b>leadership</b> in the school contributed to the lack of cooperation and participation of staff members. In contrast, the staff responded positively to the OD intervention. Participants embraced OD as a democratic approach to change as it made a meaningful impact on their understanding and conception of organization change. The intervention further empowered participants with new skills and knowledge of initiating change and problem‐solving. Apart from that, the intervention provided a possible short‐term outcome that encouraged participants to adopt and apply OD in the future, without underestimating the difficulties associated with the process. ...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{medicine}} {{is a medical}} specialty at the centre of healthcare. When used optimally laboratory medicine generates knowledge that can facilitate patient safety, improve patient outcomes, shorten patient journeys and lead to more cost-effective healthcare. Optimal use of laboratory medicine relies on dynamic and <b>authoritative</b> <b>leadership</b> outside as well as inside the laboratory. The first responsibility {{of the head of}} a clinical laboratory is to ensure the provision of a high quality service across a wide range of parameters culminating in laboratory accreditation against an international standard, such as ISO 15189. From that essential baseline the leadership of laboratory medicine at local, national and international level needs to ‘add value’ to ensure the optimal delivery, use, development and evaluation of the services provided for individuals and for groups of patients. A convenient tool to illustrate added value is use of the mnemonic ‘SCIENCE’. This tool allows added value to be considered in seven domains: standardisation and harmonisation; clinical effectiveness; innovation; evidence-based practice; novel applications; cost-effectiveness; and education of others. The assessment of added value in laboratory medicine may be considered against a framework that comprises three dimensions: operational efficiency; patient management; and patient behaviours. The profession and the patient will benefit from sharing examples of adding value to laboratory medicine...|$|E

In this period was established Italien fascism based on nationalism, <b>authoritative</b> <b>leadership,</b> militarism and a strong economic role of state. Corporativism {{can be described as}} a political and social theory characterises by a limited number of organizations, which have a public monopoly to represent an interests of each such a group. These organizations then negotiate with state authorities and influence public policy. But there are many theories describing corporativism and it is dividend into two different types. Fascist Italy was an example of an authoritative corporativism. Italien fascist claimed that corporativism will create a new relation between economy and state through a cooperation between groups of employers and employees. But there was a signifiant diference between the theory and a real economic situation in Italy. Corporativism was basically just an instrument used by the fascist party to control main economic interests and through a promotion of a military industry prepare Italy to war. The thesis is composed of seven chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of corporative system of Fascist Italy. Chapter One is introductory and describes my purposes for chosing [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Many psychiatric nurses working in the community are changing their occupational base. They are working increasingly {{as members of a}} mental health multi-disciplinary team. This is a report on aspects {{of the role of the}} psychiatric nurse working in such teams. Freidson's professional-dominance thesis is used as a theoretical framework to assess the occupational status of psychiatric nurses working in the community mental health team. In particular, the levels of clinical autonomy experienced by the nurse are explored. Four community mental health teams are examined, using Diary-interview Schedules to record how new clients are processed by the psychiatric nurse. The other members of the teams were interviewed (as were the managers to whom the nurses were accountable) using Focused-interview Schedules. Furthermore, Field-notes were made of substantive, methodological, and pre-analytical observations made during visits to the team centres. The report concludes that although there is an occupational hierarchy and inter-disciplinary rivalry in the teams, the psychiatric nurse enjoys a large amount of de facto clinical autonomy. The psychiatric nurse has also a dynamic and invariably unsupervised influence on the creation and pathway of psychiatric careers for those who are referred to her or him. Recommendations include the need to affirm <b>authoritative</b> <b>leadership</b> in the team, and for formal supervisory procedures to be installed. It is also recommended that psychiatric nurses in the community should re-assess their occupational strategy of professionalisation, with a view to a re-alignment with medical practitioners...|$|E
40|$|This Doctor of Ministry thesis {{explores the}} need to reclaim the heart of adult catechesis as a {{ministry}} that exists {{for the purpose of}} empowering mature Christian disciples. The encounter on the road to Emmaus provides an inspiring example of a transformative experience that shaped the vision and practice of the early Church. The fifty years since the Second Vatican Council have seen an attempt to reclaim effective adult catechesis modelled in the early Church. However, a disconnect exists between the vision of adult catechesis expressed in the Church’s documents and its practice. Lacunae in empirical research in adult catechesis confound this problem. 	A central goal {{of this study is to}} contribute to a needed body of empirical research that studies adult catechesis. Using a mixed method approach of quantitative and qualitative instruments, I conducted a case study of Putting Out into the Deep, an adult catechetical series that I designed and led, in collaboration with an Advisory Committee, in the Archdiocese of Ottawa. Using case study methodology allowed me to study the series as a bounded system. I gathered a mix of quantitative (a 50 item random sample survey sent to 50 participants in the catechetical series) and qualitative evidence (small group semi-structured interviews with 10 participants and 7 pastoral leaders associated with the series) using multiple data collection techniques. This allowed me to search for processes that empower mature Christian disciples and to identify some obstacles to effective adult catechesis. 	The Church’s normative documents regarding adult catechesis provide a foundation for theological reflection in this research, and literature from adult catechesis, adult development (and faith development), transformative learning, sociology of religion and practical theology provide the conceptual framework. 	The case study presents one model of collaborative curriculum building that demonstrates that it is possible to construct adult catechesis that honours both comprehensive adult catechesis, and the significant faith and life questions of participants. The findings from this study both corroborate and expand some current theories related to effective adult catechesis. The findings regarding effective adult catechesis include: it is characterized by processes, such as those used for theological reflection, that engages critical thinking; it is marked by <b>authoritative</b> support, competent <b>leadership</b> and a commitment to the empowerment of mature Christian disciples; it invites the whole community to take responsibility, and involves participants in the ongoing planning and evaluation of the process; it is impeded by pastoral leaders - lay and ordained – who may support it verbally but not in practice; it is impeded by indoctrination. The need to embrace the expertise of transformative learning and adult development theory is particularly evident from the findings. 	As a work in practical theology seeking renewed praxis, reflection on the Church’s normative texts in dialogue with the research findings emphasizes the duty of those who are responsible for this ministry to engage in critical reflection that identifies obstacles, renews vision, and strengthens commitment to providing effective adult catechesis that empowers mature Christian disciples...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} with literature models and combined with interviews seeks {{to answer the}} question, firstly, how the concept of women 2 ̆ 7 s leadership in the perspective of Islamic law. Secondly, a comparative analysis of KH. Husein Muhammad 2 ̆ 7 s thought and Prof. Siti Musdah Mulia 2 ̆ 7 s thought on women 2 ̆ 7 s leadership. The conclusion {{of this study is}} that the Islamic law (Shariah) does not provide a practical explanation of a firm and clear on women 2 ̆ 7 s leadership. Technically it is true that Islam does not provide practical guidance but substantively Islam provides breadth for women to play a role in the public sector. This is because men and women are created in the same position and have the same opportunities in areas such as work and career, including to be the leader. KH. Husein Muhammad as the first figure of this study confirms an understanding that women are actually capable of being a leader among men. In line with that the woman has the right to be a leader as owned by men. Meanwhile, Prof. Siti Musdah Mulia as te second figure expressed the same thing that appreciate women 2 ̆ 7 s leadership. More specifically, he describes the unique and different conception about the character of women 2 ̆ 7 s leadership.

40|$|The term 'orchestral conductor' {{seems to}} evoke images of greatness, divinity, authority, power and tyranny. In the {{conducting}} profession {{those who have}} {{had the power to}} create this role have been men and, thus, through weight of historical and societal precedence masculine leadership is largely unchallenged as the norm on the podium. Renowned for their mythical status, visual prominence, high paying rank, and commanding relationship with the orchestra, conductors have visibly embodied a gendered form of leadership. Up until recently, the only way that women have been able successfully to negotiate these powerfully gendered constructs has been by desexualising themselves and conforming to a male-oriented paradigm in their dress, gestures, behaviour, leadership styles, and familial commitments. (1) In this paper I will limit the discussion to issues relating to power and leadership. Women conductors have had to mould their behaviour in ways that have often been contradictory to what society expects of them as 'normal' females. They have had to find a subtle balance between the <b>authoritative</b> <b>leadership</b> that the conducting profession demands and the more collaborative approach to leadership that they are often socialized to follow. In this paper I will use narrative descriptions to explore the tensions that a number of the world's renowned female conductors have faced in negotiating their way into this leadership position. I will also examine how feminine approaches to this role have the potential to work with the changing dynamics of orchestras today to redefine a number of the role's masculine power constructs.
