40|$|ABSTRACT Life tables {{have been}} {{elaborated}} {{throughout much of}} human history. However, the first life table to use actuarial concepts was only constructed in 1815 by Milne {{for the city of}} Carlisle in England. Since then, numerous tables have been elaborated for different regions and countries, due to their crucial importance for analyzing various types of problems covering a vast range of possibilities, from actuarial studies to forecasting and evaluating demands in order to define public policies. The most common problem nowadays in an <b>actuarial</b> <b>calculation</b> is choosing a suitable table for a given population. Brazil has few specific tables for the pensions market and has been using imported tables that refer to other countries, with different cultures and different mortality experiences. Using data from the Integrated Human Resource Administration System, this table constructs life tables for Executive branch federal civil servants for the period from 1993 to 2014, disaggregated for sex, age, and educational level (high school and university). The international literature has recognized differences in mortality due to sex, socioeconomic differences, and occupation. The creation of the Complementary Pension Foundation for Federal Public Servants in 2013 requires specific mortality tables for this population to support actuarial studies, healthcare, and personnel policies. A mathematical equation is fitted to the data. This equation can be broken down into infant mortality (not present in the data), mortality from external causes, and mortality from senescence. Recent results acknowledging an upper limit for old age mortality are incorporated into the adjusted probabilities of death. Assuming a binomial distribution for deaths, the deviance was used as a figure of merit to evaluate the goodness of fit of the observed data both to a set of tables used by the insurance/pensions market and to the adjusted tables...|$|E
40|$|The most {{abundant}} carcinogen in tobacco smoke or its condensate {{has been identified}} as N-nitrosonornicotine. This is formed predominantly from nicotine in tobacco during curing and smoking but may also be generated within the body. Intravenous injection of 14 C NNN appears highly concentrated in the choroid of pigmented mice. Like nicotine, it crosses the placental barrier and appears in the choroid of the embryonic eye in pregnant female mice. Other studies of the male melanoma population show a trend toward earlier life appearance of malignant melanoma in smokers and significantly less of disease-free melanoma-bearing males at five years among smokers. Immunoglobulin G and natural killer leukocyte activities appear to be reduced in male smokers with or without melanomas. Although species and strain differences in susceptibility to carcinogenic agents are well known, these findings led us to a retrospective analysis of 126 white adults undergoing enucleation as immediate therapy for unilateral malignant melanoma of the choroid between 1958 and 1978. Histologic verification and adequate follow-ups were obtained in 105 patients. Minimum follow-up in 65 survivors was 3 years and maximum was 24 years. In 40 patients with metastatic melanomas, death occurred at 3 months to 13 years or at an average of 44 months following surgery. An adequate history of tobacco use was obtained in 94 patients, 44 of which were positive for tobacco use (32 male; 12 female) and 50 were denials (16 male; 34 female). Questions to female patients or families of deceased women evoked more prompt and uncompromising denial than was experienced in questioning of male patients. Straight (non-actuarial) five year tumor mortality in white males with choroidal malignant melanoma showed 12 of 32 or 37 % dead among male smokers and 1 of 13 or 8 % dead among male non-smokers. <b>Actuarial</b> <b>calculation</b> of five year survival showed only 62 % in tobacco using males and 85 % in non-tobacco using males. The distribution of cytology was essentially similar in groups both by sex and other subgroupings. There were, however, more large tumors (greater than 10 mm in diameter) in the tobacco group (61 %) vs the non-smokers (31 %). These preliminary findings merit further analysis by prospective tobacco histories in malignant melanoma patients, particularly among the male population...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Many {{researchers}} are {{interested to know}} if there are any improvements in recent treatment results for metastatic breast cancer in the community, especially for 10 - or 15 -year survival. Methods Between 1981 and 1985, 782 and 580 female patients with metastatic breast cancer were extracted respectively from the Connecticut and San Francisco-Oakland registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The lognormal statistical method to estimate survival was retrospectively validated since the 15 -year cause-specific survival rates could be calculated using the standard life-table actuarial method. Estimated rates were compared to the actuarial data available in 2000. Between 1991 and 1995, further 752 and 632 female patients with metastatic breast cancer were extracted respectively from the Connecticut and San Francisco-Oakland registries. The data were analyzed to estimate the 15 -year cause-specific survival rates before the year 2005. Results The 5 -year period (1981 – 1985) was chosen, and patients were followed as a cohort for an additional 3 years. The estimated 15 -year cause-specific survival rates were 7. 1 % (95 % confidence interval, CI, 1. 8 – 12. 4) and 9. 1 % (95 % CI, 3. 8 – 14. 4) by the lognormal model for the two registries of Connecticut and San Francisco-Oakland respectively. Since the SEER database provides follow-up information {{to the end of the}} year 2000, <b>actuarial</b> <b>calculation</b> can be performed to confirm (validate) the estimation. The Kaplan-Meier calculation for the 15 -year cause-specific survival rates were 8. 3 % (95 % CI, 5. 8 – 10. 8) and 7. 0 % (95 % CI, 4. 3 – 9. 7) respectively. Using the 1991 – 1995 5 -year period cohort and followed for an additional 3 years, the 15 -year cause-specific survival rates were estimated to be 9. 1 % (95 % CI, 3. 8 – 14. 4) and 14. 7 % (95 % CI, 9. 8 – 19. 6) for the two registries of Connecticut and San Francisco-Oakland respectively. Conclusions For the period 1981 – 1985, the 15 -year cause-specific survival for the Connecticut and the San Francisco-Oakland registries were comparable. For the period 1991 – 1995, there was not much change in survival for the Connecticut registry patients, but there was an improvement in survival for the San Francisco-Oakland registry patients. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} annuity, as a periodical obligation, {{which can}} emanate either from a contract, {{as in the}} case of maintainance or life annuity contract, or from tort. In the latter case, it has the function to provide compensation for future loss, but not in a single payment, which is regularly the consequence of liability for torts. The justification for such successive means of compensation is that by certain types of torts, such {{as in the case}} of disability or decreased ability to work, damage does not appear in one given moment, but accrues periodically, as successive future loss. An employee, for example, suffering personal injury, may become disabled to work or their ability to work may decrease, thereby they may earn less than previously. Damage in this case accrues each month in the amount of the difference between the wages earned before and after the injury. The author differentiates between successive annuity, as a rule, and cumulative annuity (lump sump), as an exception, justified by special considerations on the side of the injured, such as the need to bear the costs of professional retraining, for example. Regarding the determination of the amount of monthly annuity, the subject of analysis was the method of <b>actuarial</b> <b>calculation,</b> which takes into account both present damage and future loss. Due to the hypothetical nature of some elements of such determination, the law allows a subsequent revision of judgment on the amount of annuity, which has become conclusive, if the circumstances concerning the injured person's ability to work has changed substantially in the meantime. For instance, due to the subsequent deterioration of injured person's ability to work, they may earn less or may not earn at all. Such subsequent revision of the judgment does not break through the rules on legal finality of judgments, since the effect of legal finality does not comprise new circumstances of the case. The author supports the standpoint that annuity is an adequate form of compensation for disability or decreased ability to work, since in such case the future loss accrues successively, in monthly differences of wages before and after the injury. Contrarily, by the overall decrease of viability, causing mental suffering due to impossibility of accomplishing former capabilities (such as the sense of sight, disability of movement), annuity is not a proper form of compensation, since immaterial damage does not emerge periodically, but in a single moment and lasts uninterruptedly...|$|E
