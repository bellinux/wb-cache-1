5|$|Across Iowa they {{followed}} an existing road about 275 miles (443km) to Council Bluffs, following a route that {{is close to}} current U.S. Route 6. After crossing the Missouri River, they paused {{for a few days}} at <b>a</b> <b>Mormon</b> outpost in Florence, Nebraska (now part of Omaha), for repairs, before beginning the remaining 1,030-mile (1,658km) journey along the Mormon Trail to Salt Lake City.|$|E
5|$|At {{their first}} meeting {{following}} his return, Romney and Ann Davies reconnected and decided to get married. Romney began attending Brigham Young University (BYU), {{where she had been}} studying. The couple married on March 21, 1969, in a civil ceremony in Bloomfield Hills. The following day, they flew to Utah for <b>a</b> <b>Mormon</b> wedding ceremony at the Salt Lake Temple; Ann had converted to the faith while he was away.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood then {{branched}} out {{to star in}} the only musical of his career, Paint Your Wagon (1969). Eastwood and Lee Marvin play gold miners who buy <b>a</b> <b>Mormon</b> settler's less favored wife (Jean Seberg) at an auction. Bad weather and delays plagued the production, and the film's budget eventually exceeded $20million, which was extremely expensive for the time. The film was not a critical or commercial success, although it {{was nominated for a}} Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture– Musical or Comedy.|$|E
25|$|An example {{used by some}} to {{illustrate}} the alleged practice of blood atonement is the 1866 murder of the former-slave, Thomas Coleman (or Colburn), who was in good standing {{as a member of}} the LDS Church. <b>As</b> <b>Mormon</b> historian D. Michael Quinn has documented, Coleman was apparently secretly courting <b>a</b> white <b>Mormon</b> woman, contrary to both territorial law and contemporaneous Mormon teachings regarding people of African descent.|$|R

5|$|Raised in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, by {{his parents}} George and Lenore Romney, he spent 2½ years in France as <b>a</b> <b>Mormon</b> missionary, {{starting}} in 1966. He married Ann Davies in 1969, and they have five sons. By 1971, he {{had participated in the}} political campaigns of both parents.

5|$|Nevertheless, {{three out}} of the serial's twelve episodes have been recovered. 16mm copies of episodes 5 and 10 were {{returned}} in the early 1980s, under unclear circumstances (with rumour claiming they {{were found in the}} basement of <b>a</b> <b>Mormon</b> church). Episode 2 was returned in 2004 by former BBC engineer Francis Watson. He had come across the film in the 1970s, while clearing a projector testing room at the BBC's Ealing Studios. Instead of disposing of the film as instructed, he brought it home – eventually to return it to the Corporation when he realised the value of the material.|$|E
5|$|Romney's {{liabilities}} included having run {{for senator}} {{and serving as}} governor {{in one of the}} nation's most liberal states and having taken positions in opposition to the party's conservative base during that time. Late during his term as governor, he had shifted positions and emphases to better align with traditional conservatives on social issues. Skeptics, including some Republicans, charged Romney with opportunism and a lack of core principles. As <b>a</b> <b>Mormon,</b> he faced suspicion and skepticism by some in the Evangelical portion of the party.|$|E

5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for <b>a</b> <b>Mormon</b> woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E
5|$|Dragonlance {{is set on}} {{the world}} of Krynn. The {{majority}} of the novels {{take place in the}} various regions of Ansalon, a small continent, though some have taken place on the continent of Taladas, located northeast of Ansalon. The world's major gods are the High God and his children: good Paladine, neutral Gilean, and evil Takhisis. The gods are opposed by Chaos, who seeks to destroy Krynn. Depending on the time period, the evil chromatic and the good metallic dragons are rare or plentiful. Humans are Krynn's most common humanoid race, but elves, dwarves, kender, gnomes, and minotaurs occupy the world as well. Clerics derive magical powers from their gods, and wizards derive their power from the three moon gods, Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari. Hickman had previously served as <b>a</b> <b>Mormon</b> missionary in Java for two years, and uses Indonesian in Dragonlance spells. During Krynn's various wars, armies of draconians are used as troops. Draconians are created by corrupting a dragon egg, thereby creating a reptilian humanoid. The eggs of good dragons create evil draconians, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Eckhart {{was born}} on March 12, 1968, in Cupertino, California, the son of Mary Martha Eckhart (née Lawrence), a writer, artist, and poet, and James Conrad Eckhart, a {{computer}} executive. He is the youngest of three brothers. His father is of German and Russian descent, while his mother has English, German, Scotch-Irish, and Scottish ancestry. He was raised as <b>a</b> <b>Mormon</b> in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and served a two-year mission in France and Switzerland. Eckhart's family relocated to England in 1981, following his father's job in information technology. The family moved around Surrey, living in towns such as Cobham, Ripley, and Walton-on-Thames. While living in England, Eckhart attended American Community School, where he was first introduced to acting, starring in a school production as Charlie Brown.|$|E

5|$|Estes' {{organization}} {{attracted a}} $3,000 donation from Anita Bryant, and her pastor traveled to Seattle to give advice on Estes' campaign. However, where Estes {{planned to use}} the network of conservative churches in the city, many members were discouraged from working with {{him because he was}} <b>a</b> <b>Mormon.</b> The tone of the advertising for the campaign was more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides in major cities and half the cases of syphilis. Perhaps the most significant factor of the campaign was Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk. Two months before election day, Falk shot and killed a suspect {{who turned out to be}} a black, mentally retarded, young boy. The black community was furious with Falk, and transferred their anger to Initiative Thirteen.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the initial silver rush, a town site was platted {{and the town}} was built. The first permanent business building established in Silver Reef was a store {{at the intersection of}} the roads from the Buckeye, White, and East reefs. By 1878, the town's business district consisted of a hotel, boarding houses, nine stores, six saloons, five restaurants, a bank, two dance halls, a newspaper called The Silver Echo (which later became the Silver Reef Miner), and eight dry goods stores. Two cemeteries, one Catholic and one Protestant, were located south of Silver Reef's business district. Most of the businesses in Silver Reef were situated along a mile-long Main Street. The mining district consisted of 37 mines and five stamp mills: the Christy, Stormont, Leeds, Buckeye and Barbee & Walker mills. Although it was surrounded by settlements with large Mormon populations, the town never had <b>a</b> <b>Mormon</b> meeting house. A Catholic church was the only church located within the town. After the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, many of the Chinese workers who had been hired to build it were out of work. Some returned to China, but others remained in Utah. A group of 250 of these workers set up a Chinatown in a level area just south of Silver Reef. Silver Reef's Chinatown had a Chinese mayor and several businesses. By 1879, Silver Reef's population had reached 2,000, and the town also had a horse race track, a brewery, and a brass band. Shooting matches among members of the Silver Reef Rifle Club and sometimes residents of nearby towns took place on the horse race track.|$|E

25|$|The {{status of}} McCune's {{religious}} beliefs {{is open to}} dispute. Mormon missionary Stuart Martin wrote in 1920 that McCune was not <b>a</b> <b>Mormon,</b> but had many Mormon friends and had given much money to the church. Judge Orlando Powers, Associate Justice of the Utah Supreme Court, said in 1906 that he understood that McCune was not <b>a</b> <b>Mormon.</b> Frank J. Cannon, too, claimed McCune was not a Mormon,and B. H. Roberts, LDS Church historian {{and member of the}} First Council of the Seventy, said in 1930 that McCune was not a church member. Historian Orvin Malmquist, however, says that church records show he was baptized into the LDS Church at the age of eight in 1857, and that his marriage to Elizabeth Claridge in <b>a</b> <b>Mormon</b> temple in 1872 could not have occurred without his being a church member. It is not in dispute that he was baptized by proxy in 1969.|$|E
