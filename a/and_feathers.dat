50|$|IDFL assists {{companies}} in the down <b>and</b> <b>feather</b> industry acquire sterilization permits and meet customer quality expectations by inspecting factories and testing down <b>and</b> <b>feather</b> material. IDFL grades material quality by testing down <b>and</b> <b>feather</b> composition, content analysis, and species type as well as numerous other quality factors. Material is also graded for cleanliness by examining the fat and oil percentages, pH levels, odor, turbidity, and other purity factors. All down <b>and</b> <b>feather</b> material is double tested.|$|R

5|$|The {{poisonous}} pitohuis, {{including the}} hooded pitohui, are not thought {{to create the}} toxic compound themselves but instead sequester them from their diet. Phyllobates frogs kept in captivity do not develop the toxins, {{and the extent of}} the toxicity varies both in the pitohuis across their range and also across the range of the unrelated blue-capped ifrit, another New Guinean bird found with toxic skin <b>and</b> <b>feathers.</b> Both of these facts suggest that the toxins are obtained from the diet. The presence of the toxins in the internal organs as well as the skins <b>and</b> <b>feathers</b> rules out the possibility that the toxins are applied topically from an unknown source by the birds.|$|E

40|$|Beak <b>and</b> <b>Feather</b> Disease Virus (BFDV) is {{a member}} of the genus Circovirus and causes the Psittacine Beak <b>and</b> <b>Feather</b> Disease (PBFD) in Psittaciformes. PBFD is a severe disease {{generally}} characterized by immunodeficiency <b>and</b> beak <b>and</b> <b>feather</b> disorders. Although Circovirus spp. has been detected in several nonpsittacine species, little is known about the symptoms and the disease associated with this infection in birds other than Psittaciformes. In this study, we reported the identification of Circovirus infection in a flock of Gouldian finches showing beak <b>and</b> <b>feather</b> disorders. Sequence analyses on the rep gene of the virus highlighted a strong similarity at nucleotide and amino acid level with the corresponding regions of BFDV from psittacine species.
