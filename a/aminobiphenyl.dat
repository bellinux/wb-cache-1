40|$|The aim to {{this work}} was to develop methods for the {{determination}} of 2 <b>aminobiphenyl</b> (2 -AB), 3 <b>aminobiphenyl</b> (3 -AB), and 4 -aminobiphenyl (4 -AB) in model mixtures. Concretely, the direct determination {{of the mixture of}} studied analytes has been tested using spectrophotometry and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Furthermore, separation and detection of 2 -AB, 3 -AB, and 4 -AB have been performed using high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED) with boron-doped diamond film thin electrode (BDDFE) in,,wall-jet" configuration and using high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection (HPLC-UVD). It was found out that the spectrophotometric determination of 2 -AB, 3 -AB, and 4 -AB is impossible in their mixture because of nearby values of local absorption maxima wavelengths of all three analytes studied. Upon the determination of 2 -AB, 3 -AB, and 4 -AB in their mixture using DPV in BR buffer pH 2. 0, the difference in peak potentials of 2 -AB and 3 -AB is too low for their determination in mixture. Upon the determination of mixture containing 2 -AB and 4 -AB in BR buffer pH 12. 0, the limits of determination (LDs) were obtained in the concentration order of 10 - 6 mol. l- 1 for 2 -AB and 10 - 7 mol. l- 1 for 4 -AB.

40|$|A {{series of}} phosphine-ligated {{palladium}} precatalysts based on N-methyl- and N-phenyl- 2 -aminobiphenyl have been developed. Substitution at the nitrogen center prevents {{the presence of}} traces of <b>aminobiphenyls</b> that contain a free −NH[subscript 2] group from contaminating cross-coupling products. These precatalysts produce N-substituted carbazoles upon activation, which cannot consume starting materials.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{determination}} of selected <b>aminobiphenyls</b> (ABs) and aminonaphthalenes (ANs), proved or suspected carcinogens and mutagens, was developed using reversed-phase HPLC coupled to an amperometric platinum tubular detector and a spectrophotometric detector. Using mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and phosphate buffer pH 2. 5 (40 : 60, v/v), separation of 2 - and 4 -aminobiphenyl and 1 - and 2 -aminonaphthalene was achieved within 10 min and limits of determination between 3 · 10 – 8 mol L– 1 and 8 · 10 – 8 mol L– 1 were obtained for amperometric detection. In comparison with spectrophotometric detection, it is superior in both sensitivity and selectivity. The developed method was applied on the analysis of spiked samples of urine. Solid phase extraction was used for a preliminary separation and preconcentration of the tested analytes, leading to the decrease of limits of determination to the values between 7. 2 · 10 – 9 mol L– 1 and 2. 7 · 10 – 8 mol L– 1...|$|R
40|$|According to International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), some {{specific}} isomers of amino derivatives of {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (APAHs) are classified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1). Several APAHs are employed in the manufacturing of widely-used azodyes, therefore, sensitive and selective analytical methods for their determinations are still needed. This study aims at the possibilities of detection of 2 -aminobiphenyl (2 -AB), 4 -aminobiphenyl (4 -AB), 1 -aminonaphthalene (1 -AN) and 2 -aminonaphthalene (2 -AN) using bare screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE). These were employed as working electrodes in amperometric detection flow cell for repeated use in liquid flow methods - reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and flow injection analysis. Sufficient stability and repeatability was obtained for mobile phases containing the maximum of 70 % of acetonitrile.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report an}} {{observation}} of the light-induced excited spin state trapping effect of Fe 2 + ions using the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique. The experiment was carried out with a Mn 2 +-containing molecular crystal of cis-bis(thiocyanato) -bis[(N- 2 '-pyridylmethylene) - 4 - (<b>aminobiphenyl)</b> ]-iron(II) phase I. First, the photomagnetic properties of the compound were investigated {{in order to determine}} the experimental conditions for a complete low-to-high-spin photoconversion of the Fe 2 + ions. The photoinduced high-spin fraction and the light-induced thermal Hysteresis studies under light irradiation at 830 nm show that a complete spin photoconversion occurs in the temperature range below 40 K. The Mn 2 + EPR spectra recorded at these temperatures clearly show two different patterns corresponding to the low-spin state of Fe 2 + (without light irradiation) and to the metastable high-spin state of this ion (under light irradiation), confirming the complete spin photoconversion. The values of the zero-field splitting parameter D for Mn 2 + in the low-temperature light-induced high-spin structure are determined by computer simulations of the EPR spectra. These values corroborate the temperature dependence of D obtained using the superposition model for the high-spin state of the compound above the thermal hysteresis loop...|$|E
40|$|Current methodologies for the {{detection}} and isolation of carcinogen-DNA adducts have advanced beyond {{the capabilities of the}} methods used to elucidate their structures. This difficulty seriously limits the potential use of DNA-carcinogen adducts in human dosimetry. We have investigated two general strategies for the analysis of model arylamine-nucleoside adducts using desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MS). Using fast atom bombardment MS-MS with constant neutral loss scans, we can identify the protonated molecule of derivatized adducts in samples as small as 1 pmole, and then apply daughter ion MS-MS scans to obtain structure-specific fragmentation. Using this strategy we have differentiated adducts having the same carcinogen and different bases [e. g., N-(deoxyadenosin- 8 -yl) - 4 -aminobiphenyl and N-(deoxyguanosin- 8 -yl) - 4 - aminobiphenyl] or the same base and different carcinogens [e. g., N-(deoxyguanosin- 8 -yl) - 4 - <b>aminobiphenyl</b> and N-(deoxyguanosin- 8 -yl) - 2 -aminofluorene]. In the second approach we used laser desorption time-of-flight MS to obtain spectra from adduct samples as small as 20 fmole. These data indicate that MS can be used for the analysis of very low (picomole-femtomole) levels of nucleoside adducts, including isomers, and that desorption ionization MS and MS-MS have significant potential for applications in human dosimetry...|$|E
40|$|Of {{the three}} {{isomeric}} forms of <b>aminobiphenyl,</b> only 4 -aminobiphenyl is an established carcinogen while the 2 -isomer is {{considered as a}} non-carcinogen and 3 -aminobiphenyl is at best described as a weak carcinogen. In the present studies we investigated the mutagenicity of these three compounds, their N-hydroxy derivatives and their nitrosoderivatives in the Ames test using the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98 and TA 100. The studies were performed both in the absence and presence of an activation system derived from the liver of rats pretreated with Aroclor 1254. Of the three isomers only 4 -aminobiphenyl exhibited mutagenicity and only {{in the presence of}} an activation system. N-Hydroxy- 4 -aminobiphenyl was a potent direct mutagen in both bacterial strains, N-hydroxy- 2 -aminobiphenyl was mutagenic in only TA 100 while N-hydroxy- 3 -aminobiphenyl displayed mutagenicity in neither strain. Both 2 - and 3 -nitrosobiphenyls were direct mutagens in strain TA 100. These findings suggest that the weak carcinogenicity of 3 -aminobiphenyl may be attributed to the lack of genotoxicity of its N-hydroxyderivative, whereas in the case of 2 -aminobiphenyl it {{may be due to the}} inability of the hepatic preparations to catalyse its N-hydroxylation, which is in agreement with published in vivo metabolic studies. It is interesting that of the three isomers only 2 -aminobiphenyl is non-planar, forming a dihedral angle of 40 degrees, and this may preclude it from acting as a substrate of the P- 450 I family of haemoproteins, which selectively catalyses the N-hydroxylation of many aromatic amines including 4 -aminobiphenyl...|$|E
40|$|Roughly {{one-half}} of bladder cancer incidence in the United States {{can be attributed}} to known causes, mainly cigarette smoking, and it has been hypothesized that the aromatic amines in tobacco smoke are important etiological agents. Nonsmokers are also exposed, through unknown sources, to many of the same carcinogenic aromatic amines that are present in cigarette smoke. Previous epidemiological studies have not tested whether either of these aromatic amine exposures are associated with cancer risk. We conducted a population-based case-control study in Los Angeles County, California, involving 761 case patients with bladder cancer and 770 individually matched control subjects. In-person interviews provided information on tobacco smoking and other potential risk factors. Quantitative analysis of hemoglobin adducts of 4 - and 3 -aminobiphenyl (ABP) was used to assess aromatic amine exposure. Adducts of both <b>aminobiphenyls</b> were significantly higher in cases than in controls, independent of cigarette smoking at the time of blood collection and lifetime smoking history. Adjustment for other risk factors as well as for metabolic differences did not materially alter the associations. Our findings strengthen the connection between exposure to aromatic amines in tobacco smoke and cigarette smoking-related bladder cancer and suggest that environmental exposure to arylamines may account for a significant proportion of nonsmoking-related bladder cancer in the general population...|$|R
40|$|Certain {{aromatic}} amines carcinogenic {{for the human}} urinary bladder, such as 4 -aminobiphenyl, undergo hepatic metabolic activation to N-hydroxylamines, which are transported to the bladder. During the transport process, these reactive species {{come in contact with}} hemoglobin and react with this blood protein. The principal hemoglobin adduct formed is a cysteine sulfinamide, and quantitative methods have been developed for the analysis of sulfinamide adducts at the levels present in ordinary human blood specimens. /N-acetylation is an alternative metabolic fate to N-hydroxylation. The amount of hemoglobin adduct is decreased to the extent that this pathway is increased relative to N-hydroxylation. Thus, the hemoglobin adduct is sensitive to dose, cytochrome P 450 -mediated activation, and N-acetyltransferase-mediated detoxification. In addition, {{it has been shown that}} DNA adduct concentration of 4 -aminobiphenyl present in human bladder epithelial cells is significantly associated with hemoglobin adduct levels. Thus, the hemoglobin adduct of 4 -aminobiphenyl, and perhaps several other {{aromatic amines}}, is a good dosimeter for the target tissue dose of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of these amines. Several studies have been undertaken in which the hemoglobin adducts of <b>aminobiphenyls</b> in human blood specimens were determined quantitatively. Information concerning exposure status and acetylator phenotype of the same individuals was obtained simultaneously. The results of these studies indicate that the hemoglobin adduct of 4 -aminobiphenyl is closely associated with three major risk factors for bladder cancer: cigarette smoking, type of tobacco smoked, and acetylator phenotype. They also support a major etiologic role for aromatic amines in much of human bladder cancer. - Environ Health Perspect 102 (Suppl 6) : 17 - 21 (1994) Key words: hemoglobin adducts, aromatic amines, bladder cancer, 4 -aminobiphenyl, cigarette smokin...|$|R
40|$|Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT 1) and 2 (NAT 2) {{catalyze}} the detoxification and/or {{activation of}} aromatic and heterocyclic amine carcinogens by two pathways. This metabolism reaction {{can lead to}} the detoxification by Nacetylation, or bioactivation by a-acetylation often preceded by CYP 450 hydroxylation. Human NAT 2 polymorphisms are characterized by rapid, intermediate, and slow acetylator phenotypes, thus resulting in differences in the rate of arylamine metabolism and consequently cancer risk. We have constructed nucleotide excision repair-deficient human cell model expressing human CYP 1 A 2 and human NAT 1 and NAT 2 in order to investigate carcinogen metabolism and cancer susceptibility in human cells. In this study we introduce the utilization of SV 40 -transformed human fibroblasts (GM 4429) to examine the functional effects of human NAT 2 haplotypes, in the presence of human NAT 1. Many carcinogens, such as 4 - <b>aminobiphenyl,</b> are metabolized by both NAT 1 and NAT 2, consequently both isozymes have toxicologically significant functions in the metabolism of arylamines. Furthermore, both NAT 1 and NAT 2 isozymes are expressed in human liver, where they are significant to carcinogen detoxification and/or activation consequences. With this model, we can examine the role of NAT 1 and NAT 2 carcinogen metabolism and genotoxicity in a NER-deficient human cell. In this study, we investigate novel inhibitors of NAT 1 and NAT 2. Previous studies have identified approximately 150 NAT inhibitor candidates following computer-based in silico screening of approximately 20 million compounds. The inhibitory properties of these compounds were tested using a High Performance Liquid Chromatography assay specific for human NAT 1 and NAT 2. A novel compound was identified that is an effective inhibitor of NAT 1 (100 %) and NAT 2 (90 %). This inhibitor was selective for NAT 1 (IC 50 about 1 µM), compared to an IC 50 of 82. 2 µM (SMZ) for NAT 2. Further studies will determine potency and efficacy of NAT inhibitors to reduce DNA adduct formation and mutagenesis. We have also successfully constructed and characterized NER-deficient human fibroblast cells with stable expression of human NAT 2 alleles (NAT 2 * 4, NAT 2 *S 8, or NAT 2 * 78) and CYP 1 A 2. These models are used to better understand the effects of NAT 2 haplotypes on carcinogen metabolism and DNA adduct formation in human cells...|$|E
40|$|CORESTA joint {{experiment}} work in 2006 had compared {{data on a}} {{wide range}} of smoke constituents obtained from Kentucky reference cigarettes (1 R 5 F and 2 R 4 F), according to the existing methods used by participants. This work had identified that the methods used to determine aromatic amine yields in mainstream smoke would particularly benefit from further study to investigate the main weaknesses and influencing factors in their yield variability before progressing to full method standardisation. This report describes the output from a 2007 joint experiment to address these issues. Participating laboratories carried out experiments to investigate several factors that had been identified in the methodology as potential sources of variability. These were the amine derivative type, the derivatisation time and the point at which the addition of the internal standard for calibration occurred. A statistical assessment was made of their possible influence on aromatic amine smoke yields and yield reproducibility across different laboratories. Results showed that aromatic amines again had poor between-laboratory yield reproducibility. The stage at which the internal standard was added to the smoke sample had the most significant effect on yields. The least variable data were obtained when it was added directly after extraction from the filter pad rather than later in the process. It also appeared beneficial to use at least two calibration standards (i. e., an aminonaphthalene and an <b>aminobiphenyl)</b> to minimise yield differences although this recommendation was not supported by statistically significant data. Large differences in yields were not found when comparing the two studied derivatising agents especially when compared against the greater overall between-laboratory variability. Any differences between laboratories in total particulate matter and puff count at the smoke collection stage did not appear to significantly contribute to betweenlaboratory differences in yields. It appeared that some laboratories had significantly improved their methodology since the last study although high values for the between-laboratory reproducibility in this study were still found. It may be that significant improvements in reproducibility may not be forthcoming for compounds such as the aromatic amines measured at low nanogram smoke yields. Some important features that need to be controlled to minimise variability were identified in this study and will be incorporated within a collaborative study leading to a recommended method. Also, a wider range of product styles will need to be investigated, to determine the effects of differences in tobacco blends and product styles and the potential of greater product variability of commercial products. This should provide more robust estimates of within-laboratory repeatability and between-laboratory reproducibility...|$|E
