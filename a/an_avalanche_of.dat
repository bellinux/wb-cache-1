5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the photocathode initiates <b>an</b> <b>avalanche</b> <b>of</b> electrons that produces a detectable current pulse. Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they {{played a critical role}} in the development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state devices such as the transistor.|$|E
5|$|The {{magazine}} Paris Flash {{claim that}} Haddock and Castafiore are engaged, {{on the basis}} of a misinterpreted interview with Professor Calculus. This results in <b>an</b> <b>avalanche</b> <b>of</b> congratulations from Haddock's friends. A television crew come to Marlinspike Hall to interview Castafiore and a mysterious photographer, Gino, appears with the crew. Suddenly, Irma informs Castafiore that her jewels have been stolen, and Tintin suspects Gino who runs away during a temporary power cut. Castafiore, however, finds the jewel-case she herself had misplaced. The next day, Castafiore shows Tintin and Haddock a copy of the magazine Tempo di Roma with a picture of Castafiore taken at Marlinspike Hall without her permission, proving that Gino was only a magazine reporter.|$|E
5|$|While Wally goes to {{a funeral}} home to attend {{the wake of a}} former estate client, the client's son claims that his father was killed by Krayoxx, a {{cholesterol-lowering}} drug developed by the (fictional) pharmaceutical company Varrick Labs. Ecstatic at the possible monetary returns on the case, the firm finds several former clients who appear to have valid claims about Krayoxx. Oscar and Wally generate publicity in the Chicago Tribune with a picture of their filing; this induces <b>an</b> <b>avalanche</b> <b>of</b> communications and leads them to several additional claimants. However, Wally and his fellows are far out of their depth. None of the three Finley & Figg lawyers has ever argued in a United States federal court, and they have only a vague idea of what is involved in confronting a major corporation which is able to hire the best legal talent around - which turns out to be Zinc's old firm.|$|E

5|$|In The Curse of Monkey Island, with Guybrush indisposed {{at the end}} of LeChuck's Revenge, LeChuck attacks Plunder Island, {{the third}} island covered by Elaine's gubernatorial powers. LeChuck's efforts to buy Elaine's love are again rebuked by Elaine during an {{exchange}} of cannon fire; Elaine is angry at LeChuck for having apparently killed Guybrush, who she realises is the true love of her life. The battle is interrupted by Guybrush, who has escaped from LeChuck's curse and helps defeat the zombie pirate. Afterwards, Guybrush proposes to Elaine, giving her a diamond ring found in LeChuck's hold. Unknown to Guybrush, the ring is cursed and turns Elaine into solid gold. Guybrush manages to remove the curse, but both are captured by a reincarnated demon LeChuck. LeChuck plans to turn Elaine into a fellow undead creature, forcing her to accept him as he will be the only other person in a similar condition. Both Elaine and Guybrush escape, with Elaine eluding LeChuck until he is trapped under <b>an</b> <b>avalanche</b> <b>of</b> ice by Guybrush. Elaine and Guybrush marry, and leave on their honeymoon.|$|E

2500|$|Over 100 {{expeditions to}} the region were held since the incident, {{and none of them}} ever {{reported}} conditions that might create <b>an</b> <b>avalanche.</b> <b>A</b> study <b>of</b> the area using up-to-date terrain-related physics revealed that the location was entirely unlikely for such <b>an</b> <b>avalanche</b> to have occurred.

25|$|The {{location}} of the incident {{did not have any}} obvious signs of an avalanche having taken place. An avalanche would have left certain patterns and debris distributed over a wide area. The bodies found within ten days of the event were covered with a very shallow layer of snow and, had there been <b>an</b> <b>avalanche</b> <b>of</b> sufficient strength to sweep away the second party, these bodies would have been swept away as well; this would have caused more serious and different injuries in the process and would have damaged the tree line.|$|E
25|$|A glacial lake {{outburst}} flood (GLOF) {{is a type}} of outburst flood {{that occurs}} when the dam containing a glacial lake fails. An event similar to a GLOF, where a body of water contained by a glacier melts or overflows the glacier, is called a Jökulhlaup. The dam can consist of glacier ice or a terminal moraine. Failure can happen due to erosion, a buildup of water pressure, <b>an</b> <b>avalanche</b> <b>of</b> rock or heavy snow, an earthquake or cryoseism, volcanic eruptions under the ice, or if a large enough portion of a glacier breaks off and massively displaces the waters in a glacial lake at its base.|$|E

25|$|The {{sequence}} of the Paths of the Dead adds a conversation between Aragorn and the King of the Dead (in the book the Dead don't speak at all) and a scene where the companions must flee <b>an</b> <b>avalanche</b> <b>of</b> skulls, but leaves out the encounter with Baldor's skeleton. In contrast to the book, the viewer doesn't get told what happened in Lebennin between Aragorn and the Corsairs of Umbar. The film version (Extended Edition) doesn't correspond with the map of Gondor, as the company sees a near river with Corsair ships immediately after leaving the Haunted Mountain. In the book, the River Anduin lies several hundred miles farther east, requiring a much longer journey with the Army of the Dead following behind, bringing terror to the towns they pass along the way.|$|E
25|$|In 1865, Whymper, {{weary of}} the defeats he had {{sustained}} on the south-west ridge, tried a new way. The stratification of the rocks on the east face seemed to him favourable, and the slope not excessive. His plan of attack was complicated: a huge rock couloir, the base of which lies on the Italian side below the Breuiljoch, on the little Matterhorn glacier, would be ascended to a point {{high up on the}} Furggen ridge; from there, traversing the east face of the mountain, he meant to reach the Hörnli (north-east) ridge and follow it to the summit. However, when this route was attempted, the mountain discharged <b>an</b> <b>avalanche</b> <b>of</b> stone upon the climbers, and the ascent failed. His guides refused to make any further attempts by this route.|$|E
25|$|Cathode strip {{chambers}} (CSC) {{are used}} in the endcap disks where the magnetic field is uneven and particle rates are high. CSCs consist of arrays of positively charged “anode” wires crossed with negatively charged copper “cathode” strips within a gas volume. When muons pass through, they knock electrons off the gas atoms, which flock to the anode wires creating <b>an</b> <b>avalanche</b> <b>of</b> electrons. Positive ions move away from the wire and towards the copper cathode, also inducing a charge pulse in the strips, at right angles to the wire direction. Because the strips and the wires are perpendicular, we get two position coordinates for each passing particle. In addition to providing precise space and time information, the closely spaced wires make the CSCs fast detectors suitable for triggering. Each CSC module contains six layers making it able to accurately identify muons and match their tracks to those in the tracker.|$|E

25|$|In 1877, Standard {{clashed with}} Thomas A. Scott the {{president}} of the Pennsylvania Railroad, its chief hauler. Flagler and Rockefeller had envisioned the use of pipelines as an alternative transport system for oil and began a campaign to build and acquire them. The railroad, seeing Standard’s incursion into the transportation and pipeline fields, struck back and formed a subsidiary to buy and build oil refineries and pipelines. Standard countered and held back its shipments and, with the help of other railroads, started a price war that dramatically reduced freight payments and caused labor unrest as well. Flagler and Rockefeller eventually prevailed and the railroad sold all its oil interests to Standard. But in the aftermath of that battle, in 1879 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania indicted Flagler and Rockefeller on charges of monopolizing the oil trade, starting <b>an</b> <b>avalanche</b> <b>of</b> similar court proceedings in other states and making a national issue of Standard Oil’s business practices.|$|E
25|$|Resistive plate {{chambers}} (RPC) {{are fast}} gaseous detectors {{that provide a}} muon trigger system parallel {{with those of the}} DTs and CSCs. RPCs consist of two parallel plates, a positively charged anode and a negatively charged cathode, both made of a very high resistivity plastic material and separated by a gas volume. When a muon passes through the chamber, electrons are knocked out of gas atoms. These electrons in turn hit other atoms causing <b>an</b> <b>avalanche</b> <b>of</b> electrons. The electrodes are transparent to the signal (the electrons), which are instead picked up by external metallic strips after a small but precise time delay. The pattern of hit strips gives a quick measure of the muon momentum, which is then used by the trigger to make immediate decisions about whether the data are worth keeping. RPCs combine a good spatial resolution with a time resolution of just one nanosecond (one billionth of a second).|$|E
25|$|In 1975, {{in one of}} {{the most}} memorable grand finals ever, the Arthur Beetson captained, Jack Gibson coached Eastern Suburbs Roosters, {{defeated}} St. George 38–0 to win the premiership. That Roosters team is considered one of the best sides ever assembled and the eight tries to nil scoreline remained a record winning margin in a grand final until the 2008 NRL Grand Final played between Manly Warringah and the Melbourne Storm, Manly winning by the tune of 40–0. However, the game was famous for reasons other than the scoreline. St George's Captain-coach Graeme Langlands played with a misdirected pain killing injection that made his right leg go numb and prevented him from playing anywhere near his best. Easts were without two of their stars, rookie fullback Russell Fairfax and centre Mark Harris, and coach Jack Gibson gambled on an unknown player to help fill the void – John Rheinberger – who played in his first only first grade game in the Grand Final. Leading by only 5–0 at half-time, the Roosters scored <b>an</b> <b>avalanche</b> <b>of</b> tries after the interval to humiliate the Dragons. Earlier in the same season, the Roosters recorded the longest winning streak of any first grade rugby league football club – 19 matches. It was the Eastern Suburbs Roosters' eleventh premiership victory and their second in succession.|$|E
