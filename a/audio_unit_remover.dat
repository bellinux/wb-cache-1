40|$|A mobile <b>audio</b> <b>unit</b> is a wireless, battery-driven unit, {{the main}} purpose of which is to {{reproduce}} acoustic signals. This kind of unit can be used in conjunction with a home server. For example, a radio station broadcasting can be received from the Internet and fed to the mobile <b>audio</b> <b>unit</b> via a central home server. The market for home servers is expected to grow leading to a possible expansion of the market for this type of mobile <b>audio</b> <b>unit.</b> This paper presents some design aspects for the sound system of an <b>audio</b> <b>unit,</b> adapted to the new demands of the market...|$|R

50|$|<b>Audio</b> <b>Units</b> (AU) are a {{system-level}} plug-in architecture {{provided by}} Core Audio in Apple's macOS and iOS operating systems. <b>Audio</b> <b>Units</b> are {{a set of}} application programming interface (API) services provided by the operating system to generate, process, receive, or otherwise manipulate streams of audio in near-real-time with minimal latency. It may {{be thought of as}} Apple's architectural equivalent to another popular plug-in format, Steinberg's Virtual Studio Technology (VST). Because of the many similarities between <b>Audio</b> <b>Units</b> and VST, several commercial and free wrapping technologies are available (e.g. Symbiosis and FXpansion VST-AU Adapter).|$|R

50|$|SynthMaster is a semi-modular {{software}} synthesizer {{and effect}} plug-in in VST, <b>Audio</b> <b>Units</b> and RTAS formats, developed by KV331 Audio.|$|R
50|$|GarageBand {{can also}} use any {{third-party}} software synthesizer that adheres to the Core <b>Audio</b> (<b>Audio</b> <b>Units)</b> standard. However, there are limitations, including that <b>Audio</b> <b>Unit</b> instruments which can respond to multiple MIDI channels or ports can be triggered only on the first channel of the first port. This means that multi-timbral instruments which contain multiple channels and respond to many MIDI channels, such as Native Instruments Kontakt and MOTU MachFive, are not ideally suited for use in GarageBand.|$|R
5000|$|The 1999 two-piece <b>audio</b> <b>unit</b> {{consisting}} of a radio with tape deck and a separate single-CD player was upgraded to a larger, single-face, 6-disc unit in 2001.|$|R

50|$|The VST plugin {{standard}} {{is the audio}} plugin standard created by Steinberg to allow any third party developers to create VST plugins for use within VST host applications. VST requires separate installations for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The majority of VST plugins are available for Windows only due to Apple's competing proprietary <b>Audio</b> <b>Unit</b> technology being used on OS X (<b>Audio</b> <b>Units</b> is a core part of the OS X operating system). The lack of a commercial environment for Linux means few developers target this platform.|$|R

The facilities enable complete hearing conservation programs {{to be created}} for businesses with work environments that have high noise levels. These businesses are {{required by law to}} protect and conserve their employees' ability to hear. In the US, employers must provide preventative measures and protection for employees who experience 85 dB or more, over an 8-hour time weighted average. [...] The <b>audio</b> <b>units</b> also contain fit test equipment so that employees who wear respirators (such as dust masks and supplied air masks) are tested to see whether they are physiologically capable of using the equipment without injury and that the equipment properly fits. There are strict health and safety standards and regulations surrounding the occupational use of Personal Protective Equipment at work including respirators.|$|R

5000|$|Other than pitch bend, GarageBand {{is limited}} to the pitches and {{intervals}} of standard 12-tone equal temperament, so it does not natively support xenharmonic music. Logic Pro supports many different tunings. GarageBand does not support different tunings however, <b>audio</b> <b>units</b> which support micro tuning (using [...]scl or [...]tun files, or some other method) can be employed in GarageBand to produce alternative pitches.|$|R
