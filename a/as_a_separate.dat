5|$|Moroccan {{collections}} {{under the}} cork oak (Quercus suber) that were initially regarded as B.aereus were described <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> species—Boletus mamorensis—in 1978, {{on the basis}} of a rufous chestnut cap and a rooting stipe, or stem, with a reticulation often limited to the top (apex). In 2010 however, molecular phylogenetic studies by Bryn Dentinger and colleagues placed these collections close to B.aereus, likely suggesting an ecological variant or subspecies rather than a distinct species. American mycologist Harry Thiers reported Boletus aereus from California in 1975; however, a taxonomic revision of western North American porcini boletes in 2008 formally established them <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> species, Boletus regineus. These differ from B.aereus by nature of their more gelatinous cap skin (pileipellis), and belong in a different porcini lineage.|$|E
