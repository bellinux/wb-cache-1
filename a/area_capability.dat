30|$|Maturity is in {{the context}} of {{maturity}} modelling understood as a “measure to evaluate the capabilities of an organisation” (Rosemann and Bruin 2005 : 1). CMMs allow for the assessment of maturity of a variety of different items, e.g. technologies and/or systems (e.g. Popovic et al. 2009), processes (e.g. Rosemann and Bruin 2005) or skills (e.g. Curtis et al. 2010). If many items are considered to be relevant that somehow belong together or that can be attributed to a particular worldview, they are grouped into <b>capability</b> <b>areas</b> and ultimately into “factors” (Rosemann and Bruin 2005; Rosemann and Brocke 2010). For instance, capabilities that relate to hard and soft skills of employees can be labelled as people <b>capability</b> <b>area</b> (see Sect. 3.1). It is important to notice that, although maturity models with only one <b>capability</b> <b>area</b> exist, it has become a common practice today to use a cumulative set of different <b>capability</b> <b>areas</b> (van Steenbergen 2011 : 114). If the number of relevant items is not too high, it might be sufficient to differentiate two granularity layers (items/capabilities vs. <b>capability</b> <b>areas)</b> instead of three (items, <b>capability</b> <b>areas</b> and factors).|$|R

Practically useful values of epsilon similar to 1000, tan delta similar to 0. 03, and tunability similar to 50 % have been obtained in the low gigahertz range (1 - 5 GHz). Peaks in the dielectric loss due to acoustic resonance have been modeled and tentatively identified as due to an electrostrictive effect with an electromechanical coupling coefficient of similar to 0. 04 at an electric field of 240 kV/cm which is potentially useful for tunable thin film bulk acoustic wave devices...|$|E

However, {{it is still}} far from use in routine production because of problems {{such as the ability}} to control the ion depth profile in targets, the ion dose and contamination. In this thesis, a PIII system has been systematically calibrated, and a computer simulation code for PIII has been developed in order to understand more clearly the physics of the PIII process and to optimise the experimental conditions. In the second part of this thesis, a new application of PIII has been explored, where the PIII technique {{has been used as a}} high dose-rate implant treatment to form amorphous silicon nitride/oxide films on both crystalline and amorphous silicon substrates. The electrical properties of these films have been characterized. It shows that low dose nitrogen/oxygen implantation leads to the modification of Schottky barrier heights or the introduction of charged defects in the materials. As the ion dose is increased, alloying effects take over, forming silicon nitride/oxide alloys. The a-SiNx:H films synthesized via PIII have electrical characteristics similar to those grown by PECVD, but a-SiOx:H has different electrical properties from a-SiNx:H...|$|E

40|$|The {{last ten}} or fifteen years have seen a quiet {{revolution}} in criminology and criminal justice. There has been a vast improvement in {{the quality and quantity}} of data, and in the availability of that data to decisionmakers. Sufficient information is now available so that basic indicators related to criminal justice issues can be measured with a degree of precision that was not only unknown a few years ago, but was even unanticipated. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we are not plagued by a dearth of information in criminal justice (Block, 1989). The problem is just the opposite. There are often so many pieces of information that it is impossible for the human mind to assimilate them, to sort them out, and to use them for tactical or crime analysis decisions before the window of opportunity has passed. Even more recently, another revolution has not only precipitated a surge in the amount of information available, but also enlarged the nature of that information to include two-dimensional space. This technological revolution, computer mapping, has generated a need for analytical methods and techniques to make spatial information a foundation for answering practical and policy questions.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of nanoscience and nanotechnology {{in the last}} two decades was stimulated by the emergence of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques capable of accessing local material properties, including transport, mechanical, and electromechanical behavior on the nanoscale. Here, we analyze the general principles of electromechanical probing by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), a scanning probe technique applicable to a broad range of piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials. The physics of image formation in PFM is compared to Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy in terms of the tensorial nature of excitation and the detection signals and signal dependence on the tip-surface contact area. It is shown that its insensitivity to contact <b>area,</b> <b>capability</b> for vector detection, and strong orientational dependence render this technique a distinct class of SPM. The relationship between vertical and lateral PFM signals and material properties are derived analytically for two cases: transversally-isotropic piezoelectric materials in the limit of weak elastic anisotropy, and anisotropic piezoelectric materials in the limit of weak elastic and dielectric anisotropies. The integral representations for PFM response for fully anisotropic material are also obtained. The image formation mechanism for conventional (e. g., sphere and cone) and multipole tips corresponding to emerging shielded and strip-line type probes are analyzed. Resolution limits in PFM and possible applications for orientation imaging on the nanoscale and molecular resolution imaging are discussed.

30|$|Some {{cells of}} the CMM are empty owing {{to the fact that}} on “each {{maturity}} level certain components of [the object of maturity] become evident and others barely registered” (McCormack et al. 2009 : 795). This is common practice in maturity model construction, as not every evolutionary step needs to cover each and every <b>capability</b> <b>area</b> (Ahern et al. 2003). In the case of the herein proposed model it becomes evident that a full implementation of process management in Swiss hospitals begins with ‘setting the scene’ by laying a focus on the rather soft <b>capability</b> <b>areas</b> culture and strategy in stages 1 and 2. From there on, the focus shifts to the more tangible implementation-related <b>capability</b> <b>areas</b> structure, work practices and IT.

Therefore, the capabilities of organisations in managing disasters need to be improved, and there should be a way of assessing these capabilities. Hence, this study used capability maturity model (CMM) methodology to develop an assessment method that identifies the built environment flood resilience capabilities of micro, small and medium-sized businesses (MSMEs). Towards achieving the aim of the study, a conceptual model was developed using the <b>capability</b> <b>areas</b> identified from the literature. The model was then verified and refined by an expert forum. The conceptual model was further improved in case studies, applied in case organisations and after that validated; this resulted in the final model. This study identified 19 <b>capability</b> <b>areas</b> for enhancing built environment flood resilience and developed a capability maturity model that contains maturity level definitions ranging from level 1 (Ad hoc) to level 5 (Optimising). The outcome of this study provides both theoretical and practical contributions to knowledge.

The <b>capability</b> <b>areas</b> can be adopted for use in subsequent studies. Also, the application of capability maturity modelling (CMM) in disaster resilience of the built environment is novel, this has expanded the boundary of CMM application. The practical contributions of the study include the identified <b>capability</b> <b>areas,</b> the <b>capability</b> level definitions and the capability maturity model for profiling MSMEs and benchmarking the capabilities of businesses for built environment flood resilience.

In other words: {{in order to reach}} a certain level in a staged CMM, it is compulsory to comply with all requirements in all <b>capability</b> <b>areas</b> of that level. In a continuous CMM, intermediate maturity levels (which can be defined “between” two basic maturity levels) can be reached by reaching only a subset of requirements.
