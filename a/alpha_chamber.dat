50|$|The second {{suite of}} three {{chambers}} (referred to as Alpha, Beta and Gamma) {{are believed to}} be used for the burial of Meketaten, Akhenaten's second daughter. Two of the chambers (Alpha and Gamma) are decorated and depict very similar scenes: in the <b>Alpha</b> <b>chamber</b> Akhenaten and Nefertiti bend over the inert body of a woman, weeping and gripping each other's arms for support. Nearby a nurse stands with a baby in her arms, accompanied by a fan-bearer, which indicates the baby's royal status. The names in the scene have been hacked out. In the Gamma chamber a very similar scene is shown; here the hieroglyphs identify the dead young woman as Meketaten. In the same chamber another scene shows Meketaten standing under a canopy which is usually associated with childbirth but can also interpreted as representing the rebirth of the princess. In front of her, amongst courtiers, stand Akhenaten, Nefertiti and their three remaining daughters, Meritaten, Ankhesenpaaten and Neferneferuaten Tasherit. The presence of a royal baby causes many to believe the young princess died in childbirth (in this case the father is most likely to have been Akhenaten himself, marrying his daughter), but it cannot be proven.|$|E

40|$|Prospectus` of Band Pass Amplifiers for Proportional Counters and Instrumentation for the Study of the Electrodeposition Potential of Radioactive Elements {{have been}} {{submitted}} for review and approval. An error was found in calculations for the band pass amplifier discussed in Group 9 of the Electronics Progress Report,MLM- 306, March 1 [...] 31, 1949, on the Cathode-Follower Probe. New calculations have been made and a band pass filter constructed to match the new values. Work on the cathode-follower circuit for coupling a Boron-wall tube to its linear amplifier indicated that the limit to the sharpness of a pulse which could be achieved was possibly caused by poor amplitude versus frequency response of the linear amplifier. To check this theory, modifications were made on an existing scaler {{which resulted in a}} frequency response flat up to 4. 5 megacycles. Plans are being made to improve the amplitude versus frequency of the higher frequencies. The response curve shows a slightly rising characteristic at 4. 5 megacycles and an attenuation at 7 megacycles. Construction of the rf generator has been resumed in an effort to deliver the finished product to Group 4 by approximately May 6, 1949. The meter circuit will measure relative rf output voltage instead of absolute voltage.

50|$|The events {{surrounding}} Vector Prime’s return to Cybertron were chronicled in the Transformers: Cybertron animated series, {{and he would}} subsequently travel to Earth with Optimus Prime’s Autobot force {{to search for the}} Cyber Planet Keys that would restore Primus’s lost power and enable him to seal the black hole. Early on in this quest, Vector Prime briefly returned to Cybertron to update the ancient Autobot Alpha Trion on their progress. During this visit, however, they were attacked by Ramjet and Nemesis Prime, heralds of Unicron who sought to orchestrate their master’s rebirth by destroying Primus. Vector Prime engaged Ramjet, but was unable to prevent Alpha Trion and the mega-computer Vector Sigma from being damaged. While Sentinel Maximus battled Nemesis Prime in the planet's depth, Vector Prime and Ramjet duelled in the skies above the planet; Vector Prime was able to claim victory despite some interference from the Velocitronian Transformer Skyfall. With the heralds' plan foiled, Vector Prime took Skyfall to <b>Alpha</b> Trion's <b>chamber</b> for repairs, and then (apparently inadvertently) returned to rejoin Optimus Prime’s forces on Earth.|$|R

A multichannel instrument for automated in situ measurements of interior and exterior contamination has been developed which incorporates a rotary table, 13 fixed ion-implanted silicon detectors, and spectroscopy electronics. Custom software was written to allow alpha spectrometer to function as a virtual instrument in the LabView environment. This system gives improved speed and resolution as well as a complete log of the location of areas of high surface contamination, a feature not practical to obtain by other methods, and one which opens the possibility of long term studies such as Pu outgrowth evaluation employing the instrument.

40|$|Electret-based passive air {{samplers}} {{have been}} used in United Kingdom and elsewhere for quantitative sampling for airborne dust. <b>Alpha</b> electret ion <b>chambers</b> (EIC) {{have been used}} for quantitative measurement of deposited alpha emitting isotopes. These two well documented principles are combined to create a passive radon progeny monitor. Large area (50 cm 2) electret charged to 500 to 2000 volts collect airborne radon decay products and the collected sample is "viewed " and measured by an alpha EIC. Such collection and measurement continues for the entire period of sampling, providing an integrated signal to the electret in alpha EIC. The present work is of exploratory nature and provides the responses of three different sizes of collection electrets. Results are also compared with a simple passive device with no collecting electret. The study provides data for optimization of the design depending upon the requirement. Study is limited to a typical home with equilibrium ratios from 40 to 60 %. This method can be used for both short term and long term monitoring of RDP in working level units...|$|R
40|$|Radon {{has long}} been 			recognized {{as one of the}} indoor air problems. There is a strong 			relation between radon and lung cancer.

40|$|A special {{detection}} chamber with vacuum system, thoron {{source and}} silicon surface barrier detector {{was designed and}} used for measurement of 216 Po ions using electrostatic collection and <b>alpha</b> spectroscopy. The <b>chamber</b> {{was found to be}} useful in providing simple geometrical conditions with homogenous electric collection field. The vacuum system made it possible to fill the chamber with various gases and set the required pressures. Basic alpha spectral response of the detector with respect to thoron and its daughters was investigated by means of a standard multichannel analyser system. General components of the spectra were identified and described. The contribution of ThC, ThCand of actionon daughters to the spectra was determined. A theoretical formula for expected saturation curve of collection of ThA alpha activity in bias range of - 3000 V was derived. Based on simplified assumption the formula acceptably describes the collection process. Series of alpha spectra were taken in various gases with bias applied in the range of 0 - 3000 V. Saturation curves were recorded for the thA activity collection over the range of the applied bias. The following characteristic were derived for each gaseous atmosphere from the measured data: The effective mobility Eeff as obtained by fitting the experimental saturation values in the region from 0 V up to 100 V with the formula 4. 2. The linear mobility Elin was calculated from the measurement at 10 V bias when assuming a linear dependance of the mobility on the applied bias in low electric field region and in the early stage of cluster formation. The effective diffusivity coefficient was obtained as the ratio of the ThA activity "plate-outed" on the detector and the volume distributed activity of the ThA and Tn measured at zero field applied. These three parameters exhibit a relatively significant correlation when compared among the four measured gases. This demostrates that mobility and diffusivity are affected in the same way by clustering. this is in agreement with the generally accepted concepts and published results. The present results can be used when designing an electrostatic collection chamber for radon and thoron detection.
