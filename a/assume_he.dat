5|$|That night, Leslie and Tom don {{black and}} watch the pit from a van. Leslie {{eventually}} spots Ann and Mark leaving for their date, and starts snapping photos of them. Later, Leslie and Tom see Ann's ex-boyfriend Andy (Chris Pratt) in the pit. They <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> is the kingpin, but he insists he is actually living in the pit and eating the vegetables from the garden.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{reporter}} Joshua Prager {{wrote an}} article in the Wall Street Journal profiling the long-term toll that Raoul Wallenberg's disappearance had on his family. His mother Maj and his stepfather Fredrik von Dardel spent {{the rest of their lives}} searching for their son. They both committed suicide by overdosing on pills two days apart in 1979. Their daughter Nina Lagergren, Raoul's half-sister, attributed their suicide to their despair about never finding their son. Lagergren and Raoul's half-brother Guy von Dardel established organizations and worked to find their brother or confirmation of his death. At the request of their parents, they were to <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> was alive until the year 2000.|$|E
5|$|Violet {{explains}} to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie {{will be coming}} {{to pick up the}} money from Caesar. The plan is as follows: When Caesar has finished counting the money, Violet will get him a drink to relax him before he showers. Corky will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet will drop the bottle of Scotch that is for Gino and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, she will let Corky in, who will steal the money from a briefcase and leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leaving, but that Gino was not with him. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to skip town because Gino will <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> has been robbed by Caesar, not his son.|$|E

5|$|When {{the series}} begins, Allen is about 15 years old. Although {{most of his}} colleagues <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> is ageing normally, one of his enemies (Nea, who later {{possesses}} his body), suspects {{that he may be}} growing younger. Allen is often accompanied by Timcampy, a small flying golem given him by his mentor (Exorcist general Cross Marian). As a result of the trauma of attempting to revive his guardian, Mana Walker, Allen's reddish-brown hair becomes white. Mana's curse of the boy's left eye allows Allen to distinguish Akuma from humans. Allen is devoted to helping the Akuma find peace until he meets the Exorcists of the Black Order, who become his friends. Realizing that he fights to save the souls of the Akuma and for his human friends, he devotes himself equally to both causes. Allen's master, Cross Marian, notes that the boy (originally cynical and rude), has adopted Mana's formal speech, mannerisms and personality. Allen begins to speak less formally during the series, reverting to his speech before he met Mana.|$|E
25|$|Later, Henri {{became a}} film {{executive}} representing Pathé (USA) in France through Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., {{who was running}} the studio. Many now <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> was given the position, which kept him in France for ten months a year, to simply {{keep him out of}} the way. This marriage ended in divorce in 1930 Soon after, Henri remarried, to actress Constance Bennett.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{the player}} will reach and face Akuma {{in a final}} conflict. Once Akuma is defeated, the player is able to rescue Mariko, though the player must assure that {{he is out of}} a {{fighting}} stance, or else the princess will <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> is an enemy and kill him in one blow. Once Mariko is freed, she and the player leave the fortress together.|$|E

25|$|The {{statement}} “I’m {{a believer}} in social Darwinism,” {{did not come from}} me. In fact, I had to look up the expression to learn what was being referred to. This attack appears to be calling me a Nazi, nothing less. I demand that Mr. Storr refer me to the original sources to which we <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> has referred. Until then, I’ll only say that he has carefully selected phrases and statements out of context, not the sort of referencing that I would have expected from him.|$|E
25|$|By 2005, Gilani's {{training}} {{had advanced}} {{to the point where}} he wanted to fight in Kashmir. Instead, Gilani was referred to Sajid Mir, LeT's foreign recruiter. Under Mir's direction, Gilani went to Philadelphia and legally changed his name to David Coleman Headley, taking his mother's surname. Even though Pennsylvania law requires a background check for name changes, state officials apparently did not uncover Headley's previous drug convictions. The name change would make it easier for Headley to hide his Pakistani ancestry and pass as a Westerner, leading anyone he encountered to <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> was a tourist.|$|E
25|$|He {{thinks it}} ill-advised {{to build the}} doctrines of natural {{religion}} and morality on a hypothesis which many philosophers had rejected, and {{which could not be}} proved against Epicureans, the principal impugners of the existence of laws of nature. He cannot <b>assume,</b> <b>he</b> says, that such ideas existed from eternity in the divine mind, but must start from the data of sense and experience, and thence by search into the nature of things to discover their laws. It is only through nature that we can rise to nature's God. His attributes are not to be known by direct intuition. He, therefore, held that the ground taken up by the Cambridge Platonists could not be maintained against Hobbes.|$|E

25|$|Riis's {{concern for}} the poor and {{destitute}} often caused people to <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> disliked the rich. However, Riis showed no sign of discomfort among the affluent, often asking them for their support. Although seldom involved with party politics, Riis was sufficiently disgusted by the corruption of Tammany Hall to change from being an endorser of the Democratic Party to endorse the Republican Party. The period just before the Spanish–American War was difficult for Riis. He was approached by liberals who suspected that protests of alleged Spanish mistreatment of the Cubans was merely a ruse intended to provide a pretext for US expansionism; perhaps to avoid offending his friend Roosevelt, Riis refused the offer of good payment to investigate this and made nationalist statements.|$|E
25|$|Combs {{served in}} the United States Naval Air Corps during World War II and was {{discharged}} in 1947. After helping combat flooding near the town on Betsy Layne, Combs and some friends purchased a bottle of whisky before returning home. Although Combs said he had only taken one drink, {{he was arrested for}} public intoxication; he said he believed his muddied appearance led the arresting constable to <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> was drunk. In jail, he decided to forego re-enlistment in the Navy and enter the legal profession to correct what he saw as injustices in the legal system. After completing a law curriculum at Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee, he was admitted to the bar in 1951 and began practice in his native Eastern Kentucky. He received his juris doctor degree from Samford University's Cumberland School of Law in 1969.|$|E
25|$|Having {{finished}} his apprenticeship with Hammond, Keats registered {{as a medical}} student at Guy's Hospital (now part of King's College London) and began studying there in October 1815. Within a month of starting, he was accepted as a dresser at the hospital, assisting surgeons during operations, {{the equivalent of a}} junior house surgeon today. It was a significant promotion, that marked a distinct aptitude for medicine; it brought greater responsibility and a heavier workload. Keats's long and expensive medical training with Hammond and at Guy's Hospital led his family to <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> would pursue a lifelong career in medicine, assuring financial security, and it seems that at this point Keats had a genuine desire to become a doctor. He lodged near the hospital, at 28 St Thomas's Street in Southwark, with other medical students, including Henry Stephens who became a famous inventor and ink magnate.|$|E

500|$|Phineas {{is portrayed}} as being an {{extremely}} intelligent, lighthearted, naive, confident, warmhearted and redheaded boy. The Disney Channel promos for Phineas and Ferb describe him as someone who [...] "thinks big", refusing to let any day be ordinary. Povenmire also characterizes him as assertive, someone so secure in his abilities that others <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> is a prodigy. Povenmire and Marsh wanted the series to reflect their own childhood memories of going out {{during the summer and}} have fun, digging trenches and building tunnels, forts, and tree houses.|$|E
500|$|In {{the lead}} single [...] "Hop Is Back", Hopsin pokes fun at Kendrick Lamar and disses Kanye West's newer music. Hopsin {{clarified}} his statements {{in an interview}} with HipHopDX saying he had no ill feelings towards Kendrick Lamar, and that he dissed West because he disliked his new music. [...] "Tears to Snow" [...] is an emotional song about him and his ex-girlfriend having relationship issues and breaking up. In the song he explains how she would <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> would cheat on her. The second verse is also partly about how Hopsin's former colleagues have changed and turned against him. For [...] "Rip Your Heart Out" [...] featuring Tech N9ne, Hopsin created what he called a [...] "weird, funky, dope beat that you can just bop your head to." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{moving to}} Washington, the Hobarts {{established}} {{themselves at the}} Arlington Hotel, which was the Washington home to many political men of the era, including Hanna. Soon, however, Pennsylvania Senator Don Cameron offered them the lease of the house he owned at 21 Madison Place, diagonally across Pennsylvania Avenue from the Executive Mansion (as the White House was still formally known). The asking price was $10,000 per year; the Vice President bargained Cameron down to $8,000 (equal to the vice presidential salary) by suggesting that the public might <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> stole the excess. Among the frequent visitors at {{what came to be}} known as the [...] "Cream White House" [...] was Hanna, by then a senator, who would come by for breakfast and talk with the Vice President until it was time for both to go to the Senate.|$|E

During the chorus, everything around her freezes, and she takes the opportunity to sing at him, [...] "If you want to, I can save you, I can take you away from here..." [...] <b>assuming</b> <b>he</b> cannot hear her. They then go on a bus together, she sits down, <b>assuming</b> <b>he</b> will sit next to her, but he runs into friends, and he ignores her.|$|R

500|$|... "Jessica" [...] was co-written by Betts and Dudek, {{although}} only Betts receives credit. Betts first created the song as an experiment, {{to test whether}} or not he could write a song that could be played with just two fingers, in honor of Gypsy jazz guitar virtuoso Django Reinhardt, who played with two left fingers due to severe burns. When his baby daughter Jessica entered the room and began bouncing around to the melody, Betts attempted to capture her mood with the song. Dudek created the song's bridge when Betts became frustrated with the piece. Dudek was disappointed when he was told he would only be recording the acoustic guitar opening, as Betts felt Dudek performing the harmonies to both [...] "Ramblin' Man" [...] and [...] "Jessica" [...] would lead critics to <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> {{was a member of the}} band. Leavell also contributed heavily to [...] "Jessica", mostly on the arrangement.|$|E
500|$|In the show's pilot episode, Kurt auditions for the New Directions glee club by {{performing}} [...] "Mr. Cellophane" [...] from Chicago. Although he initially hides his homosexuality, {{many of the}} other members <b>assume</b> <b>he</b> is gay. He confides that he is gay to fellow glee club member Mercedes (Amber Riley) in [...] "Acafellas", and the two develop a close friendship. In the following episode, [...] "Preggers", Kurt joins the school football team as a kicker in order to impress his widowed father, Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), and helps the failing team win its first game by kicking the tie-breaking extra point. His heightened confidence leads him to disclose his homosexuality to his father, who not only responds with love and acceptance, but also surprises Kurt by telling him that he has long been aware that Kurt was gay. Kurt quits the football team in [...] "Mash-Up", when Coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) forces the glee club members of the team to choose between the club and the team.|$|E
500|$|The many {{historical}} {{meanings of}} the emblem, while provide a solid ground for its power as the national emblem of Iran, have also provided the rich ground for competing symbols of Iranian identity. One important campaign to abolish the emblem was initiated by Mojtaba Minuvi in 1929. In a report prepared {{at the request of}} the Iranian embassy in London, he insisted that the lion and sun is Turkic in origin. He recommended that the government replaces it with Derafsh-e-Kaviani: [...] "One cannot attributed a national historical story to the lion-and-sun emblem, for it has no connection to ancient pre-Islamic history, there is no evidence that Iranians designed or created it.... We might as well get rid of this remnant of the Turkish people and adopt the flag that symbolizes our mythical grandeur, that is Derafsh-e-Kaviani". His suggestion was ignored. The symbol was challenged during World War I, while Hasan Taqizadeh was publishing the Derafsh-e-Kaviani newspaper in Berlin. In his newspaper, he argued that the lion and sun is neither Iranian in origin nor very ancient as people <b>assume.</b> <b>He</b> insisted that the lion and sun should be replaced by the more Iranian symbol of Derafsh-e-Kaviani.|$|E
