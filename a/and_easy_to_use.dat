5|$|The game {{featured}} advanced {{artificial intelligence}} {{due to the}} inclusion of the game's squad command system. Adams and Lugo will assist Walker in battles and react to the battle situation accordingly even if they are not given any orders. They will also analyse the situation when instructed and decide the best approach to defeat enemies. The battle command system was designed to be accessible <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> so that players would not have {{to spend a lot of}} time managing the squad. Lugo and Adams may get severely injured and if both of them die, the game ends. This mechanic prompts the player to rescue them as quickly as possible, and the system is designed to create tense situations. The AI for enemies is affected by various factors, including visibility and hearing.|$|E
5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It {{is worth noting that}} it is not Hare's intention to divide up the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action for the situation. Such a person would not need a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E

25|$|Traditional dyes used in Persian rugs are {{obtained}} from plants and insects. In 1856, the English chemist William Henry Perkin invented the first aniline dye, mauveine. A {{variety of other}} synthetic dyes were invented thereafter. Cheap, readily prepared <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> as they were compared to natural dyes, their use is documented since the mid 1860s. The tradition of natural dyeing was revived in Turkey in the early 1980s. Chemical analyses led to the identification of natural dyes from antique wool samples, and dyeing recipes and processes were experimentally re-created.|$|E

In addition, this implant features a slightly recessed slot for the superior rectus and a protrusion to fill the superior fornix.|$|E
25|$|When {{the service}} {{initially}} launched with Diablo in November 30, 1996, Battle.net offered {{only a few}} basic services like chatting and game listings. Players could connect to the service, talk with other gamers and join multiplayer games of Diablo. Besides user account data, no game data was stored on the Battle.net servers. When a player connected to a game, they would be connecting directly to the other players in the game. No data was sent through the Battle.net servers. While this made the service quick <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> it quickly led to widespread cheating since players using cheats could modify their game data locally. However, since there was an option to create private games, many players ended up playing with people they knew.|$|E

25|$|Biological {{weapons are}} {{difficult}} to detect, economical <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> making them appeal to the terrorists. The cost of a biological weapon {{is estimated to be}} about 0.05 percent the cost of a conventional weapon in order to produce similar numbers of mass casualties per kilometer square. Moreover, their production is very easy as common technology can be used to produce biological warfare, like that used in production of vaccines, foods, spray devices, beverages and antibiotics. A major factor about biological warfare that attracts terrorists is that they can easily escape, before the government agencies or secret agencies have even started their investigation. This is because the potential organism has incubation period of 3 to 7 days, after which the results begin to appear, thereby giving the terrorists a lead.|$|E
25|$|The paper {{postage stamp}} itself {{was born of}} utility (in England, 1840), as {{something}} simple <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> was needed to confirm that postage had been paid for an item of mail. People could purchase several stamps at one time and {{no longer had to}} make a special trip to pay for postage each time an item was mailed. The postage stamp design was usually printed from a fine engraving and were almost impossible to forge adequately. This is where the appearance of presidents on stamps was introduced. Moreover, the subject theme of a president, along with the honors associated with it, is what began to define the stamp issues in ways that took it beyond the physical postage stamp itself and is why people began to collect them. There exist entire series of stamp issues whose printing was inspired by the subject alone.|$|E
25|$|A {{thermoplastic}} synthetic wax resin mixture {{developed by}} John W Burke and Steve Colton in 1997 {{can be used}} to compensate losses in objects from translucent materials such as alabaster, marble, calcite, diorite, and anhydrite. The mixture consists of polyvinyl acetate (PVAC) AYAC, ethylene acrylic acid (EAA) copolymers A-C 540, and 580, antioxidants Irganox 1076 or 1035, dry pigments, marble powder, and other additives which were all melted together. This wax resin is a better substitute to wax-resins because wax collects dust and dirt and make the fill noticeable. Polyester resin and epoxies are toxic and noxious. The wax-resin is fast <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> making it a possible new alternative to fill materials in the conservation field. The wax-resin works best on losses that allow for large contact with the original, primed surface and on losses that are thicker than 1/16in. Shallow losses and small gaps are more difficult due to the ease in which the fill is pulled out.|$|E

500|$|The {{fourth-generation}} iPad received primarily favorable {{reviews from}} critics and commentators. The review by Gareth Beavis of TechRadar praised the device for its high resolution Retina Display, which TechRadar wrote is [...] "...one {{of the most}} impressive we've seen on a tablet to date." [...] However, the reviewer also wrote that the screen [...] "lacks the 'punch' seen in Super AMOLED screens seen on devices like the Samsung Galaxy Note 2." [...] The review also praised the interface of the iPad for its simple design <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> layout. Additionally, other aspects, such as the design of the iPad and updated SoC were noted and praised in the review. Critically, Beavis noted that the iPad can still moderately heat up under medium usage, however not to the extent seen in the third-generation iPad. Tim Stevens of Engadget praised the Retina Display and labelled it as the best screen available on tablets. Benchmarks and tests conducted by Engadget resulted in Stevens concluding that the fourth-generation iPad is the fastest Apple mobile device available, surpassing a [...] "record" [...] that the iPhone 5 held for a brief period.|$|E
500|$|Remarking that Brain Age 2 {{uses the}} same formula as Brain Age [...] "with some {{different}} variables thrown in", Game Informer noted that players' opinions of the original Brain Age {{will most likely be}} similar to how much they appreciate Brain Age 2. GameZone was excited about the Sudoku portion of the game, which they complimented was [...] "worth the entire game itself and will provide many hours of fun". They found the daily training and quick play modes [...] "simply addictive", and appreciated the game's [...] "simple <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> interface". The video game website IGN felt differently, however, noting that the challenges felt fresh, with the exception of Sudoku. IGN agreed with GameZone on a particular point, however, writing that both the original Brain Age, and Brain Age 2, have [...] "calm, clean interface". The television series X-Play was intrigued by Brain Age 2s promise to improve a person's intelligence. GameSpy called the game [...] "the ideal video game gateway drug" [...] because of its accessibility {{to a wide variety of}} people, lack of requirements for special physical dexterity or experience, and regular reward system to motivate the player. They also considered Brain Age 2 a [...] "noble effort towards the betterment of our mental health through a painless training regimen". Game Revolution complimented the game's intelligent use of Nintendo DS features, [...] "fun" [...] sound effects, and [...] "competent" [...] handwriting recognition. Singapore's The Straits Times considered Brain Age 2 a good investment, despite noting that hardcore gamers might find the minigames [...] "gimmicky". Recognizing that Nintendo intends to use the game to target baby boomers, The Globe and Mail writes that they were tempted to play the game at work and justify it as a self-improvement program.|$|E
