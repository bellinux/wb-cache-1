For a long time the Lake Plateau turned out to be <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> Niedernberg, as in the summer thousands of people from all over the district came to use the biggest lake as an unofficial bathing pond. This led to catastrophic traffic-flow problems on Kreisstraße (district road) MIL 38, for visitors would simply park their cars right at the edge of the road. Unapproved parties at the lake led to heavy pollution of much of the lakeside.|$|E

40|$|Abstract –Piracy {{continues}} to be <b>a</b> very <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> ship operators, ship owners, cargo owners, insurance companies, flag states, and host states. Fortunately, the nature and locations of modern day acts of piracy tend to be fairly predictable and are concentrated in certain regions of the world. Potential acts of maritime terrorism are highly unpredictable and pose a worldwide threat since terrorists may attack a country’s interests abroad. Commercial ship operators can take concrete steps to help defend themselves against maritime terrorism and piracy. Many ship self defense countermeasures against piracy and maritime terrorism are simple and inexpensive to implement. Developing a thorough ship security plan is essential for commercial ship self defense. I...|$|R

40|$|The general {{problem of}} {{software}} and hardware interface has been discussed since the first personal computers had appeared on the market. Interface solutions, proposed by the CAD software producers themselves, have been deeply criticised. In fact, learning {{how to use the}} software means how to operate its interface.

The problem is even more complicated in case of interfaces for many users. They should help in the processes of computer networks based cooperative design. In this paper we try to juxtapose the main features of user interfaces in CAD, especially ones for collaborative work. The most important problems were detected, and conclusions were made with an aim to research interfaces adequate for architect's work in the future. ...|$|R

On each leg of the journey his fore-runners had a rush to find lodgings for him - in the large towns he slept in the town-house of that city's richest citizen (who had to move out during the king's stay), but more often he slept in inns.

50|$|The memory {{management}} system had weaknesses; the system heap was not protected from errant applications, as {{would have been}} possible if the system architecture had supported memory protection, and this was frequently the cause of system problems and crashes.In addition, the handle-based approach also opened up a source of programming errors, where pointers to data within such relocatable blocks could not be guaranteed to remain valid across calls that might cause memory to move. This was <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> almost every system API that existed. Because of the transparency of system-owned data structures at the time, the APIs could do little to solve this. Thus the onus was on the programmer not to create such pointers, or at least manage them very carefully by dereferencing all handles after every such API call. Since many programmers were not generally familiar with this approach, early Mac programs suffered frequently from faults arising from this.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{this period}} the Albanian {{speaking}} zones in Thesprotia and adjacent areas that later {{became part of}} Albania was considered a nuisance for both the Greek state and Christians of Epirus who self identified as Greeks. The non-Greek linguistic factor posed a hindrance to Greek territorial ambitions. Tackling this issue was undertaken through two policies. The first was that Greek historians and politicians attempted through concerted efforts to conceal {{the existence of the}} Albanian language within the region. The second was to present the argument that the language spoken by the local population had no relation upon their national affiliations. According to the prevalent ideology in Greece at the time, every Orthodox Christian was considered Greek, whereas after 1913, especially the area of Southern Albania deemed [...] "Northern Epirus" [...] by Greece, Muslims were considered Albanians. With the incorporation of the area within Greece, these discursive polices alongside the practical were continued. This was due to the sizable Albanian Muslim population being considered <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> the Greek state and hence any pro-Albanian movement eventuating had to be eliminated by all means.|$|E

This plant configuration is typically used in the manufacturing of specialty chemicals. The problem is modeled as a large-scale mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP) and a reformulation technique is applied to linearize it {{in the space of}} the integer variables. The Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions are exploited in the resulting model in order to effectively apply Generalized Benders Decomposition. This avoids the explicit solution of extremely large nonlinear subproblems. At the same time, a computational scheme is proposed to strengthen the bounds of the master problem and therefore achieve fast convergence. The proposed technique was applied to <b>a</b> <b>real</b> world <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> polymer production plant.
