40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] As <b>auranofin</b> resembles some {{neutrophil}} activating sulphur containing compounds, it {{was decided}} to investigate whether it had activating effects on neutrophil migration in addition to the published inhibitory effects. METHODS [...] The Boyden chamber assay was used to determine the migration velocity of human neutrophils. The difference between chemotaxis and chemokinesis was established with a chequerboard assay. RESULTS [...] Low concentrations of <b>auranofin</b> stimulated human neutrophil migration; concentrations of <b>auranofin</b> higher than 1 mumol/l were inhibitory. Inhibitors of leukotriene formation, or of protein kinase C, had the same effect on <b>auranofin</b> induced potentiation of migration as on fMLP activated migration. <b>Auranofin,</b> at a concentration of 100 nmol/l, caused a transient increase in the cGMP level of neutrophils. The <b>auranofin</b> induced increase in migration was strongly inhibited by methylene blue and by LY 83583, two inhibitors of cGMP accumulation. CONCLUSIONS [...] The <b>auranofin</b> induced enhancement of migration is partly due to a chemokinetic effect, but mainly due to a chemotactic effect. The potentiating effect of <b>auranofin</b> on migration is not specifically due to the ability of the drug to inhibit protein kinase C activity or to generate leukotrienes. These results suggest that the enhancement of neutrophil migration by low levels of <b>auranofin</b> is related to the enhancement of cGMP levels in neutrophils...|$|E
40|$|<b>Auranofin</b> (SKF-D 39162) is an oral gold {{preparation}} {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis. One of its major side effects is diarrhoea. To determine one possible mechanism for this we compared the effects of <b>auranofin</b> and myochrysine on intestinal water and solute transport in the rat. Jejunal perfusion with 2 mM <b>auranofin</b> (n = 5) induced fluid and electrolyte secretion and inhibited glucose absorption (p less than 0. 01). <b>Auranofin</b> (0. 2 mM) induced fluid secretion in the jejunum (n = 5; p less than 0. 01) and colon (n = 6; p less than 0. 01). In contrast, 2 mM myochrysine enhanced jejunal water and electrolyte absorption (n = 6; p less than 0. 02). Both compounds enhanced absorption of mannitol (p less than 0. 01). Perfusion of 0. 2 mM <b>auranofin</b> for two hours had no significant effect on mucosal c-AMP levels (n = 4). After perfusion for two hours with 2 mM <b>auranofin</b> the jejunal mucosa showed severe injury by light and scanning electronmicroscopy while myochrysine had no apparent effect. The damage after perfusion with 0. 2 mM <b>auranofin</b> for two hours was less severe. <b>Auranofin</b> was more rapidly absorbed than myochrysine (p less than 0. 05).

40|$|<b>Auranofin,</b> {{a member}} of a class of {{compounds}} with disease modifying activity, was given to arthritic rats to determine if it could reverse the abnormal plasma concentrations of fibronectin (Fn), C reactive protein (CRP), and albumin, which were unaffected by treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). When <b>auranofin</b> was orally administered for two weeks to adjuvant induced arthritic rats it significantly inhibited swelling of the injected and non-injected paws at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg. Rocket electroimmunoassay measurement of plasma proteins in normal, arthritic, and <b>auranofin</b> treated arthritic rats indicated that <b>auranofin</b> at 10 mg/kg significantly decreased (by 77 %) the abnormally high concentration of arthritic rat plasma Fn, though it had no effect on Fn concentrations when administered to normal rats.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Auranofin</b> is a gold-containing {{compound}} {{classified by}} the World Health Organization as a clinically established rheumatoid arthritis therapeutic agent. Through drug screening for novel anticancer therapeutics, we unexpectedly identi-fied <b>auranofin</b> as a potent anticancer agent against a p 53 -null ovarian carcinoma SKOV 3 cell line. However, the molecular mechanism underlying auranofin-mediated anticancer activity in ovarian cancer cells is basically unknown. Here, {{we show that}} <b>auranofin</b> inhibits proliferation and survival of SKOV 3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. <b>Auranofin</b> treat-ment activates the pro-apoptotic caspase- 3, increases protein levels of apoptosis-inducing proteins Bax and Bim and reduces {{the expression of the}} anti-apoptotic mediator Bcl- 2 in SKOV 3 cells. Moreover, <b>auranofin</b> downregulates IκB kinase (IKK) -β and promotes nuclear localization and the activation of FOXO 3 tumor suppressor, leading to cellular apoptosis in SKOV 3 cells. In contrast, silencing FOXO 3 diminishes the pro-apoptotic signaling of <b>auranofin</b> in SKOV 3 cells. These results suggest that <b>auranofin</b> may induce caspase- 3 -mediated apoptosis in a FOXO 3 -dependent manner. The observed upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes and apoptosis in cancer cells without p 53 in response to <b>auranofin</b> suggests a novel p 53 -independent mechanism underlying auranofin-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>auranofin</b> on granule protein {{secretion}} from neutrophils was investigated by a haemolytic plaque assay which can detect release of lactoferrin and myeloperoxidase from single adherent neutrophils. Lactoferrin secretion {{in response to}} N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) was enhanced at low (0. 25 - 1. 0 micrograms/ml) and inhibited at high concentrations of <b>auranofin</b> (50 % inhibition (IC 50) at 3. 7 micrograms/ml). A similar biphasic effect was also seen on degranulation mediated by granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (IC 50 1. 8 micrograms/ml). In contrast, exocytosis mediated by tumour necrosis factor was inhibited even at low concentrations of <b>auranofin</b> (IC 50 0. 6 micrograms/ml). Secretion induced by phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate and A 23187 was only inhibited at very high <b>auranofin</b> concentrations (IC 50 10 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively). The effect of <b>auranofin</b> on myeloperoxidase secretion was also assessed and the IC 50 values for the respective agents were as follows: tumour necrosis factor 0. 7 micrograms/ml, fMLP 1. 6 micrograms/ml, and phorbol myristate acetate 7. 6 micrograms/ml. When neutrophils were preincubated with <b>auranofin</b> (4 micrograms/ml) and then exposed to fMLP, tumour necrosis factor, or GM-CSF {{in the absence of}} <b>auranofin,</b> lactoferrin release was enhanced if the preincubation time was short (one to three minutes) and inhibited when the time of preincubation was longer.

40|$|<b>Auranofin</b> is a gold(I) -containing drug in {{clinical}} {{use as an}} antiarthritic agent. Recent studies showed that <b>auranofin</b> manifests interesting antiparasitic actions very likely arising from inhibition of parasitic enzymes involved in {{the control of the}} redox metabolism. Trypanothione reductase is a key enzyme of Leishmania infantum polyamine-dependent redox metabolism, and a validated target for antileishmanial drugs. As trypanothione reductase contains a dithiol motif at its active site and gold(I) compounds are known to be highly thiophilic, we explored whether <b>auranofin</b> might behave as an effective enzyme inhibitor and as a potential antileishmanial agent. Notably, enzymatic assays revealed that <b>auranofin</b> causes indeed a pronounced enzyme inhibition. To gain a deeper insight into the molecular basis of enzyme inhibition, crystals of the auranofin-bound enzyme, in the presence of NADPH, were prepared, and the X-ray crystal structure of the auranofin–trypanothione reductase–NADPH complex was solved at 3. 5  Å resolution. In spite of the rather low resolution, these data were of sufficient quality as to identify the presence of the gold center and of the thiosugar of <b>auranofin,</b> and to locate them within the overall protein structure. Gold binds to the two active site cysteine residues of TR, i. e. Cys 52 and Cys 57, while the thiosugar moiety of <b>auranofin</b> binds to the trypanothione binding site; thus <b>auranofin</b> appears to inhibit TR through a dual mechanism. <b>Auranofin</b> kills the promastigote stage of L. infantum at micromolar concentration; these findings will contribute to the design of new drugs against leishmaniasis...|$|E
40|$|Platelets {{are central}} to normal {{haemostasis}} and must be tightly controlled to prevent thrombosis. However, drug treatments that also affect platelets could lead to unwanted side effects on haemostasis or thrombosis. In this study, the effect of <b>auranofin</b> on platelets was tested. <b>Auranofin,</b> a gold-based thioredoxin reductase (TRXR) inhibitor, has been previously used in arthritis. Recently <b>auranofin</b> and other inhibitors of the thioredoxin system have been proposed as novel anti-cancer therapies. TRXR {{is an important part}} of the antioxidant defences in many cells that maintain intracellular proteins in their reduced state. TRXR activity in platelets could be completely inhibited by <b>auranofin.</b> Auranofin-treated platelets showed several features of cell death, including an inability to aggregate in response to thrombin, leakage of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase, and surface exposure of procoagulant phosphatidylserine. <b>Auranofin</b> increased platelet reactive oxygen species production and intracellular calcium concentration. DTT, a sulfydyl reducing agent, and BAPTA-AM, which chelates intracellular calcium, prevented auranofin-induced phosphatidylserine exposure. These data suggest that TRXR {{is an important part of}} the platelet antioxidant defence. TRXR inhibition by <b>auranofin</b> triggers oxidative stress and disrupts intracellular calcium homeostasis, leading to platelet necrosis.

When the cells were transfected with a specific siRNA for Nrf 2, the gene expression was perfectly blocked.
