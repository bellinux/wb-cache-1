When the official results were released, Chandler had received 119,812 votes to 119,163 for Barr. Barr petitioned Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson for a recanvass of the voting machines in the district, but this yielded only one <b>additional</b> <b>vote</b> for Barr.

25|$|Voting {{power in}} the IMF {{is based on a}} quota system. Each member has a number of basic votes (each member's number of basic votes equals 5.502% of the total votes), plus one <b>additional</b> <b>vote</b> for each Special Drawing Right (SDR) of 100,000 of a member country's quota. The Special Drawing Right is the unit of account of the IMF and {{represents}} a claim to currency. It is based on a basket of key international currencies. The basic votes generate a slight bias in favour of small countries, but the additional votes determined by SDR outweigh this bias. Changes in the voting shares require approval by a supermajority of 85% of voting power.|$|E

2500|$|In 1972, McGee {{introduced}} S. 352, {{which would}} allow eligible voters to register by mail in federal elections. [...] The bill would establish a new Voter Registration Administration {{as part of the}} U.S. Census Bureau to administer the registration program. Under the procedure, postcard forms would be mailed to all postal addresses and residences, and the cards would have to be returned to local registration agents no later than 30 days before a federal election. Processing of the forms would be paid for by the Voter Registration Administration. [...] McGee believed argued that existing methods discourage registration citing the fact that 62 million people did not vote in 1972 election, nearly half of all Americans eligible to vote. [...] Opponents believed that the proposal would destroy the two-party system, lead to increased fraud, and cost too much to implement. [...] The Nixon Administration formally opposed the bill citing the potential for fraud and cost but McGee's committee reported the bill with only Hiram Fong, the Committee's ranking Republican member, opposing. [...] During floor debate In spring 1973, the bill was filibustered for almost a month. [...] The 13th successful cloture vote since in the Senate came after two earlier attempts to terminate a four-week filibuster on the voter registration bill (S 352) failed. Had the May 9 vote also fallen short, McGee had warned opponents of S 352 during floor debate that not only would there have been another cloture vote, but “if necessary there'll be another and another and another.” [...] The nearly 100 per cent attendance for the May 9 vote, plus three switches in favor of cloture on the third try, gave the cloture motion the necessary two-thirds vote. John C. Stennis (D Miss.) was the only senator to miss the vote. [...] Earlier efforts to shut off the talkathon on the bill failed by two and three votes, respectively. The April 30 vote was 56-31; the May 3 vote was 60-34. On May 9, cloture succeeded by a one-vote margin, 67-32. [...] Two Republicans and one Democrat switched from opposition to support for cloture on the May 9 67-32 vote. The Republicans were Robert T. Stafford (Vt.) and Milton R. Young (N.D.); both had voted against cloture on the two previous cloture motions. The Democrat was Russell B. Long (La.), who opposed cloture on the May -3 vote. [...] In addition, supporters of cloture gained four of five new votes of members who did not vote May 3: Alan Bible (D Nev.), Mark O. Hatfield (R Ore.), Joseph M. Montoya (D N.M.) and William B. Saxbe (R Ohio). John Sparkman (D Ala.), one of the other two members (along with Stennis) who did not vote May 3, cast the only <b>additional</b> <b>vote</b> against cloture. [...] Final passage of S. 352 was successful on May 9, 1973 by a vote of 57-32. [...] The legislation died after the House failed to take action on the bill.|$|E

On {{each of the five}} in-game days, the player is required to consecutively play three songs, and for each song, he or she is given a score that represents votes given by the in-game audience. For the third song every day, the player may choose to compete against a computer-controlled opponent, represented as idols from 876 Production, 961 Production's Jupiter, and characters from The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls and other Shiny Festa games.
