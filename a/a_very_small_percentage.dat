Many of the most important problems (such as Goldbach’s conjecture and Fermat’s Last theorem) can be formulated in terms of the sumset S + S = {x + y: x, y ∈ S} of a set of integers S. A finite set of integers A is sum-dominated if |A + A |> |A − A|.

We show that if we take subsets of larger and larger finite groups uniformly at random, then not only does the probability of a set being sum-dominated tend to zero but the probability that |A+A | = |A−A | tends to one, and hence a typical set is balanced in this case. The cause of this marked difference in behavior is that subsets of { 0, [...] ., n} have a fringe, whereas finite groups do not.

Grouped with Argentina and Brazil, Mexico is part of a region which is third in cheese production, behind Europe and the US. Cheese sales in Mexico were 218,000 tons in 2003, with fresh (not aged) cheeses making up over one-third of the market, the largest segment. Only 126,200 tons of the cheese consumed in the country that year were produced domestically, with the rest imported. About 10% of the milk production in the country is dedicated to the making of dairy products, most of which is cheese. The overwhelming majority of cheese is made with cows’ milk. While a number of cheeses are made with goats’ milk, they are not as popular and have gotten more difficult to find in markets.

Production Regions Grain sorghum {{grown in the}} coastal plain of North Carolina is mostly used as a rotational crop behind potatoes, wheat, or other early season crops. In the piedmont, some sorghum is grown for both grain and silage. Productions Practices Sorghum is grown in North Carolina much as field corn is done, although it is usually planted later. The vast majority of corn is rain-fed rather than irrigated, though sweet corn is more typically irrigated. Corn is grown {{on a wide variety}} of soil types from loamy sands to clays to organic soils. Conventional, strip-tillage, and no-tillage culture are all widely practiced. Recently, there has been a shift to conservation tillage (no-till, strip-till, minimum-till), and this trend continues at present. Typically corn grown in the coastal plain is rotated, whereas the crop is usually not rotated when grown in the piedmont or mountains. Field corn is characterized by early inputs of fertilizer, herbicide, and insecticides, followed by little attention until harvest. Field corn culture, including harvest and postharvest handling, is totally mechanized. Sweet corn culture is similar to field corn culture except for an intensive use of insecticides (during the reproductive period), irrigation, and manual labor...|$|R

40|$|There {{is nothing}} {{absolute}} in this world. However, this study could prove that vagueness is inherit {{in the nature}} of language. Vagueness exists in today's newspapers. Concerning this situation and so far there has been no thesis discussing vagueness in newspapers, the researcher could find that vagueness in newspapers is an interesting topic to be further discussed. Moreover, vagueness in newspapers can be used as an instrument to determine the quality of the newspapers. Vagueness is considered as an uncertain, unclear, or imprecise thing which is lack of specification. Moreover, vagueness should be avoided in communicating news since its existence causes misunderstanding among the readers. Driven by her curiousity to know more about vagueness in the writing of news, the researcher formulated two questions, "What kinds of vagueness are found in politics, social-affairs, and economics news in the first pages of Jawa Pos newspaper during the May- 2000 edition?, and, "How is the quality of Jawa Pos newspaper on May- 2000 in terms of writing politics, social-affairs, and economics news in the first pages viewed from the four kinds of vagueness?, as the research questions of the study. According to Kempson in Semantic Theory, there are four kinds of vagueness, namely referential vagueness, indeterminacy of the meaning of an item or phrase, lack of specification in the meaning of an item, and the meaning of an item involves the disjunction of different interpretations. Depending on these kinds of vagueness, the researcher could find kinds of vagueness in a newspaper and judge its quality concerning its ability avoiding vagueness. In line with this case, this study analyzed the news on politics, social-affairs, and economics of the first pages of Jawa Pos newspaper during the edition of May 2000, to find the vagueness contained in the news and to judge the quality of the newspaper under study. The vagueness found was then categorized into referential vagueness, indeterminacy of the meaning of an item or phrase, lack of specification in the meaning of an item, and the meaning of an item involves the disjunction of different interpretations. After that, the researcher count the percentage of the quality that Jawa Pos acquired. The lower the precentage is, the better the quality of Jawa Pos newspaper would be. The analysis on the news found that there were three kinds of vagueness in the news. They were indeterminacy of the meaning of an item or phrase, lack of specification in the meaning of an item, and the meaning of an item involves the disjunction of different interpretations.
