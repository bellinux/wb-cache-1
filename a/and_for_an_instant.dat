[...] In the end, Schulz [...] "didn't say a wordbig tears rolled down as he lay there; Schultz was thoroughly beaten, but it took the entire Pennsylvania eleven to do it".|$|E

It is also from Kaiō-sama that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the , an energy sphere created by gathering ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans. After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive the ones killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Freeza, who destroyed the Saiyans' home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Freeza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.|$|R
40|$|Although the Sor Juana {{archetype}} {{seems to}} be a constant in recent works by Mexican women writers, this essay examines the works of Ana Clavel and Cristina Rivera Garza, for their engaging discussion on gender matters. In their writings, Sor Juana behaves like a man or becomes one, explores the world of masculinity, and places women and men on the same continuum, regardless of sex, sexual orientation and behavior. Under their fictional scope, Sor Juana stops being a rara avis and “presents ” herself with the worries of any and every woman <b>and</b> man, disconnected <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> from her intellectual quests. By virtue of these intertextual dialogues, we can successfully revive Sor Juana today, even if every study of her life and works is, to a certain degree, a creation of our own, inevitably influenced by the world we live in, the books we read and the theories that shape our imagination...|$|R
40|$|At {{extremely}} high temperatures and densities, protons and neutrons may dissolve into a "soup" of quarks and gluons, called the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). <b>For</b> <b>a</b> few microseconds, {{shortly after the}} Big Bang, the Universe {{was filled with the}} QGP matter. The search and study of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) {{is one of the most}} fundamental research topics of our times. The QGP matter has been probed by colliding heavy ions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York and the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Geneva. By colliding heavy-ions at a speed close to that of light, scientists aim to obtain - albeit over a tiny volume of the size of <b>a</b> nucleus <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> infinitesimally short <b>instant</b> - <b>a</b> QGP state.

500|$|Some players used [...] "standbying" [...] to cheat, {{in which}} the player hosting the game {{intentionally}} presses the standby button {{on his or her}} modem; this results in all players except the cheaters freezing in place. This way, the cheater would be given time to accomplish an objective in the game. [...] "Dummying" [...] involves using an Elite character and a vehicle, exploiting a glitch which would cause a doppelganger of the player to appear. Cheating also includes softmodding, in which a player uses devices such as Action Replay and computer programs to gain unfair advantages, and bridging, which uses computer programs to give a player [...] "host" [...] status, and therefore the ability to disconnect other players from the game session. A game exploitation called [...] "superbouncing" [...] or [...] "superjumping" [...] is labeled cheating by many in the Xbox Live community, and Bungie employees have described it as cheating when used in matchmaking. Another exploit called [...] "BXR" [...] allowed players to melee, cancel the animation, <b>and</b> quickly attack <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> kill; this exploit and many others were removed from the game's sequel.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Autoimmune rheumatic {{diseases}} are common and confront society with serious medical, social, and financial burdens imposed by their debilitating nature. Many autoimmune diseases {{are associated with}} a par-ticular set of autoantibodies, which have emerged as highly useful to define and classify disease, predict flares, or monitor efficacy of therapy. However, current practice for monitoring autoantibodies is protracted, labor-intensive, and expensive. This review provides an overview on the value of point-of-care (POC) biosensor technology in the diagnosis and management of patients with autoimmune {{rheumatic diseases}}. Real-time mea-surement of autoantibodies will clearly benefit the rheumatology practice in emergency and urgent care settings, where definitive diagnosis is essential for initi-ation of correct critical care therapy. Immediate sero-logical information in clinic will provide considerable value for long-term patient care <b>and</b> <b>an</b> opportunity <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>instant,</b> result-deduced therapeutic action, avoiding delays and improving compliance, especially in field-based and remote areas. We describe the particular autoantibodies that are useful disease and activity markers and would, therefore, be attractive to POC applications. Already existing biosensors and platforms that show promise for autoantibody testing are summa-rized and comparatively evaluated. As POC assessment is gaining momentum in several areas of patient care, we propose that rheumatology is poised to benefit from this innovative and affordable technology...|$|R
