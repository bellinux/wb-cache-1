5|$|In conclusion, {{the insistence}} of ahimsa {{is not so much}} about non-injury to others <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> non-injury and spiritual welfare of the self. The {{ultimate}} rationale of ahimsa is fundamentally about karmic results of the hiṃsā on self rather than the concern about the well being of other beings for its own sake.|$|E

They are surrounded by Bugs, and a brain bug uses its proboscis to pierce Zander's skull and eat his brain. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> {{to do the same}} to Carmen, she cuts off its proboscis with a knife. Rico arrives and threatens the Bugs with a small nuclear bomb, which the brain bug recognizes. They flee, while the brain bug makes its escape. Arachnids pursue them, and Watkins, mortally wounded, sacrifices himself by detonating the bomb to enable the others to escape.|$|E
25|$|Oroonoko is {{the first}} English novel to show Africans in a {{sympathetic}} manner. At the same time, this novel {{is as much about}} the nature of kingship <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> the nature of race. Oroonoko is a prince, and he is of noble lineage whether of African or European descent, and the novel's regicide is devastating to the colony. The theatrical nature of the plot follows from Behn's previous experience as a dramatist. The language she uses in Oroonoko is far more straightforward than in her other novels, and she dispenses {{with a great deal of}} the emotional content of her earlier works. Further, the novel is unusual in Behn's fictions by having a very clear love story without complications of gender roles.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{agree that}} Skin & Bone {{is as much}} about Los Angeles and the film {{industry}} <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> prostitution or even homosexuality. [...] Writing in Bright Lights Film Journal, critic Gary Morris suggests that the film is [...] "inevitably set in Los Angeles, amid that city's arid strip malls, newsstands, and endless dusty streets" [...] and he points to the significance of Ghislaine's constant movement through the city, [...] "looking glamorous and inscrutable in her opaque sunglasses".|$|E

500|$|Several {{critics have}} focused on the theme of motherhood. In [...] "Mothers and Daughters/Aging and Dying", Claire Sprague wrote that Lessing often dwells on the theme of mothers passing their {{behaviours}} onto their daughters, and how the cycle of daughters fighting their mothers permeates each generation. The British novelist Jane Rogers said that The Good Terrorist [...] "is as unsparing and incisive about motherhood <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> the extreme left", and that motherhood here [...] "is terrible": Alice's mother is reduced to despair continually yielding to her selfish daughter's demands; Alice mothers Jasper, and has a similar despairing relationship with him. Rogers added that motherhood is depicted here as a compulsion to protect the weak, despite their propensity to retaliate and hurt you.|$|E

Archer is angered at having his own method of stealing engine components (as seen in [...] "") used against him, but they finally agree to work towards their shared mission. Meanwhile, T'Pol meets her older self and discuss her addiction to Trelium-D and her relationship with Tucker. The Enterprises then enter the nebula, but Archer's is quickly disabled. Lorian's then tows it into the corridor using a tractor beam, intending, as it turns to attack the Kovaalan ships, to follow shortly. Archer's Enterprise arrives safely, but old Enterprise never emerges and Archer wonders if, by successfully traversing the corridor, they ceased to exist. His thoughts are soon cut short as Degra arrives for their rendezvous.|$|E
500|$|The {{style of}} the Rights of Men mirrors much of Burke's own text. It has no clear structure; like Reflections, the text follows the mental {{associations}} made by the author as she was writing. Wollstonecraft's political treatise is written, like Burke's, {{in the form of}} a letter: his to C. J. F. DePont, a young Frenchman, and hers to Burke himself. Using the same form, metaphors, and style as Burke, she turns his own argument back on him. The Rights of Men is as much about language and argumentation <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> political theory; in fact, Wollstonecraft claims that these are inseparable. She advocates, as one scholar writes, [...] "simplicity and honesty of expression, and argument employing reason rather than eloquence." [...] At the beginning of the pamphlet, she appeals to Burke: [...] "Quitting now the flowers of rhetoric, let us, Sir, reason together." ...|$|E
500|$|Theologian Dale Allison {{recognises}} [...] "Deep Blue" [...] as Harrison's [...] "musically {{beautiful and}} lyrically moving" [...] {{response to his}} mother's death, a [...] "prayer to God for help, light, love, and understanding {{in the midst of}} personal grief". Ian Inglis praises the song's [...] "uncluttered production and economical backing", adding: [...] "'Deep Blue' is unlike anything he had written or recorded at that time, and its relative obscurity is undeserved." [...] While comparing the song favourably with better-known compositions by Lennon ("Julia") and McCartney ("Yesterday", [...] "Let It Be"), Inglis concludes: [...] "Where they differ is that Harrison's song is about himself as much <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> his mother; her death is a starting point for an exploration of the 'suffering' and 'darkness' that afflict us all." [...] Elliot Huntley describes it as [...] "a plaintive acoustic guitar tune" [...] that became an [...] "unjustly overlooked B-side".|$|E
5000|$|Ford’s novel {{relied heavily}} on the {{criticism}} of “throughout…Ford explores gentry, patriarchy, and imperialism {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries."

500|$|GHTV was {{designed}} by FreeStyleGames {{to allow them to}} provide new music without having to secure more stringent music licensing rights. FreeStyleGames found that this mode attracted the attention of bands who were eager to offer their music for it; the bands saw GHTV as comparable to the marketing that music television channels had done in the 1980s and 1990s, putting the imagery of the band at the player as they played along. FreeStyleGames also compared GHTV to music services like Spotify and Pandora. This approach makes it easier to secure licensing rights, and fits in better with the current [...] "throwaway culture" [...] nature of society today according to Jackson. Jackson explained that the feature and its curated playlists were [...] "about discovering music as much <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> going and finding music you know you already like". Activision's Hirshberg stated that GHTV was developed as a better means to provide new songs to players through a round-the-clock content platform, rather than relying on scheduled downloadable content, allowing the company to provide a much larger quantity of songs, with plans for [...] "hundreds at launch on day one" [...] of the game's release.|$|E
500|$|Yet another {{interpretation}} is that Dylan is directing the farewell to himself, particularly his acoustic performer self. The opening line [...] "You must leave now" [...] {{can be a}} command, similar to the line [...] "Go away from my window" [...] that opens [...] "It Ain't Me, Babe". But {{it can also be}} an imperative, meaning just that it is necessary that you leave. And the song is as much about new beginnings <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> endings. The song not only notes the requirement that Baby Blue leave, but also includes the hope that Baby Blue will move forward, in lines such as [...] "Strike another match, go start anew". If Dylan is singing the song to himself, then he himself would be the [...] "vagabond who's rapping at your door / standing in the clothes that you once wore". That is, the new, electric, surrealist Dylan would be the vagabond, not yet having removed the [...] "clothes" [...] of the old protest singer. Alternatively, the vagabond and [...] "stepping stones" [...] referenced in the song have been interpreted as Dylan's folk audience whom he needs to leave behind. He would also be telling himself to [...] "Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you." [...] Others to whom he may be saying farewell in the song are any of the women he had known, the political left or to the illusions of his youth.|$|E

50|$|Initially, {{interpreted}} languages {{were compiled}} line-by-line; that is, each line <b>was</b> compiled <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to <b>be</b> executed, {{and if a}} loop or subroutine caused certain lines to be executed multiple times, they would be recompiled every time. This has become much less common. Most so-called interpreted languages use an intermediate representation, which combines compiling and interpreting.|$|R
2500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} the author [...] "has given us a clear, almost {{controversial}} book that draws on the text and teachings of an ancient mystical faith and applies them {{to the concerns of}} contemporary life.

2500|$|Thomas was {{reconciled}} to the Catholic Church in the mid-1990s.

2500|$|The Last Holiday is as {{much about}} his life <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> context, the theater of late 20th century America — from Jim Crow to the Reagan '80s and from Beale Street to 57th Street. The {{narrative}} is not, however, a rise-and-fall retelling of Scott-Heron's life and career. It doesn't connect all the dots. It moves off-the-beat, at its own speed ... This approach to revelation lends the book an episodic quality, like oral storytelling does. It winds around, it repeats itself.|$|E
