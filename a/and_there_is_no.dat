5|$|A nearby village, Niguili, {{was located}} {{near the mouth of}} Aliso Creek likely near the {{confluence}} of Aliso and Sulphur Creeks. Present-day Laguna Niguel takes its name from this settlement. The Acjachemen were renamed the Juaneño by Spanish priests in the 18th century, who established a mission at the present-day location of San Juan Capistrano. Following the Spanish arrival, most Juaneño clustered around the mission in the south. Like many other once widespread Juaneño villages, Niguili was likely abandoned soon after, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> trace of it remaining.|$|E

Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur, notably in Pakistan and North Korea, building on facilities and expertise from civilian nuclear operations.

But she died before the construction ended, so the church was never cared for by Elizabeth Petrovna. After Elizabeth's death, the Kiev court took no interest maintaining in the church, last consecrated in 1767.

5|$|Einsteinium(III) oxide (Es2O3) was {{obtained}} by burning einsteinium(III) nitrate. It forms colorless cubic crystals, which were first characterized from microgram samples sized about 30 nanometers. Two other phases, monoclinic and hexagonal, are known for this oxide. The formation of a certain Es2O3 phase depends on the preparation technique and sample history, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> clear phase diagram. Interconversions between the three phases can occur spontaneously, {{as a result of}} self-irradiation or self-heating. The hexagonal phase is isotypic with lanthanum(III) oxide where the Es3+ ion is surrounded by a 6-coordinated group of O2− ions.|$|E
5|$|Envenomation from a redback spider bite {{produces}} a syndrome known as latrodectism. A {{small but significant}} percentage of people bitten develop significant pain or systemic symptoms.

5|$|Nielsen {{views the}} brachiopods and closely related phoronids as {{affiliated}} with the deuterostome pterobranchs because their lophophores are driven by one cilium per cell, while those of bryozoans, which he regards as protosomes, have multiple cilia per cell. However, pterobranchs are hemichordates and probably closely related to echinoderms, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> evidence that the latest common ancestor of pterobranchs and other hemichordates or the latest common ancestor of hemichordates and echinoderms was sessile and fed by means of tentacles.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November, he {{was sworn}} in as a Privy Counsellor.
