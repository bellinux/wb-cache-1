50|$|Semi-Hollow {{construction}} {{based on}} the design of the Starplayer III. A special resonating bridge construction allows to create Dobro/Resonator sounds while being able to blend it with standard magnetic pickups. The Rezobro also features an <b>adjustable</b> <b>nut</b> for slide/bottleneck use.|$|E
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} {{that frequently}} use(d) a zero fret are Gretsch, Kay, Selmer, Höfner, Mosrite, Framus, Vox, Vigier and bass guitar manufacturer MTD. Now very few manufacturers use this design {{and those who}} do list it as a feature. Steinberger uses a zero fret with their headless guitars but omit the nut; strings are mounted in place where the head would normally be, so {{there is no need for}} the string guides that the nut provides. 2015 model year Gibson guitars incorporate a zero fret in order to accommodate a brass <b>adjustable</b> <b>nut,</b> which the manufacturer claims causes better sustain and intonation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{device is}} a {{specialized}} form of external fixator, a circular fixator, modular in construction. Stainless steel (or titanium) rings are {{fixed to the}} bone via stainless heavy-gauge wire (called [...] "pins" [...] or Kirschner wires). The rings are connected to each other with threaded rods attached through <b>adjustable</b> <b>nuts.</b> The circular construction and tensioned wires of the Ilizarov apparatus provide far more structural support than the traditional monolateral fixator system. This allows early weightbearing.|$|R
50|$|Other, simpler {{suspension}} systems, such as coilover springs, offer {{a way of}} manually adjusting {{ride height}} (and often, spring stiffness) by compressing the spring in situ, using a threaded shaft and <b>adjustable</b> knob or <b>nut.</b>|$|R
50|$|The risk of firemen {{tying down}} the safety valve remained. This was {{encouraged}} by them being fitted with easily <b>adjustable</b> wing <b>nuts,</b> the practice of adjusting the boiler's working pressure via the safety valve being an accepted behaviour well into the 1850s. It was later common with Salter valves {{for them to be}} fitted in pairs, one adjustable and often calibrated for use as a gauge, the other sealed inside a locked cover to prevent tampering.|$|R
50|$|The System I bridge {{string height}} is set by {{adjustable}} pivot post screws {{and has no}} individual string height adjustments but has individual string intonation adjustments and {{is very much like}} the Gibson Tune-o-matic bridge in terms of intonation and string height adjustments.The System I tremolo system uses a behind the nut string locking mechanism.The System II and System III bridges have individual string height and individual string intonation adjustments.The System II and III tremolo systems use a height <b>adjustable</b> locking <b>nut.</b>|$|R
50|$|Initially {{produced}} from 1992 onwards the first Corvette models were called Corvette Proline and made in Germany. Later these configurations became the Corvette Standard. The early versions had strap locks that were recessed {{into the body}} and two strap locks on the bridge side of the body. The picture below shows a 5-String Corvette Proline (Ser.: G 000122 92) from 1992 (according to Warwick) with Wenge neck and fingerboard combined with a 2-piece ash body and passive electronics with MEC pickups. It features bronze frets and an <b>adjustable</b> brass <b>nut.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On set-neck {{electrics}} [...] - [...] under a cover-plate {{behind the}} nut. Gibson & Epiphone guitars have their truss rod bolt {{covered with a}} signature bell-shaped plate. Most Gibson electrics have a 5/16” (8 mm) or a 1/4" [...] (6 mm) hex <b>adjustable</b> truss rod <b>nut</b> that can be adjusted with a hex box spanner wrench.|$|R
40|$|The author {{designed}} a small citrus juice processing equipment that to extract juice from Satsuma Orange or Natsudaidai and deaerate and pasteurize natural single strength orange juice of those, {{and this was}} equipped at Faculty of Horticulture, Chiba University. This equipment can be operated {{at the rate of}} 150 liters per hour, and is of sanitary design and may be easily dismantled for cleaning. This equipment is arranged from three single unit, which descrived below: (1) Extractor This is designed to extract juice from all type of citrus fruits in a continuous process. Two endless wood chains are placed on a platform, retained by <b>adjustable</b> <b>nuts,</b> which allow the press to compensate for different thickness of the halved oranges. The halved oranges are carried between the two endless chains, on a lower chain and through continuous running ot the both, and here the juice is pressed from the oranges. The juice is collected in a stainless steel pan, from which it flow off to the finisher. This Extractors 2 ̆ 7 specification is as follow: Floor space 1. 550 m× 0. 510 m Over all height 1. 20 m Horse power 1 HP. Capacity per hour (approx.) 375 kg Pulley speed per minute upper endless wood chain 5 R. P. M lower endless wood chain 4 R. P. M (2) Deaerator The Deaerator is a stainless steel cylindrical vessel and contain an inner perforated cylinder, designed to spread the juice in the form of thin films and so increase the surface area exposed to vacuum. A vacuum pump is located at the point of connecting the deaeration chamber and the fram trap vessel, and provides a very high vacuum in the deaeration chamber. The raw juice is supplied into a deaeration chamber by vacuum suction, then the deaerated juice drops down into the downward storage tank, and is carried by the gear pump to the Flash Pasteurizer and the Cooler under atmospheric pressure. (3) Flash Pasteurizer and Cooler The Flash Pasteurizer was adopted from tubular heat exchanger type. The 8 stainless steel tubes, each, are placed in the cylindrical vessel and extend through en...|$|R
5000|$|For over {{a century}} Gibson went {{to the ends of}} the Earth and into the deepest forests to obtain the finest wood on the planet to hand make their instruments. Generations of luthiers carried on the skills of their trade. As the guitar {{industry}} underwent the change to mass production more guitars were produced cheaper. The demand for old growth trees for premium specialty wood increased rapidly. Restoring a fine classic instrument to new, or better than new condition is by far a better environmental choice than buying a new guitar. Collectors want to keep their guitars as close to original as possible, however there are some popular modifications Victory owners have made without damaging the instrument. Change out those nylon inserts, they dampen sustain, Victories were engineered to ring like a bell. Look in to a Stetsbar tremolo system if your Victory does not have the original Kahler tremolo system. The Stetsbar tremolo system bolts right on to the original posts without any routing or drilling. Consider locking machine heads with automatic string trim, they are easy to do yourself and they keep your guitar in tune even better. If the frets on your Victory are worn out, have a luther re-fret your fret board with stainless steel fret wire, the frets will last forever and you will never find better ebony. Do you want more control over string height on your Victory? Install a string height <b>adjustable</b> brass <b>nut,</b> especially if you like to play slide and fret at the same time - you can get your string height perfect. Victories were built tough and stiff to easily handle the high tension of using much heavier string gauges for slide without fret buzz and without tuning down. Let those big ol' cables ring! Keep all of your original parts in a safe place. Exact match paint for your Victory can now be mixed with the use of a hand held [...] "Spectrophotometer" [...] at your local auto paint supply, just bring it in.|$|R
