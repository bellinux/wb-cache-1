Input questions are mostly {{generated by a}} small size of text in the cQA services, and test inputs consist of only a question whereas training data do a pair of question and answer. Thus, the input questions cannot provide enough information for good classification in many cases. To solve this problem, we propose the question expanding method by pseudo relevant feedback and <b>automatic</b> <b>answer</b> generation. For pseudo relevant feedback, we first find relevant question-answer pairs related to an input question using the Indri search engine, and then top relevant words are chosen as expanded words. The <b>automatic</b> <b>answer</b> generation tries to create pseudo answers by adding question-related words using translation probabilities from questions to answers by Giza++. As a result, we obtain the significant improved performances when two approaches are effectively combined...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{address the problem of}} <b>automatic</b> <b>answer</b> {{checking}} in interactive learning systems that support mathematical notation. This problem consists of the problem of establishing identities in formal mathematical systems and hence is formally unsolvable. However, {{there is a way to}} cope with the issue. We suggest to reinforce the standard algorithm for function comparison with an additional pointwise checking procedure. An error might appear in this case. The article provides a detailed analysis of the probability of this error. It appears that the error probability is extremely low in most common cases. Generally speaking, this means that such an additional checking procedure can be quite successfully used in order to support standard algorithms for functions comparison. The results, obtained in this article, help avoiding some sudden effects of the identity problem, and provide a way to estimate the reliability of answer checking procedure in interactive learning systems.

40|$|Abstract: Adaptive E-Learning {{systems are}} needed to {{efficiently}} support lifelong learning activities. To check goal attainment, learners need to take tests or assessment activities. Large efficiency gains may be made if the assessment and associated grading or evaluation process could be supported with adaptive systems sensitive to user parameters. Hand made tests are a timeconsuming and tiresome task. If the tests are hand scored there is the inevitability of either interrupting the learning whilst the assessment outcome is pending, or the danger of proceeding with the attempt at learning possibly unsuitable content. As a contribution to solving the problem stated {{so far we have}} designed the E-TESTER. In this paper we describe the implementation solution and its integration into the AdeLE system, point out the potential of the E-TESTER by an application example, and discuss the experiences of the prototype implementation.

40|$|Short answer {{questions}} for reading comprehension {{are a common}} task in foreign language learning. Automatic short answer scoring is the task of automatically assessing the semantic content of a student’s answer, marking it e. g. as correct or incorrect. While previous approaches mainly focused on comparing a learner answer to some reference answer provided by the teacher, we explore {{the use of the}} underlying reading texts as additional evidence for the classification. First, we conduct a corpus study targeting the links between sentences in reading texts for learners of German and answers to reading comprehension questions based on those texts. Second, we use the reading text directly for classification, considering three different models: an answer-based classifier extended with textual features, a simple text-based classifier, and a model that combines the two according to confidence of the text-based classification. The most promising approach is the first one, results for which show that textual features improve classification accuracy. While the other two models do not improve classification accuracy, they do investigate the role of the text and suggest possibilities for developing <b>automatic</b> <b>answer</b> scoring systems with less supervision needed from instructors. ...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{observers}} tend {{to simplify}} the complex process of textual transmission and imagine that in a manuscript culture texts were handed down by scribes copying manuscripts {{in a long line}} of succession extending for generations. It is less commonly recognized, however, that manuscript copies were also routinely made from non-handwritten material, such as printed works or stone inscriptions. This paper looks at dated copies of stele inscriptions among the Dunhuang manuscripts, in an attempt to demonstrate the inherent difficulties in dating and establishing provenance for such copies. One of the main questions is whether the date in the colophon refers to the time when the text was carved into stone or the moment of creating the manuscript copy. The analysis reveals that there is no <b>automatic</b> <b>answer</b> to this problem, and the decision has to be made on a case-by-case basis. An additional lesson is that in many cases manuscripts are composite objects the components of which had a history of their own. The panels comprising a typical scroll often came from different locations and were written decades or more apart. It is through analyzing the interrelation of the texts and panels that we begin to uncover the complex process of the manuscript’s creation and the different layers of time and locations...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a scoring procedure to automatically classify lay requests to an internet medical forum about involuntary childlessness. The requests should be classified {{according to their}} subject matter (32 categories) and the sender’s expectation (6 categories). Building upon this procedure, the experts ’ answers to former requests could {{be the basis of}} an <b>automatic</b> <b>answer</b> for new incoming requests, finding their “nearest neighbors”. Our text mining approach comprised the following steps: a large start list of relevant words and the calculation of the Cramer’s V statistic for the association between relevant words and the 38 categories. We trained logistic regression models with high precision and recall. We then simulated a scenario in which a subset of requests (n= 50) served as ‘new ’ requests. To find the most nearest neighbors, we applied a formula, which gave high weight to singular value decompositions (SVDs) but also considered the automatically classified subject matter of this ‘new ’ request and—to a lesser degree—the sender’s expectation. If we can implement this procedure into the real life of a health internet forum, the workload of medical experts could be lightened, visitors to a forum could receive a more timely answer to their question and they could become aware of former questions and answers that were rather similar to the one they had sent...|$|E

40|$|The human {{resource}} {{perspective of a}} business process {{is concerned with the}} relation between the activities of a process and the actors who take part in them. Unlike other process perspectives, such as control flow, for which many different types of analyses have been proposed, such as finding deadlocks, there is an important gap regarding the {{human resource}} perspective. Resource analysis in business processes has not been defined, and only a few analysis operations can be glimpsed in previous approaches. In this paper, we identify and formally define seven design-time analysis operations related to how resources are involved in process activities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that {{for a wide variety of}} resource-aware BP models, those analysis operations can be automated by leveraging Description Logic (DL) off-the-shelf reasoners. To this end, we rely on Resource Assignment Language (RAL), a domain-specific language that enables the definition of conditions to select the candidates to participate in a process activity. We provide a complete formal semantics for RAL based on DLs and extend it to address the operations, for which the control flow of the process must also be taken into consideration. A proof-of-concept implementation has been developed and integrated in a system called CRISTAL. As a result, we can give an <b>automatic</b> <b>answer</b> to different questions related to the management of resources in business processes at design time...|$|E
40|$|International audienceParticipation in {{strategic}} and non-strategic games is mostly {{explained in the}} literature by gender: men gamble on strategic games, while women gamble on non-strategic games. However, {{little is known about}} the underlying cognitive factors that could also distinguish strategic and non-strategic gamblers. We suggest that cognitive style and need for cognition also explain participation in gambling subtypes. From a dualprocess perspective, cognitive style is the tendency to reject or accept the fast, <b>automatic</b> <b>answer</b> that comes immediately in response to a problem. Individuals that preferentially reject the automatic response use an analytic style, which suggest processing information in a slow way, with deep treatment. The intuitive style supposes a reliance on fast, automatic answers. The need for cognition provides a motivation to engage in effortful activities. One hundred and forty-nine gamblers (53 strategic and 96 non-strategic) answered the Cognitive Reflection Test, Need For Cognition Scale, and socio-demographic questions. A logistic regression was conducted to evaluate the influence of gender, cognitive style and need for cognition on participation {{in strategic}} and non-strategic games. Our results show that a model with both gender and cognitive variables is more accurate than a model with gender alone. Analytic (vs. intuitive) style, high (vs. low) need for cognition and being male (vs. female) are characteristics of strategic gamblers (vs. non-strategic gamblers). This study highlights the importance of considering the cognitive characteristics of strategic and non-strategic gamblers in order to develop preventive campaigns and treatments that fit the best profiles for gamblers...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop a system to allow students from various tertiary educational institutions, taking similar courses, to share common discussion forums. This was seen as important to enable larger communities of learners which could help each other, encourage discussion and give exposure to a more diverse range of opinions. In general to create a system that would make it easier to find knowledge in large networks of information and people. For this purpose a special discussion forum system was developed that can easily be integrated with institutions existing software systems for course management. The system handles the inter-institutional communications transparently, and was developed to be flexible in how it can be installed on various server configurations. The special features of the system allow students to specify the type of message they are contributing, and the system then uses this information to adapt the user interface. For instance, when a question is added, the system searches for possible answers in the existing knowledge base and displays them. An evaluation of the system in three tertiary educational institutions in New Zealand showed positive feedback from students, indicating they would use a system like this if it was made available to them in their future studies. An evaluation among teachers also showed a generally positive response. In the evaluation of the system's <b>automatic</b> <b>answer</b> finding capabilities, it was identified that this functionality should be improved to increase the effectiveness of how the system identified and highlighted possible answers...|$|E

40|$|Visual {{question}} answering (VQA) is challenging {{because it requires}} a simultaneous understanding of both visual content of images and textual content of questions. To support the VQA task, {{we need to find}} good solutions for the following three issues: 1) fine-grained feature representations for both the image and the question; 2) multi-modal feature fusion that is able to capture the complex interactions between multi-modal features; 3) <b>automatic</b> <b>answer</b> prediction that is able to consider the complex correlations between multiple diverse answers for the same question. For fine-grained image and question representations, a `co-attention' mechanism is developed by using a deep neural network architecture to jointly learn the attentions for both the image and the question, which can allow us to reduce the irrelevant features effectively and obtain more discriminative features for image and question representations. For multi-modal feature fusion, a generalized Multi-modal Factorized High-order pooling approach (MFH) is developed to achieve more effective fusion of multi-modal features by exploiting their correlations sufficiently, which can further result in superior VQA performance as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. For answer prediction, the KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence is used as the loss function to achieve more accurate characterization of the complex correlations between multiple diverse answers with same or similar meaning, which can allow us to achieve faster convergence rate and obtain slightly better accuracy on answer prediction. A deep neural network architecture is designed to integrate all these aforementioned modules into one unified model for achieving superior VQA performance. With an ensemble of 9 models, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale VQA datasets and win the runner-up in the VQA Challenge 2017.
