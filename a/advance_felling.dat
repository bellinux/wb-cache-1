40|$|The study {{focuses on}} {{problems}} of reconstruction of Polish forests growing within {{the area of}} the harmful impact of industrial contaminations, as well as in regions dominated by industry. It presents changes in proportions of stands growing in different so-called damage zones {{at the end of the}} 20 th and beginning of the 21 st centuries. Furthermore, it characterises the surface structure of different methods of reconstruction of stands which are affected by emissions (artificial renovations, reforestation of empty areas and thinning as well as the introduction of the second floor). It points to specific preconditionings which form the basis for the decisions assigning stands damaged by industry for reconstruction and discusses basic principles of management planning with reference to final cutting and <b>advance</b> <b>felling,</b> selection of appropriate tree species and melioration treatments. It also draws attention to the link between forest damage zones determined in Poland and the current volume increment, as well as the significance of this index for stand reconstruction...|$|E
60|$|I {{knew nothing}} {{of what was going}} on {{immediately}} in front of me, save that the red line, now broken by many a gap, was before my eyes; that it <b>advanced,</b> <b>fell</b> back and <b>advanced</b> again, sending among us such a shower of bullets that the buzzing in the air was like unto a swarm of angry bees.|$|R
50|$|As the Soviets <b>advanced,</b> Orel <b>fell</b> on 4 August and I Gruppe {{was forced}} back, to Bryansk. By September the Gruppe was {{shifted to the}} {{northern}} Ukraine to support defence of Kiev.|$|R
60|$|And so the Efficient Baxter crawled on; and as {{he crawled}} his hand, <b>advancing</b> cautiously, <b>fell</b> on {{something}}--something that was not alive; something clammy and ice-cold, the touch of which filled him with a nameless horror.|$|R
60|$|Colonel Burton {{had come}} up with the reinforcement, and was forming his men to face the rising ground on the right, when both of the <b>advanced</b> {{detachments}} <b>fell</b> back upon him, and all now was confusion.|$|R
60|$|The Communists fought stubbornly here, but a corps {{was sent}} round {{to turn their}} position, and seeing their retreat threatened, they broke and fled, and the École Militaire was taken {{possession}} of without further resistance. General Cissey's division entered by the gate of Mont Rouge, where the Communists, threatened in the rear by Bruat's <b>advance,</b> <b>fell</b> back at their approach. Moving along the Boulevard Mont Rouge they came upon very strong and formidable barricades, defended by six cannon and mitrailleuses, supported by musketry fire from the houses. The position {{was so strong that}} even {{with the assistance of the}} artillery Cissey was unable to advance farther in this direction.|$|R
50|$|In the {{afternoon}} a combat combined force was transported {{to a safe}} landing zone, {{not far from the}} area of the battle, but before they could regroup and start to <b>advance,</b> night <b>fell,</b> and they had to stop.|$|R
50|$|Now Brunswick {{continued}} with their Duke {{at the head}} of the counter-attack; Friedrich Wilhelm's horse was killed, but he himself remained unhurt. However, the Captain of Rabiell, commander of the <b>advancing</b> companies, <b>fell.</b> The Blacks progressively withdrew, without having recaptured Ölper.|$|R
60|$|The echoes had not {{died away}} when a {{tremendous}} fire of musketry was opened by the Poles {{hidden behind the}} abattis. More {{than half of the}} <b>advance</b> guard <b>fell</b> under that terrible discharge, and the artillery crowded behind them fell into confusion.|$|R
60|$|Harold and Disco {{sat beside}} {{each other in}} the stern, with an armed half-caste on each side, and Yoosoof in front. Their {{thoughts}} were busy enough at first, but neither spoke to the other. As the night <b>advanced</b> both <b>fell</b> into an uneasy slumber.|$|R
50|$|General Pirch II having learned, {{upon his}} arrival at 01:00 on 28 June, with {{the vanguard of}} the Prussian I Corps at Longpré, near Villers-Cotterêts, that the latter place was not {{occupied}} by the French in any force, determined to capture the place forthwith by a surprise. The troops detached to the front on this service (the Fusilier Battalion of the 6th Regiment and the Brandenburg Dragoons), favoured by the darkness (which as yet was scarcely relieved by the approaching dawn), as also by the wood through which they <b>advanced,</b> <b>fell</b> upon a detachment that was moving by a by road through the wood, consisting of a French horse battery of fourteen guns, twenty ammunition wagons, and an escort of one hundred and fifty men.|$|R
60|$|As his {{visitors}} <b>advanced,</b> he <b>fell</b> to gossiping {{with his}} fingers: a servitor interpreting. Very curious {{to note the}} rapidity with which motion was translated into sound; and the simultaneousness with which meaning made its way through four successive channels to the mind--hand, sight, voice, and tympanum.|$|R
60|$|But though {{beaten the}} Prussians were {{by no means}} routed. They had lost the key of their position; but night came on before the combat terminated, and under cover of the {{darkness}} they fell back quietly and in good order. General Thielmann's corps on the extreme Prussian left had taken but little part in the fighting; and as the center and right of the Prussian army retreated he <b>advanced,</b> <b>fell</b> upon the French in the darkness, and for some time forced them back, thus giving time {{to the rest of the}} army to reform its ranks and recover its discipline. After having rendered great service by thus occupying the enemy Thielmann took up a position on the heights, and remained facing the French, while the other corps d'armé took post in his rear.|$|R
60|$|Further, I was too {{angry and}} it was from this bow of my anger that I loosed a shaft at a venture as to some lesson which awaited her. Perhaps certain words spoken by the dying Rezu had shaped that shaft. Or perhaps some shadow of her <b>advancing</b> fate <b>fell</b> upon me.|$|R
50|$|As the group's touring {{schedule}} was booked months in <b>advance,</b> it <b>fell</b> {{that the group}} would be performing at one of London's top theaters in Drury Lane, on Wilson's last night as a member. The event was well publicized throughout the United Kingdom and was broadcast by London's Capital Radio. The show was opened by up-and-coming singer Billy Ocean.|$|R
5|$|Although the vastly outnumbered Confederates had inflicted {{casualties}} and slowed the Union advance on Saltville, they were incapable of halting it. Finding their own path to Saltville's defenses blocked, Breckinridge {{and his men}} retreated further south, while a Union company <b>advanced.</b> Saltville <b>fell</b> to a night attack on December 2021 and the salt works were destroyed by the Union forces.|$|R
5000|$|The Rajputs {{started the}} battle with a cavalry charge which was {{personally}} lead by Rana Sanga, his cavalry with their accustomed valour, <b>advanced</b> and <b>fell</b> on the Sultans army, and {{in a short time}} put the enemy to flight. [...] "Many brave and worthy men were made martyrs and the others were scattered". The Rajputs pushed the Sultans army up to Bayana.|$|R
500|$|Reeling {{from the}} loss, UN {{planners}} hastily moved reserve {{forces to the}} southwest to repel North Korean advances. Several US infantry regiments {{as well as the}} command post of the 24th Infantry Division moved to establish new positions to prevent North Korean forces from advancing from Chinju. American forces moved to defend the city of Masan, the last key city before the North Koreans reached the perimeter. Located in the mountainous region along South Korea's southern coast, Masan was accessible by two routes from the west. Major General John H. Church, the 24th Infantry Division's commander, emplaced the 19th Infantry Regiment and the 27th Infantry Regiment in the area to defend Masan. Eventually, the 27th set up along the southern entrance while the 19th Infantry covered the north, in a pass known as [...] "The Notch," [...] southwest of Chungam-ni. The entire 19th Infantry Regiment, reeling from the fight at Chinju and attempting to hold back North Korean <b>advances,</b> <b>fell</b> back to the Notch.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} Colonel Maitland, with the {{grenadiers}} of the Sixtieth Regiment and the marines, <b>advanced</b> and <b>fell</b> upon the enemy's column, already {{shaken by the}} obstinate resistance it had encountered and by its losses by the fire from the batteries. The movement was decisive. The assailants were driven headlong from the redoubt and retreated, leaving behind them 637 of the French troops killed and wounded and 264 of the Americans.|$|R
60|$|Cornwallis, in his {{circuitous}} march, dispersed {{the light}} {{parties of the}} <b>advance,</b> but <b>fell</b> in with Lord Stirling's division, strongly posted in a woody country, and well covered by artillery judiciously disposed. A sharp skirmish ensued, when the Americans gave way and retreated to the hills {{with the loss of}} a few men and three field-pieces; while the British halted at Westfield, disappointed in the main objects of their enterprise.|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} two shots were heard away on their right, {{and two of}} the <b>advancing</b> bandits <b>fell.</b> An instant later, and Quashy bounded upon the scene with a high trumpet-shriek like a wild elephant. Pedro followed, brandishing the rifle which he had just {{discharged}} with such fatal effect. Lawrence joined them with a genuine British cheer, but their adversaries did not await the onset. They turned, fled, and speedily scattered themselves among the ruins.|$|R
500|$|Following {{the attack}} on Pozières the Australians were called upon to attack Mouquet Farm in August. All three {{divisions}} of I Anzac Corps were committed {{in an effort to}} force a breach in the German lines behind Thiepval, to the north of Pozières. The task of the initial <b>advance</b> <b>fell</b> to the 4th Division on 10 August, which had already suffered 1,000 casualties resisting the final German counter-attack, but in the ensuing battle it would lose a further three times that number as the Australians once again suffered {{at the hands of the}} German artillery, finding themselves squeezed into a frontage of less than [...] against which the Germans were able to concentrate the weight of their defence. Three more attacks were made over the course of the next three weeks as the Australians fought their way across the shell-pocked countryside to the farm, only to be forced out again shortly after by the concentration of German artillery. The other two divisions of I Anzac fared only slightly better in these attacks and at the end of the engagement, Australian casualties at Mouquet Farm totalled 6,300 men.|$|R
2500|$|On the X Corps front, {{opposite}} the 19th Reserve Division and the 17th Division in close reserve as the Eingreif division, the 5th Division attacked Polderhoek Spur {{on the right}} flank took some ground towards Gheluvelt, captured Polderhoek Chateau and several pillboxes but were forced from the chateau as dark fell. The 21st Division and four tanks crossed the swamp of the Polygonebeek and routed the German defenders, the division gaining observation to the south-east over the Reutelbeek valley, which protected the main attack on Broodseinde Ridge. The right hand brigade retreated slightly to dead ground to avoid massed machine-gun fire. The 7th Division on the left of X Corps reached its objectives at {{the eastern edge of}} the Gheluvelt Plateau against the left of RIR 93 and reserve troops of IR 93 and IR 94. The British found many dead German infantry in camouflaged shell-holes and the rest retreating rapidly down the eastern slope, except for [...] who were taken prisoner. The <b>advance</b> <b>fell</b> short of the final objective but gave a view across the Heulebeek depression to the Keiberg Spur and towards Dadizeele.|$|R

50|$|Appleby Castle {{surrendered}} to the Scots on 31 July, whereat Lambert, who was still {{hanging on to the}} flank of the Scottish <b>advance,</b> <b>fell</b> back from Barnard Castle to Richmond so as to close Wensleydale against any attempt of the invaders to march on Pontefract. All the restless energy of Langdale's horse was unable to dislodge Lambert from the passes or {{to find out what was}} behind that impenetrable cavalry screen. The crisis was now at hand. Cromwell had received the surrender of Pembroke Castle on 11 July, and had marched off, with his men unpaid, ragged and shoeless, at full speed through the Midlands. Rains and storms delayed his march, but he knew that Hamilton in the broken ground of Westmorland was still worse off. Shoes from Northampton and stockings from Coventry met him, at Nottingham, and, gathering up the local levies as he went, he made for Doncaster, where he arrived on 8 August, having gained six days in advance of the time he had allowed himself for the march. He then called up artillery from Hull, exchanged his local levies for the regulars who were besieging Pontefract, and set off to meet Lambert.|$|R
50|$|On the X Corps front, {{opposite}} the 19th Reserve Division and the 17th Division in close reserve as the Eingreif division, the 5th Division attacked Polderhoek Spur {{on the right}} flank took some ground towards Gheluvelt, captured Polderhoek Chateau and several pillboxes but were forced from the chateau as dark fell.

60|$|Gage {{ordered his}} men to fix bayonets and form in order of battle. They did so in hurry and trepidation. He would have scaled a hill on the right whence there was the severest firing. Not a platoon would quit the line of march. They were more dismayed by the yells than by the rifles of the unseen savages. The latter {{extended}} themselves along the hill and in the ravines; but their whereabouts was only known by their demoniac cries and the puffs of smoke from their rifles. The soldiers fired wherever they saw the smoke. Their officers {{tried in vain to}} restrain them until they should see their foe. All orders were unheeded; in their fright they shot at random, killing some of their own flanking parties, and of the vanguard, as they came running in. The covert fire grew more intense. In a short time most of the officers and many of the men of the advance were killed or wounded. Colonel Gage himself received a wound. The <b>advance</b> <b>fell</b> back in dismay upon Sir John St. Clair's corps, which was equally dismayed. The cannon belonging to it were deserted.|$|R

They also serve as wholesalers and distributors for several other publishers.|$|R
25|$|After an {{exchange}} of fire, Gage's <b>advance</b> group <b>fell</b> back. In the narrow confines of the road, they collided with {{the main body of}} Braddock's force, which had advanced rapidly when the shots were heard. The entire column dissolved in disorder as the Canadian militamen and Indians enveloped them and continued to snipe at the British flanks from the woods {{on the sides of the}} road. At this time, the French regulars began advancing from the road and began to push the British back.|$|R
60|$|With {{the fall}} of San Isidro, General Aguinaldo and his {{followers}} retreated to the mountains, twelve {{miles to the north}} of that town. At the same time the rebels who had been opposing General MacArthur's <b>advance</b> <b>fell</b> back to Tarlac, thirty miles beyond San Fernando. But the Americans had not sufficient troops at hand with which to garrison the many towns they had taken, and so it was not long before some of the rebels came back to one place and another, to take what they could get, and to harass those natives who had been friendly to our soldiers. In the meantime the rainy season put a stop to further activity on a large scale, and while the Filipinos sued again for peace (but upon their own terms), General Otis sent for additional troops, so that the next dry season might see the rebellion brought to such a finish that its resurrection would be an impossibility. Many Americans pitied the sad condition of the Tagalogs, but all felt that as matters were now situated the supremacy of the United States throughout the Philippines must be maintained. Once the insurgents submitted to American authority, we would do the very best we could by them.|$|R
60|$|On {{the stream}} at this part stood {{the village of}} Unterglau, having a stone bridge across the Nebel. This was but weakly held by the French, who, upon seeing the allies {{advancing}} at full speed, fired the village to check the <b>advance,</b> and then <b>fell</b> back.|$|R
60|$|The {{movement}} was steadily executed, the wounded men being carried {{with them as}} they retired. The tribesmen <b>advanced</b> as they <b>fell</b> back--not venturing to press them, however; for the rear guard kept their faces towards them, and any who ventured to show themselves instantly paid the penalty of their rashness.|$|R
50|$|Belize won {{its opening}} match in the Centrobasquet Tournament, {{defeating}} Trinidad and Tobago, but lost badly to Mexico in a rematch of the COCABA final. A tough win over Cuba set Belize {{in a position}} to <b>advance,</b> but they <b>fell</b> to Puerto Rico in their final match and failed to qualify.|$|R
25|$|In the south-east, the Wehrmacht {{headed in}} the {{direction}} of Grozny and Baku, the other important petroleum centres. More installations and industrial centres fell into German hands, many intact or only slightly damaged during the Russian retreat. From August–September, the Taman Peninsula and a part of the Novorossiysk naval base were captured. The Germans continued towards Tuapse on the Black Sea coast and in the east Elista was taken on 13 August. In the south, the German advance was stopped north of Grozny, after taking Mozdok on 25 August. German paratroopers assisted an insurgency in Chechnya, operating behind Soviet lines. German mountain troops failed to secure the Black Sea ports and the <b>advance</b> <b>fell</b> short of Grozny as supply difficulties arose once more. The Soviets dug in the 9th and 44th armies of the North Transcaucasian Front along the rocky Terek River bank in front (north) of the city. The Luftwaffe was unable to support the German army that far forward and Soviet aviation attacked bridges and supply routes virtually unopposed. The Germans crossed the river on 2 September but made only slow progress. At the beginning of September, Hitler had a major argument with the High Command and specifically List, as he perceived the advance of the German forces as too slow. As a result Hitler dismissed List on 9 September and took direct command of Army Group A himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "When the {{advanced}} party reached about halfway up this spur, it was fired on from a sangar {{which had been}} built across the road and, at the same time, men appeared on all the mountain tops and ridges, and stones were rolled down all the shoots. Captain Ross, who was with the <b>advanced</b> guard, <b>fell</b> back on the main body. All the coolies dropped their loads and bolted, {{as soon as the}} first shot was fired. Captain Ross, after looking at the enemy's position, decided to fall back upon Koragh; as it would have been useless to go on to Reshun, leaving an enemy in such a position behind us." ...|$|R
50|$|The North Carolina Continentals {{halted the}} British <b>advance,</b> but <b>fell</b> {{back with a}} British bayonet charge, only to reform and halt the British a second time. Greene then ordered the Maryland and Virginia Continentals forward in another passage of lines, forcing the British back towards their camp. However, two areas of British {{resistance}} remained, one under Maj. Henry Sheridan at the Brick House, which include a swivel gun, and another under Maj. Marjoribanks on the northern flank. Washington's cavalry tried to dislodge Marjoribanks, but Washington was unhorsed, wounded and taken prisoner, sitting out {{the remainder of the}} war. Marjoribanks then retreated towards the Brick House.|$|R
