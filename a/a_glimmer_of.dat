Journalist Kate Cavanaugh wrote that Judds' inability to love and cherish Shiloh is borne because of the love his family nurtured in him.|$|E

In the second match against Germany, again he was a substitute, but came on for Dutch captain Mark van Bommel and took the captain's armband. In the second half he created more attacking chances, which led to a goal, but they again lost the match. In the final group match against Portugal, Van der Vaart started as captain, and scored a goal that gave the Netherlands <b>a</b> <b>glimmer</b> <b>of</b> hope {{to get out of the}} group. However, two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo gave Portugal a 2–1 win and knocked out the Netherlands.|$|E

25|$|A disciplined bowling and fielding effort, conceding {{only five}} extras, {{was the key}} to Leicestershire Foxes' win at Grace Road. Nottinghamshire Outlaws won the toss and batted first, but after Nottinghamshire skipper Stephen Fleming found four {{boundaries}} in his twelve-ball 24, Jeremy Snape and Dinesh Mongia tied down the Nottinghamshire batsmen. Only Leicestershire seamer Darren Maddy, who bowled two overs for 33, gave the visitors' total score of 143 for 8 <b>a</b> <b>glimmer</b> <b>of</b> respect. The chase was close and exciting, however, as Leicestershire lost HD Ackerman and Maddy in succession to go to 16 for 2. At 103 for 5, things looked grim, but a crucial partnership between Paul Nixon and Ottis Gibson won them the game with four balls to spare.|$|E
25|$|Mumbai {{failed to}} carry the {{momentum}} in the Federation Cup as they got knocked out in the Group stage itself. The club were pit in Group A alongside Dempo SC, East Bengal, Sporting Clube de Goa and Royal Wahingdoh. All group stage games were played at Fatorda Stadium, Goa. The team lost their first game 2–1 against newbies Royal Wahingdoh with Josimar scoring the consolation goal in the game. A solitary Samapth Kutty Mani goal in the 1–0 win against Sporting Goa gave Mumbai <b>a</b> <b>glimmer</b> <b>of</b> hope {{to qualify for the}} semi-finals. In the next game against East Bengal unfortunately ended in a 0–0 draw. Mumbai's inability to finish their chances cost them a win although the draw left them top of the Group. The last game against Dempo ended in a 2–0 defeat for Mumbai which knocked Mumbai out of the Federation Cup.|$|E
25|$|Portugal and the Netherlands {{faced each}} other in the first semi-final. Cristiano Ronaldo put the hosts in the lead from a corner kick midway through the first half, and just before the hour mark Maniche made it 2–0 for Portugal with a {{spectacular}} goal from the corner of the penalty area. An own goal from Jorge Andrade gave the Netherlands <b>a</b> <b>glimmer</b> <b>of</b> hope. Portugal came close to scoring a third goal that was only stopped by Wilfred Bouma's blocking attempt. The game ended 2–1 to Portugal and the hosts, after their opening day failure, were through to the final of their European Championship. The Czech Republic looked likely candidates to face the hosts in the final. They were favorites to take the trophy, having won all four games. However, they would have to see off the upstart Greeks to do so. The Czechs had several chances, including a shot from Tomáš Rosický that struck the bar. The game remained goalless, until the dying moments {{of the first half of}} extra-time, when Traianos Dellas headed home the winner, the first and only silver goal in a European Championship.|$|E

25|$|In {{the series}} Astonishing X-Men, a {{flashback}} shows that Frost's {{survival of the}} destruction of Genosha was due to Cassandra Nova creating Frost's secondary mutation as part of a scheme to infiltrate the X-Men as a sleeper agent. A guilt ridden Frost creates psychic manifestations of a new Hellfire Club and proceeds to take down the X-Men one by one by showing them their deepest fears. Later on it is revealed that Frost's survivor's guilt is being exacerbated by Cassandra Nova who had placed <b>a</b> <b>glimmer</b> <b>of</b> her mind in Frost's before being trapped in the body of Stuff, and that Nova had even tricked Frost into thinking that she had been complicit in the destruction of Genosha. Kitty with aid from Cyclops, Blindfold, Hisako Ichiki, and Frost herself eventually prevent Nova from transferring her mind into Hisako. Everyone present is then suddenly teleported onto a S.W.O.R.D. ship headed towards the Breakworld. The arc concludes with Kitty trapped in the bullet heading towards Earth and the team trying to find various ways to save the Earth and save Kitty. Frost keeps in telepathic contact with Kitty, trying to reassure her, even offering to psionically sedate her. Kitty sacrifices herself, phasing the bullet through Earth. In the aftermath, the X-Men are uncertain of Kitty's fate, believing her to either be dead or at least phased into part of the runaway bullet. Frost is devastated.|$|E
25|$|Adam Gilchrist, Simon Katich and Shane Warne all {{played a}} part in getting Australia past 100, with their scores in the 20s, but Harmison – coming back for a second spell – wrapped them up with {{variations}} in length along with his ever-reliant pace. He finished with five for 43, allowing Glenn McGrath to be stranded on 10 not out, and McGrath was to take centre stage when England batted. They survived six overs until tea, scoring ten runs, but McGrath, who bowled his usual accurate line and length and got the odd ball to move, reaped massive rewards. Marcus Trescothick fell first ball after tea, edging to slip, and Strauss fell in similar fashion three balls later. Michael Vaughan and Ian Bell were shaken up, but survived six overs – before McGrath started the torture again. They were both bowled, as was Andrew Flintoff, and England had lost five wickets for 21 runs, with five of their front line batsmen out in single figures. However, Kevin Pietersen and Geraint Jones gave England <b>a</b> <b>glimmer</b> <b>of</b> hope, pairing up for 58 before Brett Lee's reverse-swing with the old ball induced a backward edge off Jones' bat to Adam Gilchrist. Ashley Giles hit two quick boundaries, but a short pacy ball from Lee undid him, and England were 92 for 7 overnight – needing 98 for the last three wickets to get level with Australia.|$|E
25|$|Botham {{continued}} to play for England under Brearley and achieved the highpoint {{of his career in}} the next three Tests as England recovered to win The Ashes. In the third Test at Headingley, Australia opened with 401 for 9 declared, despite good bowling by Botham who took 6 for 95. England responded poorly and were dismissed for 174. Botham was the only batsman to perform at all well and scored 50, which was his first Test half-century since he had been awarded the captaincy thirteen Tests earlier. Having been forced to follow-on, England collapsed again and at 135 for 7 on the afternoon of the fourth day, an innings defeat looked certain. Bookmakers had reportedly been offering odds of 500/1 against an England win after the follow-on was enforced. Botham, himself not long at the wicket, was the remaining recognised batsman as he was joined by the fast bowler Graham Dilley, number nine in the batting order, with only Chris Old and Bob Willis to come. With able support from Dilley (56) and Old (29), Botham hit out and by the close of play was 145 not out with Willis hanging on at the other end on 1 not out. England's lead was just 124 but there remained <b>a</b> <b>glimmer</b> <b>of</b> hope. On the final day's play, there was time for four more runs from Botham before Willis was out and Botham was left on 149 not out. Australia, with plenty of time remaining, needed 130 to win and were generally expected to get them. After Botham took the first wicket, Willis took 8 for 43 to dismiss Australia for only 111. England had won by 18 runs and it was {{only the second time in}} history that a team following on had won a Test match.|$|E
