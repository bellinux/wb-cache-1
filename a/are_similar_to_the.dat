5|$|Variety longispora {{is known}} from the Pacific Northwest. It has spores that are 55–75 by 2–2.5µm, and paraphyses that <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> typical variety.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{civilian}} vessels produce sonar {{waves in}} order to measure the depth of the body of water in which they <b>are.</b> <b>Similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> navy, some boats produce waves that attract porpoises, while others may repel them. The problem with the waves that attract is that the animal may be injured or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its propeller.|$|E
5|$|All of Neptune's inner moons {{are dark}} objects: their {{geometric}} albedo ranges from 7 to 10%. Their spectra {{indicate that they}} are made from water ice contaminated by some very dark material, probably complex organic compounds. In this respect, the inner Neptunian moons <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inner Uranian moons.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> local accent <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{traditional}} dialect of Hampshire, {{featuring the}} dropping of some consonants and {{an emphasis on}} longer vowels.

50|$|The {{stimulus-response}} compatibility {{is known}} <b>to</b> also affect <b>the</b> choice reaction {{time for the}} Hick-Hyman Law. This means that <b>the</b> response should <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stimulus itself (such as turning a steering wheel <b>to</b> turn <b>the</b> wheels of the car). The action <b>the</b> user performs <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> response the driver receives from the car.|$|R
5|$|CMDCM {{insignia}} <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> insignia for Master Chief, {{except that}} the rating symbol is replaced by an inverted five-point star, reflecting a change in their rating from their previous rating (i.e., MMCM) to CMDCM. The stars for Command Master Chief are silver, while stars for Fleet or Force Master Chief are gold. Additionally, CMDCMs wear a badge, worn on their left breast pocket, denoting their title (Command/Fleet/Force).|$|E
5|$|Deposit funds <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> agency funds used {{by state}} and local governments for assets {{belonging}} to individuals and other entities, held temporarily by the government. State income taxes withheld from a federal government employee's pay, not yet paid to the state, are an example of deposit funds.|$|E
5|$|Hence in this {{variation}} Black lets White {{build his}} pawn centre only to undermine it later, a playing philosophy espoused in {{the teachings of}} the hypermodern school. The strategic themes <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ones that can be found in other openings like the Four Pawns Attack, the Alekhine Defence or the Grünfeld Defence.|$|E

5|$|Horizontal {{broaching}} machines {{are designed for}} pull broaching, surface broaching, continuous broaching, and rotary broaching. Pull style machines are basically vertical machines laid on the side with a longer stroke. Surface style machines hold the broach stationary while the workpieces are clamped into fixtures that are mounted on a conveyor system. Continuous style machines <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface style machines except adapted for internal broaching.|$|E
5|$|In {{order of}} their {{distance}} from the planet, the irregular moons are Triton, Nereid, Halimede, Sao, Laomedeia, Psamathe, and Neso, a group that includes both prograde and retrograde objects. The five outermost moons <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> irregular moons of other giant planets, and {{are thought to have}} been gravitationally captured by Neptune, unlike the regular satellites, which probably formed in situ.|$|E
5|$|M. l. rogersi {{occurs in}} the Kimberleys and was {{originally}} named by Mathews in 1912. It was {{also known as the}} lavender-flanked fairywren and considered as the same taxon. Though the males <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> widely occurring inland subspecies assimilis, the females are predominantly blue-grey rather than grey-brown. A broad hybrid zone with females of both subspecies has been recorded from northeastern Western Australia and the northwestern Northern Territory.|$|E

40|$|Let A be {{the generic}} abelian crossed product {{with respect to}} Z_ 3 ×Z_ 3, in this note we show that A <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tensor product of 4 symbol algebras (3 of degree 9 and one of degree 3) and if A is of {{exponent}} 3 it <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> product of 31 symbol algebras of degree 3. We then use RS to prove that if A is any algebra of degree 9 then A <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> product of 35840 symbol algebras (8960 of degree 3 and 26880 of degree 9) and if A is of exponent 3 it <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> product of 277760 symbol algebras of degree 3. We then show that the essential 3 -dimension {{of the class of}} A is at most 6...|$|R
5|$|Public {{enterprise}} funds <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> enterprise funds used {{by state}} and local governments for business-like activities conducted primarily with the public. The Postal Service Fund {{is an example of a}} public enterprise fund.|$|E
5|$|Revolving funds <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Proprietary funds used {{by state}} and local governments for business-like activities.

5|$|Sinhala {{alphabet}} {{differs from}} other Indo-Aryan alphabets {{in that it}} contains a pair of vowel sounds (U+0DD0 and U+0DD1 in the proposed Unicode Standard) that are unique to it.

5|$|The {{classical}} objects (cubewanos) {{are very}} different from the scattered objects: more than 30% of all cubewanos are on low-inclination, near-circular orbits whose eccentricities peak at 0.25. Classical objects possess eccentricities ranging from 0.2 to 0.8. Though the inclinations of scattered objects <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> more extreme KBOs, very few scattered objects have orbits as close to the ecliptic as much of the KBO population.|$|E
5|$|The stalls and pews in the crossing, by Seddon, <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pews in {{the nave}} (being of pitch pine with pegged tenon joints) but are more ornate, with open-arcaded front kneelers and two reading desks with triple pointed arches to the fronts and {{scrolled}} tops to the uprights.|$|E
5|$|Written by Roger Dixon, this storyline {{was about}} the TARDIS being dragged beneath the sands of Terunda to {{encounter}} people descended from Earth's Neanderthal Man who wish {{to return to the}} Earth of 2016.
