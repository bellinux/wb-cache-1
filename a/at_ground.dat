5|$|<b>At</b> <b>ground</b> {{level and}} inside the lobby, bas-reliefs depict {{the origins of the}} Price company. During the 1920s John M. Lyle, an {{influential}} architect of the Beaux-arts school, was developing a uniquely Canadian fusion of French and English colonial styles, and his ideas were applied by designers Ross and Macdonald to the construction of the Price Building. Each floor is symmetrically divided in two by a hallway, and a projection {{at the end of the}} building references the bow of a ship.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>ground</b> level, the three-track Northeast Corridor {{runs through}} the station. There are two side {{platforms}}; however, Providence/Stoughton Line trains do not stop at Readville in regular service. The platforms are occasionally used during service disruptions when Fairmount Line service is not running or when trains cannot stop at Hyde Park.|$|E
50|$|After 1934, {{neighbouring}} Glamorgan, {{which had}} risen to first-class status in 1921, played fairly regularly <b>at</b> <b>grounds</b> within the Monmouthshire borders, including the county <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> Rodney Parade, Newport.|$|R

5|$|Because {{scratches}} {{dominate the}} microwear {{texture of the}} teeth, Williams et al. suggested Edmontosaurus was a grazer instead of a browser, which would be predicted to have fewer scratches due to eating less abrasive materials. Candidates for ingested abrasives include silica-rich plants like horsetails and soil that was accidentally ingested due to feeding <b>at</b> <b>ground</b> level. The tooth structure indicates combined slicing and grinding capabilities.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, one of {{the last}} monuments erected at Gettysburg National Military Park was {{dedicated}} as a belated tribute to Longstreet, an equestrian statue by sculptor Gary Casteel. He is shown riding on a depiction of his favorite horse, Hero, <b>at</b> <b>ground</b> level in a grove of trees in Pitzer Woods, unlike most generals, who are elevated on tall bases overlooking the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|In a {{visit to}} Los Alamos in September 1944, von Neumann showed that the {{pressure}} increase from explosion shock wave reflection from solid objects was greater than previously believed if the angle of incidence of the shock wave was between 90° and some limiting angle. As a result, {{it was determined that}} the effectiveness of an atomic bomb would be enhanced with detonation some kilometers above the target, rather than <b>at</b> <b>ground</b> level.|$|E

5|$|The area {{housing the}} {{machinery}} {{to drive the}} wheel {{is located in the}} final pillar of the aqueduct, and contains seven chambers connected by ladders. Access is by a door located <b>at</b> <b>ground</b> level or an entrance halfway up the tower with a gantry crane to facilitate the installation of equipment.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} had two main entrances: a main entrance <b>at</b> <b>ground</b> level that faced east onto Queen's Park Drive, and a connecting passageway from the Royal Ontario Museum from {{what used to}} be the Mineralogy Gallery. On the wall opposite from the ticket booth and coat check was an evocative quote from Dante Alighieri Divine Comedy. Admission to either facility allowed visitors to see exhibits in both buildings, though a planetarium show cost extra.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the damage meant it was not {{possible}} to determine the exact source of ignition, but possibilities include an emergency generator and the depot's fire pump system. The investigators did not believe that it was caused either by the driver of a fuel tanker, as had been speculated, or by anyone using a mobile phone. It was felt unlikely that the explosion had a widespread effect on air quality <b>at</b> <b>ground</b> level.|$|E

5|$|The plans {{called for}} a two-track station which would be {{connected}} to the surface via elevators. <b>At</b> <b>ground</b> level, {{there would have been a}} vestibule with traveller facilities and ticket sales. The main entrance was to be from Balchensgate, with a secondary entrance from the street junction Elisenbergveien–Frognerveien.|$|E

The first floor of the bay has three windows; the ground floor has two windows with a glazed door in the middle. This door is of similar design to the front door at the north of the house, and has four steps of Portland stone accompanied by balustrades also of Portland stone.|$|E

5|$|There are twenty-two {{stations}} on the network, {{of which}} nine are underground and six are deep-level. They were all designed by KHR Arkitekter, who created open stations with daylight. Stations have an information column in front, {{marked with a}} large 'M' and featuring information screens. All stations have a vestibule <b>at</b> <b>ground</b> level, which has ticket and local information, ticket machines and validators. The stations are built with island platforms and are fully accessible for people with disabilities.|$|E
5|$|As English cathedrals {{are often}} {{surrounded}} by an expanse of green lawn, the plan is usually clearly visible <b>at</b> <b>ground</b> level, {{which is not the}} case with the many European cathedrals that are closely surrounded by town or monastic buildings. The general impression is that the English cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs. These horizontal projections are visibly balanced by the strong verticals of the massive towers, which may be one, two or three in number. Many of the cathedrals, particularly those like Winchester, St. Albans and Peterborough where the towers are not particularly high, give an impression of tremendous length and have been described as resembling “aircraft carriers”.|$|E
5|$|As {{an active}} civil airfield, {{operations}} at Duxford are {{regulated by the}} Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). In 2002 a privately operated Aero L-39 Albatros suffered a braking failure on landing, overran the runway and {{came to rest on}} the M11 motorway, a student pilot being killed after ejecting <b>at</b> <b>ground</b> level. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch inquiry recommended a review of arrangements for aircraft taking off or landing towards the M11. As a result, the CAA and Duxford agreed to a reduction in the runway's 1500m declared length, from 1350m to 1200m, in order to provide a greater margin of error.|$|E
