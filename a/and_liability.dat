5|$|A {{number of}} student {{deaths in the}} late 1990s and early 2000s {{resulted}} in considerable media attention focussing on MIT's culture and student life. After the alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger in September 1997 as a new member at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, MIT began requiring all freshmen {{to live in the}} dormitory system. The 2000 suicide of MIT undergraduate Elizabeth Shin drew attention to suicides at MIT and created a controversy over whether MIT had an unusually high suicide rate. In late 2001 a task force's recommended improvements in student mental health services were implemented, including expanding staff and operating hours at the mental health center. These and later cases were significant as well because they sought to prove the negligence <b>and</b> <b>liability</b> of university administrators in loco parentis.|$|E
5|$|Sections 21–23 {{cover the}} review of agents and the {{liability}} of trustees for agents actions. Section 21 identifies that review <b>and</b> <b>liability</b> occurs when the trustees appoints agents, nominees and custodians under the Act or under similar provisions in the trust instrument. Section 22 provides a duty on trustees who delegate their powers, with the duty consisting of three elements. Firstly, trustees are required {{to make sure that}} agent is suitable for the job he is employed to do. Secondly, they are required to consider whether or not to intervene in the appointment if circumstances demand it. Thirdly, trustees are required to intervene after appointment if the circumstances demand it. Section 23 establishes trustees' liability for the actions of agents; a trustee is liable for negligence if he violates the general duty of care set out in Section 1, but not otherwise.|$|E

40|$|There is {{an absence}} of {{research}} addressing {{the process by which}} emotional (also called sensational) assets <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> interact with the intellectual and accounting assets <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> of a firm. This conceptual paper discusses the relationship between these types of assets <b>and</b> <b>liabilities,</b> <b>and</b> examines the way in which emotional assets <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> (emotional capital) influence the fair value, profits and cash flow of a firm. It outlines how the core emotions related to products and services can influence customers in making purchasing decisions that maximise the value of a firm. It also offers indicators for the managing and reporting of emotional assets and reviews several theories that attempt to explain the relationship between the emotional assets <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> <b>and</b> value of a firm...|$|R
50|$|The {{financial}} account shows the acquisition {{and disposal of}} financial assets <b>and</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Examples of financial assets include: bank deposits (which are assets of the depositors <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> of the banks), unit trust units (assets of the holders <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> of unit trusts), and Treasury Bills (assets of the holders <b>and</b> a <b>liability</b> of central government).

40|$|The {{overseas}} assets <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> of UK banks {{account for}} over 50 % of the overseas assets <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> of all UK residents and almost 50 % of UK banks' total assets <b>and</b> <b>liabilities.</b> They are {{much larger than}} the overseas assets of banks in other developed countries. This paper adopts an institutional, theoretical and empirical approach to explain the large size of these overseas assets. We find that over 80 % of these assets <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> are accounted for by foreign-owned UK banks and their large size may be traced {{to the development of the}} Euro-currency markets in London in the late 1950 s and 1960 s. Although net overseas bank assets can, in principle, be explained, the gross assets are more problematic. The theoretical literature is quite limited and the most appropriate macroeconomic framework would be complex and difficult to apply. We therefore examine some simpler empirical hypotheses about the size of these assets <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> but find that they are rejected by the data. We conclude that while an institutional and theoretical approach reveals the nature of UK banks' overseas assets <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> <b>and</b> suggests some of their determinants, developing a satisfactory empirical model is quite difficult. UK banks, overseas assets <b>and</b> <b>liabilities,</b> foreign-owned, euro- currency markets. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the actual}} study, {{starting}} from the international experience, we revealed the role that should {{be taken by the}} Assets <b>and</b> <b>Liabilities</b> Committee (ALCO) within the Romanian commercial banks. ALCO became one of the tools used by the executive management of the banks to take decisions regarding the future policy of assets <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> management, relying on the synthetic information prepared by well trained technicians but without voting right (usually middle management staff). We consider that the implementation of an assets <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> management strategy cannot be done without an appropriate corporate governance structure, even though the bank is having highly specialized staff.

25|$|Some {{concerns}} {{have been raised}} about a recovery approach in theory and in practice. These include suggestions that it: is an old concept; only happens to very few people; represents an irresponsible fad; happens only {{as a result of}} active treatment; implies a cure; can only be implemented with new resources; adds to the burden of already stretched providers; is neither reimbursable nor evidence based; devalues the role of professional intervention; and increases providers' exposure to risk <b>and</b> <b>liability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{accepted}} {{that there is a}} third category, restitutionary obligations, based on the unjust enrichment of the defendant at the plaintiff's expense. Contractual liability, reflecting the constitutive function of contract, is generally for failing to make things better (by not rendering the expected performance), liability in tort is generally for action (as opposed to omission) making things worse, <b>and</b> <b>liability</b> in restitution is for unjustly taking or retaining the benefit of the plaintiff's money or work.|$|E

25|$|Keenly {{aware of}} the {{potential}} for bad press <b>and</b> <b>liability,</b> University administrators have used a variety of techniques to moderate negative behaviors.

Undergraduate members, alumni advisors, national fraternities and University administration regularly collaborate on the shared goal of reducing risks. Self-policing by peer moderators and the incorporation of live-in adult mentors have been important tools in addressing this goal.|$|E

25|$|A famous puzzle {{in human}} {{genetics}} is the genetic ability to taste phenylthiocarbamide (phenylthiourea or PTC), a morphism which {{was discovered in}} 1931. This substance, which to some of us is bitter, and to others tasteless, is of no great significance in itself, yet it is a genetic dimorphism. Because of its high frequency (which varies in different ethnic groups) it must be connected to some function of selective value. The ability to taste PTC itself is correlated {{with the ability to}} taste other bitter substances, many of which are toxic. Indeed, PTC itself is toxic, though not at the level of tasting it on litmus. Variation in PTC perception may reflect variation in dietary preferences throughout human evolution, and might correlate with susceptibility to diet-related diseases in modern populations. There is a statistical correlation between PTC tasting <b>and</b> <b>liability</b> to thyroid disease.|$|E
