2500|$|There are 10 {{recorded}} {{species of}} mammals inhabiting the Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area. The <b>Asian</b> <b>Small-Clawed</b> <b>Otter</b> (Aonyx cinerea) [...] and the Smooth-coated Otter (Lutra perspicillata) are {{both on the}} IUCN Red List as Vulnerable species and Fishing Cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) is presently listed as Endangered. Aonyx cinerea are considered ‘bioindicators’ of wetland ecosystems, therefore declining populations within Thale Noi are concerning and indicates deteriorating ecological conditions that threatens the biodiversity of the entire ecosystem. The most significant threat to these species are the loss of habitat and population fragmentation due to land conversion into rice paddies and shrimp farms (Mukherjees et al. 2010). [...] Over-fishing and trapping may {{also contribute to the}} declining Fishing Cat population in the region, due to a reduction of food availability and increased risk of being killed by farmers protecting their stock or being sold in the illegal pet trade. A recent study in 2013 [...] found that Fishing Cats in the Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area were almost completely nocturnal, making recording individual numbers difficult to establish.|$|E
40|$|Little {{research}} has been conducted on cognitive abilities in <b>Asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otters</b> (Aonyx cinereus) despite behavioral and social characteristics which suggest that this species would perform well on cognitive tasks and are likely to provide relevant data for comparison to other taxa. <b>Asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otters</b> are relatively long-lived and have complex social systems that t involve cooperative breeding, paternal care and reproductive suppression. These life-history characteristics have been associated with highly intelligent behavior, yet {{little is known about the}} cognitive abilities of this species. The current study explored spatial memory in <b>Asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otters</b> using a modification of the radial arm maze. Performance on all measures improved significantly across sessions. These results provide evidence that <b>Asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otters</b> have spatial memory for food locations and illustrate the potential for cognitive testing with this species...|$|R

50|$|This {{species was}} {{originally}} {{described as the}} only member of the genus Amblonyx, but was transferred to the genus Aonyx after mitochondrial DNA analysis.

50|$|One of {{the largest}} <b>Asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otter</b> {{exhibits}} is at Zoo Basel. There, the outdoor otter exhibit is about 2000 m2 and has two rivers, four ponds, and over a dozen tunnels. Only one family of otters is living in this enclosure and it is shared by Indian rhinoceroses and muntjacs. The otters get along very well with the other animals and are often seen swimming with the rhinos.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{to other}} otters, Asian small-clawed otters have {{relatively}} short legs, {{which are used}} to swim, walk, groom and manipulate prey. Feet are very narrow and only webbed to the last joint, a feature which distinguishes the <b>Asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otter</b> from all other species of otter. These partially webbed paws give them an excellent sense of touch and coordination, providing them with more dexterity than other otters with full webbing. Unlike other otters, they catch their prey with their paws instead of with their mouth. Their small, blunt, peg-like claws are extremely reduced and rarely extend past {{the tips of the}} digits.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otter</b> (Aonyx cinerea syn. Amblonyx cinereus), {{also known}} as the oriental small-clawed otter or simply small-clawed otter, is a semiaquatic mammal native to South and Southeast Asia. It {{is a member of the}} otter {{subfamily}} (Lutrinae) of the weasel family (Mustelidae), and is the smallest otter species in the world. Its paws are a distinctive feature; its claws do not extend beyond the fleshy end pads of its partially webbed fingers and toes. This gives it a high degree of manual dexterity so that it can use its paws to feed on molluscs, crabs and other small aquatic animals.|$|E

50|$|Otters have long, slim {{bodies and}} {{relatively}} short limbs. Their most striking anatomical features are the powerful webbed feet used to swim, and their seal-like abilities holding breath underwater. Most have sharp claws {{on their feet}} and all except the sea otter have long, muscular tails. The 13 species range in adult size from 0.6 to 1.8 m in length and 1 to 45 kg in weight. The <b>Asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otter</b> is the smallest otter species and the giant otter and sea otter are the largest. They have very soft, insulated underfur, which is protected by an outer layer of long guard hairs. This traps a layer of air which keeps them dry, warm, and somewhat buoyant under water.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otter</b> ranges {{in coastal}} regions from {{southern}} India to Southeast Asia including {{the islands of}} Sumatra, Java, Borneo and Palawan. It inhabits freshwater wetland systems such as swamps, meandering rivers, mangroves and tidal pools as well as irrigated rice fields. It prefers pond areas and rice fields over rivers with bare banks, but dislikes bare and open areas that do not offer any shelter. It wanders between patches of reeds and river debris where many crab species {{are likely to be}} found. In the riverine systems it chooses areas with low vegetation, and dugs nesting burrows into muddy banks. It spends most of its time on land unlike most other otters.|$|E
50|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otters</b> are diurnal animals (active {{during the}} day), found in remote areas, free of human disturbance. However, some {{have adapted to}} life near villages. They {{continually}} groom their fur to maintain its insulating qualities. <b>Asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otters</b> are excellent swimmers; they swim by moving their hind legs and tail. They ‘dog-paddle’ with all four feet while swimming or floating. When swimming at a high speed, they undulate their entire bodies, including their tails, up and down while their hind feet steer. They can dive under water for about six to eight minutes. Usually after swimming or feeding, this species will rub themselves against logs and vegetation around their territory {{so that they can}} leave their scent. This is called 'scent marking'. They also produce small amounts of feces, known as spraint. The spraints are important for communication among the otters; those with different smells and appearance indicate the presence of strangers. Generally, the otters sleep and rest on land either above ground or in their dens. They often sleep in areas with moderate disturbance. <b>Asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otters</b> are mostly social animals. They live in extended family groups of about 12 individuals. They are often seen playing (which can be seen at zoos) and sliding on muddy banks and in the water in regions where they frequently visit or live. They defend their territories by working, scratching and occasionally fighting.|$|R
40|$|Between 1996 and 1998, 477 dead otters from {{different}} Central European countries were examined for urolithiasis, including 449 free-ranging Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) {{as well as}} 17 Eurasian <b>otters</b> and 11 <b>Asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otters</b> (Aonyx cinerea) from captivity. In the free-ranging specimens, uroliths (sand or stones) were found in 105 animals (23. 4 %), with no significant difference (P = 0. 77) between the sexes. Uroliths were not present in any juveniles (n = 26) and urolithiasis was not considered {{the main cause of}} death in any individual. In captive specimens, uroliths were found in 11 out of 17 Eurasian otters (64. 7 %; four males and seven females), and in 3 out of 11 <b>Asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otters</b> (27. 3 %). Histology could not find any signs of inflammation in examined kidneys (n = 179) or urinary bladders (n = 66). Analyzed stones of free-ranging and captive Eurasian otters were composed mainly of ammonium acid urate. The stones of three captive <b>Asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otters</b> consisted mainly of calcium oxalate. The difference in prevalence of uroliths between free-ranging and captive Eurasian otters was significant (P = 0. 001). Nevertheless, the prevalence in free-ranging specimens of this study is higher than reported before. Differences between various habitats, environmental changes, and genetic predisposition all represent potential hypothetical explanations for these findings...|$|R

40|$|Education and {{breeding}} become {{main reasons for}} <b>asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otter</b> placement as display animal in zoo. Proper management is needed to maintain <b>asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otter</b> welfare. This research objectives were to examine and assess <b>asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otter</b> welfare in three Indonesia zoos. The study was conducted from December 2016 to February 2017 in Bandung Zoo, Ragunan Zoo and Ocean Dream Samudra Ancol. The methods of this research were literature review, interview and field observation. Data were analyzed using the suitability of management and animal welfare assessment. The result showed that there were three main management activities conducted at the three study locations, i. e., nutrition, housing, and health management. Bandung Zoo achieved the lowest score of <b>asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otter</b> welfare (45, 24 %) compared to Ragunan Zoo (62, 24 %) and Ocean Dream Samudra (65, 90 %). <b>Asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otter</b> welfare in three institutions were relatively low to fair category, {{this was due to}} the unfilled quality of food and water i. e.,  the type, amount, feeding frequency, diet and preparing of food; the unavailability of suitable and favorable environmental conditions; the care facilities provided could not ensure the health of animal; the appearance of abnormal behavior that affected the growth {{and breeding}} of animal; and animal had no freedom to behave as in their natural habitat.   Keywords: animal display, animal welfare, <b>Asian</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otter,</b> zoo  </p...|$|E
