500|$|Born in the United States {{and raised}} in Switzerland by French parents, Bozon {{possesses}} American and French citizenship. However he chose to play internationally for the French national team, as both {{his father and grandfather}} did. As Bozon said regarding his choice, [...] "All of my family are French, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> and father played for France’s national team. It’s why I play too." [...] At the 2011 IIHF World U18 Division I Championship, he helped France to a third-place finish, the first time the French under-18 team had ever won a medal in an IIHF tournament. His six points in five games were tied for eleventh overall in tournament scoring and tied for the lead on the French team. Bozon declined to participate in the 2012 World Junior Division IB Championships because he wanted to stay in North America and help the Blazers.|$|E

2500|$|Shaffir {{advocated}} for Israel {{to adopt a}} formal asylum [...] policy that distinguishes between refugees and migrants with quotas based on Israel’s capacity for absorption. She supported the Supreme Court’s quashing of the , which mandated an almost automatic three-year detention of ‘infiltrators.’ After all, she says, [...] "We are a country based on refugees. My grandmother escaped from Iraq <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> escaped during the Holocaust. It {{is a country that}} knows what it means to escape with your life." ...|$|E

5000|$|Dr. Remen's most {{well-known}} books include Kitchen Table Wisdom <b>and</b> <b>My</b> <b>Grandfather's</b> Blessing, {{both of which}} made The New York Times Best Seller list. Kitchen Table Wisdom has been translated into 21 languages, and has sold over 700,000 copies worldwide. She is also the founder of a medical student curriculum called [...] "The Healer's Art" [...] used in medical schools throughout the United States.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{was born}} here, {{and my father}} was born here before me, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather,</b> and my great-grandfathers. Were they not, Valentin?" [...] and she appealed to her brother.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think my}} father and mother saw it in the same light, and the breach between them <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> daily widened. But I have not told you the worst, yet. A party of cavalry rode up the other day, and were about, as usual, to seize upon some cattle. My father was out, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> stepped forward and asked them 'how they could lay it to their consciences to plunder Protestants when, a mile or two away, there were Catholics lording it over the soil--Catholics whose husbands and sons were {{fighting}} in the ranks of the army of James Stuart?' ...|$|E
60|$|However unwilling Master Philip {{had been}} to disturb himself for errands, he was nothing loth to show his knowledge, and recited glibly enough several lines of his Virgil verbatim; thereby {{pleasing}} his fond parents greatly <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> not a little.|$|E
6000|$|... "Break {{the promise}} which I made when I {{came upon the}} throne, <b>and</b> which <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> made before me. They wish me to recall the Edict of Nantes, and drive the Huguenots from the kingdom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dr. McGruer," [...] she said, [...] "go over at once <b>and</b> see <b>my</b> <b>grandfather.</b> He's {{completely}} exhausted {{with the}} work of selling Liberty Bonds. Be sure you order him to keep at home and remain quiet--at least for to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be careful, sir," [...] he said, fiercely. [...] "Those are not {{the words}} {{to be used to}} a Duke of Reist. By {{inheritance}} and by virtue of my name I, too, am the guardian of these people of Theos. I have lived with them all my life, as did <b>my</b> fathers <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfathers</b> before me. Their freedom and their happiness are a solemn charge to me. I {{have come to the conclusion}} that Ughtred of Tyrnaus is not able to maintain for them either." ...|$|R
60|$|From {{about the}} {{beginning}} of the century up to 1807 Robert Stevenson was in partnership with Thomas Smith. In the last-named year the partnership was dissolved; Thomas Smith returning to his business, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> becoming sole engineer to the Board of Northern Lights.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, let them! What do I care? Suppose, for argument's sake, {{that these}} Voices do come {{from my father}} <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather.</b> What do they know of this great city? They were country folks. How can they direct me in what I am to do?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{captain was}} made to tarry and sup with his Excellency <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather,</b> and I sat perforce a fourth at the table, scarce daring to {{conjecture}} as to the outcome of my escapade. But {{as luck would have}} it, the Governor had been that day in such worry and perplexity, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> also, that my absence had passed unnoticed. Nor did my good friend the captain utter a word to them of what he knew. But afterwards he called me to him and set me upon his knee. How big, and kind, and strong he was, and how I loved his bluff soldier's face and blunt ways. And when at last he spoke, his words burnt deep in my memory, so that even now I can repeat them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I would starve {{rather than}} do it!" [...] she exclaimed vehemently. [...] "And you can sing! I will go <b>and</b> live with <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> again!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] said Endymion. [...] "My {{father was}} in parliament, <b>and</b> so was <b>my</b> <b>grandfather,</b> but I confess I do not very well see my way there." ...|$|R
5000|$|My {{mother took}} me to hear The Messiah sung at the {{conservatory}} and I came away humming snatches of it. Mother thought I had a good musical ear <b>and</b> persuaded <b>my</b> <b>grandfather,</b> who was a religious man, to give me his violin...I was only six at the time, nevertheless, <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> pouted, [...] "I'll give him the violin. But if he ever plays at a dance I'll take it back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, that's {{a terrible}} picture, Mrs. Poyser. I think I {{should be doing}} you a service to turn you out of such a place. But there's no chance of that. I'm not likely to settle for the next twenty years, till I'm a stout gentleman of forty; <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> would never consent to part with such good tenants as you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This curious reticence on my part, {{is simply}} {{attributable}} to pure ignorance. Until affliction lay heavy on me, my father, my uncle, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> were hardly better known to me, in their true characters, {{than if they}} had been strangers passing in the street. How I contrived to become more intimately acquainted with my ancestors, I am now to reveal.|$|E
60|$|At this {{injustice}} I {{could not}} but cry out, {{for all the}} town knew, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> himself best of all, that the trouble from which he now suffered sprang from his gout. And yet my heart was smitten {{at the thought that}} I might have hastened or aggravated the attack. The Governor rose. He seized his stick aggressively and looked sharply at Grafton.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{father was}} king; {{his father was}} king. I have myself worn the crown for forty years, from my cradle. You have all sworn fealty to me as your sovereign, and your fathers did the same to <b>my</b> father <b>and</b> to <b>my</b> <b>grandfather.</b> How, then, can any one dispute my claim?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{was born}} at Longpuddle, and nursed at Longpuddle, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> father <b>and</b> <b>grandfather</b> before me,' said the {{passenger}} quietly.|$|R
50|$|His biography, {{written by}} his {{grandson}} Şefik Meetu Okday, {{was published in}} 1986 <b>and</b> is titled <b>My</b> <b>Grandfather,</b> the Last Grand Vizier, Ahmet Tevfik Pasha (Turkish: Büyükbabam Son Sadrazam Ahmet Tevfik Paşa).|$|R
60|$|Captain Jones {{has been}} at pains to mention in his letters the {{services}} rendered him by Mr. Carvel in fitting out the Ranger. <b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> gives a striking picture of the captain. At that time the privateers, with the larger inducements of profit they offered, were getting all the best seamen. John Paul had but to take two turns with a man across the dock, and he would sign papers.|$|E
60|$|Those {{days were}} not these, yet I make no show of hiding or of palliation. Was it Dorothy's conduct that drove me? Not wholly. A wild red was {{ever in the}} Carvel blood, in Captain Jack, in Lionel, in the {{ancestor}} of King Charles's day, who fought and bled and even gambled for his king. <b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> knew this; he warned me, but he paid my debts. And I thank Heaven he felt that my heart was right.|$|E
6000|$|... "My father, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather,</b> and my great-grand-father, managed, as {{you call}} it, to get along, for the last hundred years, well enough on the west side; and, {{although}} we are not quite as genteel as the east, we will do well enough. The Wallingford sails early in the morning, to save the tide; and I hope your lordship will turn out in season, and not keep us waiting. If you do, I shall be ungenteel enough to leave you behind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have told}} me that you sought what you held the best for me: open your heart to relenting <b>and</b> love toward <b>my</b> <b>grandfather,</b> who sought what he held the best for you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Greg: Yeah. <b>And</b> you know, <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> got tossed from Norway {{for getting}} my {{grandmother}} pregnant {{before they got}} married. To this day, he still tells me [...] "Som man reder, så ligger man.".|$|R
6000|$|... "To London," [...] Rupert said. [...] "This is {{no place}} for me now. I killed him in fair fight, and after warning; still, what with Sir William <b>and</b> <b>my</b> lady mother, there will be no {{stopping}} here. You had better ride back, Hugh, <b>and</b> tell <b>my</b> <b>grandfather,</b> privately, that I am going to the Earl of Marlborough, to ask him to give me the cornetcy he promised me." ...|$|R
60|$|Now at {{this story}} my {{grandfather}} was so enraged that he almost fell into a fit; then recovering, he bethought him of his cudgel of holly, and would have used it. But my father, who was now nineteen {{years of age and}} very stout and strong, twisted it from his hand and flung it full fifty yards, saying that no man should touch him more were he a hundred times his father. Then he walked away, leaving the prior <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> staring at each other.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hope not,' said Eugene; 'my father {{having been}} a shipper of lime before me, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> before him--in fact we {{having been a}} family {{immersed}} to the crowns of our heads in lime during several generations--I beg to observe that if this missing lime could be got hold of without any young female relative of any distinguished gentleman engaged in the lime trade (which I cherish next to my life) being present, I {{think it might be}} a more agreeable proceeding to the assisting bystanders, that is to say, lime-burners.' ...|$|E
60|$|And {{the second}} night he came back, and asked her again what she had seen her {{grandfather}} doing, and she answered him as before, and he broke in another door, and laughed and went away, and so each night till he reached the seventh door. Then the maiden {{wrote a letter to}} her brothers, and bound it round the neck of a pigeon, and said to it, 'Oh, thou pigeon that servedst my father <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather,</b> carry this letter to my brothers, and come back at once.' And the pigeon flew away.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My {{father did}} it, <b>and</b> so did <b>my</b> <b>grandfather,</b> <b>and</b> almost {{everybody}} in Nether-Moynton lives by it, and {{life would be}} so dull if it wasn't for that, that I should not care to live at all.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{no longer}} cared for little shut-in-places, for a coppice against the stable-yard at Merville where <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> lived {{or against the}} gable at Seaview where Aunt Micky lived, and I began to climb the mountains, {{sometimes}} with the stable-boy for companion, and to look up their stories in the county history. I fished for trout with a worm in the mountain streams and went out herring-fishing at night: <b>and</b> because <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> had said the English were in the right to eat skates, I carried a large skate all the six miles or so from Rosses Point, but <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> did not eat it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{heard of}} your brave deed {{on the night}} of the storm, Walter. Everyone is talking of it; <b>and</b> even <b>my</b> <b>grandfather,</b> who has seldom a good word for any of you at the Castle, said that it was a noble deed. It was as much as I could do not to say, 'Yes, he is a friend of mine;' for I felt proud of you, I can tell you." ...|$|R
