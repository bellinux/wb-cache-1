Manager Paul Jewell revealed {{that he was the}} type of player the club was searching for. After signing, Chopra said that he was hungry for goals. He started his Ipswich years with <b>a</b> <b>bang</b> scoring twice in his debut against Bristol City. He also scored a goal in each of the two match =es against his former club Cardiff City. He ended the season as the club's top scorer with 14 goals. However, Chopra had a lackluster second season with the club, where he scored five times in thirty six matches. Unhappy with his performance, manager Mick McCarthy said that he was not in his plans for going forward and they were free to look for another club. Nevertheless, he found the winner goal in the dying minutes of a match against Watford. Though he missed a couple of chance earlier in the match, he was successful in converting Carlos Edwards low cross in the last minute of the encounter.|$|E

25|$|Primitive hunting {{weapons are}} the only weapons {{permitted}} for some types of modern-day hunting. For example, the newly opened 2007 Florida Alligator Hunt specifically prohibits firearms due {{to the dangers of}} firing bullets around bodies of water, and recommends instead the use of a detachable-head harpoon for hunting alligators during the nighttime hours that hunting is permitted. <b>A</b> <b>bang</b> stick, a specialized type of firearm, is then often used to sever the spinal cord of the alligator just {{to the rear of the}} head. This kills the alligator immediately upon its being taken, as required by regulatory laws governing the hunt.|$|E
