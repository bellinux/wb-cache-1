40|$|The {{rapid growth}} in the {{maritime}} sector has raised concern about its environmental impact. It is essential and important to improve the environmental performance of maritime transportation without increasing cost. An <b>emission</b> <b>allocation</b> scheme {{is a prerequisite for}} the correct measurement of emissions, serving as a basis for the improvement. It can be described as the distribution of the emissions from transport activities to different elements of the transport chain (e. g., legs, vehicles) at different cargo aggregation levels. However, most of the main global emissions auditing standards or standard-like reports do not have a detailed discussion on <b>emission</b> <b>allocation.</b> In the field of maritime transportation, {{the focus is on the}} ferries and RoPax vessels, which represent a small part of global transport. The <b>emission</b> <b>allocation</b> regarding a return route, repositioning, or container shipping is still unresolved. It shows that <b>emission</b> <b>allocation</b> is a young and challenging discipline, especially at the cargo shipment level. Thus, in this thesis, we focus on <b>emission</b> <b>allocation</b> and its impact in maritime transportation. The work from this thesis shows that although the <b>emission</b> <b>allocation</b> is still in its infancy, it has a significant impact on environmental performance measurement. <b>Emission</b> <b>allocation</b> can provide information on the responsibility of different players with respect to emission reduction. It also provides insights for policy makers to device rules for calculating emission inventories, which can encourage collaboration and shared transport in complex, multi-stakeholder networks. Furthermore, by allocating the emissions to a specific cargo transport unit, the same basis for each transport mode can be achieved. This makes the measurement, comparison and benchmarking of the environmental performance in multimodal transport possible. Underlying principles an allocation scheme needs to fulfil are useful to support a selection of a proper <b>emission</b> <b>allocation</b> scheme in maritime transportation. Moreover, we suggest that the alternative allocation schemes adhering to the principles should be developed in different cases in maritime transportation according to the characteristics of network structure and cargoes. In this thesis, the cases based on a repositioning network and intermodal transport network are used to demonstrate how and why different schemes need to be considered. A simulation-based design of experiment method is applied to capture the behaviour of complex transport networks in these examples and also to analyze and optimize the results for furtherer performance improvement. The main contributions of this thesis can be summarized as: - A set of general principles an <b>emission</b> <b>allocation</b> scheme needs to fulfil in maritime transportation A set of <b>emission</b> <b>allocation</b> schemes which can be applied for different cases in maritime transportation including container shipping and repositioning transport network -The identification of, and insights into, the impact of <b>emission</b> <b>allocation</b> schemes on the environmental performance measurement - The application of a simulation-based design of experiment (DOE) method combined with optimization to improve the performance of maritime transportation efficientl...|$|R

40|$|Summary: The Australian {{government}} has recently approved Adani’s Carmichael coal project. If built, {{it would be}} the biggest coal mine in Australia. This briefing note puts the vast scale of Carmichael into context. The mine pits themselves would be 40 km long and 10 km wide, bigger than many capital cities. At peak capacity the mine would output 60 million tonnes of thermal coal per year. Adani expects Carmichael will output 2. 3 billion tonnes of coal over its lifetime: enough to build a road one-metre thick, ten-metres wide, wrapped around the world five times. Adani anticipates the mine – its operation and its coal [...] to produce 4. 7 billion tonnes of CO 2 -equivalent over its lifetime. This is more than 0. 5 % of the world carbon budget for limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Carmichael’s average <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> of 79 million tonnes of carbon equivalent, or CO 2 -e, are comparable to <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> from many countries, including: • Sri Lanka (57 MT CO 2 -e); • Malaysia (75 MT CO 2 -e); • Austria (76 MT CO 2 -e); • Vietnam (104 MT CO 2 -e); The carbon emissions of Carmichael’s coal mine operation and production will surpass or match the <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> of many major cities, including: • Three times the average <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> of New Delhi; • Six times the average <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> of Amsterdam; • Double the average <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> of Tokyo; • 20 per cent more than the average <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> of New York City; • Nearly half the average <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> of Beijing, a city with a population rivalling Australia. In addition, if the Carmichael project proceeds, its output of carbon-equivalent will neutralise many of the gains made through the effort of the international community to prevent dangerous global warming. Specifically, the increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the operating of Carmichael and the burning of its coal product will: • Entirely offset Australia’s carbon reduction goals; • Offset four-fifths of Canada’s carbon reduction goals; and • Offset half of Japan’s carbon reduction goals. As the international community prepares for the Paris talks, the world’s climate change abatement efforts rely on leaving the bulk of coal resources in the ground. To do otherwise risks locking in long-term emissions.  ...|$|R

40|$|The Three Gorges Project was {{implemented}} in 1994 to promote sustainable water resource use {{and development of}} the water environment in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (hereafter “Reservoir Area”). However, massive discharge of wastewater along the river threatens these goals; therefore, this study employs a grey prediction model (GM) to predict the <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> of primary pollution sources, including industrial wastewater, domestic wastewater, and oily and domestic wastewater from ships, that influence the Three Gorges Reservoir Area water environment. First, we optimize the initial values of a traditional GM (1, 1) model, and build a new GM (1, 1) model that minimizes the sum of squares of the relative simulation errors. Second, we use the new GM (1, 1) model to simulate historical <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> data for the four pollution sources and thereby test the effectiveness of the model. Third, we predict the <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> of the four pollution sources in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area for a future period. The prediction results reveal the <b>annual</b> <b>emission</b> trends for the major wastewater types, and indicate the primary sources of water pollution in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area.

40|$|We suggest {{and analyze}} {{a model of}} global {{technological}} growth under a prescribed constraint on the <b>annual</b> <b>emission</b> of greenhouse gases (GHG). The model assumes that industrial GHG emission is positively related to the world's production output driven {{by the development of}} the "production"technology stock. "Cleaning" technology is developed in parallel to keep the <b>annual</b> GHG <b>emission</b> within a "safety" zone. The ratio between annual investment in "cleaning" technology and annual investment in "production" technology acts as a time-variable control parameter in the model. Under a set of natural assumptions we 	find an optimal control which maximizes an integral utility characterizing the rate of economic growth over a given time period. In substantial terms, the optimal control strategy suggests that "production" technology is developed at a maximum rate until a critical point is reached at which the <b>annual</b> <b>emission</b> hits the prescribed upper bound. In the subsequent period investment in "production" and "cleaning" technology is planned so that the <b>annual</b> <b>emission</b> "tracks" the prescribed upper bound. One should note that the proposed control strategy optimal with respect to the chosen utility, is the most risky one since it assumes a minimum distance to the boundary of the "safety" zone...|$|R

Data from an extensive field measurement program were used to estimate <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> of tritiated water. Fugitive dust models were used to calculate estimates of the <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> of windblown dust. These estimates were combined with data on contamination levels in surface soils to develop <b>annual</b> <b>emission</b> rates for specific radionuclides: tritium, uranium- 238, cesium- 137, plutonium- 238, plutonium- 239, 240, and strontium- 90.

40|$|Emissions from {{residential}} combustion appliances vary significantly {{depending on}} the firing behaviours and combustion conditions, in addition to combustion technologies and fuel quality. Although wood pellet combustion in residential heating boilers is efficient, the combustion conditions during start-up and stop phases are not optimal and produce significantly high emissions such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon from incomplete combustion. The emissions from the start-up and stop phases of the pellet boilers are not fully {{taken into account in}} test methods for ecolabels which primarily focus on emissions during operation on full load and part load.  The objective of the thesis is to investigate the emission characteristics during realistic operation of residential wood pellet boilers in order to identify when the major part of the <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> occur. Emissions from four residential wood pellet boilers were measured and characterized for three operating phases (start-up, steady and stop). Emissions from realistic operation of combined solar and wood pellet heating systems was continuously measured to investigate the influence of start-up and stop phases on total <b>annual</b> <b>emissions.</b> Measured emission data from the pellet devices were used to build an emission model to predict the <b>annual</b> <b>emission</b> factors from the dynamic operation of the heating system using the simulation software TRNSYS.  Start-up emissions are found to vary with ignition type, supply of air and fuel, and time to complete the phase. Stop emissions are influenced by fan operation characteristics and the cleaning routine. Start-up and stop phases under realistic operation conditions contribute 80 – 95 % of annual carbon monoxide (CO) emission, 60 – 90 % total hydrocarbon (TOC), 10 – 20 % of nitrogen oxides (NO), and 30 – 40 % particles <b>emissions.</b> <b>Annual</b> <b>emission</b> factors from realistic operation of tested residential heating system with a top fed wood pelt boiler can be between 190 and 400 mg/MJ for the CO emissions, between 60 and 95 mg/MJ for the NO, between 6 and 25 mg/MJ for the TOC, between 30 and 116 mg/MJ for the particulate matter and between 2 x 1013 and 4 x 1013 /MJ for the number of particles. If the boiler has the cleaning sequence with compressed air such as in boiler B 2, <b>annual</b> CO <b>emission</b> factor can be up to 550 mg/MJ. Average CO, TOC and particles <b>emissions</b> under realistic <b>annual</b> condition were greater than the limits values of two eco labels. These results highlight the importance of start-up and stop phases in <b>annual</b> <b>emission</b> factors (especially CO and TOC). Since a large or dominating part of the <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> in real operation arise from the start-up and stop sequences, test methods required by the ecolabels should take these emissions into account. In this way it will encourage the boiler manufacturers to minimize <b>annual</b> <b>emissions.</b>  The <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> of residential pellet heating system can be reduced by optimizing the number of start-ups of the pellet boiler. It is possible to reduce up to 85 % of the number of start-ups by optimizing the system design and its controller such as switching of the boiler pump after it stops, using two temperature sensors for boiler ON/OFF control, optimizing of the positions of the connections to the storage tank, increasing the mixing valve temperature in the boiler circuit and decreasing the pump flow rate. For 85 % reduction of start-ups, 75 % of CO and TOC emission factors were reduced while 13 % increase in NO and 15 % increase in particle emissions was observed...|$|R

The voting mechanism is used for selecting equity principles for each power plant (market participant). The hierarchical system is composed of two subsystems. The upper level subsystem computes the emission allowances among all regions, while the lower level subsystem obtains the emission allowances among the power plants in each region. A test power system serves to illustrate the essential features of the proposed methodology, and the results are used to investigate the choice of equity principles of different types of power plants located in different regions.
