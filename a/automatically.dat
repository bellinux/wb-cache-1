5|$|Astronomical data {{taken with}} CCDs must undergo several {{calibration}} steps {{before they are}} suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that <b>automatically</b> calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated <b>automatically</b> is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected <b>automatically</b> need to be used.|$|E
5|$|Between every down, {{the player}} selects a formation, play and, on defense, {{coverage}} shell from a menu.

After a pass, control <b>automatically</b> changes to the ball receiver. On defense, the player may at any time switch control between any members of the team. Instant replay is available to review plays.|$|E

5|$|In {{commemoration}} of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom, a novelty pancake machine {{was built by}} The Happy Egg Company in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to <b>automatically</b> produce pancakes from scratch. The machine {{involves the use of}} a freshly laid egg from a hen that rolls onto a turntable, which then moves the egg to an area where it is <b>automatically</b> cracked and mixed with other ingredients. After this point, the mixture is poured into a griddle, flipped to cook the other side, and then flipped onto a plate.|$|E
5|$|MAR {{operated}} in two modes, surveillance, and engagement. In surveillance mode, the range was maximized, and each face performed a scan in about 5seconds. Returns were fed into systems that <b>automatically</b> extracted {{the range and}} velocity, and if the return was deemed interesting, the system <b>automatically</b> began a track for threat verification. During the threat verification phase, the radar spent more time examining the returns {{in an effort to}} accurately determine the trajectory and then ignored any objects that would fall outside its area.|$|E

The FMCSA is considering making EOBRs mandatory for all motor carriers.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} the first {{to be able to be}} resupplied by the newly {{developed}} unmanned Progress freighters, although they could only dock at the rear port, as the front port lacked the plumbing used to refuel the propulsion system. The freighters docked <b>automatically</b> to the station via the Igla, and were then opened and emptied by the cosmonauts on board, whilst transfer of fuel to the station took place <b>automatically</b> under supervision from the ground.|$|E
5|$|The train {{doors were}} {{originally}} designed to be opened and closed <b>automatically</b> and the doors would re-open if an object blocked them, much as elevator doors do. Almost immediately after the system opened in 1976 Metro realized these features were not conducive to safe or efficient operation and they were disabled. At present the doors may be opened <b>automatically</b> or manually. If a door tries to close and it meets an obstruction, the operator must re-open the door.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{decentralized}} Internet-based competition {{called the}} Online Contest, in which pilots upload their GPS data files and are <b>automatically</b> scored based on distance flown. Worldwide, 6,703pilots registered for this contest in 2010.|$|E
