5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} release of his Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell in 1845, Thomas Carlyle was asked to view the head. He did not, and {{on the basis of a}} friend's visit, wrote a scathing {{dismissal}} of the authenticity of the head: “it has hair, flesh and beard, a written history bearing that it was procured for £100 (I think of bad debt) about 50 years ago...the whole affair appears to be fraudulent moonshine, an element not pleasant even to glance into, especially in <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> Oliver's.” Fitzgibbons 2008, Pearson and Morant agree that Carlyle's dismissal was not based on any historical or scientific fact. Although Carlyle conceded that it was “the head of some decapitated man of distinction”, the only other known man of distinction to be embalmed and then decapitated in such a manner over the previous 200 years was Henry Ireton. George Rolleston had conducted an examination on another skull—called the Ashmolean skull—after claims that it was Cromwell's head. Rolleston was unconvinced by the skull's supposed history, and visited Wilkinson's home to see the skull shortly afterwards. After an examination, he dismissed the Ashmolean skull as a fake and declared that the Wilkinson head was the real head of Cromwell.|$|E

25|$|It {{may occur}} that systems of {{coordinates}} for two {{different sets of}} geometric figures are equivalent {{in terms of their}} analysis. An example of this is the systems of homogeneous coordinates for points and lines in the projective plane. The two systems in <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> this are said to be dualistic. Dualistic systems have the property that results from one system can be carried over to the other since these results are only different interpretations of the same analytical result; this is known as the principle of duality.|$|E
25|$|Polymorphism {{can extend}} beyond pure {{symmetry}} content. The aluminosilicates are {{a group of}} three minerals – kyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite – which share the chemical formula Al2SiO5. Kyanite is triclinic, while andalusite and sillimanite are both orthorhombic and belong to the dipyramidal point group. These difference arise correspond to how aluminium is coordinated within the crystal structure. In all minerals, one aluminium ion is always in six-fold coordination by oxygen; the silicon, as a general rule is in four-fold coordination in all minerals; an exception is <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> stishovite (SiO2, an ultra-high pressure quartz polymorph with rutile structure). In kyanite, the second aluminium is in six-fold coordination; its chemical formula can be expressed as AlAlSiO5, to reflect its crystal structure. Andalusite has the second aluminium in five-fold coordination (AlAlSiO5) and sillimanite has it in four-fold coordination (AlAlSiO5).|$|E
25|$|VAM Gremlins {{used the}} updated body {{design of the}} U.S. and Canadian market AMC Spirit two-door sedan, as well as VAM {{versions}} of the Spirit Liftback, called the American GT and the Rally AMX. At the time, cars in Mexico took longer {{to be perceived as}} outdated than in the US and since the VAM Gremlin came to the public until 1974 instead of 1970, it was still relatively fresh among the Mexican buyers. Aside from this, the model kept a positive image throughout its whole run. In fact, it exceeded VAM's sales expectations in its first years. The company originally considered it a temporary low-volume model that would eventually be replaced by the upcoming Pacer model. In the end, the Gremlin stood and became VAM's all-time second best-selling line after the American. For these reasons VAM decided to keep the Gremlin name for the upcoming Spirit sedan model, being a testament of the very favorable image VAM cars in general held in Mexico. This was the third time <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> this happened within the company with Rebel and Matador models kept the name Rambler Classic and the Hornet the Rambler American name.|$|E

2500|$|A {{legal team}} led by Julian Miles QC, media lawyer Steven Price, and {{barrister}} Felix Geiringer gathered round Nicky Hager, who is seeking a judicial review of the police action. Steven Price said [...] "Our case will be that the police didn't properly consider Nicky Hager's right to protect his confidential sources". Commenting on the case, law professor Ursula Cheer said: [...] "We've never really had <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> this before and we've never really had any of these (public interest) issues tested." ...|$|E

[...] "Waters provides little direct guidance as to {{the division of labor}} between judge and jury in <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> this one," [...] he observed. [...] "The critical question that, to this point, remains unanswered requires an assessment of the defendants' subjective motivation, a classic jury issue." ...|$|E

2500|$|Justice Thomas dissented. Justice Thomas {{criticized the}} court's {{determination}} of jurisdiction, arguing that [...] "he {{far more likely}} explanation for the [...] denial of habeas relied is that Foster's claim is procedurally barred ... a question of state law that [...] is powerless to review." [...] Justice Thomas notes that historically the Supreme Court would vacate and remand for clarification before proceeding to the merits of <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> this and [...] "refuse to presume that the unexplained denial of relief by the Supreme Court of Georgia presents a federal question." [...] Justice Thomas then proceeded to reject the court's analysis of the Batson claim.|$|E
2500|$|... "In {{the final}} analysis," [...] he wrote, [...] "a Justice's vote in <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> this depends more {{on his or}} her views about the {{respective}} lawmaking responsibilities of Congress and this Court than on conflicting policy interests. Judges who have confidence in their own ability to fashion public policy are less hesitant to change the law than {{those of us who are}} inclined to give wide latitude to the views of the voters' representatives on nonconstitutional matters." [...] While he had admittedly helped start the discussions about the various interpretations of Wilko in his dissent in Scherk v. Alberto-Culver, Inc. while chief judge of the Seventh Circuit, he said [...] "one of these arguments, however, carries sufficient weight to tip the balance between judicial and legislative authority and overturn an interpretation of an Act of Congress that has been settled for many years." ...|$|E
2500|$|The church {{released}} a statement through spokesman Dale Jones on 28 January 2016 mourning the reported suicides of 32 LGBT Mormons. The release stated that leaders and members are taught to [...] "reach out in an active, caring way to all, especially to youth who feel estranged or isolated". On 9 February 2016 when apostle Dallin H. Oaks was asked about church leaders and members' responsibility {{for the treatment of}} LGBT individuals that may have precipitated in suicides he stated [...] "that's a question that will be answered on judgment day" [...] and that [...] "nobody is sadder about <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> that than I am". In June 2016 the church published its official Mental Health website followed shortly in September 2016 by its official Preventing Suicide website. In August 2017, the LDS Church supported the LoveLoud Festival, a concert event at Utah Valley University raising money for charities which support LGBTQ youth.|$|E

2500|$|In {{choosing}} the surface Σ(t), the restrictions are that (i) {{it has to}} be bounded by a closed curve around which the EMF is to be found, and (ii) it has to capture the relative motion of all moving parts of the circuit. It is emphatically not required that the bounding curve corresponds to a physical line of flow of the current. On the other hand, induction is all about relative motion, and the path emphatically must capture any relative motion. In <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> Figure 1 where a portion of the current path is distributed over a region in space, the EMF driving the current can be found using a variety of paths. Figure 2 shows two possibilities. All paths include the obvious return loop, but in the disc two paths are shown: one is a geometrically simple path, the other a tortuous one. We are free to choose whatever path we like, but a portion of any acceptable path is fixed in the disc itself and turns with the disc. The flux is calculated though the entire path, return loop plus disc segment, [...] and its rate-of change found.|$|E

From it, the casuist would ask how closely the given case currently under consideration matches the paradigmatic <b>case.</b> <b>Cases</b> <b>like</b> the paradigmatic <b>case</b> ought to be treated likewise; cases unlike the paradigm ought to be treated differently. Thus, a man is properly charged with premeditated murder if the circumstances surrounding his case closely resemble the exemplary premeditated murder <b>case.</b> The less <b>a</b> given <b>case</b> is <b>like</b> the paradigm, the weaker the justification is for treating that <b>case</b> <b>like</b> the paradigmatic <b>case.</b>|$|R
