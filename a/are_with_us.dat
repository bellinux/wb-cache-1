"One Tree Hill" [...] {{was absent}} during the {{majority}} of the Zoo TV Tour, only appearing as an extended snippet at the end of [...] "One" [...] at both concerts in New Zealand in 1993. It did not appear again until 24November 2006 in Auckland, New Zealand, on the final leg of the Vertigo Tour. It was considered to close the concert, but tour designer Willie Williams voiced concern as it had not been performed in full since 1990. The song was performed before [...] "Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own" [...] in the main set instead. U2 performed it an additional three times on the tour. [...] "One Tree Hill" [...] was absent for {{the majority of}} the U2 360° Tour but was revived in November 2010 for two concerts in New Zealand, where it was dedicated to the miners who died in the Pike River Mine disaster; their names were displayed on the video screen during the song. Dedicating the song, Bono said, [...] "we wrote it for Greg Carroll, whose family <b>are</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> tonight. But tonight it belongs to the miners of the West Coast Pike River." [...] U2 played [...] "One Tree Hill" [...] on 25March 2011, in Santiago, Chile, in a duet with Francisca Valenzuela, and they dedicated it to Victor Jara.|$|E

2500|$|Reading [...] the 20th century Israeli scholar Nechama Leibowitz {{wrote that}} people in their {{blindness}} tend to detect the guiding hand of Providence only when manifested in visible miracles, as the Israelites witnessed in the wilderness. People fail to see the hidden miracles performed for them continually when {{the world around them}} seems to be going on as usual. For this reason, the formulators of the liturgy obliged Jews to give thanks three times daily (in the final benedictions of the Amidah prayer) [...] "for Your miracles that <b>are</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> every day and for Your wonders and Your bounties that are at all times, evening, morning, and noon." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not all Bumiputra {{political}} leaders shared Badawi's views. For example, Badruddin Amiruldin, {{who was elected}} as UMNO's Deputy Permanent chairman, waved {{a book about the}} 13 May incident at the assembly during his speech while declaring, [...] "No other race has the right to question our privileges, our religion and our leader", continuing that any such action would be akin to [...] "stirring up a hornet's nest". The following day, Dr. Pirdaus Ismail, a UMNO Youth Executive Committee member, stated, [...] "Badruddin did not pose the question to all Chinese in the country. Those who <b>are</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> who hold the same understanding as we do, were not our target. In defending Malay rights, we direct our voice at those who question them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{mainstream}} of Roman philosophy, {{such as the}} Stoics, advocated contemplation and acceptance of the inevitability of death of all mortals. [...] "It is necessary for some to stay and for others to go, all the while rejoicing with those who <b>are</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> yet not grieving for those departing." [...] To grieve bitterly is to fail to perceive and accept the nature of things. Famously, Epictetus encouraged contemplation of one's loved ones as a [...] "jar" [...] or [...] "crystal cup" [...] which might break and be remembered without troubling the spirit, since [...] "you love a mortal, something not your own. It {{has been given to}} you for the present, not inseparably nor forever, but like a fig... at a fixed season of the year. If you yearn for it in the winter, you are a fool." ...|$|E

2500|$|During a BBC {{interview}} in 2001, Harīrī {{was asked by}} Tim Sebastian why he refused to hand over members of Hezbollah that were accused by America of being terrorists. He responded that Hezbollah were the ones protecting Lebanon against the Israeli occupation and called for implementation of passed United Nations resolutions against Israel. He was further accused of making the American coalition {{in the war on}} terrorism worthless and asked if he was ready for the consequences of his refusal, reminding him that George W. Bush had said: [...] "Either you <b>are</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> or you are with the terrorists." [...] He replied that he had hoped there would be no consequences, but would deal with them if they arrive. Hariri further said that he opposed the killing of all humans – Israeli, Palestinian, Syrian or Lebanese – and believed in dialogue as a solution. He further went on to say that Syria would have to stay in Lebanon for protection of Lebanon until they are no longer needed and Lebanon asks them to leave.|$|E
