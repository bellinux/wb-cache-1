40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to answer the}} following research questions: (1) How do midshipmen learn about leadership? (2) How do officer learning processes differ from midshipmen learning processes? The learning literature and the leadership literature identified the following leadership learning processes: (1) experience, (2) observation, (3) reflection, (4) experimentation, (5) interpersonal interactions, (6) organizational cultural, (7) formal instruction (i. e., conceptualization), and (8) self-direction. To test the research questions, the author conducted 25 focused interviews with Naval Academy midshipmen, Naval Postgraduate School students, and Naval Academy leadership instructors. The interview data was transcribed and analyzed. The data analysis yielded eight general themes related to midshipmen leadership development. The data suggested midshipmen learn leadership from the following sources: experience, observation, reflection, interpersonal interaction, and organizational culture. The interview data further suggested midshipmen do not learn leadership from formal classroom instruction; however, the officer interview data supported conceptualization (i. e., theoretical instruction) as an important leadership learning process. The officer interview data suggested that graduate students and leadership instructors use an integrated (i. e., systems) <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> leadership. NAU. <b>S.</b> Navy (U. S.

Despite mixed empirical evidence, the possibility of encouraging students to adopt a deep <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> through interventions in the learning context is suggested by the <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> and metacognition literatures. Functional Linguistics (Halliday, 1985) provides principles upon which such interventions might be based. This paper, first, provides a rich description of an intervention in an introductory accounting course to encourage a deep <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> by improving students' written communication skills. Second, the effectiveness of the intervention is examined by comparing students' <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> using Biggs' (1987 a) Study Process Questionnaire, with those at another leading Australian university offering a more 'traditional' course.

40|$|AbstractThe “approaches to learning” {{framework}} {{is widely used}} in higher education. Unlike other learning styles models, a person's <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> {{is seen as a}} function of the interaction between the learner, the discipline and the context (rather than as a function of personality traits).

Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of three different inventories (<b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> metacognition and personality), we identify that these constructs do not appear to be distinct from each other, and consequently that the <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> model may misrepresent both the nature and the importance of strategic <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning...</b>|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} <b>to</b> measure the <b>learning</b> <b>approach</b> (deep versus surface) of first-year engineering students, test the impact of two interventions (journaling and learning strategy awareness) on increasing the deep <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> and determine the relationship of the <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> on retention within {{an engineering}} program. 	The study was conducted using a quantitative self-reporting instrument to measure surface and deep learning at the beginning and end of the first and second semesters of the freshman year in an engineering program. Retention was measured as the continuous enrollment of a student in the second semester of the first-year engineering program. 	Results indicate that the first-year engineering students have a slightly higher level of the deep <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> than a surface <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> when they begin college. However, the results also indicate that the deep <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> decreased during the first semester and during the second semester of their freshman year. A student's <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> can be impacted by their prior knowledge, the teaching context, the institutional context or the motivation of the student. Results surrounding the learning strategies intervention also indicate that the first-year engineering students do not possess the strong learning strategies that are anticipated from students accepted into an engineering program with stringent application requirements. Finally, results indicate that a deep <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> appears <b>to</b> have a positive relationship and a surface <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> appears <b>to</b> have a negative relationship to retention in an engineering program. This study illustrates that incorporating learning theory and the use of current learning strategy measurements contributes to the understanding of a freshman engineering student's <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> The understanding of the engineering student's <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> benefits faculty in establishing curriculum and pedagogical design.

For this paper, only the outcome measure of self-directed learning is presented. The study was guided by Kek’s (2006) two-level integrated theoretical framework, designed to examine ‘student and teacher ecological systems’ and their influences on student learning and outcomes in higher education. Data from a large cross-sectional survey and structured in-depth interviews, for both students and teachers was analysed. Single-level quantitative analyses using partial least square path (PLSPATH) and multi-level analyses using the hierarchical linear modelling technique (HLM) were used. The survey data was drawn from a total of 44 PBL classrooms, 392 students and 32 teachers. Interviews were conducted with three teachers and 18 students. The PLSPATH findings revealed that parental involvement continued to influence how students learn and influence outcomes at the university level. A surface <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> was found <b>to</b> be related to poor quality outcomes and a deep <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> was related <b>to</b> high quality outcomes. The HLM analyses revealed which and how teaching factors directly and indirectly influenced <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> and outcomes.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an empirical study aimed at analysing the role of self-regulation in different <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> that were established in the previous studies. We examined whether certain categories of metacognitive strategies were present in the deep, surface and achievement-oriented approach. The sample included 560 first- to fifth-year students of the Teacher Training Faculty, the Faculty of Philosophy and the Faculty of Philology of the University of Belgrade. A shorter version of the Instrument for measuring learning goals and strategies was applied. The previous research had established that learning goals and strategies comprised by this instrument were grouped into three second-order factors: the surface, deep and achievement-oriented <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> The items from the Scale of students’ metacognitive strategies were included. Factor analysis confirmed the existence of the three <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> that include learning goals and strategies. We analysed the frequency of individual <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> on the total sample, the frequency of individual approaches in the respondents of different gender and the correlations of the <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> with the age, year of studies and academic achievement. Different metacognitive strategies contribute to the defining of the deep and achievement-oriented <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> but they do not occur in the surface <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> According <b>to</b> the obtained findings, self-regulation can play different roles in accordance with the goals set by students and the strategies used in learning. The results of this study point to possible directions of encouraging the deep <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> and self-regulation at the university level, as well as in primary and secondary school.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{a wide range}} of {{teaching}} methods that emphasise the independence of the student have been implemented and investigated under the common denomination of student-centred learning environments. The main and consistent goal of all these learning environments is fostering a deeper level of learning and understanding. Despite promising results, the specific conceptual origin of this doctoral research lies in the finding that student-centred learning environments do not always push students towards a deep <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> These <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> include the intentions of the students and the strategies they use <b>to</b> <b>learn.</b> A student with a surface <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> seeks <b>to</b> reproduce the course material. The most popular strategies among these students are rote learning and unreflective memorisation. A deep <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> is associated with an intrinsic interest in the subject. The students intention is to understand the material by making use of various strategies such as conceptual analysis, reflection, discussing the material, looking up additional information, among others, to that effect. When carried out thoroughly, this deep <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> generally results in higher quality learning outcomes. The inconclusiveness of results in the research on student centred learning environments has given rise to the question as to what specific factors influence the induction of a deep <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> This doctoral dissertation comprises 6 articles: 1 literature review and 5 empirical studies based on two experiments. In addition, there is a general introduction and a conclusion which focuses on what we have learned from this research and its limitations. Finally, some suggestions are put forward for future research. The first chapter is a literature review: based on the scientific literature, specific encouraging or discouraging factors, suggested by research on the influence of student centred learning environments, were identified. Next the nature of the influence of these factors on students <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> was investigated. This literature study revealed a lot of possible encouraging and discouraging factors that can be divided into three general categories: context, perceived context and individual characteristics. A selection of variables to study was carried out, based on the literature review, and the influence of five independent variables (perceived workload, perceived task complexity, motivation, working memory capacity and attention) on students <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> were investigated. Chapter 2 to chapter 5 report on the different hypotheses investigated regarding the relationships of these selected variables with <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> Chapter 2 investigated the influence of perceived workload and task complexityon students <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> This study identified lack of information, as an aspect of task complexity, as a generally inhibiting factor when trying to induce a deep <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> It also showed the differential influence of familiarity on <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> under different workload and task complexity conditions. Chapter 3 focused on the direct and indirect influence of motivation on learning approaches. It showed that autonomous motivation influences the perception of a lack of information. Moreover, autonomous motivation does not only influence students <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> in an indirect manner. It also has a direct positive influence on deep <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> Chapter 4 is an exploratory study which investigates if working memory capacity and attention relate <b>to</b> students <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> Results indicate that students with high cognitive capacities use less deep approaches but they also show lesser use of surface <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> In chapter 5 the methodology of the previous chapters was supplemented with a complementary person oriented approach, examining if different student profiles could be identified based on the motivation and working memory capacity of the student. It was further explored if these different profiles differed in their learning approaches and whether they experienced a different influence of workload in their learning approaches. This study concluded that students with a different profile differed in their <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> and were influenced by workload in the same way. Chapter 6 examined, by means of a neural network analysis, which variables were important for predicting the best, weakest and middle group of students in terms of academic performance, and how well they could predict learning outcomes. The predictors that were included were students <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> their motivation and their cognitive capacities: working memory capacity and attention. Results showed that the academic performance of the top and bottom 20 % were best predicted by only their cognitive capacities, while <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> and motivation only contributed to the prediction of the middle group in addition to their cognitive skills. nrpages: 300 status: publishe...|$|R

However, deep learning has drawn more attention {{in recent years as}} institutions attempt to tap their student’s full <b>learning</b> potential. <b>To</b> more fully develop student talents, many campuses are shifting from a traditional passive, instructor-dominated pedagogy to active, learner-centered activities. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis on multiple years of data from the National Survey of Student Engagement, this study examines the structure and characteristics of items about student uses of deep <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> Institutions and researchers can use the resulting scales to assess and investigate deep <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> Deep <b>Approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>Learning</b> 3 Measuring Deep <b>Approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>Learning</b> Using the National Survey of Student Engagement Colleges and universities are devoting substantial effort to design active, learner-centered teaching and learning environments.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a phenomenographic research study which sought <b>to</b> identify students' <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> introductory accounting and their conceptions of accounting. The findings reveal that, in common with other disciplines, deep and surface <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> can be identified. However, the main contribution of this study lies in two areas. First, it distinguishes those features that are characteristic of the deep and surface approaches within the discipline of accounting. Secondly, it identifies contextual features surrounding these <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> and which are central to an understanding of them. The paper suggests how these findings can be used immediately to make changes within teaching and assessment practice through a phenomenographic pedagogy which: seeks to make students' conceptions of the subject matter explicit; provides diagnostic tools for the identification of distinctively different conceptions of the subject and <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> learning; and addresses issues of preconceptions and relevance within teaching and assessment. The findings can also be used as the basis for further research into the identification of statistical variation in <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> between students.

40|$|The study set out {{to examine}} the psychometric {{properties}} of the scores obtained on the modified 20 -item Revised Two Factor Study Process Questionnaire (R-SPQ- 2 F). The study also investigated the relationship between scores on the R-SPQ- 2 F and students’ learning-related outcomes. In addition, it also examined for any relationships among student’s background variables of gender, choice of academic discipline, age, English language competency, <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> and learning-related outcomes. Data based on responses of 368 Malaysian students undertaking the twinning mode of study showed the modified R-SPQ- 2 F to be reliable and factorially valid. The findings also found deep <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> were positively related to students’ learning-related outcomes, while surface <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> were negatively associated. Students’ background characteristics such as choice of academic discipline and English language competency, and <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> were good predictors of students’ learning-related outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between students' motivation and attitudes towards mathematics, the <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> they use, and their achievement in mathematics {{has been widely}} documented in middle school and further academic levels. However, the empirical research in earlier educational stages remains scarce. This study analyzed the predictive value of affective-motivational variables and deep and surface <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> on mathematics achievement {{in a sample of}} 524 upper elementary students. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine the predictors of mathematics achievement. Mathematics enjoyment positively predicted mathematics achievement and age {{and the use of the}} surface <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> negatively predicted mathematics achievement. The variables in the model explained 21. 3 % of the variance in mathematics achievement. Mean differences in the affective-motivational variables and <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> occurred between students with very high and very low achievement in Mathematics, yielding further evidence of important differences between the achievement extremes...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we aim {{to explore}} and thematically analyze higher {{education}} teachers’ notions about the most important problems related <b>to</b> students’ <b>learning,</b> including the teachers’ notions of the <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> that the students adopt. The study {{was carried out in}} Rwanda with 25 university teachers engaged in group interviews. Inspired by the concepts of metaphors for <b>learning</b> and <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> five main categories of students’ learning problems were identified: dependence, physical and economic resources, experience of a deep <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> reading culture, and previous preparation for higher education. These problems are interrelated and point to the need to understand study levels in education systems as being interdependent. ...|$|R
