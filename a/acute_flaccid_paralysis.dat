5|$|This {{is a list}} of notable {{people who}} have survived the {{infectious}} disease poliomyelitis. Poliomyelitis (often simply called polio) is an acute viral infection that involves the gastrointestinal tract and occasionally the central nervous system. Poliovirus is acquired by faecal-oral or oral transmission. Prior to the introduction of a vaccine in 1955, infection was common, with epidemics during the summer and autumn of temperate countries. An eradication programme has reduced the number of reported polio cases worldwide by more than 99% since the mid-1980s. Most infections are asymptomatic; a small number cause a minor illness that is indistinguishable from many other viral illnesses; less than 1% result in <b>acute</b> <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis.</b> The extent of paralysis varies from part of a limb to quadriplegia and respiratory failure. The latter was often treated with an iron lung until, it was hoped, the patient recovered. Around 30–40 years after contracting paralytic poliomyelitis, about 25–40% of cases lead to post-polio syndrome. Symptoms include muscle pain, further weakening of muscles and paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Active {{surveillance}} {{for wild}} poliovirus through reporting and laboratory testing {{of all cases}} of <b>acute</b> <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis.</b> <b>Acute</b> <b>Flaccid</b> <b>Paralysis</b> (AFP) is a clinical manifestation of poliomyelitis characterized by weakness or paralysis and reduced muscle tone without other obvious cause (e.g., trauma).

40|$|Silent {{thyroiditis}} {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. The objective was to present a case of silent thyroiditis presenting as periodic paralysis. A 23 -year-old man presented with recurrent <b>acute</b> <b>flaccid</b> predominantly proximal weakness of all four limbs. He had a similar episode 3 weeks back. On examination he {{was found to have}} hypokalemia secondary to thyrotoxicosis. Clinically there were no features of thyrotoxicosis or thyroiditis. He was initially treated with intravenous and later oral potassium supplementation and propranolol. At 8 weeks of follow-up his thyroid profile became normal and his propranolol was stopped. He had no further recurrence of paralysis. He was diagnosed as a case silent thyroiditis presenting as thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. In cases of recurrent or <b>acute</b> <b>flaccid</b> muscle <b>paralysis,</b> it is important to suspect thyrotoxicosis, even if asymptomatic.

500|$|The virus {{enters the}} central nervous system in about 1 percent of infections. Most {{patients}} with CNS involvement develop nonparalytic aseptic meningitis, with symptoms of headache, neck, back, abdominal and extremity pain, fever, vomiting, lethargy, and irritability. About one to five in 1000 cases progress to paralytic disease, in which the muscles become weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and, finally, completely paralyzed; this condition is known as <b>acute</b> <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis.</b> [...] Depending on the site of paralysis, paralytic poliomyelitis is classified as spinal, bulbar, or bulbospinal. Encephalitis, an infection of the brain tissue itself, can occur in rare cases, and is usually restricted to infants. It is characterized by confusion, changes in mental status, headaches, fever, and, less commonly, seizures and spastic paralysis.|$|E

30|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} is a recognizable entity for the commonest cause of <b>acute</b> childhood <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis</b> {{in the field}} of pediatric neurology [9]. Several reports in larger numbers of GBS patients have been delineated from the neurologists’ point of view, but there are few reports which specifically describe orthopaedic aspects [17, 18]. Some of the pediatric GBS patients consult the orthopaedists first because limb pain and gait disturbance are frequent primary complaints. Indeed, five of the seven patients initially consulted the orthopaedic department in the present study. The orthopaedists, however, are unfamiliar with the disease, since it has rarely been reported in detail in the orthopaedic literature. To prevent diagnostic delay, orthopaedists {{should be aware of the}} early symptoms and clinical manifestations of pediatric GBS.|$|R
40|$|Tick {{paralysis}} is a {{rare disease}} characterized by <b>acute,</b> ascending, <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis</b> that is often confused with other acute neurologic disorders or diseases (e. g., Guillain-Barré syndrome or botulism).

During May 26 – 31, 2006, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment received reports of four recent cases of tick paralysis. The four patients lived (or had visited someone) within 20 miles of each other in the mountains of north central Colorado. This report summarizes the four cases and emphasizes the need to increase awareness of tick paralysis among health-care providers and persons in tick-infested areas. Case 1.

40|$|Objective Botulism is the <b>acute,</b> descending, <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis</b> {{that results}} when the neurotoxin of Clostridium botulinum blocks neuromuscular transmission. C botulinum toxin {{is the most}} {{poisonous}} substance that blocks neuromuscular transmission and causes death through airway and respiratory muscle paralysis; all forms of botulism manifest neurologically as asymmetric, descending, <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis</b> beginning with the cranial nerve musculature. Food-borne botulism results from the ingestion of food in which C botulinum has multiplied and produced its toxin. Patient We report a new case of food-borne botulism in a 7 year old boy with recurrent episodes of weakness, difficulty in swallowing and speech; bilateral ptosis and mydriasis. He had positive history of the same symptoms, documented twice before. The patient’s samples were sent for detection of toxin of Clostridium botulinum, and toxin of C. botulinum, type A was found in his stool sample, confirming our diagnosis. This case was unusual report because our patient has not history of canned food ingestion and also because recurrent episodes of paralysis in this case are unusual findings in botulism. ConclusionIn this report we {{want to emphasize that}} canned-food ingestion is not necessary for diagnosis of food-borne botulism and because delayed treatment leads to increase mortality and morbidity, treatment should be initiated promptly on the basis of clinical suspicio...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe West Nile virus (WNV) re-emerged in Tunisia in 2003, {{causing an}} {{outbreak}} of meningoencephalitis. Objective. - The authors studied the epidemiological, clinical, biological, and imaging features of WNV-associated neurological disease observed in central eastern Tunisia. Design. - A retrospective descriptive study was made on patients with West Nile meningitis and/or encephalitis observed in the Sousse area, from August 15 to November 15, 2003. Screening for specific anti-WNV antibodies in serum was performed with Elisa. Results. - Recent central nervous system infection due to WNV was confirmed in 21 patients {{with a mean age}} of 53 years and a sex ratio of 3. 2. The clinical presentation was meningitis in 11 cases, meningoencephalitis in seven cases, and encephalitis in three cases. Patients with encephalitis were older than those with meningitis. An <b>acute</b> <b>flaccid</b> limb <b>paralysis</b> was observed in three patients. The CSF assay showed lymphocytosis, high protein (67 %), and normal glucose levels (83 %). Brain CT scan and MRI were normal. Three patients died, the remaining evolved uneventfully. Conclusions. - These first cases of WNV meningoencephalitis in Sousse area suggest a possibility of reemergence of this infection. Preventives measures and epidemiological surveillance are necessary.

40|$|See the {{editorial}} commentary by Sobel on pages 1674 – 5) Background. California has an ongoing epidemic of wound botulism (WB) among {{injection drug users}} (IDUs). We retrospectively studied a cohort of patients with WB and determined {{the sensitivity of the}} mouse bioassay— the gold standard laboratory test for confirmation of botulism—in verifying WB. Methods. We defined a clinical case of WB as an <b>acute,</b> bilateral, descending, <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis</b> starting with 1 cranial nerve palsies in an IDU with no other explainable diagnosis. We calculated the sensitivity of the mouse bioassay as the proportion of clinical WB cases that had positive serum toxin test results by mouse bioassay. We compared serum toxin–positive with serum toxin–negative patients. Results. Of 73 patients with WB, 50 tested serum toxin positive, yielding a sensitivity of 68 %. Serum toxin– positive patients did not differ significantly from serum toxin–negative patients with respect to demographic characteristics or injection drug use practices or in days from patient symptom onset to collection of specimens for testing. Patients did not differ significantly by clinical characteristics, except that serum toxin–positive patients were more likely than serum toxin–negative patients to have required mechanical ventilation during their hospital courses (74 % vs. 43 %;).

40|$|Metagenomic {{sequence}} {{data can}} be used to detect the presence of infectious viruses and bacteria, but normal microbial flora make this process challenging.

We found that among the patients whose symptoms were previously attributed to enterovirus D 68, one patient had clear evidence of infection with Haemophilus influenzae, and a second patient had a severe Staphylococcus aureus infection caused by a methicillin-resistant strain. Neither of these bacteria were identified in the original study. These observations may have relevance in cases that present with <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis</b> because bacterial infections, co-infections or post-infection immune responses may trigger pathogenic processes that may present as poliomyelitis-like syndromes and may mimic AFM.   A separate finding was that large numbers of human sequences were present in each of the publicly released samples, although the original study reported that human sequences had been removed before deposition...|$|R

On April 10, 1995, a 2 -year-old girl who resided in Asotin County, Washington, was taken to the emergency department of a regional hospital because of a 2 -day history of unsteady gait, difficulty standing, and reluctance to walk. Other than a recent history of cough, she had been healthy and had not been injured. On physical examination, she was afebrile, alert, and active but could stand only briefly before requiring assistance. Cranial nerve function was intact. However, she exhibited marked extremity and mild truncal ataxia, and deep tendon reflexes were absent. She was admitted with a tentative diagnosis of either Guillain-Barré syndrome or postinfectious polyradiculopathy. Within several hours of hospitalization, she had onset of drooling and tachypnea. A nurse incidentally detected an engorged tick on the girl’s hairline by an ear and removed the tick. Within 7 hours after tick removal, tachypnea subsided and reflexes were present but diminished.

The T-zone is roughly a T-shaped area from the outside of one eye socket to the outside of other eye socket and extending down the bridge of the nose to the upper lip. This area forms the [...] "T" [...] from which it derives its name. When the bullet enters the T-zone, it strikes the medulla oblongata causing <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis.</b> The advantage of <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis</b> is the subject is rendered incapacitated instantaneously preventing involuntary muscle contraction that may pull the trigger or cause other movements that may injure or kill the hostage. This is a difficult shot even by the best marksman and should only be attempted by trained personnel.|$|R
