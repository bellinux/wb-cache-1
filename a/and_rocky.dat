5|$|After Miranda, Ariel is the second-smallest of Uranus' {{five major}} rounded {{satellites}} and the second-closest to its planet. Among {{the smallest of}} the Solar System's 19 known spherical moons (it ranks 14th among them in diameter), it is believed to be composed of roughly equal parts ice <b>and</b> <b>rocky</b> material. Its mass is approximately equal in magnitude to Earth's hydrosphere.|$|E
5|$|Desert {{conditions}} persist on canyon bottoms <b>and</b> <b>rocky</b> ledges {{away from}} perennial streams. Sagebrush, prickly pear cactus, and rabbitbrush, along with sacred datura and Indian paintbrush, are common. Utah penstemon and golden aster {{can also be}} found. Milkvetch and prince's plume are found in pockets of selenium-rich soils.|$|E

5|$|Individual sharks choose sites {{giving them}} the best ambush success. They prefer {{junctions}} of sandy <b>and</b> <b>rocky</b> substrates near reefs (used by many fishes for shelter) usually orienting themselves either toward or parallel to nearby vertical structures. They tend to face upslope, which may facilitate burying via falling sediment, bring more fish swimming downstream from the reef, or ease targeting by silhouetting prey against the sunlight.|$|E

It {{occupies}} talus piles (collection of broken rock pieces at the base of cliffs, volcanoes, or valley shoulders, accumulated due to periodic rockfall from adjacent cliff faces) with larger stones <b>and</b> <b>rocky</b> areas although it does not inhabit swampy montane tundra or talus lacking vegetation. It may also live in burrows under tree roots or in old moss-scree.|$|E

5|$|The {{geologic}} {{story of}} the Kootenay is strongly connected to the geology of the Columbia, Selkirk <b>and</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains.

5|$|Titan is {{primarily}} composed of water ice <b>and</b> <b>rocky</b> material. Much as with Venus before the Space Age, the dense opaque atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan's surface until new {{information from the}} Cassini–Huygens mission in 2004, including the discovery of liquid hydrocarbon lakes in Titan's polar regions. The geologically young surface is generally smooth, with few impact craters, although mountains and several possible cryovolcanoes have been found.|$|E

5|$|During {{its early}} days of settlement, the Lower Clarence {{district}} lacked roads; virtually all communication within the area and {{with the outside world}} depended upon water transport. Lower Clarence settlers were by necessity good oarsmen, and several of them became national and even world champion scullers. Rush, who in his prime was over six feet tall and weighed 13 stone, soon distinguished himself as a powerful 'puller'. He rowed the heavy settlers’ boats, also known as 'butcher boats' delivering meat to Clarence River customers. By 1866, Rush was competing in various regattas regularly held among the riverside settlements of Ulmarra, Lawrence, Brushgrove <b>and</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mouth.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, sea lions gather on both sandy <b>and</b> <b>rocky</b> shores. On warm days, they lie {{closer to the}} water. At night or in cool weather, they travel farther inland or to higher elevations. Non-breeding individuals may gather at marinas, wharves, or even navigational buoys. California sea lions can also live in fresh water for periods of time, such as near Bonneville Dam, nearly 150 miles up the Columbia River. In 2004 a healthy sea lion was found sitting on a road in Merced County, California, almost a hundred miles upstream from the San Francisco Bay and {{half a mile from}} the San Joaquin River.|$|E
