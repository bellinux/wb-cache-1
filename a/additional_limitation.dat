One <b>additional</b> <b>limitation</b> of reporting on a series of cases receiving clinical treatment (as opposed to participants enrolled in a formal research protocol) is that there tend to be variations in how the treatment is applied across participants. This is particularly the case with behavioral interventions which are individualized, and continuously evaluated, and altered based on the individual’s response. An ideal middle ground would involve the use of treatment algorithms to structure how treatment components are sequenced while still preserving the response-guided approach that is the hallmark of good clinical practice in applied behavior.|$|E

50|$|An <b>additional</b> <b>limitation</b> on {{unlocking}} {{the potential of}} the rifle was the availability of gunpowder, and the pursuant lack of training. Prior to the development of industrialized chemical plants producing copious amounts of gunpowder, in the mid-19th centuries, armies simply could not expend large amounts of gunpowder for training. As a result, the average infantryman simply did not have extensive firearms training beyond simple maintenance and loading drills. The infantryman simply {{did not know how to}} aim his rifle at long distances—eyewitnesses report entire companies aiming their rifles at a 45 degree angle facing the sky and discharging their rifles at Bull Run (Guelzo p. 59). Such untrained soldiers could not be expected to engage an enemy much further than point blank range with any level of accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Crossover {{experiments}} have several limitations. Although useful for distinguishing between proposed reaction mechanisms, they {{are limited in}} their ability to provide insight into a mechanism beyond what has already been proposed. The design of a useful crossover experiment relies on having a proposed mechanism on which to base predictions of the label distribution in the products. If the results do not match any expected outcome, the actual mechanism is not obvious from the crossover experiment results. An <b>additional</b> <b>limitation</b> is of course that some systems are just not suitable for crossover experiments. This could be the case if addition of a label alters the mechanism or stops the reaction entirely, if there is no proposed mechanism, if isotopic labels exchange with solvent molecules, or if it is not feasible to synthesize the labeled species necessary for a crossover experiment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{existence}} of AOHell and similar software even allowed AOL {{to develop its}} own warez community. Lurking in secret chat rooms with appropriate names like 'AirZeraw', mm, cerver, 'wArEzXXX', g00dz, 'punter', 'gif', 'coldice' 'GRiP' as well as 'trade' {{to name a few}} chatrooms, AOHell created bots often referred to as 'servers' which would send out a list of warez (illegally copied software) contained in their mailbox. [...] Simply messaging the bot with the titles of the desired software packaging would result in those packages being forwarded to one's mailbox. Since the data merely had to be copied into another user's mailbox (still resident on an AOL server), the piracy was only limited by how fast messages could be forwarded, with AOL footing all the bandwidth costs. One <b>additional</b> <b>limitation</b> included an allotted amount of email messages which could be sent per day by the particular user account.

5000|$|In August 1933, the {{publishing}} house History of Factories and Industrial Enterprises editorial board decided to commission {{a book on}} the construction of the White Sea - Baltic Sea Canal. Under the guidance and control of the Joint State Political Directorate (OGPU), {{the publishing}} house assembled a “Writers' Brigade” of 120 writers from across the Soviet Union who met in Moscow on August 17, 1933 for a pre-trip orientation where the head of the Belomor prison camp provided background information on the project. Maxim Gorky, though not a participant in the August orientation or tour of the construction site, was chosen as the head editor and leader of the writers' brigade. [...] Sailing from Leningrad, the writers began their weeklong tour toured the Canal zone later that month. Along the way, the writers were intended to have meetings with the “canalarmyists” (Russian: Kanaloarmeitsy from kanal, canal, and armeets, one who is part of the army) where they could interview the inmates and gain direct insight into the reformative aspects of the labor camp. However, most of the writers’ meetings were staged or tightly monitored and their observations were mostly done from afar. When writers did meet inmates, they were generally common criminals rather than political prisoners, who would have provided more critical views of the canal’s labor methods. [...] An <b>additional</b> <b>limitation</b> in the writers’ method of collecting information presented itself in the interviews with engineers which were performed through questionnaires delivered weeks to months after the trip itself rather than in person.|$|E
5000|$|Justice Marshall {{addressed}} the Commerce Clause issue first. The majority agreed with Commonwealth Edison's claim that, {{even though a}} tax is imposed before the goods become interstate commerce, {{this does not mean}} the tax evades constitutional analysis. Rejecting the reasoning in Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., 260 U.S. 245 (1922), the majority [...] "disapproved" [...] of any distinction between intrastate and interstate commerce {{based on the idea that}} the Commerce Clause denies states the right to burden interstate commerce, and concluded that state severance taxes came under the jurisdiction of the Constitution's Commerce Clause. The respondents argued that the appropriate test for evaluating a tax under the Commerce Clause should be the four-prong test set forth in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274 (1977), and that the Montana tax violated the third prong of the Complete Auto Transit test by discriminating against out-of-state consumers of Montana's coal. But the majority concluded no discrimination existed, because the tax burden was borne equally by all out-of-state consumers. The appellants also argued the tax violated the fourth prong of the test because it was not [...] "fairly related to the services provided by the State" [...] (e.g., the amount of the tax collected exceeds the cost of services provided). But the majority disagreed: Commonwealth Edison had fundamentally misconstrued the Court's test in Complete Auto. The Montana Supreme Court had characterized the severance tax as intended for general government purposes, a finding the U.S. Supreme Court refused to dispute. Thus, there could be no [...] "excessiveness" [...] test. Nor was there any question that the state of Montana had the right to levy the tax for the purposes it did. Justice Marshall next identified how the fourth prong of the Complete Auto test should be interpreted:The relevant inquiry under the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test is not, as appellants suggest, the amount of the tax or the value of the benefits allegedly bestowed as measured by the costs the State incurs on account of the taxpayer's activities. Rather, the test is closely connected to the first prong of the Complete Auto Transit test. Under this threshold test, the interstate business must have a substantial nexus with the State before any tax may be levied on it. See National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Illinois Revenue Dept., 386 U.S. 753 (1967). Beyond that threshold requirement, the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test imposes the <b>additional</b> <b>limitation</b> that the measure of the tax must be reasonably related to the extent of the contact, since it is the activities or presence of the taxpayer in the State that may properly be made to bear a [...] "just share of state tax burden," [...] Western Live Stock v.

Washington Revenue Dept., 419 U.S. 560 (1975).The Court held that the Montana severance tax easily met this test. The Court refused to decide whether a tax could ever be [...] "too high" [...] under the Constitution, leaving this judgment expressly to the legislative branch.|$|E
50|$|The West German {{shipping}} canals {{serve the}} mass transportation in the Ruhr region between the rivers Rhine and Ems direction North sea and via the Mittelland Canal to the Weser, Elbe, Oder and Vistula.This canal network shows the highest traffic density in Europe. The canals are state-owned by the Federal Waterways Authority (Bundeswasserstraßenverwaltung”).The construction of artificial shipping canals was {{necessary in the}} industrialisation period of the Ruhr due to lacking transportation routes via capable, navigable rivers. The oldest part, the Dortmund-Ems Canal, is connecting the eastern Ruhr since 1898 with the North Sea. In 1914 the connection to the Rhine followed via the Rhine-Herne Canal and the Datteln-Hamm Canal was opened, too. In 1930 the Wesel-Datteln Canal was finished. All these connected waterways need to bridge altitude differences between the starting point, the connected harbours and the arrival point. For these purposes there are today e.g at the Rhine-Herne Canal 5 sluices and at the Wesel-Datteln Canal 6 sluices; at the Henrichenburg boat lift two ancient and two actually utilized sluices facilitate the bypassing of the altitude difference within the Dortmund-Ems-Kanal to Dortmund harbour. To feed the planned canal system with water already in 1905 before {{the construction of the}} Datteln-Hamm Canal the decision was passed by the Prussian State to use 10 m³/second water from the river Lippe - the only relevant river in the area - for the compensation of evaporation, infiltration and loss of water from the sluices). That was leading from 1914 on to severe water management problems in the river Lippe where in dry summers only 4 m³/second water was left downstream. From 1926 on the newly established water board Lippeverband negotiated with the competent authorities and finally the governmental waterway administration (“Reichswasserstraßenverwaltung”) confirmed to reduce the water abstraction to 7,5 m³/second from 1938 on. The industrial development of the coal and steel industry and especially the coal-fired power stations after World War II meant a growing demand of service water (from the canals and the river Lippe) and a growing discharge of too warm and/or unsatisfactory treated waste water into the river Lippe. Negotiations of the Lippeverband with the government of North Rhine Westphalia and with the Federal Waterways Authority (Bundeswasserstraßenverwaltung) were finally from 1968 on leading to new regulations: The ’’Wasserverband Westdeutsche Kanäle’’ WWK was established, consisting of representatives of the Lippeverband and the water users, accompanied by the Federal Waterways Authority and the Environment Ministry of North Rhine Westphalia. Moreover, the permission for maximum discharge of the Lippe into the West German canal system was increased to 10 m³/second again but now with the <b>additional</b> <b>limitation</b> to guarantee a minimum discharge of 10 m³/second in the Lippe, too, otherwise the water abstraction for the canals had to be limited. This regulation was possible because of already constructed pumps at the sluices that started compensating partly the loss of water from locking.In the years 1973-1978 a series of new pumping stations was established that could serve the canals “upstream” from the rivers Rhine and Ruhr and discharge “downstream” in case the Lippe has enough water to supply with. Parallel pumping systems had been developed along the Rhine-Herne Canal and the Wesel-Datteln Canal/ Datteln-Hamm Canal, all controlled and supervised from a centralized telecontrol station.|$|E
