50|$|Brander and Lewis {{proposed}} a duopoly {{model in which}} it might be rational for the managers of a corporation to load up on debt, {{to a degree that}} would be socially dysfunctional. In the model, management might deliberately incur debts in order to wed its interests to those of the shareholders and pursue with their support a risky low-margin, high-output strategy that in turn may gain market share. This gamble has a chance of success if the other duopolist is low-risk, and would rather leave the market than engage in a price-cutting war. On the other hand, if both duopolists adopt the same approach, though, the result is that they are both worse off than if neither had. Furthermore, that result will have negative social utility—the <b>affected</b> <b>market</b> will resemble the recent airline industry in North America.|$|E

When national home prices increased at a faster pace, there was a shift from banks to mortgage brokers in local markets. Mortgage loans...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the empirical consequences of imposing binding minimum standard {{on the market}} for private health insurance for the elderly. This Medigap insurance is designed to supplement the public, universal health insurance provided through Medicare. In the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, states imposed regulations mandating that any Medigap policy sold through the non-group market must include at least a specified minimum set of benefits. I find robust evidence of a substantial "quality-quantity tradeoff" associated with these minimum standards. The central estimates suggest that the standards are associated with a 13 percentage point decrease in coverage in the <b>affected</b> <b>market.</b> This represents a two-fifths decline in coverage in the <b>affected</b> <b>market.</b> There is no evidence of substitution to other, unregulated sources of supplementary health insurance such as Medicaid or the group market for Medigap. I also find evidence that is consistent with the minimum standards reducing the provision of non-mandated benefits among those who retained insurance coverage. Taken together, the results on both extensive and intensive coverage margins indicate a substantial decrease in insurance coverage associated with minimum benefit standards. I calculate the change in the exposed risk distribution associated with the minimum standards and estimate that the imposition of minimum standards was, on net, welfare reducing.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} factors <b>affecting</b> <b>market</b> {{liquidity}} using a simulation model of an artificial market. We first survey definition of market liquidity {{and discuss the}} relationship between market liquidity and market efficiency or stability. We then consider a continuous auction market and discuss factors <b>affecting</b> <b>market</b> liquidity. Incorporating the discussion, we construct an artificial market model and conduct various simulations. We find that {{an increase in the}} ratio of market participants following short-term market price movements results in {{an increase in the number}} of trades and at the same time a decrease in the volume of accumulated order flows. When market participants become more risk-averse on average, market liquidity decreases. A precipitous decrease in market liquidity results when market participants lose confidence in their expectations on future prices. Changes in the sensitivities of traders to <b>market</b> information <b>affect</b> <b>market</b> liquidity, but various market liquidity indicators do not necessarily move in the same direction. These results suggest that change in market liquidity indicators may not always be consistent. * Views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the Bank of Japan, the Committee o...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine generic {{competition}} and market exclusivity periods for pharmaceuticals experiencing their initial generic entry between 1995 and 2005. We find that generic competition has increased over several dimensions. First, {{an increasing number}} of drugs are subject to generic entry, including drugs with relatively modest annual average sales. Second, drugs with larger sales attract more generic entrants and have shorter market exclusivity periods than smaller selling drugs. Third, blockbuster drugs with annual sales in excess of $ 1 billion have experienced significant decreases in their market exclusivity periods in recent years.

Three main results emerge. First, while there is some convergence in country-level market power during the pre-crisis period, the onset of the global crisis has put an end to this process. Second, bank-level market power appears to vary significantly with respect to ownership characteristics. Third, asset quality and capitalization affect differently the margins in the pre-crisis and crisis periods. While in the pre-crisis period the impacts are similar for all banks regardless of ownership status, in the crisis period non-performing loans have a negative effect and capitalization a positive effect only for domestically-owned banks...|$|E

Furthermore, standardization and harmonization stimulated the circulation of knowledge and the rise of a new field of knowledge organized around the standardized and harmonized issues.

30|$|Currently, the {{supplier}} switching process of retail {{customers in the}} German energy market takes several days up to 3 weeks, since it involves numerous steps of data exchange, validation and confirmation between all <b>affected</b> <b>market</b> roles. Therefore, switching intervals lower than a month cannot be reasonably realized in the current system, leading to contract durations of at least 1 month, usually 1 year. This reduces the flexibility of retail customers {{to adapt to the}} market setting, since {{it is not possible to}} make use of potentially more economic offers. Moreover, this can also pose market entry barriers for new player, since only a very limited share of customers are able to switch in a given interval of time, increasing the required time for new players to accumulate a competitive customer base. Therefore, the current system potentially prevents increased competition in the electricity retail market.|$|E

We compare hand-collected, restated SFAS 131 segment data for the final SFAS 14 fiscal year with the historical SFAS 14 data. We find that SFAS 131 increased the number of reported segments and provided more disaggregated information. Analysts and the market had access to a portion of the new segment information before it was made public, but analyst and market expectations were still altered by the mandated release of the new data. By increasing information disaggregation, the new standard induced firms to reveal previously "hidden" information about their diversification strategies.
