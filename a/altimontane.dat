The most commonly encountered forest type is the Hainsimsen beech forest. At heights above 700 m it is usually adjacent to spruce-beech mixed woodland. But in the national park this area has shrunk to just a few residual stands and has been largely replaced by spruce. In the region of Ilsenburg spruce monoculture occurs even down to [...] In these zones the spruce is not native and, as a result of climate change, it has suffered increasingly from bark beetle infestation. Currently the National Park Service is having these areas reforested to encourage the original beech and maple, that used to dominate them, to resettle.|$|E
40|$|On very steep {{dolomite}} slopes in {{the western}} foothills of the Kamnik Alps (Ravni hrib, Javorov vrh, Zaplata, Kriška gora) and southwestern Karavanke Mountains (Dobrča) we conducted a phytosociological study into montane grasslands (former hay meadows, partly pastures) where Gladiolus palustris, a species of European conservation concern, also occasionally occurs. They were compared with similar montane grasslands (former hay meadows) on sunny slopes of the Stol ridge above Breginj in the southwestern foothills of the Julian Alps. Based on this comparison we described three new syntaxa: Centaureo julici-Laserpitietum sileris gladioletosum palustris, Festuco amethystinae-Seslerietum calcariae and Pediculari julici-Bromopsietum transsilvanicae. Both new associations are classified into the alliance Caricion austroalpinae and treated as a long-term successional stage in the belt of <b>altimontane</b> beech forests from the association Ranunculo platanifolii-Fagetum...|$|E
40|$|Campanula tommasiniana is {{a typical}} {{chasmophyte}} occupying calcareous rock crevices and cracks along {{a wide range of}} ecological gradients, demonstrating a high degree of ecological plasticity and stress tolerance with regards to abiotic factors. Generally, three ecologically and floristically distinct groups of stands were recognized and typified according to a sigmatistic approach: (a) Seslerio juncifoliae-Campanuletum tommasinianae ass. nov., with stands occupying higher elevated sites fully exposed to sun and strong winds; (b) Seslerio autumnalis-Campanuletum tommasinianae ass. nov., representing stands predominantly developed within thermophytic beech stands, semi- to fully- shaded by the tree canopy; (c) Cystopteri fragilis-Campanuletum tommasinianae, sciophytic, stands adapted to moisture and coldwith high frequency and coverage of bryophytes. Results of DCA analyses using a unimodal model suggest that Campanula tommasiniana is primarily a plant of open and exposed sites of higher elevation despite being most frequently found in rock crevices within thermophytic and <b>altimontane</b> beech forests...|$|E
40|$|In the {{southern}} Julian Alps we described two communities whose tree layer {{is dominated by}} species from the genus Sorbus and noted two successional stages in the overgrowing of abandoned agricultural land (pastures, hay meadows). In the secondary succession on former subalpine pastures above the alp Planina Razor und under the Breginjski Stol ridge, where potential natural vegetation consists of subalpine beech forest, dwarf pine has been overgrown with mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia) whose stands are classified into the new association Rhododendro hirsuti-Sorbetum aucupariae. Whitebeam (Sorbus aria) has established itself on steep former hay meadows in the belt of <b>altimontane</b> beech forests under Mts. Jalovnik and Krikov Vrh, on gullied slopes on mixed geological bedrock dominated by chert, and these stands are classified into the association Calamagrostio arundinaceae-Sorbetum ariae. While occupying only small areas these two pioneer stages, as the sites of some rare or protected species, are nevertheless important biotopes and {{play a vital role}} in protection against avalanches...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{regeneration}} of <b>altimontane</b> spruce forests at Jelendol is retarded dueto many factors. In autumn 2003, gaps {{of different}} size {{and parts of}} the surrounding stand were covered with a 5 x 5 grid m to define sampling plots. Atotal of 227 plots with 1, 5 x 1, 5 m in size were installed to analyse generalregeneration conditions and inhibitors. The following ecological parameters were estimated on each plot: micro relief, inclination, soil depth,ground cover, direct and diffuse solar radiation. Woody regeneration (density, height, height increment) and ground vegetation were recorded at each plot. Considering that N-S and E-W radiation asymmetry was explicit, the distribution of direct and diffuse radiation was divided into four groups among the plots. Spruce regeneration (28., 605 per ha) was mainly found {{at the edge of the}} large gap, though total regeneration density and radiation were not correlated. However, in both the stand and the small gaps, the lack of radiation hindered further development. This study showed that light conditions were not the only factors affecting the regeneration success at an altitude of 1, 500 m. The presence of woody debris was important, while the influence of the herb layer (predominant species were Festuca altissima All. and Calamagrostis arundinacea (L.) Roth.) and soil depth proved to be negative. The impact of browsing, however, remained the main problem...|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic {{disturbance}} often drives habitat loss, ecological {{fragmentation and}} {{a decrease in}} biodiversity. This is especially problematic in islands, which are bounded and isolated systems. In the Azores, human settlement led to a significant contraction of the archipelago’s original native forested areas, which nowadays occupy only small patches and are additionally threatened by the spread of invasive species. Focusing on Terceira Island, this study aimed to assess the composition of vascular plant communities, and the abundance and distribution patterns of vascular plant species in permanent 100 m 2 plots set up in the best preserved vegetation patches along an elevational gradient (from 40 to 1000 m a. s. l.). Sampling yielded a total of 50 species, of which 41 are indigenous and nine are exotic. The richest and best preserved communities were found between 600 m and 1000 m, corresponding to Juniperus-Ilex montane forest and Calluna-Juniperus <b>altimontane</b> scrubland formations. Nonetheless, exotic species were prevalent between 200 m and 400 m, with Pittosporum undulatum clearly dominating the canopy. These results support the high ecological and conservation value of the vegetation formations found in the island’s upper half, while calling attention to the biological invasions and homogenization processes occurring at its lower half. Long-term monitoring in these plots will further reveal direction and rates of change in community composition, allowing for more informed management and conservation strategies in the island.

40|$|The {{largest and}} the most {{coherent}} complexes of natural spruce stands in Croatia are currently distributed in the <b>altimontane</b> and subalpine vegetation belt of Velebit over an area of 3165 ha and altitudes ranging from 1100 to almost 1600 m. Past phytocoenological research into spruce forests in northern Velebit distinguishes three different associations: frost valleys of Štirovača and Apatišanska Duliba support the <b>altimontane</b> spruce forest with bastard agrimony (Aremonio-Piceetum Horvat 1938), shallower sink holes and slopes descending from the surrounding tops contain the altimontane-subalpine spruce forest with Laserpitium krapfii (Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum Vukelić et al. 2010), while rocky tops, hips, karrens and ridges feature the subalpine spruce forest with small-reed (Calamagrostio variae-Piceetum Bertović 1975). These associations are distributed as azonal, microclimatically and edaphically conditioned associations, of which spruce forest with bastard agrimony occurs in the belt of Dinaric beech-fir forest (Omphalodo-Fagetum) while the two others grow in a higher belt of subalpine beech forest with buttercup (Ranunculo platanifoliae-Fagetum). Their mutual differences result from ecological factors which are decisive for their occurrence and distribution. Of these, the edaphic relationships which we explored in this work draw particular interest. Composite samples {{were taken from the}} top layer up to 5 cm deep (13 composite samples composed of 9 individual samples each), pedological profiles were opened (11 profiles), and soil samples were taken by pedogenetic horizons within pedological research in three spruce communities: <b>altimontane</b> spruce forest with bastard agrimony (Aremonio-Piceetum), altimontane-subalpine spruce forest with Laserpitium krapfii (Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum), and subalpine spruce forest with small-reed (Calamagrostio-Piceetum) in the area of northern Velebit and Štirovača. Composite samples, taken from the top soil layer up to 5 cm deep, consisted of 9 samples, each taken at a distance of 1 m in a cross pattern. Soil samples were analyzed by means of the following laboratory methods: determination of pH values (HRN ISO 10390 : 2005), determination of CaCO 3 content (HRN ISO 10693 : 2004), determination of organic and total carbon and nitrogen with dry combustion (HRN ISO 10694 : 2004, HRN ISO 13878 : 2004), determination of concentrations of Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd (HRN ISO 11466 : 2004), and determination of the granulometric soil composition (HRN ISO 11277 : 2004). Descriptive statistics were made for all the samples by the investigated phytocoenosis. Variance analysis was used to test the differences between the composite soil samples for the layer of up to 5 cm in depth. Statistica 7. 0 software was used for this purpose. The analyses of composite soil samples taken from a depth of 5 cm in three different spruce communities (Aremonio-Piceetum, Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum and Calamagrostio-Piceetum) showed than the lowest pH value was recorded in the community Aremonio-Piceetum, followed by the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum, while the highest value was recorded in the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum. The average pH (H 2 O) value in the community Aremonio-Piceetum reaches 4. 35, in Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum it is 5. 56 and in Calamagrostio-Piceetum it is 5. 23. In terms of pH values for soil depths of up to 5 cm, the communities Aremonio-Piceetum and Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum (pH H 2 O, p= 0. 01447; pH CaCl 2, p= 0. 01668) show a statistically significant difference. In all the communities the surface soil layer is richly humous and well supplied with nitrogen. It is the richest in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum, where the average value of C org amounts to 131. 6 g kg– 1 and N tot. to 9. 3 g kg– 1 (Table 3). The C : N ratio in all the three communities is favourable and ranges between 11 and 15. The average depth of the humus-accumulative horizon amounting to 6. 5 cm is the lowest in the community Aremonio-Piceetum. It is higher in the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum where it reaches 7. 5 cm and the highest in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum, where it is 21 cm. The content of pH values, C org., N tot. in the hummus-accumulative horizon shows similar values and an identical trend to composite soil samples at a depth of up to 5 cm. In terms of the argyle-accumulative and cambic horizon, the lowest pH value is observed in the community Aremonio-Piceetum, where the average pH (H 2 O) value is 5. 30. In the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum, the average pH (H 2 O) value is 6. 92. The highest pH value is observed in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum, where the average pH (H 2 O) value reaches 7. 21, but it is only one profile opened in the shallow and distinctly skeletal calcocambisol. All the soils have a texture ranging from silty to clayey loam. Soil reaction was the only parameter to show statistically significant differences for the top soil layer. These differences relate to the communities Aremonio-Piceetum and Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum. The lowest pH value in the community Aremonio-Piceetum is conditioned by acid parent material, flat relief which additionally favours the podzolization process in the perhumid climate, while specific microclimatic conditions, frost sites and high air humidity cause more intensive accumulations of raw humus. In relation to the pH reaction, the lowest acidity is displayed by the association Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum, as confirmed by phytocoenological research (Vukelić et al. 2010), according to which this community, compared to others, has the biggest number of species of the order Fagetalia. These species are dominant in adjacent, mainly neutrophilic beech and beech-fir forests. All the three studied communities, Aremonio-Piceetum, Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum and CalamagrostioPiceetum, manifested high Pb contamination in the surface soil layer of up 5 cm. The average Pb content (median) in the community Aremonio-Piceetum amounts to 54. 5 mg kg– 1, in the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum to 65. 0 mg kg– 1, and in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum to 54. 7 mg kg– 1. The top soil layer of 5 cm in the communities Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum and Calamagrostio-Piceetum also manifested high Zn and Cd contamination. The average content (median) in the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum for Zn is 101. 0 mg kg– 1 and for Cd it is 1. 0 mg kg– 1, whereas in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum it is 75. 0 mg kg– 1 for Zn and 1. 9 mg kg– 1 for Cd...|$|E
