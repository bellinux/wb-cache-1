The early years of the Cold War saw <b>a</b> <b>stark</b> divide between Capitalist ideologies, backed by NATO, and Communist satellite states of the Soviet Union. This divide encouraged the anti-Communist governments of Greece and Turkey to join NATO in 1952. Greece would suspend its membership in 1974, over the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, but rejoined in 1980 with Turkey's cooperation.|$|E

5|$|In the Pacific Northwest {{there is}} <b>a</b> <b>stark</b> {{contrast}} in Riesling production. The grape {{is currently on}} the rise in Washington State but on the decline in neighboring Oregon. Riesling from this area ranges from dry to sweet, and has a crisp lightness that bodes well for easy drinking. Often there will be an easily detectable peach and mineral complex. Some Washington State winemakers, such as Chateau Ste. Michelle, are adapting German-style Riesling production methods, and even partnering with well-known German vintners like Dr. Ernest Loosen to create specialty wines such as the Eroica Riesling. With annual productions of over 2,000,000 cases a year, Chateau Ste. Michelle is the worldwide leader in the production of Riesling wines by volume. In 2007 Pacific Rim Winemakers, another Pacific Northwest winery and owned by Randall Grahm of Bonny Doon, has built the first wine facility in Red Mountain AVA dedicated completely to Riesling production.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Wheatfield, NY429 heads across {{populated}} but less developed areas on its way to a junction with US62. North of this point, the closely spaced homes gradually give way to more isolated houses and, eventually, rural farmland. It continues on a north–south line to the town of Lewiston and the hamlet of Sanborn, located adjacent to the Lewiston–Cambria town line. In the small but developed community, NY429 follows Buffalo Street past three blocks of homes to a junction with NY31 (Saunders Settlement Road). Buffalo Street ends here; however, NY429 joins NY31 for two blocks east to Townline Road, a north–south highway delimiting the boundary between Lewiston and Cambria. NY429 continues north on Townline Road, passing the sprawling main campus of Niagara County Community College, <b>a</b> <b>stark</b> departure from the rural fields that NY429 traversed in Wheatfield.|$|E
5|$|Tetragrammaton {{issued the}} album in <b>a</b> <b>stark</b> {{gatefold}} sleeve, wrapped {{around with a}} segmented illustration from Hieronymus Bosch's painting The Garden of Earthly Delights.

The original painting is in colour although it appeared on the LP in monochrome due to a printing error for the original layout and the band opted to keep it that way. Another section of the same Bosch painting (in colour) had previously been used as an album cover two years before by Pearls Before Swine on their debut One Nation Underground.|$|E

5|$|The keel for Roma {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Cantiere della Foce {{shipyard}} in Genoa in February 1863. She was launched on 18 December 1865, and fitting-out work was finished by May 1869. By the time she entered service, other navies had begun to build casemate ships, rendering Roma obsolescent almost immediately after she was completed. In addition, the Italian naval budget was drastically reduced following the defeat at Lissa in 1866, which reflected <b>a</b> <b>stark</b> decrease in the government's confidence in the fleet. As a result, she saw little use during her career; indeed the budget was reduced so significantly that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of Civitavecchia in September 1870, {{as part of the}} wars of Italian unification. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors conscripted to man them were sent home.|$|E
5|$|The lantern as {{a source}} of {{illumination}} in art was widely used by Baroque artists, and perfected by Caravaggio. Traditionally a dramatic light source and the resultant chiaroscuro were used as metaphors for the presence of God. Illumination by torch or candlelight took on religious connotations; but in The Third of May the lantern manifests no such miracle. Rather, it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work, and provides <b>a</b> <b>stark</b> illumination so that the viewer may bear witness to wanton violence. The traditional role of light in art as a conduit for the spiritual has been subverted.|$|E

5|$|The Leopold Report, officially {{known as}} Wildlife Management in the National Parks, is a 1963 paper {{composed}} {{of a series of}} ecosystem management recommendations that were presented by the Special Advisory Board on Wildlife Management to United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall.

5|$|Because its {{coloration}} {{is similar}} to Bendire's thrasher, the two birds are easily mistaken for one another. The bill of the curve-billed is all black, while that of Bendire's is paler down to the lower mandible, showing a dark grey with a basal area that does not feature <b>a</b> <b>stark</b> contrast. The upper and lower mandibles of the curve-billed are curved, while the upper is curved and lower is essentially straight for the Bendires'. Although geographic variances for the curve-billed can make discerning breast patterns difficult, the curve-billed {{has a tendency to}} display larger and rounder spots overall on its breast, in contrast to the Bendires' smaller, more pronounced markings shaped like arrowheads. However, curve-billed thrashers can also present this feature. Bendires' typically have yellow eyes while curve-billed eyes are typically orange, but Bendires' can have variations that appear yellow-orange while some curve-billed eyes are red-orange, yellow-orange, or yellow. The curve-billed is heavier and is more likely to inhabit suburban regions; Bendires' are likely to avoid dense vegetation such as mesquite and prefers open grassland with scattered yucca or around hedgegrows in agricultural areas. The song call of Bendire's is said to be more melodic and continuous with a chuck, while the curve-billed is known for its whit-wheet calls.|$|E
5|$|For many scholars, {{the scene}} at 6.34 seems to {{anticipate}} and parallel the confrontation between Theodosius and Ambrose in 390; Erasmus used the two situations as parallel exempla in a letter written to Francis I in 1523. That later event has been taken as evidence against Philip's Christianity. Even in the later 4th century, {{in a society that}} had already been significantly Christianized, the argument goes, Theodosius' humiliation had shocked the sensibilities of the aristocratic elite. It is therefore inconceivable that 3rd century aristocrats, members of a society that had experienced only partial Christianization, would accept such self-abasement from their emperors. Shahîd contests this parallel, and argues that Philip's scene was far less humiliating than Theodosius': it did not take place against the same background (Theodosius had massacred seven thousand Thessalonicans some months before), no one was excommunicated (Theodosius was excommunicated for eight months), and it did not involve the same dramatic and humiliating dialogue between emperor and bishop. Philip made a quick repentance at a small church {{on his way back to}} Rome from the Persian front, <b>a</b> <b>stark</b> contrast to the grandeur of Theodosius' confrontation with Ambrose.|$|E
5|$|He {{appeared}} in many lead rôles, including Don Jose in Roland Petit's Carmen, Franz in Coppélia, Basil and Espada in Don Quixote, Albrecht in Giselle, Romeo in Romeo and Juliet, Prince Siegfried in Swan Lake, James in La Sylphide, Prince Desire in Sir Kenneth MacMillan's Sleeping Beauty and lead rôles in George Balanchine's Stravinsky Violin Concerto, Symphonie Concertante and Theme and Variations. He created the rôle of the Prince in Mikhail Baryshnikov's production of Cinderella, the leading male rôle in Antony Tudor's The Tiller in the Fields (1978), Glen Tetley's Contredances (1979), the title rôle of Peter Darrell's Chéri (1980) {{and the lead}} rôle in Lynne Taylor-Corbett's Estuary (1983). In 1984, Bissell starred as a guest artist with the Universal Ballet Company in its first production, Adrienne Dellas's Cinderella. He was partnered by its leading ballerina and general director, Julia Moon. He also performed as a guest artist with the National Ballet of Canada, Scottish Ballet and Pacific Northwest Ballet.
