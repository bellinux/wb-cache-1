This {{performance}} <b>attracted</b> <b>interest</b> from the press, and his times in the 200 m and 400 m led to him being touted as a possible successor to Johnson. Indeed, at sixteen years old, Bolt had reached times that Johnson did not register until he was twenty, and Bolt's 200 m time was superior to Maurice Greene's season's best that year.|$|E

Potential suitors {{included}} Blackpool (where Frank's elder brother Fred was the goalkeeper), Blackburn Rovers, Bradford City and Manchester City. The first to offer Swift a contract were Manchester City, who played in the First Division, the highest level of English football. Initially signed as an amateur in October 1932, eighteen-year-old Swift turned professional the following month, receiving a wage of ten shillings (50p) per week. The following December he was called up to the first team, having previously made only three reserve team appearances.|$|E

The principle was discovered by a Canadian professor, Edmund Godfrey Burr, in 1940. It <b>attracted</b> <b>interest</b> because it could help to hide ships from submarines in the ongoing Battle of the Atlantic, and the research project began early in 1941. The Royal Navy and the US Navy carried out further equipment development and trials between 1941 and 1943.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Franck {{moved to}} the United States, where he had {{accepted}} a professorship at Johns Hopkins University. The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared {{to the one in}} Göttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more intractable problem was that the university had no money to hire skilled staff. Franck was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and needed money to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the University of Chicago, where his work on photosynthesis had <b>attracted</b> <b>interest,</b> in 1938.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of the 2001–02 season saw Drogba make 11 {{appearances}} and score three goals for Guingamp. While his contributions helped the club avoid relegation, the coaching staff remained unconvinced of their new young striker. However, the next season he rewarded his coaches' patience, scoring 17 goals in 34 appearances and helping Guingamp finish seventh, a record league finish. He credited his teammates for his impressive season, highlighting the contributions of winger Florent Malouda, a long time friend of Drogba, as a key factor in his goalscoring prolificity that season. His strong goal scoring record <b>attracted</b> <b>interest</b> from larger clubs {{and at the end of}} the season, he moved to Ligue 1 side Olympique de Marseille for a fee of £3.3million.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} nine, Zakuani <b>attracted</b> <b>interest</b> from West Ham United's youth program.

His off-the-field issues culminated in serious injuries when {{he was involved in}} a crash while riding on a moped that one of his friends had stolen. Zakuani was unable to play for 18months. After losing interest in soccer and renewing his efforts in school, his teacher and mentor Paul Goodison took him to watch motivational speaker and evangelist Myles Munroe. This inspired Zakuani to renew his commitment to becoming a professional player and, although unsuccessful, he tried out for the senior teams of Queens Park Rangers, Wigan Athletic, AZ Alkmaar, and Real Valladolid.|$|E

5|$|Born in Sheffield, England, Boulding {{excelled at}} both {{football}} and tennis, but chose {{to adopt the}} latter after he was spotted by coach Tony Pickard, who trained Boulding for 10years. However, having continued to train as a footballer and play in the non-league with Hallam, he finished his tennis career in 1999, when he turned a professional footballer with Mansfield Town. He played {{for two years in}} Division Three with Mansfield, before he moved up two divisions to Grimsby Town. After scoring 11goals in a season with Grimsby, he <b>attracted</b> <b>interest</b> from Premier League-side Aston Villa. However, his stay with Villa was short-lived and his only first team action was in the Intertoto Cup, before he returned to Grimsby. He spent another two years with Grimsby and then another two with Barnsley, before he decided to retire in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Boulding {{worked in}} the family {{business}} but returned to football in March 2006, with Rotherham United. He did not play for Rotherham in two months and instead returned to Mansfield Town, along with his brother, Rory, {{at the end of}} the season. Boulding scored just six goals in his first season with Mansfield. However, after he scored 25 in his second season, when the team were relegated from The Football League, he <b>attracted</b> <b>interest</b> from a number of League One and Two clubs. He eventually decided to join Bradford City, again with his brother, but the pair were released early from their contracts after less than two years with the club. The brothers were given trials back at Mansfield Town, but while Rory joined Accrington Stanley, Michael returned to Barnsley on short-term deal and later had a similar contract at Derby County but never featured in either first team. He has also been involved with running the family's property business.|$|E

Three more goals followed {{by the end of}} 2005 including one on Boxing Day against Hull City, who then offered him a permanent deal. Hull and Manchester United agreed a fee for Johnson but he decided to extend his loan deal at Crewe {{until the end of the}} 2005–06 season. It was not until the last game of the season against Millwall that he scored another to bring his tally to five from 22games. Having failed to make an impact at Manchester United, Johnson was among seven United players given a free transfer at the end of the 2005–06 season. He was offered a contract at Crewe, but also <b>attracted</b> <b>interest</b> from Barnsley and Bradford City, the latter of whom he joined on a two-year deal in June 2006.|$|E

5|$|José Antonio Camacho led Benfica {{to another}} second-place finish and broke an eight-year title drought; he <b>attracted</b> <b>interest</b> from Real Madrid, who signed him in late May. As a replacement, Benfica unsuccessfully inquired after Luiz Felipe Scolari for the position. After much speculation, Benfica {{announced}} they had recruited Giovanni Trapattoni, the Italian national team's former manager. Benfica signed more players than the year before, but only Quim, Manuel dos Santos and Azar Karadas became regular first-team fixtures. The most significant departure {{was that of}} Tiago, {{who had been a}} regular for the past two seasons. Because their second-place finish only granted a place in the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, Benfica had to play Anderlecht for a place in the group stage. A 3–1 loss on aggregate led to relegation to the 2004–05 UEFA Cup. Between both legs, Benfica contested and lost the 2004 Supercup with Porto.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Tasci <b>attracted</b> <b>interest</b> from clubs around Europe. Stuttgart's league rival Hamburger SV as well as foreign clubs such as Tottenham Hotspur and Juventus {{reportedly}} expressed their desire to sign him. This move was denied by his agent; he said that Tasci would stay at Stuttgart only. On 15 July 2010, Tasci expressed his desire to stay at the club. After being excluded from the opening game of the season, he made his first appearance in a 3–2 loss against Borussia Dortmund. He scored his first goal for the club in the Europa League group stage matchday one in a 3–0 win over Young Boys. He then suffered a thigh problem that kept him out for a long time. In late November, Tasci returned to training with a bandage on his right knee. Once again, he was on the sideline after experiencing ongoing problems with his thigh injury despite reporting himself fit. He returned to the field on 19 December 2010 in the match against Bayern Munich, which Stuttgart lost 5–3. Despite his injury, Tasci would go on to make 26 league appearances. He continued to attract interest from Zenit Saint Petersburg, Tottenham, Málaga and Arsenal.|$|E
