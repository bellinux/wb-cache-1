40|$|In {{the early}} 1930 s, Richard Shope {{isolated}} influenza virus from infected pigs. Shope’s finding was quickly {{followed by the}} isolation of the influenza virus from humans, proving that a virus —not a bacterium, as was widely believed— caused influenza. In 1892, German bacteriologist Richard Pfeiffer isolated what he thought was the causative agent of influenza. The culprit, according to Pfeiffer, was a small rod-shaped bacterium that he isolated from the noses of flu-infected patients (1). He dubbed it Bacillus influenzae (or Pfeiffer’s bacillus). Few doubted the validity of this discovery, in large part because bacteria had been shown to cause other human diseases, including anthrax, cholera, and plague.

The <b>antisera</b> had been obtained from cattle which were vaccinated with larval and gut extracts of B. microplus, and which were subsequently protected (84 % and 94 % respectively) against challenge with B. microplus. One of the mAbs (QU 13) has been demonstrated to precipitate protective antigens from the midgut of B. microplus. Gut antigens from all ten isolates displayed similar reactivity profiles against bovine <b>antisera</b> <b>and</b> also against mAbs in Western blots.

Larval membrane antigen extracted from N-strain B. microplus reacted with QU 13 in dot-ELISA, indicating that protective antigens are common to both larval and adult stages of B. microplus.

40|$|Twenty-two known {{strains of}} the Bacteroides fragilis group of organisms and 67 {{clinical}} specimens {{from a variety of}} sites were examined by fluorescent antibody test (IFA) using two different antisera fro the rapid detection of B fragilis group of organisms. A previously reported Barts' pooled antisera was compared with a commercially produced Fluoretec kit <b>antisera</b> <b>and</b> the findings were related to routine anaerobic culture and gas liquid chromatography for short chain fatty acids. The Barts' antisera was more sensitive (88 %) but less specific (88 %) than the kit (sensitivity 50 %, specificity 98 %). This indicates that Barts' antisera picks up more positive cultures than the kit. The predictive value of a positive test was 82 % for Barts' <b>antisera</b> <b>and</b> 93 % for the kit. There were higher numbers of false-negatives with the kit (13 / 26) than with the Barts' (3 / 26).

Test results were compared with results of tests using antisera produced at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta, Ga. All strains (three isolates {{of each of the}} 22 serotypes) were typeable with the CDC antisera. Of 66 test strains, 39 (59 %) were typed as the same serotype with both sets of antisera. Twenty-four strains (36 %), including two heat-labile serotype reference strains, were nonreactive with the commercial <b>antisera,</b> <b>and</b> three strains (4. 5 %) were typed as serotypes different from those obtained with CDC antisera. Five of the 22 commercial antisera correctly serotyped all homologous strains.

40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} H 5 N 1 {{avian influenza}} A viruses display a remarkable genetic and antigenic diversity. We examined {{to what extent}} genetic distances between several H 5 N 1 viruses from different clades correlate with antigenic differences <b>and</b> <b>vaccine</b> performance. H 5 -specific <b>antisera</b> were generated, <b>and</b> cross-reactivity and antigenic distances between 12 different viruses were determined. In general, antigenic distances increased proportional to genetic distances although notable exceptions were observed. Antigenic distances correlated better with genetic variation in 27 selected, antigenically-relevant H 5 residues, than in the complete HA 1 domain. Variation in these selected residues could accurately predict the antigenic distances for a novel H 5 N 8 virus. Protection provided by vaccines against heterologous H 5 N 1 challenge viruses indicated that cross-protection also correlates better with genetic variation in the selected antigenically-relevant residues than in complete HA 1. When time is limited, variation at these selected residues {{may be used to}} accurately predict antigenic distance <b>and</b> <b>vaccine</b> performance...|$|R

40|$|Neutralization of the {{infectivity}} of Chlamydia trachomatis {{was assessed}} by using polyclonal <b>antisera</b> <b>and</b> monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Polyclonal <b>antisera</b> <b>and</b> a species-reactive MAb {{as well as a}} subspecies-specific MAb, both of which were directed toward the major outer membrane protein of C. trachomatis, reduced the number of chlamydial inclusion-forming units in an in vitro assay. Neutralization was dependent on the presence of complement. The species-specific MAb reacted with all 15 serovars by a microimmunofluorescence assay and a dot blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with heat-treated elementary bodies. On the other hand, this same MAb reacted with all serovars, except those in the C complex, by the dot blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with viable organisms and neutralized in vitro all 10 serovars tested, except those in the C complex. When neutralization assays were performed in a solution containing Mg 2 +, neutralization by both polyclonal <b>antisera</b> <b>and</b> MAbs was significantly reduced. A dose response to Mg 2 + supplied as MgSO 4 revealed that all concentrations tested from 50 to 800 microM had some effect. Concentrations of {{greater than or equal to}} 400 microM MgSO 4 completely abolished neutralization at the lowest dilution of polyclonal <b>antisera</b> <b>and</b> species-reactive MAb tested. Although Mg 2 + also blocked the neutralization effect of the subspecies-specific MAb, this neutralization was not as complete as that observed with the species-reactive MAb. Addition of Mg 2 + to the assay over the initial 45 min of incubation of C. trachomatis with MAb and complement showed that the organisms could be rescued to some extent over the first 30 min of incubation, after which time neutralization of infectivity could not be reversed. C. trachomatis treated with Mg 2 +, the species-reactive MAb, and complement were lethal to mice in an in vivo toxicity and infectivity assay, whereas mice injected with organisms incubated with the same MAb and complement without Mg 2 + survived...|$|R

Rabbit antisera raised against either the first hypervariable region or ectodomain of E 2 showed limited and strain specific neutralization. By contrast, the monoclonal antibody (MAb) AP 33 demonstrated potent neutralization of infectivity against HCVpp carrying E 1 E 2 representative of all genotypes tested. The concentration of AP 33 required to achieve 50 % inhibition of infection by HCVpp of diverse genotypes ranged from 0. 6 to 32 μg/ml. The epitope recognized by MAb AP 33 is linear and highly conserved across different genotypes of HCV.
