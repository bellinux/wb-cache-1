40|$|Summary {{objective}} To {{compare the}} yield of active tuberculosis (TB) case detection <b>among</b> <b>risk</b> <b>groups</b> during home visits with passive detection among patients at health services. methods In April 2004, {{in a first}} phase, we introduced, active screening for coughing among all family members of patients that were visited at home by their family doctor or nurse for other reasons. Subsequently, from October 2004 onwards, active screening was restricted to family members belonging to groups at risk of TB. results The overall detection rate of TB increased from 6. 7 ⁄ 100 000 during passive detection at health services before the intervention to 26. 2 ⁄ 100 000 inhabitants when passive detection was com-plemented by active case finding. Active screening <b>among</b> <b>risk</b> <b>groups</b> yielded 35 TB cases per 1000 persons screened compared to 20 TB cases per 1000 persons passively screened at health services. Active case finding was particularly efficient in those coughing for 3 weeks or more (107 ⁄ 1000 screened). conclusion This study demonstrates that active case finding in groups at risk during home visits increases the case detection rate in the population and permits the identification of cases {{that may not be}} detected through passive case finding at health facility level...|$|E

Objectives: To assess the yield of TB screening using an algorithm with smear microscopy followed by Xpert® MTB/RIF. Design: A descriptive study using routinely collected data. Results: Of 145 679 individuals screened, 28 574 (19. 6 %) had presumptive TB; 1239 (4. 3 %) of these were diagnosed with TB and 1195 (96 %) were initiated on anti-tuberculosis treatment. The yield of screening was highest among people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) (6. 1 %), followed by household contacts (3. 5 %) and urban slum dwellers (0. 5 %). Among other risk groups, such as prisoners, factory workers, refugees and individuals with diabetes, the yield was less than 0. 5 %. The number needed to screen to diagnose an active TB case was 17 for PLHIV, 29 for household contacts and 197 for urban slum dwellers. Of 11 525 patients from ICF and the routine programme, 112 (1 %) were diagnosed with multidrug-resistant TB. Conclusion: There was a substantial yield of TB cases <b>among</b> <b>risk</b> <b>groups</b> such as PLHIV and household contacts.

In 2008 / 09, 27 / 29 countries completed the survey; in 2009 / 10 and 2010 / 11, 28 / 29 completed it. All or almost all countries recommended vaccination of older people (defined as those aged >/= 50, >/= 55, >/= 59, >/= 60 or >/= 65 years), and people aged >/= 6 months with clinical risk and healthcare workers. A total of 23 countries provided vaccination coverage data for older people, but only 7 and 10 had data for the clinical risk groups and healthcare workers, respectively. The number of countries recommending vaccination for some or all pregnant women increased from 10 in 2008 / 09 to 22 in 2010 / 11. Only three countries could report coverage among pregnant women. Seasonal influenza vaccination coverage {{during and after the}} pandemic season in older people and clinical groups remained unchanged in countries with higher coverage.

Results At the time of auto-SCT, 74. 6 % and 25. 4 % of patients had achieved complete remission and partial remission after R-CHOP, respectively. As a whole, the 5 -year overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 78. 8 % and 74. 2 %, respectively.

There was carried out molecular-genetic study of the polymorphic locus Т 3801 С of gene CYP 1 A 1 and polymorphic locus A 313 G of gene GSTP 1 in adolescent-smokers with recurrent and chronic bronchitis. It is established that TТ genotype of the polymorphic locus Т 3801 С of gene CYP 1 A is a marker of resistance to the development of this pathology in adolescent-smokers. The presence of CC genotype of the polymorphic locus Т 3801 С of gene CYP 1 A 1 and GG genotype of polymorphic locus of A 313 G GSTP 1 gene may be considered as a possible risk factor for the development of chronic inflammatory process in bronchopulmonary system.

In this paper, we identify a number of characteristic features of influenza incidence time series in temperate regions, including ranges of annual attack rates and outbreak durations. By constraining the output of simple models to match these characteristic features, we investigate {{the role played by}} population heterogeneity, multiple strains, cross-immunity and the rate of strain evolution in the generation of incidence time series. Results indicate that an age-structured model with non-random mixing and co-circulating strains are both required to match observed time-series data. Our work gives estimates of the seasonal peak basic reproduction number, R 0, in the range 1. 6 – 3. Estimates of R 0 are strongly correlated with the timescale for waning of immunity to current circulating seasonal influenza strain, which we estimate is between 3 and 8 years. Seasonal variation in transmissibility is largely confined to 15 – 30 % of its mean value. While population heterogeneity and cross-immunity are required mechanisms, the degree of heterogeneity and cross-immunity is not tightly constrained.

However, we saw no differences in pathological stage, type of surgery (BCS versus mastectomy), number of positive lymph nodes, or tumor size <b>among</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>groups</b> (Table  1). When we stratified the CP factors by type of surgery (BCS versus mastectomy), we observed no significant differences according to RS <b>risk</b> <b>group,</b> tumor grade, LVSI, or chemotherapy use. However, patients who underwent mastectomy tended to have larger primary tumors (P[*]=[*]. 0069) and more hormone therapy use (P[*]=[*]. 0406) than did patients who underwent BCS.|$|R
