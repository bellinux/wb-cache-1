This was almost my undoing because after I had garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the {{property}} of Barnard College at Columbia, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>I</b> was the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard wanted me to take, not what I wanted to learn. Fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that Barnard decided I could not belong to it and I was therefore allowed to continue getting an education.|$|E
500|$|Shelley Conn plays Danni Prendiville, {{an officer}} with Section 20. Porter started {{an affair with}} her after he was redrafted into service. She signed on for the role because she [...] "thought {{the concept of the}} scripts was very clever <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>I</b> heard who was {{involved}} it didn't take me long to sign up." [...] In researching for her role, Conn had somewhat of a military background since her father and uncle both served in the British Army, and had since had a base understanding of military life.|$|E

I've been a fan of his fiction for 25 years, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>I</b> started into the act of working with his creations, it had an extra special excitement to me," [...] {{he said in an interview}} with The Washington Post. [...] "Aside from the content in his message, and the fact that he's the founder of the Church of Scientology and Dianetics, the thing I loved about Hubbard was the aesthetics of his writing. There is a musical wavelength to what he does," [...] said Corea to The San Diego Union-Tribune.|$|E

500|$|Gordon {{was chosen}} as the showrunner for the series by Killen. Gordon commended the pilot script at first glance. Gordon {{originally}} read the script on a flight to New York City. [...] "I read the pilot, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>I</b> got past my envy, I was struck by the voice," [...] he stated. [...] "So few writers have real voices. Kyle is disarmingly self-effacing; and at the same time, he's disarmingly confident. It's that duality thing: On the one hand, he's open; on the other, he's closed." [...] Gordon later compared the television series to The Good Wife. He said that The Good Wife has so many procedural aspects that you have to decide which format to use each week. He compared it to Awake, saying, then, [...] "What makes an Awake episode?" [...] "Pilot" [...] was written by Killen, and directed by David Slade.|$|E
500|$|Following Jackson's {{death in}} June 2009, {{there were reports}} that Jackson had left the Beatles {{catalogue}} to McCartney in his will, having added it just five months before. (Jackson was reportedly expecting to die before McCartney despite being 16 years his junior due to various health problems.) However, it was later revealed that Sony/ATV Music Publishing would keep control of the Beatles' songs. Upon his death, Jackson's entertainment attorney, Joel Katz, commented on the singer's work as a businessman. [...] "Michael Jackson was a perfectionist and his business affairs are worldwide. Many of them are quite ongoing and will be dealt with appropriately." [...] Ivan Thornton, a private-wealth adviser who worked with Jackson and his family, also commended the business side of the musician. [...] "His business mind was fascinating. We'd go to meetings with bankers and Wall Street people <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>I</b> explained the language to him, he totally got it. There was no formal education there, but his natural knack was off the charts." ...|$|E

500|$|In late 2010, Owumi's agent Goran Gramatikov was {{approached}} by another agent looking for players of African descent to play professional basketball in Libya. By December 27, 2010, Owumi had signed a lucrative deal with Al-Nasr, a team from Benghazi that played in the top Libyan league, and was arriving in the country. Despite fears of the country's instability {{in the midst of}} the budding Arab Spring and discouragement from his girlfriend Alexis Jones, he chose to remain with the team, prompted by the poor conditions in Macedonia. He later said, [...] "The most important thing was to get out of the bad situation I was in, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>I</b> had the opportunity to get some place better to play basketball, that's all I really cared about. I didn't really care about the team, I cared about the money and that it was going to be on time and that I was going to be able to further my career and get to feed my family." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{can only}} {{remember}} {{bits and pieces}} of the game. I was psyched. I had a feeling of euphoria. I was zeroed in on the [...] glove, but I didn't hit the glove too much. I remember hitting a couple of batters, and the bases were loaded two or three times. The ball was small sometimes, the ball was large sometimes, sometimes I saw the catcher, sometimes I didn't. Sometimes, I tried to stare the hitter down and throw while I was looking at him. I chewed my gum until it turned to powder. I started having a crazy idea in the fourth inning that Richard Nixon was the home plate umpire, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>I</b> thought I was pitching a baseball to Jimi Hendrix, who to me was holding a guitar and swinging it over the plate. They say I had about three to four fielding chances. I remember diving {{out of the way of}} a ball I thought was a line drive. I jumped, but the ball wasn't hit hard and never reached me.|$|E
500|$|... "Heavy Competition" [...] {{was written}} by Ryan Koh and {{directed}} by Ken Whittingham. It was the fifth of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire. Elba {{said he did not}} watch the episode after it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, so I try not to torture myself." [...] Rainn Wilson said he liked the episode because it demonstrated growth for his character and the relationship between Michael and Dwight; he said [...] "I like the way they let characters grow and change on the show," [...] and said of his character, [...] "It's not the same acolyte ass kissing as season 2". Wilson said the moment Dwight spun around the HarperCollins secretary saying [...] "Spin move", which was included in the script, {{was one of the most}} popular moments of the episode among the writers. Wilson said of filming the move, [...] "We did like five spin moves <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>I</b> did a somersault. I thought I was being all nimble and quick, but no.

500|$|Boudreau {{discussed}} the potential move to pitcher with Yankees catcher Bill Dickey, {{who had also}} played in the Navy with Lemon. [...] "I knew Lemon had a strong arm, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>I</b> realized {{he was not going}} to hit with consistency as an outfielder, I thought it would be worthwhile to look at him as a pitcher", Boudreau later wrote. Lemon resisted the idea at first, but he agreed to the change after he learned that his salary could be higher as a pitcher. Lemon credited Indians coach Bill McKechnie with helping him to adjust to his new position. Indians pitching coach Mel Harder taught Lemon how to throw a slider, a key pitch in his repertoire. That same year, Indians owner Bill Veeck said that Lemon [...] "some day will become the best pitcher in the American League." [...] Lemon finished the 1946 season with a losing record (4–5), the only one he would have until 1957, and a career-low 2.49ERA. He followed up his inaugural season as a pitcher with an 11–5 record. He appeared in 19 games before August, largely as a relief pitcher, but he made his first start in July against the Boston Red Sox. During the last two months of the season, Lemon went 9–3 and pitched six complete games, including two 11-inning outings.|$|E
2500|$|Anderson {{moved to}} Los Angeles in 1992, {{and spent a}} year auditioning.

Although she had once vowed she would never do television, being {{out of work for}} a year changed her mind. Anderson recalled: [...] "First of all, I swore I'd never move to Los Angeles, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>I</b> did, I swore I'd never do television. It was only after being out of work for almost a year that I began going in [...] on some stuff that I would pray that I wouldn't get because I didn't {{want to be involved in}} it." [...] She broke into mainstream television in 1993, with a guest appearance on the collegiate drama, Class of '96, on the fledgling Fox Network.|$|E
2500|$|On February 6, 2012, Bryant passed O'Neal for fifth {{place on}} the all-time scoring list. Bryant {{said it was an}} honor because of their championships together. O'Neal congratulated Bryant, saying [...] "I'm proud of him. I'm happy for him. And, most of all, I want to thank him for being a part of the {{greatest}} 1-2 punch ever created, never to be duplicated." [...] Bryant stated on radio the following day that he and O'Neal were never going to last as teammates. Bryant recalled: [...] "There was an interview that I heard Shaq do which he kind of threw down the challenge of me not being able to win without him. After I read that, I said, 'Aw, that's it.' Some comparison that he made with me and Penny Hardaway, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>I</b> read that, I said, 'You know what? I can't finish my career with people saying that. There's no way.'" [...] In 2013, Bryant said that the two [...] "have a really, really good relationship now", calling it [...] "a good lesson for all of us." [...] He said the two had [...] "mutual respect" [...] for each other, while O'Neal commented that they had an [...] "athletic dislike" [...] for each other but [...] "never had a real dislike". That year, the Lakers retired O'Neal's No. 34 during a halftime ceremony. [...] Bryant did not attend the ceremony, but called O'Neal [...] "the most gifted physical specimen I've ever seen play this game" [...] in a recorded video during the event. [...] Questioned about his absence, Bryant told the media, [...] "I appreciate you guys trying to start some stuff for old times' sake." [...] Later, it came out that Bryant had missed the ceremony because he had been receiving treatment from the Lakers' training staff.|$|E
