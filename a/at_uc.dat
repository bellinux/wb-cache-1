40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{and compare the}} characteristics of commonly used types of traditional and heat-activated initial archwires at different temperatures by plotting their load/deflection graphs and quantifying three parameters describing the discharge plateau phase. Materials and Methods: Forty-eight archwires of cross-sectional diameters ranging from 0. 010 inches to 0. 016 inches were obtained from seven different manufacturers. A modified three-point wire-bending test was performed on three analogous samples of each type of archwire <b>at</b> 55 <b>uC</b> and 5 uC, simulating an inserted archwire that is subjected to cold or hot drinks during a meal. For each resulting load/deflection curve the plateau section was isolated and the mean value of each parameter {{for each type of}} wire was obtained. Results: Permanent strain was exhibited by all wires tested <b>at</b> 55 <b>uC.</b> Statistically {{significant differences were found between}} almost all wires for the three considered parameters when tested <b>at</b> 55 <b>uC</b> and 5 uC. Loads were greater <b>at</b> 55 <b>uC</b> than <b>at</b> 5 <b>uC.</b> Differences were also found between traditional and heat-activated archwires, the latter of which generated longer plateaus <b>at</b> 55 <b>uC,</b> shorter plateaus <b>at</b> 5 <b>uC,</b> and lighter mean forces at both temperatures. The increase in average force seen with increasing diameter tended to be rather stable at both temperatures. Conclusions: All nickel-titanium wires tested showed a significant change related to temperature in terms of behavior and force for both traditional and heat-activated wires. Stress under high temperatures can induce permanent strain, whereas the residual strain detected at low temperatures can be recovered from as temperature increases...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} how high temperature affects viral transcription, the absolute amounts of mRNA for six bacteriophage wX 174 genes were compared <b>at</b> 37 <b>uC</b> and 42 <b>uC</b> using Q-PCR. <b>At</b> 37 <b>uC,</b> mRNA levels for all genes {{were consistent with}} previous studies, but <b>at</b> 42 <b>uC</b> mRNA levels for four genes were significantly different from levels <b>at</b> 37 <b>uC.</b> Transcript levels were higher for genes B and D; the promoter before gene B appears to be up-regulated at high temperature. Levels for genes F and G were reduced at high temperature, possibly due to increased efficiency of the transcription termination signal immediately upstream of gene F. These functional changes in wX 174 gene regulation at high temperature have not been described previously. Studies of phage evolution at high temperatures indicate that this difference in transcript levels is subject to adaptation...|$|R

40|$|Background: Transient {{receptor}} potential (TRP) cation {{channels are}} involved in the perception of hot and cold pain and are targets for pain relief in humans. We hypothesized that agonists of TRPV 1 and TRPM 8 /TRPA 1, capsaicin and menthol, would alter nociceptive behaviors in the rat, but their opposite effects on temperature detection would attenuate one another if combined. Methods: Rats were tested on the Orofacial Pain Assessment Device (OPAD, Stoelting Co.) at three temperatures within a 17 min behavioral session (33 uC, 21 uC, 45 uC). Results: The lick/face ratio (L/F: reward licking events divided by the number of stimulus contacts. Each time there is a licking event a contact is being made.) is a measure of nociception on the OPAD and this was equally reduced <b>at</b> 45 <b>uC</b> and 21 uC suggesting they are both nociceptive and/or aversive to rats. However, rats consumed (licks) equal amounts <b>at</b> 33 <b>uC</b> and 21 <b>uC</b> but less <b>at</b> 45 <b>uC</b> suggesting that heat is more nociceptive than cold at these temperatures in the orofacial pain model. When menthol and capsaicin were applied alone they both induced nociceptive behaviors like lower L/F ratios and licks. When applied together though, the licks <b>at</b> 21 <b>uC</b> were equal to those <b>at</b> 33 <b>uC</b> and both were significantly higher than <b>at</b> 45 <b>uC.</b> Conclusions: This suggests that the cool temperature is less nociceptive when TRPM 8 /TRPA 1 and TRPV 1 are co-activated...|$|R

5|$|Heins {{discusses}} the Supreme Court case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, a landmark {{on affirmative action}} for minority students in university and college admissions. The case (decided in 1978) upheld affirmative action in the admission of minority students as one of several factors to consider, not the primary one. In the lawsuit, the affirmative-action standards <b>at</b> <b>UC</b> Davis School of Medicine were challenged; the school had a policy of holding 16 out of 100 slots for minorities in the incoming class of students, regardless of qualification. Potential student Allan Bakke, a qualified white applicant, challenged the practice after he {{was rejected by the}} school. In an opinion written by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., the court ruled against racial quotas at the school while allowing minority status to remain one of several criteria in the admissions process.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, with Babcock's support, Stebbins {{was made}} a full {{professor}} in the Department of Genetics <b>at</b> <b>UC</b> Berkeley, after the Department of Botany failed to promote him. Stebbins was required to teach a course on evolution, and during his preparation he became excited by contemporary research combining genetics and evolution. He became associated with a group known as the Bay Area Biosystematists, which included botanist Jens Clausen, taxonomist David D. Keck, physiologist William Hiesey and the evolutionary geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky. During this time he also became friends with the botanist Herbert Baker. With the encouragement of this group of scientists, Stebbins directed his research towards evolution. He became involved with the Society for the Study of Evolution in 1946, {{and was one of}} the few botanists involved with the new organization.|$|E

Stebbins discusses the origins, genetics and developmental biology of the angiosperms. He argues for the role of adaptive radiation in the diversification of the angiosperms and the usefulness of applying our current understanding of species' genetics and ecology to gain knowledge about the evolution of ancient species. He also wrote Processes of Organic Evolution, The Basis of Progressive Evolution, Chromosomal Evolution in Plants and the textbook Evolution with co-authors Dobzhansky, Francisco Ayala and James W. Valentine. His last book, Darwin to DNA, Molecules to Humanity was published in 1982.|$|E

40|$|The mevalonate-based isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway is {{responsible}} for producing cholesterol in humans and is used commercially to produce drugs, chemicals, and fuels. Heterologous expression of this pathway in Escherichia coli has enabled high-level production of the antimalarial drug artemisinin and the proposed biofuel bisabolane. Understanding the kinetics of the enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway is critical to optimize the pathway for high flux. We have characterized the kinetic parameters of phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK, EC 2. 7. 4. 2) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a previously unstudied enzyme. An E. coli codon-optimized version of the S. cerevisiae gene was cloned into pET- 52 b+, then the C-terminal 6 X His-tagged protein was expressed in E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) and purified on a Ni 2 + column. The KM of the ATP binding site was determined to be 98. 3 mM <b>at</b> 30 <b>uC,</b> the optimal growth temperature for S. cerevisiae, and 74. 3 mM <b>at</b> 37 <b>uC,</b> the optimal growth temperature for E. coli. The KM of the mevalonate- 5 -phosphate binding site was determined to be 885 mM <b>at</b> 30 <b>uC</b> and 880 mM <b>at</b> 37 <b>uC.</b> The Vmax was determined to be 4. 51 mmol/min/mg enzyme <b>at</b> 30 <b>uC</b> and 5. 33 mmol/min/mg enzyme <b>at</b> 37 <b>uC.</b> PMK is Mg 2 + dependent, with maximal activity achieved at concentrations of 10 mM or greater.
