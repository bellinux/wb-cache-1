Under different wind profiles, the mass fractions of CO 2 in the horizontal and vertical directions are different.

40|$|Abstract In {{recent years}} field {{experiments}} have been {{undertaken in the}} lower atmosphere to perform a priori tests of subgrid-scale (SGS) models for large-eddy simulations (LES). The experimental arrangements and data collected have facilitated studies of variables such as the filtered strain rate, SGS stress and dissipation, and the eddy viscosity coefficient. However, the experimental set-ups did not permit analysis of the divergence of the SGS stress (the SGS force vector), which is the term that enters directly in the LES momentum balance equations. Data from a field experiment (SGS 2002) in the west desert of Utah, allows the calculation of the SGS force due to the unique 4 × 4 sonic anemometer array. The vector alignment of the SGS force is investigated under a range of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>stabilities.</b> The eddy viscosity model is likely aligned with the measured SGS force under near-neutral and unstable conditions, while its performance is unsatisfactory under stable conditions.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} second-order closure meteorological and {{pollutant dispersion}} model is developed, and the computed results are evaluated. A finite-element method is used to solve the governing equations because of its versatility in handling variable-resolution meshes and complex geometries. The one-dimensional version of this model is used to simulate a 24 -h diurnal cycle for a horizontally homogeneous atmospheric boundary layer in neutral, stable, and unstable stratifications. The simulated turbulence fields under a convective boundary layer act as the background turbulence for simulating cases of three-dimensional pollutant dispersion from elevated point sources. The simulated turbulence and pollutant distribution compared well with experimental observations and with other numerical models, ensuring {{the validity of the}} adopted mathematical formulation as well as the developed model. The computed results provide an overview of turbulence structures in different <b>atmospheric</b> <b>stabilities</b> and are helpful to enhance understanding of the characteristics of air pollutant dispersion, such as plume rise and descent in a convective boundary layer.

The accident happened in Paese, near Treviso (Italy) in March 1996 and was characterized by complex phenomena due to a choked release of LPG from a tanker. There was a dispersion of light winds and, after about 40 minutes, a flash-fire throughout followed by a transient jet release and BLEVE (boiling-liquid-expanding-vapour explosion). The evolution of these phenomena was studied by application of some available models. The primary purpose of these applications was to check the possible use and the efficiency of the simulation models using comparisons and evidence on the dynamics of the accident. Another purpose was to get more detailed information on the dynamics of the accident. The work was done in collaboration with the Fire Brigade of Rovigo, the University of Padova and ARTES (consulting on risk analysis – Mirano – Venezia).

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} {{investigate}} turbulent diffusion in a deciduous forest canopy, wind velocity measurements were conducted from late autumn of 2009 to early spring of 2010, using an observation tower 20 m in height {{located in the}} campus of Kanazawa University. Four sonic anemometers mounted on the tower recorded the average wind velocities and temperatures, {{as well as their}} fluctuations, at four different heights simultaneously. Two different types of data sets were selected, in which the wind velocities, wind bearings and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>stabilities</b> were all similar, but the Leaf Area Indexes (LAI's) were different. Vertical profiles of average wind velocities were found to have an approximately exponential profile in each case. The characteristic length scales of turbulence were evaluated by both von Karman's method and the integral time scale deduced from the autocorrelation from time-series analyses. Both methods produced comparable values of eddy diffusivity for the cases with some foliage during late autumn, but some discrepancy in the upper canopy layer was observed when the trees did not have their leaves in early spring. It was also found that the eddy diffusivities generally take greater values at higher positions, where the wind speeds are large. Anisotropy of eddy diffusivities between the vertical and horizontal components was also observed, particularly in the cases when the canopy does not have leaves, when the horizontal eddy diffusivities are generally larger than the vertical ones.

40|$|East African {{precipitation}} {{is characterized}} by a dry annual mean climatology compared to other deep tropical land areas and a bimodal annual cycle with the major rainy season during March–May (MAM; often called the ‘‘long rains’’) and the second during October–December (OND; often called the ‘‘short rains’’). To explore these distinctive features, ERA-Interim data are used to analyze the associated annual cycles of <b>atmospheric</b> convective <b>stability,</b> circulation, and moisture budget. The atmosphere over East Africa is found to be convectively stable in general year-round but with an annual cycle dominated by the surface moist static energy (MSE), which is in phase with the precipitation annual cycle. Throughout the year, the atmospheric circulation is dominated by a pattern of convergence near the surface, divergence in the lower troposphere, and convergence again at upper levels. Consistently, the convergence of the vertically integratedmoisture flux is mostly negative across the year, but becomes weakly positive in the two rainy seasons. It is suggested that the semiarid/arid climate in East Africa and its bimodal precipitation annual cycle {{can be explained by the}} ventilation mechanism, in which the <b>atmospheric</b> convective <b>stability</b> over East Africa is controlled by the import of lowMSE air from the relatively cool IndianOcean off the coast. During the rainy seasons, however, the off-coast sea surface temperature (SST) increases (and is warmest during the long rains season) and consequently the air imported into East Africa becomes less stable. This analysis may be used to aid in understanding overestimates of the East African short rains commonly found in coupled models. 1...|$|R
