25|$|On 12 July 2012, {{the judge}} Prithviraj Fekna told the jurors {{not to worry}} about what ramifications any verdict may have on the {{reputation}} of Mauritius. He reminded the six men and three women that they were not politicians and it was not their job to protect the image of the country. You have been told that this will have an international ramification and will affect the image of Mauritius… this is not your role, Fekna said. You must not <b>allow</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> be influenced by this, you are not politicians, you have to base yourself on what has happened.|$|E
25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What {{is the job}} of a recon leader? To recon the front line – no man’s land. And what did we do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. Look around you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not <b>allow</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. You are here. If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, I doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E

2500|$|While {{they were}} both collaborating on {{translating}} Rabindranath Tagore from Bengali into Russian, Pasternak advised Ivinskaya, [...] "1) Bring out {{the theme of the}} poem, its subject matter, as clearly as possible; 2) tighten up the fluid, non-European form by rhyming internally, not {{at the end of the}} lines; 3) use loose, irregular meters, mostly ternary ones.

You may <b>allow</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> use assonances.". Later, while collaborating with him on a translation of the Czech language poet Vítězslav Nezval, Pasternak told Ivinskaya, [...] "Use the literal translation only for the meaning, but do not borrow words as they stand from it: they are absurd and not always comprehensible. Don't translate everything, only what you can manage, and by this means try to make the translation more precise than the original—an absolute necessity in the case of such a confused, slipshod piece of work." ...|$|E

2500|$|Keys {{began working}} on the album in May 2009. During this time, Keys and her audio {{engineer}} bought several vintage keyboards, describing the Moog as her [...] "special best friend". Recording took place in The Oven Studios in Long Island, New York. Keys expressed that she [...] "didn't know what to do" [...] when she {{began working on}} the album, but knew to do it. After exhausting herself, she stated that she [...] "finally found the key, {{and that is to}} <b>allow</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> be free". She explained that the album dealt with overcoming depression. She went on to say, [...] "I found more freedom. Before, I thought I could only show the strong side of me. Now there’s a mixture of strong and delicate. A new sound, a new emotion. That’s a lot of who I am right now" [...] Recording for the album was completed between August and September 2009. Keys described that she [...] "love melody so much", but approached the album with a [...] "free zone". The album includes production by Kerry [...] "Krucial" [...] Brothers, Jeff Bhasker, Noah [...] "40" [...] Shebib and Swizz Beatz.|$|E
2500|$|Baum's {{fairy tale}} {{contains}} many other allusions to American {{life in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries. For instance, Dorothy's loyal companion, Toto, could be a play on [...] "teetotalers" [...] which {{is a person who}} never drinks alcohol. The prohibitionists deemed alcohol consumption should be unlawful and they were longtime political allies of Populists during the late 19th century. Toto trots [...] "soberly" [...] behind Dorothy on their adventure. The Winged Monkeys have been thought to resemble the Plains Indians who were [...] "once free people" [...] but were now enslaved by the Wicked Witch of the West. Their actions can be good or bad depending on how they are controlled; however, they [...] "belong to this country alone" [...] and therefore cannot leave, as can be said for American Indians. The Yellow Winkies that inhabit the Land of the West could represent Asian workers in California during the gold rush; their harsh work environment can be seen as enslavement. The lenses that the groups must wear before entering the City of Oz to dim the emeralds' shine turn out to be fake, like the Wizard. The Emerald City is not a city made of emeralds but a plain, white city where the emerald color lenses cast a green hue on everything and everyone. This shows that anything can be made to look spectacular if you <b>allow</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> be tricked. Baum traveled all over the United States and would have been introduced to all these events in the 19th century, making it very likely that he drew inspiration from the land around him.|$|E
2500|$|Fitzmaurice found [...] "Polish Girl" [...] to {{be similar}} to the song [...] "Reunion" [...] by Canadian band Stars, as both songs depict someone trying to recover, and yearning for, young love. Palomo asks {{questions}} in the song that are likely to be unanswered, such as [...] "Do I still cross your mind?/ Your face still distorts the time". Cooke noted the [...] "dazzling syncopated pulse" [...] {{to be similar}} to the coin sound effect in games from the Mario series, and has melodies that [...] "splash and slide around sickly-sweet flurries of arpeggios and a family-friendly feel-good beat". Blurt said that the song includes what sounds like samples from the game Super Mario World, and has the joyful energy of Cut Copy's album Zonoscope. Beats per Minute writer Aurora Mitchell said the song [...] "sounds like 80s disco distorted through an old computer", while AllMusic noted the song sounded more like Palomo's other project Vega than Neon Indian. [...] "The Blindside Kiss" [...] includes elements of alternative rock, grunge and garage rock. Club Fonograma writer Blanca Méndez said that [...] "The Blindside Kiss" [...] is about the [...] "staying-at-home-and-staring-at-ceilings early stage" [...] of a breakup, which is [...] "the one in which you <b>allow</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> wallow in the pain because you deserve at least that much". Méndez noted the song's [...] "tinny layers of sound" [...] and Palomo's [...] "breathy, almost frustrated vocals". The electro-shoegaze song [...] "Hex Girlfriend" [...] addresses an ex-girlfriend, and includes video game synth timbres similar to those on Psychic Chasms opener [...] "(AM)". Both [...] "The Blindside Kiss" [...] and [...] "Hex Girlfriend" [...] are filled with [...] "buzzsaw"-toned guitars, which BBC Music's John Aizlewood compared to the Jesus and Mary Chain.|$|E

50|$|The last {{theme that}} seems very {{prominent}} {{at the end}} of the cycle is the idea of keeping this tragedy as a memorial.

This again ties back into the stages of suffering, so it is all interconnected.|$|R
