This study was an attempt to better understand the classroom <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> grading practices of teachers, which have previously been described as a 2 ̆ 2 hodgepodge 2 ̆ 2 mix of student attitude, effort and achievement. Specifically, the following questions regarding teachers 2 ̆ 7 <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> grading practices were addressed: What is the current state of <b>assessment</b> practice <b>and</b> grading by teachers? What <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> grading topics do teachers identify as needs to be addressed in in-service? What is the relationship between <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> grading practices and grades given to students?

5|$|James Campbell refutes {{suggestions}} that the hides given for each tribe were {{the sum of}} a system of locally-collected <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> argues that a two-tier system of assessment, one for large areas such as kingdoms and a more accurate one for individual estates, may have existed. He considers the possibility that many of the tribes named in the Tribal Hidage were no more than administrative units and that some names did not originate from a tribe itself but from a place from where the people were governed, eventually coming to signify the district where the tribe itself lived. Barbara Yorke suggests that the -sætan/sæte form of several of the place-names are an indication that they were named after a feature of the local landscape. She also suggests the tribes were dependent administrative units and not independent kingdoms, some of which were created as such after the main kingdoms were stabilized.|$|E

5|$|Kriegseisen {{notes that}} the {{institution}} of the sejmik gained a negative reputation following the partitions of Poland, and it has been described as one of the dysfunctional elements of the Polish political system that contributed to the fall of the Commonwealth. He cautions against such simplistic <b>assessments,</b> <b>and</b> traces them to 18th century publications whose negative views of the sejmiks have been rarely challenged since. The stereotype of a group of drunken, fighting nobility, found in some literature, should not be seen as representative, particularly outside the period of the sejmik's decline in the 18th century. He argues that while many sensationalist descriptions of debauchery, brawling or outright bloody violence at sejmiks have survived, they did so because they were just that—sensationalist—and should be seen as exceptions to the long, uneventful, but usually constructive proceedings that were much more common.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow Helsinki Group {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E

5|$|This {{practice}} was replaced in 1900 by {{a far more}} complex system of <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> donations designed {{to raise the money}} to support strikes. This system was replaced in 1901 because it was impractical. The 1901 system required every local union and the central committee to create strike funds. Local unions would receive support for strikes from Berlin under certain circumstances, and the central Business Committee's fund would be replenished by all member organizations in amounts proportional to their membership and the average wage of their members. This system, too, proved problematic because it penalized the larger, wealthier unions— especially the construction workers in Berlin who had higher wages but also higher costs of living. From 1901 to 1903, many small organizations joined the federation, yet the FVdG's membership fell as the punitive strike support system drove some larger unions out. In 1903, the federation not only changed its name to the Free Association of German Trade Unions but also decided to return to the old system of voluntary contributions. This system remained in place until 1914. The Business Committee worked to ensure that unions contributed as much as they could. Often the committee resorted to threatening unions with expulsion in order to raise funds for a strike. Fritz Kater called this a dictatorship necessary for the movement, but local organizations still had far more autonomy than their counterparts in other German labor federations.|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} {{reform movement}} {{has focused on}} classroom <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> grading practices as a potential means to improving teaching and learning. Many researchers agree {{that the best way}} to enhance learning for a diverse range of students is through appropriate, reliable, <b>and</b> valid classroom <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> grading practices. This is of particular importance in Saskatchewan because the inclusive philosophy has been mandated for all schools. Classroom teachers are responsible for the instruction, <b>assessment,</b> <b>and</b> grading of students with mild disabilities, learning, emotional, and behavioral challenges, and other needs that require specific attention. This study examined secondary classroom teachers’ <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> grading practices in one urban school division. A survey instrument adapted from the work of Duncan and Noonan (2007) and McMillan (2001) asked current secondary teachers, within inclusive classrooms, to indicate their current <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> grading practices. Evidence from the survey demonstrated that teachers in this division have diverse <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> grading practices and that they have begun to explore the potential for assessment to assist all students in their learning. This study has provided data to move forward with some professional development opportunities for teachers and further research in <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> grading with particular focus on students with special needs in inclusive classrooms...|$|R
