40|$|Peripheral nerve {{conduction}} velocities {{were determined}} in 12 patients hospitalized with chronic alcoholism. These patients {{did not have}} clinical evidence of peripheral neuropathy and were admitted because of acute and chronic alcoholic intoxication. Five of these patients were younger, had been drinking for a shorter time, had no clinical evidence of nutritional deficiency, and had not suffered alcoholic withdrawal syndromes; their peripheral nerve conduction velocities were normal. The only change {{was an increase in}} latency of the H reflex (a monosynaptic response recorded from calf muscles by electrical stimu-lation of the posterior tibial nerve).

40|$|It was {{hypothesized}} that a metabolite of morphine, morphine- 3 -glucuronide (M 3 G), contributes to the expression of symptoms seen during withdrawal from morphine. To test this hypothesis, the behaviors observed during precipitated withdrawal from morphine and sufentanil were compared. Sufentanil was chosen because, like morphine, it acts primarily at the mu opioid receptor, but has different metabolites. Differences in the <b>abstinence</b> <b>syndromes</b> produced by the two drugs may therefore be attributable to the actions of metabolites, rather than the primary opioid actions of morphine and sufentanil. Although there were some differences in the occurrence of symptoms, morphine and sufentanil withdrawal were very similar. Therefore, the evidence was inconclusive as to the contribution of metabolites during withdrawal. Systemic administration of M 3 G alone and in combination with morphine produced no withdrawal-like behaviors. However, when these drugs were given centrally, withdrawal-like behaviors were observed in conjunction with seizures. The seizures were not attenuated by naloxone (but were alleviated by an anti-convulsant), indicating {{that they were not}} mediated by opioid receptors. The behaviors resembled those seen by previous investigators following high doses of morphine. The results suggest that M 3 G {{may play a role in}} the toxic effects of high doses of morphine...|$|R
25|$|A {{withdrawal}} syndrome {{is seen in}} about 20% of pediatric intensive care unit children after infusions with benzodiazepines or opioids. The likelihood of having the syndrome correlates with total infusion duration and dose, although duration {{is thought to be}} more important. Treatment for withdrawal usually involves weaning over a 3- to 21-day period if the infusion lasted for more than a week. Symptoms include tremors, agitation, sleeplessness, inconsolable crying, diarrhea and sweating. In total, over fifty withdrawal symptoms are listed in this review article.

40|$|Summary Any {{decision}} on maternal pharmacotherapy should be balanced, comparing maternal and fetal/neonatal outcome to withholding any treatment. This {{is because there}} is a relevant body of evidence that uncontrolled maternal conditions also affect fetal outcome. The same holds true for breastfeeding. Drugs are not thoroughly evaluated for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Knowledge on safety of drugs exposure during fetal and neonatal (breastfeeding) life is limited. Pregnancy category classifications for drugs are currently used, but have their limitations. Pregnancy exposure registries to build knowledge have been implemented in the recently revised version of the FDA labelling guidelines (Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule). Suggestive indicators of ‘likely safe during breastfeeding’ are (i) drugs commonly administered to infants, (ii) drugs that are not absorbed following oral administration, (iii) not excreted into human milk, and finally (iv) drug considered safe during pregnancy, since fetal exposure is generally longer and more extensive. Aspects of opioids, benzodiazepines, and anti-epileptics use during fetal life or via breastfeeding have been discussed to illustrate the concepts of pregnancy related clinical pharmacology, followed by a focused discussion on neonatal <b>abstinence</b> <b>syndromes.</b> We hereby aim to provide the practicing clinician with some guidance and sources of information. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report the results of a study of the time course of the {{development}} of physical dependence on bar-biturates. It is known that withdrawal symptoms may appear following a very brief period of intoxi-cation with opiate-like drugs (Wikler et at., 1953; Martin and Eades, 1961, 1964). Martin and Eades, for example, were able to precipi-tate a characteristic withdrawal syndrome in dogs by administering nalorphine after only 8 hours of morphine infusion. Signs of increased excitability have also been described after rela-tively short periods of ethanol intoxication. McQuarrie and Fingl (1958) observed a low-ered threshold for pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures 8 hours after a single large dose of ethanol. It is widely believed that the rate of development of physical dependence on barbitu-rates follows a relatively slow time course, requiring many weeks or months to attain a level that will be manifested in a significant withdrawal syndrome. However, previous ex-perimental studies of physical dependence on barbiturates have usually employed barbital because of its slow excretion and long duration of action (e. g., Essig and Flanary, 1959; Seevers and Tatum, 1931). It is generally true of both barbiturates and opiates that the drugs with the longest duration of action produce <b>abstinence</b> <b>syndromes</b> characterized by long latency to onset, generally protracted time course, and less intense abstinence symptoms Received for publication April 6, 1964. 1 A preliminary report of this work was delivered at the June 1962 meeting of the Pavlovian Society, and was delivered to the American Society fo...|$|R

5000|$|In 1964, at Rockefeller Institute (now {{known as}} Rockefeller University), Dole and Nyswander {{initially}} treated six addicts {{during the first}} year, but {{the results of this}} work [...] "were sufficiently impressive to justify the trial of maintenance treatment of heroin addicts admitted to open medical wards of general hospitals in the city." [...] By 1967 over 300 patients were receiving daily doses of methadone, a potent synthetic opioid with an especially long half-life. [...] "After the patients had reached the stabilization level (80 to 120 mg/day methadone) it was possible to maintain them with a single, daily, oral ration, without further increase in dose." [...] Dole's patients not only largely stopped heroin use, they expressed an interest in family, friends, work, and becoming fully engaged members of society once more. Though psychiatrists were available counseling was not mandatory. Dole found that the shift of priorities from daily drug-cravings and the endless quest to keep the <b>abstinence</b> <b>syndrome</b> at bay restored to these individuals an inherent sense of self-worth; they resumed family responsibilities as well as employment. The doctors noted that although methadone satisfied the physical cravings of heroin addiction, patients soon became completely tolerant to its effects. Patients would remain [...] "dependent" [...] on methadone but could otherwise live normally. [...] Habituation results from exposure to any stimulus for long enough. The body always strives for homeostasis or balance, which is why the sudden withdrawal of methadone, morphine, alcohol, cigarettes, precipitates what is called the withdrawal <b>abstinence</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2013, the Senate Bill 495 passed, {{leading to}} the {{establishment}} of the Texas Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force to assess the factors contributing to maternal death in the state and suggest measures to reducing its incidence.

Since opioids are the most common method of drug abuse in Texas, the Task Force has initiated the Neonatal <b>Abstinence</b> <b>Syndrome</b> Prevention Pilot to reduce the incidence of this syndrome in newborns resulting from maternal opioid use. The Task Force is also working toward extending the number of days after delivery to which a woman in the Healthy Texas Women program can access health services.|$|E
50|$|The {{treatment}} of opioid-dependent persons with methadone will follow {{one of two}} routes. MMT (methadone maintenance therapy) is prescribed to individuals who wish to abstain from illicit drug use but have failed to maintain abstinence from opioids for significant periods. The duration of methadone maintenance ranges from {{a few months to}} lifelong. Methadone reduction programs are suitable for addicted persons who wish to completely stop using drugs. The length of the reduction program will depend on the starting dose and speed of reduction, this varies between clinics and from person to person. In addition, enrollment in methadone maintenance has the potential to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases associated with opiate injection, such as hepatitis and HIV. The principal goals of methadone maintenance are to relieve opioid cravings, suppress the <b>abstinence</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and block the euphoric effects associated with opioids. However, methadone abuse does carry the potential for dependence. When used correctly, methadone maintenance {{has been found to be}} medically safe and non-sedating, and provides a slow recovery from opioid addiction. It is also indicated for pregnant women addicted to opioids.|$|E
50|$|The Finnegan {{scoring system}} {{is used to}} {{quantify}} and diagnose neonatal withdrawal or abstinence (NAS) syndrome. This is a withdrawal syndrome of infants, caused by the cessation of the administration of licit or illicit drugs. Neonatal <b>abstinence</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is a group of}} problems that occur in a newborn who was exposed to addictive opiate or other drugs in utero. There are two types of NAS: prenatal and postnatal. Prenatal NAS is caused by discontinuation of drugs taken by the pregnant mother, while postnatal NAS is caused by discontinuation of drugs directly to the infant. The Twenty-one of the signs of withdrawal are scored. The scoring assessment is based upon the pathological significance and severity of the symptoms. Symptoms can be managed with medication. Though lengthy, it remains when used by trained clinicians. Bias and subjectivity can have some affect. The Finnegan scale is also used to assess the effectiveness of treatment and recovery of the infant. Assessment is performed and then scored. A daily score is calculated. The decision to treat the infant may be based upon a higher score. The Finnegan scale is used with assessment of comorbidities, prematurity, and clinician experience to guide treatment.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms often begin within 1 to 3 {{days after}} birth, but may {{take up to}} a week to appear. Because of this, the baby will most often need to stay in the {{hospital}} for observation and monitoring for {{up to a week}}.Withdrawing from different drugs, including prescribed medications, and nicotine from smoking produces its own signs and symptoms in the infant. Neonatal <b>abstinence</b> <b>syndrome</b> may occur when a pregnant woman takes drugs such as heroin, codeine, oxycodone (Oxycontin), methadone or buprenorphine. Benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and certain antidepressants (SSRIs) can cause dependence in the infantwhile in the womb. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms in the neonate is dependent upon the route of administration used by the mother (injection vs inhalation). The metabolism and elimination of the drug from the mother's system, and the length of time that the drug was taken will also impact the development of withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. More severe findings may include acting irritable or jittery, feeding problems, and diarrhea. Symptoms vary depending on which substances were used. A history of substance of abuse in the mother before the birth increases the likelyhood that the infant will develop symptoms of withdrawal.|$|E
50|$|Methadone {{maintenance}} treatment (MMT), {{a form of}} opioid replacement therapy, reduces and/or eliminates the use of illegal opiates, the criminality associated with opiate use, and allows patients to improve their health and social productivity. In addition, enrollment in methadone maintenance {{has the potential to}} reduce the transmission of infectious diseases associated with opiate injection, such as hepatitis and HIV. The principal effects of methadone maintenance are to relieve narcotic craving, suppress the <b>abstinence</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and block the euphoric effects associated with opiates. Methadone maintenance {{has been found to be}} medically safe and non-sedating. It is also indicated for pregnant women addicted to opiates.Methadone {{maintenance treatment}} is given to addicted individuals who feel unable to go the whole way and get clean. For individuals who wish to completely move away from drugs, they can start a methadone reduction program. A methadone reduction program is where an individual is prescribed an amount of methadone which is increased until withdrawal symptoms subside, after a period of stability, the dose will then be gradually reduced until the individual is either free of the need for methadone or is at a level which allows a switch to a different opiate with an easier withdrawal profile, such as suboxone. Methadone toxicity has been shown to be associated with specific phenotypes of CYP2B6.|$|E
