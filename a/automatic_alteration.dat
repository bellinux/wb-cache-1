Details of the model are included in template statements that enable the replacement of data fields with parameters. The use of parameters permits the <b>automatic</b> <b>alteration</b> of design variables within predefined bounds. The solver input-parameterised file precludes the need for importing the complete Abaqus model environment (.cae file).|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} solution of very large overdeter-mined algebraic polynomial systems on an example that appears from a classification of all integrable 3 -dimensional scalar discrete quasilinear equations Q 3 = 0 on an elementary cubic cell of the lattice Z³. The overdetermined polynomial algebraic system {{that has to be}} solved is far too large to be formulated. A ‘probing ’ technique which replaces independent variables by random integers or zero allows to formulate subsets of this system. An <b>automatic</b> <b>alteration</b> of equation formulating steps and equation solving steps leads to an iteration process that solves the computational problem...|$|E

This strategy integrates 3 D body scanning and 3 D visualising techniques to allow <b>automatic</b> pattern <b>alterations,</b> based {{not only on}} human body measurements, {{but also on the}} fabrics’ dynamic properties and features. The 3 D virtual try-on integration will actually present the exact idolised avatar of the customer virtually dressed. Scan data and patterns will be automatically transferred through ERP web-enabled interfaces direct to the enterprise’s manufacturing operations and facilities, and will be stored separately for each customer in order to create its ID profile which will be applicable for future purchases or reorders...|$|R
40|$|Standards and {{guidance}} for developing trustworthy clinical practice guidelines are now available, {{and a number}} of leading guidelines adhere to the key standards. Even current trustworthy guidelines, however, generally suffer from a cumbersome development process, suboptimal presentation formats, inefficient dissemination to clinicians at the point of care, high risk of becoming quickly outdated, and suboptimal facilitation of shared decision-making with patients. To address these limitations, we have [...] in our innovative research program and nonprofit organization, MAGIC (Making GRADE the Irresistible Choice) [...] constructed a conceptual framework and tools to facilitate the creation, dissemination, and dynamic updating of trustworthy guidelines. We have developed an online application that constitutes an authoring and publication platform that allows guideline content to be written and structured in a database, published directly on our web platform or exported in a computer-interpretable language (eg, XML) enabling dissemination through a wide range of outputs that include electronic medical record systems, web portals, and applications for smartphones/tablets. Modifications in guidelines, such as recommendation updates, will lead to <b>automatic</b> <b>alterations</b> in these outputs with minimal additional labor for guideline authors and publishers, greatly facilitating dynamic updating of guidelines. Semiautomated creation {{of a new generation of}} decision aids linked to guideline recommendations should facilitate face-to-face shared decision-making in the clinical encounter. We invite guideline organizations to partner with us (www. magicproject. org) to apply and further improve the tools for their purposes. This work will result in clinical practice guidelines that we cannot only trust, but also easily share and use...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) for <b>automatic</b> detection of <b>alterations</b> in the human electroencephalogram (EEG) activities during hypopnoea episodes. The obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnoea syndrome (OSAH) means ¿cessation of breath¿ during the sleep hours and the sufferers often experience related changes in the electrical activity {{of the brain and}} heart. Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction by computation of autoregressive (AR) coefficients and classification by the LS-SVMs. The EEG signals (pre and during hypopnoea) from three electrodes (C 3, C 4 and O 2) were used as input patterns of the LS-SVMs. The performance of the LS-SVMs was evaluated in terms of training performance and classification accuracies and the results confirmed that the proposed LS-SVM has potential in detecting changes in the human EEG activity due to hypopnoea episodes...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{variety and}} {{complexity}} of products in existing semiconductor factories cause an increased amount of production steps. Accordingly, {{this leads to a}} significant increase of non value added transportation processes. Therefore, transport and storage durations shall be minimized by optimal alteration of the given automated material handling system (AMHS). This can be achieved by simulation and analysis of possible AMHS alterations. However, this is a difficult task because of the system’s complexity, the large amount of data and the high effort of manually modifying and testing many different AMHS alterations. In order to assist the system experts in executing these tasks, the authors suggest a method for automatic planning, execution and comparison of simulation experiments, including the <b>automatic</b> <b>alteration</b> of the transportation system’s layout by introducing additional AMHS segments as shortcuts. The approach is feasible for existing simulation models as well as for generating simulations from the factory’s core data. ...|$|E
40|$|The Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Hypopnoea Syndrome (OSAH) means "cessation of breath" {{during the}} sleep hours and the sufferers often {{experience}} related {{changes in the}} electrical activity {{of the brain and}} heart. This paper describes the application of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model for <b>automatic</b> detection of <b>alterations</b> in the human electroencephalogram (EEG) activities during hypopnoea episodes. Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction by computation of wavelet coefficients and classification by the ANFIS trained with the backpropagation gradient descent method in combination with the least squares method. The EEG signals (pre and during hypopnoea) from three electrodes (C 3, C 4 and O 2) were used as input patterns of the three ANFIS classifiers. To improve diagnostic accuracy, the fourth ANFIS classifier (combining ANFIS) was trained using the outputs of the three ANFIS classifiers as input data. The proposed ANFIS model combined the neural network adaptive capabilities and the fuzzy logic qualitative approach. Some conclusions concerning the saliency of features on detecting any possible changes in the human EEG activity due to hypopnoea (mild case of cessation of breath) occurrences were drawn through analysis of the ANFIS. The performance of the ANFIS model was evaluated in terms of training performance and classification accuracies and the results confirmed that the proposed ANFIS model has potential in detecting changes in the human EEG activity due to hypopnoea episodes...|$|R
