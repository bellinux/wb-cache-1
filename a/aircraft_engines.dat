5|$|On {{the morning}} of 10 May 1940 the Dutch awoke {{to the sound of}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines</b> roaring in the sky. Germany had {{commenced}} operation Fall Gelb and attacked the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Luxembourg, {{in the case of the}} Low Countries without a declaration of war given before hostilities; France was already at war.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, {{the depot}} was {{responsible}} for the repair of vehicles and the conversion of aircrew coaches. <b>Aircraft</b> <b>engines,</b> propellers and radar equipment also continued to be repaired on the site, as were vehicles from the US Air Force's Third Air Force base at nearby RAF South Ruislip which began to be serviced from April 1949. The American vehicles were maintained in a dedicated shed, No. 5.|$|E
40|$|The state {{detection}} method to the <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> {{is very important}} to assure the aircraft’s safety flight, which has developed a new technology to realize the fault diagnosis to the <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine.</b> The collection of <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> vibration signal can be used to complete the <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> state detection and the fault diagnosis. In this study, the pretreated <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine’s</b> vibration signal was analyzed based on the time domain method, through the simulation, we can identify the <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine’s</b> current state from the normal flight to the fault state. And the time domain parameters can accurately judge current <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> state, which provide the research basis for the subsequent <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> fault diagnosis type...|$|R

5|$|The {{accident}} airplane, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 (registration N1819U), {{was delivered}} in 1973 {{and had been}} owned by UAL since then. Before departure on the flight from Denver on July 19, 1989, the airplane had been operated {{for a total of}} 43,401 hours and 16,997 cycles. The airplane was powered by General Electric <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Engines</b> (GEAE) CF6-6D high bypass ratio turbofan engines.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{and use of}} lithium underwent several drastic changes in history. The first major application of lithium was in high-temperature lithium greases for <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines</b> and similar applications in World War II and shortly after. This use {{was supported by the}} fact that lithium-based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps, and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps. The small demand for lithium soaps and lubricating greases was supported by several small mining operations, mostly in the US.|$|E
5|$|England {{is highly}} industrialised, {{but since the}} 1970s {{there has been a}} decline in {{traditional}} heavy and manufacturing industries, and an increasing emphasis on a more service industry oriented economy. Tourism has become a significant industry, attracting millions of visitors to England each year. The export part of the economy is dominated by pharmaceuticals, cars (although many English marques are now foreign-owned, such as Land Rover, Lotus, Jaguar and Bentley), crude oil and petroleum from the English parts of North Sea oil along with Wytch Farm, <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines</b> and alcoholic beverages.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} of the World War II era <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines,</b> the Merlin continues to be used in many restored World War II vintage aircraft all over the world. The Royal Air Force Battle of Britain Memorial Flight is a notable current operator of the Merlin. In England the Shuttleworth Collection owns and operates a Merlin-powered Hawker Sea Hurricane IB and a Supermarine Spitfire VC– the Hurricane can be seen flying at home displays throughout the summer months, while the Spitfire is currently undergoing a major restoration.|$|E
5|$|The depot {{stored and}} {{dispatched}} every item that the RAF used in wartime, from knives and forks to <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines.</b> The site was {{served by a}} large, internal railway system which left the Manchester to Crewe mainline prior to Handforth railway station. The site of the exchange sidings and junction is {{at the rear of}} the Pets At Home offices on Epsom Avenue. The depot had its own shunting locomotives, which were stored in an engine shed that stood at the Wilmslow bound exit slip road for the Handforth Dean shopping centre.|$|E
5|$|As an {{important}} industrial area, the park suffered from extensive bombing, {{particularly during the}} Manchester Blitz of December 1940. On the night of 23 December 1940, the Metropolitan-Vickers aircraft factory in Mosley Road was badly damaged, {{with the loss of}} the first 13MV-built Avro Manchester bombers in final assembly. The new Ford factory producing <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines</b> was bombed only a few days after its opening in May 1941. Trafford Hall was severely damaged by bombing, and was demolished shortly after the war ended. At the outbreak of war in 1939 there were an estimated 50,000 workers employed in the park. By {{the end of the war}} in 1945 that number had risen to 75,000, probably the peak size of the park's workforce; Metropolitan-Vickers alone employed 26,000.|$|E
50|$|The Ranger Engines Division (also Ranger <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Engine</b> Division) of the Fairchild <b>Engine</b> & <b>Aircraft</b> Corporation was an American <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> company. It {{was known}} as the Fairchild Engine Division after World War II.|$|R

5|$|German {{ground forces}} {{crossed the border}} at 05:15 on 6 April, and the Reich Minister of Propaganda, Reichsleiter Joseph Goebbels, {{announced}} the declaration of war at 06:00. Yugoslav anti-aircraft defences caused a false alarm when they reported the approach of an air raid {{from the direction of}} Romania at 03:00, but listening posts on the Romanian border had actually heard the <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines</b> of the Romanian-based Fliegerführer Arad warming up well before they took off. The VVKJ's 51st Fighter Group at Zemun had been alerted before dawn, and when reports began to be received about Luftwaffe attacks on VVKJ airfields, the first patrol was sent into the air. At first, no aircraft could be seen approaching Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines</b> of the World War II era, some fifty marks of Merlin were built by Rolls-Royce in Derby, Crewe and Glasgow, as well as by Ford of Britain at their Trafford Park factory, near Manchester. A de-rated version was also the basis of the very successful Rolls-Royce/Rover Meteor tank engine. Post-war, the Merlin was largely superseded by the Rolls-Royce Griffon for military use, with most Merlin variants being designed and built for airliners and military transport aircraft. Production ceased in 1956 with the fulfilment of an order for 170 Merlins for the Spanish Air Force's CASA 2.111 and Hispano Aviación HA-1112 aircraft, after 160,000 engines had been delivered. In addition, the Packard V-1650 was a version of the Merlin built in the United States, itself produced in numbers upwards of 55,000 examples, and was the principal engine used in the North American P-51 Mustang.|$|E
5|$|Some {{effective}} {{techniques for}} the management of ash have been developed including cleaning methods and cleaning apparatus, and actions to mitigate or limit damage. The latter include covering of openings such as: air and water intakes, <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines</b> and windows during ash fall events. Roads may be closed to allow clean-up of ash falls, or speed restrictions may be put in place, in order to prevent motorists from developing motor problems and becoming stranded following an ash fall. To prevent further effects on underground water systems or waste water networks, drains and culverts should be unblocked and ash prevented from entering the system. Ash can be moistened (but not saturated) by sprinkling with water, to prevent remobilisation of ash and to aid clean-up. Prioritisation of clean-up operations for critical facilities and coordination of clean-up efforts also constitute good management practice.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} changing firm structure in the large commercial <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> industry in the past twenty years. I identify and examine three major trends {{that have occurred in}} the <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> industry in recent years [...] -vertical disintegration in <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> design and production, use of cooperative arrangements to design and produce new engines, and a significant shift by <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> manufacturers into the provision of after-sales engine maintenance, repair and overhaul services. ^ I argue that heterogeneous capabilities in the <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> industry have encouraged firms to take steps toward vertical disintegration in engine development, design and production. I further argue that these changes have been made possible by modularity in <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> design and reductions in transaction costs achieved through advances in communication and information technologies relevant to the industry, noting that the extent of vertical disintegration is ultimately limited by product characteristics. ^ I next argue that a combination of deregulation of the airline industry and the introduction of engine choice on large commercial aircraft led to increased development costs and reductions in expected revenues for individual engine programs, prompting firms to enter into cooperative agreements to reduce both the cost and risk of new engine programs. I also argue that the establishment of joint ventures has provided additional benefits to engine manufacturers. ^ Finally, I argue that the large commercial <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 shift into after-sales services has been driven by a combination of deregulation of the airline industry, and technological advances in engine monitoring and controls. I argue that advanced engine monitoring and control technologies have shifted the balance of transaction costs in maintenance, repair and overhaul operations, and that the provision of after-sales services by engine makers under fixed-price contracts is a more efficient system. ^ This dissertation also contains a history of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> industry and detailed information regarding the large commercial <b>aircraft</b> and <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> manufacturers and their product lines. ...|$|R

5|$|By 1944, {{by which}} time Norway was {{occupied}} by Germany {{as part of the}} Second World War, overhead wire had been installed on the Flåm Line. The locomotives at Thune and nearly completed, except for the transformers, which were at Per Kure. This was during the height of resistance sabotage, and workers at Per Kure had joined the communist resistance group Osvald. Because of the Allied bombing of Germany, Per Kure was thought to become part of a decentralized production chain and would be set to assemble <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines.</b> Osvald considered the plant a legitimate target and on 30 May 1944, the factory was blown up and the transformers severely damaged. Reconstruction of them took considerable time, {{in part because of the}} general lack of materials, and in part because the head engineer for the project disappeared during late 1944. In 1945, all three locomotives were sent to Myrdal Station for storage until the transformers were finished.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-based {{superalloys}} consume {{most of the}} produced cobalt. The {{temperature stability}} of these alloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for gas turbines and jet <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines,</b> though nickel-based single crystal alloys surpass them in performance. Cobalt-based alloys are also corrosion and wear-resistant, making them (along with titanium) useful in medical orthopedic implants that do not wear down over time. The development of wear-resistant cobalt alloys started {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century with the stellite alloys, containing chromium with varying quantities of tungsten and carbon. Alloys with chromium and tungsten carbides are very hard and wear resistant. Special cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys like Vitallium are used for prosthetic parts (hip and knee replacements). Cobalt alloys are also used for dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for nickel, which may be allergenic. Some high speed steels also contain cobalt for increased heat and wear-resistance. The special alloys of aluminium, nickel, cobalt and iron, known as Alnico, and of samarium and cobalt (samarium-cobalt magnet) are used in permanent magnets. It is also alloyed with 95% platinum for jewelry, yielding an alloy suitable for fine casting and is also slightly magnetic.|$|E
5|$|McAloney was {{presented}} with his Albert Medal by the acting Governor-General of Australia, William Vanneck, 5th Baron Huntingfield, in a ceremony at Parliament House, Melbourne on 31 May 1938. McAloney recovered sufficiently from his injuries {{to return to his}} duties with the RAAF, and in September was attached to No.1 Aircraft Depot for a period of three months. During this time he was promoted to leading aircraftman, before returning to service with No.1 Squadron. He was formally transferred to No.1 Aircraft Depot from August 1939, and was advanced to corporal on 1 September that year. With the outbreak of the Second World War, McAloney received a rapid series of promotions over the following eighteen months, first to sergeant in April 1940, flight sergeant in March 1941, and finally to warrant officer in February 1942. He was primarily consigned to engine repair and engineering staff work in Australia during the conflict. After making sergeant, he became No.1 Aircraft Depot's non-commissioned officer in charge of overhaul and test work on the Rolls-Royce Kestrel engine. His duties were expanded with his March 1941 promotion to include the overhaul, inspection and testing of both the Kestrel and Rolls-Royce Merlin <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|E

5|$|On August 23, 1938, Bush was {{appointed}} to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the predecessor of NASA. Its chairman Joseph Sweetman Ames became ill, and Bush, as vice chairman, soon had to act in his place. In December 1938, NACA asked for $11 million to establish a new aeronautical research laboratory in Sunnyvale, California, to supplement the existing Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory. The California location was chosen for its proximity to some of the largest aviation corporations. This decision was supported by the chief of the United States Army Air Corps, Major General Henry H. Arnold, and by the head of the navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, Rear Admiral Arthur B. Cook, who between them were planning to spend $225 million on new aircraft in the year ahead. However, Congress was not convinced of its value, and Bush had to appear before the Senate Appropriations Committee on April 5, 1939. It was a frustrating experience for Bush, since he had never appeared before Congress before, and the senators were not swayed by his arguments. Further lobbying was required before funding for the new center, now known as the Ames Research Center, was finally approved. By this time, war had broken out in Europe, and the inferiority of American <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines</b> was apparent, in particular the Allison V-1710 which performed poorly at high altitudes and had to be removed from the P-51 Mustang in favor of the British Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. The NACA asked for funding to build a third center in Ohio, which became the Glenn Research Center. Following Ames's retirement in October 1939, Bush became chairman of the NACA, with George J. Mead as his deputy. Bush remained a member of the NACA until November 1948.|$|E
5|$|The Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to human factors limitations in the inspection and quality control procedures used by United Airlines' engine overhaul facility. These resulted in the failure to detect a fatigue crack originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the titanium-alloy stage 1 fan disk that was manufactured by General Electric <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Engines.</b> The uncontained {{manner in which the}} engine failed resulted in high-speed metal fragments being hurled from the engine; these fragments penetrated the hydraulic lines of all three independent hydraulic systems on board the aircraft, which rapidly lost their hydraulic fluid. The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10's flight controls; the flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them. Despite these losses, the crew was able to attain and then maintain limited control by using the throttles to adjust thrust to the remaining wing-mounted engines. By using each engine independently, the crew made rough steering adjustments, and by using the engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude. The crew guided the crippled jet to Sioux Gateway Airport and lined it up for landing on one of the runways. Without the use of flaps and slats, they were unable to slow down for landing, and were forced to attempt landing at a very high ground speed. The aircraft also landed at an extremely high rate of descent due to the inability to flare (reduce the rate of descent before touchdown by increasing pitch). As a result, upon touchdown the aircraft broke apart, rolled over and caught fire. The largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to the runway. Despite the ferocity of the accident, 185 (62.5%) passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including the relatively controlled manner of the crash and the early notification of emergency services.|$|E
