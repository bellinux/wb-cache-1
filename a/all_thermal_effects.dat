In this work thermal stability of DNA in solid form was thoroughly studied, mainly by optical methods. Solid samples of low molecular mass DNA were subjected to heating according to different protocols and dissolved. The temperature effect was observed in the evolution of UV absorption and circular dichroism spectra. Thin films of DNA were deposited on polished silicon wafers. They were conditioned at consecutively raised temperature and simultaneously measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry. Changes in chemical composition of thermally treated films were studied by XPS.

Within the mean-field approximation <b>all</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> are frozen out below 6 K. Nevertheless, experiments show significant changes of the critical field and the magnetization below this temperature, which reflect the presence of low-energetic dimer-spin excitations. We calculate the dimer-spin correlation functions within a self-consistent random-phase approximation, using as input the effective exchange coupling parameters obtained from the measured excitation spectra. The calculated critical field and magnetization curves exhibit the main features of those measured experimentally, but differ in important respects from the predictions of simplified boson models.

The experiment is run using a 1 DOF (degree-offreedom) parallel robot equipped with ten temperature sensors; the displacements of the end-effector are measured using an interferometer. After a session of measurements the data collected has been processed using the stepwise regression algorithm.

Methods: In this prospective pilot study, 20 patients undergoing laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis were included. Characteristic endometriotic lesions throughout the pelvis were vaporized or resected using neutral argon plasma. Specimens were evaluated for the presence of endometriosis and <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> on tissue. The bases of the treated lesions were biopsied to determine whether residual endometriosis was present. Results: Neutral argon plasma was used in 18 of the 20 patients for laparoscopic treatment of pelvic endometriosis. All biopsies confirmed complete vaporization or resection with no residual endometriosis at the base. Endometriosis was identified on pathology in <b>all</b> lesions excised. <b>Thermal</b> <b>effects</b> did not interfere with histologic analysis in any of the lesions. No complications occurred. Conclusion: Neutral argon plasma can be utilized as a multi-functional device that has vaporization, coagulation, and superficial cutting capacities with minimal thermal spread and acceptable outcomes.

40|$|The {{relaxation}} peak in Ti-Ni-based {{shape memory}} alloys is attracting much attention as high damping source, and its origin was recently {{revealed to be}} the interaction between twin boundaries and hydrogen after long controversy. However, the report on <b>thermal</b> cycling <b>effect</b> by Zhu et al., which {{is characterized by the}} peak height decrease with cycling, seems to suggest that dislocations may also affect the relaxation behavior. To understand the role of dislocations in the twin boundary-hydrogen interaction peak, changes of relaxation behavior with thermal cycling were systematically studied by dynamical mechanical analysis for both the H-containing and dehydrogenated Ti 50 Ni 50 samples. Our results show that although the origin of the relaxation peak is not related with dislocations, dislocations can affect the twin boundary-hydrogen interaction process in two opposite ways. Firstly, tangled dislocations (created by thermal cycling) make twin boundary motion difficult. On the other hand, dislocations can also absorb hydrogen from twin boundaries and make twin boundary motion easier. <b>All</b> the <b>thermal</b> cycling <b>effects</b> in dynamic tes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this contribution, a {{sequential}} and hierarchical {{approach for}} the feasibility analysis and the preliminary design of reactive distillation columns is extended to systems involving vapour phase chemical reaction and is successfully {{applied to the}} HI vapour phase decomposition to produce H 2. The complex phase and physico chemical behaviour of the quaternary HI-H 2 -I 2 -H 2 O system {{is represented by the}} Neumann's thermodynamic model and instantaneous vapour phase chemical equilibrium is assumed. Then, from minimal information concerning the physicochemical properties of the system, three successive steps lead to the design of the unit and the specification of its operating conditions: the feasibility analysis, the synthesis and the design step. First, the analysis of reactive condensation curve map method (rCCM), assuming infinite internal liquid and vapour flow rate and infinite reflux ratio, is used to assess the feasibility of the process. It determines the column structure and estimates the attainable compositions. These results are used as inputs data for the synthesis step. Based on the boundary value design method (BVD), considering finite internal liquid and vapour flow rate and finite reflux ratio while neglecting <b>all</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> and assuming a constant heat of vaporisation, the synthesis step provides more precise information about the process configuration (minimum reflux ratio, number of theoretical stages, localisation and number of reactive plates, position of the feed plate). Finally, the BVD method results are used to initialise rigorous simulations, based on an equilibrium stage model with energy balance, to estimate the reflux ratio taking into account thermal effect on the process. The resulting design configuration consists in a single feed and entirely reactive distillation column. The column operates under a pressure of 22 bars. The feed of the reactive distillation column, coming from the Bunsen reaction section [xHI= 0. 10; xI 2 = 0. 39 xH 2 O= 0. 51], is at its boiling temperature. The residue consists in pure iodine. Water and produced hydrogen are recovered at the distillate. The column operates at a reflux ratio of 5 and is composed of 11 theoretical plates including the reboiler and the partial condenser with the feed at the stage 10 (counted downwards). The obtained HI dissociation yield is 99. 6 %...|$|E
40|$|Recently, a new non-Standard Model {{neutrino}} {{interaction mediated}} by a light scalar field was proposed, which renders the big-bang relic neutrinos {{of the cosmic}} neutrino background a natural dark energy candidate, the so-called Neutrino Dark Energy. As a further consequence of this interaction, the neutrino masses become functions of the neutrino energy densities and are thus promoted to dynamical, time/redshift dependent quantities. Such a possible neutrino mass variation introduces a redshift dependence into the resonance energies associated with the annihilation of extremely high-energy cosmic neutrinos on relic anti-neutrinos and vice versa into Z-bosons. In general, this annihilation process is expected to lead to sizeable absorption dips in the spectra to be observed on earth by neutrino observatories operating in the relevant energy region above 10 ^ 13 GeV. In our analysis, we contrast the characteristic absorption features produced by constant and varying neutrino masses, including <b>all</b> <b>thermal</b> background <b>effects</b> caused by the relic neutrino motion. We firstly consider neutrinos from astrophysical sources and secondly neutrinos originating from the decomposition of topological defects using the appropriate fragmentation functions. On the one hand, independent {{of the nature of}} neutrino masses, our results illustrate the discovery potential for the cosmic neutrino background by means of relic neutrino absorption spectroscopy. On the other hand, they allow to estimate the prospects for testing its possible interpretation as source of Neutrino Dark Energy within the next decade by the neutrino observatories ANITA and LOFAR.

In this study, we report the geochemistry and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic compositions of the igneous rocks, and evaluate the <b>thermal</b> <b>effect</b> induced by this large-scale igneous intrusion on the host rocks. The analyzed igneous samples exhibit strong enrichment in light rare earth elements (LREE) and large-ion lithophile elements (LILE), having characteristics similar to intra-plate oceanic island basalts (OIB). The Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic data display narrow ranges (e. g. Sr/Sr = 0. 7042 – 0. 7044, Nd/Nd = 0. 5128 – 0. 5129, Pb/Pb = 18. 90 – 18. 94, εHf(t) = + 7. 56 ∼+ 9. 60). Geochemical and isotopic compositions suggest a mixed mantle source between depleted mid-ocean-ridge-basalt (MORB) mantle (DMM) -like mantle and enriched mantle type II (EMII, possibly the Hainan mantle plume). Vitrinite reflectance values, major mineralogical changes together with a maturity-related biomarker [Ts/(Ts + Tm) ] <b>all</b> reveal significant <b>thermal</b> <b>effect</b> induced by the igneous intrusion.

Moreover, our {{results suggest that the}} host rocks above the igneous intrusion are characterised by higher maturity than below, which should be attributed to the different behavior of hydrothermal fluids. These observations suggest that the <b>thermal</b> <b>effect</b> of large-scale thick igneous intrusions is much more intense than that of thin igneous intrusions, and the behavior of hydrothermal fluids induced by magmatic intrusive events should be a critical impact factor during heat transfer process...|$|R

40|$|The thermomass theory regards heat owning mass-energy duality, exhibiting energy-like {{features}} in conversion and mass-like {{features in}} transfer processes. The equivalent mass of thermal energy {{is determined by}} the mass-energy equivalence of Einstein, which therefore leads to the inertia of heat in transfer. In this work, we build up a thermomass gas model based on this theory to describe the fluid-flow-like heat conduction process in a medium. The equation of state and the governing equations for transport for the thermomass gas have been derived based on methodologies of the classical mechanics since the drift speed of thermomass gas is generally far lower than the speed of light. We therefore present the general heat conduction law to describe the relationship between the heat flux and the temperature fields. The general law provides us a new viewpoint to understand the previous laws for heat conduction, such as the Fourier’s law and the CV (Cattaneo-Vernotte) model. The general law will degenerate to the Fourier’s law when <b>all</b> the <b>thermal</b> inertial <b>effects</b> are negligible or to the CV model for the unsteady heat conduction when the space-dependent inertial effects are negligible.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the structure of}} neutron stars shortly after they are born, when the entropy per baryon is of order 1 or 2 and neutrinos are trapped on dynamical timescales. We find that the structure depends more sensitively on {{the composition of the}} star than on its entropy, and that the number of trapped neutrinos {{play an important role in}} determining the composition. Since the structure is chiefly determined by the pressure of the strongly interacting constituents and the nature of the strong interactions is poorly understood at high density, we consider several models of dense matter, including matter with strangenessrich hyperons, a kaon condensate and quark matter. In <b>all</b> cases, the <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> for an entropy per baryon of order 2 or less are small when considering the maximum neutron star mass. Neutrino trapping, however, significantly changes the maximum mass due to the abundance of electrons. When matter is allowed to contain only nucleons and leptons, trapping decreases the maximum mass by an amount comparable to, but somewhat larger than, the increase due to finite entropy. When matter is allowed to contain strongly interacting negatively charged particles, in the form of strange baryons, a kaon condensate, or quarks, trapping instead results in an increas...|$|R
