If the target radiated noise level is high enough, it can have a greater range than active sonar, and allows the target to be identified. Since any motorized object makes some noise, it may in principle be detected, depending {{on the level of}} noise emitted and the ambient noise level in the area, as well as the technology used. To simplify, passive sonar [...] "sees" [...] around the ship using it. On a submarine, nose-mounted passive sonar detects in directions of about 270°, centered on the ship's alignment, the hull-mounted array of about 160° on each side, and the towed array of a full 360°. The invisible areas are due to the ship's own interference. Once a signal is detected in a certain direction (which means that something makes sound in that direction, this is called broadband detection) it is possible to zoom in and analyze the signal received (narrowband analysis). This is generally done using a Fourier transform to show the different frequencies making up the sound. Since every engine makes a specific sound, it is straightforward to identify the object. Databases of unique engine sounds are part of what is known as acoustic intelligence or <b>ACINT.</b>|$|E

A field command of Commander Naval Intelligence Command that reported operationally to the Commander U.S. SIXTH Fleet, CTG 168.3/EURFAST was responsible for intelligence collection and direct support operations for SIXTH Fleet ships, submarines, and squadrons operating in the Mediterranean, including the deployment on ships and submarines of command Intelligence Specialists and Sonar Technicians (Acoustic Intelligence Specialists). In addition to these direct support operations, CTG 168.3/EURFAST operated an Acoustic Intelligence (<b>ACINT)</b> Analysis laboratory and supervised numerous bilateral intelligence agreements with allied European Navies. During this period of time, CDR Wilson was “dual-hatted” as Commander Task Unit 168.4.2, a Human Intelligence (HUMINT) organization supporting operational and administrative U.S. Navy commands in Southern Europe.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the extensional axiom of choice (ACext) implies the law of {{excluded}} middle (EM). We here prove that the converse holds as well if we have the intensional (‘type-theoretical’) axiom of choice <b>ACint,</b> which is provable in Martin-Löf’s type theory, and a weak extensionality principle (Ext−), which is provable in Martin-Löf’s extensional type theory. In particular, EM ⇔ ACext holds in extensional type theory. The following is the principle <b>ACint</b> of intensional choice: if A, B are sets and R a relation such that (∀x: A) (∃y: B) R(x, y) is true, then there is a function f: A → B such that (∀x: A) R(x, f(x)) is true. It is provable in Martin-Löf’s type theory [8, p. 50]. It follows from <b>ACint</b> that surjective functions have right inverses: If =B is an equivalence relation on B and f: A → B, we say that f is surjective if (∀y: B) (∃x: A) (y =B f(x)) is true. With R(y, x) def = (y =B f(x)), surjectivit...|$|E
40|$|In {{photosynthetic}} {{tissues of}} the CAM plant pineapple (Ananas comosus), storage of soluble sugars {{in the central}} vacuole during the daytime and their remobilization at night is required to provide carbon skeletons for nocturnal CO(2) fixation. However, soluble sugars produced photosynthetically must also be exported to support growth processes in heterotrophic tissues. To begin to address how vacuolar sugar storage and assimilate partitioning are regulated in A. comosus, degenerate PCR and cDNA library screening were used to clone three candidate sugar transporters from the leaves of this species. Subcellular localization of the three transporters was investigated via expression of YFP-fusion proteins in tobacco epidermal cells and their co-localization with subcellular markers by confocal microscopy. Using this strategy, a putative hexose transporter (AcMST 1) and a putative inositol transporter (<b>AcINT</b> 1) were identified that both localized to the tonoplast, whereas a putative sucrose transporter (AcSUT 1) was found to localize to prevacuolar compartments. A cDNA (AcMST 2) with high similarity to a recently characterized tonoplast hexose transporter in Arabidopsis was also identified from an A. comosus fruit EST database. Analyses of transcript abundance indicated that AcMST 1 was more highly expressed in fruits compared to leaves of A. comosus, whilst transcripts of <b>AcINT</b> 1, AcSUT 1, and AcMST 2 were more abundant in leaves. Transcript abundance of <b>AcINT</b> 1, the putative inositol transporter, showed day-night changes {{comparable to those of}} other CAM-related transcripts described in Mesembryanthemum crystallinum. The results are discussed in terms of the role of vacuolar sugar transporters in regulating carbon flow during the diel cycle in CAM plants...|$|E
40|$|A new {{architecture}} for fusing {{information and}} data from heterogeneous sources is proposed. The approach takes criminalistics as a model. In analogy {{to the work}} of detectives, who attempt to investigate crimes, software agents are initiated that pursue clues and try to consolidate or to dismiss hypotheses. Like their human pendants, they can, if questions beyond their competences arise, consult expert agents. Within the context of a certain task, region, and time interval, specialized operations are applied to each relevant information source, e. g. IMINT, SIGINT, <b>ACINT,</b> [...] ., HUMINT, data bases etc. in order to establish hit lists of first clues. Each clue is described by its pertaining facts, uncertainties, and dependencies in form of a local degree-of-belief (DoB) distribution in a Bayesian sense. For each clue an agent is initiated which cooperates with other agents and experts. Expert agents support to make use of different information sources. Consultations of experts, capable to access certain information sources, result in changes of the DoB of the pertaining clue. According to the significance of concentration of their DoB distribution clues are abandoned or pursued further to formulate task specific hypotheses. Communications between the agents serve to find out whether different clues belong to the same cause and thus can be put together. At the end of the investigation process, the different hypotheses are evaluated by a jury and a final report is created that constitutes the fusion result. The approach proposed avoids calculating global DoB distributions by adopting a local Bayesian approximation and thus reduces the complexity of the exact problem essentially. Different information sources are transformed into DoB distributions using the maximum entropy paradigm and considering known facts as constraints. Nominal, ordinal and cardinal quantities can be treated within this framework equally. The architecture is scalable by tailoring the number of agents according to the available computer resources, to the priority of tasks, and to the maximum duration of the fusion process. Furthermore, the architecture allows cooperative work of human and automated agents and experts, as long as not all subtasks can be accomplished automatically...|$|E
