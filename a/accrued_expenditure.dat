50|$|The {{standard}} {{benefit is}} not the most common benefit mix offered by Part D plans. Only 11% of PDPs in 2010 offered the defined standard benefit described above. Plans vary widely in their formularies and cost-sharing requirements. Most eliminate the deductible and use tiered drug co-payments rather than coinsurance. The only out-of-pocket costs that count toward getting out of the coverage gap and into catastrophic coverage are True Out-Of-Pocket (TrOOP) <b>expenditures.</b> TrOOP <b>expenditures</b> <b>accrue</b> only when drugs on plan's formulary are purchased in accordance with the restrictions on those drugs. Monthly premium payments do not count towards TrOOP.|$|R

50|$|The {{revenues}} amassed from tourism {{typically do}} not benefit {{the host country}} or the local communities. Income to local communities generated by tourism are all of the <b>expenditures</b> <b>accrued</b> after taxes, profits, and wages are paid out; however, around 80% of traveler's expenditures go to airlines, hotels, and international companies, not to local businesses. These funds {{are referred to as}} leakages. Tourism has also been blamed for other negative economic impacts to local communities. Although resort towns usually boast more improved infrastructure than surrounding areas, these developments usually present high costs to local governments and tax payers. Reallocating government funds to subsidize infrastructure and tax breaks to firms shift available funding to local education and health services. In addition, resort towns typically do not have dynamic economies, resulting in an over dependence on one industry. Economic dependence on tourism poses particular challenges to resort towns and its local residents given the seasonal nature of the job market in some areas. Local residents of resort towns face job insecurity, difficulties in obtaining training, medical-benefits, and housing.|$|R
40|$|The {{reliability}} of EMU’s fiscal indicators {{has been questioned}} by recent episodes of large upward deficit revisions. This paper discusses the causes of such revisions {{in order to identify}} ways to improve monitoring. The computation of EMU’s deficit indicator involves the assessment of <b>accrued</b> revenue and <b>expenditure</b> and the identification of transactions in financial assets. Both can open margins for opportunistic accounting. However, crosschecks between deficit and changes in gross nominal debt (the other fiscal indicator used in EMU) can reduce the scope for fiscal gimmickry. Simple comparison of deficit and changes in debt can readily spotlight large inconsistencies in fiscal data. Nevertheless, consistency checks must go deeper than simple comparison, since different items in the reconciliation account between deficit and change in debt can offset each other. Econometric evidence suggests that such offset may indeed have been used to reduce the visibility of deficit-specific fiscal gimmickry. Attention to the quality of statistics has increased in recent years, also {{in the context of the}} reform of the Stability and Growth Pact. In this context, the paper argues that detailed analysis of the reconciliation account between deficit and change in debt is crucial to the effectiveness of monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Wind power {{constituted}} {{more than}} 35 % of new U. S. electric generating capacity in 2007. Common drivers of wind power include Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), the federal production tax credit (PTC), and rural economic development benefits. Continued {{expansion of the}} wind industry into Nebraska would bring new employment and economic development to Nebraska and the country. This report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) focuses on the economic development impacts {{that would result in}} Nebraska from development and operation of wind power in the state as envisioned in the U. S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) report 20 % Wind Energy by 2030. Under the national 20 % wind scenario, 7, 800 megawatts (MW) of new wind power is added in Nebraska. A practical first step to building 7, 800 MW of wind is completing 1, 000 MW. We also include the estimated economic impacts to Nebraska from building 1, 000 MW of wind power. Economic impacts are estimated with NREL’s Jobs and Economic Development (JEDI) Wind model and include direct, indirect, and induced impacts. Direct impacts <b>accrue</b> from <b>expenditures</b> in the wind industry. Indirect impacts accrue in supporting industries as a result of increased demand for basic goods and services. Induced impacts result from reinvestment and spending by direct and indirect beneficiaries. In some cases, depending on the structure of the local economy, indirect and induced impacts may be greater than direct wind industry impacts. Jobs values are defined as construction-period jobs, operations-period jobs, and average employment impacts. All jobs totals include direct, indirect, and induced jobs. Construction-period jobs are defined as short-term, 1 -year jobs, and include those jobs resulting from Nebraska-based construction and manufacturing. Operations-period jobs are full-time jobs that exist for the operating lifetime of the wind power facility; typically this is 20 years. Average employment is defined as the average jobs — direct, indirect, and induced — supported by wind development and operations over the full construction and operations period. This period is defined as 40 years for the 7, 800 MW built in accord with the national 20 % wind scenario and 22 years for the 1, 000 -MW analysis. All results are expressed as ranges and are based on the four possible development scenarios foreseen for Nebraska. Primary variables contributing to the range of impacts are the role of Nebraska manufacturing, the prevalence of Nebraska project ownership, and the availability and utilization of Nebraska labor...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{growth in}} the {{utilisation}} of Electronic Gaming Machines (EGMs) has led to community disquiet about attendant problems of alleged loss of community standards, problem gambling and losses by retailers and other local businesses. Recent legislation {{provides an opportunity for}} local councils to object to any proposals to increase numbers of EGMs on the grounds of social and economic impact on the local community. The Pokie Application Research Kit (PARK) is a software tool that aims to help local councils determine the local social and economic impact of the introduction of additional EGMs to venues within their boundaries. PARK evaluates the benefit of additional EGMs by tracing the way in which expenditures on EGMs feed, or do not feed, into the local economy. If expenditures do feed through to further local economic activity there is a benefit for the local economy. If the <b>expenditures</b> <b>accrue</b> to agents who repatriate them outside the local economy there is no benefit for it. In such a circumstance the expenditure is said to be 'leaked'. The PARK model compares the situation that would arise with additional expenditures on EGMs with the status quo. In operationalising the comparison a number of crucial assumptions are required, the most important concerning 'leaked' expenditures. The analysis finds the results are very sensitive to these assumptions and the current structure of the model predisposes it to show large net losses from the introduction of additional EGMs. Alternative approaches to measuring the local economic impact of increasing the number of EGMs and the role of local economic impacts in the broader public policy debate are discussed in the paper. ...|$|R
40|$|Corporations have {{invested}} {{billions of dollars}} in information technology (IT) over the last 20 years. There is much debate regarding the benefits <b>accruing</b> from these <b>expenditures.</b> Direct linkage between technology investment and increases in organizational performance and productivity has been extremely elusive. This research investigates the relationship between IT investment and organizational performance so that managers may better evaluate IT expenditures. With data on IT investment and organizational performance from 350 public companies over 4 years, this study uses structural equation analysis to empirically test a theoretical model composed of five IT investment variables and five organizational performance variables. The study found that the variable used to measure the extent to which users have access to IT was significantly and positively related to sales by employee, an organizational measure of labor productivity. Two other IT investment variables, the value of supercomputers, mainframes, and minicomputers and the percentage of IT budget spent on IT staff, were significantly and negatively associated with the sales by employee measure. Another IT variable, the IT budget as a percentage of revenue, was significantly and negatively associated with sales by total assets, a traditional measure of capital productivity. The last IT variable, the percentage of IT budget spent on IT staff training, was not related to any performance variable. Implications of these findings are discussed and, from a management perspective, postulations relating IT investment to organizational performance are stated. Researchers are provided with suggestions and encouraged to use these results to probe deeper into the relationship between IT investment and organizational performance. information technology investments investment-performance analysis organizational strategic and economic performance...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{unemployment}} is eventually becoming {{a problem in}} Austria as economic restructuring {{in the wake of}} increasing competition is taking its toll. During 1994 as the general unemployment rate amounted to 6. 5 percent, 31. 5 percent of all unemployed had been on the dole for more than 6 months. As recourse to disability pensions and early retirement is increasingly being questioned as viable solution for the reduction in unemployment of older workers, the mounting employment problems of older workers become visible. As unemployment rises in occupations and economic sectors such as leather, clothing and textile industries as well as chemical, metal and electrical industries which are exposed severe international competitive pressure, older workers have great difficulties changing their profession. Regional mobility of the unemployed is already low and even more so in the case of older workers. In such an environment of high and rising unemployment socio-economically handicapped persons stand no chance of reintegration into the labor market unless specific employment creation measures are undertaken. An evaluation study of employment projects for marginalized long-term unemployed showed that active labor market policies of this sort were the most cost-effective measures of reintegrating socio-economically handicapped persons into the labor market in Austria. As the cost for passive labor market measures rises, {{as the result of the}} rapid increase in unemployment and of the prolongation of maternity leave, active labor market measures are losing out. Since 1987 when Sch 4, 000 million were spent on active labor market policy measures, or 15. 7 percent of the total expenditures on labor market policies, no further increase in nominal expenditures took place. In 1994 only Sch 4, 963 million or 9. 5 percent of total <b>expenditures</b> <b>accrued</b> to active labor market policies. Measures specifically geared to help the long-term unemployed have not been given high priority; the lack of funding makes social and labor market exclusion a veritable threat for marginalized groups in the labor market.

40|$|Sooyoung Shin Ajou University College of Pharmacy, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea Background: Stress ulcers {{and related}} upper {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding are well-known complications {{in intensive care}} unit (ICU) patients. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) -based stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) has been widely prescribed in noncritically ill patients who are at low risk for clinically significant bleeding, which is then injudiciously continued after hospital discharge. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of inappropriate prescribing of PPI-based preventative therapy in ICU versus non-ICU patients that subsequently continued postdischarge, and to estimate the costs incurred by the unwarranted outpatient continuation of PPI therapy. Methods: A retrospective review of patient data at a major teaching hospital in Korea was performed. During the 4 -year study period, adult patients who were newly initiated on PPI-based SUP during hospital admission and subsequently discharged on a PPI without a medical indication for such therapy were captured for data analysis. The incidence rates of inappropriate prescribing of PPIs were compared between ICU and non-ICU patients, and the costs associated with such therapy were also examined. Results: A total of 4, 410 patients, {{more than half of the}} inpatient-initiated PPI users, were deemed to have been inadvertently prescribed a PPI at discharge in the absence of a medical need for acid suppression. The incidence of inappropriate outpatient continuation of the prophylaxis was higher among ICU patients compared with non-ICU patients (57. 7 % versus 52. 2 %, respectively; P= 0. 001). The total <b>expenditure</b> <b>accrued</b> through the continuation of nonindicated PPI therapy was approximately US$ 40, 175. Conclusion: This study confirmed that excess usage of PPIs for SUP has spread to low-risk, non-ICU patients. The overuse of unwarranted PPI therapy can incur large health care expenditure, as well as clinical complications with minimal therapeutic benefits. Educating clinicians regarding SUP guidelines and the adverse effects of long-term use of acid suppression can improve the cost effectiveness of PPI therapy.
