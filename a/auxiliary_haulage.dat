40|$|Due to {{operational}} {{advantage of}} dragline in simultaneous excavation and back-filling, the equipment has gained vast importance in open-pit mining. Besides, absence of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>haulage</b> units and {{a myriad of}} other benefits are also credited in favor of excavation of muck piles by the draglines. However, the aspects of production, productivity and economics are of utmost significance in dragline operation and planning. In this light, the present paper is an endeavor to analyze availability and utilization of dragline operations. The paper presents {{a good amount of}} data for 4 -draglines operating in one of the major opencast projects in India. The study reveals the trends of availability and utilization of these draglines during last 11 -years. Furthermore, the study also highlights the salient reasons for loss of available hours and for idling of the draglines. Some startling information and facts have been illustrated in form of graphs and pie charts...|$|E

In {{view of the}} {{problems}} existing in the present transportation ways of coal mine, a kind of new <b>auxiliary</b> <b>haulage</b> system has been designed, which can achieve the going there and back transportation only by using one winch in the multi-slope and undulating roadway. And {{according to the requirements}} of safety production of coal mine, the non-wheeled supply mine car without anti-car device and the safety interlock system of wheeled supply mine car have been designed. Meanwhile, finite element analysis software is adopted to check and analyze the locking pawl strength of the safety interlock system with wheeled supply mine car. The analyzing result shows that the locking pawl can completely stand the impact loading when the mine car sliding down. The haulage costs and the occurrence of security incidents have been reduced when the designed system is applied to coal mine. Engineering practice shows that the good results have been achieved...|$|E
