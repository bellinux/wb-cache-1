50|$|In the show, Airwolf was an armored, {{stealthy}} aircraft. It {{could perform}} impossible maneuvers and stunts, including traveling at mach speeds (the theoretical maximum {{speed of a}} helicopter is significantly below Mach 0.5, or half the speed of sound), flying upside down, and flying into the stratosphere. Some of these impossible capabilities are explained in the show by such features as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> (visible at {{the roots of the}} landing gear sponsons), rotor blades that can be disengaged for supersonic flight and a lifting body fuselage.|$|R

This report deals with the behavior of the jet in close proximity to a two-dimensional surface. The experiments were made to find out whether the axially symmetric stream tends to approach the flat surface.

40|$|A wind-tunnel {{model test}} at advance ratios from 0 to 0. 3 {{with and without}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> thrust is reported. At each advance ratio and engine thrust, both the control power and the {{aircraft}} stability were measured. The results indicate {{that there is a}} cross-coupling for collective pitch and longitudinal cyclic pitch inputs. The control power for these inputs increased with advance ratio. There was also cross-coupling for differential collective pitch inputs. The airframe was longitudinally unstable, but the instability was less at the highest advance ratio tested. The airframe showed both positive effective dihedral and positive directional stability...|$|R

40|$|In {{accordance}} with a {{request of the}} Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Department, tests were performed in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel to determine the spin and recovery characteristics of a 1 / 24 scale model of the Grumman XTB 3 F- 1 airplane. The airplane is a two-place, midwing torpedo bomber equipped with a tractor propeller and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engine.</b> The effect of control setting and movement on the erect and inverted spin and recovery characteristics of the model were determined for the normal loading. Brief tests with mass extended slightly along the fuselage were also made, however, {{in order to determine}} the effect of such a mass variation on elevator effectiveness. Tests were performed to determine the size of emergency spin-recovery tail and wing-tip parachutes required for satisfactory recovery by parachute action alone. The investigation also included emergency pilot-escape tests and tests to determine the rudder pedal and elevator stick forces necessary to move the rudder and elevator for recovery...|$|R
50|$|<b>Auxiliary</b> rockets and/or <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> {{can help}} a fully loaded {{aircraft}} to take off within {{the length of the}} runway. The rockets are usually one-time units that are jettisoned after takeoff. This practice was common in the 1950s and 60s, when the lower levels of thrust from military turbojets was inadequate for takeoff from shorter runways or with very heavy payloads. It is now seldom used.|$|R

40|$|In {{preparation}} for upcoming wind tunnel acoustic experiments of a Hybrid Wing Body (HWB) vehicle with two <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> simulator <b>units,</b> {{a series of}} twin jet aeroacoustic investigations were conducted leading to increased understanding and risk mitigation. A previously existing twin jet nozzle system and a fabricated HWB aft deck fuselage are combined for a 1. 9 % model scale study of jet nozzle spacing and jet cant angle effects, elevon deflection into the jet plume, and acoustic shielding by the fuselage body. Linear and phased array microphone measurements are made, and data processing includes the use of DAMAS (Deconvolution Approach for the Mapping of Acoustic Sources). Closely-spaced twin jets with a 5 inward cant angle exhibit reduced noise levels compared to their parallel flow counterparts at similar and larger nozzle spacings. A 40 elevon deflection into the twin jet plume, which is required for HWB ground rotation, can significantly increase upstream noise levels (more than 5 dB OASPL) with only minimal increases in the downstream direction. Lastly, DAMAS processing can successfully measure the noise source distribution of multiple shielded jet sources...|$|R
50|$|A Lift jet is a {{lightweight}} <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> {{used to provide}} vertical thrust for VTOL operation, and is then shut down in forward flight. Some VTOL designs have used both vectored thrust from the main engine together with <b>auxiliary</b> lift <b>jets.</b>|$|R
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the jet age, when the potential of reactive engines was recognised, several histories of the <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> were written. A once-classified Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory and Jet Propulsion Laboratory study completed in 1946 described the Coandă-1910 as [...] "probably not flown" [...] but featuring [...] "a mechanical jet propulsion device with a centrifugal blower", one in which heat from the Clerget piston <b>engine</b> [...] "furnished <b>auxiliary</b> <b>jet</b> propulsion." [...] In the editorial lead to their 1946 article on Coandă's [...] "Augmented Flow", Flight terms it, [...] "scarcely a jet". In the same year Geoffrey G. Smith chronicled technological development in his book Gas Turbines and Jet Propulsion for Aircraft, but did not mention Coandă.|$|R
40|$|The design {{requirements}} for two new Compact <b>Jet</b> <b>Engine</b> Simulator (CJES) <b>units</b> for upcoming wind tunnel testing {{lead to the}} distinct possibility of rig noise contamination. The acoustic and aerodynamic properties of several flow conditioner devices are investigated over a range of operating conditions relevant to the CJES units to mitigate the risk of rig noise. An impinging jet broadband noise source {{is placed in the}} upstream plenum of the test facility permitting measurements of not only flow conditioner self-noise, but also noise attenuation characteristics. Several perforated plate and honeycomb samples of high porosity show minimal self-noise but also minimal attenuation capability. Conversely, low porosity perforated plate and sintered wire mesh conditioners exhibit noticeable attenuation but also unacceptable self-noise. One fine wire mesh sample (DP 450661) shows minimal selfnoise and reasonable attenuation, particularly when combined in series with a 15. 6 percent open area (POA) perforated plate upstream. This configuration is the preferred flow conditioner system for the CJES, providing up to 20 dB of broadband attenuation capability with minimal self-noise...|$|R
50|$|A <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> is a {{reaction}} engine discharging a fast-moving jet that generates thrust by jet propulsion.

5000|$|Sikorsky {{developed}} the X2 helicopter on a $50 million budget. The design includes expertise gathered from several earlier design projects. The S-69/XH-59A Advancing Blade Concept Demonstrator {{had shown that}} high speed was possible with a coaxial helicopter with <b>auxiliary</b> propulsion (two <b>jet</b> <b>engines),</b> but that vibration and fuel consumption was excessive; the Cypher UAV expanded the company's knowledge of the unique aspects of coaxial flight control laws with a fly-by-wire aircraft; and the RAH-66 Comanche developed expertise in composite rotors and advanced transmission design. Other features include slowed [...] "de-swirling" [...] rigid rotors two feet apart, active force counter-vibration inspired by the Black Hawk, and using most of the power in forward flight for the pusher propeller rather than the rotor. Test flights and flight simulations were combined to improve test procedure. The fly-by-wire system is provided by Honeywell, the rotor by Eagle Aviation Technologies, anti-vibration technology from Moog Inc, and propeller by Aero Composites. The rotor hub can have 10-20 times the drag of the blade. Sikorsky intended to test hub fairings to reduce drag by 40%, and test flew fairings on the hubs themselves but not the central hub fairing ("aero sail") in between the hubs. Sikorsky has since patented a [...] "Standpipe" [...] (fixed tube between rotating rotor axes) suitable for a central hub fairing.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{scattered}} {{radar signal}} by a <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> inlet involves engine information of the target. The <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> RCS {{due to the}} engine inlet is therefore significant in radar target recognition. Accordingly, several accurate analyses of the <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> RCS have been reported. Reduction of the <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> RCS is also required for stealth technology. We suggest a new approach for <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> RCS reduction that involves the insertion of many small corrugations into the <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> inlet. The proposed <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> structure {{is assumed to be}} a circular waveguide cavity with many corrugations. The structure is analyzed by combining a mode matching technique with a scattering matrix analysis. The proposed closed-form RCS solutions of the corrugated engine structure are validated with a MoM simulation using FEKO. The proposed closed-form solution has numerical efficiency and rapid convergence. Using the characteristics of the solution, we simply apply a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the structure of the corrugations in terms of minimizing the RCS. 1...|$|R

50|$|An airbreathing <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> (or ducted <b>jet</b> <b>engine)</b> is a <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> {{propelled}} by a jet of hot exhaust gases formed from heated and expanded air that is {{drawn into the}} engine via a compressor, typically a centrifugal or axial type.

40|$|One {{approach}} toward achieving NASA's aggressive N+ 2 noise goal of 42 EPNdB cumulative margin below Stage 4 {{is through the}} use of novel vehicle configurations like the Hybrid Wing Body (HWB). Jet noise measurements from an HWB acoustic test in NASA Langley's 14 - by 22 -Foot Subsonic Tunnel are described. Two dual-stream, heated Compact <b>Jet</b> <b>Engine</b> Simulator (CJES) <b>units</b> are mounted underneath the inverted HWB model on a traversable support to permit measurement of varying levels of shielding provided by the fuselage. Both an axisymmetric and low noise chevron nozzle set are investigated in the context of shielding. The unshielded chevron nozzle set shows 1 to 2 dB of source noise reduction (relative to the unshielded axisymmetric nozzle set) with some penalties at higher frequencies. Shielding of the axisymmetric nozzles shows up to 6. 5 dB of reduction at high frequency. The combination of shielding and low noise chevrons shows benefits beyond the expected additive benefits of the two, up to 10 dB, due to the effective migration of the jet source peak noise location upstream for increased shielding effectiveness. Jet noise source maps from phased array results processed with the Deconvolution Approach for the Mapping of Acoustic Sources (DAMAS) algorithm reinforce these observations...|$|R
