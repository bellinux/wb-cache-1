5|$|Permanent {{habitation}} on {{the islands}} possibly extends back at least two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180 (<b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> more than 100 after 1851). The entire remaining population was evacuated from Hirta (the only inhabited island) in 1930. The islands house a unique form of stone structure known as cleitean, which are only found here. A cleit is a stone storage hut or bothy; whilst many are still to be found, they are slowly falling into disrepair. There {{are known to be}} 1,260 cleitean on Hirta and a further 170 on the other group islands. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months.|$|E

Boys {{was the first}} person to whom Napoleon spoke upon his arrival in St Helena, {{although}} this is disputed by other contemporary accounts which report that the arrival occurred in silence with no exchanges between Napoleon and the waiting crowd <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> explicit mention of Rev.

500|$|Dresser's biographer, Clayton Henderson, {{attributed}} {{the success of}} the song to the [...] "perfect marriage of words and music." [...] An Indiana newspaper compared the song in popularity to [...] "Swanee River" [...] and wrote, [...] "Mr. Dresser... has endeavored to perpetuate the beauties of the Wabash as did Stephen Foster that of the Suwannee River, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> song since the latter has awakened so much interest among lovers of a good song, nor has any other American author seemed as capable of filling the void left vacant by Foster. The song is a gem and a welcome relief from some of the so-called popular songs sprung on the public from time to time." ...|$|E
500|$|The manga's {{critical}} reaction has been mixed. Most critics reached a consensus regarding {{the high quality}} of its art, describing it as [...] "crisp", [...] "solid", and [...] "clean and well done". Other aspects of the series have divided critics' opinions. Manga Life's Michael Aronson praised the enemy designs, while Carlo Santos of Anime News Network (ANN) criticized them, adding the series [...] "is not much fun to read, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> fun to look at". Writing for Active Anime, Sandra Scholes found points {{of interest in the}} series' story, and praised its action. Santos said the action [...] "got all the drive and excitement of shōnen action", and [...] Comic Book Bin's Leroy Douresseaux called the series [...] "a mixture of Dragonball Z and Naruto, but filled with even more weirdness".|$|E
500|$|When {{his father}} died in 1629, Temple was the main {{beneficiary}} of his father's estate. However, much of his father’s property was held via his wife, mortgaged or being used to meet other commitments. Temple had a relatively meagre inheritance - no grand country house, no great estate <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> large fortune. His financial affairs were not in good order and were discussed by {{other members of the}} family. Margaret Longville, Temple’s cousin, wrote to her mother, [...] "my cousin Carew Saunders is broke for forty thousand pounds and is not able to pay five shillings in the pound and James Temple is in too much". During Charles I's Personal Rule (1629–1640), he was part of a network of Puritan gentry in Sussex and in due course became a Sussex Justice of the Peace (JP).|$|E

500|$|When play resumed, England's Gubby Allen bowled {{an entire}} over to Bradman. As Larwood {{prepared}} to bowl his next over to Woodfull, Jardine changed to the Bodyline field setting. The capacity Saturday afternoon crowd viewed this as hitting a {{man when he}} was down. Journalist-cricketer Dick Whitington, wrote that Jardine's actions were seen as [...] "an unforgivable crime in Australian eyes <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> part of cricket". Mass hooting and jeering occurred after almost every ball. Whitington noted that [...] " [...] Hele believes that had what followed occurred in Melbourne the crowd would have leapt the fence and belaboured the English captain; Larwood, and possibly the entire side". Some English players later expressed fears that a large-scale riot and that the police {{would not be able}} to stop the irate home crowd, who were worried that Woodfull or Bradman could be killed, from attacking them. When Larwood immigrated to Australia two decades later, he remained fearful for his safety.|$|E
500|$|Poniewozik {{notes that}} [...] "It also remains {{a delight to}} watch Spacey pump the humid breath of life into House of Cards’ arid Capitol chill. If only his {{character}} weren’t so dominant of his surroundings as well. One reason the series’ movements can feel so mechanical is that, so far, no one seems nearly in Underwood’s league: not the adversaries he battles directly, nor the sad sacks that he gulls without their even knowing it." [...] Chuck Barney of the San Jose Mercury News notes that the preview episodes show that [...] "Frank's [...] "Survivor"-like back-stabbing is beginning to feel a bit repetitive." [...] and that his lack of an adversarial foil has become an issue: [...] "...things always seem to fall neatly into place for him. Even his showdowns with the president (Michel Gill) come off as one-sided..." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday notes that [...] "Frank Underwood has no remorse, no superannuated sense of Washington tradition or decorum, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> second thoughts. He is TV's perfect monster of the moment - a compleat malefactor, with a pleasing honey-toned drawl." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, she spoke the {{required}} words of repentance for political abuse of psychiatry which had had unprecedented dimensions in the Soviet Union for discrediting, intimidation and {{suppression of the}} human rights movement carried out primarily in this institution. Her words were widely broadcast abroad but were published only in the St. Petersburg newspaper Chas Pik within the country. However, in her 2001 book Aliyans Prava i Milosediya (The Alliance of Law and Mercy), Dmitrieva wrote that there were no psychiatric abuses <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> more than in Western countries. Moreover, the book makes the charge that professor Vladimir Serbsky and other intellectuals were wrong not to cooperate with the police department in preventing revolution and bloodsheds and that the current generation is wrong to oppose the regime. In 2007, Dmitrieva asserted that the practice of [...] "punitive psychiatry" [...] had been grossly exaggerated, while nothing wrong had been done by the Serbsky Institute. After that an official at the Serbsky Institute declared [...] "patient" [...] Vladimir Bukovsky, who was then going to run for the President of the Russian Federation, undoubtedly [...] "psychopathic".|$|E

2500|$|MacMahon {{found their}} {{arguments}} [...] "wholly unconvincing." [...] There {{was no evidence}} of fraud in the inducement of the contract, and even if there had been the Prima Paint separability rule required that the arbitrator decide that question unless the fraud claim was specific to the arbitration clause itself, which was not the case in the McMahons' suit. Fraud was also well within the scope of the arbitration clause, he wrote. Nor did the state action waive the arbitration clause since it largely concerned different issues and [...] "that proceeding has no bearing on this action <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> effect on plaintiffs' agreement to arbitrate".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the claim}} was made {{repeatedly}} that subsequent investigations disproved {{the charges of}} the Bryce Report, {{this is not the}} case. [...] There was no systematic attempt to analyze the findings of the Committee, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> official re-investigation. [...] Read, the most scholarly of the revisionists, compared eyewitness reports in three towns with the reports of the post-war Belgian Commission of Inquest. [...] In Mechelen and Elewijt, there are certainly some dubious allegations among the Bryce Committee witnesses. [...] However, the 14 reports from Aalst are almost entirely corroborated by testimony from the Belgian Commission. [...] Most of the slashings, stabbings, and burnings described by witnesses were likely to have taken place.|$|E

2500|$|Prior {{to about}} 1920, the food demands of Bengal's growing {{population}} could be met {{in part by}} bringing undeveloped lands under the plough. Probably {{around the turn of}} the twentieth century, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> later than the early 1930s, Bengal began to experience an acute shortage of land and a chronic and growing shortage of rice. Bengal's agricultural inability to keep pace with rapid population growth changed it from a net exporter to a net importer of foodgrains. Although imports constituted a small part of the total production, this may have been accompanied by a decrease in average consumption levels; it was estimated in 1930 that the Bengali diet was the least nutritious in the world: ...|$|E
2500|$|However, the South Side [...] "policy"-game {{takeover}} by the Outfit was {{not complete}} until another Outfit member, Jackie [...] "the Lackey" [...] Cerone, scared [...] "Big Jim" [...] Martin to Mexico with two bullets {{to the head}} that did not kill him. When the lottery money started rolling in for The Outfit after this gambling war, the amount that this game had produced for The Outfit was in {{the millions of dollars}} a year and brought Giancana further notice. It is believed to have been a major factor in his being [...] "anointed" [...] as the Outfit's new boss when Accardo stepped aside from being the front boss to becoming [...] "consigliere," [...] in 1957. However, it was generally understood that Accardo and Ricca still held the real power. Giancana was required to consult Accardo and Ricca on all important Outfit affairs.

2500|$|Additionally, no decrypts {{have come}} to light of JN-25B traffic with any {{intelligence}} value prior to Pearl Harbor, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>no</b> such has been identified. Such breaks as recorded by authors W. J. Holmes and Clay Blair Jr., were into the additive tables, which was a required second step of three (see above). The first 100 JN-25 decrypts from all sources in date/time order of translation have been released, and {{are available in the}} National Archives. The first JN-25B decrypt was in fact by HYPO (Hawaii) on 8 January 1942 (numbered #1 up JN-25B RG38 CNSG Library, Box 22, 3222/82 NA CP). The first 25 decrypts were very short messages or partial decrypts of marginal intelligence value. As Whitlock stated, [...] "The reason that not one single JN-25 decrypt made prior to Pearl Harbor has ever been found or declassified is not due to any insidious cover-up... it is due quite simply to the fact that no such decrypt ever existed. It simply was not within the realm of our combined cryptologic capability to produce a usable decrypt at that particular juncture." ...|$|E
