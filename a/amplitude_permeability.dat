40|$|Cardiomyocyte {{death is}} now {{recognized}} as {{a critical factor in}} the development of heart disease. Mitochondria are not only responsible for energy production to ensure that cardiac output meets the body’s energy demands, but they serve as critical integrators of cell survival signals. Numerous stressors are known to induce cell death by necrosis and/or apoptosis mediated through mitochondrial dysregulation. Anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl- 2 family proteins regulate apoptosis by controlling mitochondrial outer membrane permeability, whereas opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PT-pore) induces large <b>amplitude</b> <b>permeability</b> of the inner membrane and consequent rupture of the outer membrane. Akt {{is one of the best}} described survival kinases activated by receptor ligands and its activation preserves mitochondrial integrity and protects cardiomyocytes against necrotic and apoptotic death. The mechanisms responsible for Akt-mediated mitochondrial protection have not been fully elucidated. There is, however, accumulating evidence that multiple Akt target molecules, recruited through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, directly impinge upon and protect mitochondria. In this review we discuss mechanisms by which Akt activation can effect changes at the mitochondria that protect cardiomyocytes and attenuate pathophysiological responses of the heart...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In fenite data books the {{reversible}} permeability for small excitation levels is usually given vs. external dc magnetic field for different {{values of the}} effective permeability. To determine these curves the incremental permeability has to be measured on cores with different air gaps. Due to the grinding of different air gaps the determination of those curves is very costly. Also a judgement of the incremental permeability from ring cores, which {{are used in the}} material development, is not possible. In this paper the calculation of the incremental permeability for cores with homogeneous cross section from measured data of ring cores is presented. The {{reversible permeability}} vs. dc magnetic field and the <b>amplitude</b> <b>permeability</b> vs. flux density has to be measured. With those data the reversible permeability vs. flux density for the ring core can be calculated. Gans made the assumption that the reversible permeability vs. flux density is a material property. By calculating the drop of the flux density due to an air gap the incremental permeability for a gapped core with homogeneous cross section can be calculated {{as a function of the}} external dc magnetic field. Calculated and measured data for E-cores made of the S+M material N 87 are in excellent accordance. 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a fast algorithm for estimating formation permeability from Stoneley wave logs. The procedure uses a simplified Biot-Rosenbaum model formulation. The input to the inversion is the Stoneley wave spectral amplitudes at each depth and receiver, the borehole fluid properties (velocity and density), the borehole caliper log, the formation density and porosity (from log data), and the compressional and shear velocities for the interval of interest. The model uses the borehole caliper and elastic properties {{to compute the}} Stoneley wave excitation (that is, predicted <b>amplitude</b> without <b>permeability</b> effects) {{as a function of}} frequency, and the porosity and permeability to compute the fluid flow amplitude reduction. This method also uses a reference depth of known <b>permeability</b> and compares <b>amplitude</b> variations at other depths relative to the reference depth. The permeability value obtained from the inversion represents the best fit over all receivers and all relevant frequencies. A processing example is shown to demonstrate the ability of this technique to extract formation permeability from Stoneley wave logs...|$|R
30|$|One of the {{challenges}} {{in the design of}} microwave absorbers lies in tunable <b>amplitude</b> of dynamic <b>permeability.</b> In this work, we demonstrate that electric-field-induced magnetoelastic anisotropy in nano-granular film FeCoB-SiO 2 /PMN-PT (011) composites can be used to tune the amplitude of ferromagnetic resonance peak at room temperature. The FeCoB magnetic particles are separated from each other by SiO 2 insulating matrix and present slightly different in-plane anisotropy fields. As a result, multi-resonances appear in the imaginary permeability (μ″) curve and mixed together to form a broadband absorption peak. The amplitude of the resonance peak could be modulated by external electric field from 118 to 266.|$|R

For that purpose, biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) coated with acrylic/polyvinylidene chloride (BOPPAcPVDC) and biaxially oriented coextruded polypropylene (BOPPcoex) were used. Physical-chemical profile of samples was determined using goniometry. There is a significant impact only of extreme high power ultrasound conditions (the longest time and the highest <b>amplitude)</b> on the <b>permeability,</b> solubility and diffusion coefficients of oxygen through the BOPP films.

It is found that convection is always three-dimensional and that the critical Rayleigh number always decreases as either the period or the <b>amplitude</b> of the <b>permeability</b> variation increases. Furthermore, the corresponding Floquet exponent ν is either 0 or 1, and the range of values of P over which ν = 1 corresponds to the favoured mode has been obtained as a function of A...|$|R
30|$|Mitochondria {{plays an}} {{important}} role in H 2 O 2 induced apoptosis and cell death. Mitochondrial dysfunction caused by H 2 O 2 causes the collapse of the electrochemical gradient or mitochondrial membrane potential (referred to as ΔΨm or MMP) across the mitochondrial membrane. This releases into the cytosol key apoptogenic proteins that triggers cell demise via apoptosis [27, 28]. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) is a voltage sensitive ion channel that resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This channel opens up under oxidative stress thus permitting the movement of large molecular weight solutes between the mitochondrial matrix and cytoplasm [27]. Thus, H 2 O 2 induced oxidative stress in cells causes the inner membrane of mitochondria (which is normally impermeable) to become permeable, leading to a “large <b>amplitude</b> swelling” (<b>permeability</b> transition) and the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential. The results in this study show that PTE pre-treatment attenuated the loss of MMP induced by H 2 O 2 in a dose-dependent manner and the reduction was significant at the highest concentration of 125  μg/ml and 250  μg/ml of PTE (Fig. 6). The results suggest that PTE is neuroprotective against H 2 O 2 induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in dIMR 32 cells via the mitochondrial pathway by altering the mitochondrial membrane potential and thus reducing cascade of events that leads to apoptosis.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} {{intended}} as a tutorial on electromagnetic modeling to measure and estimate the complex valued relative permeability of magnetic steel. The main application is with the estimation of the electromagnetic material parameters of the armour wires used with high-voltage AC power cables. When the magnetic field intensity is sufficiently far from saturating the magnetic steel, the magnetic hysteresis phenomena can {{be approximated by using}} a linearization approach based on a complex valued (and frequency and <b>amplitude</b> dependent) relative <b>permeability.</b> In the report it is demonstrated how the complex valued permeability of magnetic steel can be efficiently estimated {{in the presence of a}} strong skin-effect. This is achieved by using a simple transformer coil built on the magnetic steel to be tested and by efficient numerical modeling based on waveguide theory and complex analysis.

40|$|AbstractTreatment of {{isolated}} mitochondria with Ca 2 + and inorganic phosphate (Pi) induces an inner membrane permeability {{that appears to}} be mediated through a cyclosporin A (CsA) -inhibitable Ca 2 +-dependent pore. Isolated mitochondria during inner membrane permeability undergo rapid efflux of matrix solutes such as glutathione as GSH and Ca 2 +, loss of coupled functions, and large <b>amplitude</b> swelling. <b>Permeability</b> transition without large amplitude swelling, a parameter often used to assess inner membrane permeability, has been observed. The addition of either oligomycin, antimycin, or sulfide to incubation buffer containing Ca 2 + and Pi abolished large amplitude swelling of mitochondria. The GSH status during a Ca 2 +- and Pi-dependent mechanism of mitochondrial GSH release in isolated mitochondria was influenced significantly by metabolic inhibitors of the respiratory chain but did not prevent inner membrane permeability as demonstrated by the release of mitochondrial GSH and Ca 2 +. The release of GSH was inhibited by the addition of CsA, a potent inhibitor of permeability transition. Under these conditions we did not find GSSG; however, rapid oxidation of pyridine nucleotides and depletion of ATP and ADP with conversion to AMP occurred. The addition of CsA, prevented the oxidation of pyridine nucleotides and depletion of ATP and ADP. Since NADH and NADPH were extensively oxidized, protection against oxidative stress is reflected in maintenance of GSH and not observable lipid peroxidation. Evidence from transmission electron microscopy analysis, combined with the GSH release data, indicate that permeability transition can be observed in the absence of large amplitude swelling...|$|R
40|$|Argillite is {{considered}} a privileged candidate for long term nuclear waste storage. Yet argillite rock drilling often induces surface cracks that locally modify its permeability. This phenomenon located in a so-called Excavation Damaged Zone (EDZ) is of importance since permeability increase means lesser confinement capacity of the argillite rock. Potentially influencial phenomena occur when argillite is subjected simultaneously to normal stress variations and fluid seepage. Therefore, this extensive experimental study (6 month duration) on macro-cracked Callovo-Oxfordian argillite is aimed at distinguishing the contribution to rock permeability of mechanical loading (crack opening and closing) on one part and of chemically active fluid seepage (water) on the other. Steady state gas flow tests show that permeability K mainly depends upon crack closure cc, with values {{on the order of}} 10 − 14 m 2. Permeability from transient water flow tests varies with test duration from 10 − 18 to 10 − 21 m 2. In both test types, K also depends upon confining pressure Pc, mainly during the first three loading–unloading phases. A difference between water injection tests and gas injection tests is that the water-saturated rock sample swells. Swelling does not contribute to unload the crack zone but rather creates additional closure and pressure in the crack area. Indeed, water permeability is shown to depend upon cumulated crack closure ac, which sums up swelling and confinement-induced crack closure. Finally, this study outlines the strong effect of water upon crack closure <b>amplitude</b> and <b>permeability.</b> After a relatively short time (on the order of ten days), water flow within the crack drives the permeability back to very low values close to sound rock permeability (10 − 21 m 2). This reflects a complete self-sealing of the macro-crack, which is an important factor for nuclear waste repository safety...|$|R
40|$|Exposure of receptor-rich {{membrane}} fragments from Torpedo marmorata to carbamylcholine {{causes a}} slow (half-time of 5 [...] 10 min) and reversible change of {{properties of the}} cholinergic receptor protein manifested by a decrease of the initial rate of Naja nigricollis alpha-[3 H]toxin binding {{in the presence of}} carbamylcholine. This change corresponds to a 5 - to 20 -fold increase of affinity for carbamylcholine. Other agonists, acetylcholine, phenyltrimethylammonium, show the same effect but not the antagonists d-tubocurarine and flaxedil. Decamethonium and hexamethonium show little, if any, agonistic effect in vitro on the same membrane fragments but cause the affinity change. This regulatory property can be lost after aging of the preparation of membrane fragments. Since the affinity increase progresses with a similar time course as the decrease of <b>amplitude</b> of the <b>permeability</b> response consecutive to agonist preincubation, it is proposed that, in the membrane at rest, the receptor protein is present under a state of low affinity for agonists and that the reversible stabilization by the agonists of a high affinity state corresponds to the "pharmacological desensitization" of the system as predicted by one of the models of Katz and Thesleff...|$|R

We hypothesized that minocycline induced MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 inhibition can be enhanced by aspirin, a non-selective COX and tPA inhibitor and this combination can reduce progression of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by streptozotocin (55 mg/kg i. p.). Four weeks after diabetes induction rats were treated with minocycline (50 mg/kg, p. o.) per se, aspirin (50 mg/kg, p. o.) per se, or minocycline in combination with aspirin for a period of four weeks. At the end of eighth week rats were anesthetized and electroretinograms were recorded. B-wave latency, B-wave <b>amplitude</b> and retinal <b>permeability</b> were measured. Histology was done and retinal thickness was measured. Zymography was carried out for MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 level determinations. B-wave amplitude was significantly decreased while B- wave latency was significantly increased in diabetic group when compared with normo-glycemic rats. Treatment with combination of minocycline and aspirin significantly reversed B-wave amplitude and latency compared with vehicle-treated diabetic controls. Blood retinal permeability and retinal thickness were also significantly attenuated by the treatment of minocycline in combination with aspirin. Results of the present study suggest that MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 inhibition in presence of COX inhibitor prevents the development of experimental diabetic retinopathy in rats and can be a potential approach for the treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{southern}} Hikurangi Subduction Margin {{is characterized}} by significant accretion with predicted high rates of fluid expulsion. Bottom simulating reflections (BSRs) are widespread on this margin, predominantly occurring beneath thrust ridges. We present seismic data across the Porangahau Ridge on the outer accretionary wedge. The data show high-amplitude reflections above the regional BSR level. Based on polarity and reflection strength, we interpret these reflections as being caused by free gas. We propose {{that the presence of}} gas above the regional level of BSRs indicates local upwarping of the base of gas hydrate stability caused by advective heatflow from upward migrating fluids, although we cannot entirely rule out alternative processes. Simplified modelling of the increase of the thermal gradient associated with fluid flow suggests that funnelling of upward migrating fluids beneath low-permeability slope basins into the Porangahau Ridge would not lead to the pronounced thermal anomaly inferred from upwarping of the base of gas hydrate stability. Focussing of fluid flow is predicted to take place deep in the accretionary wedge and/or the underthrust sediments. Above the high-amplitude reflections, sediment reflectivity is low. A lack of lateral continuity of reflections suggests that reflectivity is lost because of a destruction of sediment layering from deformation rather than gas-hydrate-related <b>amplitude</b> blanking. Structural <b>permeability</b> from fracturing of sediments during deformation may facilitate fluid expulsion on the ridge. A gap in the BSR {{in the southern part of}} the study area may be caused by a loss of gas during fluid expulsion. We speculate that gaps in otherwise continuous BSRs that are observed beneath some thrusts on the Hikurangi Margin may be characteristic of other locations experiencing focussed fluid expulsion...|$|R
