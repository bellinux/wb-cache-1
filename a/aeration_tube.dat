40|$|AbstractIt {{is common}} to apply {{aeration}} facility in lakes, rivers, estuaries and ponds where the dissolved oxygen concentration needs to be increased. Among sufficient aeration facilities, the microporous aeration systems, with advantaged energy-saving, environmental protection, easy installation, adaptability and other good characteristics, are popular for aquaculture ponds or aeration tank in sewage treatment plant. A microporous aeration system mainly includes an air compressor, air diffuser and air supply line to connect air compressor and air diffuser, where air diffuser is often empirically a disc rolled up by a length of <b>aeration</b> <b>tube.</b> In fact, what kind of shape rolled up by the length of <b>aeration</b> <b>tube</b> is still an open question for optimal oxygen mass transfer coefficient. So a series of re-oxygenation experiments were attempted under different shapes of air diffuser rolled up by a same length of <b>aeration</b> <b>tube</b> in laboratory. The shapes were I-shape, C-shape, S-shape and Disc-shape. The experimental apparatus mainly includes one glass tank, a microporous aeration system and a dissolved oxygen meter. The sizes of the glass tank were 2 m × 0. 8 m × 0. 8 m (length × width × height). The different shapes of air diffuser were fixed {{in the center of}} the tank bottom. The diffused-air flow rate was set among 0. 6 - 1. 8 m 3 /h and the water depth was set of 0. 4 m, 0. 55 m, 0. 7 m. Based on the Standard Test Method for Oxygen from American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the oxygen volumetric mass transfer coefficients were calculated. The results showed that the optimal aeration efficiency is under the use of I-shaped diffuser, and then C-shaped and disc-shaped diffuser, the poorest one is the use of S-shape. When the air-free water surface mass transfer was cut off by covering plastics film on the top of the tank, the oxygen volumetric mass transfer coefficients of I-shaped, C-shaped, S-shaped and disc-shaped diffusers were decreased. The best aeration performance is I-shape, the poorest one is S-shape...|$|E
30|$|A {{continuous}} {{stirred tank}} bioreactor (CSTBR) {{has been developed}} by incorporating an innovative gas supply and effluent extraction system to ferment syngas into ethanol. The working volume of the bioreactor was controlled to 2  L. The CO gas was fermented in the developed bioreactor by using a microorganism (Clostridium ljungdahlii) with different gas (5 – 15  mL/min), media, and effluent flow rates (0.25 – 0.75  mL/min) and stirrer speed (300 – 500  rpm). Gas was diffused into the fermenting broth through an aqueous <b>aeration</b> <b>tube</b> commonly used in the small household aquarium, placed at the bottom layer throughout the periphery. The effluent was extracted from {{the top layer of}} the broth by using a membrane separator. Ethanol and acetic acid concentrations were varied from 0.17 – 1.17 and 8.50 – 23.68  g/L-effluent, respectively.|$|E
30|$|Syngas {{fermentation}} into ethanol {{was noted}} to {{be dependent on}} the mass transfer between gas and liquid (Huhnke 2013; Lee 2010). The mass transfer can be improved by increasing the residence time of gas in the aqueous media (Lee 2010). The bubbling technology helps in improving the gas retention time in the aqueous media. Although the size of bubbles affects the retention time, an <b>aeration</b> <b>tube</b> (that is commonly used in small household aquariums) has been selected to create a circular gas supply system (diameter is 4  cm smaller than the reactor’s inside diameter) and placed {{at the center of the}} bioreactor with the help of a holder keeping a clearance of about 1  cm from the bottom (Additional file 1 : SI- 1 - 2). The purpose of the holder is so that gas can be diffused at the peripheral area of the fermentation broth, which can easily be replaced with other bubbling systems.|$|E
40|$|Thirteen pilot-scale Sludge Drying Reed Bed {{units have}} been {{constructed}} and operated under various design and operational characteristics. All the beds included a cobbles bottom layer, where perforated PVC <b>aeration</b> <b>tubes</b> were placed. One bed did not contain <b>aeration</b> <b>tubes.</b> Two gravel layers were placed above the cobbles layer. The setup included planted beds with common reeds and control units. Three sludge loading rates were examined: 30, 60 and 75 kg dm/m 2 /yr. The dewatering efficiency of the planted units exceeded 95 % volume reduction. The final dry matter content varied between 50 and 64 %, depending on the applied SLR. Mineralization of the residual sludge also took place. VS content of the planted units decreased up to 20 %, while nutrient concentration was also reduced. The presence of reeds, <b>aeration</b> <b>tubes</b> and a fine-grained material improved the system efficiency, while the material composition {{did not have any}} effect on efficiency. Moreover, the units were able to treat sludge with high concentration of Cr...|$|R
40|$|Thirteen pilot-scale {{sludge drying}} reed bed (SDRB) units have been {{constructed}} and operated under various settings. The beds included a cobbles lower layer, where perforated PVC <b>aeration</b> <b>tubes</b> were placed, and two gravel layers on top. The setup included planted beds with common reeds and control units. Three sludge loading rates (SLR) were examined: 30, 60 and 75 kg dm/m 2 /yr. Heavy metal (HM) accumulation in the residual sludge layer was negligible or low, and was found to increase with sludge layer depth. Plant uptake was low; the belowground biomass accumulated significantly more HMs compared to the aboveground biomass. Less than 16 % of the influent HM left the bed through drainage. HM accumulation in the gravel layer was the major metal sink in the mass balance. On the whole, the HM content of the residual sludge was below the legal limits proposed by the EU for land application...|$|R
40|$|Ten pilot-scale, cylindrical, {{vertical}} flow constructed wetlands (area 0. 57 m 2) {{were constructed}} and operated continuously {{for three years}} in parallel experiments, treating synthetic wastewater, simulating the first treatment stage of full-scale systems. The wetland units were planted with two plant species (i. e., common reeds and cattails), had different porous media material composition (i. e., carbonate, igneous, zeolite and bauxite) and three different total substrate thicknesses and gradations. Three loading/resting schedules were used. Water quality samples were collected at the inlet and the outlet of each unit, and were analyzed in the laboratory for the determination of various pollutants. The VFCW units were quite efficient in organic matter (BOD 5 and COD) and nitrogen (TKN and NH 4 +-N) removal, with mean removal efficiencies exceeding 78 % and 58 %, respectively. Mean phosphorus (TP and OP) removal was lower (37 %). The units were found to provide significant pollutant removal under high organic loads, up to 200 g COD/m 2 d. The presence of reeds and <b>aeration</b> <b>tubes</b> was found to improve the performance, while plant species did not affect efficiency. The use of special materials, aiming at enhancing the adsorption of different constituents, did not improve the wetland efficiency, probably due to limited contact time between material and wastewater, and is not recommended...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Traumatic perilymphatic fistula {{is not a}} rare {{event with}} regards to sport {{activities}} or traffic accident. However, iatrogenic damage to the inner ear can occur following the common use of grommets and ventilation tube insertion. Objectives To report an unusual case of insertion of <b>aeration</b> <b>tube</b> into the vestibule trough the stapes footplate. Resumed Report A 62 -year-old woman experienced iatrogenic penetration into the vestibule from a ventilation tube inserted for retraction pocket management. The event was misdiagnosed both by the surgeon and by the emergency room physicians, leading to delay in the management. However, preservation of the hearing function lasted for 2 weeks prior to deafness, thanks to the valve of Bast, which preserved the cochlear fluid. Conclusion This case gives {{us the opportunity to}} stress the need for systematic clinical examination of traumatic injury to the ear and to recommend performing multiplanar millimetric computed tomography scan with accurate interpretation. Traumatic injuries should be referred to a dedicated traumatic emergency referral center...|$|E

Diffusers or spargers can also be designed into the system to cause turbulence or mixing if desired.|$|R
