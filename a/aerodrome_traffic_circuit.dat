40|$|The {{proposed}} book contains in six separate chapters {{contributions to}} the variety of aspects of the interdisciplinary research and development work performed during the recent ten years towards the goal of replacing the conventional airport control tower by a new "Remote Tower" work environment (RTO). As a first step small, low-traffic airports are addressed with the expectation of increasing work efficiency and safety and reducing cost. This revolutionary human-system interface allows for remote <b>aerodrome</b> <b>traffic</b> control without the physical tower building {{and at the same}} time enables the establishment of Remote Airport Traffic Control Centers (RTC) where several airports will be controlled from a central location. Following a preface and an introduction into the subject the ca. 23 separate contributions are grouped into six chapters which cover the following topics: Fundamentals (<b>Aerodrome</b> <b>Traffic</b> Control, visual information / visual cues, aircraft detection/SSO-model), Human-in-the-Loop Simulations for Requirements and Design (work analysis, communication issues, RTO /RTC human-in-the-loop simulations, requirements from two-alternative decision experiments), RTO-Design and Engineering (videopanorama design and engineering, automation, movement detection), RTO-/RTC-Validation (operational issues, shadow-mode tests, data analysis and advanced methods), Alternative Approaches and Perspectives (US-FAA Approach, future perspectives: synthetic vision and VR), and Appendix (practical guidelines on structured work analysis, Questionaires, technical design fundamentals, signal detection theory / Bayes inference for data analysis, RTO/RTC simulator environment).

Microlight traffic forms a considerable part of the local <b>aerodrome</b> <b>traffic</b> and flight training is provided by The Microlight School.

On 26 July 2005, the airline went into administration and all EUjet flights ended, along with all non-freight operations at the airport, owing to financial difficulties with the airline and airport owner, PlaneStation. Their business plan was ambitious and when the bank lenders foreclosed many passengers were left stranded abroad. London Manston Airport plc went into liquidation.

40|$|Abstract — Laser {{detection}} and tracking of aircrafts based systems (LIDARs, LIgth Detection And Ranging systems) are {{emerging as a}} critical design trend in development of new generation ATM (Air Traffic Management) paradigms, {{of which they are}} the main innovations. The realization of laser sensors as rotating laser range-finder arrays and their combination to versatile systems lead to major advantages for the application such as Air <b>Traffic</b> Control within <b>Aerodrome</b> <b>Traffic</b> Zone (ATZ), airport surveillance and ground to air laser communications, and last but not least to save cost usually at the same time with getting an improved ATC (Air Traffic Control) performance. These laser systems that today can be developed without particular difficulties are challenging classical ATM paradigms in many aspects. Nevertheless, it is commonly recognized that the effectiveness of these systems strictly relies on the capability to reliably perform a track data fusion with airpor...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the recent research activities aimed at developing a flexible and low-cost measurement {{system for the}} determination of aviation-related pollutant concentrations in dense air traffic areas. The proposed bistatic Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system includes an airborne component and a ground-based component. The airborne component consists of a tuneable laser emitter installed on an Unmanned Aircraft (UA) and the ground-based component is constituted by a target surface calibrated for reflectance and a rail-mounted camera calibrated for radiance. The system performs Differential Absorption LIDAR (DIAL) measurements. The specific implementation for the measurement of CO 2 in the <b>aerodrome</b> <b>traffic</b> zone of a major airport is studied in this paper. The analytical and empirical models to directly estimate the extinction coefficients are also presented and uncertainty analysis is performed for a preliminary validation of the bistatic DIAL system. The relevant opportunities and challenges, and {{the viability of the}} system in the intended operational domains are also discussed. The presented numerical results show satisfactory performances in term of accuracy and precision even in degraded meteorological conditions, which are comparable to the more complex and relatively costly techniques currently available...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — With {{multimedia}} and Internet enabled devices being ubiquitous, {{mechanisms that}} ensure multimedia flows do not congest the Internet are crucial components of multimedia {{systems that are}} embraced rather than opposed by network service providers. The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) Circuit Breaker is designed to terminate RTP/UDP flows that cause excessive congestion in the network. Multimedia users congesting the network have their flows terminated, as dictated by the RTP circuit breaker congestion rule. Users who obtain little quality from a multimedia session, and consume network resources to no avail, should also cease transmission. This is {{the mandate of the}} RTP circuit breaker media usability rule. We propose an algorithm for this rule, and show that it avoids wasting network resources on flows that deliver no quality to the user.
