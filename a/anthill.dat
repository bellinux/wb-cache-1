5|$|Meanwhile, {{the same}} day Haldane ordered US 1/28th Battalion to closely explore the tunnels in their area of operations, {{uncovering}} a number chambers and trapdoors defended by grenades and booby traps. A Company subsequently located another tunnel system after an American {{was killed by a}} Viet Cong soldier who suddenly appeared out of a large <b>anthill.</b> Later, as the 1/503rd continued to search its area with platoon-size patrols during the afternoon of 13 January, a clash between Company C and a Viet Cong platoon developed into a heavy contact. An air-strike was successfully called in by the Americans however, and a search of the area recovered 10 dead Viet Cong, while blood trails and human remains indicated that perhaps another 20 were also killed.|$|E
5|$|To {{break contact}} with the Viet Cong units which fired on Alpha Company from the western flank, First Sergeant Jose Valdez quickly {{organized}} an assembly area {{on the eastern side}} to round up the survivors. Shortly after the assembly area was established George, who was severely wounded from the Claymore explosion, turned his company over to Valdez. Allen then ordered Valdez to lead the survivors of Alpha Company northward to join the rest of the battalion. The survivors, mostly from the 2nd and 3rd Platoons of Alpha Company, were then ordered to withdraw through a perimeter formed by Delta Company. As the surviving elements of Alpha Company pulled back, Delta Company began to receive sporadic fire from their southern flank, so Allen ordered his command group to remain in place near a prominent <b>anthill</b> with the 1st and 2nd Platoons of Delta Company. The 3rd Platoon, on the other hand, was instructed to move forward to assist the wounded men from Alpha Company.|$|E

25|$|Domestic kobolds {{are linked}} to a {{specific}} household. Some legends claim that every house has a resident kobold, regardless of its owners' desires or needs. The means by which a kobold enters a new home vary from tale to tale. One tradition claims that the kobold enters the household by announcing itself at night by strewing wood chips about the house and putting dirt or cow manure in the milk cans. If {{the master of the}} house leaves the wood chips and drinks the soiled milk, the kobold takes up residence. The kobold Heinzelmann of Hundermühlen Castle arrived in 1584 and announced himself by knocking and making other sounds. Should someone take pity on a kobold {{in the form of a}} cold, wet creature and take it inside to warm it, the spirit takes up residence there. A tradition from Perleberg in northern Germany says that a homeowner must follow specific instructions to lure a kobold to his house. He must go on St John's Day between noon and one o'clock, into the forest. When he finds an <b>anthill</b> with a bird on it, he must say a certain phrase, which causes the bird to transform into a small person. The figure then leaps into a bag carried by the homeowner, and he can then transfer the kobold to his home. Even if servants come and go, the kobold stays.|$|E

2500|$|Communities remain {{strongly}} patriarchal, and polygamy {{is commonly}} practiced. Endogamy is also practiced among some Bara clans. The male {{head of the}} family often has a dual role as the spiritual leader of the household. Traditionally, inheritance rights strongly favored males; daughters were restricted from inheriting anything other than movable property. Gender roles were strictly defined. Men prepared the soil of the rice fields, purchased or hunted for food, gathered firewood, built the family home and furniture, and engaged in discussion and debate about public affairs. Women were responsible for growing crops for sale or family consumption, weeding the rice fields, harvesting and processing the rice, gathering water, lighting the hearth fire and preparing daily meals, and weaving. As recently as the late 19th century, women were forbidden from eating until after the men had finished, and could not look at them while they ate. [...] At birth, a village ombiasy (seer) was typically consulted to determine whether the child was destined for a fortunate or unhappy fate. If the latter, an exorcism was practiced whereby the infant would be slid down a chute into a body of water where his mother would retrieve him, and if it was deemed that the evil destiny was too strong for the exorcism rite to overcome it, the Bara infant would be left on an <b>anthill</b> to die.|$|E

Andrew E's 1991 hit [...] "Humanap Ka Ng Pangit" [...] was the first to spawn a plethora of response records from other rappers in the country, such as Michael V's [...] "Maganda Ang Piliin" [...] (Pick Someone Pretty). The rapper's ability to combine unique storytelling with raunchy and humorous wordplay laced with catchy beats made Andrew the first of his kind in the genre. He then went on to release a movie entitled Andrew Ford Medina: Huwag Kang Gamol in 1991 which was the first film in the Philippines to include a full-on freestyle battle on screen.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{woody species}} diversity, composition and vegetation structure {{in a dry}} forest Miombo woodland at Mazowe botanical reserve. All woody species were systematically identified and measured in 45 sample plots. Analysis of inventory data was done using Microsoft Excel. Four vegetation communities identified along the river, <b>anthills,</b> hills and slope areas of the reserve were demarcated. Relative Density, dominance, frequency, and species and family importance values were computed to characterize the species composition. A total of 108 woody species belonging to 78 genera and 41 families were recorded. Members of the Fabaceae subfamily Caesalpinoideae were dominant with 6 genera and 9 species. Stem densities/ha were high ranged from 572 on the <b>anthills</b> to 2040 along the river valley. The dbh distribution showed an inverse “J ” shaped curve, meaning that there is active regeneration and recruitment in the woodlands. Shannon-Wiener Index of diversity values ranged from 1. 85 in the slope area to 3. 42 on the <b>anthills</b> showing high species diversity in the reserve. This study reveals that the Mazowe botanical reserve has a high species richness and diversity. This is mainly due to the diversity of habitats like river valleys, <b>anthills,</b> streams, hills and slopes for species establishment. A number of anthropogenic activities have been recorded in the reserve notably fire and tree cutting.
