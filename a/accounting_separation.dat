50|$|Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) {{presents}} {{the principle of}} the separation of concerns, allowing less interdependence, and more transparency. Thereby, an aspect is a module that encapsulates a crosscutting concern, and it is composed of pointcuts and advice bodies. The interception of an aspect is performed in a join point (a point in the execution flow), and defined inside a pointcut (a set of join points). Whenever the application execution reaches one pointcut, an advice (namely a callback) associated with it is executed.

40|$|It is {{sometimes}} forgotten that the much debated remedy of functional separation {{is simply a}} means to an end. That end is to reduce the incentives for discrimination by the integrated firm, which damages its downstream rivals and ultimately harms competition and the interests of consumers. Functional separation, though now considered to be at the centre of the Undertakings was in fact not mentioned by name in them. This article examines the background to the Undertakings and why non-discrimination and <b>accounting</b> <b>separation</b> remedies were inadequate to deter sabotage behaviour. It draws on interviews with UK industry participants to consider whether equivalence and functional separation are "fit for purpose".

40|$|As well known, in the {{analysis}} of bird impact events the bird is often reduced, even experimentally, to a surrogate projectile modeled as a weakly compressible fluid (typically a mixture of water and air). From a numerical standpoint, the presence of a free surface and the strong interaction with the aircraft structures represent a limit for traditional computational fluid dynamics methods based on an Eulerian grid. On the other hand, classical Lagrangian methods cannot cope with the extremely large deformations experienced by the projectile during the impact. The Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) is a Lagrangian particle method that can account for very large deformations, preserving the robustness and generality of the finite element method, and thus owning a key advantage over other approaches, e. g. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), usually cursed with consistency and stability issues. To assess the possibilities of the method in the context of bird impact, theoretical analyses are initially performed based on the impact of a water jet on a rigid surface. Then, the influence of the geometry of a more realistic projectile is analyzed and the capability of the method to take into <b>account</b> <b>separation</b> and fragmentation is highlighted.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} issues and options in {{reforming}} small electricity sector systems in general while citing Nepal as a specific case.

In small systems, the creation of an independent regulatory authority is more important than unbundling of the sector. In the present context of Nepal <b>accounting</b> <b>separation</b> of the main activities may be a pragmatic restructuring approach given the present political and market condition.
