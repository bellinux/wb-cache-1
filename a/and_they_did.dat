5|$|Fifty-eight {{cardinals}} {{were present}} on 9 October when the conclave began. Since Charles II was dying at this time, Spain's cardinal electors were unsure {{of how they}} should vote, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not work closely with electors that were loyal to the Holy Roman Emperor. From the beginning, {{it was clear that}} the impending death of Charles II was likely to cause a lengthy conclave, because the next pope would be expected to respond to the anticipated political crisis in Spain following Charles' imminent death.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{was decided}} that the Common Assembly, which became the Parliament, should instead be based in Strasbourg—the Council of Europe (CoE) was already based there, in the House of Europe. The chamber of the CoE's Parliamentary Assembly could also serve the Common Assembly, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> so until 1999, when a new complex of {{buildings}} was built across the river from the Palace.|$|E

5|$|John, like Basil II before him, was a {{slow but}} steady campaigner. His armies made careful, {{measured}} gains over time, rarely exposing themselves to excessive risks, but nevertheless advancing inexorably towards their objectives. However, the Turks were resilient, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not {{allow themselves to be}} decisively defeated in any one engagement. They knew that it was difficult for the emperor to remain in one theatre of war for a long time, as events elsewhere often intervened that required his attention.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lieutenant Colonel Eyre's {{force of}} 800 men {{landed on the}} east side of the Thames River, but they were slowed by tangled {{woodlands}} and swamplands. The New Jersey Loyalists landed after the initial wave of regulars, also delayed by the difficulty in moving the artillery through rough conditions, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not participate in the assault.|$|E
5|$|After Houston {{received}} word that Santa Anna was leading a large force to San Antonio, Bowie offered to lead volunteers {{to defend the}} Alamo from the expected attack. He arrived with 30men on January 19, where they found a force of 104men with a few weapons and a few cannons, but not many supplies and little gunpowder. Houston {{knew that there were}} not enough men to hold the fort in an attack and had given Bowie authority to remove the artillery and blow up the fortification. Bowie and the Alamo commander, James C. Neill, decided they did not have enough oxen to move the artillery, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not want to destroy the fortress. On January 26, one of Bowie's men, James Bonham, organized a rally which passed a resolution in favor of holding the Alamo. Bonham signed the resolution first, with Bowie's signature second.|$|E

5|$|After the incident, {{the event}} was halted for 15 minutes, until Vince McMahon and other WWF Corporate {{officials}} {{made the decision to}} continue the event. Hart's coworkers, professional wrestlers, and other miscellaneous workers, appeared somber after Hart's fall as they continued to do their jobs. An hour after the event restarted, Ross informed pay-per-view viewers that Hart had {{died at the age of}} 34 at a nearby hospital.

5|$|After the one {{surviving}} roll from Henry I's reign, {{no further}} Pipe rolls survived from his reign, nor are any preserved from {{the reign of}} his successor, King Stephen (reigned 1135–1154). But by {{the second year of}} King Henry II's reign, or 1155, they once more survive. It is unclear if Pipe rolls were actually created during Stephen's reign <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not survive, or if the conditions during Stephen's reign precluded the creation of Pipe rolls. Continuously from the early years of King Henry II's reign, most Pipe rolls survive, with only a break {{in the last years of}} King John's reign (reigned 1199–1216).|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} stages, the storm dropped {{moderately}} heavy rainfall in Florida, which caused damage to crops. A tornado near Miami and high tides {{on the west}} coast of the state also resulted in damage. Overall, losses in Florida were around $1.7million (1959USD). After becoming extratropical, the storm caused significant effects in Atlantic Canada. About 45boats were in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not have radio to receive warning of the approaching storm. Rough seas of up to 49ft (15m) in height damaged or destroyed many boats. At least 22fishing boats capsized over water with their crew, causing 35fatalities. High winds also disrupted communications in some areas, and several houses were damaged, causing $750,000 (1959CAD, $781,000 1959USD). The event became the deadliest work-related disaster in New Brunswick.|$|E

Liverpool were also the reigning English champions, having won the English league during the 1976–77 season. As reigning European Cup champions, they received a bye in the first round. They were drawn against East German champions Dynamo Dresden in the second round. Liverpool were expected to win the first leg, played at Anfield, their home ground, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> so with a score of 5–1. Dresden won the second leg 2-1 at their home ground, Glücksgas Stadium, giving Liverpool a 6–3 win on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{represented}} Great Britain at his maiden Olympics in Beijing 2008. He {{competed in}} the singles and doubles competitions. Despite being seeded sixth in the singles competition, he was eliminated {{in the first round}} by Chinese Taipei's Yen-hsun Lu. Along with his brother Jamie, he advanced to {{the second round of the}} doubles competition with a win over the Canadian pairing of Daniel Nestor and Frédéric Niemeyer. The Murray brothers were eliminated in the second round by France's Arnaud Clément and Michael Llodra. In February, Murray pulled out of the Davis Cup tie against Argentina, because of a knee injury, so Argentina thrashed the under-strength British team. Jamie Murray scathingly criticised Andy <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not speak to each other for a fortnight. Their rift continued in the Olympic doubles, over a perceived lack of effort from Andy.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 1942, Oliphant {{embarked}} from Melbourne, taking Rosa and {{the children}} back with him. The wartime sea voyage on the French Desirade was again a slow one, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not reach Glasgow until 29 February 1943. But {{he had to leave}} them behind once more in November 1943 after he joined the Manhattan Project in the United States as part of the British Mission. Oliphant was one of the scientists whose services the Americans were most eager to secure, and Robert Oppenheimer, the head of the Los Alamos Laboratory attempted to persuade Oliphant to join. The work on the bomb itself made him uneasy, and he preferred to head the team assisting his friend Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley to develop the electromagnetic uranium enrichment– a vital but less overtly military part of the project.|$|E

5|$|Prince Christian {{was given}} the title Prince of Denmark and his family {{moved into a new}} {{official}} residence, Bernstorff Palace. Although the family's status had risen, there was little or no increase in their income <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not participate in court life at Copenhagen as they refused to meet Frederick's third wife and former mistress, Louise Rasmussen, because she had an illegitimate child by a previous lover. Alexandra shared a draughty attic bedroom with her sister, Dagmar (later Empress of Russia), made her own clothes and waited at table along with her sisters. Alexandra and Dagmar were given swimming lessons by the Swedish pioneer of women's swimming, Nancy Edberg. At Bernstorff, Alexandra grew into a young woman; she was taught English by the English chaplain at Copenhagen and was confirmed in Christiansborg Palace. She was devout throughout her life, and followed High Church practice.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds did {{not believe}} there was time to make changes because, {{if there were any}} delays in publication, the {{newspaper}} would not be published {{before the end of the}} school year. After consulting with his supervisors, he opted to publish a four-page newspaper instead of a six-page one, omitting the pages containing the two stories in question. Cutting two pages removed a total of seven articles from the paper. Reynolds did not tell the students about the decision, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not find out about it until the paper was delivered to the school.|$|E
5|$|The Viet Cong {{apparently}} suffered light casualties {{with only}} 32 soldiers officially confirmed killed, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not leave a single casualty on the battlefield. In {{recognition of the}} 271st Regiment's performance during the Bình Giã campaign, the NLF High Command bestowed the title 'Bình Giã Regiment' on the unit to honour their achievement. Following the Bình Giã campaign, the Viet Cong went on to occupy Hoài Đức District and the strategic hamlets of Đất Đỏ, Long Thành and Nhơn Trạch along Inter-provincial Road No. 2 and 15. They also expanded the Hát Dịch base area, which was located in Bà Rịa and Bình Thuận Provinces, to protect the important sea transportation routes used by the Vietnam People's Navy to supply Viet Cong units around the regions of the Mekong River.|$|E

5|$|The couple's first child, Mary Prudentia Hogg, {{was born}} in November 1827. Her parents did their best not to spread the news, because she was born soon after they began cohabiting. Mary Prudentia died in May 1829. Jane gave birth to their second daughter, Prudentia, in 1836, and Mary Shelley was {{selected}} as her godmother. Hogg's friendship with Mary Shelley was disrupted several years later, however, when she republished Percy Shelley's Queen Mab in 1839. Hogg rebuked her for leaving out its previous dedication to Harriet Shelley, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not {{communicate with each other}} for several years.|$|E
5|$|The humor {{magazine}} National Lampoon hired Jean and Reiss {{after they}} graduated in 1981. During the 1980s, the duo began collaborating on various television material. During this period they worked as writers and producers on television {{shows such as}} The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, ALF, Sledge Hammer! and It's Garry Shandling's Show. In 1989, Jean was offered {{a job as a}} writer on the animated sitcom The Simpsons, a show created by Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon that continues to air today. Many of Jean's friends were not interested in working on The Simpsons because it was a cartoon <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not think it would last long. Jean, however, was a fan of the work of Groening, Brooks, and Simon, and therefore took the job together with Reiss.|$|E
5|$|After the January 11 congressional hearing, Ross delayed {{enforcement}} of the FEPC directive to await {{the outcome of the}} upcoming union elections. The PRTEU contract with the PTC was expiring on February 11, 1944 and a union election was called for March 14, 1944. Apart from PRTEU, which was still staunchly opposed to promotions of black employees, there were two other unions competing for the right to represent PTC workers: the Transport Workers Union (TWU), which was a Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) affiliate, and the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America, an American Federation of Labor (AFL) affiliate. The TWU said that it would allow promotions of black employees while the Amalgamated Association stayed silent on the matter. The PRTEU leadership tried to campaign on the race issue during the union elections, but the topic was overshadowed by other issues, such as the details of a new contract with the PTC. After a bitter campaign, the TWU won the union elections, receiving more votes than both of the other unions combined. At the time of the elections many white workers perceived the contract issue to be more important, where the TWU was promising more attractive terms, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not consider promotions of black employees a realistic possibility. Despite the TWU victory, animosities from white workers towards the black employees remained and were largely unabated. The negotiations between the TWU and the PTC on a new contract dragged on, {{and in the absence of}} a contract the company continued to resist implementing the FEPC directives.|$|E
