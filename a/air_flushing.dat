This innovation resulted in higher reduction rates of dissolved benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) than those observed during the continuous operation. Performance monitoring of the <b>air</b> <b>flushing</b> system at 2, 8, and 12  months of pulsed operation indicated an increase in the hydrocarbon removal rate by a factor of up to three as compared to continuous operation, resulting in cost savings from shorter treatment time and less energy usage.|$|E

MÉTODOS: foram estudadas 51 ratas (Wistar) do 2 º dia até o final da gestação, divididas em três grupos: Grupo F: 15 ratas expostas à fumaça de dois cigarros/animal/dia + ar comprimido (10 L/min); Grupo Ar: 18 ratas expostas ao ar comprimido (10 L/min); Grupo C: 18 ratas não manipuladas e não expostas. Os parâmetros aferidos foram: peso das ratas e seu consumo alimentar e comprimento e peso dos filhotes ao nascer.

The equipment used for this step {{is dependent on the}} stability of the material in which the soil nail wall is supporting.

Therefore, coarse sand was artificially polluted and mixed well with waste-lubricant oil at different concentrations of 10, 25 and 50  wt% to give the soil an oil blend. Then a laboratory glass column was established and backed with contaminated soil to study the effect of flow rate, pollutant and surfactant concentrations on the removal of waste-lubricant oil from soil.

This study is made to investigate how the water project of International Aid Services (IAS) is working. First I wanted to get a good image of the different areas connected to the IAS water project such as community mobilization, drilling and water source and sanitation education. At the time of my studies the Community Mobilization Unit (CMU) had just began their work, therefore the system with Water Source and Sanitation Committees had not yet been really implemented.

The drilling is performed using two different methods, Mud Rotary and <b>Air</b> <b>Flush.</b> Mud Rotary is used in clay soil and <b>Air</b> <b>Flush</b> is used in more rocky soil. One of the main problem issues is transport, mainly transport of drilling machines, well material and water used during drilling. Problems in the means of transport are the terrible conditions of the roads which also lead to terrible conditions of the vehicles, especially the heavy vehicles which are very old. Another main problem is supplies, especially supplies of spares for the vehicles and equipment but also food and other essentials. Many things have to be brought from other countries via Khartoum and then by lorry to Northern Bahr el Ghazal. One of my conclusions is that much weight must be put on the county community mobilization to really involve the local people in the project so that they feel responsible for the well after it has been handed over. This is crucial to get full impact of the project. Another conclusion is that if supplies could be handled through Southern Sudan (Juba) it could cut down transport time and costs. But this cannot be realized yet since the range of things in Juba is rather limited compared to Khartoum.

30|$|First, as air is {{introduced}} into contaminated soil, air displaces flushing solution {{in the largest}} pores and creates temporary flushing solution flow around flushing point [12].When an air-flushing system achieves steady state, preferential airflow pathways consisting of the largest network of pores are formed in the soil, and the induced local flushing solution flow ceases [20]. Pulsing air injection frequently creates non-steady-state conditions and induces flushing solution circulation as the air channels form and collapse during each cycle. The induced flushing solution flow created by the pulsed <b>air</b> <b>flushing</b> substantially enhances the contaminant and oxygen mass transfer in the soil [5]. Second, contaminants {{in the immediate vicinity}} of air channels can be removed within few time of the start of flushing, but contaminated present at a greater distance from the air channels is less treated because of the limited mass transport (i.e., diffusion) [8].|$|E

Seven epidemic strains with highly related genomic macrorestriction profiles each infected 2 or more patients, accounting for 29 (55 %) episodes of post-ERCP bacteremia. Strains recovered from endoscopes and from the disinfector were associated with 22 (42 %) and 5 (9 %) bacteremic episodes respectively. Effective endoscope disinfection was achieved by cleansing and disinfection of a blind channel not processed in the disinfector, additional isopropanol- <b>air</b> <b>flush</b> of all channels, and auto-disinfection of the disinfector. In the following period, the incidence of post-ERCP bacteremia returned to the pre- epidemic rate (1. 7 %, p = 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Bacterial genome fingerprinting by macrorestriction analysis enabled delineation of a multi-strain {{outbreak of}} post-ERCP bacteremia. Cross-contamination, {{and to a lesser}} extent, common- source contamination, appeared related to inadequate disinfection of endoscopes processed in an automated disinfector.

40|$|This study {{demonstrated}} {{the effect of}} milling processing (screw crushing, hammer milling and jet milling) on functional properties, such as antioxidant capacity, total phenolic content and resistant starch content of three legumes (broad beans, black soybeans and green beans). The results showed that broad beans possessed the highest antioxidant capacity and resistant starch content. Black soybeans had the highest total phenolic content. Different milling processes changed the functional properties of samples (p< 0. 05) depending on the particle size of the flour and {{the volume of the}} <b>flush</b> <b>air</b> operation. The grinding process, producing a smaller particle size and lower volume of <b>flush</b> <b>air</b> had higher functional properties than the others processes. Therefore, hammer milling was more suitable for grinding to obtain a higher antioxidant capacity, total phenolic and resistant starch content compared to the other process...|$|R
