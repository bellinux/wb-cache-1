5|$|The present {{purpose is}} to {{illustrate}} the role of representation theory of groups in mathematics and in physics. Rigor <b>and</b> <b>detail</b> take the back seat, as the main objective is to fix the notion of finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional representations of the Lorentz group. The reader familiar with these concepts should skip by.|$|E
5|$|Although Etty had {{traditionally}} {{worked in}} the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours <b>and</b> <b>detail,</b> for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, {{and closer to the}} style of Titian. This is likely owing {{to the nature of the}} subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology, and took place in brightly lit Mediterranean settings. The Seasons, by contrast, was seen as an explicitly English work, requiring a more muted palette to deal with the typical lighting conditions of Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Amid German defeats {{against the}} Russians on the Eastern Front after 1942, the King {{prepared}} {{for the end of}} the war. He ordered the preparation of a document, known as the Political Testament (Testament Politique), which would justify his behaviour under the occupation <b>and</b> <b>detail</b> his interventions on behalf of Belgian prisoners of war and deported workers. Leopold however continued to condemn the action of the Belgian government in exile (based in London after October 1940). On 7 June 1944, following D-Day, he was deported to Germany. He was finally liberated by American forces on 7 May 1945.|$|E

5|$|As {{printing}} became available, it {{was promptly}} used to publish herbals, the first printed matter being known as incunabula. In Europe, the first printed herbal with woodcut (xylograph) illustrations, the Puch der Natur of Konrad of Megenberg, appeared in 1475. Metal-engraved plates were first used in about 1580. As woodcuts and metal engravings could be reproduced indefinitely they were traded among printers: there was therefore a large {{increase in the}} number of illustrations together with an improvement in quality <b>and</b> <b>detail</b> but a tendency for repetition.|$|E
5|$|HAL Laboratory {{developed}} Super Smash Bros. Melee, with Masahiro Sakurai as {{the head}} of production. The game {{was one of the first}} games released on the GameCube and highlighted the advancement in graphics from the Nintendo 64. The developers wanted to pay homage to the debut of the GameCube by making an opening full motion video sequence that would attract people's attention to the graphics. HAL worked with three separate graphic houses in Tokyo to make the opening sequence. On their official website, the developers posted screenshots and information highlighting and explaining the attention to physics <b>and</b> <b>detail</b> in the game, with references to changes from its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|He spent £58,000 on {{his royal}} castles, {{carrying}} out major {{works at the}} Tower of London, Lincoln and Dover. Both the military defences and the internal accommodation of these castles were significantly improved. At Windsor, a huge overhaul of the castle produced a lavish palace complex, whose style <b>and</b> <b>detail</b> inspired many subsequent designs in England and Wales. The Tower of London was extended to form a concentric fortress with extensive living quarters, although Henry primarily used the castle as a secure retreat {{in the event of}} war or civil strife. Henry also kept a menagerie at the Tower, a tradition begun by his father, and his exotic specimens included an elephant, a leopard and a camel.|$|E

5|$|Headquartered at the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma, the Storm Prediction Center is {{tasked with}} {{forecasting}} {{the risk of}} severe thunderstorms and tornadoes in the contiguous United States. It issues convective outlooks, mesoscale discussions, and watches {{as a part of}} this process. Convective outlooks are issued for the following eight days (issued separately for Day1, Day2, Day3, and Days 4–8), <b>and</b> <b>detail</b> the risk of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes during the given forecast period, although tornado, hail and wind details are only available for Day 1. Days 2 and 3, as well as 4–8 use a probabilistic scale, determining the probability for a severe weather event in percentage categories.|$|E
5|$|Michelangelo painted {{onto the}} damp plaster using a wash {{technique}} to apply broad areas of colour, {{then as the}} surface became drier, he revisited these areas with a more linear approach, adding shade <b>and</b> <b>detail</b> {{with a variety of}} brushes. For some textured surfaces, such as facial hair and woodgrain, he used a broad brush with bristles as sparse as a comb. He employed all the finest workshop methods and best innovations, combining them with a diversity of brushwork and breadth of skill far exceeding that of the meticulous Ghirlandaio.|$|E
5|$|Part II {{starts at}} chapter 245 and is set {{two and a}} half years after the {{conclusion}} of chapter 238 in Part I. Chapters 239 through 244 form a gaiden set before the Naruto manga <b>and</b> <b>detail</b> part of Kakashi Hatake's history. All subsequent chapters are considered to be part of the Part II storyline. Naruto is published in individual chapters by Shueisha in Weekly Shōnen Jump and is later collected in tankōbon format with various extras. While the series started serialization in issue 43 of 1999, Part II started in issue 19 of 2005. Volume 28, the first volume of Part II, was released on June 3, 2005, while volume 48 was released on November 4, 2009.|$|E

5|$|The Flood {{have been}} {{featured}} in four series of Halo action figures, produced by Joyride Studios. For Halo: Combat Evolved, Joyride produced a Carrier Form and Infection form bundle. Halo2s series contains both a human Combat Form and Infection form (bundled with the Master Chief), which were released after the video game. Reviewer Aaron Simmer of Armchair Empire.com expressed the sentiment that Joyride's models could not totally capture the ghoulishness texture <b>and</b> <b>detail</b> of the Flood. The action figures for Halo 3 were produced by McFarlane Toys and although the first series did not feature the Flood, the third series featured a human Combat Form.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of the Vortigaunt has been popular enough to inspire {{the creation of a}} Vortigaunt plush toy. The toy was designed by Dhabih Eng and was sold and distributed via Valve's online store. The toy was released in December 2006 and due to the proximity to Christmas, the Vortigaunt was accompanied by a to-scale Santa Claus hat. Reviews of the plush toy were favorable, praising the toy as sturdy, as well as giving credit for its articulation <b>and</b> <b>detail.</b>|$|E
5|$|The game {{used the}} Infinity Engine, a game engine {{initially}} developed by BioWare for Baldur's Gate. However, Planescape: Torment was being developed using the Infinity Engine before Baldur's Gate had been released, leaving the engine's acceptance {{in the market}} still unknown. Black Isle made modifications to the engine to suit the game. For example, playable characters were able to run, and both the character sprites and backgrounds were larger and more detailed. The greater size <b>and</b> <b>detail</b> was achieved by bringing the perspective closer to the ground. Magic was also {{an important part of}} the game's design, and a team of four designers worked solely on the visuals and mechanics of spells.|$|E
