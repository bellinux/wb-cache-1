25|$|The lantern room is the glassed-in housing {{at the top}} of a {{lighthouse}} tower containing the lamp and lens. Its glass storm panes are supported by metal <b>Astragal</b> bars running vertically or diagonally. At the top of the lantern room is a stormproof ventilator designed to remove the smoke of the lamps and the heat that builds in the glass enclosure. A lightning rod and grounding system connected to the metal cupola roof provides a safe conduit for any lightning strikes.|$|E

5000|$|The word [...] "astragal" [...] {{comes from}} the Greek and Latin for [...] "vertebra," [...] and the {{original}} <b>astragals</b> used in architecture were made in a beaded design, thereby resembling a vertebra.|$|R
50|$|Extending onto both front verandahs is a bay window. Verandah {{balustrading}} is cast-iron, and poles with <b>astragals</b> {{support the}} brokenback verandah roof. Short balustraded steps {{lead to the}} central front door which has glass sidelights. Another front door gives access to the central hallway which has two rooms on either side. The two front bay window rooms are smaller {{than the other two}} rooms.|$|R
50|$|The {{courthouse}} is a two-story, 5-by-8-bay rectangular gable-roofed frame building, with clapboard siding on {{the north}} and south sides and horizontal planks on its west (front) facade. The pedimented gable is supported by the four Corinthian columns, behind which is the main entrance, with molded classical detail. Similar ornamentation {{can be found on the}} window lintels. The two front corners have large pilasters; the original stone plinth blocks have been replaced with concrete copies and the <b>astragals</b> taken down to help prevent dry rot in the columns.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the three}} orders of ancient Greek architecture, the sculptural decoration, be it a simple half round <b>astragal,</b> a frieze of stylised foliage or the ornate {{sculpture}} of the pediment, is all {{essential to the}} architecture {{of which it is}} a part. In the Doric order, there is no variation in its placement. Reliefs never decorate walls in an arbitrary way. The sculpture is always located in several predetermined areas, the metopes and the pediment. In later Ionic architecture, there is greater diversity in the types and numbers of mouldings and decorations, particularly around doorways, where voluted brackets sometimes occur supporting an ornamental cornice over a door, such as that at the Erechtheion. A much applied narrow moulding is called [...] "bead and reel" [...] and is symmetrical, stemming from turned wooden prototypes. Wider mouldings include one with tongue-like or pointed leaf shapes, which are grooved and sometimes turned upward at the tip, and [...] "egg and dart" [...] moulding which alternates ovoid shapes with narrow pointy ones.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{greatest}} alterations to the form of Rideau Hall came in 1913, {{with the construction of}} the Mappin Block as a link between the ballroom and Tent Room, along with a re-facing of the two latter structures to harmonise their windows, cornice heights, and cladding (in a limestone ashlar), all in an [...] "adapted Florentine architectural style" [...] designed by Chief Dominion Architect David Ewart. The block is three storeys in height, and its front is divided by pilasters into five bays, with the central one slightly wider than the equal other four. The windows on the main floor are each surrounded by smaller pilasters beneath a triangular pediment formed by keel moulding geisons, while the second level windows are each simply framed by <b>astragal</b> moulding broken at the top by a keystone. A heavy entablature separates the second and third levels, atop which sits less pronounced pilasters and simply framed windows, with the entire facade capped by a narrow cornice and a pediment with a tympanum that bears a bas relief of the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom (believed to be the largest rendition in the Commonwealth). For formal arrivals at the main door, later called the Queen's Entrance, this addition also included a porte-cochère with three arched openings, the centre one topped with a carved stone rendition of the shield of the Royal Arms of Canada as it appeared between 1868 and 1921. All the arches can be fitted during the winter with fanlights and glass doors to provide an enclosed space in which to exit cars. Further projects that were completed by 1914 were the addition in 1912 of the Long Gallery to the east of the Tent Room, and the enlargement of the State Dining Room.|$|E
50|$|Three bronze astragals, one by Nikolaus Geiger and two by George Brewster, {{surround}} the stone obelisk. The first <b>astragal</b> is placed 70 ft above the obelisk's base. The second <b>astragal</b> is 12 ft above the first. The third <b>astragal</b> is 80 ft above the base, below the capital. Geiger, of Berlin, Germany, cast and shipped the first <b>astragal,</b> a battlefield {{scene of the}} army, from Germany. He never saw the monument at Indianapolis and died before its completion. Brewster, an American sculptor from Cleveland, Ohio, created the second <b>astragal</b> with a naval theme that includes a portrait relief of Admiral David Farragut. Brewster also designed the third <b>astragal</b> with the dates 1861 and 1865, the Civil War’s beginning and ending dates.|$|E
5000|$|Older {{buildings}} have generally a rough shape, a limited decoration with a mixing of styles ( [...] eclecticism), {{characteristic of the}} second half of the 19th century. Facades are generally horizontally by cornices, especially on the top of buildings. They are often decorated with classical ornaments such as: <b>astragals,</b> cymatia, meanders, palmette friezes and triglyphes. Vertical façade articulations are realized through columns, pillars and pilasters. Some houses are adorned with pediments including tondi or allegorical statues.Columns and pilasters also appear in window frames and door openings, usually topped by a frontage and more rarely with decorated friezes.|$|R
50|$|The {{memorial}} {{includes several}} notable outdoor sculptures, including Rudolph Schwarz's two massive limestone groupings of War and Peace, two smaller scenes named The Dying Soldier and The Return Home, and four military figures at its base. Three <b>astragals,</b> one by Nikolaus (Nicolaus) Geiger {{and two others}} by George T. Brewster, surround the stone obelisk. Additional sculptures include John H. Mahoney's bronze statues of George Rogers Clark, William Henry Harrison, and James Whitcomb, and Franklin Simmons's bronze statue of Oliver P. Morton. Brewster's 30 ft bronze statue of Victory crowns the obelisk. The Indianapolis monument is approximately 15 ft shorter than New York City's 305 ft Statue of Liberty.|$|R
50|$|The {{verandah}} edges rest on 25 cm high {{brick walls}} and are capped with painted timber boards. The posts {{are divided into}} two parts by stop chamfering, and have <b>astragals,</b> capitals and carved timber brackets. On the east-facing edge, a low timber seat fits between each post and forms a simple balustrade. The verandah area's floor is clad in narrow shot-edge timber boards and is approximately 3m wide. The exposed underside of its curved roof is not supported by rafters, except where a hip occurs, such as where the barrel-roofed entry porch intersects with it. The verandah area looking north is partially enclosed by timber framing that supports some fixed glass, a sliding glass door and a low weatherboard-clad balustrade. All timberwork, except that lining the floor, is painted.|$|R
50|$|An <b>astragal</b> is a {{moulding}} profile {{composed of}} a half-round surface surrounded by two flat planes (fillets). An <b>astragal</b> is {{sometimes referred to as}} a miniature torus. It can be an architectural element used at the top or base of a column, but is also employed as a framing device on furniture and woodwork.|$|E

5000|$|The light sits on {{a square}} {{reinforced}} concrete pier, 30 ft high and 64 ft on a side. [...] Atop the pier is a two-story base, 15 ft high and 30 ft on a side. [...] The cellar and first floor in the base were built to house diesel generators, boilers, and compressors to provide power and heat to the light, fog signal, and keeper's quarters. [...] The {{second floor of the}} base housed the keeper's quarters. The lighthouse tower is placed {{in the center of the}} building roof. The tower is 17 ft tall, and tapers from 16 ft at the base to 10 ft beneath the gallery. The entire light is covered on the exterior with steel plates. [...] The lantern atop the tower has helical <b>astragals,</b> and housed a red 3-1/2 order Fresnel lens.|$|R
5000|$|Though much altered, {{this is one}} of Scotland's most {{beautiful}} ancient churches. According to Crail Parish Church's website (see external link below) in its first form the church building consisted of an unaisled rectangular nave and chancel of romanesque design. In the early 13th century a fine western tower with small spire was added, and a double arcade of round pillars of variegated red sandstone in the nave. It was in this form in 1243 that the church was dedicated to St Maelrubha by the Bishop of St Andrews. (In later times it was known as St Mary's probably after a later dedication in a later period that disliked vestiges of the Celtic Church.) The side walls were rebuilt in Regency times, and the large pointed windows, filled with panes of clear glass held by <b>astragals</b> rather than leads, allow light to flood into the interior. The unaisled chancel, now housing a huge organ, has been shortened. The church retains some 17th-century woodwork. The early Christian cross-slab mentioned at the start of this article is on display in the church: it is of unusual form (perhaps 10th century), formerly set in the floor. The church building is open on some afternoons in the summer.|$|R
50|$|The large main {{entrance}} doorways are generally round arch openings symmetrically placed in gable ends and often flanking a smaller central window. Long side window and door openings are generally of the segmental arch headed type with multi-pane windows in carefully detailed cast iron frames, <b>astragals,</b> and pivoting sections. Door and window dressings are {{a combination of}} Helidon freestone, brickwork, or cement render usually with restrained use of coloured brick or stone voussoirs and keystones, raking arches and label moulds.In {{the early years of}} the twentieth century, well designed and finely detailed industrial brick structures such as the Power House, Erecting and Boiler Shops were constructed, completing the intended lateral expansion along the northern and southern sides of the Traverser. These buildings continued the style of the 1880s buildings, some with affinities to Romanesque detail. The final result, when viewed along the strong central axis of the Traverser, is a streetscape of robust brick industrial buildings. Each facade exhibits subtle variations on a simple architectural theme, and although the roof lines vary from simple pitched roofs to extensive saw tooth profiles, there is a great subtlety of scale and material texture which is aesthetically pleasing and impressive.The influence of quality engineering practice, upon the designs for the North Ipswich Railway Workshops is clearly evident in the drawings and specifications produced at this time.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>astragal</b> is {{commonly}} used to seal between a pair of doors. The <b>astragal</b> closes the clearance gap created by bevels on one or both mating doors, and helps deaden sound. The vertical member (molding) attaches to a stile on one {{of a pair of}} either sliding or swinging doors, against which the other door seals when closed. Exterior astragals are kerfed for weatherstripping.|$|E

5000|$|Phrygillus, was {{an ancient}} Greek artist, {{who appears to}} {{have been one of the}} most ancient, as well as one of the most celebrated medallists and {{engravers}} of precious stones. There is a very beautiful intaglio by him, representing Love seated and supporting himself on the ground, in the attitude of those figures of boys playing the game of <b>astragals,</b> which so often occurs in the works of ancient art. The form of the letters of the name ΦΡVΓΙΛΛ, the large size of the wings of the figure of Love, and the whole style of the gem, concur to show that the artist belonged to the earlier Greek school. There is also engraved upon this gem a bivalve shell, which also occurs on the coins of Syracuse whence it may be inferred that the artist was a Syracusan. This conjecture becomes a certainty through the fact, recently published by Raoul-Rochette, that there exist medals of Syracuse, on which the name of Phrygillus is inscribed. One medal of this type is in the possession of R. Rochette himself, who has given an engraving of it on the title-page of his Lettre a M. Schorn, by the side of an engraving of the gem already mentioned. Another medal of this type is in the collection of the Due de Luynes. The same collection contains another very beautiful Syracusan medal, in bronze, bearing the inscription ΦΡΥ, which no one can now hesitate to recognise as the initial letters of the name Phrygillus. Raoul-Rochette accounts these three medals to be among the most precious remains of ancient numismatic art.|$|R
