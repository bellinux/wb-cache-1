50|$|King {{served as}} a {{professor}} of <b>agricultural</b> <b>physics</b> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison from 1888 until 1902. Interested {{in a wide range of}} subjects throughout his career, King made major contributions during these years in research and teaching that dealt with applications of physics to agriculture. Most attention was given to soil physics, for example, water-holding capacities of soils, moisture requirements of plants, aeration, movement of water in soils, movement of groundwater, the drafts of plows, and the lifting power of windmills; he also began studies of soil fertility. The impact of his career was greatest in the field of soil science. He has been called the father of soil physics in the United States.|$|E
50|$|He is most {{popularly known}} for {{designing}} the cylindrical storage silo, which reduces {{the occurrence of}} moldy corners in the grain. Some have speculated that Frank Lloyd Wright's design of the Guggenheim Museum was influenced by King's designs. King is commemorated at the University of Wisconsin-Madison by King Hall, so renamed in 1934, {{which is the same}} <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Physics</b> Hall in which he worked during his tenure there and which now houses part of the Department of Soil Science (formed by the 1904 reorganization of King's original department into the 'Soils Department' and the 'Agricultural Engineering Department'), and by the F.H. King Students for Sustainable Agriculture, a student organization that grows various crops that are given away to community residents to raise awareness of sustainable farming and gardening.|$|E
5000|$|King {{returned}} to Madison, where he devoted {{the last seven}} years of his life to summarizing earlier findings and conducting further research in <b>agricultural</b> <b>physics,</b> including the ventilation of farm buildings. Three of his seven books were written during that period, the best known of which is Farmers of Forty Centuries, or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea, and Japan, which recounted his investigations into what would now be called organic farming or sustainable agriculture during a nine-month tour of Asia in 1909. The last chapter was completed after his death by his wife, Carrie Baker King. The book was published in 1911 and was described by Lord Northbourne - the founder of organic agriculture - as a [...] "classic" [...] which [...] "no student of farming or social science can afford to ignore".|$|E

40|$|The {{quality and}} {{quantity}} of research publications are used as benchmarks to monitor the performance of South Africa's national system of innovation. The indicators are pertinent to the policies of the Department of Education, which distributes funds for research at institutions of higher education by measuring the volume of research outputs. In this article, we present a scientometric assessment of research in South Africa {{in the context of the}} rest of Africa and in comparison with Brazil and India - two countries with which South Africa aims to develop strong scientific ties. We find that South Africa has published a significant number of papers in all 22 disciplines represented in the ISI's Essential Science Indicators. The largest numbers of journal articles in a 10 -year period (1996 - 2005) were published in the categories Clinical Medicine, and in Plant and Animal Sciences, with over 7000 papers each. Three groupings, namely, Chemistry, Geosciences, and Environmental / Ecology, form the second cluster of disciplines in terms of the highest number of publications (2966, 2488 and 2386, respectively). In all 22 subject categories, India and Brazil are rated higher than South Africa in terms of number of publications, but South Africa is ranked above these countries in relation to citations per paper in all disciplines. Egypt outranked South Africa in three disciplines in the period 1995 - 2004, namely, Chemistry, Engineering, and Materials Science, as did Nigeria in Agriculture in 1996 - 2005. In addition to the three disciplines in the earlier period, Egypt outranked South Africa in 1996 - 2005 in <b>Physics,</b> <b>Agricultural</b> Sciences, and Pharmacology / Toxicology. However, South Africa scored higher than both African countries in all disciplines in terms of citations per paper...|$|R
500|$|When it was founded, {{the school}} was {{considered}} an experiment. Its goal was [...] "to open an independent means of livelihood for young men and women, especially of our cities; to demonstrate that higher values may be obtained from land under intelligent management, {{and to develop a}} taste for rural life." [...] Most students were trained in garden and farm operations in a two-year course, with short summer courses in nature study also offered. The academic year had three terms, with twelve weeks of vacation. Although the school allowed new students to begin at any term, a September start was considered the most desirable. Instruction was offered in agriculture, horticulture, cold storage, botany, chemistry, geology, <b>physics,</b> <b>agricultural</b> zoology, entomology, beekeeping, meteorology, land surveying and leveling, soils, drainage, irrigation, tillage, fertilizers, plant diseases, stock, fruit growing, landscape gardening and bookkeeping. It was a practical school, with no attempt to provide a general education. Work included caring for orchard trees and bush fruit, greenhouse culture of fruits and vegetables, jelly- and jam-making, market gardening, tillage, fertilizer use, hybridizing and propagating flowers, harvesting and marketing crops. The school used Briarcliff Farms, where students worked the land, tested milk and cared for a variety of animals. Students also raised flowers, vegetables and fruit, and accompanied their products to cities for marketing. The New York Botanical Garden arranged with the school for student access to its lectures, museums and conservatories. Tuition was $100 a year ($ in [...] ), and board $280 a year ($ in [...] ). Instruction was primarily weekday-morning lectures with laboratory work; during the afternoon, students worked on the school farm (which had a foreman, gardener and several workmen to ensure continuous operation) under instructor supervision. In 1901 35 students attended, followed by 34 in 1902 (almost all from cities), ranging in age from 16 to 35. Most had a high-school education before enrolling, and some had been to college.

40|$|The GAW DACH {{project is}} a joint {{cooperation}} between the German, Austrian and Swiss (D-A-CH) Meteorological Agencies DWD, ZAMG and SMI. Further project partners were the German Federal Environment Agency, the Austrian Federal Environment Agency, the Institute for Analytical Chemistry (University Vienna), the Institute for Meteorology and <b>Physics</b> (<b>Agricultural</b> University Vienna), and the Swiss Federal Laboratory for Materials Testing and Research (EMPA). The DACH project aims at coordinating the national monitoring activities within the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) program of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) by supplementing the monitoring program at the German global station Zugspitze/Hohenpeissenberg with measurements at Jungfraujoch (Switzerland) and Sonnblick (Austria). In particular, the main objectives of this cooperation are - to guarantee comparability of the data through quality control and use of common standards, - to build a common data base, - to investigate the spatial representativess of the data, - to develop filters for extracting data with extended spatial representativeness from the dataset. An important goal of GAW is the early detection of large scale changes in the atmosphere. Filter functions which point out concentration fluctuations caused by local meteorological and chemical processes {{are expected to be}} an important tool for detecting those trends earlier and more reliably. Such a trend analysis can be improved and made more representative in space by combining data from the three stations. Continental monitoring sites in complex terrain affected by relatively close highly populated and industrialized regions should basically cooperate for a representative picture of the area. The report summarizes results from {{the first three years of}} this cooperation. A short station description is followed by a climatological characterization through annual average wind direction and speed, as well as box plots of average annual variation of temperature, carbon monoxide, ozone and nitrogen oxides, including information on the concentration range of these trace substances. The stations are further characterized by back trajectory climatologies. The actual and intended monitoring program at the participating stations with respect to the needs for GAW is listed in a comprehensive table. (orig.)

5000|$|During {{the winter}} of 1895-96, the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor {{researched}} the causes of youth moving from the country to cities to develop the most efficient method of attracting {{them back to the}} country. That, and an examination of agricultural needs for a year, resulted in meetings at the homes of Abram S. Hewitt and R. Fulton Cutting and the formation of the New York State Committee for the Promotion of Agriculture. The committee, chaired by Hewitt, included Cutting, Jacob H. Schiff, John G. Carlisle, Mrs. Seth Low, Josephine Shaw Lowell, Walter Law and William E. Dodge. Its board of trustees had five officers (with Theodore L. Van Norden president) and seventeen other trustees, including Law, V. Everit Macy and James Speyer. George T. Powell, a [...] "recognized authority on scientific agriculture" [...] according to The New York Times, was consulted; he later organized the school and became its director. When Walter Law was included the school took shape, since he provided its land and building. In September 1900, Law and the committee established the School of Practical Agriculture and Horticulture as part of Briarcliff Farms, on an elevated 66 acre site about midway between the Briarcliff Manor and Pleasantville train stations on Pleasantville Road. Law leased the 66 acres (which were worth $1,000 ($ in [...] ) an acre) for 20 years at the rate of a dollar per year, gave the trustees $30,000 ($ in [...] ) to build a dormitory and promised them $3,000 ($ in [...] ) a year for expenses until the school earned a profit. With that and $30,000 from the trustees, the school opened; the committee focused the curriculum on horticulture, floriculture, gardening and aviculture.
