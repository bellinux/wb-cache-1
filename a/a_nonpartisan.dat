5|$|Briarcliff Manor {{maintains}} a voting custom that dates {{to at least}} around 1905.

The system of the People's Caucus is largely unique to the village, and {{has been described as}} an extension of the New England town hall concept. The People's Caucus, officially formed in 1946, chooses candidates by majority vote two months before the village election, where the candidates usually run unopposed, turning the election into a formality. The caucus is open to citizens of 18 years or over who have lived in the village for at least a month; voter registration is not required. Voters and candidates do not declare party affiliations, instead candidates present their platforms in early January of each year, and weeks later the caucus meets again to vote.|$|E

5|$|Each {{county is}} run by a commissioners' court, {{consisting}} of four elected commissioners (one from each of four precincts drawn based on population) and a county judge elected from all the voters of the county. In smaller counties, the county judge actually does perform judicial duties, but in larger counties, the judge's role is limited to serving on the commissioners' court. Certain officials, such as the sheriff and tax collector, are elected separately by the voters, but the commissioners' court determines their office budgets, and sets overall county policy. All county elections are partisan; the one exception is the board of trustees of the Dallas County department of education (the Harris County trustees were elected on <b>a</b> <b>nonpartisan</b> basis until 1984).|$|E
5|$|In the 1912 presidential election, Lane {{supported}} Democratic {{candidate and}} New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, though {{he declined to}} make campaign speeches on Wilson's behalf, citing ICC policy that commissioners act in <b>a</b> <b>nonpartisan</b> manner. Wilson was elected on November 5, 1912, and on November 21 the commissioner {{spent much of the}} day with Colonel Edward M. House, the President-elect's advisor, who would {{play a key role in}} selecting Cabinet appointees. The possibility of Lane becoming Secretary of the Interior was discussed, but he indicated he was happy in his present position. After the meeting, Lane had second thoughts, and asked House if he would have a free hand as Interior Secretary. House indicated that were he to prove capable in the position, Wilson would not interfere. Colonel House did not immediately recommend Lane for the job, but went on to consider other candidates, such as former San Francisco mayor James D. Phelan and Wilson friend Walter Page.|$|E

5|$|With Goebel dead, {{tensions}} {{began to}} ease. The idea of Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, as governor was more palatable {{to much of}} the opposition than civil war in the state, though many of them may have preferred war to a Goebel governorship. After a lengthy meeting, a bipartisan compromise was drafted which would have ended the matter. The terms called for Republican recognition of Goebel's rightful election (and Beckham's subsequent right to govern). Republicans would also remove the militia from Frankfort. Democrats would, in turn, extend immunity to any Republican official found to have ties to the assassination, stop contesting elections for other state offices, and work to pass <b>a</b> <b>nonpartisan</b> election reform bill. The agreement needed only Taylor's signature to become effective. Unwilling to relinquish his office, Taylor balked.|$|E
5|$|Ryan's budget plans {{proposed}} privatizing Medicare {{for those}} {{under the age}} of 55, and funding Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through block grants to the states. In 2012 Ryan proposed that Medicaid be converted into block grants, but with the federal government's share of the cost cut by some $800 billion over the next decade. Currently, Medicaid is administered by the states, subject to federal rules concerning eligibility, and the amount paid by the federal government depends on {{the number of people who}} qualify. His plan would have undone a Reagan-era reform by which the federal government prohibited the states from requiring that a patient's spouse, as well as the patient, deplete all of his or her assets before Medicaid would cover long-term care. Ryan’s budget plan proposed raising the Medicare eligibility age, beginning in 2023, by two months a year, until it reached 67 in 2034. A 2011 analysis, conducted by the Urban Institute, <b>a</b> <b>nonpartisan</b> research group, for the Kaiser Family Foundation, estimated that Ryan's 2011 plan would have resulted in 14 million to 27 million fewer people receiving Medicaid coverage by 2021.|$|E
5|$|Teaneck {{is governed}} within the Faulkner Act (formally {{known as the}} Optional Municipal Charter Law) under the Council-Manager form of {{government}} (Plan 12), implemented by direct petition as of July 1, 1988. Following its founding in 1895, Teaneck used the traditional township form of government, led by a three-member Township Committee (later expanded to five seats) elected on a partisan basis. On September 16, 1930, Teaneck residents voted to establish <b>a</b> <b>nonpartisan</b> Council-Manager form of government {{under the terms of}} the 1923 Municipal Manager Law, with five members elected concurrently on an at-large basis. In 1962, the Council expanded to its current size of seven members and the position of Deputy Mayor was created. In 1987, a referendum to alter the form to a Faulkner Act Council-Manager form of government was approved, providing for staggered terms for the Council. With this change, Council elections now take place in even years on the second Tuesday in May. The Council's seven members are elected at-large in nonpartisan elections to serve staggered, four-year terms of office. The four seats elected in 2010 will expire in 2014 and the seats of the three who took office in 2012 will expire in 2016, etc.|$|E
