5|$|This {{view was}} {{the norm for}} some time after Boece and is {{reflected}} in the Statistical Accounts for Aberlemno. It took until the mid-19th century for it to be pointed out that not only was there no evidence that the stones were Scandinavian in origin, there was also <b>ample</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the stones were Pictish/Scottish in origin. The kirkyard stone predates the Battle of Barry by three centuries and the most widely accepted interpretation is that the stone commemorates the Pictish victory at the historical Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 AD.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's {{theory has}} {{important}} astrophysical implications. For example, it implies {{the existence of}} black holes—regions of space in which space and time are distorted {{in such a way}} that nothing, not even light, can escape—as an end-state for massive stars. There is <b>ample</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes; for example, microquasars and active galactic nuclei result from the presence of stellar black holes and supermassive black holes, respectively. The bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky. General relativity also predicts the existence of gravitational waves, which have since been observed directly by physics collaboration LIGO. In addition, general relativity is the basis of current cosmological models of a consistently expanding universe.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{policies}} and practices which resulted in individuals being punished for peacefully exercising their human rights by sending them to RTL have not fundamentally changed: quite the contrary. There is <b>ample</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> such policies and practices are continuing in full force. The latest anti-Falun Gong campaign, launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years, shows that the CCP’s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated. Falun Gong practitioners continue to be punished through criminal prosecution and being sent to “brainwashing centres” {{and other forms of}} arbitrary detention. Petitioners likewise continue to be subjected to harassment, forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to “black jails” and other forms of arbitrary detention. Human rights defenders, democracy advocates, whistle-blowers and other political activists are also being increasingly targeted through criminal detention, “black jails”, short-term administrative detention, and enforced disappearances, rather than RTL.|$|E

The upper portion of the second embryonic arch supporting the gill became the hyomandibular bone of jawed fishes, which supports the skull and therefore links the jaw to the cranium.|$|R

25|$|Author Martin Bollinger {{reports that}} during the ship's Soviet career there is <b>ample</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Dzhurma was used on Gulag routes between 1936 and 1950.

Travel time to Magadan was about 6 to 14 days; trips to the Arctic were seasonal as during the winter the sea froze over. A steamer would make about ten trips a year. Conditions were horrendous, and many people did not survive the trip.|$|E

25|$|The great Library of Alexandria {{was later}} burned. There {{is a growing}} {{consensus}} among historians that the Library of Alexandria likely suffered from several destructive events, but that the destruction of Alexandria's pagan temples in the late 4th century {{was probably the most}} severe and final one. The evidence for that destruction is the most definitive and secure. Caesar's invasion may well have led to the loss of some 40,000-70,000 scrolls in a warehouse adjacent to the port (as Luciano Canfora argues, they were likely copies produced by the Library intended for export), but it is unlikely to have affected the Library or Museum, given that there is <b>ample</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> both existed later.|$|E
25|$|In the Tiberian masoretic codices, {{the unique}} system of cantillation for Sifrei Emet is complemented by a scribal layout {{unlike that of}} the rest of the Bible: Instead of the three narrow columns per page typical of these codices, Sifrei Emet are written in two wide columns per page. In each line of these wide columns text begins on the right, {{followed}} by a gap, and then continued by further text until the left margin of the column. Although there is <b>ample</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the scribes attempted to place the gaps in the middle of the lines at the points where the cantillation divides the verses, they often did not succeed in doing so because of space limitations. Modern editions based upon the Aleppo Codex have implemented the idea fully by allowing wide full-page columns for Psalms, Proverbs, and Job.|$|E
25|$|Climate {{change could}} have {{significant}} impacts on water resources {{around the world}} because of the close connections between the climate and hydrological cycle. Rising temperatures will increase evaporation and lead to increases in precipitation, though there will be regional variations in rainfall. Both droughts and floods may become more frequent in different regions at different times, and dramatic changes in snowfall and snow melt are expected in mountainous areas. Higher temperatures will also affect water quality {{in ways that are}} not well understood. Possible impacts include increased eutrophication. Climate change could also mean an increase in demand for farm irrigation, garden sprinklers, and perhaps even swimming pools. There is now <b>ample</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> increased hydrologic variability and change in climate has and will continue have a profound impact on the water sector through the hydrologic cycle, water availability, water demand, and water allocation at the global, regional, basin, and local levels.|$|E

500|$|On the {{sheltered}} {{slopes of}} the highest peaks of Glacier National Park in Montana, the eponymous glaciers are diminishing rapidly. The area of each glacier has been mapped for decades by the National Park Service and the U.S. Geological Survey. Comparing photographs from the mid-19th century with contemporary images provides <b>ample</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> they have retreated notably since 1850. Repeat photography since clearly show that glaciers such as Grinnell Glacier are all retreating. The larger glaciers are now approximately {{a third of their}} former size when first studied in 1850, and numerous smaller glaciers have disappeared completely. Only 27% of the [...] area of Glacier National Park covered by glaciers in 1850 remained covered by 1993. Researchers believe that by the year 2030, the vast majority of glacial ice in Glacier National Park will be gone unless current climate patterns reverse their course. Grinnell Glacier {{is just one of many}} glaciers in Glacier National Park that have been well documented by photographs for many decades. The photographs below clearly demonstrate the retreat of this glacier since 1938.|$|E

50|$|The Siege of Calcutta was {{a battle}} between the British East India Company, and Siraj ud-Daulah, the Nawab of Bengal in India.
