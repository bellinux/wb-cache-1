5|$|Some {{claim that}} the FVdG {{influenced}} strikes in the <b>arms</b> <b>industry</b> as early as February or March 1918, but the organization was not re-established {{on a national level}} until December 1918. On December 14, Fritz Kater started publishing Der Syndikalist (The Syndicalist) in Berlin as a replacement for Die Einigkeit. On December 26 and 27, a conference organized by Kater and attended by 33 delegates from 43 local unions took place in Berlin. The delegates reflected upon the difficult times during the war and proudly noted that the FVdG was the only trade union which did not have to adjust its program to the new political conditions because it had remained loyal to its anti-state and internationalist principles. The delegates reaffirmed their rejection of parliamentarianism and refused to participate in the National Assembly.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis analyzes key variables and processes in France, the United Kingdom, and the Federal Republic of Germany {{in an attempt}} to determine the factors unique to each nation that tend to inhibit or promote movement toward integration of the European <b>arms</b> <b>industries.</b> For {{the purposes of this study}} it is assumed that defense production costs will be constantly increasing, while a variety of other global factors continue to produce a smaller arms market and increased competition among suppliers. With these factors known, the political, military, and economic roles of national <b>arms</b> <b>industries</b> are isolated as potential indicators of future integration in Europe and the significance of a joint venture involving any of these nations may be judged with greater confidence.

25|$|The {{mobilisation}} {{of women}} in the war economy always remained limited: the number of women practising a professional activity in 1944 was virtually unchanged from 1939, being about 15million women, in contrast to Great Britain, so that the use of women did not progress and only 1,200,000 of them worked in the <b>arms</b> <b>industry</b> in 1943, in working conditions that were difficult and often poorly treated by their bosses, who deplored their lack of qualification.|$|E

40|$|Weapons {{programs}} are criticized for cost overruns, delays in delivery {{and failure to}} meet their operational requirements. Critics focus on the power and influence of the military-industrial-political complex. This chapter addresses these controversial areas involving <b>arms</b> <b>industries,</b> alternative procurement policies and industrial policy. <b>Arms</b> <b>industries</b> are defined and statistics are presented on the world's <b>arms</b> <b>industries.</b> They can be analyzed as economically strategic industries where both R&D and production quantities are important and lead to decreasing cost industries reflecting economies of scale and learning. A structure-conduct-performance approach is applied. Market conduct is assessed including defense R&D {{and the role of}} the military-industrial-political complex. Market performance is reviewed by assessing contract performance, firm productivity and profitability and exports. Governments are central to understanding arms markets and weapons procurement raises both theory and policy issues. There are principal-agent problems and issues of adverse selection, moral hazard, risk sharing and bilateral monopoly. Various types of contract are available, each with different efficiency incentives. Governments can also use their buying power to determine the size, structure and performance of a nation's defense industrial base (DIB). The benefits and costs of a national DIB are assessed and three policy issues and challenges are reviewed. These are the role of competition in arms procurement, its extension to military outsourcing and the profitability of non-competitive contracts. Alternative industrial policies are a further aspect of procurement policy. Guidelines for a defense industrial policy in a military alliance are outlined together with an assessment of European collaborative programs. The Chapter concludes by speculating on the future of the defense firm and proposing an agenda for future research in the field. Defense in a Globalized World...|$|R

25|$|Soviet Ukraine {{soon became}} a European leader in {{industrial}} production, and an important centre of the Soviet <b>arms</b> <b>industry</b> and high-tech research. Such an important role resulted in a major influence of the local elite. Many members of the Soviet leadership came from Ukraine, most notably Leonid Brezhnev. He later ousted Khrushchev and became the Soviet leader from 1964 to 1982. Many prominent Soviet sports players, scientists, and artists came from Ukraine.|$|E

50|$|The Partisans fought an {{increasingly}} successful guerrilla {{campaign against the}} Axis occupiers and their local collaborators, including the Chetniks (which they also considered collaborators).

People's committees were organized to act as civilian governments in areas of the country liberated by the Partisans. In places, even limited <b>arms</b> <b>industries</b> were set up.|$|R
