5|$|Baleen whales have a small, yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> down other whales. They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell {{due to the lack of}} the olfactory bulb, but they do have an olfactory tract. Baleen whales have few if any taste buds, suggesting they have lost their sense of taste. They do retain salt-receptor taste-buds suggesting that they can taste saltiness.|$|E

5|$|Locating prey: The wolves {{travel in}} search of prey through their power of scent, chance encounter, <b>and</b> <b>tracking.</b> Wolves {{typically}} locate their prey by scent, though they must usually be directly downwind of it. When a breeze carrying the prey's scent is located, the wolves stand alert, and point their eyes, ears and nose towards their target. In open areas, wolves may precede the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, the wolves head towards their prey.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{power is}} the {{conversion}} of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination.

5|$|By late on September15, the {{hurricane}} {{was beginning to}} affect the North Carolina coastline. The high winds near the center prompted the United States Weather Bureau to issue storm warnings {{on the morning of}} September16 into the next day. Turning northward, {{the hurricane}} weakened slightly and made landfall near Atlantic City, New Jersey, shortly before 12:00UTC on September16. The estimated barometric pressure was , suggesting hurricane-force winds of 80mph (130km/h) at landfall. This made it the first and only known hurricane to strike New Jersey since the Atlantic hurricane database's beginning in 1851. The storm structure broadened after landfall, and the Weather Bureau assessed one center splitting off <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> north-northeastward into New York and Connecticut. The main center continued northwestward, weakening into a tropical storm near Trenton, New Jersey. After crossing northeastern Pennsylvania, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near Syracuse, New York on September17. The extratropical remnant persisted for another six hours before losing its identity over eastern Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> {{systems to}} focus {{a large area}} of {{sunlight}} into a small beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.|$|E

If this functionality is not enabled, Cortana operates in a feature-limited mode with basic web and device search functionality, nearly identical to the non-Cortana search experience on previous builds.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Bola {{was one of}} the costliest {{cyclones}} in {{the history}} of New Zealand, causing severe damage as an extratropical cyclone when it passed near the country in March 1988. It formed on February 24 to the north of Fiji, <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> generally southwestward it reached hurricane-force winds near Vanuatu on February 28. The next day it generated peak wind velocities of 195km/h (120mph), though it quickly weakened as it accelerated southward. On March 4 Bola transitioned into an extratropical storm, passing {{to the north of the}} North Island of New Zealand on March 8. It weakened further and was absorbed by a stationary trough near the South Island on March 12.|$|E

5|$|Robert Fletcher, costume {{designer}} {{for the previous}} Star Trek films, was responsible for The Search for Spocks wardrobe. Fletcher's job was to sketch outfits, choose the necessary fabrics, and complete the fittings for principal characters. He collaborated with costumer Jim Linn, who clothed extras and managed the logistics of cleaning, repairing, <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> costumes. Most of the Starfleet uniforms had already been designed for the previous film, but Fletcher wanted to dress the main characters in civilian clothes. Fletcher developed a mythology behind each outfit; the stone ornaments on Sarek's robe, for instance, were intended to be representative of a Vulcan's level of consciousness. The costumer {{had the advantage of}} access to Paramount's store rooms, which contained literal tons of expensive fabrics.|$|E
5|$|The National Park Service (NPS) {{acquired}} {{the island in}} 1972 and declared it the Cumberland Island National Seashore. Since then, few new horses have been introduced to the island, though four Arabians were introduced in the early 1990s {{in the hopes of}} diversifying and bettering the existing population. Since 1981, the NPS has been monitoring the horses <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> their impact on the environment. In 1991, an outbreak of eastern equine encephalitis killed about 40 horses, or approximately 18% of the herd. The population on Cumberland Island is one of seven feral horse herds on US barrier islands.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of wind shear and low-level helicity produced moderate convection across central Florida {{in association with}} the precursor low pressure system.

The tornado destroyed 20homes, left 30others severely damaged, injured one person, and caused power outages for about 300people. Damage totaled $6.2million (2007USD). Tornadoes were also reported near Marianna and Chipley. The precursor low pressure system also generated lightning that stuck and killed a man in Hendry County, Florida.|$|E
