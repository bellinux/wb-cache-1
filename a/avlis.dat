25|$|The {{unfinished}} hull {{was purchased}} in 1989 by A. Lelakis, owner of Regency Cruises. Regency planned {{to put her}} into service as their first new ship, having previously purchased and converted ocean liners. Stena Baltica was towed to the <b>Avlis</b> Shipyards at Perama, Greece (also owned by Lelakis), where a USD $200million process to convert her into a cruise ship began. The vessel was renamed Regent Sky at this time, and 7,000 tons of steel were installed after she was lengthened 50 meters at Elefsis Shipyards in Greece.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, while Regent Sky {{was at the}} <b>Avlis</b> Shipyards of Chalkis, Greece {{and about}} 60% finished, Regency Cruises ceased operations. The vessel was seized by the National Bank of Greece and Hellenic Industrial Development Bank in July 1999. Since then, Regent Sky has moved from one lay up berth to another, {{including}} Perama, Ambelakia and then Kinossoura. All attempts to sell the vessel at auction failed. The Regent Sky had been laid up and moved to anchorage off Eleusis, Greece, until July 2011 when she was sold for scrapping. The never finished hulk arrived for demolition in Aliaga, Turkey on 16 July 2012.|$|E
500|$|The gas {{centrifuge}} process, where gaseous uranium hexafluoride (...) is separated by {{the difference in}} molecular weight between 235UF6 and 238UF6 using high-speed centrifuges, is the cheapest and leading enrichment process. The gaseous diffusion process had been the leading method for enrichment and {{was used in the}} Manhattan Project. In this process, uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly diffused through a silver-zinc membrane, and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate (since uranium 238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium-235). The molecular laser isotope separation method employs a laser beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium-235 and fluorine. This leaves uranium-238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium-235 metal to precipitate from the solution. An alternative laser method of enrichment is known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation (<b>AVLIS)</b> and employs visible tunable lasers such as dye lasers. Another method used is liquid thermal diffusion.|$|E
2500|$|In {{this method}} a laser is tuned to a {{wavelength}} which excites only one isotope {{of the material}} and ionizes those atoms preferentially. The resonant absorption of light for an isotope is dependent upon its mass and certain hyperfine interactions between electrons and the nucleus, allowing finely tuned lasers to interact with only one isotope. After the atom is ionized it can {{be removed from the}} sample by applying an electric field. This method is often abbreviated as <b>AVLIS</b> (atomic vapor laser isotope separation). This method has only recently been developed as laser technology has improved, and is currently not used extensively. However, it is a major concern to those in the field of nuclear proliferation because it may be cheaper and more easily hidden than other methods of isotope separation.

5000|$|The {{history of}} <b>AVLIS,</b> as {{recorded}} in the open refereed literature, began in the early-mid 1970s in the former Soviet Union and the United States. [...] In the US, <b>AVLIS</b> research was mainly carried out at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory although some industrial laboratories were early players. Tunable laser development for <b>AVLIS,</b> applicable to uranium, has also been reported from several countries including Australia (1982-1984), France (1984), India (1994), and Japan (1996).|$|E

50|$|The atomic vapor laser isotope {{separation}} (<b>AVLIS)</b> process uses the hyperfine splitting between optical transitions in uranium-235 and uranium-238 to selectively photo-ionize only the uranium-235 atoms and then separate the ionized particles from the non-ionized ones.
