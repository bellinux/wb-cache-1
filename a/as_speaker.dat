5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Fox-North Coalition, Mansfield agreed to act <b>as</b> <b>Speaker</b> of the House of Lords, taking up his post in February 1783. The main item of debate during the Coalition Ministry was the East India Bill, which provoked bitter arguments in both the House of Lords and House of Commons. In an attempt to speed up the process of passing the bill, Mansfield left his position <b>as</b> <b>Speaker</b> to debate directly on 15 December; when this failed to help he returned to the Woolsack the next day. The failure of the bill caused the government to be immediately dismissed, and Mansfield left his position on 23 December 1783.|$|E
5|$|In special {{elections}} held in June 1861, Unionists captured nine of Kentucky's ten congressional {{seats and}} obtained two-thirds majorities {{in both houses}} of the state legislature. Despite Magoffin's strict adherence to the policy of neutrality, the Unionist legislature did not trust him and routinely overrode his vetoes. Unable to provide effective leadership due to a hostile legislature, Magoffin agreed to resign as governor in 1862, provided he could choose his successor. Lieutenant governor Linn Boyd had died in office, and Magoffin refused to allow Speaker of the Senate John F. Fisk to succeed him as governor. Accordingly, Fisk resigned and the Kentucky Senate elected Magoffin's choice, James F. Robinson, <b>as</b> <b>speaker.</b> Magoffin then resigned, Robinson ascended to the governorship, and Fisk was re-elected <b>as</b> <b>Speaker</b> of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Robinson again {{assumed the}} {{position}} <b>as</b> <b>Speaker</b> of the Senate on August 16, 1862 {{as part of}} a political deal to effect the resignation of Governor Beriah Magoffin. Magoffin's lieutenant governor, Linn Boyd, had died in office in 1859, and Magoffin was unwilling to allow John Fisk, then Senate Speaker and next in line for the governorship, to succeed him. Magoffin agreed to resign if the Senate would elect Robinson <b>as</b> <b>Speaker,</b> putting him next in line for the governorship. This was done, and at 10:00am on August 18, 1862, Robinson succeeded Magoffin upon the latter's resignation. Because he never resigned from the Senate, Robinson technically held both his legislative seat and the governorship concurrently.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{men have}} {{resigned}} {{the office of}} governor {{before the end of}} their terms—John J. Crittenden, Beriah Magoffin, John W. Stevenson, Augustus O. Stanley, Happy Chandler, Earle C. Clements, and Wendell H. Ford. Six resigned to accept a higher office: Crittenden was appointed Attorney General of the United States and the other five were elected to the U.S. Senate. Only Beriah Magoffin resigned under duress. A Confederate sympathizer during the Civil War, Magoffin's power was entirely checked by a hostile, pro-Union legislature. With the state's government in gridlock, Magoffin agreed to resign in exchange for being able to name his successor. Lieutenant Governor Linn Boyd had died in office, and the Speaker of the Senate, John F. Fisk, was not acceptable to Magoffin as a successor. Fisk resigned <b>as</b> <b>Speaker,</b> and the Senate elected Magoffin's choice, James Fisher Robinson <b>as</b> <b>Speaker.</b> Magoffin then resigned, Robinson was elevated to governor, and Fisk was re-elected <b>as</b> <b>Speaker</b> of the Senate.|$|E
