5|$|A {{significant}} number of broadside ironclads {{was built in the}} 1860s, principally in Britain and France, but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy, Austria, Russia and the United States. The advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> the rigging did not impede the field of fire.|$|E
5|$|In {{philosophy}} {{the boiling}} frog {{story has been}} used as a way of explaining the sorites paradox. It describes a hypothetical heap of sand from which individual grains are removed one <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> asks if there is a specific point when it can no longer be defined as a heap.|$|E
5|$|The game {{offers a}} large range of enemies and {{different}} stages. It also features online multiplayer modes, such as Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, and Siege (in which the player storms the opponent's base {{and tries to}} destroy the power core inside). It supports up to eight players <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> supports voice chat through a PS2-compatible headset. Internet connection is needed if playing online against other players.|$|E

5|$|The {{mobile phone}} {{version of the}} game is {{primarily}} a beat 'em up with role-playing elements. Unlike the console versions the game plays as a side-scroller in the same vein as the 1992 X-Men arcade game. There are five selectable characters, and players upgrade each through experience points earned. Players control one character <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> can switch to another at the press of a button.|$|E
5|$|The {{winner of}} the main game plays the Bingo Bonus Board, which used two {{different}} formats. In the first season of the show, each number on the Bingo Bonus Board represented a cash amount or another prize, up to a grand prize of $100,000 cash. Every prize was repeated at least twice on the board. The contestant chose one number <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> won the first prize to be revealed twice.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> may require multiple procedures.|$|E

5|$|After hatching, {{the larvae}} spend another 72 hours absorb their yolk sacs and {{developing}} their fins {{before they become}} free-swimming fry. The fry forage during daylight in a dense school {{and return to the}} cave or crevice for the night. Like other cichlids, the parents retrieve their young just before dark, sucking up three or four <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> delivering them into the nest. The parents anticipate night, using a sense of time; in laboratory experiments convict cichlids continued to retrieve young as night approached {{even in the absence of}} any signal, such as dimming light. During the night, the fry bunch up at the bottom of the cave or nest, where the parents fan them.|$|E
5|$|After the consulship {{had been}} {{opened to the}} plebeians, the plebeians were able to hold both the {{dictatorship}} and the censorship. Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could hold only one office <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> ten years must elapse {{between the end of}} his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans. In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals. To win over the tribunes, the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.|$|E
5|$|After {{the path}} was {{finalized}} came the augers and drillers for the holes {{that served as}} foundations for the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and filled {{with a mix of}} water, gravel and dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the frozen ground, the gravel and dirt froze as hard as concrete, sealing the VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, two <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> each had a semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were carried in 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom to the appropriate location, lowered into place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.|$|E

5|$|Crash Bandicoot is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} players control the titular protagonist, Crash, as he traverses several levels in sequence in order to progress. Crash is able to defeat enemies by either jumping on them or using a spinning attack that launches them. Crash will lose a life if he is hit by an enemy or obstacle, or falls into a bottomless pit. Crash can protect himself by collecting Aku Aku masks, which protect Crash from a single hit from an enemy or obstacle (but not pits or other instant-death obstacles). Crash can hold onto two masks <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>and,</b> upon collecting a third mask, will gain temporary invincibility. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, with more lives earned by finding extra life items or by collecting 100 Wumpa Fruit.|$|E
5|$|Dunn's {{training}} facility, Bud Dunn Stables, (later Bud Dunn and Son Stables) was in Florence, Alabama, on a ten-acre property. Dunn {{moved to}} north Alabama from Georgia in the 1950s, and bought out another trainer who was quitting the horse business. By the mid-1980s, Dunn had over 50 horses in training <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> had several full-time employees. He also judged Tennessee Walking Horse shows, including the Spring Celebration, an annual Tennessee Walking Horse show in Shelbyville, Tennessee that is traditionally popular with trainers {{who hope to}} enter horses in the National Celebration later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Each game also {{features}} three toss-up puzzles, which reveal the puzzle one random letter <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> award cash to whoever rings {{in with the}} right answer. The first determines who is interviewed first by the host, the second determines who starts round 1, and the third determines who starts round 4. Respectively, the toss-ups are valued at $1,000, $2,000, and $3,000. In addition to these, each game has a minimum of four rounds, with more played if time permits. Rounds 2 and 3 are respectively started by the next two contestants clockwise from the contestant who began round 1.|$|E

5|$|Georgia Tech's offense {{began the}} final drive {{of the first}} half with 2:55 remaining. The Yellow Jackets started from their 36-yard line and began slowly: Their first play gained no yards, and their second gained eight before a fumble that was {{recovered}} by a fellow Yellow Jacket. A short running play gained three yards, enough for a first down, and the drive continued. Consecutive rushing plays gained few yards <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> Georgia Tech used its timeouts to stop the game clock and prevent time from running out in the half. A 10-yard pass interference penalty pushed Georgia Tech inside the Clemson 20-yard line, and kicker Blair again converted a field goal. The successful kick gave Georgia Tech a 16–13 lead heading into halftime.|$|E
5|$|In Computer Space, {{the player}} {{controls}} a rocket as {{it attempts to}} shoot a pair of flying saucers while avoiding enemy fire. The monochrome game has the three ships flying on a two-dimensional plane, set {{against the backdrop of}} a starfield. Missiles are fired one <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> there is a cooldown period between launches. The player's rocket follows Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the rocket can rotate at a constant rate without inertia. The flying saucers stay in place or glide in a zig-zag pattern around the screen in tandem, with one staying a constant distance directly below the other. If a ship or missile moves past one edge of the screen, it reappears on the other side in a wraparound effect. While the missile is in flight, the player can turn it left or right by turning their rocket.|$|E
5|$|In {{countries}} where {{women have to}} do paid work in order to feed their family, {{there is a lack}} of regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to the large amount of informal work available. In Thailand for example, due to the severe economic crisis in 1997, many women have jobs in the informal industry, and often do home-based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the work intensity by women doing more than one job <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.|$|E

5|$|Joss Whedon {{had wanted}} to make a musical episode {{since the start of the}} series. This was {{heightened}} during the fifth season when he hosted a Shakespeare reading at his house, to which the cast was invited. They began drinking and singing, demonstrating to Whedon that certain cast members had musical talents. Whedon knew he would have to write an entire score, which would take weeks or months. During the first three seasons of Buffy, he was unable to take more than two weeks off <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> the constraints of writing and directing the show precluded him from putting forth the effort of preparing a musical. Whedon spoke to the show's producer, Gareth Davies, about his idea; they agreed that a musical episode would be written.|$|E
5|$|King Kalākaua trusted Rosenberg's {{skill as}} a fortune teller, {{perhaps because the}} way Rosenberg chanted in Hebrew {{reminded}} him of ancient Hawaiian rites. In January 1887, the king—who had become increasingly autocratic and was facing several scandals—granted Rosenberg a private audience at the palace. The king and Rosenberg became close, and routinely visited each other for several days <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> held long conversations. During the audiences, Rosenberg told Bible stories and read from the Talmud. He began to teach the king basic Hebrew, and gave him an ornate Torah and yad that he had brought with him to Hawaii. He also claimed to have found references to Hawaii in ancient Hebrew texts, a statement that encouraged the king to restore aspects of Hawaiian religion. The king had previously sought instruction from several people he regarded as prophets and had established a society dedicated to the revival of native Hawaiian traditions. Finally, the king declared Rosenberg his kahuna-kilokilo, a royal soothsayer.|$|E
5|$|Once elected, a {{governor}} serves a four-year term beginning {{on the date}} he is sworn into office; inauguration day is the second Monday in January. He remains governor until his successor takes the oath of office. The governor's term can be shorter if he resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated or impeached. There is no limit to how many terms {{a governor}} may serve; however, the governor is limited to being elected to two consecutive terms <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> may remain in office a maximum of eight years in any twelve-year period. To be eligible to run for a third term, the governor would have to sit out for one election period.|$|E
