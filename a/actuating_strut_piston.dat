40|$|For several future imaging spacecraft, {{vibration}} isolation and suppression of its optical payloads {{have become a}} challenging problem. These spacecraft have increased perfor-mance requirements for the payload, resulting in increased fine steering and {{vibration isolation}} requirements. The vibration sources on the spacecraft, however, are increased due to the new large flexible structures and addition of rotating devices. One promising way to address both issues is through the Stewart platform. By using a hexapod with six <b>actuated</b> <b>struts,</b> {{it is possible to}} achieve both fine pointing and vibration control.

40|$|The {{category}} of “extremal materials” {{has been introduced}} in the literature to define materials that simultaneously show very soft and very stiff deformation modes (unimode, bimode, trimode, quadramode and pentamode materials, depending {{on the number of}} soft modes). This definition applies to a special class of mechanical metamaterials – composite materials, structural foams, cellular materials, etc. – which feature special mechanical properties. Pentamode materials have been proposed for transformation acoustics and elasto-mechanical cloak, but their potential in dif-ferent engineering fields is still only partially explored. We here present novel versions of pen-tamode materials: artificial structural crystals showing shear moduli markedly smaller than the bulk modulus. Novel pentamode lattices with tensegrity architecture are designed, through the insertion of <b>actuated</b> <b>struts</b> and/or prestressed cables within basic pentamode lattices. Such sys-tems are proposed as tunable seismic base-isolation devices, profiting from their low and adjusta-ble shear moduli, which can be easily adapted to the dynamic properties of the structure to be iso-lated...|$|R
50|$|An oleo strut {{consists}} of an inner metal tube or piston, which {{is attached to the}} wheel axle, and which moves up and down in an outer (or upper) metal tube, or cylinder, that is attached to the airframe. The cavity within the <b>strut</b> and <b>piston</b> is filled with gas (usually nitrogen, sometimes air—especially on light aircraft) and oil (usually hydraulic fluid), and is divided into two chambers that communicate through a small orifice.|$|R
40|$|Owing {{to their}} high mass centre, {{relatively}} soft tyres, extreme {{variations in the}} load and load distributions during work cycles and greater flexibility of the steering system, the articulated steer vehicles (ASV) exhibit lower directional stability limits compared to vehicles with conventional steering. In this study, a kineto-dynamic model of the frame steering mechanism is formulated {{in conjunction with a}} nonlinear yaw-plane model of an articulated dump-truck. The validity of the model is demonstrated based on the available measured data. The proposed model is initially analysed to derive response characteristics of the steering system in terms of articulation angle, valve opening, strut orientations and deflections, fluid pressures and resultant strut forces and torque. The influences of variations in selected operating and design parameters on the steering system responses are investigated under a steady-turning and pulse steering inputs. The results provide important design guidelines with regard to kinematic and dynamic parameters of the steering mechanism and show that the lateral stability of the ASV is strongly influenced by the effective damping of the steering mechanism which is determined by kineto-dynamic characteristics of the articulated steering system including leakage flows across the <b>struts</b> <b>piston,</b> valve flow characteristics and struts orientations...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss {{detailed}} steady and unsteady aerodynamic measurements of a Gulfstream G 550 nose landing gear model. The quarter-scale, high-fidelity model includes part of the lower fuselage and the gear cavity. The full model configuration allowed for removal of various gear components (e. g. light cluster, steering mechanism, hydraulic lines, etc.) in order to document their effects on the local flow field. The measurements were conducted at a Reynolds number of 7. 3 ! 104 based on the shock <b>strut</b> (<b>piston)</b> diameter and a freestream Mach number of 0. 166. Additional data were also collected at lower Mach numbers of 0. 12 and 0. 145 and correspondingly lower Reynolds numbers. The boundary layer on the piston was tripped to enable turbulent flow separation, so as to better mimic the conditions encountered during flight. Steady surface pressures were gathered from an extensive number of static ports on the wheels, door, fuselage, and within the gear cavity. To better understand the resultant flow interactions between gear components, surface pressure fluctuations were collected via sixteen dynamic pressure sensors strategically placed on various sub-components of the gear. Fifteen of the transducers were flush mounted on the gear surface at fixed locations, while the remaining one was a mobile transducer that could be placed at numerous varying locations. The measured surface pressure spectra are mainly broadband in nature, lacking any local peaks associated with coherent vortex shedding. This finding is in agreement with off-surface flow measurements using PIV that revealed the flow field to be a collection of separated shear layers without any dominant vortex shedding processes...|$|R
5000|$|Some makes of air guns {{incorporate}} a gas spring (commonly {{referred to as}} a gas piston, gas ram, gas <b>strut</b> or nitro <b>piston)</b> instead of a mechanical coil spring. The spring itself is essentially a stand-alone enclosed piston pump without outlet and with pressurized air or inert gas (such as nitrogen) held tightly sealed within the cylinder. When the gun is cocked, the gas inside the cylinder gets further compressed by the piston, stores potential energy and acts in effect as a pneumatic accumulator. Gas spring units require higher precision to manufacture, since they require a low-friction sliding seal that can withstand the high pressures when cocked. The advantages of the gas spring include the ability to keep the gun cocked and ready to fire for extended periods of time without long-term spring fatigue, smoother recoil pattern and lower vibration, and faster [...] "lock time" [...] (the time between pulling the trigger and the pellet being discharged) which results in better accuracy. Gas spring air guns are also usually less [...] "hold-sensitive" [...] and hence easier to achieve consistent shot groupings.|$|R
2500|$|Grumman {{had been}} working on a {{successor}} to the F4F Wildcat since 1938 and the contract for the prototype XF6F-1 was signed on 30 June 1941. The aircraft was originally designed to use the Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclone two-row, 14-cylinder radial engine of 1,700hp (1,268kW) driving a three-bladed Curtiss Electric propeller. Instead of the Wildcat's narrow-track, hand-cranked main landing gear retracting into the fuselage that it had inherited, little changed in design from the 1931-debuted Grumman FF-1 fighter biplane, the Hellcat had wide-set, hydraulically <b>actuated</b> landing gear <b>struts</b> which rotated through 90° while retracting backwards into the wings, much like that of the earlier Chance Vought F4U Corsair, but with full wheel doors fitted to the struts that covered the entire strut and the upper half of the main wheel when retracted, and twisted with the main gear struts during retraction. [...] The wing was mounted lower on the fuselage and was able to be hydraulically or manually folded, with each panel outboard of the undercarriage bay folding backwards from pivoting on a specially oriented, Grumman-patented Sto-Wing diagonal axis pivoting system much like the earlier F4F, with a folded stowage position parallel to the fuselage with the leading edges pointing diagonally down.|$|R
40|$|Stewart平台為一種六軸並聯的機構,其結構是在兩個平板間用六根支 柱以平行方式連結而成. 採用此機構設計機械人時,由於其平行式的結構, 使得此種機械人具有以下優點:(1) 不會累積各軸的誤差,因此高精度的要 求較易達成;(2) 驅動軸上所承受的力量主要為壓應力,因此可承受較大的 負載;(3) 平行式的結構使其剛性較高. 這些優點使其在串聯式機械人無法 勝任的應用領域中深具淺力. 本文針對Stewart平台,假設六支柱均由 壓電致動器驅動,首先推導其動力學模式,再提出以回授線性化串聯模糊控 制器之複合控制策略,考慮Stewart平台的慣性力作用及狀態與各驅動軸間 的耦合效應影響,經適當地回授線性化解耦以求得活動平板各支點所需之 作用力,再轉換成各支柱壓電致動器所需之位移輸出量,最後利用模糊控制 策略產生各致動器所需之控制電壓,以達平台之精密定位目標. 為了瞭解所 提控制策略之有效性,文中並以電腦模擬加以驗證. Stewart {{platform}} is a six {{degree of freedom}} (DOF) parallel manipulatoractuated by six linear actuators. The position and orientation of the moving{{platform is}} controlled by the lengths of the six <b>struts</b> <b>actuated</b> by the linearactuators. Each actuator is connected to the base end by a two DOF universaljoint, and connected to the moving platform by a three DOF spherical joint. Using this kind of closed loop mechanism for designing a six DOF motion systemhas several advantages:(1) without error accumulation of each axis to make itwith higher precision; (2) the load force of each strut is only compressive,so it can bear larger load; and (3) due to its closed loop structure, it hashigher stiffness. In this thesis, we assume that the twelve multi-DOF joints guarantee guiding precision and lack of backlash, and that each <b>strut</b> is <b>actuated</b> by apiezoelectric actuator. The dynamics model of the Stewart platform is firstderived and a composite control strategy consisting of moving platform model-based feedback linearization and simple fuzzy logic control is proposedfor six-DOF micropositioning. By cinsidering the six internal axial forceson the six spherical joints at the moving end as the virtual actuating inputforces of the moving platform, feedback linearization can be easily used toderive the desired acting forces of the six struts to moving the end-effector. The corresponding desired linear displacement of each piezoelectric actuatorcan thus be computed based on the strut model, and then each piezoelectricactuator''s control voltage is generated by its simple SISO fuzzy logic controllaw. Computer simulation are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of thesuggested control strategy...|$|R
