40|$|International audienceAn {{overview}} of radiative climate feedbacks and ocean heat uptake efficiency diagnosed from idealized transient climate change experiments of 14 CMIP 5 models is presented. Feedbacks explain about two times more variance in transient climate response across the models than ocean heat uptake efficiency. Cloud feedbacks can clearly {{be identified as}} {{the main source of}} inter-model spread. Models with strong longwave feedbacks in the tropics feature substantial increases in cloud ice around the tropopause suggestive of changes in cloud-top heights. The lifting of the tropical tropopause goes together with a general weakening of the tropical circulation. Distinctive inter-model differences in cloud shortwave feedbacks occur in the subtropics including the equatorward flanks of the storm-tracks. Related cloud fraction changes are not confined to low clouds but comprise middle level clouds as well. A reduction in relative humidity through the lower and mid troposphere can be identified as being the main associated large-scale feature. Experiments with prescribed sea surface temperatures are analyzed in order to investigate whether the diagnosed feedbacks from the transient climate simulations contain a tropospheric adjustment component that is not conveyed through the surface temperature response. The strengths of the climate feedbacks computed from atmosphere-only experiments with prescribed increases in sea surface temperatures, but fixed CO 2 concentrations, are close to the ones derived from the transient experiment. Only the cloud shortwave feedback exhibits discernible differences which, however, can not unequivocally be attributed to tropospheric adjustment to CO 2. Although for some models a tropospheric adjustment component is present in the global mean shortwave cloud feedback, an analysis of spatial patterns does not lend support to the view that cloud feedbacks are dominated by their tropospheric <b>adjustment</b> <b>part.</b> Nevertheless, there is positive correlation between the strength of tropospheric adjustment processes and cloud feedbacks across different climate models...|$|E
40|$|Network {{adjustment}} and deformation monitoring {{are one of}} the main activities of engineering surveying. Geodetic networks are estimated by the method of least-squares estimation (LSE) {{adjustment and}} the ‘goodness’ of the network is measured by a precision analysis based upon the covariance matrix of the estimated parameters. When such a network is designed, global test and local test are assessed to test compatibility of variance factor via two-tailed chi-square distribution and residual of measurements to detect gross error by using a technique pioneered by the geodesist Baarda. The second step is Deformation detection. Generally, the deformation computations can be divided into geotechnical and geodetic methods. There are two types of geodetic networks, namely the absolute and relative networks. In the absolute network, some of the points are assumed to be located out of the deformable body. However, in a relative network, all points are assumed to be located on the deformable body. This study focuses on two dimension (2 -D) absolute geodetic deformation detection via MATLAB 7. Deformation analysis can be handled by several techniques such as Robust (IWST and LAS), Congruency, Bayesian method and etc. This study presents a deformation analysis procedure via geodetic methods that consists of LSE of individual epochs, trend analysis of the displacement field and the deformation detection by IWST between epochs. This research focuses on the development of two programs in MATLAB 7 for network adjustment (distance, angle and azimuth observation respectively) and deformation detection between two epochs. In this project, first LSE adjustment is done for each epoch and creates the appropriate input files for deformation program. Next, deformation program reads them and creates an output file and displays a graphic consists of error ellipse for each stations and displacement vector for moved stations. There are three data sets to run these two programs. For <b>adjustment</b> <b>part</b> the results are compared with STARNET results and for deformation part the results are compared with previous works by Caspary (1987), Ranjit(1999) and Khairulnizam(2004). The results show that these two programs work and there are not significant difference between these results and results from other works...|$|E

30|$|Rhamnolipid {{detection}} {{was performed}} {{as described by}} Schenk et al. (1995) with minor <b>adjustments.</b> <b>Part</b> of the liquid phase was acidified 1 : 100 (v/v) by phosphoric acid and rhamnolipids were extracted twice with 1.25 vol. ethyl acetate. For rhamnolipid measurement appropriate amount of this ethyl acetate extract was evaporated. Rhamnolipids were resolved in acetonitrile and derivatized for 90  min at 1400  rpm and 60  °C using a 1 : 1 mixture of 40  mM bromphenacylbromid and 20  mM tri-ethyl-ammonium/-amin. Detection of rhamnolipids was performed using a HPLC device (Agilent 1100 Series, Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a 15  cm reversed phase column (Supelcosil® LC- 18, Supelco, Deisenhofen, Germany) at 30  °C. The mobile phase was composed of 100  % methanol and ultrapure water. For rhamnolipid detection a gradient was applied. During the first 17  min methanol concentration was increased to 100  % starting at 80  %. This methanol concentration was held for 8  min and decreased to 80  % during the next 5  min. Rhamnolipids were detected at a wave length of 254  nm at 30  °C. For calibration standard solutions of rhamnolipid in acetonitrile were used.|$|R

We {{study the}} {{collapse}} of collusion in Québec’s retail gasoline market following a Com-petition Bureau investigation, and show that it involved two empirical regularities: high margins, and asymmetric price adjustments. Using weekly, station-level prices we test whether collusion was successful, and whether asymmetric <b>adjustments</b> were <b>part</b> of the cartel’s strategy. We {{do so in the}} markets targeted by the investigation, and in markets throughout the province with similar pre-collapse pricing (cyclical markets). Our results suggest that stations in both target and cyclical markets adjusted pricing following the announcement: margins fell (by 30 %/ 15 % in target/cyclical markets), and adjustments became more symmetric. 1...|$|R
50|$|Photographers may employ view camera {{movements}} and the Scheimpflug principle {{to place an}} object close to the lens in focus, while maintaining selective background focus. This technique {{requires the use of}} a view camera or perspective control lens with the ability to tilt the lens with respect to the film or sensor plane. Lenses such as the Nikon PC-E and Canon TS-E series, the Hartblei Super-Rotator, the Schneider Super Angulon, several Lensbaby models, the Zoerk Multi Focus System, and various tilt-shift adapters for medium format, allow the use of tilt in cameras with fixed lens mounts.

In most cases, faculty members use this review to make adjustments to the planned classroom activities.
