Former faculty include industrial efficiency pioneer Frederick Winslow Taylor, marketing professor Brian Wansink, and Michael Jensen, who taught as a visiting scholar.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} Australian {{personnel}} from the SWPA was delayed by shipping shortages {{and the need}} to maintain a force in the area for garrison duties. The military provided these personnel with training courses to prepare them for civilian life. Refresher courses in basic subjects such as maths and English were run first before vocational training began. The teachers <b>and</b> <b>instructors</b> for these courses were service personnel {{selected on the basis of}} their civilian occupations. In addition, sport competitions were conducted to keep the men busy.|$|E
30|$|In summary, the {{relationship}} between CoP membership <b>and</b> student <b>and</b> <b>instructor</b> behaviors were modeled using seven multiple regressions with the counts of the collapsed student <b>and</b> <b>instructor</b> behaviors as the dependent variable, <b>and</b> CoP membership, <b>instructor</b> rank, course enrollment, and course type (foundational or non-foundational) as the independent variables. A multiple linear regression was used to model the counts for instructor guiding. A Poisson log-linear model was used to model the counts for student talking <b>and</b> <b>instructor</b> other. A ZIP log-linear model was used to model the counts for student working, student other, the absence of student receiving, {{and the absence of}} instructor presenting. In addition, to analyze {{the relationship}} between <b>instructor</b> <b>and</b> student behavior for both CoP <b>and</b> non-CoP <b>instructors,</b> we calculated Pearson correlations between student working <b>and</b> <b>instructor</b> guiding, <b>and</b> between student talking <b>and</b> <b>instructor</b> guiding for each group. We present the coefficient of determination (i.e., the square of the Pearson correlation) in the “Results” section because this quantity represents the percentage of variance in one variable that is predictable from the other variable.|$|R
50|$|The two seating {{configurations}} for trainer aircraft are: pilot <b>and</b> <b>instructor</b> side by side, or in tandem, {{usually with}} the pilot in front <b>and</b> the <b>instructor</b> behind. The side-by-side seating configuration {{has the advantage}} that pilot <b>and</b> <b>instructor</b> can see each other's actions, allowing the pilot {{to learn from the}} <b>instructor</b> <b>and</b> the <b>instructor</b> to correct the student pilot. The tandem configuration has the advantage of being closer to the normal working environment that a fast jet pilot is likely to encounter.|$|R

5|$|A {{total of}} {{approximately}} 16,000 German citizens {{fought in the}} Civil War, mostly as pilots, ground crew, artillery men, tank crew, and as military advisers <b>and</b> <b>instructors.</b> About 10,000 Germans was the maximum strength at any one time. Approximately 300 Germans were killed. During {{the course of the}} war, Germany sent 732 combat aircraft and 110 trainer aircraft to Spain. German aid to the Nationalists amounted to approximately £43,000,000 ($215,000,000) in 1939 prices. This was broken down in expenditure to: 15.5% used for salaries and expenses, 21.9% used for direct delivery of supplies to Spain, and 62.6% expended on the Condor Legion. No detailed list of German supplies furnished to Spain has been found. Franco had also agreed to sign over the output of six mines to help pay for German aid.|$|E
5|$|Each of the Chinese vessels were {{equipped}} with Chinese crews, with Western captains <b>and</b> <b>instructors</b> in place. They sailed {{out of the}} Tyne River on 9 August, and stopped in Plymouth Sound two days later where Admiral Ding Ruchang joined them to take command of the ships for the journey to China. Following their arrival on 20 October in Hong Kong, they toured Canton (now Guangzhou) and Shanghai, before travelling to the Taku Forts. Chaoyong was boarded by Hongzhang, and the two cruisers took the diplomat to inspect the dredging of the port at Taku (now the Port of Tianjin). Both ships {{were assigned to the}} Beiyang Fleet in the north, and Ruchang was placed in command.|$|E
5|$|For {{one year}} it {{met in the}} {{basement}} of Pleasantville's public school (until the Briarcliff Farms building was completed), and did not provide housing. The farm building was completed in spring 1901 and dedicated on May 15. The large Colonial Revival building, with a plain exterior and wide halls, had lecture halls, a library, a laboratory, an office, a dining hall and dormitory space for 40 staff members and students. Its grounds had an orchard, a working garden, experimental greenhouses, poultry houses, a farmhouse and barns. The school's faculty included a director, a horticulturalist, an agriculturalist <b>and</b> <b>instructors</b> in nature study and cold storage. It was coeducational, with identical courses for men and women. Students were required to be proficient in English, provide good references, be at least 16 years of age, and be in good health. On January 1, 1902 Henry Francis du Pont, then in his third year at Harvard University, wrote to Powell requesting admission to the school; Powell replied that DuPont was listed first in the school's 1903 class. However, DuPont was unable to attend and left Harvard (perhaps due to his mother's sudden death in autumn 1902).|$|E

5|$|Formerly {{the privately}} owned Macquarie Grove Aerodrome, Camden {{was a new}} air base, and the school's {{facilities}} cost £53,000 to construct. On establishment, its personnel numbered 470 officers and airmen, and its complement of aircraft included twenty-three Tiger Moths, nine CAC Wirraways, and fourteen Avro Ansons. Among the staff were former civil pilots <b>and</b> <b>instructors,</b> as well as career Air Force officers. Graduates from Camden included Bill Newton, later awarded the Victoria Cross for bombing raids in New Guinea, and Jerry Pentland, a World WarI fighter ace with twenty-three victories, {{who went on to}} become perhaps the oldest RAAF pilot on active duty. The outbreak of the Pacific War led to an influx of United States Army Air Forces units to Australian bases, including Camden. To make way, CFS moved to Tamworth, New South Wales, during March and April 1942. Tamworth was not considered a suitable airfield for the school's Wirraways, Ansons and Airspeed Oxfords, and a further relocation was deemed necessary, this time to RAAF Station Parkes, New South Wales, on 18January 1944. Later that year, CFS moved once more, returning on 19September to Point Cook. There it gained an aviation medicine section, which in 1956 was detached to form the RAAF School of Aviation Medicine (later the RAAF Institute of Aviation Medicine). CFS remained at Point Cook {{for the rest of the}} war, by which time it had graduated some 3,600 instructors.|$|E
5|$|Four RAAF units {{converted}} to the Hornet between 1985 and 1988. The first 14 Hornets were allocated to No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit (2OCU) at RAAF Base Williamtown, and {{were used to}} train the pilots <b>and</b> <b>instructors</b> needed to convert the RAAF's three fighter squadrons to the aircraft. 2OCU's first Hornet operational conversion course began on 19 August 1985. In addition to the unit's training activities, 2OCU aircraft travelled widely around Australia and South East Asia during 1985 and 1986 to showcase the new aircraft. No.3 Squadron was the first fighter unit to convert from the MirageIII, and became operational with the Hornet in August 1986. It was followed by No.77 Squadron in June 1987 and No.75 Squadron in May 1988. No.81 Wing, whose headquarters is located at Williamtown, has commanded these four units since they {{converted to}} the F/A-18. As of 2012, 2OCU, No.3 and No.77 Squadrons are stationed at Williamtown and No.75 Squadron is located at Tindal. In addition, two Hornets are allocated to the Aircraft Research and Development Unit at RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia.|$|E
5|$|In response, on 29 March, the British Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha {{announced}} plans to increase the Territorial Army (TA) from 130,000 men to 340,000 {{and in so doing}} double the number of territorial divisions. The intended plan of action was for the existing units to recruit over their allowed establishments (aided by an increase in pay for territorials, the removal of restrictions on promotion that had been a major hindrance to recruiting during the preceding years, the construction of better quality barracks, and an increase in supper-time rations) and then form 'second-line' divisions from small cadres that could be built upon. As a result, the 61st Infantry Division was to be created as a second-line unit, a duplicate of the first-line 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division. In April, limited conscription was introduced. At that time 34,500 'Militiamen', all of the age of 20, were conscripted into the regular army with the intent of being trained for six months before being deployed to the forming second line units. However, despite the intention for the army to grow in size, the programme was complicated by a lack of central guidance on the expansion and duplication process, and issues regarding the lack of facilities, equipment, <b>and</b> <b>instructors.</b>|$|E

5|$|There is also {{an annual}} Fighter Weapons Instructor Course (FWIC) run by No.410 Squadron, and a Fighter Electronic Warfare and Advanced Radar (FEWAR) Course. The intense and highly {{challenging}} FWIC lasts for three months. Each operational CF-18 squadron and tactical radar squadron sends candidates (eight students per course) who graduate with the leadership qualities and expertise required {{to return to their}} squadrons and design tactical training programs themselves. The Advanced Radar Course is conducted in two phases: ground school at 4 Wing, Cold Lake, and a flying phase at an electronic warfare range. This three-week course is designed to allow ten pilots annually to graduate and return to their squadrons as electronic warfare experts <b>and</b> <b>instructors.</b> Since No.410 Squadron has always had some of the most experienced CF-18 pilots in the fighter community, it is often charged with carrying out special fighter projects. The squadron conducted the operational testing and evaluation of the CF's precision guided munitions, and in 2010 was anticipating testing the use of night vision devices in the Hornet.|$|E
