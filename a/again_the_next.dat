He proposed to her in 1895 and <b>again</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year, but she turned him down on both occasions because of their differing views on religion. This rejection affected Synge greatly and reinforced his determination to spend as much time as possible outside Ireland.|$|E

During the battle Dundas was hit in the leg when a cannon round exploded in his cockpit, but flew <b>again</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day. The Spitfire Dundas flew that day, R6915, still exists, having been preserved by the Imperial War Museum. By 9 October 1940, his score stood at 10 and he was award the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E

5|$|On 9 April 1940 the Germans {{launched}} Operation Weserübung. Poor visibility enabled {{most of the}} German invasion fleet {{to evade}} detection {{until it was too}} late. Reconnaissance aircraft of Coastal Command had sighted and reported movements of the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau on 7 April. However, they were believed to be on exercise and not operations. They were sighted <b>again</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day by No. 204 Squadron RAFs Sunderlands. Coastal Command was now ordered to carry out extensive reconnaissance operations in the North Sea and around the Norwegian Coast. It was the Command's reconnaissance operations that located the German cruiser Königsberg in Bergen fjord. Blackburn Skuas of No. 800 and 803 Squadrons FAA sank the vessel.|$|E
5|$|One {{approach}} is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more probable. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food <b>again</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about what precise probability any given evidence justifies putting on the general statement. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are subjective, or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after its}} peak, Hurricane Hilary's motion became unsteady. After nearly stalling, the {{hurricane}} {{turned to the}} west on August22, only to become nearly stationary <b>again</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day. Slowly executing a small counter-clockwise loop, Hilary underwent a Fujiwhara interaction with Tropical Storm Irwin which was several hundred miles southeast. Meanwhile, Hilary began to weaken, by early on August22, the eye became poorly defined and convection diminished. The eye dissipated within 12 hours, and the winds quickly diminished to 85mph (130km/h). Later that day, the thunderstorm activity became partially exposed from the center, and on August23, Hilary was downgraded to a tropical storm {{due to lack of}} organization.|$|E

On {{the day of the}} ballet, however, he inadvertently gets his arm stuck in a vending machine while trying to steal a can of soda from it and then gets his other arm stuck in a candy machine, and so is unable to attend the ballet. In disbelief about Homer's story, Marge invites her neighbor, Ruth Powers to attend with her. They both enjoy themselves and arrange to go out <b>again</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> night. Marge and Ruth's friendship annoys Homer, who feels Marge should be spending time with him instead. However, ignoring Homer's protests, Marge and Ruth visit bars and clubs in Springfield, and Ruth later shows Marge how to use a pistol.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{returning}} to the United States following his service in Siberia, Eichelberger became Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 (Intelligence), of the Philippine Department on 4 May 1920.

Em had joined him in Vladivostok in March 1920, and the two first travelled to Japan before moving on to the Philippines. In March 1921, Eichelberger became head of the Intelligence Mission to China. He established intelligence offices in Peking and Tientsin, and met the President of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen. He finally returned to the United States in May 1921, where he was assigned to the Far Eastern Section of the G-2 (Intelligence) Division of the War Department General Staff.|$|E
5|$|Montreal {{finished}} {{in last place}} in the Northeast Division in 1998–99 and missed the playoffs. Their 75 points was the lowest total in a full season in 40 years. The season concluded with rumours of the team being sold and relocated {{if it did not}} receive government subsidies to help alleviate pressures from Quebec's tax system and the record-low value of the Canadian dollar. The Canadiens denied the report, however Molson hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to examine its future involvement in sports. Montreal missed the playoffs <b>again</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two seasons, and annual losses of $10–$12million and a desire to focus on its core brewing business led Molson to put the franchise up for sale in the summer of 2001.|$|E

5|$|On 22 August {{a patrol}} from the 13th Parachute Battalion succeeded in {{crossing}} the eastern {{branch of the}} river, and was quickly reinforced {{by the rest of}} the battalion. They fought for three hours to gain a proper foothold and were then forced to withdraw <b>again.</b> <b>The</b> <b>next</b> day, patrols from the 7th Parachute Battalion discovered that the Germans had withdrawn during the night, and they therefore crossed the river and secured the high ground to the north, closely followed {{by the rest of the}} brigade. On 25August the 1st Special Service Brigade took over as the lead formation, and headed towards Beuzeville, but once again German defences held up the advance. The 3rd Parachute Brigade and the 4th Special Service Brigade carried out a left flanking attack to capture the village, suffering heavy losses from German mortar fire.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{made the}} {{championship}} game <b>again</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year, but lost in a rematch to the Packers, 31–16. They also advanced to {{the championship game}} in 1941, losing to the Bears, 37–9. Both games were close early before their respective opponents went on an offensive surge to break the game open late. In 1944, the Giants reached the championship game, where they faced the Green Bay Packers {{for the third time}} in ten seasons. They lost again, this time 14–7 as Ted Fritsch scored two touchdowns, and the Packers defense held on to the lead despite a fourth-quarter touchdown by the Giants. By 1946, Mara had given over complete control of the team to his two sons. Jack controlled the business aspects, while Wellington controlled the on-field operations. In 1946, the Giants again reached the Championship game, for the eighth time in 14 seasons. However, they were beaten by the Sid Luckman-led Bears, 24–14.|$|E

Colt McCoy fumbled a few plays later to give the ball back to Texas A Fiveplays later, Stephen McGee scampered {{into the end zone}} for a five-yard touchdown to put the Aggies up 24–10. The Longhorns took little time to answer with a touchdown of their own. Quan Cosby returned the following kickoff 91yards for a touchdown to pull Texas within seven once <b>again.</b> <b>The</b> <b>next</b> drive started on the Aggie 49-yard line, courtesy of a 42-yard kickoff return by E.J.

5|$|Yao {{first tried}} {{out for the}} Shanghai Sharks junior team of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) when he was {{thirteen}} years old, and practiced ten {{hours a day for}} his acceptance. After playing with the junior team for four years, Yao joined the senior team of the Sharks, where he averaged 10points and 8rebounds a game in his rookie season. His next season was cut short when he broke his foot {{for the second time in}} his career, which Yao said decreased his jumping ability by four to six inches (10 to 15cm). The Sharks made the finals of the CBA in Yao's third season and <b>again</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year, but lost both times to the Bayi Rockets. When Wang Zhizhi left the Bayi Rockets to become the first NBA player from China the following year, the Sharks finally won their first CBA championship. During the playoffs in his final year with Shanghai, Yao averaged 38.9points and 20.2rebounds a game, while shooting 76.6% from the field, and made all 21 of his shots during one game in the finals.|$|E
5|$|During their record-setting {{streak of}} sixteen {{consecutive}} losing seasons, the Phillies posted their franchise record for losses {{in a season}} in 1941 with 111, falling shy of the modern (post-dead-ball era) Major League record of 120 losses in a season. During the 2007 season, the franchise also became the first professional sports team in American history to reach 10,000 losses. The Phillies have thrice surpassed the century mark for wins in a season: in 1976 with 101 wins, when they made their first playoff appearance in twenty-six seasons; <b>again</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> season when they matched that mark; and in 2011, when they set the franchise single-season record for wins with 102 victories and clinched a playoff position at the earliest point in team history. Philadelphia finished the 2010 season {{with a record of}} 97–65, marking {{the first time that the}} team completed a season with Major League Baseball’s best record; they duplicated this accomplishment in 2011 as the majors' only 100-win team. Since 2011, the Phillies have declined again and in 2015 they suffered the worst record in MLB and the franchise’s worst since an equally-poor record in 1969, with their worst before than from 1961.|$|E

5|$|Keith Park, with {{endorsement}} from Dowding, {{opted for}} the opposite strategy. Park maintained that it was unimportant to inflict large losses on the Germans in comparison to safeguarding his own forces. Park believed the Germans would give up if they could not achieve their aim of air superiority. This, simply put, meant avoiding the destruction and or depletion of Fighter Command was the primary factor in air defence. This would be achieved by sending small numbers of fighters to intercept, minimising losses in the air. By remaining to offer undiminished and constant air opposition, the RAF ensured the Luftwaffe could not win. As long {{as some sort of}} cost was imposed before the enemy dropped his bombs and impaired the defence system, the RAF could remain intact to meet the threat <b>again</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day. To this end, Park favoured the 10 bomber kills before the attack, rather than the 50 shot down after it. The strategy suggested an enemy would give up if he felt he was getting nowhere. For even while his losses remained moderate, it would be senseless to suffer those casualties for no return. Park and Dowding's strategy, under the circumstances, was the wiser choice.|$|E
5|$|Patton left France for New York City on March 2, 1919. After {{the war he}} was {{assigned}} to Camp Meade, Maryland, and reverted to his permanent rank of captain on June 30, 1920, though he was promoted to major <b>again</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day. Patton was given temporary duty in Washington D.C. that year to serve on a committee writing a manual on tank operations. During this time he developed a belief that tanks should be used not as infantry support, but rather as an independent fighting force. Patton supported the M1919 tank design created by J. Walter Christie, a project which was shelved due to financial considerations. While on duty in Washington, D.C., in 1919, Patton met Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would play an enormous role in Patton's future career. During and following Patton's assignment in Hawaii, he and Eisenhower corresponded frequently. Patton sent Eisenhower notes and assistance to help him graduate from the General Staff College. With Christie, Eisenhower, {{and a handful of other}} officers, Patton pushed for more development of armored warfare in the interwar era. These thoughts resonated with Secretary of War Dwight Davis, but the limited military budget and prevalence of already-established Infantry and Cavalry branches meant the U.S. would not develop its armored corps much until 1940.|$|E
5|$|Pre-season for Plymouth Argyle {{began on}} 1 July 2009 {{when the first}} team squad {{returned}} to Harpers Park. A week of intense training followed, before the club's first match of the new season took place on 13 July 2009 against Cornish side Truro City. In a match which featured trialist Kári Árnason, Argyle scored a goal in each half to earn a comfortable win. A youthful Argyle team headed across the city of Plymouth {{the next day to}} take on Plymouth Parkway. The visitors fell behind to an early goal but responded with three of their own in an entertaining friendly, including a brace from Republic of Ireland youth international Joe Mason. The first team were in action <b>again</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day, against Torquay United. The visitors went behind twice but looked like leaving Plainmoor with a win until Torquay converted a penalty in the 90th minute. The squad then departed for a tour of Scotland, and stopped off in the north of England on the way in order to play a friendly against Skelmersdale United on 18 July 2009. Argyle came away with a 2–0 win after scoring a goal in each half. A picturesque setting greeted the squad as they took to the field against Livingston on 20 July 2009. An 81st-minute penalty from Luke Summerfield wasn't enough to save Argyle from their first defeat of the season.|$|E
