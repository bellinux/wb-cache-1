40|$|The {{expression}} of TRB 3 (tribbles 3), an apoptosis regulated gene, increases during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. How mechanical stress affects {{the regulation of}} TRB 3 in cardiomyocytes during apoptosis is not fully understood. An in vivo model of aorta-caval shunt in adult rats demonstrated the increased TRB 3 protein expression in the myocardium. The tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) antagonist etanercept reversed the TRB 3 protein expression and cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by AV shunt. An in vitro model of cyclic stretch in neonatal rats was also used to investigate TRB 3 expression. We hypothesized that cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced <b>by</b> cyclic <b>stretch</b> is TRB 3 dependent. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes grown on a flexible membrane base were <b>stretched</b> <b>by</b> vacuum to 20 % of maximum elongation, at 60 cycles/min. Cyclic stretch significantly increased TRB 3 protein and mRNA expression. Addition of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP 600125, TNF-α antibody and etanercept 30 min before stretch reversed the induction of TRB 3 protein induced <b>by</b> <b>stretch.</b> Cyclic stretch induced the DNA-binding activity of growth arrest and DNA damaged inducible gene- 153 (GADD 153) by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. SP 600125, JNK siRNA, TNF-α antibody and etanercept abolished the binding activity induced <b>by</b> <b>stretch.</b> TRB 3 promoter activity was enhanced <b>by</b> <b>stretch</b> and TRB 3 -mut plasmid, SP 600125, TNF-α antibody and etanercept attenuated TRB 3 promoter activity induced <b>by</b> <b>stretch.</b> Exogenous administration of TNF-α recombinant protein to the non-stretched cardiomyocytes increased TRB 3 protein expression similar to that seen after stretch. Cyclic stretch induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis is inhibited by TRB 3 siRNA and etanercept. The stretch-induced TRB 3 is mediated by TNF-α、JNK and GADD 153 pathway. These results indicate that TRB 3 {{plays an important role}} in stretch-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis...|$|R
