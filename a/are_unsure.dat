5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of {{surviving}} attributed works, {{it is difficult to}} detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians <b>are</b> <b>unsure</b> if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that the more advanced Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{quicksand}} predator trap {{was discovered}} containing multiple Utahraptor specimens {{ranging in age}} from fully grown adult to tiny 3 foot long baby. Some scientists have hypothesized this is evidence of family hunting behaviour, however the full sandstone block is yet to be opened and researchers <b>are</b> <b>unsure</b> {{as to whether or not}} the animals died at the same time or not.|$|E
5|$|Scientists <b>are</b> <b>unsure</b> of {{the purpose}} of whale songs. Only males sing, {{suggesting}} one purpose is to attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing may, therefore, be a challenge to other males. Some scientists have hypothesized the song may serve an echolocative function. During the feeding season, humpbacks make unrelated vocalizations for herding fish into their bubble nets.|$|E

5|$|A {{very similar}} archway {{is found in}} Dieric Bouts's c. 1445 Mary Altarpiece, {{including}} spandrels with warriors. Art historians <b>are</b> <b>unsure</b> which was painted earlier– Christus's Nativity or Bouts's altarpiece. Equally, van der Weyden's arched triptychs were executed {{at roughly the same}} period, but art historians are more certain Rogier's archivolt design set the precedent. Unlike Bouts and van der Weyden, Christus appears to have used the device to encompass a single scene, incorporating all the main characters within the arch, instead of a linked series of scenes with separate archways.|$|E

5|$|After the Texas Revolution ended, the {{original}} {{draft of the}} letter was given to Travis's family in Alabama. Several prominent Texians {{are known to have}} visited Travis's estranged wife shortly after the hostilities ended, but historians <b>are</b> <b>unsure</b> which of these men might have delivered the letter. Travis's daughter Susan (aged five {{at the time of his}} death) passed the letter down to her descendants; it eventually reached her great-grandson, John G. Davidson. In February 1891, Davidson lent the letter to the Texas Department of Agriculture, Insurance, Statistics, and History. Two years later, Davidson offered to sell the letter to the state of Texas for $250 ($ today). This represented half of the annual sum allocated for collecting historical manuscripts, and the state was hesitant to agree. After negotiations, Davidson agreed to accept $85 ($ today) for the letter, and on May 29 it officially passed into state ownership.|$|E

5|$|Scholars <b>are</b> <b>unsure</b> whether either chronicler {{was present}} that evening. According to Crane, Froissart {{wrote of the}} event about five years later, and the monk about ten. Veenstra speculates that the monk {{may have been an}} {{eyewitness}} (as he was for much of Charles VI's reign) and that his account is the more accurate of the two. The monk's chronicle is generally accepted as essential for understanding the King's court, however his neutrality may have been affected by his pro-Burgundian and anti-Orléanist stance, causing him to depict the royal couple in a negative manner. A third account was written in the mid-15th century by Jean Juvenal des Ursins in his biography of Charles, L'Histoire de Charles VI: roy de France, not published until 1614.|$|E
5|$|Castro became {{critical}} of the corruption and violence of Grau's regime, delivering a public speech on the subject in November 1946 that earned him {{a place on the}} front page of several newspapers. In contact with members of student leftist groups – including the Popular Socialist Party (Partido Socialista Popular – PSP), the Socialist Revolutionary Movement (Movimiento Socialista Revolucionaria – MSR) and the Insurrectional Revolutionary Union (Unión Insurrecional Revolucionaria – UIR) – he grew close to the UIR, although biographers <b>are</b> <b>unsure</b> whether he became a member. In 1947, Castro joined a new socialist group, the Party of the Cuban People (Partido Ortodoxo), founded by veteran politician Eduardo Chibás (1907–1951). A charismatic figure, Chibás advocated social justice, honest government, and political freedom, while his party exposed corruption and demanded reform. Though Chibás lost the election, Castro remained committed to working on his behalf. Student violence escalated after Grau employed gang leaders as police officers, and Castro soon received a death threat urging him to leave the university; he refused and began carrying a gun and surrounding himself with armed friends. In later years Castro was accused of attempting gang-related assassinations during this period, including that of UIR member Lionel Gómez, MSR leader Manolo Castro and university policeman Oscar Fernandez, but these charges remain unproven.|$|E
5|$|Several {{plans were}} introduced, {{with the most}} {{important}} plan being that of James Madison (the Virginia Plan). The Convention's work was mostly a matter of modifying this plan. Charles Pinckney also introduced a plan, although this wasn't considered and its exact character has been lost to history. After the Convention was well under way, the New Jersey Plan was introduced though never seriously considered. It was mainly a protest to what some delegates thought was the excessively radical change from the Articles of Confederation. Alexander Hamilton also offered a plan after the Convention was well under way, though it included an executive serving for life and therefore the delegates felt it too closely resembled a monarchy. Historians <b>are</b> <b>unsure</b> how serious he was about this, and some have speculated {{that he may have}} done it to make Madison's plan look moderate by comparison. The Connecticut Compromise wasn't a plan but one of several compromises offered by the Connecticut delegation. It was key to the ultimate ratification of the constitution, but was only included after being modified by Benjamin Franklin {{in order to make it}} more appealing to larger states.|$|E

25|$|Negative {{effects of}} {{solitude}} may also depend on age. Elementary age school children who experience frequent solitude may react negatively. This is largely because, often, solitude {{at this age}} is not something chosen by the child. Solitude in elementary-age children may occur when they <b>are</b> <b>unsure</b> of how to interact socially with others so they prefer to be alone, causing shyness or social rejection.|$|E
25|$|Hot Creek {{has been}} a popular {{swimming}} hole for decades. Over a dozen {{people have died in}} Hot Creek since the late 1960s, but most of these deaths happened to people who ignored the numerous warning signs and attempted to use the hydrothermal pools as hot tubs (like the stream portion of the creek, these pools alternate in temperature but the eruptions in the pools are of super-heated water in already very hot water). Recent geothermal instability has led to its temporary closure for swimming. Officials <b>are</b> <b>unsure</b> of when (if ever) Hot Creek will officially reopen for swimming.|$|E
25|$|The {{records of}} the first people near Willow Bunch are few, but they left behind a piece of {{themselves}} at the St. Victor petroglyphs. St. Victor is 19km west of Willow Bunch. The petroglyphs are carvings of many Great Plains Indian symbols. Carvings include several variations of human faces, many types of hooves, turtles, grizzly bear paws, and human handprints. These were carved into the rock faces approximately AD 500-1700. Since there are no carvings of horses or horse hooves, researchers assume the carvings were created before 1750, the approximate year horses arrived {{in the northern part of}} the plains. The carvings' use may have been for records or as a way of communication, but researchers <b>are</b> <b>unsure.</b>|$|E

25|$|Research {{is fairly}} {{consistent}} in {{the finding that}} species with concealed estrus mate at all stages of their ovarian cycle. For instance, mating activity in assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis) has been investigated. The researchers analysed the levels of progesterone in the monkeys, {{in order to establish}} the ovarian stage of the female, as progesterone peaks following the fertile window. They found that the females concealed estrus and were sexually receptive during the entire mating season. Concealed estrus and sexual receptivity (at all times of the ovarian cycle) aids paternity confusion. This is because the males <b>are</b> <b>unsure</b> of who mated with the female during her fertile period, and so do not know the identity of the father.|$|E
25|$|One {{man who has}} {{encountered}} this problem is Taiwanese politician Yu Shyi-kun, due to the rarity of the last character in his name. Newspapers have dealt with this problem in varying ways, including using software to combine two existing, similar characters, including {{a picture of the}} personality, or, especially {{as is the case with}} Yu Shyi-kun, simply substituting a homophone for the rare character in the hope that the reader would be able to make the correct inference. Taiwanese political posters, movie posters etc. will often add the bopomofo phonetic symbols next to such a character. Japanese newspapers may render such names and words in katakana instead of kanji, and it is accepted practice for people to write names for which they <b>are</b> <b>unsure</b> of the correct kanji in katakana instead.|$|E
25|$|Like in English, Dutch has {{generalised}} the dative {{over the}} accusative case for all pronouns, e.g. Du me, je, Eng me, you, vs. Germ mich/mir dich/dir. There is one exception: the standard language prescribes {{that in the}} third person plural, hen is to be used for the direct object, and hun for the indirect object. This distinction was artificially introduced in the 17th century by grammarians, and is largely ignored in spoken language and not well understood by Dutch speakers. Consequently, the third person plural forms hun and hen are interchangeable in normal usage, with hun being more common. The shared unstressed form ze is also often used as both direct and indirect objects and is a useful avoidance strategy when people <b>are</b> <b>unsure</b> which form to use.|$|E
