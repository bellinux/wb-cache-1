40|$|Unmanned {{autonomous}} {{ships are}} seen as a key element of a competitive and sustainable European shipping industry in future. However, even if the technology to automate ships further will principally be available at some point, this does not imply that <b>autonomous</b> <b>vessels</b> are also the superior choice for the ship owner. In the end the success of <b>autonomous</b> <b>vessels</b> depends crucially on their impact on the profitability of shipping companies. This paper analyzes the cost of running an autonomous ship and compares them against a conventional vessel in an cost-benefit analysis. Hereby it presents insights on the economics of <b>autonomous</b> <b>vessels</b> for a first-time. Results principally confirm an economic potential: The autonomous vessel is found to reduce the expected present value of cost of running a ship over a 25 -year period by mUSD 4. 3 compared to a conventionally manned ship. This advantageousness is based on one aspect in particular as this paper argues: besides cost savings associated with reducing crew levels an autonomous ship brings along additional benefits due to changes in ship design...|$|E

40|$|Maritime {{transport}} is {{an essential}} part of today´s logistics chains. Nevertheless, due to technical and environmental constraints as well as historical reasons, vessels are only partly connected to logistics networks. The demand for autonomous ships is basically motivated to increase substainability, competitiveness and growth of maritime transport itself, as stated by Europe´s Waterborne Technology Platform. Notwithstanding, it could furthermore enable a better integration of vessels into coordinated international logistics networks as a by-product. Furthermore, vessels as autonomous logistics entities would be an advantageous possibility to implement future logistics chains. Therefore the initial review concentrates on the eligibility of vessels as autonomous maritime logistics entities. Following it is explained how the development of <b>autonomous</b> <b>vessels</b> could be embedded into existing research activities in the field of ship operations. Navigation is regarded as one key challenge for development of autonomous ships. Especially the tasks route finding and collision avoidance are seen to be critical to derive the necessary information for a better integration into coordinated logistics systems.

40|$|Autonomous surface {{vehicles}} {{are still in}} the early stages of development, and show great potential. These vessels can be used in different scientific and commercial operations, outperforming manned vessels in safety, endurance and cost efficiency. A Dynamic Positioning (DP) control system has been developed for, and implemented on, a scale model of DNV GL s concept ship ReVolt. This model-scale ship, called ReVolt, is used as a test platform for an autonomous ferry, as well as an early test platform for sensors and control systems for <b>autonomous</b> <b>vessels.</b> As a result, this thesis primarily focus' on the functionality and implementation of the components and control system required to achieve DP capabilities on ReVolt. A DP control system has been developed, consisting of a 3 -Degree of Freedom reference filter and a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller with a model-based feedforward from the reference. DNV GL's thrust allocation has been implemented and an Error-state Kalman Filter is developed. The DP control system is implemented on ReVolt's onboard computer, which runs the Robot Operating System (ROS) on top of a Linux shell. The control system has furthermore been simulated in Matlab to develop and test its functionality. Extensive field tests has been completed, where the main objective was to achieve station keeping and low-speed maneuvering capabilities on ReVolt.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{autonomous}} collision avoidance {{has continued to}} advance in many areas including sensory and perception, navigation, payload integration, and collision avoidance. The advances in collision avoidance, however, have largely focused on iterative changes to the velocity obstacle - an algorithm that inherently loses important collision avoidance information key to replicating a human-like decision space. This thesis examines algorithms that generalize the traditional velocity obstacle into a multi-threshold based approach that more realistically represent and evaluate human ship driving practices. Novel protocol-constrained collision avoidance evaluation algorithms are proposed including the ability to perform both on-line and post-mission analysis of both robots and humans. These algorithms become especially important when considering complex missions of competing objectives in a contact-dense, protocol-constrained collision avoidance environment. Introduction of competing performance metrics consistent with human ship driving practices allows autonomous collision avoidance algorithm designers to consider previously unexplored tradespaces. On-water results of up to five simultaneously interacting <b>autonomous</b> <b>vessels</b> validate the collision avoidance algorithms using four key areas of evaluation: spatial efficiency, temporal efficiency, protocol compliance, and safety. Testing of 10 complex scenarios totaled over 6, 150 vehicle-pair on-water encounters. Human-robot field experimentation demonstrated autonomous collision avoidance performance under conflicting protocol requirements of COLREGS while interacting with human-driven vessels. An autonomous collision avoidance "road test" framework is proposed to incorporate testing of arbitrary collision avoidance algorithms both {{in the field and}} in simulation. by Kyle Woerner.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the design of an autonomous ferry to transport people between Ravnkloa and Fosenkaia in Trondheim. It will also be considered whether or not it will be a better solution than a bridge. The operational area of the ferry is limited to the 100 metres stretch between the two docks. The ferry should not require any personnel on board to operate, but it is assumed that a supervisor can oversee the operations from a land base. The surrounding elements of the system was outlined for easy adaptation, but not designed to full detail due to time limitations. The autonomous system itself was not considered directly as it is outside the team members area of expertise. The work in this thesis follows the System Based Ship Design (SBSD) methodology, combined with the Risk Based Ship Design (RBSD) method. In order to apply both methods simultaneously, they were slightly adapted to fit the design study. A bigger emphasis has been put on the functional analysis in the SBSD approach. This makes it easier to determine a good solution for the design. The design study initiates with the mission statement, and sets the main functional requirements for the design based on this. Both relevant generic- and safety related functional requirements were set according to the main functions. The safety related functions were determined by performing a formal safety assessment. To reveal all possible solutions to the functional requirements, a brainstorming session was performed. The alternatives were continuously evaluated against relevant framework conditions and the least relevant ones excluded, thus limiting the final solution throughout the design process. The required area and volume on board, determined using model- and life size test, determined the initial main dimensions. The final design was evaluated on technical performance, economy and safety performance. Stability- strength- and resistance calculations were used to verify the design, in addition to determining the life cycle costs (LCC). The result of this study is the design of an autonomous ferry with electrical power supply and a ramp used for mooring and entrance. The ferry is 9 m long with a beam of 4 m. The design draught of the vessel is 0. 515 m. The ferry can transport up to 12 passengers, including three wheelchairs, and 30 kg luggage per person. There is also room for twelve bicycles on board. The building material is aluminium. The ferry superstructure is semi - open with two broad pillars supporting the roof. The ferry will dock at piers separated from other docks in the area. An information poster is located at the dock to inform passengers on relevant safety issues. The registration gates lock of the docking area to the people on the dock. Entry to the dock is done using a gangway. The design ensures that the passenger comfort is sufficiently good. The ferry is able to transport all types of pedestrians, and is thus able to substitute a bridge. The weakness of the ferry option is that passengers may need to wait a few minutes to use the ferry. The ferry's life cycle costs were estimated at approximately NOK 2. 4 million over 15 years. This is significantly lower than the price tag for the bridge, estimated at NOK 42 million. Thus, the the ferry is considered a good alternative. All functional requirements set to the design are considered fulfilled to a reasonable degree. The methods applied for the design have weaknesses. Flaws in the RBSD methodology include a lack of accurate statistical information, the fact that the method is based on analysis of existing vessels, and that it is dependent on predetermined risk acceptance criteria. Flaws in the SBSD methodology include non existing statistical information on small and/or <b>autonomous</b> <b>vessels.</b> Required space for all systems was therefore set using existing equipment. Another flaw is that functional requirements may not cover all actual requirements for the vessel. For instance, bollards and ropes are required on board in case towing is necessary, but is not covered by any functional requirements. The iterative nature of the design process indicate several relevant tasks for the further project work. It will be relevant to consider all aspects set by regulations. New aspects for consideration include design of land based dock systems and determination of access restrictions, required safety level, disclaimer of liability and technical requirements for <b>autonomous</b> <b>vessels.</b> Several aspects on board the vessel are also relevant. This includes heating cables in the ferry roof and main deck, verification of plate thickness, hull adaptation for welding and design of bicycle racks. The operational plan for the battery systems should be determined for the ferry operation to run as smoothly as possible. Finally, the damage stability for the vessel should be verified...|$|E

40|$|The {{study is}} {{performed}} with the purpose to connect the economic consequences from the MUNIN project and DNV GL’s financial analyzes with the present costs for a conventional vessel. The idea is to observe if unmanned <b>autonomous</b> <b>vessels</b> has the possibility to reduce costs for a shipping company or if it contributes with additional costs. This due to the reason that shipping companies within the container- and bulk segment have difficulties to present profit. The two separate research projects are compared to gain a perception of their amplitude. The progress with autonomy and its technical systems within the shipping industry is compared with competitive industries where several projects within the subject are in progress. According to financial analyzes for ReVolt and the MUNIN project the implementation of autonomous systems is a profitable business. Calculations from the MUNIN-project shows that they will save 7 million USD {{during a period of}} 25 years when the vessel is operated with heavy fuel oil and ReVolt achieves a saving of 48 million USD under a period of 30 years. In the scenario when the MUNIN vessel is operated with marine diesel oil, the result will exceed the cost for a conventional vessel with 29. 7 million USD. Communication costs, for sending data between the vessel and a shore control centre, has been produced and applied to the financial assays and it has changed the outcome significantly. The 48 million USD cost savings for ReVolt is reduced to 32 million USD due to current fuel prices and with communication- and personnel costs for the SCC the total costs for ReVolt will exceed the conventional vessel with 3. 95 million USD. The communication costs for the MUNIN vessel is not allowed to exceed 280. 000 USD per year if the implementation of autonomous systems shall be profitable. The scenario of communication costs for the MUNIN vessel is a great assumption but compared to their own calculation, which is not included in their financial analysis, the outcome is positive. Despite this, the communication costs per year exceed 280. 000 USD per year and can thereby be found that the economic outcome for the MUNIN projects autonomous vessel will be less profitable than the conventional vessel. A positive fact that speaks for these two concepts is that it is the communication costs that has a negative effect on the result. Communication costs will decrease with time due to the fact of the technical development and therefore a potential within this segment exists...|$|E
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{unmanned}} merchant vessels are possible, and researchers have claimed that larger <b>autonomous</b> <b>vessels</b> can be seen within 10 years. For oceangoing vessels, {{one of the biggest}} challenges is to get systems and machinery to work reliably for up to 4 weeks without maintenance. Therefore, a need to identify the systems that can be solely maintained in port, and those systems that will require redesign is present. Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) is a procedure that determines what must be done to ensure that any physical asset continuous to do whatever its users wants it to do in its present operating context. The procedure is a thorough process that identifies critical failures for an asset in its operating context, and determines whether maintenance tasks can reduce the risk to an acceptable level. If no maintenance tasks are found to be applicable and effective in the operating context, the process requires one-time changes, such as redesign, modification or change of the item s operating context. For an oceangoing merchant vessel that is to be used in a new operating context, where no maintenance will be possible for up to four weeks, the procedure can be used to identify the critical failures and whether the risk can be reduced by means of maintenance, or if one-time changes are necessary. In this thesis, those critical failures that cannot be managed effectively by maintenance has been defined as barriers. This thesis establishes a step-by-step procedure for how to use RCM principles for identification of barriers. The procedure is considered to be a very useful tool for identifying and breaking barriers in design of unmanned engine rooms for merchant vessels. However, to effectively and successfully perform the procedure, a group consisting of an RCM facilitator well versed in RCM principles and experts with in-depth knowledge about the systems is strongly recommended. The procedure is used in a case study to identify barriers in a fuel oil system that uses HFO, as this is the most common fuel used today on oceangoing merchant vessels. The analysis has been performed on the fuel system under normal seagoing conditions, and the functional failure analysed is Supplies no fuel to the engine. As the RCM process only focuses on the maintenance, other procedures the crew may have such as opening and closing of hand-operated valves falls outside of the scope. Four barriers were identified in the analysis: plugging of the by-pass filter, plugging of the ME automatic backflush filter, plugging of the transfer pump filter and plugging of the flowmeter filter. These failure modes are identified as barriers because cleaning of the filters too often are required less than 4 weeks after the last cleaning. As the operating context states that maintenance cannot be performed at intervals less than 4 weeks, and the risk is considered to be unacceptable, the failures are considered to be barriers. The conclusion is therefore that one-time changes such as redesign, modification or change of operating context for the fuel system is necessary in order for an oceangoing merchant vessel to be able to sail without maintenance personnel with an acceptable risk. As the frequency of cleaning tasks are a direct function of the condition of the fuel, a one-time change that can be effective on all identified barriers is change of fuel. A comparison made with an FMECA analysis from a vessel running on diesel fuel indicate that this will have a significant effect...|$|E

These <b>autonomous</b> surface <b>vessel</b> technologies enable missions and tasks to be performed without the direction of human operators, and have changed the way scientists and engineers approach problems. Because these robotic devices can work without manned guidance, they can execute missions that are too difficult, dangerous, expensive, or tedious for human operators to attempt. The United States government is currently expanding the use of <b>autonomous</b> surface <b>vessel</b> technologies through the United States Navy's Spartan Scout unmanned surface vessel (USV) and NASA's Ocean-Atmosphere Sensor Integration System (OASIS) USV. These USVs are well-suited to complete monotonous, dangerous, and time-consuming missions. The USVs provide better performance, lower cost, and reduced risk to human life than manned systems. In this thesis, we explore how to plan multiple USV observation schedules for two significant notional observation scenarios, collecting water temperatures ahead of {{the path of a}} hurricane, and collecting fluorometer readings to observe and track a harmful algal bloom. (cont.) A control system must be in place that coordinates a fleet of USVs to targets in an efficient manner. We develop three algorithms to solve the unmanned surface vehicle observation-planning problem. A greedy construction heuristic runs fastest, but produces suboptimal plans; a 3 -phase algorithm which combines a greedy construction heuristic with an improvement phase and an insertion phase, requires more execution time, but generates significantly better plans; an optimal mixed integer programming algorithm produces optimal plans, but can only solve small problem instances. by John V.

The proposal to “snapshot” RAIM (Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring) method for GNSS receivers mounted on SUAV operating in poor space segment geometry is presented in the paper. Existing “snapshot” RAIM methods and algorithms which are used in practical applications have been developed for airborne receivers, thus two main assumptions have been made. The first one is that the geometry of visible satellites is strong. It means that the exclusion of any satellite from the positioning solution don’t cause significant deterioration of Dilution of Precision (DOP) coefficients. The second one is that only one outlier could appear in pseudorange measurements. In case of SUAV operating in harbour these two assumptions cannot be accepted. Because of their small dimensions, GNSS antenna is only a few decimetres above sea level and regular ships, buildings and harbour facilities block and reflect satellite signals. Thus, different approach to “snapshot” RAIM is necessary.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in automation, robotics and artificial intelligence {{have given a}} push to a wider usage of these technologies in recent years, and nowadays, driverless transport systems are already state-of-the-art on certain legs of transportation. This has given a push for the maritime industry to join the advancement. The case organisation, AAWA initiative, is a joint industry-academia research consortium {{with the objective of}} developing readiness for the first commercial autonomous solutions, exploiting state-of-the-art autonomous and remote technology. The initiative develops both autonomous and remote operation technology for navigation, machinery, and all on-board operating systems. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a model with which to estimate and forecast the operational costs, and thus enable comparisons between manned and <b>autonomous</b> cargo <b>vessels.</b> The building process of the model is also described and discussed. Furthermore, the model’s aim is to track and identify the critical success factors of the chosen ship design, and to enable monitoring and tracking of the incurred operational costs as the life cycle of the vessel progresses. The study adopts the constructive research approach, as the aim is to develop a construct to meet the needs of a case organisation. Data has been collected through discussions and meeting with consortium members and researchers, as well as through written and internal communications material. The model itself is built using activity-based life cycle costing, which enables both realistic cost estimation and forecasting, as well as the identification of critical success factors due to the process-orientation adopted from activity-based costing and the statistical nature of Monte Carlo simulation techniques. As the model was able to meet the multiple aims set for it, and the case organisation was satisfied with it, it could be argued that activity-based life cycle costing is the method with which to conduct cost estimation and forecasting in the case of <b>autonomous</b> cargo <b>vessels.</b> The model was able to perform the cost analysis and forecasting, as well as to trace the critical success factors. Later on, it also enabled, albeit hypothetically, monitoring and tracking of the incurred costs. By collecting costs this way, it was argued that the activity-based LCC model is able facilitate learning from and continuous improvement of the <b>autonomous</b> <b>vessel.</b> As with the building process of the model, an individual approach was chosen, while still using the implementation and model building steps presented in existing literature. This was due to two factors: the nature of the model and – perhaps even more importantly – the nature of the case organisation. Furthermore, the loosely organised network structure means that knowing the case organisation and its aims is of great importance when conducting a constructive research...|$|R
40|$|A Fuzzy {{logic control}} law is {{presented}} and implemented {{for trajectory tracking}} of multiple under actuated <b>autonomous</b> surface <b>vessels.</b> In this study, an individual unmanned ship is {{used to be the}} leader that tracks the desired path; other unmanned ships are used to be the followers which track the leader only by using its position. A fuzzy controller was implemented for the ship leader position with a constant velocity; however, the ship follower needed a fuzzy controller for the position and the forward velocity. Simulation results show that the fuzzy method presents an interesting robustness against the environmental disturbances and effective tracking results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper works towards {{autonomous}} lakeshore monitor-ing, {{which involves}} long–term operation over a large–scale, natural en-vironment. Natural environments widely vary in appearance over time, which reduces {{the effectiveness of}} many appearance–based data asso-ciation techniques. Rather than perform monitoring using appearance– based features, we are investigating whether the lakeshore geometry can provide a stable feature for this task. We have deployed an <b>autonomous</b> surface <b>vessel</b> 30 times over a duration of 8 months. This paper describes our initial analyses of this data, including our work towards a full simul-taneous localization and mapping system and the shortcomings of using appearance–based features...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObstacles {{avoidance}} of <b>Autonomous</b> Surface <b>Vessel</b> (ASV) in riverine environment is challenging since the motion space is {{constrained by the}} unstructured riverbanks, especially for the track keeping cruise task. This paper proposes a balance-Artificial Potential Field (APF) hybrid method to realize the ASV track-keeping and obstacles avoidance. The balance scheme {{is to keep the}} ASV cruise in the center of river while the Artificial Potential Field method is to avoid obstacles. The simulation results show that this approach is efficient for ASV navigation and successfully avoid obstacles in challenging situations, such as narrow passage and S-shape avoidance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Following the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) approach, we have modeled and {{implemented}} a planar trajectory planning and tracking controller designed for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles or <b>Autonomous</b> Surface <b>Vessels</b> (AUVs/ASVs). Our approach covers steps {{such as the}} requirement, analysis, design and implementation to model and realize a controller for most standard AUV/ASV platforms. It also allows the designed elements to be customizable and re-usable {{in the development of}} new applications of AUV/ASV controllers. The paper describes step-by-step the development lifecycle of planar trajectory-tracking controller for AUVs/ASVs. Based on this approach, a horizontal trajectory-tracking controller of a miniature autonomous submerged vehicle is completely developed and successfully taken on trial trip...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{positioning}} control of of a small size <b>autonomous</b> surface <b>vessel</b> (ASV) {{that can be used}} to carry a multitude of payload systems, including acoustic devices for underwater positioning and for communications with autonomous underwater vehicles. Its main motivation is the development of highly operational systems, by replacing typically moored support infrastructures with others that can dynamically position themselves. This work covers the design of feedback control laws that assure that the underactuated surface vessel Zarco can keep its position even in the presence of water currents and wind, and without special sensors to estimate such disturbances. Experimental results showing the performance of the designed control laws are also shown...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of unmanned, <b>autonomous</b> merchant <b>vessels</b> is {{investigated by the}} EU project MUNIN (Maritime Unmanned Navigation through Intelligence in Networks). The ships will be manned during passage to and from port and unmanned during ocean-passage. When unmanned, the ships will be controlled by an automatic system informed by onboard sensors allowing the ship to make standard collision avoidance manoeuvres according to international regulation. The ship will be continuously monitored by a remote shore centre able to take remote control should the automatic systems falter. For the humans in the shore control centre the usual problems of automations remains {{as well as a}} pronounced problem of keeping up adequate situation awareness through remote sensing...|$|R
40|$|An <b>autonomous</b> <b>vessel,</b> the Offshore Sensing Sailbuoy, {{was used}} for wave {{measurements}} near the Ekofisk oil platform complex in the North Sea (56. 5 N, 3. 2 E, operated by ConocoPhilllips) from 6 to 20 November 2015. Being 100 % wind propelled, the Sailbuoy has two-way communication via the Iridium network and has the capability for missions of six months or more. It has previously been deployed in the Arctic, Norwegian Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, {{but this was the}} first real test for wave measurements. During the campaign it held position about 20 km northeast of Ekofisk (on the lee side) during rough conditions. Mean wind speed measured at Ekofisk during the campaign was near 9. 8 m/s, with a maximum of 20. 4 m/s, with wind mostly from south and south west. A Datawell MOSE G 1000 GPS based 2 Hz wave sensor was mounted on the Sailbuoy. Mean significant wave height (Hs 1 hr) measured was 3 m, whereas maximum Hs was 6 m. Mean wave period was 7. 7 s, while maximum wave height, Hmax, was 12. 6 m. These measurements have been compared with non-directional Waverider observations at the Ekofisk complex. Mean Hs at Ekofisk was 3. 1 m, while maximum Hs was 6. 5 m. Nevertheless, the correlation between the two measurements was high (97 %). Spectra comparison was also good, except for low Hs (~ 1 m), where the motion of the vessel seemed to influence the measurements. Nevertheless, the Sailbuoy performed well during this campaign, and results suggests that it is a suitable platform for wave measurements in rather rough sea conditions...|$|R
