Marge observes that Ralph has a vivid {{imagination}} and learns that he has no friends to play with; she arranges a play-date for Ralph to spend time with a horrified Bart.|$|E
5|$|Juliet {{arrives at}} an airport with her sister, where Richard Alpert and Ethan Rom <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> escort her {{the rest of the}} way. Juliet says good-bye to her sister, Rachel, {{promising}} to be back before her baby is born. In the airport terminal, Alpert pours sedative into a glass of orange juice and gives it to Juliet to drink, explaining that the trip is very intense. Juliet is wary of drinking the juice, even though she is okay with the other circumstances surrounding the trip. Alpert interrupts and tells her the place she is going is very special and that she has a gift with which she is supposed to do something significant. Juliet drinks the orange juice and passes out. She wakes up in a submarine with her arms and waist strapped down for safety.|$|E
5|$|Sam Jones III was {{the last}} of the season one series regulars to be cast–being hired just four days before filming for the pilot episode began. Jones, who is African American, was also cast against the Superman mythology where Pete Ross is Caucasian. Jones has stated that he would have {{understood}} if the producers had simply created a black character for him to portray, but the fact that they chose to go with him, even though the character has always been white, gave him more honor {{to be a part of}} the show. During the first season, Jones felt like he should have more screen time, but later conceded that the show was about Clark's journey and that the other characters <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> help his story move along.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} week, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) spots her ex-boyfriend Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) {{talking to}} Marsden; Jack tells Ronnie {{that he was}} fishing for information. With no new leads, Marsden's boss threatens to take her off the case. She reviews the suspects and decides to question Jack, since he is asking more questions than he has answered. In the café Marsden and Hughes discuss new information she has obtained, ensuring that she is overheard. Chinese whisper-style rumours circulate, ending with the certainty that Marsden would arrest Ronnie. Ronnie sees Marsden in the Square, and a struggle ensues. She knocks Marsden down, is {{arrested and charged with}} assaulting a police officer but is released on bail. Marsden suspects Ronnie further, saying that she has now shown her true colours. Later, DC Jasmine Field (Karen Ascoe) enters the pub with other officers to arrest a suspect; frightened, Ronnie leaves Walford. The police officers <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> arrest Dot Branning (June Brown), who was accused by Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin) after Dot slapped her. Jack confronts Marsden for unnecessarily sending a uniformed officer to arrest Dot and unsettling the locals, and realises there was no new information.|$|E

Overt marked cars may have CCTV cameras mounted on the roof to discourage wrongdoing, whereas unmarked cars would have them hidden inside. This type of vehicle is particularly common in the United Kingdom. In the United States, some police departments' vice, narcotics, and gang suppression units utilize vehicles that contain no identifiable police equipment (such as lights, sirens or radios) to conduct covert surveillance.|$|E
25|$|The main {{official}} at the wrestling match is the referee, who is in full control in matters of judgement at the competition and is responsible for starting and stopping the match; observing all holds; signaling points; calling penalties such as illegal holds, unnecessary roughness, fleeing the mat, or flagrant misconduct; and finally observing a full view of and determining the fall. There can also be one assistant referee (especially at tournaments) that helps the referee with making any difficult decisions and in preventing error. Also, scorers <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> record the points of the two individual wrestlers. Finally, a match or meet timekeeper with assistant timekeepers are present to note the match time, timeouts, and time advantage {{and work with the}} scorers.|$|E
25|$|The Village of Wish: This is {{the tiny}} town of Wish, where Lyra lives with her parents, Fidget and Faye, and her grandparents, Tangle and Aeval. It’s an insular place, far from cities and civilization. The town is {{surrounded}} by tall walls, not to keep the residents inside, for they have no desire to leave the safety and warmth of their community. The walls <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> keep the outside world outside, and are secured with complex weighted locks first seen in Dream Chronicles. The streets are cobbled, lined with colorful dwellings and stores. Beyond the walls of Wish lie lush forests and winding roads that, eventually, lead to other larger towns. But the folk of Wish have little desire to visit those distant places. Their homes are secure in their beloved village where, they believe, no harm can come to them.|$|E

25|$|The Hawaiians’ ways of {{learning}} include wide keen {{attention from the}} children while adults are available for guidance, {{also found in the}} model of Learning by Observing and Pitching In. Children were found to learn from adults by participating in group activities where they had the chance to observe the performance of more experienced participants as well as having errors in their own performance corrected by more seasoned group members. Because the children learn through observation, and then are encouraged to practice among their peers, we can speculate the children have keen attention to events around them, which is an expectation of adults and community members who <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> assist when needed. It has been observed that Hawaiian children were successful at completing tasks which greatly depend on visual and memory process skills, which coincides with Hawaiian mother’s frequent use of non-verbal communication.|$|E

The later Muslim Moroccan Berber traveler Ibn Batutta (13041377) wrote about many of his travel experiences in places across the Eurasian world, including China at the farthest eastern extremity. After describing lavish Chinese ships holding palatial cabins and saloons, along with the life of Chinese ship crews and captains, Batutta wrote: [...] "Among the inhabitants of China {{there are those who}} own numerous ships, on which they send their agents to foreign places. For nowhere in the world <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> be found people richer than the Chinese".|$|E

500|$|Messick {{said they}} {{designed}} [...] "a fairy tale, mythological fantasy world" [...] {{that feels like}} it happened long time ago but is not set in any particular time period. Marlene Stewart created the film's costumes, using traditional leather and linen but without an antique look. Its steampunk-like, retro-futuristic weapons were created by the weapon designer Simon Boucherie and Wirkola, who said they wanted Hansel and Gretel's weapons {{to look as if}} the characters hand-made them. Wirkola stated he [...] "just wanted this crazy, mashed-up world where you can’t pinpoint where it is, or when it is" [...] and the modern elements <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> [...] "add to the fun and tone of the film." [...] He said, [...] "We wanted the movie to feel timeless and for the movie to feel like a fairy tale, but still grounded. It {{was a lot of fun}} coming up with the different weapon designs and ways of killing witches. We mixed old and new elements. But no matter how modern some of the weapons are, they all have an old-fashioned feel and look like they could fit into this world." ...|$|E
500|$|Red Dead Redemption {{required}} {{a large amount}} of voice work in order to feel alive. The team felt that the amount of voice work required for Redemption had been previously achieved in Grand Theft Auto IV, with prior experience to such amounts dating back to [...] (2004) and Bully (2006). To cast the characters, the team held auditions; until actors were officially signed to the project, it was only known as an [...] "untitled video game project", for secrecy. In the game, Rob Wiethoff portrayed John Marston, Jim Bently portrayed Edgar Ross, Steve J. Palmer portrayed Bill Williamson, Benjamin Byron Davis portrayed Dutch van der Linde, Kimberly Irion portrayed Bonnie MacFarlane, and Josh Blaylock portrayed Jack Marston. Rockstar displayed care {{in the direction of the}} voice work for the game; full-time specialist directors were employed to ensure success in the game's dialogue. The performances of the actors were mostly recorded using motion capture technology, with additional dialogue and sound effects recorded in a studio. In Red Dead Redemption, the team wanted to create a story that mixed with the game's mechanics to result in a fun and organic experience. As the story developed, a range of characters were organically created based on the period. [...] "The stories <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> serve the game," [...] Houser explained.|$|E
500|$|The Millennium Earl {{has been}} well {{received}} by manga, anime and other publications. Reviewing the manga's first volume, A. E. Sparrow of IGN compared him to three of Batmans villains: Penguin, the Joker and Two-Face, finding those similarities appealing. Additionally, Sparrow called the Millennium Earl a [...] "menacing villain you'll love to hate". Ross Liversidge of UK Anime Network also enjoyed the character, praising his changing design and villainous deeds. Sheena McNeil agreed, saying that the Earl works well as the series' villain with his [...] "loving tone {{as indicated by the}} hearts in his speech bubbles and his perpetual grin, both of which <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> make him all the more sinister by masking his true nature". Tom Tonhat of the Escapist also praised the Earl's modus operandi of reviving the dead as Akuma, seeing it as a strong theme that allows viewers to symphatize with his victims. He also noted that the character's initial appearance as [...] "nonthreatening as a portly gentleman clown" [...] made his actions more hateful. Todd Douglass, Jr. of DVD Talk called the Earl's transformation of humans into Akuma [...] "fiendish". Lynzee Loveridge of Anime News Network included him on the website's [...] "7 Clowns to Haunt Your Nightmares" [...] list. Erin Finnegan of ANN found the character enigmatic because he [...] "hangs out in an extra-dimensional space with randomly floating jack-o'-lanterns" [...] and compared him to Mad Pierrot from the Cowboy Bebop anime series.|$|E
