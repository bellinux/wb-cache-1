Methods This was an ecological study that modelled the Standardised Mortality Ratio (SMR) for lung cancer in 8073 Spanish towns over the period 1994 – 2003. Population exposure to industrial pollution was estimated on the basis of distance from town of residence to pollution source. An exploratory, near-versus-far analysis was conducted, using mixed Poisson regression models and an analysis of the effect of municipal proximity within a 50 -kilometre radius of each of the 18 installations. Results Results varied for the different facilities. In two instances there was an increasing mortality gradient with proximity to the installation, though this was exclusively observed among men. Conclusion The study of cancer mortality in areas surrounding pollutant foci is a useful tool for environmental surveillance, and serves to highlight areas of interest susceptible to being investigated by <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>studies.</b> Despite present limitations, recognition is therefore due to the advance represented by publication of the EPER and the study of pollutant foci. </p...|$|E

Methods. Sequential peripheral blood leukocyte samples from 74 pregnant women and 29 nonpregnant individuals with primary infection were examined for HCMV-specific CD 4 + T cells by cytokine flow cytometry (CFC) and lymphoproliferative response (LPR) analysis. Immunological results for 19 transmitter and 21 non-transmitter mothers were compared. Results.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis research investigated {{the development and}} use of an analytical assessment methodology anchored in systems engineering principles, affordance theory, and human abilities, to measure the potential of integrated training environments (ITEs) to effectively support training. Empirical investigation of ITEs is costly, lacks formal guidance, and is therefore often unreliable. <b>Ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>studies,</b> commissioned by individual organizations, constitute the current state of Army ITE evaluation. These assessments are often entirely based on subject matter expert judgment through surveys, which produce results that are linked indirectly and loosely to the ITEs. What is required is a repeatable, inexpensive, analytical approach to ITE assessment that bounds the potential of a given system to the support it provides to the deliberate practice of specific tasks. The results of this research include the {{development and use of}} the integrated training environment assessment methodology (ITEAM).

40|$|In this paper, {{the role}} of trees on {{airborne}} pollutant dispersion in a real neighborhood in Pamplona (Spain) is discussed. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is employed and evaluated against concentrations measured during {{the last part of}} winter season at a monitoring station located in the study area. Aerodynamic and deposition effects of trees are jointly considered, which has only been done in few recent studies. Specifically, the impact on NOx concentration of: (a) tree-foliage; and (b) introducing new vegetation in a tree-free street is analyzed considering several deposition velocities and Leaf Area Densities (LAD) to model deciduous and evergreen vegetation. Results show that the higher the LAD, the higher the deposition (concentration reduction) and the blocking aerodynamic effect (concentration increase). Regardless of foliage or deposition rates, results suggest the predominance of aerodynamic effects which induce concentration increases up to a maximum of 7. 2 %, while deposition induces concentration decreases up to a maximum of 6. 9 %. The inclusion of new trees in one street modifies the distribution of pollutant, not only in that street, but also in nearby locations with concentration increase or decrease. This finding suggests that planting trees in street with traffic as an air pollution reduction strategy seems to be not appropriate in general, highlighting the necessity of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>studies</b> for each particular case to select the suitable location of new vegetation...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{hypothesized}} that cholesterol content is {{increased in the}} circulating erythrocytes of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and may be a marker of clinical instability. We therefore sought to investigate whether cholesterol content differs in erythrocyte membranes of patients presenting with ACS {{compared to patients with}} chronic stable angina (CSA). BackgroundPlaque rupture in ACS depends at least partly on the volume of the necrotic lipid core. Histopathologic studies have suggested that cholesterol transported by erythrocytes and deposited into the necrotic core of atheromatous plaques contributes to lipid core growth. MethodsConsecutive angina patients were prospectively assessed; 120 had CSA (83 men, age 64 ± 11 years) and 92 ACS (67 men, 66 ± 11 years). Total cholesterol content in erythrocyte membranes (CEM) was measured using an enzymatic assay, and protein content was assessed by the Bradford method. ResultsThe CEM (median and interquartile range) was higher (p < 0. 001) in ACS patients (184 μg/mg; range 130. 4 to 260. 4 μg/mg) compared with CSA patients (81. 1 μg/mg; range 53. 9 to 109. 1 μg/mg) (analysis of covariance). Total plasma cholesterol concentrations did not correlate with CEM levels (r = − 0. 046, p = 0. 628). ConclusionsThis study shows, for the first time, that CEM is significantly higher in patients with ACS compared with CSA patients. These findings suggest a potential role of CEM as a marker of atheromatous plaque growth and vulnerability.

40|$|G. Pascale ’ Foundation, I- 80131 Naples, Italy A {{number of}} {{xenobiotics}} require redox reactions {{to form the}} reactive intermediates involved in the ultimate toxic events (e. g., adduct formation). The same mechanisms lead {{to the formation of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can themselves exert direct toxicity including, e. g., DNA oxidative damage or glutathione depletion. The occurence of both mechanistic features in xenobiotic activation and toxicity may raise some difficulties in ascertaining the respective roles of reactive intermediates versus ROS-related mechnisms. An example is provided by the toxicity mechanisms of mitomycin C (MMC) and diepoxybutane (DEB), which are commonly referred to as `cross-linkers’. Their toxic actions, however, are well-known to be modulated via redox parameters, such as oxygen tension, antioxidants levels, or thioredoxin overexpression. The diagnostic assessment of Fanconi’s anaemia (FA) relies on MMC and DEB sensitivity, which is usually referred to as `cross-linker sensitivity’; thus the redox-dependent toxic-ities of MMC and DEB may have direct implications for the definition of FA phenotype. Another major aspect in ROS formation relies on the extensive evidence pointing to the requirement for oxidative, aswell as nitrosative activities in triggering a number of key events in cell division and differentiation, and in early embryogenesis. In turn, anti-oxidants that may prevent ROS-associated cellular damage in adult cells may prove to exert adverse or fatal outcomes when administered in early life stages. The overall information available on xenobiotic redox biotransforma-tion andon the physiopathological roles of ROS points to the need of addressing <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>studies</b> that should take into account the multiplicity of mechanistic events invol...|$|E
40|$|Many {{reports have}} been {{recently}} {{published on the}} accuracy of mental distress detection by general practitioners. Recognition of 'caseness', irrespective of its accuracy, nevertheless determines the implementation of therapeutic interventions. This paper reports {{the results of a}} naturalistic study describing the consequences for the patients of being identified as 'cases' in the general practice (in terms of referral strategies at recruitment and outcome 3 months and 1 year later), in the context of care provision generated by the 1978 Italian psychiatric reform. Sixty-eight GPs recruited 878 'cases' according to implicit criteria. Overall 20 % of the patients were referred the psychiatric setting; only half of these for psychiatric care. After 3 months and 1 year from recruitment respectively 12 % and 23 % of the subjects were no longer 'cases'. The factors contributing to predict the outcome at three months were age, symptom duration, comorbidity, presence of social context risk factors and prior psychiatric history (or presence of 'major' symptoms); after one year the predictors of caseness were caseness status at 3 months, and clinical severity, symptom duration and presence of somatization at recruitment. GPs remain the main care providers in the short- and long-term. The results of the study indicate the need for a reappraisal of the emphasis to be put on caseness recognition and on the development of standardized instruments for the identification of mental distress.
