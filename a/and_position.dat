The actuator accelerations, velocities <b>and</b> <b>positions</b> of the current sampling interval are stored for use during the next sampling interval...|$|R

40|$|Abstract— 3 D {{tracking}} <b>and</b> <b>positioning</b> {{of surgical}} instruments is an indispensable part of virtual Surgery training system, {{because it is}} the unique interface for trainee to communicate with virtual environment. A suit of 3 D tracking <b>and</b> <b>positioning</b> of surgical instruments based on stereoscopic vision is proposed. It can capture spatial movements of simulated surgical instrument in real time, and provide 6 degree of freedom information with the absolute error of less than 1 mm. The experimental results show that the 3 D tracking <b>and</b> <b>positioning</b> of surgical instruments is highly accurate, easily operated, and inexpensive. Combining with force sensor and embedded acquisition device, this 3 D tracking <b>and</b> <b>positioning</b> method {{can be used as a}} measurement platform of physical parameters to realize the measurement of soft tissue parameters.

40|$|Purpose: Market {{orientation}} <b>and</b> <b>positioning</b> {{have been}} widely recognized as organizational metrics linked to hotel performance. This study offered empirical evidence on the relationship among market orientation, <b>positioning,</b> <b>and</b> hotel performance in Ghana’s (luxury) hotel sector. It also reports on the joint effect of market orientation <b>and</b> <b>positioning</b> on hotel performance in the same sector. Design/methodology/approach: Three hypotheses were investigated {{on the relationship between}} market orientation <b>and</b> hotel performance; <b>positioning</b> <b>and</b> hotel performance; and the joint effect of market orientation <b>and</b> <b>positioning</b> on hotel performance. A survey of star rated (luxury) hotels in the capital city of Ghana was used. One hundred and five (105) responses were used in the analysis. Descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis and hierarchical regression were used to test the three (3) hypotheses. Findings: All hypotheses were accepted. Market orientation <b>and</b> <b>positioning</b> jointly affect hotel performance, and the study provides hotel managers with suggestions on to enhance their performance via market orientation <b>and</b> <b>positioning.</b> Research limitations/implications: Management perspectives on market orientation, <b>positioning</b> <b>and</b> hotel performance were sought to the exclusion of customers. Future studies may consider using customer perspectives as well. Practical implications: Hotels should consider adopting market oriented positioning strategies to improve on their performance. Originality/value: This study {{is one of the few}} attempts to systematically investigating the intertwined concepts of market orientation, <b>positioning</b> <b>and</b> performance in a developing economy hospitality context...|$|R

However, adverse reaction to the clock's size <b>and</b> <b>position</b> provoked the club into ordering a larger replacement to be incorporated in a proposed big screen.|$|E

5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and marbled newts. Males are territorial and use leks, or courtship arenas, small {{patches of}} clear ground where they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, {{they use the}} same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; marbled newts seem more aggressive than crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try to guide the female away from their rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her <b>and</b> <b>position</b> {{himself in front of}} her. After this first orientation phase, courtship proceeds with display and spermatophore transfer.|$|E
