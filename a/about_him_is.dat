5|$|In the Quadrigae Tyrannorum (Four tyrants: The Lives of Firmus, Saturninus, Proculus and Bonosus), {{the author}} {{includes}} Firmus, {{said to have}} been a usurper in Egypt under Aurelian. There is no certainty that this person ever existed; however, there was a Corrector named Claudius Firmus stationed in Egypt in 274, about the time Zosimus states that Aurelian was dealing with some trouble in that province. Nevertheless, the History's wealth of detail <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> considered to be completely invented. For example, he would eat an ostrich a day, he had a carriage drawn by ostriches, he would swim among crocodiles, he built himself a house fitted with square panels of glass.|$|E
25|$|The Jarrahids were {{mentioned}} in the sources in 1065/66, when Hassan's nephews Hazim ibn Ali and Humayd ibn Mahmud likely backed Abd al-Sharif ibn Abi'l Jann {{in his attempt to}} wrest control of Damascus from the troops of Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali. Afterward, the nephews were captured and jailed in Cairo. Their release was requested by the Fatimid general and descendant of the Hamdanids, Nasir al-Dawla ibn Hamdan, in 1066/67. Hazim had sons named Badr and Rabi'a. According to Syrian historian Mustafa A. Hiyari, information on Rabi'a in the medieval sources is confused, though he most likely was an emir of Bedouin auxiliaries for the Burid ruler of Damascus, Toghtekin (r. 1103–1128). Nothing more <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> {{mentioned in the}} sources, but the military activities of his sons, Mira and Fadl, are noted. His other sons were Daghfal, Thabit and Faraj.|$|E

25|$|Why did Hipparchus need a {{lunar eclipse}} {{to measure the}} {{position}} of a star? The equinoctial points are not marked in the sky, so he needed the Moon as a reference point. Hipparchus already had developed a way to calculate the longitude of the Sun at any moment. A lunar eclipse happens during Full moon, when the Moon is in opposition. At the midpoint of the eclipse, the Moon is precisely 180° from the Sun. Hipparchus is thought to have measured the longitudinal arc separating Spica from the Moon. To this value, he added the calculated longitude of the Sun, plus 180° for the longitude of the Moon. He did the same procedure with Timocharis' data (Evans 1998, p.251). Observations such as these eclipses, incidentally, are the main source of data about when Hipparchus worked, since other biographical information <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> minimal. The lunar eclipses he observed, for instance, took place on April 21, 146 BC, and March 21, 135 BC (Toomer 1984, p.135 n. 14).|$|E
500|$|Christopher Nolan, {{director}} of the Batman movie The Dark Knight, has said that Vicious inspired the characterisation of The Joker, played by Heath Ledger.

This commitment to anarchy, this commitment to chaos." [...] Ledger's costar Christian Bale has claimed that Ledger drew inspiration from watching tapes of Vicious.|$|E

In London he had practiced as a decorator. John Rosen—real name John Zelin or Tzelin—came to London in 1909 from Riga and worked as a barber, while another member of the gang was Max Smoller, also known as Joe Levi and [...] "Josepf the Jew". He was wanted in his native Crimea for several jewel robberies.|$|E

500|$|Before the Thraliana, Thrale kept {{two sets}} of anecdotes: the first was devoted to Samuel Johnson {{and the other for}} {{miscellaneous}} events. She relied on these, along with her memory, to write the early portions of her work. Boswell, when trying to find information for his own work, wrote: [...] "Mr. Thrale told me, I am not sure what day, that there is a Book of Johnsoniana kept int heir Family, in which all Mr. Johnson's sayings and all that they can collect <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> put down ... I must try to get this Thralian Miscellany, to assist me in writing Mr. Johnson's Life, if Mrs. Thrale does not intend to do it herself." [...] After Johnson's death, Thrale used the Thraliana to create the Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson (1786). The manuscript passed through many hands and was owned by A. Edward Newton until his death in autumn 1940. The Thraliana was eventually published in 1942, and it was produced by the Clarendon Press in England while its editor, Katharine Balderston, was prohibited from travelling across the ocean from Wellesley College because of World War II.|$|E

500|$|Rampersad {{suggests}} that Haley understood autobiographies as [...] "almost fiction". In [...] "The Color of His Eyes: Bruce Perry's Malcolm and Malcolm's Malcolm", Rampersad criticizes Perry's biography, Malcolm: The Life of a Man Who Changed Black America, {{and makes the}} general point that {{the writing of the}} Autobiography is part of the narrative of blackness in the 20th century and consequently should [...] "not be held utterly beyond inquiry". To Rampersad, the Autobiography is about psychology, ideology, a conversion narrative, and the myth-making process. [...] "Malcolm inscribed in it the terms of his understanding of the form even as the unstable, even treacherous form concealed and distorted particular aspects of his quest. But there is no Malcolm untouched by doubt or fiction. Malcolm's Malcolm is in itself a fabrication; the 'truth' <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> impossible to know." [...] Rampersad {{suggests that}} since his 1965 assassination, MalcolmX has [...] "become the desires of his admirers, who have reshaped memory, historical record and the autobiography according to their wishes, which is to say, according to their needs as they perceive them." [...] Further, Rampersad says, many admirers of MalcolmX perceive [...] "accomplished and admirable" [...] figures like Martin Luther King, Jr., and W. E. B. DuBois inadequate to fully express black humanity as it struggles with oppression, [...] "while Malcolm is seen as the apotheosis of black individual greatness ... he is a perfect hero—his wisdom is surpassing, his courage definitive, his sacrifice messianic". Rampersad suggests that devotees have helped shape the myth of MalcolmX.|$|E

500|$|Grant's [...] "immaculate comic performance" [...] (BBC) as the trust-funded womaniser, Will Freeman, in {{the film}} {{adaptation}} of Nick Hornby's best-selling novel About a Boy received raves from critics. Almost universally praised, with an Academy Award-nominated screenplay, About a Boy (2002) {{was determined by the}} Washington Post to be [...] "that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure, prickly independence over fetishised coupledom, and honesty over typical Hollywood endings." [...] Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "The acid comedy of Grant's performance carries the film [...] gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs," [...] while Roger Ebert observed that [...] "the Cary Grant department is understaffed, and Hugh Grant shows here that he is more than a star, he is a resource." [...] Released a day after the blockbuster , About a Boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful Grant films, making all of $129million globally. The film earned Grant his third Golden-Globe nomination, while the London Film Critics Circle named Grant its Best British Actor and GQ honoured him as one of the magazine's men of the year 2006. [...] "His performance {{can only be described as}} revelatory," [...] wrote critic Ann Hornaday, adding that [...] "Grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire, terror, ambivalence and self-awareness." [...] The New York Observer concluded: [...] " [...] gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of Hugh Grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for words-and with an English accent besides. In the end, the film comes over as a messy delight, thanks to the skill, generosity and good-sport, punching-bag panache of Mr. Grant's performance." [...] About a Boy also marked a notable change in Grant's boyish look. Now 41, he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair. Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman took note of Grant's maturation in his review, saying he looked noticeably older and that it [...] "looked good on him." [...] He added that Grant's [...] "pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn, and the eyes that used to peer with 'love me' cuteness now betray a shark's casual cunning. Everything <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> leaner and spikier (including his hair, which has been shorn and moussed into a Eurochic bed-head mess), but it's not just his surface that's more virile; the nervousness is gone, too. Hugh Grant has grown up, holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherry-club mannerisms that were once his signature. In doing so, he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silver-tongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency." ...|$|E
