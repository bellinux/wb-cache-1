As a result, a company called Rhythm Authors was created by Joseph Cirri, the founder of ScoreHero; {{for a portion of}} the song's sale, they will assist bands by creating the appropriate note tracking for their songs, peer review them, and help to train others to do the tasks. Within a week of the company's reveal, sixteen bands had signed up for Rhythm Authors' services. Other companies, including RockGamers Studios, TuneCore, and WaveGroup Sound, have also been formed for authoring; while authoring rates vary between the companies, it is estimated to be approximately $500 per minute of transcoded song. Harmonix provided training classes on the Rock Band Network tools and promotion at the September 2009 GameSoundCon Conference in Los Angeles. Harmonix' Greg LoPiccolo stated that he believes the authoring community will also come up with further plug-ins for the authoring software to further automate the song creation process.

Using Propositions 10, 12 and 13 in the original paper, we can apply Proposition 3. 28 in [1] and obtain that live(ClerkR) klive(RPC) klive(RMemory 0) is a live I/O automaton. By applying Theorem 2 in [4] twice, we obtain that live(ClerkRkRPC kRMemory 0) is a live I/O automaton.

40|$|This paper investigates women's and men's labor {{supply to}} the firm within a {{structural}} approach based on a dynamic model of new monopsony. Using methods of survival analysis and a large linked employer-employee dataset for Germany, we find that labor supply elasticities are small (1. 9 - 3. 7) and that women's labor {{supply to the}} firm is less elastic than men's (which is the reverse of gender differences in labor supply usually found {{at the level of}} the market). Our results imply that about one third of the gender pay gap might be wage discrimination by profit-maximizing monopsonistic employers. <b>Author</b> <b>note</b> Writing of this paper has been partially supported by a grant from the Bavarian Graduate Program in Economics to the first author.

To study the virtualization of the family we used axiological approach. Method - a secondary analysis of sociological data. Main idea: virtualization of the family is manifested in the erosion of its institutional characteristics. Conclusion: The main manifestation of the virtualization of the family as a social institution - decrease of the value of family status and as a result, reducing of its value in society. Author examined within the family and outside the family values. It was also noted the influence of age and gender on the within the family and outside the family value orientation of individual.

40|$|In {{a recent}} article by Scafetta, 2010, the author investigates {{whether or not the}} decadal and multi-decadal climate {{oscillations}} have an astronomical origin. In particular, the <b>author</b> <b>note</b> that several global surface temperature records, since 1850, and records deduced from the orbits of the planets present very similar power spectra. Among the detected frequencies, large climate oscillations of about 20 and 60 years, respectively, appear synchronized to the orbital periods of Jupiter and Saturn. Other investigators have already noted that many climate, geophysical and astromomical data clearly show the appearance of a significant, approximately 60 -year cycle. Of course, this cycle length is not exactly 60 years and varies by a few years (frequency band) between various climatic and astronomical phenomena. The main aim of the present research note is to further investigate the above results, considering different long-term time series and using a proper continuous wavelet analysis. In particular, we specifically consider the feature and importance of the sixty-year periodicity, in order to better build reliable models for climate predictions. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|Let S k be the k-th partial sum of Banach space valued {{independent}} identically distributed random variables. In this paper, {{we compare}} the tail distribution of kS k k {{with that of}} kS j k, and deduce some tail distribution maximal inequalities. The main result {{of this paper was}} inspired by the inequality from [dP{M] that says that Pr(kX 1 k > t) 5 Pr(kX 1 +X 2 k > t= 2) whenever X 1 and X 2 are independent identically distributed. Such results for L p (p 1) such as kX 1 k p kX 1 +X 2 k p are straightforward, at least if X 2 has zero expectation. This inequality is also obvious if either X 1 is symmetric, or X 1 is real valued positive. However, for arbritary random variables, this result is somewhat surprizing to the <b>author.</b> <b>Note</b> that the identically distributed assumption cannot be dropped, as one could take X 1 = 1 and X 2 = 1. In this paper, we prove a generalization to sums of arbritarily many independent identically distributed random variables. Note that all results in t [...] ...|$|E

WHEN VALUES AND BEHAVIOR CONFLICT 2 The authors review the various ways moral hypocrisy has been defined and operationalized by social psychologists, concentrating on three general types: moral duplicity, moral double standards, and moral weakness. While most approaches have treated moral hypocrisy as an interpersonal phenomenon, requiring public claims, preaching (vs. practicing), or judgments of others (vs. oneself), this paper also considers intrapersonal moral hypocrisy – that is, conflicts between values and behavior that may exist even in the absence of public pronouncements or judgments. Current attempts to understand and combat intrapersonal moral hypocrisy are aided by moral pluralism, the idea that there are many different moral values, which may come into conflict both between and within individuals. Examples are given to illustrate how taking into account individual differences in values can help to reduce moral hypocrisy. The authors close by considering the possibility that in a pluralistic world, reducing intrapersonal moral hypocrisy might not always be a normatively desired end goal...|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the direction of influence between objective and subjective career success. We conducted a prospective longitudinal study with 5 waves of measurement that covered a time span of ten years. Participants were professionals working in different occupational fields (N = 1, 336). We modelled the changes in objective success (income, hierarchical position), in other-referent subjective success (subjective success as compared to a reference group), and in self-referent subjective success (job satisfaction) by means of latent growth curve analysis. Objective success influenced both the initial level and the growth of other-referent subjective success, but it had no influence on job satisfaction. Most importantly, both measures of subjective success and both their initial levels and their changes had strong influences on the growth of objective success. We conclude that the “objective success influences subjective success ” relationship is smaller than might be expected, whereas the “subjective success influences objective success ” relationship is larger than might be expected. <b>Author</b> <b>note</b> Writing of this paper has been partially {{supported by a grant from}} the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft to the first author.

The emotional dog and its rational tail: A social intuitionist approach to moral judgment. Psychological Review. 108, 814 - 834 Copyright 2001, American Psychological Association To obtain a reprint {{of the final}} type-set article, please go through your library’s journal services, or contact the author directly Research on moral judgment {{has been dominated by}} rationalist models, in which moral judgment is thought to be caused by moral reasoning. Four reasons are given for considering the hypothesis that moral reasoning does not cause moral judgment; rather, moral reasoning is usually a post-hoc construction, generated after a judgment has been reached. The social intuitionist model is presented as an alternative to rationalist models. The model is a social model in that it de-emphasizes the private reasoning done by individuals, emphasizing instead the importance of social and cultural influences. The model is an intuitionist model in that it states that moral judgment is generally the result of quick, automatic evaluations (intuitions). The model is more consistent than rationalist models with recent findings in social, cultural, evolutionary, and biological psychology, as well as anthropology and primatology. <b>Author</b> <b>note...</b>|$|E
