Some hindrance to honey supply and marketing were also identified. To achieve {{the aim of this}} study, fifty (50) questionnaires were distributed to five communities randomly selected in the study area. Ten questionnaires were administered in each community to collect data from beekeepers. The socio economic variables analysis revealed that 64 % of the <b>apiculturists</b> were males while 36 % were females. Up to 62 % of the <b>apiculturists</b> were Christians while 36 % were Muslims and 2 % of them were neither Christians nor Muslims. Majority of the producers were in the range of 30 - 40 years. 4 % of the honey producers were singles while 96 % were married. NCE holders were 30 % while 10 % were degree holders. Fifty two percent of the <b>apiculturists</b> inherited the farmland while 9 % purchased land. Top bars hive were used by 84 %, while 6 % used langsroth and 10 % used other type of hives. Traditional method of beekeeping was used by 14 %, while 86 % used modern method of beekeeping. This study shows that 20 % of the <b>apiculturists</b> chose beekeeping as their main occupation while 80 % chose apiculture as secondary occupation.

50|$|Beekeepers {{are also}} called honey farmers, apiarists, or less commonly, <b>apiculturists</b> (both from the Latin apis, bee; cf. apiary). The term {{beekeeper}} {{refers to a}} person who keeps honey bees in beehives, boxes, or other receptacles. Honey bees are not domesticated and the beekeeper does not control the creatures. The beekeeper owns the hives or boxes and associated equipment. The bees are free to forage or leave (swarm) as they desire. Bees usually return to the beekeeper's hive as the hive presents a clean, dark, sheltered abode.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that there is a small number of <b>apiculturists</b> in Bužim, {{apiculture}} as an agricultural branch could be significant for our municipality. Apiculture should be given more attention because honey as the main bee product is irreplaceable in nutrition. Besides honey, bee products are considered to be: wax used in chemical and pharmaceutical industry, propolis, royal jelly and bee venom. Honey production is an additional activity of the population by which the family budgets are increased. The approximate production is 12 kilos per beehive, and honey is sold in the local market.|$|R
30|$|Many {{residents}} mentioned using fire {{in conjunction}} with biannual honey and comb harvests. In the wet, early summer months of November and December, <b>apiculturists</b> visit hives in closed forest, woodland, and open woodland to harvest wild hives and bee boxes. Non-native eucalyptus trees produce a lot of pollen during the dry months of June and July when many native plants are not flowering. Wild honey is collected {{at this time in}} eucalyptus plantation stands and from boxed colonies located within 1 km of these stands. Traditional honey and comb collectors light a dry branch or bundle of grass, direct the smoke and fire at the hive to calm and kill bees, and usually take care to put out the fire before leaving the area. However, the combination of drought, dry vegetation, and tree resin makes eucalyptus stands particularly vulnerable to fire.|$|R

40|$|In {{the light}} of a {{possible}} global pollinator decline (Allen-Wardel et al., 1998; Ghazoul, 2005) it is important to asses the current status of key pollinators, particularly in areas where important natural habitat losses have been taking place. Kept by <b>apiculturist</b> all over the world both for honey production and pollination services, the honeybee Apis mellifera is a pollinator of paramount importance for the maintenance of food supply systems. In this study we employed genetic markers to quantify the density of honeybee colonies in different semi-natural regions of Europe. Using a set of tightly linked microsatellite markers (Lattorff et al., in prep), we genotyped drones and worker offspring from mated queens (Kraus et al., 2005).

Finally, the <b>apiculturist</b> often wishes to extend his knowledge of bees beyond the confines of the honey bee. Recent years have seen a revival of interest in bees by all of these groups and, with it, a profusion of taxonomic and bio-logical literature. This interest among scientists has been stimulated by exciting biological and behavioral discoveries, attempts to determine the value of biological information, and a concern in pollinator management by farmers engaged in the production of seed, fruit, and vegetable crops. It is our hope that the following general synthesis of knowledge about bees, with special emphasis on northwestern genera, will be of general interest to many entomologists, botanists, and agriculturists and may have special value as a handbook for workers in the Northwest. The study was prepared so that {{it would be useful to}} students for class and field use, and apprise workers of the present state of knowledge in bees so that existing gaps may be more systematically filled. It has also presented an opportunity to speculate on several facets of systematics and ethology. This work reviews present knowledge of the mor-phology and biology of bees in general, but emphasizes northwestern forms and, in many instances, uses themas standards of reference. No attempt is made to systematically cover morphological and biological information for each taxon, although morphological information of particular value for the separation of taxonomic groups is included. The taxonomic treatment does not extend below the generic level and is confined to northwestern forms except for a more comprehensive treatment of families. The Northwest, as here interpreted, includes the area west of the Rocky Mountains, bounded on the south by the latitude 41 ° N, and extending north to include British Columbia and Alaska. (See the map inside the front cover.) Several genera included in the key have not yet been taken in the above-defined area, but because they are known to occur immediately to the south or east there is a possibility that they may have escaped detection or else that they may soon become members of our bee fauna.

A four-item open-ended questionnaire was used to collect data from the respondents in 2015 and 2016 cropping seasons. Findings show that majority of the apiarists used local attractants in bee baiting with cow dung accounting for 47. 4 % and 26. 9 % as the larger proportions in 2015 and 2016, respectively. While cumulatively beehive colonisation accounted for only 22. 5 % against 77. 5 % empty beehives in the first year, the second year recorded 62. 5 % and 37. 5 % colonised and unoccupied beehives, respectively.

40|$|European Union (EU) {{has banned}} {{the use of}} three pesticides: clothianidin, {{thiamethoxam}} and imidacloprid in bee attractive crops. These pesticides all belong to a pesticide group called neonicotinoids, and they {{are believed to be}} a contributing factor in the declining bee population. The ban was enforced in EU the 1 st of December 2013. Neonicotinoids (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) {{are an important part of}} the control of pests in oilseed rape production in Danish agriculture. The neonicotinoids are generally used as a seed treatment in oilseed rape. The coatings of the rape seeds prevent young plants from pest attack. The seed treatment of oilseed rape helps controlling Cabbage stem flea beetle (Psylliodes chrysocephala). The lack of seed treatment in oilseed rape could result in extra treatments with pyrethroids (lambda-cyhalothrin, Gamma cyhalothrin and Cypermethrin). 	 This project aims to identify if the banning of the three neonicotinoids (clothianidin, thamethoxam and imidacloprid), seems to result in a farming practice that puts more or less pressure on the Danish environment, with special emphasis on honey bees. In Denmark there has not been reported poisoning of honey bees from either pyrethroids or neonicotinoids. Pesticides are among the Danish <b>apiculturist</b> not seen as a major concern, which indicates little identified negative effect of the neonicotinoids on honey bees. When treatment with neonicotinoids in oilseed rape is substituted with a treatment with pyrethroids, the time of application should pose no threat to honey bees, as the crop are not flowering and the application period will be in the autumn, where few flowers are present in the Danish environment. 	The change in oilseed farming practice does not necessarily increase the load on the Danish environment (based on calculation of Area Load). If the Danish farmers substitute the neonicotinoids seed treatment with an extra treatment of the pyrethroid with the least Area Load (Karate WG (Lambda-cyhalothrin)). If Danish farmers based on the higher taxation, in the future solely will use Karate WG in oilseed rape, the Area Load can actually decrease compared to before the ban of neonicotinoids even with three applications. Findings of resistance in Cabbage stem flea beetle in Germany towards pyrethroids makes a plausible scenario being breakdown of control of this pest in oilseed rape. Previously the control of Cabbage stem flea beetle has been based on neonicotinoids and pyrethroids, which have different modes of action in Cabbage stem flea beetle. Resistance among Cabbage stem flea beetle towards pyrethroids would result in the need of stronger doses and more applications, which would give rise to higher load on the environment including bees (increase in AL). A worst case scenario could be the need to abandon cultivation of rape in Denmark...|$|E

Results indicate a C lineage origin, whilst mitochondrial analysis suggests two drones originated from the O lineage. Analysis of heterozygous SNPs identified potential copy number variants near to genes encoding odorant binding proteins and several cytochrome P 450 genes.

We found that colony food accumulation and wax production were positively related to cropland and negatively related to forest and grassland, a pattern that may be driven by the abundance of dandelion and clovers in agricultural areas compared to forest or mature grassland. Colony food accumulation was also negatively correlated with urban land cover in sites dominated by urban and agricultural land use, which does not support the popular opinion that the urban environment is more favorable to honey bees than cropland...|$|R

Over 67 %  of the bee families were kept in apiaries whose size was ranging between 50 and 100 bee families and 18   % of apiaries were larger than 100 bee families. About 65 %  of honey was achieved  by the apiaries whose size  belonged to 50 - 100   bee families category  and 16. 59 %  in the largest ones with over 100 bee families. The income earned by the 20 <b>apiculturists</b> accounted for Lei 281, 230 in 2011, meaning  Lei 14, 061. 50 per beekeeper. About 67 % of income {{was carried out in}} the apiaries  with 50 - 100 bee families and 11. 42 % in the ones larger than 100   bee families. As a conclusion, the increase of the number of bee families per apairy and production diversification are the main facors to grow honey production and beekepers’ income...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{two cases}} of honey procurement {{in the province}} of West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Both involve the same resource, i. e. honey from Apis dorsata bees. However, in each case this resource is handled differently, showing that local resource management practices may be very site specific. Any local resource management practices involve local technological knowledge, but also social behavior, restrictions, and rules systems. The paper argues that such institutionalized resource management provides a sound basis for resource use that meets new challenges, such as achieving sustainable use or increasing monetary incomes. The possible practical implications depend on the particularities of each individual case. The first case this paper examines is honey tree management among the Maté-maté Dayak, who make up one of the Bidayuh language groups living in the district of Sanggau, Central West Kalimantan. These people can own single honey trees that are inhabited by bees; they protect the trees and encourage bees to nest in them. The second case involves honey procurements by Malay who live in the Danau Sentarum lake area, in the district of Kapuas Hulu, about 250 km east of the Maté-mate Dayak. Here, <b>apiculturists</b> assemble specially shaped boards that are popular nesting sites for A. dorsata bees. Once a swarm finds such a board, it continues to occupy the same board in successive years. Both Dayak and Malay beekeepers have an elaborate set of rules that regulate access to the trees and the nesting sites and impose fines for the breaking of such rules...|$|R
40|$|Folk {{tradition}} explains each animal {{through an}} invariable and complete group of characteristic features, which correlates {{with a group}} of characteristic features inherent of a given character in specific local traditions. The cultural language of each tradition prefers some qualities, attributes, predicates, etc. of the animal to others, and attaches symbolic significance to these, while excluding others from the cultural frame and context. In this case one and the same animal can inspire widely different, often unassociated symbolic meanings. The article observes the mechanisms of symbolisation inherent to cultural language through a creature well known in popular zoology - the bee. Bee is thought to be superior of other insects because of its divine heavenly nature. Of all other insects only ladybird beetle and silkworm have been attributed similar superiority. In etiological legends bees, as the creation of God, are opposed to bumblebees, hornets, wasps or flies created by the Devil. The Slavonic people honour bee as a pure creature of God. The texts and apicultural traditions of the Slavonic people associate the bee also with the Mother of God. Folk tradition attributes the bees purity and sacredness, but also virginity and celibacy. Their chthonic qualities become evident in a motif of their originating from a cave of a mythical rock, etc. The superiority of Christian thinking over paganism in these beliefs {{can be explained by the}} special role of apiculture in folk tradition in general. This autonomous and esoteric sphere of culture, practised only by men or professional <b>apiculturists,</b> became the preserver of the archaic layer of ancient traditions and beliefs, but was also susceptible to the influence of literature (often mediated by beekeepers as an educated class of village community). The spread of literature greatly contributed to the penetration of Christian elements in this sphere of tradition...|$|R
40|$|Farmers {{and environmentalists}} alike have long held one view in common {{regarding}} the use of insecticides: they tend to believe that such chemicals cannot be made to discriminate between helpful and harmful insects. By and large, this is true; but it need not always be so. Besides not wanting to kill beneficial insect predators, farmers and <b>apiculturists</b> have been particularly wary of the adverse effects of insecticides on bee populations. They know that certain crops, if unpollinated, may fail to produce good yields of seed or fruit. The International Bee Research Association (IBRA) has now made a positive contribution towards solving this problem by publishing a manual and directory on 'Pest Control Safe for Bees'. And the good news for 'Spore' readers is that this practical guide is specifically concerned with problems of 85 of the major crops grown in the tropics and sub-tropics. This is a book for extension officers, beekeepers and users of pesticides at the training college, aid agency or development project level. It is both a reference book and a source of practical guidance. The book is available only in English, but the 120 explanatory drawings help to make it easy to follow in any language.

40|$|Nest {{structures}} of the Australian blue-banded bee, Amegilla holmesi Rayment (Hymenoptera: Apidae), are difficult to monitor non-invasively, because the bee is a fossorial species that constructs tunnels and natal cells within the soil. Visualization of nest structures requires physical separation of the structures from the soil substrate, which destroys the nest. Using helical, two-dimensional (2 D) X-ray computerized tomography (CT), and three–dimensional (3 D) volume rendering software on 13 artificial mud-brick nests, {{we were able to}} view all previously reported nest structures and cell contents without damaging the nests. We used three volume rendering algorithms (sum along ray, scatter HQ, and false colour), two of which (scatter HQ and false colour) have not previously been used to visualize nest architecture. Each algorithm has a particular advantage for visualizing specific nest structures. The 2 D CT images provided the greatest spatial resolution within and between nest structures (capture pixel matrix size 512 × 512; voxel size 0. 449 mm 3), {{and for the first time}} we were able to visualize a meniscus within natal cells that contained liquid provisions, which is a valuable characteristic in detecting the earliest stage of juvenile development once a natal cell is sealed. We also recorded and attributed Hounsfield units to nest structures and their contents that can be utilized in future studies. This new method also enabled us to count and measure natal cells using on-screen linear callipers, visually observe and record stages of larval and pupal development, and visually gauge the incidence of cell parasitism without damaging the nest. Artificial nests can be transported easily to research facilities that have CT scanners; each scan including image processing takes less than 30 min per nest and currently costs less than AUD 20. 00, which is within the reach of <b>apiculturists.</b> X-ray CT could be used to follow the life cycle of blue-banded bees and other cryptic species and also to monitor their health...|$|R
40|$|The Participative Territorial Planning in the State of Pará, Brazil, was {{designed}} as a guiding program to the State Government in 2007, consisting of one of the three macro-objectives of government action. The program was associated with the idea of creating spaces for participation and regional integration, aimed at preparing the Plano Plurianual 2008 - 2011 (2008 - 2011 Multi-Year Plan - PPA) in a democratic and participatory way, by including municipal and regional demands decided along with a gradual popular participation that would culminate with the establishment of regional and state councils as a means of participation and social control, with 3. 983 elected counselors. These counselors represented different social segments and groups, among which {{it would be interesting to}} highlight those involved with the agricultural/rural industry (such as farmers, agroextractivists, <b>apiculturists,</b> peasants, rural extensionists, agricultural producers, land workers, cattle breeders, fishermen, small, medium and large farmers and rural trade unionists), and were equally distributed among 12 regions of the State. Based on the fact that a considerable amount of the counselors were linked to the rural world, the aim of this paper is to analyze the rural identity of these members and how the rural-urban dichotomy was expressed in the process of thinking about the State and about regional integration. We will work with the profiles of the counselors; with the demands presented in the AssembleiasPú blicasMunicipais (Municipal Public Meetings - APMs), as recorded in the minutes; as well as with the profile of the demands that were chosen and integrated into the PPA 2008 - 2011 and with the Annual Budgetary Laws of the years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, as systematized by the PTP team and by the SEPOF. We intend to discuss the public funding destined to the "rural areas of the State of Pará" and the symbolism of what it means to live in the countryside...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to make an inventory of the honey production in the counties of Bejaia and Tizi-Ouzou in northeastern Algeria. To achieve this, a survey was carried out on 31 beekeepers (14 in Bejaia and 17 in Tizi-Ouzou). The survey shows a social, cultural and religious role for 61. 29 % of the beekeepers. The beekeeping is primarily held by men (93. 55 %). It is the basic source of income for 64. 52 % of the respondents. The average age of the beekeepers is 42. 90 years (Min-Max: 28 - 67 years, Median: 40. 5 years). The main products of the hive are honey (100 %), swarms (16. 13 %), royal jelly (9. 68 %) and propolis (9. 68 %). The average honey production per hive is 7. 70 kg (Min-Max: 0. 4 - 15 kg hives, Median: 10 kg). The average number of hives per beekeeper is 42. 20 hives (Min-Max: 3 - 300 hives, Median: 17. 50 hives). The average selling price of one kg of honey is 4000. 00 DA / kg (Min-Max: 2000 - 5000 DA; Median: 4000 DA). The phenotype of the bee reported by 74. 19 % of the surveys is of small size with a long body and dark pigmentation corresponding to the breed “Apis mellifera intermissa”. Two <b>apiculturists</b> described another phenotype corresponding to the “Apis mellifera major”. The factors behind the motivations for beekeeping are consumption of honey (100 %), income generation (90. 32 %), hobby (58. 06 %) and conservation of biodiversity (22. 58 %). The multiple constraints associated with several diseases, notably Varroase (mentioned by 80. 65 % of beekeepers), cause difficulties for the breeders. Thus they cannot profit maximum from beekeeping. Other constraints which were reported are; forest fires (35. 48 %), wasps (32. 26 %), absence of beekeeping professionals or technicians (29. 03 %), harsh and cold winters with snow (19. 35 %), high density of hives in the region (16. 13 %) and uncontrolled spreading of pesticides and crop protection products at farms (12. 90 %). The economic situation of the Algerian beekeepers can be optimized by improving the production potential of the local bees. Peer reviewe...|$|R
