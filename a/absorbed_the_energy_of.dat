25|$|Aside {{from their}} immense size, Chinese walls were also {{structurally}} {{different from the}} ones built in medieval Europe. Whereas European walls were {{for the most part}} constructed of stone with gravel or rubble filling and limestone mortar, Chinese walls had tamped earthen cores which <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> artillery shots. Walls were built using constructed wooden frameworks which were then filled with layers of earth tamped down to a highly compact state, and once that was completed the frameworks were removed for use in the next wall section. Starting from the Song dynasty these walls were improved with an outer layer of bricks or stone to prevent erosion, and during the Ming, earthworks were interspersed with stone and rubble. Most Chinese walls were also sloped rather than vertical to better deflect projectile energy.|$|E

As Genesis, he <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> many mutants to increase his power, but he never displayed any increased mutant powers afterwards; instead, somewhat like his father, he relied on powered armor and advanced weaponry.|$|E

He also founded his own company, the Muto Institute of Structural Mechanics, in 1965.At Kajima, he led the team that designed Japan's first high-rise building, the 36-story Kasumigaseki Building. Among his innovations for this building was first energy dissipation system used in Japan, a slit wall system consisting of precast reinforced concrete strips that stabilized the building under strong winds and small earthquakes and <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> strong earthquakes.|$|E

They saw that instead of the Jamaat's directing their energies outwardly towards their legitimate Kaafir enemies, was now directed inwardly towards the rest of the Muslims.

5000|$|By far, {{his most}} devastating power was {{the ability to}} absorb the {{energies}} of his surroundings into himself, once he fused with his antimatter universe, he went even as far as absorbing the energies of entire universes. In addition to devouring the energies of untold numbers of universes, he also <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> [...] "over one million worlds" [...] in his own anti-matter universe {{in order to gain}} the power to travel to the beginning of time, to attempt to stop the creation of the positive matter universe. When Earth's heroes followed him to the beginning of time, he then absorbed all of their power and energy; this made him strong enough to alter the creation of the universe until he was opposed by the Spectre. During his final battle in Crisis on Infinite Earths #12, the Anti-Monitor maintained his power by [...] "feeding on" [...] a nearby star; and when his power was drained and he was reduced to a state of near-death, he absorbed his own anti-matter demons to rejuvenate himself.|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the photoluminescence (PL) characteristics of ZnO:Er thin films on Si (100) single crystal and SiO 2 -on-silicon (SiO 2) substrates, synthesized by radio frequency magnetron sputtering. Rutherford backscattering/channeling spectrometry (RBS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscope (AFM) were {{used to analyze the}} properties of thin films. The diffusion depth profiles of Si were determined by second ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Infrared spectra were obtained from the spectrometer and related instruments. Compared with the results at room temperature (RT), PL (1. 54 μm) intensity increased when samples were annealed at 250 °C and decreased when at 550 °C. A new peak at 1. 15 μm from silicon (Si) appeared in 550 °C samples. The Si dopants in ZnO film, either through the diffusion of Si from the substrate or ambient, directly <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> pumping light and resulted in the suppression of Er 3 + 1. 54 μm excitation. Furthermore, the energy transmission efficiency between Si and Er 3 + was very low when compared with silicon nanocrystal (Si-NC). Both made the PL (1. 54 μm) intensity decrease. All the data in experiments proved the negative effects of Si dopants on PL at 1. 54 μm. And further research is going on...|$|E

50|$|Originally {{the inner}} {{faces of the}} {{emplacement}} were revetted with masonry.

50|$|Soundproofing is {{any means}} of {{reducing}} the sound pressure {{with respect to a}} specified sound source and receptor. There are several basic approaches to reducing sound: increasing the distance between source and receiver, using noise barriers to reflect or <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sound waves, using damping structures such as sound baffles, or using active antinoise sound generators.|$|R
50|$|In {{electronic}} absorption, {{the frequency}} of the incoming light wave is at or near <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrons within the atoms which compose the substance.

50|$|The {{avalanches}} {{are caused}} when {{the impact of}} a new grain of sand is sufficient to dislodge some group of sand grains.

5000|$|Rudy Jones and Dr. Torval Freeman gained {{enhanced}} strength, intelligence, agility {{and stamina}} by <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> other beings.

Parasite is shown to have a special visual perception that allows him to see and sense life energy and power within a being. Even aliens such as Superman aren't immune to Parasite's power. Like regular metahumans, Superman can be drained {{to the point of being}} comparable to humans while Parasite becomes just as strong as Superman is normally. However, <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> drain only works when Parasite is in physical contact with the target. Drawing <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> ordinary beings such as normal humans is almost instantaneous, but for immensely powerful beings it takes quite a long time, which can let them enough time and energy to react and free from Parasite's grip (a deed Superman did more than once).|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{flywheel}} systems require strong containment vessels as {{a safety}} precaution, which increases the total mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> device. <b>The</b> <b>energy</b> release from failure can be dampened with a gelatinous or encapsulated liquid inner housing lining, which will boil and <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> destruction.

2500|$|The track will {{facilitate}} pod test runs where each pod is accelerated, achieves a top measured speed that is reported in real-time, and then decelerates by braking, ostensibly {{before the end}} of the test track.

50|$|In stream restoration, river {{engineering}} or coastal engineering, revetments are sloping structures {{placed on}} banks or cliffs {{in such a}} way as to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> incoming water. In military engineering they are structures, again sloped, formed to secure an area from artillery, bombing, or stored explosives. River or coastal revetments are usually built to preserve the existing uses of the shoreline and to protect the slope, as defense against erosion.|$|R
50|$|SawStop's saws apply a {{small amount}} of {{electric}} voltage to the blade of the saw. The current through the blade is continuously monitored. If the saw detects a change in this current (as would occur if a hand or other body part came into contact with the blade), an automatic braking system is activated, forcing an aluminum brake block into the blade. This aluminum block is designed to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> blade by deforming.|$|R
