25|$|Penny Sparrow is {{one such}} {{high-profile}} case. She posted the following through her Facebook account:These monkeys that are allowed to be released on New Year’s eve and New Year’s day on to public beaches towns etc obviously have no education what so ever so to allow them loose is inviting huge dirt and troubles and discomfort to others. I’m sorry to say that I was among the revellers and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> were black on black skins what a shame. I do know some wonderful and thoughtful black people. This lot of monkeys just don’t want to even try. But think they can voice opinions about statute and get their way oh dear. From now I shall address the blacks of South Africa as monkeys as I see the cute little wild monkeys do the same, pick drop and litter.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the seventh season, the {{producers}} sought to re-introduce Dax but with a new host. They decided immediately that it had to be a female character, as otherwise Kira Nerys, played by Nana Visitor, would be the only female main character. There were some difficulties in finding an actress who met the requirements of the part; Ira Steven Behr said [...] "So we started the casting process, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> was a lot of people who couldn't play the part. There was absolutely no one in the running." [...] The initial casting call required an actress with a [...] "spooky" [...] quality, but following the failure to find someone adequate, co-supervising producer René Echevarria suggested that the character instead should be someone who was unprepared to be joined with Dax and only did so because of an unexpected occurrence.|$|E
2500|$|This was {{the final}} appearance. Because the grotto was barricaded by the local government, Soubirous knelt outside the fence by the riverbank. [...] "I thought I was at the Grotto, at the same {{distance}} as I was the other times. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> was Our Lady... She was more beautiful than ever." ...|$|E
60|$|On Monday, {{after sitting}} up <b>all</b> night, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Bellingham {{launched}} into eternity [1], and at three {{the same day}} <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> * * * launched into the country.|$|R

6000|$|<b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{was a man}} shovelling snow; and, {{thoroughly}} puzzled, I {{turned to}} Richard, demanding an explanation. He laughed, and answered readily,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I didn't. It {{was rather}} {{dark in the}} hall, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> was that it {{contained}} pencils and crayons," [...] answered Jerry Koswell.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} Philippa. She had heard <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her dark brow {{contract}} in anguish. She was beating her breast furiously--her habit {{in moments of}} agitation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you might}} say that, too. I believe {{she is going to}} turn out a decided character, after <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> anybody so {{determined}} not to be married in a storage warehouse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To far-off lands whence I came, a sea-girt land {{which once}} was mine own. My fathers lived there. I {{would go back}} and tell my people of <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> here on Calvary seven years ago." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But I {{know of no}} God the Holy Spirit, and Fate is not God at <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in {{my vision}} one sole God, uncrucified, militant--conquering and to conquer." ...|$|E
60|$|I entered. It was a small, untidy room, {{smelling of}} smoky lamp; but <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{distinctly}} {{at the moment}} was Miss Sellars with her arms above her head, pinning her hat upon her straw-coloured hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has gone}} across the gardens," [...] she cried breathlessly. [...] "I saw him running. Perhaps {{he will get}} away, after <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> one of the policemen fall down, and he was quite a long way ahead then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, she's <b>all</b> right. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her on one {{of those}} whirligig things, talking to her young man as I came in. But I'll go if you wish, though I'd rather go a hundred miles the other way.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure I do. He {{used to be}} in {{a jewelry}} firm in Albany. They tried to stick our firm-- but we shut down on 'em. But that isn't <b>all,</b> Dick. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Japson to-day-- not two hours ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never!" [...] said Barker. [...] "Never {{thought about}} IT AT <b>ALL</b> till <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the newspaper. So it's not worth anything?" [...] And, to the {{infinite}} {{surprise of the}} manager, {{there was a slight}} smile on his boyish face.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{it was a}} very grand party, I believe, and {{not exactly}} stupid--it was not, that; but I was disgusted with <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> and all I heard. It seemed to me a mass of affectation, falsehood, and malignity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{remember}} {{he asked me}} something about the post office while we were out sailing. Then I saw him sneaking about the place when I was putting up circulars there. And that is not <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him buying powder at Mr. Dunham's store." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{right there}} I saw {{and knew it}} <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the hungry {{children}} asleep, and the missus sitting up and waiting for Bill to come home, waiting to know whether they were to have food to eat or be thrown out in the street.|$|E
60|$|<b>All</b> this <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in an instant, as it were, and as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it, horror {{seemed to}} grip {{me by the}} throat {{as though it were}} a living thing, for as the voice had been familiar, so was the form familiar, though the churchyard had {{received}} it long years ago. I could not speak--I could not even move.|$|R
60|$|It will be {{observed}} that this diet {{is as simple}} as it well can be; but I think it right to add, after personal inspection, that the inmates appear to thrive on it extremely well. Certainly <b>all</b> whom <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> looked well nourished and healthy.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then it is <b>all</b> right. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Alwyn Egremont, Esquire, {{and family}} among the arrivals at Nice, but I hardly durst expect {{that it was}} you. It seemed {{too good to be}} true, though I took care the knot should be tied faster than my gentleman suspected.' ...|$|R
60|$|By {{that time}} he thought I was about as near as convenient, and lit out so it would have done your heart good to see him travel. And that was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> of that {{precious}} gang until what I am about to tell you.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered. [...] "I did {{not notice}} him at the station at <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that {{he was sitting at}} the same table downstairs as this gentleman, but I am quite sure that I have never seen him before in my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{he is said}} to {{have been}} much in debt long before; but it was managed quietly--not advertised in the county papers. He went to London, and {{arranged}} it <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> great renovations going on at the mill, when I went to see old Hardy.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{smiled to}} think that these childish devices were {{intended}} to deceive Sir Charles Vandrift. Not quite {{the sort of man}} (as the City of London knows) to be taken in by hocus-pocus. And <b>all</b> this, <b>I</b> <b>saw,</b> was the cheapest and most commonplace conjurer's patter.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{returned}} the packer, with a laugh; [...] "I don't carry treasure. But <b>I</b> see you're <b>all</b> right, too. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you crossin' over Galloper's." ...|$|R
60|$|Tommy the Song. He wouldn't {{know him}} to knock him down. They're <b>all</b> blind. <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> the like of it.|$|R
60|$|In {{the center}} of the chamber was a long table, and before it sat a little, pop-eyed old man {{counting}} his money; but, plainest of <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> upon the wall a great switch with a small magnet inlaid within the surface of its black handle.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But that's not <b>all!</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{them again}} under the gas when I got out. I was very near {{trying to speak}} to her, but I lost sight {{of her in the}} throng; but I saw that face so like Master Michael, only scared and just ready to cry.' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the odds}} were too unequal, and, though he who fought alone {{was by far the}} best and bravest of them <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that it was but a {{question}} of time before the remaining five would find an opening through his marvelous guard and bring him down.|$|E
60|$|I {{have just}} read your letter upon {{the top of}} the hill beside the church and castle. The whole air was filled with sunset and the sound of bells; and I wish I could give you the least notion of the southernness and Provençality of <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "A long time, {{but most}} of <b>all</b> since <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you. It has made me--it has made me {{hesitate}} more about the fundamental article of our faith. Even now, I am not sure whether it is not wrong of me to be talking so with you about such matters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Michaelmas daisies," [...] she said. [...] "I'm glad you'r not disfigured, {{and those}} are {{perennial}} sunflowers. Do you know no flowers at <b>all?</b> When <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you on the ground I certainly thought you were dead. You ought to have been, by all {{the rules of the}} game." ...|$|R
