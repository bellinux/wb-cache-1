Energy conservation was its theme: people would live and work within the area, most jobs would be energy related, and all buildings would be energy efficient. Little of this actually came to pass, and some critics would consider Energy Park a failure.

5000|$|The Head Start {{program was}} expanded, with the {{addition}} of 43,000 children and families, [...] while the percentage of nondefense dollars spent on education was doubled. The Child Nutrition Amendments Act of 1978 introduced a national income standard for program eligibility based on income standards prescribed for reduced-price school lunches. The Act also strengthened the nutrition education component of the WIC program by requiring the provision of nutritional education to all program participants. A Fair Debt Collection Practices Act was also passed with the aim of prohibiting [...] "abusive and unfair techniques of debt collection". The Housing and Community Development Act of 1977 set up Urban Development <b>Action</b> <b>Grants,</b> extended handicapped and elderly provisions, and established the Community Reinvestment Act of 1978, which sought to prevent banks from denying credit and loans to poor communities. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 was passed with the intention of enabling the coal industry to develop coal resources without damaging other natural resources in the process, while the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 was aimed at safeguarding mineworkers from harm in the workplace. Programs from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and women's programs were also strengthened and [...] "common sense priorities" [...] led to focus on major health problems. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 prohibited companies or organizations from discriminating against pregnant employees while providing protection in the areas of childbirth and medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth. The National Consumer Cooperative Bank Act of 1978 sought to put funds aside for low-interest loans to start cooperatives. Minimum wage coverage was extended to farmworkers, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act Amendments of 1978 increased the upper age limit on coverage against age discrimination in non-federal employment and in the private sector from 65 to 70 as a means of extending safeguards against age discrimination. In addition, the purchase requirement for food stamps was abolished, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program was introduced to assist families with their heating costs, and the first-ever national youth employment law was enacted.|$|E

40|$|The {{nature and}} {{effectiveness}} of such traditional social control methods in Alaska Native cultures is difficult to evaluate because of their displacement by methods introduced by fur traders, the Revenue Cutter Service, and U. S. Marshals. Territorial and state police continued the practice of establishing in Native communities the justice models {{with which they were}} familiar. The Alaska State Police began to organize formal training programs for Alaska Native people who would serve as police officers in Fairbanks (1964) and Juneau (1965), with more extensive police training programs financed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Nome in 1966 and the U. S. Department of Labor in 1968 (conducted by the Alaska State Troopers). [...] [...] Beginning in 1971, the Alaska Department of Public Safety received <b>action</b> <b>grants</b> from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) for the initiation of a broadly conceived program for developing crminal justice services in Alaska Native villages statewide — the Alaska Village Police Training program.

The present study evaluates the Alaska Village Police Training program over the seven-year period on program purpose and goals, program achievements and impacts, and program costs.
