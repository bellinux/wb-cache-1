5|$|Eva Perón then {{created the}} Female Peronist Party, the first large female {{political}} {{party in the}} nation. Navarro and Fraser write that by 1951, the party had 500,000 members and 3,600 headquarters across the country. Navarro and Fraser write that while Eva Perón did not consider herself a feminist, her impact on the political life of women was decisive. Thousands of previously apolitical women entered politics because of Eva Perón. They were the first women active in Argentine politics. The combination of female suffrage <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>organization</b> <b>of</b> the Female Peronist Party granted Juan Perón a large majority (sixty-three percent) {{of the vote in}} the 1951 presidential elections.|$|E
5|$|San Martín was {{not well}} {{received}} in Buenos Aires. Pueyrredón initially declined to give further help, citing the conflicts with the federal caudillos <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>organization</b> <b>of</b> a huge royalist army in Cádiz that would try to reconquer the La Plata basin. He thought that Chile should organize the navy against Peru, not Buenos Aires. San Martín discussed with him and finally got financing of 500,000 pesos. He returned to Mendoza {{with his wife and}} daughter and received a letter from Pueyrredón, who said that Buenos Aires could only deliver one-third of the promised funds. This complicated the project, as neither Santiago de Chile nor Mendoza had the resources needed. San Martín resigned from the Army, but it is unclear whether his decision to resign was sincere or was to apply pressure to his backers. The government of Buenos Aires still considered San Martín vital to the national defense, so Pueyrredón agreed to pay the 500,000 pesos requested, and encouraged San Martín to withdraw his resignation.|$|E
