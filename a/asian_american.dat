5000|$|Suzuki {{continued}} her activist activities {{even in her}} writing. In her library articles [...] "Asian Americans and libraries,"Suzuki writes to possible Asian-American librarians considering careers in the library profession. She dispels the myth that <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> have somehow [...] "made it" [...] when there exists a class ceiling preventing them from attaining positions of real power. She states that <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> should not {{feel the need to}} go into technical services and libraries with large Asian populations, where <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> are typically found in the profession. She encourages <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> to take administrative positions and feel comfortable work in areas where there are few or no Asians. Regardless of where <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> work, she hopes that <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> will make sure that library collections reflect the fact that <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> are {{part of the fabric of}} this country, from the building of the transcontinental to the internment of Japanese Americans. Her writing suggests that the biggest resource that <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> are adding to a library collection is their ethnic background.|$|R

50|$|Although no one {{religious}} affiliation claims {{a majority of}} <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans,</b> about 45 percent of them adhere {{to some form of}} Christianity. A Trinity College survey, conducted in 2008, found that 38 percent of Christian <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> are Catholic; Filipino Americans are majority Catholic, and a significant minority of Vietnamese Americans are as well. The Trinity survey also found that of all demographic populations, <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> had the highest number of respondents who did not claim a religion or refused to divulge their {{religious affiliation}}. Various surveys have put this number between 23 and 27 percent of <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans.</b> Additionally, the Trinity College survey found that 8% of <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> are Muslim; many of these Muslim <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> come from, or trace their ancestry to, Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Pakistan.|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> are fairly represented in professional occupations due to their high educational attainment.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} theoretical framework for studying attitudes towards <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> and a corresponding measure, the Attitudes Toward <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> scale (ATA). Three studies developed and validated the proposed theoretical framework and scale. The first study determined the factor structure underlying attitudes towards <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> and winnowed down the initial pool of items {{for inclusion in the}} final ATA scale. The second study confirmed the factor structure found in the first study and validated the ATA scale by testing the relation of its subscales to psychological constructs predicted by the theoretical framework. Finally, the third study showed that the positive stereotypes of <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> can lead to negative consequences for African Americans. Participants who were asked to think of <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> before evaluating African Americans were more likely to attribute African Americans 2 ̆ 7 social problems to their own shortcomings. The third study also provided preliminary evidence that people have ambivalent attitudes towards <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans.</b> The findings of the three studies are discussed and future directions for research on attitudes towards <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> suggested. ...|$|R

The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against people who may have been perceived as Muslims, Arabs, and others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin. A report by the South <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17.

5|$|German {{descendants}} inhabit much {{of central}} and southeast-central Texas.

Recently, the Asian population in Texas has grown—primarily in Houston and Dallas. Other communities with a significantly growing <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> population is in Austin, Corpus Christi, and the Sharyland area next McAllen, Texas.

5|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> {{population}} in the Bay Area is significant compared to other regions in the U.S., concentrated in the Bay Area city of Daly City.

Asian Americans also constitute a majority in Fremont, with significant populations in Sunnyvale and Santa Clara. The cities of San Jose and San Francisco had the third and fourth largest total number of Asian Americans out of every American city. In San Francisco, Chinese Americans constitute 21.4% of the population and constitute the single largest ethnic group in the city. Santa Clara county, and increasingly the East Bay, house a significant Indian American community. The Bay Area is home to over 382,950 Filipino Americans, one of the largest communities of Filipino people outside of the Philippines with the largest proportion of Filipino Americans concentrating themselves within American Canyon, Daly City, Fairfield, South San Francisco and Vallejo. There are more than 100,000 people of Vietnamese ancestry residing within San Jose city limits, the largest Vietnamese population of any city in the world outside of Vietnam. In addition, there is a sizable community of Korean Americans in Santa Clara county, where San Jose is located. East Bay cities such as Richmond and Oakland, and the North Bay city of Santa Rosa, have plentiful populations of Laotian and Cambodians in certain neighborhoods.
