40|$|Received for {{publication}} February 22, 1978) ABSTRACT Graded levels of 9 -[2 -chloro- 6 -fluorophenyl) methyl]- 9 //-purin- 6 -amine (arpri-nocid) ranging from 30 ppm to 90 ppm {{in the diet}} have been tested for anticoccidial efficacy in controlled battery experiments against 20 field isolates of coccidia. These isolates, representing five major species of Eimeria, were collected from various geographic locations and all but one {{were found to be}} resistant to {{one or more of the}} currently marketed products. <b>Arprinocid</b> prevented mortality, increased weight gains, and reduced or eliminated intestinal lesions and oocyst production. A level of 60 ppm <b>arprinocid</b> provided adequate control of all isolates and no evidence of cross resistance was observed between <b>arprinocid</b> and the marketed products tested. On the basis of these studies, it is concluded that <b>arprinocid</b> at levels of 60 ppm to 70 ppm is effective in controlling coccidiosis in broilers, even that caused by isolates refractory to many of the marketed products...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Monensin, lasalocid, salinomycin, nicarbazin, halofuginone, or <b>arprinocid</b> {{were fed}} to 1 -week-old male broiler chicks at {{recommended}} levels and 1. 5, 2, 2. 5, and 3 times the recom-mended level, for 3 weeks. Pair-feeding experiments also {{were conducted to}} investigate the extent that growth depression with medicated diets {{could be attributed to}} the drop in feed consumption. At the recommended level of drugs, growth and feed conversion were not significantly affected. At elevated drug levels, performance was impaired; the adverse effects of drugs became more pro-nounced with increasing the concentrations in the diets. Weight gain was significantly depressed at 1. 5 X with <b>arprinocid,</b> halofuginone, and salimomycin, at 1 to 2 X with monensin, at 2 X with lasalocid, and at 2. 5 X with nicarbazin. Feed conversion, however, was adversely affected by 2 X with halofuginone or 2. 5 X with salinomycin, nicarbazin, <b>arprinocid,</b> monensin, or lasalocid. The results of the pair-feeding experiments with 2 to 3 times drug levels indicated that most of the growth depression with medicated diets could be attributed to reduced feed consumption, but all drugs except <b>arprinocid</b> caused some additional growth depression...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Three floor-pen {{trials have}} {{confirmed}} the high anticoccidial activity of CL 259, 971 as first reported in batteries. The optimal dosage level {{was shown to}} be 5 ppm in the diet. At this level, excellent anticoccidial activity was observed with no adverse effect on weight or perform-ance. The results indicated that 5 ppm of CL 259, 971 provided efficacy and performance com-parable to <b>arprinocid</b> or monensin, which were used for comparison in these trials. (Key words: CL 259, 971, anticoccidial, coccidiosis, broiler performance...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a new micromethod to study the effect of drugs on microsporidia, using MRC 5 fibroblasts infected by 10 (5) spores of Encephalitozoon cuniculi. After 3 days of incubation with various concentrations of drugs, parasitic foci were counted in stained cultures. The inhibition of microsporidial growth exceeding 90 % with albendazole (0. 005 microgram/ml), fumagillin (0. 001 microgram/ml), 5 -fluorouracil (3 micrograms/ml), and sparfloxacin (30 micrograms/ml) was observed. Chloroquine, pefloxacin, azithromycin, and rifabutin were partially effective, at high concentrations. <b>Arprinocid,</b> metronidazole, minocycline, doxycycline, itraconazole, and difluoromethylornithine were not evaluable, since concentrations that inhibited microsporidia were also toxic for fibroblasts. Pyrimethamine, piritrexim, sulfonamides, paromomycin, roxithromycin, atovaquone, and flucytosine were ineffective. Our results confirm that albendazole and fumagillin have marked activity against E. cuniculi and show the antimicrosporidial activity of 5 -fluorouracil and sparfloxacin. These data may {{form the basis for}} treatment of Encephalitozoon hellem and Septata intestinalis infections and represent an attempt to identify drugs effective against Enterocytozoon bieneusi...|$|E
