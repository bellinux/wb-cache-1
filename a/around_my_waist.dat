500|$|The {{themes of}} the album are {{reflected}} in the album cover designed by Alexander McQueen. Björk approached McQueen explaining to him the person who wrote Homogenics songs was someone who [...] "had to become a warrior. A warrior who had to fight not with weapons, but with love. I had 10 kilos of hair on my head, and special contact lenses and a manicure that prevented me from eating with my fingers, and gaffer tape <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> and high clogs so I couldn't walk easily".|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{recruited}} artist Jeff Koons for {{the project}} in early 2013; the two had met previously at a Metropolitan Museum of Art fashion event three years earlier, where Gaga had a live performance. According to Koons, Gaga [...] "just kind of grabbed ahold of me {{and gave me a}} big hug <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> and replied, 'You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan of yours, and when I was a kid just hanging out in Central Park I would talk to my friends about your work'." [...] In addition to Interscope Records notifying mainstream media outlets about upcoming releases for Artpop in July 2013, Gaga announced plans for a multimedia software application which [...] "combines music, art, fashion, and technology with a new interactive worldwide community." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gaga {{recruited}} Jeff Koons {{into the}} project in early 2013, with the two having previously met at a Metropolitan Museum of Art fashion event three years earlier, where Gaga provided a live performance. According to Koons, she [...] "just kind of grabbed ahold of me {{and gave me a}} big hug <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> [...] " [...] and replied, [...] "You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan of yours, and when I was a kid just hanging out in Central Park I would talk to my friends about your work." [...] Following her hip surgery in February 2013, the singer was forced into a six-month hiatus, during which she studied literature and music with the Haus of Gaga in addition to sharing [...] "creative gifts". This stage allowed her to review and enhance her creative direction, which she admitted to be a meticulous [...] "gazing process". [...] "I have to gaze into the work {{for long periods of time}} for it to be good," [...] adding that upon analyzing her ideas, she received [...] "that wonderful feeling" [...] which told her [...] "that's the one".|$|E
50|$|These, {{with the}} {{assistance}} of my maid, I put on, and managed the first day to lace <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> in to eighteen inches.|$|R
60|$|Eve, who {{sat behind}} me, {{grasping}} <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> with both arms, swayed so heavily once or twice, as nearly to throw me down.|$|R
500|$|When Behan {{said he had}} {{disarmed}} them, Virgil {{attempted to}} avoid a fight. [...] "I had a walking stick in my left hand and my hand was on my six-shooter in <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> pants, and {{when he said he}} had disarmed them, I shoved it clean <b>around</b> to <b>my</b> left hip and changed my walking stick to my right hand." [...] Wyatt said I [...] "took my pistol, which I had in my hand, under my coat, and put it in my overcoat pocket." [...] The Earps walked further down Fremont street and came into full view of the Cowboys in the lot.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not despair, my friend. We have {{an extra}} anchor aboard, and I will tie it <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist,</b> to make me sink, and dive again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have the}} magic belt, you know," [...] said the little girl. [...] "If I buckled it <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> and {{commanded}} {{it to take}} me to Uncle Henry, wouldn't it do it?" ...|$|E
60|$|This last {{addition}} to my stock caused a considerable protuberance in front, which I abated in a measure by shaking {{the bits of}} bread <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist,</b> and distributing the plugs of tobacco among {{the folds of the}} garment.|$|E
5000|$|... "What your figure will be, {{goodness}} knows," [...] Ma warned her. [...] "When I was married, your Pa could span <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> {{with his}} two hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was about}} beseeching [...] In hurt haste [...] More meaning, when he, {{reaching}} [...] To <b>my</b> <b>waist,</b> Led me to pace the hall as once we paced.|$|R
60|$|I unclasped {{her hand}} from my gown while I spoke; but she slipped both her arms round <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> at the same moment, and held me more effectually than ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you must}} know, Jimmy," [...] she confided, {{dropping}} her voice, [...] "it's {{in a little}} compartment of a silk belt <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist.</b> It will remain there until I get to Washington, or until Mr. Haskall comes to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I am {{not built}} that way,” {{answered}} Dave, shortly. “I’ll put this <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist,</b> with the other,” he added, and lost {{no time in}} adjusting the second money-belt. It wasn’t particularly comfortable to wear those two belts, yet Dave felt a tremendous satisfaction in so doing.|$|E
60|$|He {{caught my}} hand in his, and devoured it with kisses. His lips burned me like fire. He twisted himself {{suddenly}} in the chair, and wound his arm <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist.</b> In the terror and indignation of the moment, vainly struggling with him, I cried out for help.|$|E
6000|$|He roos'd my een sae bonie blue, [...] He roos'd <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> sae genty sma'; [...] An' aye {{my heart}} cam to my mou', [...] When ne'er a body heard or saw.|$|R
6000|$|... "And let him {{put his arm}} round <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> and {{be happy}}. He will be happy because he will think of nothing beyond. But {{what is to be}} the end of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He cut {{a bit of}} rope {{from the}} raffle hanging from the spar, and tied one end round <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> and the other round his own, leaving about five fathoms loose between us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless your {{innocent}} heart, did {{you think}} you could hide any thing from me? Geordie couldn't keep a secret, and I'm only paying his debt, Pen dear, with the sort of interest women like," [...] Dick answered, with an audacious arm <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> and a brown beard close to my cheek.|$|E
60|$|I went on, {{the horse}} growing {{more and more}} feeble and blundering in his stride, until at last, {{when it was a}} case of {{dismount}} or do murder, I dropped stiffly from the saddle. Steel was down in a second, and in another my jacket and vest were off, and I laid my foot to the stirrup in white shirt and trousers, with a handkerchief knotted <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist.</b>|$|E
60|$|After a {{while they}} became less {{suspicious}} of us and then quite friendly in their brutish way. They picked at the fabric of our clothing, which seemed to interest them, and examined my rifle and pistol and the ammunition in the belt <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist.</b> I showed them the thermos-bottle, and when I poured a little water from it, they were delighted, thinking {{that it was a}} spring which I carried about with me--a never-failing source of water supply.|$|E
60|$|The bull charged on me with fury. As he did so, I {{took the}} spade {{and held it}} on a level with <b>my</b> <b>waist,</b> resting the butt end {{on the wall behind}} me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Free for to-day, and to-morrow, {{and next}} week, and next month--and next year too, for all I know to the contrary," [...] he answered, putting his arm boisterously round <b>my</b> <b>waist.</b> [...] "Look here!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Now I {{am proud}} of myself. Mistress has gotten me so that <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> is only fifteen inches. My corsets, too, are well laced together. Everybody admires <b>my</b> little <b>waist</b> ... I am not sorry that I am a model as after all I have gone through I am well looked after my mistress, and {{if she were to}} ask me to put on smaller corsets, I would do so.|$|R
60|$|Why should I try {{to recall}} his words? Nay! if I could, I would not set them down here! I felt every fiber of my nature glowing with delight as I listened; every chord seemed quivering with heart-stirring music. I {{had given up}} all idea of resistance. A strange drowsy peace had stolen in upon me. One of his arms was <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist,</b> and my hand was imprisoned in his. So we sat, and the moments became golden.|$|E
60|$|The last benches of that ridge taxed my waning strength. I {{had to step}} up, climb up, pull myself up, by {{hand and}} knee and body. My rifle grew to weigh a ton. My {{cartridge}} belt was a burden of lead <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist.</b> If I had been hot and wet below in the thicket I wondered what I grew on the last steps of this ridge. Yet even the toil and the pain held a keen pleasure. I did not analyze my feelings then, but {{it was good to}} be there.|$|E
60|$|I put my crowns in a belt <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist.</b> Another belt, or skin, {{was filled}} with rum, for the double purpose of buoying me in the water, and of comforting me when ashore. At that day, I found rum {{one of the great}} blessings of life; now I look upon it as one of the {{greatest}} evils. My companions made similar provisions of money and rum, though neither was as rich as myself. I left Mallet and Leonard Lewis my heirs at law if I escaped, and my trustees should I be caught. Lewis was a young man of better origin than most in the prison, and I have always thought some calamity drove him to the seas. He was in ill health, and did not appear to be destined to a long life. He would have joined us, heart and hand, but was not strong enough to endure the fatigue which we well knew we must undergo, before we could get clear.|$|E
60|$|Knowing that {{it would}} be folly to resist, I allowed them to do as Moran had advised. My wrists were knotted {{together}} behind my back, and then the cord was drawn tightly about <b>my</b> <b>waist.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I have a coil {{of leather}} thong, Sahib. I {{thought that it}} might be useful, if we wanted to bind a prisoner, or for any other purpose, so I stuffed it into <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> sash." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{lifted me}} up as though I {{had been a}} feather," [...] responded the girl. [...] "He just put his arm round <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> and had me on my feet before I knew where I was." ...|$|R
6000|$|Complete Bush-costume.--Mr. Gordon Cumming {{describes}} his bush-costume as follows:--"My own personal appointments {{consisted of a}} wide-awake hat, secured under my chin by 'rheimpys' or strips of dressed skin, a coarse linen shirt, sometimes a kilt, and sometimes a pair of buckskin knee-breeches, {{and a pair of}} 'veltschoens,' or home-made shoes. I entirely discarded coat, waistcoat, and neckcloth; and I always hunted with my arms bare; my heels were armed with a pair of powerful persuaders, and from my left wrist depended, by a double rheimpy (thong), an equally persuasive sea-cow jambok (whip of solid leather). <b>Around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> I wore two leathern belts or girdles. The smaller did the duty of suspender, and from it on my left side depended a plaited rheimpy, eight inches in length, forming a loop, in which dangled my powerful loading-rod, formed of a solid piece of horn of the rhinoceros. The larger girdle was my shooting-belt; this was a broad leather belt, on which were fastened four separate compartments, made of otterskin, with flaps to button over, of the same material. The first of these held my percussion-caps; the second, a large powder-flask; the third and fourth, which had divisions in them, contained balls and patches, two sharp clasp-knives, a compass, flint and steel. In this belt I also carried a loading-mallet, formed from the horn of the rhinoceros; this and the powder-flask were each secured to the belt by long rheimpys, to prevent my losing them. Last, but not least, in my right hand I usually carried my double-barrelled two-grooved rifle, which was my favourite weapon. This, however, I subsequently made up my mind was not the tool for a mounted man, especially when quick loading is required." ...|$|E
5000|$|He also {{dreamed of}} winning a world title. [...] "I see myself coming into the ring. I have the {{championship}} belt <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> ... and the lights go down, and the spotlight hits me. I hear all {{the girls in the}} audience screaming, 'Whoo-eee, look at Tyrone Everett.' How can I lose with all these girls screaming at me?" [...] Everett said.|$|E
5000|$|Travelers at U.S. {{airports}} {{have complained}} that when they opted not to be scanned, they were subjected to {{a new type of}} invasive pat-down that one traveler described as [...] "probing and pushing ... in my genital area." [...] Another traveler in the United States complained that the TSA employee [...] "inserted four fingers of both hands inside my trousers and ran his fingers all the way <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>waist,</b> his fingers extending at least 2-3 inches below my waistline." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, {{that comes}} of putting your arm where it's got no {{business}} to be," [...] she said. [...] "I always know when men try {{and put their}} arm round <b>my</b> <b>waist.</b> That pin always catches them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{give me your}} handkerchief. I {{will roll}} that and mine into a pad and shove it in, and put a bandage tightly round <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> to keep it there. That will do for the present.|$|R
5000|$|When I first {{accepted}} <b>my</b> situation, <b>my</b> <b>waist</b> {{was twenty}} inches. My mistress {{informed me that}} I would have to lace {{for the benefit of}} her customers and that I also must agree to sleep in her house.|$|R
