30|$|Hydrophobic organic {{compounds}} once released into soil become less available due to sorption and exhibit declined toxicity with time. Typically, the sorbed compounds become less accessible upon time {{and are therefore}} considered unavailable [54]. However, accumulation of organic pollutants in soils pose significant risks to human health and ecosystems [115], {{and there is still}} a large uncertainty on the best protocols for estimating their bioavailability in soil [113]. A large number of biosensors is also available for detection of either natural organic substances or organic pollutants, potentially very useful for characterization of risks posed by contaminated soils. Alkanes and derivatives can be detected using biosensors developed by inserting the alk regulon of Pseudomonas oleovorans, with the luxAB genes from V. harveyi, and the constructed plasmid transformed in E. coli DH 5 R which becomes bioluminescent specifically when exposed to linear alkanes, whereas biosensors for linear <b>alkylsulphonates</b> based on Nitrosomonas europaea [11] or Stenotrophomonas and Ralstonia strains [73] have been constructed by luxAB gene fusion with catabolic genes. Biosensors responding to bioavailable benzene, toluene and xylene (BTEX) in soil have been constructed by inserting the luxCDBAE or luc genes (lucFF is the firefly Photinus pyralis luciferase gene) in different plasmidial genes involved in the catabolic pathways of such compounds, using P. putida strains [6, 20] or E. coli [140]. Insertions of different reporter genes improve the sensitivity towards specific BTEX compounds because their degradation to pyruvate or acetaldehyde is controlled by several intermediate metabolites and enzymes. Sensitive gfp-based biosensors for the detection of toluene and benzene have been constructed by Stiner and Halvorsen [120] and Casavant et al. [22], inserting different plasmidial genes in P. fluorescent strains, and biosensor more specifically responding to benzene has been constructed by Di Gennaro et al. [30], and a comparative study on the lux- and gfp-based biosensors for the detection of toluene and related compounds in polluted soils was performed by Li et al. [65].|$|R
