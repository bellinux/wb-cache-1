5|$|Gameplay in Hatoful Boyfriend {{is similar}} to most other visual novels for the PC, with the {{controls}} limited to the mouse and the only interactions being clicking to forward the game's narrative or to choose between multiple plot choices. The keyboard {{can also be used}} instead of the mouse, with the 'enter' key serving the same purpose as clicking. The save button can be employed at any point during the game, which also features several pages of save slots, allowing gameplay to be easily picked up from prior to a choice the player made. An <b>arrow</b> <b>button</b> in the upper right corner also allows the player to skip dialogue and interactions they have already experienced.|$|E
500|$|The Start screen {{received}} several enhancements on Windows 8.1, including an extended [...] "All Apps" [...] view with sort modes (accessed by clicking a new down <b>arrow</b> <b>button</b> or swiping upward), small and extra-large sizes for tiles, and colored tiles for desktop program shortcuts. Additional customization options were also added, such as expanded color options, new backgrounds (some of which incorporate animated elements), {{and the ability}} for the Start screen to use the desktop background instead. Applications are no longer added to the Start screen automatically when installed, and all applications now have colored tiles (desktop programs were previously shown in a single color). The app snapping system has also been extended; up to four apps can be snapped onto a single display depending on screen size, apps can be snapped to fill half the screen, and {{can also be used}} on any display in a multi-monitor configuration. Apps can also launch other apps in a snapped view to display content; for example, the Mail app can open a photo attachment in a picture viewer snapped to another half of the screen. Improved support is also provided by apps for using devices in a portrait (vertical) orientation. The lock screen offers the ability to use a photo slideshow as its backdrop, and a shortcut to the Camera app by swiping up. The on-screen keyboard has an improved autocomplete mechanism which displays multiple word suggestions, and allows users to select from them by sliding on the spacebar. The autocomplete dictionary is also automatically updated using data from Bing, allowing it to recognize and suggest words relating to current trends and events. Similarly to Windows Phone, certain apps now display a narrow bar with three dots on it to indicate the presence of a pop-up menu accessible by swiping, clicking on the dots, or right-clicking.|$|E

5000|$|Dance Maniax is a dance {{game that}} uses four optical sensors to {{determine}} player movements. Sensors are positioned such {{that there are}} two top and two bottom sensors on each side. In addition, special options (such as center play, doubles, speed modifiers, etc.) are accessible by holding the left <b>arrow</b> <b>button,</b> the right <b>arrow</b> <b>button</b> and the start button after credits have been inserted but before the game has begun. Center play is where one player controls the middle two pairs of sensors. Also, doubles play is where one player controls all eight sensors at once. By default, players are presented with a set of predefined courses, and are able to select one per game, or should they have started the game into the [...] "options" [...] menu (by pressing both select buttons and the start button), they may also choose to define their own course, pre-set Internet Ranking, or pre-set Marathon courses.|$|E

50|$|The Moxi DVR {{features}} a user interface called the Moxi Menu. The Moxi Menu is presented fully in HD. It has a horizontal band {{that makes up}} the top level of menu choices. As users select a category on the horizontal band, choices within that category expand in a vertical list. When the user selects an item such as a channel {{or a piece of}} media, a popup menu gives them choices for that media, such as watch or record. The available choices vary {{depending on the type of}} item that is being accessed. If the user holds down an <b>arrow</b> <b>button</b> on the remote while navigating the menu, the menu scrolls by more quickly. A TV window in the upper right corner continues playing content while the menu is accessed.|$|E
50|$|Newer models {{such as the}} LaserJet 600 series {{now include}} a full color LCD display. Two {{directional}} <b>arrow</b> <b>buttons</b> and a Ok button replace the multiple menu navigation buttons of the 4000 series.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{framework}} of perceptuo-motor theories of speech perception, {{it has been argued}} that speech articulation could play a role in speech perception. Indeed, recent finding demonstrates that somatosensory inputs associated with speaking motion changes the perception of speech sounds. However, it is still unknown whether somatosensory effects could go up to the level of lexical access in speech comprehension. Access to lexical information depends on a complex word segmentation process. This study aims to examine whether segmentation and lexical information processing could be changed by somatosensory inputs associated with facial skin deformation. We here focus on “elisions” between definite article and noun in French (e. g. “l’affiche” [the poster] or “la fiche” [the form]), which have the same pronunciation, but can be differentiated by hyper-articulation for the production of the first vowel in each word. If somatosensory information plays a role in lexical information processing, we reasoned that the perception of such sequences could be changed if somatosensory stimulation was applied in an appropriate timing associated to the corresponding speech gesture. To test this, we applied somatosensory perturbation associated with facial skin deformation at different timings along the presentation of the auditory stimulation. We tested native speakers of French who performed a two-alternative forced choice task between the two percepts associated to a single speech sequence. The stimulation sound was presented through headphones within the carrier phrase “C’est ___ (This is ___) ”. Participants identified which word was presented (i. e. “affiche” vs. “fiche”) by pressing the left or right <b>arrow</b> <b>button</b> on the keyboard as quickly as possible. We used 17 different ambiguous speech sentences recorded by a native French speaker. Utterances were pronounced neutrally without adding hyper-articulation in any single vowel, that is, removing as much as possible acoustic information for decision. For each audio sentence, we applied a somatosensory stimulation consisting in facial skin stretch perturbation, generated by a robotic device. We varied the time of presentation of this facial skin stretch perturbation, with 8 different temporal positions within an acoustic sentence. These temporal positions were set relative to the timing of the first vowel peak amplitude (i. e. “a” in the previous example), separated by 100 ms intervals from - 400 ms (around the vowel in “c’est”) to 300 ms (around the second vowel, i. e. “i” in the previous example). In each combination of audio and somatosensory stimulation, four subject’s responses were recorded, with a total of 544 stimuli (17 sentences * 8 timing conditions * 4 repetitions) presented in a random order. The judgement probability (i. e. percentage of “la fiche” responses) was calculated for each subject and each timing condition. It appears that the percentage of judgement probability was reduced when somatosensory stimulation was ahead of the first vowel (more “l’affiche” responses), and increased when somatosensory stimulation was delayed between the first and second vowel (more “la fiche” responses). This suggests that somatosensory information intervenes in the processing of lexical information, which corresponds to a relatively higher level of processing of speech perception...|$|E

50|$|Unlike the Animas Ping {{which has}} a locking feature that is undone by {{pressing}} both {{the up and down}} <b>arrow</b> <b>buttons,</b> the Deltec Cozmo had a number locking feature. The purpose of this feature was somewhat defeated by pump trainers encouraging the use of 14 as the code number. The Deltec Cozmo also used a different scrolling mechanism than the Animas Ping. On the Ping pump holding down the up or down button causes a change in one number then increments by five and on the Ping meter the numbers slowly climb to 5 then abruptly change speed, going from 5 to 110 in the same time it took to go from 0-5; on the Cozmo the scrolling speed slowly accelerated the longer the button was held down. This allowed the pumper to get to high values relatively fast and then still get to the exact value they wanted.|$|R
