5|$|During Hamilton's {{tenure as}} Treasury Secretary, {{political}} factions began to emerge. A Congressional caucus, led by James Madison and William Branch Giles, {{began as an}} opposition group to Hamilton's financial programs, and Thomas Jefferson joined this group {{when he returned from}} France. Hamilton and his allies began to call themselves Federalists. The opposition group, now called the Democratic-Republican Party by political scientists, was at the time known <b>as</b> <b>Republicans.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, {{even among}} Senate Republicans, there were {{conflicting}} views. Senators Arlen Specter and Lindsey Graham (the latter a former military prosecutor) indicated Congress would work quickly to authorize tribunals, while influential Senator John Warner suggested a cautious and deliberative response. The potential for Congressional action also provided an avenue for politicking, <b>as</b> <b>Republicans</b> threatened Democratic members of Congress with being labeled weak on terrorism {{if they did}} not authorize tribunals.|$|E

5|$|A {{week after}} the election, Downey {{announced}} that he was resigning for health reasons. Warren appointed Nixon to the short remainder of Downey's term; under the Senate rules at the time, this gave Nixon seniority over the senators sworn in during January. Nixon took office on December 4, 1950. He used little of his seniority, since in November 1952 he was elected vice president as Dwight Eisenhower's running mate, the next step on a path that would lead him to the presidency in 1969. Downey, who as a former senator retained floor privileges, was hired as a lobbyist by oil interests. In 1952, <b>as</b> <b>Republicans</b> took over the White House and control of both houses of Congress, he was fired. An aide stated that the big corporations did not need Downey anymore. Boddy, dispirited by his election defeat and feeling let down by the average citizens for whom he had sought to advocate, lapsed into semi-retirement after his primary defeat. In 1952, he sold his interest in the Daily News, which went into bankruptcy in December 1954.|$|E
5|$|While the war {{was still}} being waged, Lincoln faced reelection in 1864. Lincoln was a master politician, {{bringing}} together—and holding together—all the main factions of the Republican Party, and bringing in War Democrats such as Edwin M. Stanton and Andrew Johnson as well. Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket. At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well <b>as</b> <b>Republicans,</b> Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party.|$|E
