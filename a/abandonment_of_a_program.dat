50|$|In {{the modern}} period, {{language}} death has typically {{resulted from the}} process of cultural assimilation leading to language shift, and the gradual <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> native language in favour <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foreign lingua franca.|$|R
50|$|Prehistoric {{settlement}} {{patterns in}} Central Europe are generally quite volatile.

40|$|In <b>a</b> state <b>of</b> law, <b>a</b> citizen {{must live}} under the {{protection}} of their fundamental rights. Therefore, when authorities makes an intervention in a family nucleus and separates children from their parents for alleged protection purposes, {{it should be noted that}} if the decision was misguided, during the time that the separation remains, fundamental rights of the whole family are being infringed, especially for children, as stated in Article 9 of the CRC. With these premises, this article reveals that the reasons <b>of</b> risk and <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child should be typified in order to ensure the full success of the decisions of family separation. In addition, following <b>a</b> declaration <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child, a lawsuit should be arise, whose procedural aspects would ensure fully adequate protection of the fundamental rights of the child in question, regardless of their parents' litigator ability...|$|R

40|$|Marx’s {{thought is}} being reappropriated and reinterpreted by <b>a</b> new {{generation}} <b>of</b> activists {{in their own}} struggles.
