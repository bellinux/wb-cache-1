5|$|A {{personal}} dive {{computer is}} a small computer designed to be worn by a diver during <b>a</b> <b>dive,</b> with a pressure sensor and an electronic timer mounted in a waterproof and pressure resistant housing which has been programmed to model the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues in real time during <b>a</b> <b>dive.</b> A display allows the diver to see critical data during the dive, including the maximum and current depth, duration of the dive, and decompression data including the remaining no decompression limit calculated in real time for the diver throughout the dive. The dive computer keeps track of residual gas loading for each tissue used in the algorithm. Dive computers also provide a measure of safety for divers who accidentally dive a different profile to that originally planned. Most dive computers will provide the necessary decompression information for acceptably safe ascent {{in the event that}} the no-decompression limits are exceeded. The use of computers to manage recreational dive decompression is becoming the standard and their use is also common in occupational scientific diving. Their value in surface supplied commercial diving is more restricted, but they can usefully serve as <b>a</b> <b>dive</b> profile recorder.|$|E
50|$|Semi-final: 28 August — Each diver {{performed}} four <b>dives</b> out of <b>a</b> group {{consisting of}} <b>a</b> front <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> back <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> reverse <b>dive,</b> <b>an</b> inward <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> twisting <b>dive</b> and <b>an</b> armstand <b>dive.</b> The 12 divers {{with the highest}} combined score from the semi-final and preliminary dives advanced to the final.|$|R

5|$|A valve failed on a diver’s {{emergency}} cylinder on {{a diving}} support vessel during preparation for <b>a</b> <b>dive</b> injuring five divers. The cylinder valve was ejected at 180 bar due to incompatible thread. Pillar valve was M25x2 parallel thread and cylinder was a 3/4″x14 BSP parallel thread.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook took a single from Lindwall, who then removed Emmett for a duck. The paceman pitched an outswinger on the off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who took it {{in his right hand}} while taking <b>a</b> <b>dive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Each tissue {{compartment}} {{is assumed}} to fully saturate/desaturate in 6 half-times. This means desaturation of the slowest (120 min) compartment takes 12 hours – hence the 12-hour surface interval before <b>a</b> <b>dive</b> is not considered repetitive with these tables.|$|E

5|$|The Ju 87 V1, {{powered by}} a Rolls-Royce Kestrel V12 {{cylinder}} liquid-cooled engine, and with a twin tail, crashed on 24 January 1936 at Kleutsch near Dresden, killing Junkers' chief test pilot, Willy Neuenhofen, and his engineer, Heinrich Kreft. The square twin fins and rudders proved too weak; they collapsed and the aircraft crashed after it entered an inverted spin during the testing of the terminal dynamic pressure in <b>a</b> <b>dive.</b> The crash prompted a change to a single vertical stabiliser tail design. To withstand strong forces during <b>a</b> <b>dive,</b> heavy plating was fitted, along with brackets riveted to the frame and longeron, to the fuselage. Other early additions included the installation of hydraulic dive brakes that were fitted under the leading edge and could rotate 90°.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} <b>a</b> <b>Dive</b> Coaster can vary {{slightly}} {{from one to}} another. Depending on the amusement park's request, one row on the train can seat anywhere from 6 to 10 riders. Stadium seating {{is also used to}} give every rider a clear view. Next, compared to standard Bolliger & Mabillard 4 abreast cars, because of the extra weight of each car on <b>a</b> <b>Dive</b> Coaster, the size of the track must be larger than other B models (such as the Hyper Coaster) to support the weight. At the top of the primary vertical drop, a braking system holds the train for 3 to 5 seconds, giving riders a view of the drop ahead before being released into the drop.|$|E
50|$|Preliminary round: 25 August — Each diver {{performed}} <b>a</b> front <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> back <b>dive,</b> <b>a</b> reverse <b>dive,</b> <b>an</b> inward <b>dive</b> and <b>a</b> twisting <b>dive.</b> There were no {{limitations in}} degree of difficulty.

50|$|<b>A</b> major <b>diving</b> {{project or}} {{offshore}} installation {{may also have}} <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> superintendent on staff. The diving superintendent is usually <b>a</b> senior <b>diving</b> supervisor appointed by the diving contractor and {{is responsible for the}} overall planning and conduct of diving work, and will be responsible for allocating <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> supervisor for each diving operation.|$|R
5000|$|HMNZS Manawanui (A09) was {{commissioned}} in 1988 as <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> support vessel for the Royal New Zealand Navy. Originally she was built as <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> support vessel, the Star Perseus, for North Sea oil rig operations.|$|R
5|$|A {{decompression}} {{algorithm is}} used to calculate the decompression stops needed for a particular dive profile {{to reduce the risk of}} decompression sickness occurring after surfacing at the end of <b>a</b> <b>dive.</b> The algorithm can be used to generate decompression schedules for a particular dive profile, decompression tables for more general use, or be implemented in dive computer software.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} stop is {{a period}} a diver must spend at a relatively shallow constant depth during ascent after <b>a</b> <b>dive</b> to safely eliminate absorbed inert gases from the body tissues to avoid decompression sickness. The practice of making decompression stops is called staged decompression, as opposed to continuous decompression.|$|E
5|$|A jonline {{can also}} be used to tether the diver's {{equipment}} to the dive boat before or after the dive. This helps the diver to put on or take off the equipment while in the water without drifting away from the boat. It is similar to a buddy line, which is used to tether two divers together during <b>a</b> <b>dive.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>diving</b> {{cylinder}}, scuba tank or <b>diving</b> tank is <b>a</b> {{gas cylinder}} used to store and transport the high pressure breathing gas required by a scuba set. It {{may also be}} used for surface-supplied diving or as decompression gas or an emergency gas supply for surface supplied diving or scuba. Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the demand valve of <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> regulator or the breathing loop of <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> rebreather.|$|R

25|$|In some jurisdictions {{there will}} also be <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> medical {{practitioner}} on standby, but not necessarily on site, and some companies may require <b>a</b> <b>diving</b> medical technician on site.
