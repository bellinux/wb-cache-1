5|$|A {{convenient}} {{means of}} determining {{the order of a}} given sigmatropic rearrangement is to number the <b>atoms</b> of the bond being broken as atom 1, and then count the <b>atoms</b> in each direction from the broken bond to the <b>atoms</b> that form the new σ-bond in the product, numbering consecutively. The numbers that correspond to the <b>atoms</b> forming the new bond are then separated by a comma and placed within brackets to create the sigmatropic reaction order descriptor.|$|E
5|$|In 1857, German chemist August Kekulé {{observed}} that carbon often has four other <b>atoms</b> bonded to it.

5|$|The {{amount of}} energy needed to remove or add an {{electron}}—the electron binding energy—is {{far less than the}} binding energy of nucleons. For example, it requires only 13.6eV to strip a ground-state electron from a hydrogen atom, compared to 2.23million eV for splitting a deuterium nucleus. <b>Atoms</b> are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. <b>Atoms</b> that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby <b>atoms</b> or shared between <b>atoms.</b> By this mechanism, <b>atoms</b> are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals.|$|E

5|$|The {{substitution}} of hydrogen <b>atoms</b> in an alkane by progressively more fluorine <b>atoms</b> gradually alters several properties: melting and boiling points are lowered, density increases, solubility in hydrocarbons decreases and overall stability increases. Perfluorocarbons, {{in which all}} hydrogen <b>atoms</b> are substituted, are insoluble in most organic solvents, reacting at ambient conditions only with sodium in liquid ammonia.|$|E
5|$|Although the heme {{proteins}} are {{the most}} important class of iron-containing proteins, the iron-sulfur proteins are also very important, being involved in electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron <b>atoms</b> that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, they always have high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is rubredoxin, which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur <b>atoms</b> from cysteine residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the ferredoxins, which have multiple iron <b>atoms.</b> Transferrin does not belong to either of these classes.|$|E
5|$|An atom is the {{smallest}} constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element.

5|$|<b>Atoms</b> lack a {{well-defined}} outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually {{described in terms}} of an atomic radius. This {{is a measure of the}} distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus. However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for <b>atoms</b> in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two <b>atoms</b> are joined in a chemical bond. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring <b>atoms</b> (coordination number) and a quantum mechanical property known as spin. On the periodic table of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right). Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32pm, while one of the largest is caesium at 225pm.|$|E
5|$|Chalcogens have diverse fluorides: {{unstable}} difluorides {{have been}} reported for oxygen (the only known compound with oxygen in an oxidation state of +2), sulfur, and selenium; tetrafluorides and hexafluorides exist for sulfur, selenium, and tellurium. The latter are stabilized by more fluorine <b>atoms</b> and lighter central <b>atoms,</b> so sulfur hexafluoride is especially inert. Chlorine, bromine, and iodine can each form mono-, tri-, and pentafluorides, but only iodine heptafluoride has been characterized among possible interhalogen heptafluorides. Many of them are powerful sources of fluorine <b>atoms,</b> and industrial applications using chlorine trifluoride require precautions similar to those using fluorine.|$|E
5|$|Charged leptons {{can combine}} with other {{particles}} to form various composite particles such as <b>atoms</b> and positronium.

50|$|Thiol-disulfide {{exchange}} is a chemical reaction {{in which a}} thiolate group -S− attacks a sulfur <b>atom</b> of a disulfide bond -S-S-. The original disulfide bond is broken, and its other sulfur <b>atom</b> (green <b>atom</b> in Figure 1) is released as a new thiolate, carrying away the negative charge.

5|$|Diamonds {{containing}} boron as a substitutional impurity are termed type IIb. Only {{one percent}} of natural diamonds are of this type, and most are blue to grey. Boron is an acceptor in diamond: boron <b>atoms</b> have one less available electron than the carbon atoms; therefore, each boron atom substituting for a carbon atom creates an electron hole in the band gap that can accept an electron from the valence band. This allows red light absorption, and due to the small energy (0.37 eV) needed for the electron to leave the valence band, holes can be thermally released from the boron <b>atoms</b> to the valence band even at room temperatures. These holes can move in an electric field and render the diamond electrically conductive (i.e., a p-type semiconductor). Very few boron <b>atoms</b> are required for this to happen—a typical ratio is one boron atom per 1,000,000 carbon <b>atoms.</b>|$|E
