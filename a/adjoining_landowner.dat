His friend William Tooke had purchased a considerable estate, including Purley Lodge, south of the town of Croydon in Surrey. The possession of this property brought about frequent disputes with an <b>adjoining</b> <b>landowner,</b> Thomas de Grey, and, after many actions in the courts, Thomas de Grey's friends endeavoured to obtain, by a bill forced through the houses of parliament, the privileges which the law had not assigned to him (February 1774). Horne, thereupon, by a bold libel on the Speaker, drew public attention to the case, and though he himself was placed for a time in the custody of the serjeant-at-arms, the clauses which were injurious to the interest of Tooke were eliminated from the bill. Tooke declared his intention of making Horne the heir to his fortune, and during his lifetime he bestowed upon him large gifts of money.|$|E

40|$|A {{landowner}} {{builds a}} house that encroaches two feet on his neighbor 2 ̆ 7 s property. The encroachment involves very little land, but it creates many issues for the respective landowners. In today 2 ̆ 7 s society, where subdivisions are developed daily, there is an increasing potential for encroachments due to innocent mistakes, negligence, or willfulness. When an encroachment occurs, it would be terrific if the parties could negotiate a fair solution, but this rarely happens. This is because the law automatically places an encroaching landowner in an inferior bargaining position. In North Carolina, courts will order the encroaching landowner to remove the encroachment regardless of his intent. Therefore, the encroaching landowner must meet the neighbor 2 ̆ 7 s demands for waiving a mandatory injunction to compel removal or prepare to move the encroaching portion of the structure. This Article addresses the public policy and equitable issues sparked by the encroachment of a permanent structure on an <b>adjoining</b> <b>landowner</b> 2 ̆ 7 s property. It focuses on the equitable hardship doctrine, which is commonly invoked by many jurisdictions in encroachment cases and applied when the circumstances of a given case justify superseding the landowner 2 ̆ 7 s ordinary remedy to an injunction-a doctrine which North Carolina has paid lip service to but does not apply. The analysis in this Article leads {{to the conclusion that}} in determining whether to grant an injunction, a court must balance the equities by assessing the relative hardship of each party. Application of the equitable hardship doctrine in encroachment cases will prevent economic waste, the potential for extortion, and unnecessary litigation, and create a just result for both parties...|$|E

40|$|Among {{the many}} human-wildlife {{conflicts}} that occur across North America, {{some of the}} most contentious occur at the interface of urban and suburban lands and adjoining rural landscapes. Along the Colorado Front Range, one of the more difficult situations faced by local governments and municipalities involves black-tailed prairie dog colonies. These colonies are relicts of the expansive colonies that once occurred across much of the prairies of North America. Although these colonies are relatively small and, usually, highly fragmented, they represent an important link to our natural history, provide a valuable wildlife-viewing experience and allow the promotion of public education about intact prairie ecosystems and their components. Some of the colonies, especially if eventually linked to other nearby ones, may help to prevent the federal listing of the black-tailed prairie dog as a threatened species and may play in a role in the recovery of the black-footed ferret, perhaps the most endangered mammal in North America. Additionally, many of the urban-suburban colonies are being used by many of the wildlife species associated with prairie dog colonies. Most of these colonies are continuously under the threat of development or other disruptive human activities.

50|$|The {{year before}} the Battle of Gettysburg, McConaughy had envisioned a Soldiers' Cemetery as part of Evergreen Cemetery. At the time, only two Gettysburg men {{had been killed in}} combat, so there was not enough support from the {{community}} to fund the project. In the days after the battle, he ordered the wife of cemetery caretaker Peter Thorn (who was off serving in the army) to bury nearly one hundred soldiers' bodies in Evergreen Cemetery. Within six weeks, McConaughy initiated efforts to form a National Cemetery as a central resting place for the thousands of slain Union soldiers that had been buried at widely scattered graves throughout the Gettysburg region. Having already laid the groundwork for his concept by previously talking to the <b>adjoining</b> <b>landowners,</b> McConaughy acquired purchasing rights for the 17 acre of land immediately north of Evergreen Cemetery. By doing so, McConaughy foiled rival lawyer David Wills's plans to purchase the land for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He began buying lots on Cemetery Hill with his own money and asked veterans to contribute financially. The National Cemetery was dedicated November 19, 1863, in ceremonies that included Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. McConaughy soon left the presidency of the Evergreen Cemetery Association to help establish the Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association, serving as its first president for ten years. He served as an Elector for Lincoln in the 1864 presidential campaign.|$|R

5000|$|The {{operation}} of the Pasminco smelter {{for over a century}} resulted in soil contamination of surrounding areas such as Boolaroo, Argenton and Speers Point by lead and other heavy metals. During the last decades of its operation local opposition to the pollution produced by its activities began to develop but was stymied by skillful public relations which emphasized the economic benefits which accrued to the local community. Following cessation of its operations due to insolvency and appointment of the insolvency practitioner Ferrier Hodgson as voluntary administrator in September 2001 under the Corporations Act 2001 there was environmental remediation of the site of smelter and nearby properties with some buyouts and teardowns; aid in removing 5 centimeters of contaminated soil was extended to 18 <b>adjoining</b> <b>landowners</b> with contamination of 2,500 parts per million or more of lead. This partial cleanup was signed off on by the state government which in 2008 released Pasminco from a 1995 requirement that adjoining properties with lead levels above 600 parts per million be remediated, substituting a much less stringent [...] "lead abatement strategy" [...] (There is no mechanism in Australia analogous to the Superfund mechanism in the United States). Much of the soil in the surrounding area remains hazardous waste, however, and could not be deposited in a local tip. Pasminco was restructured in 2002 by Ferrier Hodgson, its voluntary administrator, as Zinifex. Zinifex was merged into OZ Minerals, then purchased by the Chinese state-owned China Minmetals, which then, with Australian participation, formed Minerals and Metals Group. The successor in interest to Pasminco has apparently been able to avoid continuing legal liability by virtue of skillful legal structuring of the transaction transferring the interest.

40|$|This study explores Australian {{small-scale}} rural lifestyle landowners’ {{perceptions of}} and experiences with natural resource management (NRM) extension and incentive programmes and discusses means to better-match such programmes to these landowners’ NRM interests, assistance needs and delivery preferences. Data was collected from seventeen in-depth qualitative case-studies of small-acreage landholders {{located in the}} Noosa hinterland in south-east Queensland. These landholders indicated a high need for expert advice, labour and other resource assistance to achieve their property management objectives. They had, however, a low-level of awareness and understanding of available programmes (particularly incentive schemes) that could provide some of their needed support. Other key barriers to the landholders’ participation in these programmes were aversions to support providers, a perceived unsuitability of properties or irrelevance of particular incentive programmes, and concerns about programme application procedures or property-rights and value-related implications of engagement. Increased NRM engagement among small-scale lifestyle landowners may be achievable through amendments to existing support programmes and better communication of these programmes. The design and delivery of appropriate measures and messages may require collaborative partnerships, with knowledgeable and influential ‘go-to’ landowners and peer-mentoring networks playing a critical role. In many cases, conservation-focused incentive programmes may need to facilitate cooperative NRM among groups of <b>adjoining</b> micro-scale lifestyle <b>landowners</b> and allow greater flexibility in the length and allowable land and forest management practices of contractual agreements. Moreover, small-scale lifestyle landowners have much interest in and need for support to integrate multi-purpose agroforestry systems with other environmental and aesthetic property management goals. Workshops, follow-up field-days on participating properties, free one-on-one on-property advice, and NRM guides that include detailed case-study accounts of landowner experiences are important means of communicating the availability, administrative requirements and benefits of support programmes to small-scale lifestyle landowners. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} African wild dogs Lycaon pictus in Northern KwaZulu‐Natal, South Africa has {{increased}} substantially {{over the last}} six years. This is largely due to a managed metapopulation approach of introductions onto protected areas and private game reserves since 1998. Because of the increasing wild dog population, the likelihood of rural communities surrounding protected areas encountering dispersing wild dogs in northern KwaZulu‐Natal has also increased. Resident wild dog populations currently occur in Hluhluwe‐iMfolozi Park (HiP), Mkhuze Game Reserve (MGR) of Isimangaliso Wetland Park and Thanda Private Game Reserve (TPGR) all of which are bordered by a matrix of natural habitats and human settlements. Thus, land outside these protected areas could be utilized to expand wild dog distribution and provide connectivity between existing resident populations of wild dogs within KwaZulu‐Natal. To investigate the viability of such an approach, Maximum Entropy Modelling (Maxent) was used to characterize habitat niche selection of dispersing wild dogs, and to identify potential dispersal linkages between current wild dog metapopulation reserves. The model was calibrated using 132 location points collected from 2006 until 2009. From 2008 to 2009 I also conducted a survey of 247 community members in tribal authorities bordering HiP and MGR, to understand factors influencing attitudes towards wild dogs. A habitat suitability model with seven predictor variables had an AUC of 0. 96 (SD = 0. 02) and indicated four variables which best predicted probability of presence for dispersing wild dogs: elevation, road density, land cover and human density. The results suggest that elevation and land cover may be of greater influence for dispersing wild dogs than human density or activity. Elevation was the single most effective variable indicating a higher probability of presence for dispersing wild dogs in lower lying locations; peaking at approximately 200 – 300 m a. s. l. Wild dogs also showed a preference for Woodland and Bushland habitats which in KwaZulu‐Natal tend to be found on lower lying topography. A preference for areas of lower human density and a highest probability of presence at road densities of approximately 0. 7 km/km 2 or less would suggest that while wild dogs may show a tendency to avoid areas of high human activity, they can coexist in close proximity to humans. Respondent’s attitudes, knowledge of wild dogs and livestock husbandry were interpreted by the development of a set of indices. Attitudes were positively related to formal education levels and wild dog‐specific education, but were not influenced by demographic factors such as gender, age and employment status. Eighty three percent of respondents believed efforts to protect wild dogs should continue. Respondents with higher numbers of livestock tended to have more positive attitudes towards wild dogs despite generally incurring higher losses to carnivore depredation than those with less livestock. This appears to be because the financial burden of livestock losses to those with fewer livestock is perceived to be a loss of a greater proportion of total financial wealth. The study highlighted the substantial scope for improvement in livestock management. Theft (34 percent), drought (30 percent) and disease (14 percent) were ranked as the greatest problems facing livestock owners while predators were ranked as the greatest problem by only 4 percent of respondents. My findings suggest that wild dogs are generally viewed positively or with ambivalence. Concerns over the potentially increasing threat to livestock, as natural prey numbers outside protected areas decline and wild dogs disperse from natal packs, are likely to be manageable. However, wild dog population expansion within KwaZulu‐Natal will continue to rely on managed core populations on perimeter‐fenced metapopulation reserves with tolerant communities and landowners contributing to the connectivity of isolated reserves. Generation of tolerance can be instilled through continued advocacy and education, supported by conflict mitigation initiatives and rapid response to conflict reports. The implementation of incentive schemes for <b>adjoining</b> private <b>landowners</b> to co‐manage wild dog populations will need to be addressed in conjunction with managed metapopulation practices and law enforcement, to promote range expansion, and reduce potentially lethal edge effects and wild dog‐human conflict...|$|R
