2500|$|Although TMC {{was carried}} by most {{subscription}} television providers, {{there were some}} {{that did not have}} agreements to carry the channel, even if they already carried Showtime. As an example, now-defunct satellite provider Primestar never carried The Movie Channel; weeks after it announced a new carriage agreement with Viacom in January 1999 that would have resulted in the channel joining the provider's lineup, Primestar sold its assets to Hughes Communications (then-owners of competitor DirecTV, which would neither carry Viacom's premium and basic cable services nor Time Warner's premium channels until its 2001 acquisition of United States Satellite Broadcasting). In May 1994, TCI dropped The Movie Channel from more than 30 of the cable provider's service markets. At the time, Viacom {{was in the midst of}} an antitrust lawsuit against TCI on accusations that the provider engaged in a [...] "conspiracy to eliminate" [...] Showtime and its sister channels (including TMC) and pressuring Viacom to settle its lawsuit through the negotiation of a carriage contract with the media company that expired in January 1993; Viacom reportedly stated that TCI threatened to hurt both Showtime and TMC unless Viacom agreed to purchase an ownership stake in Encore (now Starz Encore), a network which Viacom claimed to have first conceptually conceived four years earlier during negotiations between the two companies that, if they had been successful, would have resulted in TCI purchasing 50% of Showtime Networks. Representatives for the affected TCI systems said that the decision to remove The Movie Channel from their lineups was made at the local level and was not a directive by company management. Viacom and TCI settled the Showtime Networks distribution dispute in January 1995, preceding the former's $2.3-billion sale of its Viacom Cablevision systems to TCI <b>affiliate</b> <b>company</b> Intermedia Partners.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the function of}} corporate governance of the zaibatsu holding companies. Since 19 th century, {{or in some cases}} since 17 th century, zaibatsu accumulated assets and diversified them into various businesses. Expansion and diversification of the businesses caused problems which resulted from asymmetric information, namely adverse selection and moral hazard of the agents who executed the businesses. In order to resolve these problems, zaibatsu introduced organizational innovation. By early 1920 's, each zaibatsu established the holding company, while it separated the businesses into joint-stock companies. The holding company of zaibatsu had the organizations and full-time stuffs to monitor the <b>affiliated</b> <b>companies.</b> In many cases, the concerning sections of the holding company, such as the section of audit, inspection etc., checked the budget and financial data of the <b>affiliated</b> <b>companies,</b> while the matters {{of the board of directors}} were approved by the holding company ex ante and ex post. There existed systematic rules on the allocation of powers between the holding <b>company</b> and the <b>affiliated</b> <b>companies.</b> Also, the holding company frequently dispatched directors to the <b>affiliated</b> <b>companies.</b> The efficacy of these devices of governance was tested quantitatively. We compared ROE between zaibatsu affiliated firms and non-zaibatsu firms, using panel data of 135 firms from 1922 to 1936. By controlling the effects of company scale, industry-specific shocks, and macro-shocks, we obtained the result that zaibatsu-affiliated firms clearly outperformed the other companies. This result supports the hypothesis that the zaibatsu holding company played the role of monitoring the <b>affiliated</b> <b>companies.</b> Besides this governance function concerning the <b>affiliated</b> <b>companies,</b> zaibatsu also disciplined the non-affiliated companies in the capital market. The holding companies and the core <b>affiliated</b> <b>companies</b> frequently executed take over, which contributed to restructure the targeted companies, thorough replacement of the directors, assistance of management. ...|$|R
