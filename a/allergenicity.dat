25|$|Allergies, while a {{critical}} subject of immunology, also vary considerably among individuals {{and sometimes even}} among genetically similar individuals. The assessment of protein allergenic potential focuses on three main aspects: (i) immunogenicity; (ii) cross-reactivity; and (iii) clinical symptoms. Immunogenicity is due to responses of an IgE antibody-producing B cell and/or of a T cell to a particular allergen. Therefore, immunogenicity studies focus mainly on identifying recognition sites of B-cells and T-cells for allergens. The three-dimensional structural properties of allergens control their <b>allergenicity.</b>|$|E

The species Paratrichocladius rufiventris and Cricotopus sylvestris showed high positive rates of specific IgE, high average IgE reactivities and high frequencies of strong IgE reactivity {{and the highest}} IgE reactivity of the 22 species, suggesting {{a high rate of}} contact with humans and the possession of highly allergenic components by these two species. In contrast, Tanypus punctipennis and Rheotanytarsus kyotoensis showed low <b>allergenicities,</b> suggesting a low level of human contact and/or a lack of allergenic components. Furthermore, species that emerge from eutrophic waters in a large mass, such as Macropelopia paranebulosa, Paratrichocladius rufiventris and Chironomus yoshimatsui, showed strong <b>allergenicities</b> in all the tests.

Possible native allergen proteins were purified from the wasp venoms (WV) (Vespa magnifica Smith) by gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, respectively. Their sequences were determined by Edman degradation and cDNA cloning. Their <b>allergenicities</b> were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inhibition tests (ELISA-IT), immunoblots, and skin prick tests (SPTs). Their cross allergencities with Tab y 2 and Tab y 5 purified from the horsefly (Tabanus yao Macquart) were also determined. Two native allergens were identified from the WV, respectively. They are a 25 -KDa antigen 5 protein (Ag 5) (Vesp ma 5) and a 35 -KDa hyaluronidase (Vesp ma 2). They represented major allergens in Vespa magnifica by immunoblots and SPTs. ELISA inhibition of pooled sera IgE reactivity to both the WV and the horsefly salivary gland extracts (HSGE) using four purified allergens (Vesp ma 2, Vesp ma 5 and previously purified Tab y 2 and Tab y 5) was significant.

40|$|Background: Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is {{exacerbated by}} sweating, and the skin of most patients with AD are resided by Malassezia (M.) fungi. Recently, MGL_ 1304 produced by Malassezia globosa was identified as the major histamine releasing antigen in human sweat. Methods: The full length cDNA of the counterpart of MGL_ 1304 in Malassezia restricta (Mala r 8), was cloned by degenerate PCR and rapid identification of cDNA ends (RACE). Recombinant MGL_ 1304, and its counterparts, Mala s 8 (produced by Malassezia sympodialis) and Mala r 8 were prepared, and compared in their <b>allergenicities</b> by dot blot analysis and histamine release tests with sera and basophils of patients with AD. Results: The identities between MGL_ 1304 and Mala s 8, MGL_ 1304 and Mala r 8, and Mala s 8 and Mala r 8 were 68 %, 78 %, and 76 %, respectively, in protein sequences. Dot blot analysis revealed {{that the level of}} IgE binding to Mala s 8 was higher than that of MGL_ 1304. However, histamine release tests revealed that MGL_ 1304 and Mala r 8 possessed higher activity than Mala s 8. In addition, the crude lysate of M.  globosa showed higher histamine release ability than that of M.  sympodialis. Conclusions: Patients with AD showed hypersensitivities against MGL_ 1304 and its homologs. However, the <b>allergenicities</b> of the homologs are variable and the histamine release activities may be different from the solid-phase binding activities for IgE. Sweat allergy should be carefully evaluated with biological activities of MGL_ 1304 and its homologs of other Malassezia fungi residing on the skin...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundWild birch trees grow {{in limited}} areas in Japan {{and are not}} a common aero-allergen. However, many {{patients}} who {{do not live in}} the area show positive birch pollen Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST). Therefore, being sensitized by another tree pollen which is closely related to birch may result in showing a specific IgE antibody to birch. Alder is a one of these trees and in the past it grew widely in Japan. However, there is no available RAST data as to the correlations between alder and alder-related trees. MethodsWe measured the alder specific IgE (CAP-RAST, Phadea) in stored sera which was positive in birch RAST (228 samples), beech RAST (36 samples), oak RAST (152 samples) and cedar RAST (411 samples) and examined correlations between the RAST of alder and other trees. ResultsThe correlation coefficient value of birch was very high (0. 971). The other coefficient values of beech and oak were high (0. 884 in beech and 0. 895 in oak) but were slightly lower than that of the birch. This means that in terms of <b>allergenicities,</b> birch pollen is almost the same as alder and beech and oak are partly different from the alder. ConclusionsThe Japanese respond to alder pollen just same as they do to birch pollen in forming specific IgE antibody. In clinical practice, positive alder RAST has the same meaning as positive birch RAST...|$|R

Egg white protein is {{composed}} of over 30 proteins; many of which have neither been identified nor their <b>allergenicities</b> characterized. This study set out to analyze whether unknown proteins that bind to IgE antibodies in serum from patients with egg allergy exist in egg white. MethodsDiluted egg white proteins were separated by 2 -dimensional (2 -D) gel electrophoresis. Immunolabeling was performed on individual patient sera from 19 child patients with egg white allergy and 11 negative control subjects. Spots of egg white proteins that bound to the patients' IgE were identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. ResultsEgg white proteins were separated into 63 spots. Twenty-five of the 63 reacted with egg allergy patients' sera, and 10 of the 25 reactive spots showed IgE-reactivity to controls as well. Specific bindings to the IgE from egg allergy patients were found in 15 spots; one of which was confirmed as ovotransferrin. Among the other 14 protein spots, egg white cystatin and lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) were newly identified proteins that reacted with IgE in patients with egg allergy. ConclusionsWe demonstrated that L-PGDS and cystatin reacted with serum IgE in patients with egg allergy. Our proteomics-based analysis in egg white gives a comprehensive map of proteins bound with IgE and should assist in enabling more accurate diagnoses and recommendations of desensitizing treatments for individual patients...|$|R

40|$|A pollen {{model that}} simulates {{the timing and}} {{production}} of wind-dispersed allergenic pollen by terrestrial, temperate vegetation has been developed to quantify how pollen occurrence may be affected by climate change and to investigate how pollen can interact with anthropogenic pollutants to affect human health. The Simulator of the Timing and Magnitude of Pollen Season (STaMPS) model is driven by local meteorological conditions and {{is designed to be}} sensitive to climate shifts, as well as flexible with respect to the vegetation species and plant functional types (trees, grasses, etc.) represented and the climate zones simulated. The initial focus for the model is the simulation of the pollen emission potential of important allergenic tree and grass species that typically flower between March–June in Southern California (S. CA), which is characterized by moderate Mediterranean and oceanic climate zones as well as regions of arid desert and arid steppe. Vegetation cover and species composition data are obtained from numerous datasets and a database of allergenic vegetation species, their pollen production potential and relative <b>allergenicities</b> has been developed. For the selected allergenic species and spring-early summer simulation period, temperature is the main driver controlling the timing of pollen release, while precipitation (and temperature, for some species) controls the magnitude of pollen produced. The model provides species-specific pollen potential maps for each day of the simulation period; these are then used by a pollen transport model to simulate ambient pollen concentrations as described in a companion paper (Zhang et al., 2013 a), which also presents model evaluation results for the S. CA model domain. The STaMPS model was also used to quantify the possible impact of climate change on pollen season under the IPCC SRES A 1 B scenario as simulated by the ECHAM 5 global climate model. Current (1995 – 2004) and future (2045 – 2054) meteorological conditions downscaled using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model were used to drive STaMPS and generate estimates of the relative magnitude and timing of pollen season for important allergenic tree and grass species that bloom from March through June in a larger domain that covers all of CA and Nevada. Differences in the simulated timing and magnitude of pollen season for the selected allergenic species under current and future climate scenarios are presented. The results suggest that across all of the simulated species, pollen season starts an average of 5 – 6 days earlier under predicted future climatic conditions with an associated average annual domain-wide temperature increase of about 1 °C compared to simulated current conditions. Differences in the amount of pollen produced under the two scenarios vary by species and are affected by the selected simulation period (1 March– 30 June). Uncertainties associated with the STaMPS model and future model development plans are also discussed...|$|R
