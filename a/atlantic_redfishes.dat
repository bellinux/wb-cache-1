40|$|Morphometric {{characters}} were investigated to provide criteria, {{in addition to}} morphological differences that are presently employed, for species identification of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>redfishes</b> (genus Sebastes). The study involved the analysis of morphometric data for a sample of redfish which was collected in the Labrador-Newfoundland region in 1958 and initially separated into two groups (Sebastes marinus and beaked redfish) {{on the basis of}} color, eye size and beak shape. Standard length was used as a covariate to adjust the morphometric data because S. marinus were on the average largerthan beaked redfishes. Discriminant analyses of (a) 17 morphomet-ric characters resulted in an 11 -variable discriminant function where 65 % of the variability was explained by the groups, (b) the two traditional discriminatiors (length of symphyseal tubercle and width of orbit) resulted in a function where 56 % of the variability was explained by the groups, and (c) the remaining 15 morphometric characters resulted in a 9 -variable function where 58 % of the variability was explained by the groups. The results demonstrated good (87 - 90 %) separation of golden redfish (S. marinus) and beaked redfishes (S. mentella and S. fasciatus). Length of symphyseal tubercle (beak), orbit width, body depth at the position of the pectoral fins, interorbital width, depth of caudal peduncle, and width of pectoral fin base were determined as good morphometric discriminators...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} comparing acoustic and bottom-trawl surveys was conducted on <b>Atlantic</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes spp.) {{on the edge of}} the Green and Grand Banks of Newfoundland, Canada. Redfish were on or near bottom by day and migrated vertically in the water column at night. In an attempt to account for biases attributable to the presence of fish in the near-bottom dead zone (DZ), a correction factor was applied based on density values measured within the first few metres above the detected bottom. Acoustic densities within increasing range increments above the bottom were compared with densities estimated from the trawl catch. Swept area was calculated using both the trawl's wing spread and door spread as proxies for the minimum and maximum fishing widths. Uncorrected acoustic densities were significantly higher during the night than during the day. No significant day/night differences for the entire water column were observed after DZ corrections. Close agreement between acoustic and trawl densities was obtained by integrating within the first 10 to 20 m off the bottom, with or without the DZ corrections, for both day and night experiments, but regression slopes differed. Trawl catchability appeared to be density-dependent at night, being higher at lower fish densities. Daytime acoustic estimates were more variable than those made at night, as indicated by consecutive passes of several transects and CVs of density (means of 131 % during day, 35 % at night). We conclude that acoustic measurements made at night provide the most reliable and least variable density estimates, and make recommendations for surveys...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and utilize electrophoretic methods for the taxonomic {{identification}} of Northeast <b>Atlantic</b> <b>redfish</b> (genus Sebastes). Morphological traits are insufficient for proper identification of these species, particularly for 0 - and 1 -group individuals. Haemoglobins and 17 enzymes in white muscle, heart, eye, and liver have been analysed. In adult specimens only a few of these enzymes are useful for separating between the species, so only 4 enzymes were analysed for the 0 - and 1 -group fish. The enzymes were identified by histochemical staining procedures. 0 - and 1 -group S. viviparus could be identified by diagnostic phenotypes of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) in all tissues, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) in eye and muscle, and malic enzyme (ME) in liver. To identify 0 - and 1 -group specimens of S. mentella, blood samples are needed, as it is only the haemoglobin patterns that are diagnostic for this species. For positive identification of 0 - and 1 -group S. marinus, analysis of both haemoglobins and, e. g. MDH is necessary. However, in all three species, specimens less than 60 mm had not developed the adult haemoglobin pattern, thus making haemoglobin of no value in the classification of smaller 0 -group specimens, and the separation of S. marinus and S. mentella specimens less than 60 mm impossible. The three species showed different fre-quency distributions of IDH (liver) and ME (muscle and liver) phenotypes, thus making it possible to estimate the most likely proportion of individuals from each species when they occur in a mixture...|$|R

We characterized the habitat use and behavior of spawning Atlantic cod at two locations off the coast of southwestern Iceland during a 2 -d research cruise (15 – 16 April 2009). We simultaneously operated two different active hydroacoustic gear types, a split beam echosounder and a dual frequency imaging sonar (DIDSON), as well as a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV).

I conducted two separate investigations describing the use of endogenous and exogenous resources in larval red fish in an attempt to both provide insight into recruitment processes as well as understand the evolutionary success of these species. [...] The first study examined changes in lipid and fatty acid profiles in developing pre-extruded larvae. During development within the female there was nearly a 50 % reduction in total lipid, suggesting that lipids are an important source of energy and that metabolism of these resources occurs prior to parturition. Triacylglycerol was preferentially catabolised over polar lipids unlike other Atlantic groundfish during embryogenesis such as cod (Gadus morhua) and halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus). High variability in these lipid reserves suggests that sensitivity to mismatches in prey after parturition likely varies between broods, assuming increased endogenous resources reduces risk of starvation.

The results were used 1) {{to assess the}} consistency between current management units and units identified by results based on genetic data for each species, and 2) to assess the efficiency of SNP data compared to conventional markers in studying population genomics. Panels of nuclear genomic markers, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites, derived from modern genomic approaches, and data on species life history traits, were analyzed to explore genetic complexity within these highly migratory and continuously distributed species. The investigation reveals biologically distinct populations within each of these species. Four genetic clusters of saithe and two clusters of Greenland halibut {{were found in the}} North <b>Atlantic.</b> For beaked <b>redfish,</b> results using both the genome-wide SNP and microsatellite data supported one group (‘shallow’) throughout the North Atlantic and a second group (‘deep’) in the central North Atlantic and Canadian waters. A localized group (‘slope’) of beaked redfish was identified in Greenland and Icelandic waters. Microsatellite DNA supported three unrecognized cryptic species of golden redfish in Greenland and nearby waters. Genetic isolation in golden and beaked redfish was greater than in saithe and Greenland halibut, which is possibly associated with unique life history features of redfishes. The results indicate a correlation between genetic differentiation and life history differences in the studied species. These findings imply that distinct genetic heterogeneity can exist in different marine species and may be influenced by different biotic and abiotic factors. The results highlight that in most cases the current management units of these species are comprised of multiple biological populations. The new definition of gene pools may serve to define biologically meaningful management units to ensure their sustainable exploitation and preserve evolutionary legacies. This study provides the first SNP-based population genomic investigation in saithe, Greenland halibut and beaked redfish. Comparative analyses of SNP and conventional marker systems demonstrate a higher resolution for SNP markers. Results from genome-wide SNP data identified the three genetic groups of beaked redfish from a much smaller sample set, and the estimated genetic differentiation was much greater than that found by other marker. Both in beaked redfish and Greenland halibut a sub-set of outlier SNPs were identified, implying possible signals of selection in these loci or nearby genomic sites. These outliers may provide increased power in population assignment of the species. The present work illustrates outstanding opportunities of SNP marker system for investigating population genomics of non-model organisms...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of diet is {{fundamental}} to studies of seal ecology and especially to any understanding of their role as predators in the northwest Atlantic marine ecosystem. Hooded seals (Cyostophora cristata) {{are one of the}} largest of the northern phocids and are abundant in the north Atlantic and Arctic seas, but very little quantitative data is available on their feeding behaviour and dietary preferences. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the diet of hooded seals in Newfoundland waters. [...] Otoliths of six common prey species, determined from a previous study on diet of hooded seals, were used to determine fish length / weight - otolith length / height regressions. For all species except Greenland halibut, the strongest correlations between otolith size and fish length / weight were established using maximum otolith length. For Greenland halibut, maximum otolith height gave a better correlation with fish length and weight. Least squares linear equations were used to derive fish length for Arctic cod, Atlantic herring and capelin, while second order polynomial models were used for Greenland halibut, <b>redfish</b> spp., and <b>Atlantic</b> cod. Fish weight estimates were derived using power (log - log) models for all six fish species. [...] Stomach contents of 67 hooded seals collected from inshore and offshore waters off Newfoundland were examined to determine the types of prey eaten by hooded seals. The majority of stomachs (73 %) came from the nearshore region along the northeast coast of Newfoundland and were taken in April. Over half of the samples collected were female (64. 2 %). [...] Fourteen prey groups were identified in stomachs (10 fish, 4 invertebrate). The relative importance of prey, expressed as the percent total wet weight of prey recovered, indicated that Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) was the most important species, followed in order of importance by redfish (Sebastes spp.), Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), squid (Gonatus spp.), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and capelin (Mallotus villosus). [...] Using otoliths from a previous study and from this study, lengths and weights of fish were estimated from a total of 72 stomachs. Hooded seals fed mainly on fish of 25 - 35 cm length for the larger species, and 15 - 25 cm for the smaller ones. Fish consumed by seals caught incidentally from offshore trawlers were larger than those taken elsewhere. The estimated lengths, and proportions (% weight) of fish found per stomach did not differ significantly between male and female hooded seals. [...] The proportions (percent weight) of <b>redfish</b> and <b>Atlantic</b> herring consumed by hooded seals were significantly larger in the summer months, whereas a higher proportion of Arctic cod was consumed in the winter months. No seasonal differences were found in actual lengths of fish eaten. [...] Total energetic values for fish eaten were calculated from estimated wet weights and energy densitites (kJ/g). Greenland halibut, Atlantic herring and Atlantic cod had the highest average energetic values (kJ), followed by redfish, Arctic cod, capelin and squid. Relative contributions of prey, expressed as the percent total energy of prey recovered, showed that Greenland halibut contributed approximately 53 % of the total energy consumed, followed by <b>redfish,</b> <b>Atlantic</b> herring, Arctic cod, squid, Atlantic cod and capelin. These proportions corresponded with those obtained from percent total wet weight of prey recovered. [...] The relative abundance of the fish species has a strong influence on the composition of the food in the diet of seals. Hooded seals spend some time in areas that are exploited by commercial fisheries, and consume commercial fish species of commercial size. However, in order to evaluate the impact of local predation on individual fish stocks, more information on behavioural and physiological characteristics of seals and fish are needed...|$|R
