40|$|Aims: In this study, {{the amount}} of the {{reduction}} in <b>absorption</b> <b>silencer</b> sound filled with Iranian absorbing materials and influence of thickness and density of adsorbent material in silence was investigated. Materials and Methods: We used galvanized channel 0. 6 mm with 30 × 30 cm 2 dimension and axial fan. Length of absorptive silencer was 50 cm, and there used the mineral wool absorbent. Absorptive silencer as channel was designed to cross a section of channel and silencers after embedded the absorber be identical together. This study deals with a number of variables that affect performance of absorptive silencer in the channel and their impact on reducing the sound pressure level be examined. Results: In the frequencies 125 and 250 Hz a reduction of sound pressure level was found. While in frequency 500 Hz minimal reduction is achieved. In this study, an increase in the thickness of the absorbent material of <b>absorption</b> <b>silencer,</b> there was a little change in the volume decreasing but with increasing density from 80 to 100 Kg/m 3 better results were seen to reduce noise levels and it caused to increase NR rate. Conclusion: According to data from the present study we can used silencer with 5 cm thick and 100 Kg/m 3 density in the reduction of sound pressure level at frequencies lower than 250 Hz in the ventilation system as an effective device...|$|E
40|$|The growing noise {{exposure}} of residents, {{due to a}} rising number of flights, causes significant impacts on physical health. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} reduce the noise emission of aircrafts. During take-off, the noise generated by the jet engines is dominating. One way to lower the noise emission of jet engines is to build an <b>absorption</b> <b>silencer</b> by using porous liners. Because of the high thermic and corrosive attacks as well as high fatigue loads, conventional absorbers cannot be used. A promising material is sintered metal fibre felts. This study investigates the suitability of metal fibre felts for the use as absorption material in silencers. The influences of pore morphology, absorption coefficient, determined with perpendicular sound incidence, as well as geometric parameters of the silencer to the damping are identified. To characterise the material, the parameters fibre diameter, porosity and thickness are determined using three-dimensional computer tomography images. The damping potential of absorption silencers is measured using an impedance tube, which was modified for transmission measurements. The essential parameter to describe the acoustic characteristics of porous materials is the flow resistivity. It depends on the size, shape and number of open pores in the material. Finally a connection between pore morphology, flow resistivity of the metal fibre felts and damping potential of the <b>absorption</b> <b>silencer</b> is given...|$|E
40|$|Turbo {{compressors}} {{can generate}} tonal noise in a frequency range of 1000 to 5000 Hz, which may cause nuisance {{in the environment}} where the machine is installed. The cause of this tonal noise is {{the interaction between the}} flow and the rotating blades inside the compressor. The noise is transmitted from the compressor into the pipe system at both suction and discharge sides. Then it is radiated from the pipe walls to the environment. As this noise source can’t be avoided, if necessary a silencer can be installed between the compressor and the pipe system. The silencer blocks the transmission of the noise. The most common type of silencer for this application is the so-called absorption type. However, due to high flow velocities and vibrations, the absorption material may deteriorate and be blown away. A sturdier silencer type has been developed based on rigid acoustic resonators. In this paper the development process is described. This includes one and three dimensional acoustic modeling, scale model tests and the design for a full scale application. Compared to the <b>absorption</b> type <b>silencer,</b> the final silencer design has similar or lower pressure loss and fits in the same containment...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{continuing}} work from the same authors on the same topic of gas pulsation control using a shunt pulsation trap method by Huang (2012 a, 2014). Traditionally, a serial pulsation dampener/muffler, often a reactive type, is connected AFTER the discharge of a positive displacement compressor or engine. It is capable of reducing pressure pulsation level up to 10 - 20 folds or 20 - 40 dB but is bulky and suffers sizable back pressure losses. It has been demonstrated in the previous theoretical and experimental investigations by Huang (2012 a, 2014) that gas pulsations can be as effectively controlled by an alternative method, shunt pulsation trap (SPT) of a parallel configuration, which is more compact and tackles the gas pulsations BEFORE the compressor or engine discharge, hence not suffering any back pressure losses. However, {{it is observed that}} the dampening element inside SPT by a perforated plate (p-plate) induces a severe â€œdrum effectâ€ with enhanced vibration and noise. This paper investigates experimentally the effect of a new dampening element inside the SPT by using circular perforated tubes (p-tubes) with minimum trap volume. It is found that p-tubes can effectively resolve the adverse â€œdrum effectâ€ of p-plate with improved pulsation/vibration/noise reduction. Furthermore, the use of an <b>absorption</b> type <b>silencer</b> is beneficial to further reduce noise level by 10 - 15 dB in addition to the p-tubes under Exhauster and Blower modes. However, this type of silencer will not have the sizable back pressure drop associated with reaction type silencers and therefore will not affect system efficiency. The integration of absorptive silencer into a p-tube based SPT would provide an optimal design choice for size/weight and pulsation/noise reduction, energy saving and for improving equipment fatigue life. The potentials for applying the SPT to screw and scroll compressors are enormous in the future since a significant portion of their operation is under off-design conditions of either an under-compression (UC) or over-compression (OC) ...|$|R
