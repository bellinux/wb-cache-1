40|$|The EU Ecolabel {{criteria}} for all purpose cleaners, sanitary cleaners and window cleaners are under revision. This revision process will {{take into account}} the current market conditions and the EU Ecolabel criteria will aim at addressing the most important environmental impacts of the <b>all-purpose</b> <b>cleaners</b> in a life cycle perspective. The identification of the main hotspots is carried out in this study by means of an initial extensive literature review and subsequent LCA studies. LCA studies showed that sourcing of the raw materials is the most relevant environmental aspect followed by heating up the water during cleaning if needed. Based on the normalisation assessment, by far the most significant impact category for <b>all-purpose</b> <b>cleaners</b> in Europe is natural land transformation. These findings are in agreement with the published literature and can be extrapolated to other <b>all-purpose</b> <b>cleaners</b> such as sanitary cleaners and window cleaners. The study reveals that there are several improvement opportunities such as cleaner concentration which can bring savings in resources or reduction in the wash temperature. Changes in the detergent formulation can also reduce the impacts in different categories. JRC. J. 5 -Sustainable Production and Consumptio...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT—Three studies {{explored}} whether odor can in-fluence people’s cognition {{and behavior}} without their being consciously {{aware of the}} influence. In two studies, we test-ed and confirmed that when participants were unobtru-sively exposed to citrus-scented <b>all-purpose</b> <b>cleaner,</b> the mental accessibility of the behavior concept of cleaning was enhanced, as was indicated by faster identification of cleaning-related words in a lexical decision task and higher frequency of listing cleaning-related activities when describing expected behavior during the day. Finally, a third study established that the mere exposure to the scent of <b>all-purpose</b> <b>cleaner</b> caused participants to keep their direct environment more clean during an eating task. Awareness checks showed that participants were unaware of this influence. The present studies reveal the noncon-scious influence that olfactory cues can have on thinking and doing. Scents influence people’s thinking and doing. We all may have the experience of sniffing at a shirt before deciding to wash it, taking in the odor of food {{to determine whether it}} is still edible, and perhaps suddenly walking faster through a street when a garbage truck passes by. Scents are also expected to modify consumer behavior. For example, aroma diffusers are installed in hotels, shopping malls, and airports. Also, some neutral products are pleasantly scented before they are placed in the stores. Given the potential impact of scents on thinking and doing, it is surprising that the relation between olfaction and action has hitherto received only limited theoretical analysis and empirical attention. Whereas a great deal of research has focused on the physiological features of odor perception (see, e. g., Goldstein, 1999), the influence of scents on cognition and behavior has been largely neglected. Some studies have reported effects of scent on approach-avoidance tendencies. For example, research on consumer behavior suggests that scents increase gambling in casinos (Hirsch, 1995), the time spent on a decision task (Bone & Ellen, 1999; Mitchell, Kahn, & Knasko, 1995), and intentions to visi...|$|E
