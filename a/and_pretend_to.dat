25|$|Barbara shares news of her father's plan to Val; {{to cover}} the Goldmans' {{alternate}} lifestyle, she has told her parents that Armand is straight and cultural attaché to Greece. Armand dislikes the idea of deception, but agrees to play along, hiring contractors to redecorate the family's apartment to more closely resemble a traditional household. Albert initially wants to use his skills as a drag artist to play Val's mother, but Val and Armand fear that the trick will not work, and instead convince him to pose as Val's uncle. Armand contacts Katherine and explains the situation; she agrees to the farce, promising {{to come to the}} party <b>and</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> be his wife. Armand then tries to coach Albert on how to be straight, but Albert's flamboyant nature makes the task difficult.

25|$|After about a month, Yang Zhao {{failed to}} {{overcome}} Lu Kang and {{had run out}} of ideas so he withdrew his army on one night. Lu Kang wanted to pursue the enemy but he was worried that Bu Chan (who was still inside Xiling) might use the opportunity to attack him from behind, and he did not have enough troops with him. He then ordered his men to beat the drums <b>and</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> prepare to attack Yang Zhao's retreating forces. When Yang Zhao's men saw that, they were so terrified that they abandoned their armour and equipment and fled. Lu Kang sent a small group of lightly-armed soldiers to pursue Yang Zhao and they inflicted a crushing defeat on the enemy. Yang Hu and the other Jin generals withdrew their armies after receiving news of Yang Zhao's defeat. Lu Kang then attacked and conquered Xiling. Bu Chan, along with his family and high-ranking officers, were executed for treason, while the others, numbering over 10,000, were pardoned after Lu Kang made a request to the Wu court. Lu Kang then had Xiling's fortifications repaired before returning east to Yue District (樂鄉). He remained humble after his victory in Xiling and still behaved {{in the same manner as}} he did before. His humility earned him the respect and favour of his men.|$|E
25|$|Alex Koslov put his {{recently}} won AAA Cruiserweight Championship {{on the line}} in the third PPV match of the night as he wrestled against Extreme Tiger, Crazy Boy and Alan Stone in a Elimination hardcore match. The match saw the frequent use of both tables and ladders throughout the match, mixed in with steel chairs for good measure. Koslov's reign as the first AAA Cruiserweight champion ended after just over two weeks as he was the first man eliminated from the match, pinned by Alan Stone. With Koslov eliminated it was a guarantee {{that there would be a}} new champion by the end of the match. Alan Stone's inexperience in Hardcore matches caused him to be eliminated secondly, leaving Crazy Boy and Extreme Tiger, both of whom had a great deal of experience with hardcore matches. The final section of the match had several slow sections where one wrestler set up a table, a ladder or an elaborate chair set up while the other wrestler had to lay on the mat <b>and</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> be knocked down. At one point Crazy Boy very obviously pushed himself into position so that Extreme Tiger could execute a leap off the top rope onto him. In the final moments of the match saw Extreme Tiger leap out of the ring and splash Crazy Boy through a table. After taking a moment to recover Extreme Tiger was able to get back in the ring, only seconds before the referee counted Crazy Boy out. With the count out victory Extreme Tiger was declared the new AAA Cruiserweight champion.|$|E

Production of the song was completed by Luke alongside Blanco and Ammo. After being nominated for the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, Kesha elaborated on the song's initial inspiration.

500|$|Rob Maier, {{construction}} {{coordinator and}} production designer for [...] "Tempest" [...] was very busy for this episode, as scenes were filmed at the Andalinis farm, and Zero Avenue (which {{is the name}} of the road that runs along the Canada–US border) for the scene where the three tornadoes touch down beside Lana. He also had to work on shattering the windows at the Luthor Mansion for Lex and Lionel’s final confrontation. The band Remy Zero, whose single [...] "Save Me" [...] is the opening theme for the show, was asked to perform for the episode. The band quickly learned that filming a live performance for a television show is not as straight forward as its sounds. In order to be able to film everything, Beeman could not have the band playing full volume throughout the scene. There were times when everyone had to be quiet <b>and</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> play, or dance, while the actors exchanged their dialogue.

Gloucester fired 18 six- and 14 four-inch shells during the brief engagement, but only hit Breslau once to little effect. She was not hit in return. Kelly was forced to break off his pursuit at 16:40 as Milne had strictly forbidden him to pass Cape Matapan, Greece, and his coal was running low.|$|E

500|$|By {{the early}} 1990s Hordern was concentrating more on television. His roles were mostly those of ageing teachers, bank managers, {{politicians}} and clergymen.

[...] After that he took the part of Godfrey Colston in Memento Mori, a television film about a group of elderly friends succumbing to old age, which was adapted for television from the Muriel Spark novel of the same name. The film received excellent notices [...] and Hordern's performance was described as outstanding by the critic Neil Sinyard. All that was required of Hordern in his next role, the wealthy but terminally ill landowner Peter Featherstone in the BBC adaptation Middlemarch, was for him simply to lie in bed <b>and</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> die. It was the kind of role which he found to be most fitting for someone of his advanced years and confirmed to him that the older he got, the more typecast he became. It was a situation that did not altogether bother him as he felt grateful for being employable at the age of 81.|$|E
