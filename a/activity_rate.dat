25|$|The {{most serious}} {{demographic}} imbalance {{is between the}} mountainous areas of the interior and the coastal strip. The largest province, L'Aquila, is situated entirely in the interior and has the lowest population density. The movement {{of the population of}} Abruzzo from the mountains to the sea has led to the almost complete urbanisation of the entire coastal strip especially in the province of Teramo and Chieti. The effects on the interior have been impoverishment and a demographic ageing, reflected by an <b>activity</b> <b>rate</b> in the province of L'Aquila which is the lowest of the provinces in Abruzzo – accompanied by geological degradation {{as a result of the}} absence of conservation measures. In the coastal strip, on the other hand, there is such a jumble of accommodation and activities that the environment has been changed with negative effects. The policy of providing incentives for development has resulted in the setting-up of industrial zones, some of which (Vasto, Avezzano, Carsoli, Gissi, Val Vibrata, Val di Sangro) have made genuine progress, while others (Val Pescara, L'Aquila) have run into trouble after initial success. The zones of Sulmona and Guardiagrele have turned out to be more or less failures. Outside these zones, the main activities are agriculture and tourism.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Fine-scale {{movement}} patterns in penaeid prawns are rarely observed in situ, but are essential in understanding habitat use, foraging, and anti-predator behaviour. Acoustic telemetry {{was applied to}} examine the activity, space utilization, and habitat use of the eastern king prawn Penaeus (Melicertus) plebejus, at small tem-poral and spatial scales. Tracking of sub-adult P. plebejus (n = 9) in Wallagoot Lake (36. 789 S, 149. 959 E; 23 April– 12 May 2009) and calculation of a minimum activity index (MAI) revealed high variation in <b>activity</b> <b>rates</b> across diel periods and in different habitats. Elevated <b>activity</b> <b>rates</b> and movement indicated foraging in unvegetated habitats during the night. Areas within the 95 and 50 % space uti-lization contours averaged 2, 654. 1 ± 502. 0 and 379. 9 ± 103. 9 m 2, respectively, {{and there was a}} significant negative relationship between these areas and prawn <b>activity</b> <b>rates</b> in unvegetated habitats. This study provides the first estimates of prawn <b>activity</b> <b>rates</b> and space utilization in the field.

40|$|We {{report on}} a {{statistical}} analysis of the lightning <b>activity</b> <b>rates</b> in all Brazilian cities. We {{find out that the}} average of lightning <b>activity</b> <b>rates</b> exhibit a dependence on the latitude of the cities, displaying one peak around the Tropic of Capricorn and another one just before the Equator. We verify that the standard deviation of these rates is almost a constant function of the latitude and that the distribution of the fluctuations surrounding the average tendency is quite well described by a Gumbel distribution, which thus connects these rates to extreme processes. We also investigate the behavior of the lightning <b>activity</b> <b>rates</b> versus the longitude of the cities. For this case, the average rates exhibit an approximate plateau {{for a wide range of}} longitude values, the standard deviation is an approximate constant function of longitude, and the fluctuations are described by a Laplace distribution. We further characterize the spatial correlation of the lightning <b>activity</b> <b>rates</b> between pairs of cities, where our results show that the spatial correlation function decays very slowly with the distance between the cities and that for intermediate distances the correlation exhibits an approximate logarithmic decay. Finally, we propose to model this last behavior within the framework of the Edwards-Wilkinson equation. Comment: Accepted for publication in EP...|$|R

40|$|Larvae of {{the native}} Australian chrysopid Mallada signata use {{discarded}} prey items and environmental debris ('trash'), carried on the dorsal abdominal segments, as camouflage. Larvae that carry trash were confirmed experimentally to experience lower rates of cannibalism, an effect attributed to the camouflage conferred by the package. Larvae preferred physically hard material over normal dietary items when constructing their trash-package. The inclusion of these materials in the package may provide both physical and chemical camouflage from predator and prey alike. When encounter rates between conspecifics were low, larvae that carried trash increased their <b>activity</b> <b>rates</b> as they aged. In contrast, trash-denuded larvae decreased <b>activity</b> <b>rates</b> as they aged. Among first-instar larvae, as the density of larvae increased and encounters became more frequent, those with trash moved further than those without. Larvae with trash packages exhibited lower cannibalism and higher <b>activity</b> <b>rates,</b> which may subsequently enhance foraging capacity...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is to {{estimate}} the size of underground economy in the period 2001 - 2007 using labour approach. Two types of data are used: administrative and survey. The main questions are: How did the <b>activity</b> <b>rates</b> move? What is the relationship between <b>activity</b> <b>rates</b> and the size of shadow economy? Is there correlation between official employment, official unemployment and unofficial employment (shadow economy) and what is it like? What is the position of Croatia considering the members of the European Union? It is presumed that the increase of <b>activity</b> <b>rates</b> causes decrease of underground economy. However, this assumption is valid only for administrative data. Correlation analysis is based on regression models and given results are quite logical. If Croatian and European underground economy is compared, it can be confirmed that the position of Croatia is extremely poor. Given results are approximative and show the level of Croatian underground economy which is presumably underestimated. These phenomena occur because of available statistics and method limitation...|$|R
40|$|Aims: This study {{examined}} the relationship between Olympic years and leisure-time physical activity levels across Canadian provinces and territories, as well as between genders. Methods: Analysis of long-term regional and national data on physical activity patterns confirmed that average <b>activity</b> <b>rates</b> were significantly higher (X 2 (1) = 8. 52, p <. 01) for Winter vs. Summer Olympic Years. Results: Results indicate significant long-term temporal, sex and geographic trends which establish a reoccurring increase in physical activity amongst moderately active Canadian males (leisure-time physical <b>activity</b> <b>rates</b> were somewhat lower amongst females) across all provinces and territories during Winter Olympic years. This suggests that the Olympic Games, particularly the Winter Olympics, may act as a catalyst for increasing Canadian leisure-time physical <b>activity</b> <b>rates</b> - predominately amongst males. Subsequently, this paper recommends that greater media campaigns be directed toward Canadian females in an attempt to increase their leisure-time activity levels. Furthermore, greater emphasis should be placed on providing fitness programs for employees at their workplace - facilitating ease and convenience for increased leisuretime physical activity in general...|$|R

30|$|With limited data on labour mobility, the {{standard}} {{approach in the}} literature is to follow the methodology by Blanchard and Katz (1992). Blanchard and Katz (1992) depart from the observation that changes in relative employment levels across US states persist over time, while relative unemployment and <b>activity</b> <b>rates</b> are stationary variables (i.e. shocks to these variables fade away after some time). The main idea is that if asymmetric shocks have permanent effect on employment but not on unemployment and <b>activity</b> <b>rates,</b> the change in employment levels must be absorbed by changes in the working-age population. Assuming that labour demand shocks do not influence demographic trends, the response of relative population must reflect the response of labour mobility.|$|R
