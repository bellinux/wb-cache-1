The high levels of enantioselectivity achieved with these ligands opened the door for numerous other asymmetric transformations, which previously relied on bidentate phosphine ligands. This paradigm shift using monodentate phosphine ligands challenged the belief that a tight metal-ligand complex is necessary for high stereocontrol. Then in 2000, Reetz, Pringle, [...] and Feringa and de Vries [...] each autonomously described the use of phosphoramidite ligands for <b>assymetric</b> hydrogenation. High enantioselectivities were reached, rivaling those using the most selective bidentate ligands known.

The underpricing phenomenon tends to occur because there are notions of <b>assymetric</b> information and ex-ante uncertainty during initial public offering.

Supervisor's e-mail address: majer@ u. cas. cz Abstract In the presented work we study natural algorthmic problems {{rising from the}} concept of Nash Equilibrium. The problem of it's existence is trivial, because it follows from Nash The- orem of completeness of Nash Equilibria. Even related search problem doesn't seem to belong to NP-complete class, the reason being the very fact, that existence of Nash Equilibria is certain. Interesting observation is that every natural extension of this problem seems to be NP-complete. Many of such problems have been proven to be NP-complete through reduction of SAT problem, Klike problem or problem of searching subcover of certain size. The question, wheather the pro- blem of existence of assymmetric Nash equilibria of symmeric game ts with the others, in being NP-complete, has been an open problem. Here we show how to alternate the proof from [?] and apply the construction to problem of existence of <b>assymetric</b> equilibria and therefore prove its NP-completness.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} sharing {{the cost of a}} network that meets the connection demands of a set of agents. The agents simultaneously choose paths in the network connecting their demand nodes. A mechanism splits the total cost of the network formed among the participants. We introduce two new properties of implementation. The first prop- erty, Pareto Nash Implementation (PNI), requires that the efficient out- come is always implemented in a Nash equilibrium, and that the efficient outcome Pareto dominates any other Nash equilibrium. The average cost mechanism (AC) and other <b>assymetric</b> variations, are the only rules that meet PNI. These mechanisms are also characterized under Strong Nash Implementation. The second property, Weakly Pareto Nash Implementation (WPNI), requires that the least inefficient equilibrium Pareto dominate any other equilibrium. The egalitarian mechanism (EG), a variation of AC that meets individual rationality, and other <b>assymetric</b> mechanisms are the only rules that meet WPNI and Individual Rationality. PNI and WPNI provide the first economic justification of the Price of Stability (PoS), a seemingly natural measure in the computer science literature but not easily embraced in economics.
