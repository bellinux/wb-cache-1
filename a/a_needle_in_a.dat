Chand, who acted pro bono for Hodgson, said of his investigation: [...] "The search was the most difficult thing I have encountered in my personal and professional life. It was like finding <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> haystack. I spent months chasing false leads and implacable bureaucracy but I was not prepared to accept this, as instinct told me that the samples would be somewhere. I persevered because I had a gut feeling that something was wrong." [...] Eventually, Chand's probing led to the rediscovery of an archive of evidence on an industrial estate in the Midlands [...] "which they appeared to have forgotten about". Stored here were all of the swabs taken by the pathologist in December 1979. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) notified Julian Young of the initial results of the DNA analysis, and on 30January 2009 it was confirmed that the semen detected on the vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from Hodgson.|$|E

For <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> Ising strip the interaction on mesoscopic scales depends on {{the width of the}} strip and the length, position, and orientation of the needle. By lattice Monte Carlo simulations we evaluate the free energy difference between needle configurations being parallel and perpendicular to the strip. We concentrate on small but nonetheless mesoscopic needle lengths for which analytic predictions are available for comparison. All combinations of boundary conditions for the needles and boundaries are considered which belong to either the "normal" or the "ordinary" surface universality class, i. e., which induce local order or disorder, respectively. We also derive exact results for needles of arbitrary mesoscopic length, <b>in</b> particular for <b>needles</b> embedded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> half plane and oriented perpendicular to the corresponding boundary as well as for needles embedded at the center line of a symmetric strip with parallel orientation.

40|$|A {{method and}} an {{apparatus}} for three-dimensional ultrasound imaging of a needle-like instrument, such as <b>a</b> biopsy <b>needle,</b> inserted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> human body. The instrument is visualized by transmitting ultrasound beams toward {{the instrument and}} then detecting the echo signals using a linear array of transducer elements. The problem of ultrasound being reflected from <b>a</b> biopsy <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> direction away from the transducer array is solved by steering the transmitted ultrasound beams t increase the angle at which the beams impinge upon the biopsy needle. Ideally the ultrasound beams are perpendicular to the needle. This increases the system 2 ̆ 7 s sensitivity to the needle because the reflections from the needle are directed close to the transducer array. This can be accomplished using either the B mode or the color flow mode of an ultrasound imaging system. The acquired data for multiple two-dimensional image frames is gathered in memory to form a data volume, which is then processed to form a three-dimensional image (by projection) or a two-dimensional slice taken at an angle through the data volume. <b>In</b> particular, <b>a</b> two-dimensional slice which is coplanar with inserted biopsy needle can be imaged...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{contribute}} to a semi-autonomous active sensing system for needle tracking during percutaneous needle insertion. The objective is twofold: first to develop a system for acquiring ultrasound images, then to analyze these images in order to track the needle. The thesis is thus divided into two main lines of research: (1) investigate whether it is feasible to make a robotic system for acquiring ultrasound images using commercially available components; (2) investigate how to track <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> using 2 D ultrasound images and possibly other sensor information in real-time. In this thesis we have developed an ultrasound robotic system using the UR 5 robot from Universal Robots, based on a set of requirements derived from {{the state of the art}} in the literature. The system has both force and haptic control. We developed and tested several novel methods for tracking <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ultrasound image. <b>In</b> addition, <b>a</b> novel visual servoing method has been developed to ensure that the <b>needle</b> lies <b>in</b> the imaging plane of the ultrasound probe during insertions. The thesis concludes that it is feasible to make an ultrasound robotic system using commercially available components and shows that such a system meets the derived requirements. It also concludes that the novel needle tracking methods presented are both accurate and precise compared to previous methods presented in the literature. It is also shown that using velocity measurements from <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> insertion robot significantly improves the both the accuracy and precision, compared to only using ultrasound images. The visual servoing method shows promise for solving the alignment problem of keeping the <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> the imaging plane of the ultrasound probe...|$|R
