40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{increasing}} use of high-pressure water jets in {{the industry}} for machining materials yields numerous studies aiming at the optimization of this technology. Since the experimental study of pure or abra-sive water jet cutting is complex to carry out, the numerical simulation of this process stands as an attractive alternative. Such a simulation relies on the coupling of numerical tools devoted on one hand to {{the description of the}} high-velocity jet {{and on the other hand}} to the deformation of the impacted material. The present paper provides a careful validation for the simulation of an impinging <b>abrasive</b> <b>liquid</b> jet, taking progressively into account the necessary features: impingement, free-surface, particles...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{finishing}} {{and polishing}} phases {{are essential to}} improve smoothness and shining {{on the surface of}} acrylic resins used to make removable orthodontic appliances. A good surface finishing reduces roughness, which facilitates hygiene, prevents staining and provides greater comfort to the patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to analyze the changes on surface morphology of acrylic resins during finishing and polishing phases. METHODS: Thirty discs (10 mm in diameter and 5 mm in length) were made with acrylic resin and randomly divided into ten groups. The control group did not receive any treatment while the other groups received gradual finishing and polishing. The last group received the entire finishing and polishing procedures. Surface morphology was qualitatively analyzed through scanning electron microscopy and quantitatively analyzed through a laser profilometer test. RESULTS: The acrylic resin surfaces without treatment showed bubbles which were not observed in the subsequent phases. Wearing out with multilaminated burs, finishing with wood sandpaper and finishing with water sandpaper resulted in surfaces with decreasing irregularities. The surfaces that were polished with pumice and with low <b>abrasive</b> <b>liquids</b> showed high superficial smoothness. CONCLUSION: Highly smooth acrylic resin surfaces can be obtained after mechanical finishing and polishing performed with multilaminated burs, wood sandpaper, water sandpaper, pumice and low <b>abrasive</b> <b>liquids...</b>|$|R

The machining is simulated by Finite Element Method (FEM) in the paper. Hydrodynamic {{pressure on}} modeling of wedge-like grinding zone between wheel and workpiece on abrasive jet finishing with wheel as restraint was established and simulation, based on Navier-Stokes and continuity equations.

40|$|AbstractAdditive {{manufacturing}} (AM) {{offers the}} possibility of creating a complex free form object as a single element, which is not possible using traditional mechanical machining. Unfortunately the typically rough surface finish of additively manufactured parts is unsuitable for many applications. As a result AM parts must be post-processed; typically mechanically machined and/or and polished using either chemical or mechanical techniques (both of which have their limitations). Laser based polishing is based on remelting of a very thin surface layer and it offers potential as a highly repeatable, higher speed process capable of selective area polishing, and without any waste problems (no <b>abrasives</b> or <b>liquids).</b> In this paper an in-depth investigation of CW laser polishing of titanium and cobalt chrome AM elements is presented. The impact of different scanning strategies, laser parameters and initial surface condition on the achieved surface finish is evaluated...|$|R
50|$|While cutting {{with water}} is {{possible}} for soft materials, the addition of an abrasive turned the waterjet into a modern machining tool for all materials. This began in 1935 when the idea of adding an abrasive to the water stream was developed by Elmo Smith for the <b>liquid</b> <b>abrasive</b> blasting. Smith’s design was further refined by Leslie Tirrell of the Hydroblast Corporation in 1937, resulting in a nozzle design that created a mix of high-pressure water and abrasive {{for the purpose of}} wet blasting.|$|R

Of note is that tension created {{by the force of}} the recoiler pulling the strip through the scale breaker/leveler serves to flatten the strip, removing bow, edge wave and minor coil breaks. Also, not shown in Figure 2 is the slurry delivery/recirculation/filtering system.

40|$|A {{colloidal}} AFM-based {{method was}} used to understand the role of diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride (DADMAC) molecules in non-Prestonian silicon dioxide removal obtained using ceria-based slurries. A series of force-distance measurements between silicon dioxide films, polyurethane IC 1000 polishing pad and ceria <b>abrasives</b> in <b>liquid</b> media with and without DADMAC molecules were made. It was shown that at 15 mM concentration, DADMAC molecules yield non-Prestonian behavior by interfering between ceria particles and the oxide film. The effects of the DADMAC additive on the removal rates of the oxide films and their corresponding coefficients of friction (COFs) values were also investigated. Finally, the correlation between AFM force measurements, removal rates and COF values measured during polishing are discussed. Interestingly, below a threshold COF value of ∼ 0. 23 to 0. 24, corresponding to a threshold down pressure of ∼ 2 psi for both 15 mM and 25 mM DADMAC concentration, no oxide film removal was observed. © The Author(s) 2015.

40|$|AbstractLaser {{polishing}} is {{a process}} by which the surface roughness of machined parts can be reduced avoiding ablation phenomena. In this process the laser spot irradiates the sample surface with short laser pulses at a power density that causes a surface melting of the order of few nanometers. Compared to conventional polishing process (as grinding) it ensures the possibility of avoiding any surface orientation, no tool wear, no <b>abrasive</b> or <b>liquids,</b> no debris and less machining time; moreover coupled with a galvo system it results to be more suitable in case of 3 D complex workpieces. Nowadays, on this process, several authors are focusing their attention on the wavelength and pulse length effect but a lack of knowledge concerning the effect of other process parameters still exists. In this work the effects of laser path and assist gas were tested by the authors. Nd:YVO 4 laser source, characterized by a wavelength equal to 532 nm, was used in the experiments and Ti grade 2 samples were selected.

Consequently, equipment owners are quite often forced to invest substantially in system maintenance to avoid unscheduled downtime. In this study, an approach combining relevance vector machines (RVMs) with a sum of two exponential functions was developed to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of field pump impellers.

40|$|WC/Co {{coatings}} {{are widely}} applied to {{different types of}} components due to their extraordinary performance properties including high hardness and wear properties. In industrial applications High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) technique is extensively used to deposit hard metal coatings. The main advantage of HVOF compared to other thermal spray techniques {{is the ability to}} accelerate the melted powder particles of the feedstock material at a relatively high velocity, leading to obtain good adhesion and low porosity level. However, despite the mentioned benefits, the surface finish quality of WC-Co HVOF coatings results to be poor (Ra higher than 5 μm) thus a mechanical polishing process is often needed. The main problem is that the high hardness of coating leads the polishing process expensive in terms of time and tool wear; moreover polishing becomes difficult and not always possible in case of limited accessibility of a part, micro dimensions or undercuts. Nowadays a different technique available to improve surface roughness is the laser polishing process. The polishing principle is based on focused radiation of a laser beam that melts a microscopic layer of surface material. Compared to conventional polishing process (as grinding) it ensures the possibility of avoiding tool wear, less pollution (no <b>abrasive</b> or <b>liquids),</b> no debris, less machining time and coupled with a galvo system it results to be more suitable in case of 3 D complex workpieces.

40|$|Past {{decontamination}} and {{solvent recovery}} {{activities at the}} Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) {{have resulted in the}} accumulation of 1. 5 million gallons of radioactively contaminated sodium-bearing liquid waste. Future decontamination activities at the ICPP could result in the production of 5 million gallons or more of sodium-bearing waste using the current decontamination techniques of chemical/water flushes and steam jet cleaning. With the curtailment of reprocessing at the ICPP, the focus of decontamination is shifting from maintenance for continued operation of the facilities to decommissioning. As decommissioning plans are developed, new decontamination methods must be used which result in higher decontamination factors and generate lower amounts of sodium-bearing secondary waste. The primary initiative of the WINCO Decontamination Development Program is the development of methods to eliminate/minimize the use of sodium-bearing decontamination chemicals. One method that was chosen for cold scoping studies during FY- 93 was abrasive grit blasting.
