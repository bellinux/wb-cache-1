The government was forced to sell sterling for US dollars to then buy Hong Kong dollar to support the rate.

In August 1973, Governor Murray MacLehose and Haddon-Cave attempted to end the historic commitment to sterling reserves but the idea was rejected by London. The British government offered a unilateral agreement in return to guarantee sterling balances at a new slightly higher rate. In July 1974 the price of US$1 fell below HK$5.05 which force Haddon-Cave to announce the Hong Kong dollar to float free from its link to the US dollar on 27 November.

40|$|Abstract — Under the {{enhanced}} single buyer model of electricity supply industry in Thailand, tariff regulation {{is needed to}} prevent unfair pricing for consumers. Retail electricity tariff, being separated into base tariff and <b>automatic</b> tariff <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism,</b> has been regulated by multiple regulatory bodies. Findings reveal that Thai electricity base tariff regulations tended to favor electric utilities rather than consumers, basing on rate of return regulatory approach. In addition, the <b>automatic</b> tariff <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> attached greater importance to operators than to the consumers, enabling the former to fully pass the fuel and power purchase burdens through to the consumers. The results of adoption of current regulatory regime are excess capacity in electricity supply industry and excessive profits for electric utilities.

40|$|The article aims at {{analysing}} {{the current}} situation in the Euro area {{with respect to the}} balance of payments <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> that should normally be at place. Internally, the Euro area membership represents a combination of the fixed exchange rate, capital mobility and no monetary policy autonomy; externally, the Euro area countries apply floating exchange rates with high capital mobility, and autonomous monetary policy. Member states thus cannot use the monetary instruments to prevent external influences; they can only use fiscal policies, which are limited by the Stability and Growth Pact and debt constraint. When external imbalance occurs (such as today), the economies of member states are exposed to the price and income adjustment processes as well as to their own fiscal and ECB policy impacts. This article shows that all these factors interfere and influence real effects of <b>automatic</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which in some cases cannot come forth at all.

40|$|The steep drop in {{financial}} markets in 2008 {{coupled with the}} ongoing economic recession pose immediate challenges for some public pension systems, particularly those that rely partly on equity investments. In the case of Sweden, the crisis provides an initial ‘stress test’ for a major pension system reform implemented earlier this decade. The new system created by the reform {{was designed to be}} fiscally sustainable by including <b>automatic</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to maintain balance in response to short-term economic and financial fluctuations and long-term demographic changes. Last fall’s plummeting stock market produced a decline in Sweden’s pension reserve funds and triggered a first-time automatic reduction in the pension indexation scheduled to occur in 2010. In response, policymakers decided to spread out the required adjustment over a longer period. This brief is organized as follows. The first section describes how the Swedish pension system is designed to maintain fiscal stability. The second section documents trends in the system’s financial status. The third section explores the potential impact of the economic crisis on pension benefits under the system’s original rules. The fourth section describes the policy response. The final section concludes that even <b>automatic</b> <b>adjustments</b> may produce offsetting political considerations. ...|$|R

40|$|Ever since David Hume {{introduced}} his price-specie flow mechanism in 1752, {{the question of}} external adjustment has been a classic issue for international macroeconomists. In 1968 Robert Mundell asked “To what extent should surplus countries expand; to what extent should deficit countries contract? ” (Mundell, 1968). The debate {{in those days was}} about the relative merits of expenditure-switching and expenditure-reducing policies, analyzed within the useful template of the Mundell-Fleming model. Subsequent research introduced microfoundations, added an explicit dynamic dimension borrowed from optimal growth theory, and highlighted the role of expectations. Throughout this process, understanding the adjustment of a country’s external balances remained a key issue. By the early 1980 s a modern synthesis had emerged, {{in the form of the}} intertemporal approach to the current account. It characterized the dynamics of external debt as the result of forward-looking decisions by households and investment decisions by firms, set in market structures of varying degrees of complexity. As Obstfeld remarks: [This approach] provides a conceptual framework appropriate for thinking about the important and interrelated policy issues of external balance, external sustainability, and equilibrium real exchange rates … [and shifts] attention from <b>automatic</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and dynamic stability considerations to intertemporal budget constraints and transversality conditions for maximizatio...|$|R

40|$|The {{last two}} decades have been characterised by {{significant}} changes in national pension arrangements. While at first, a consensus seemed to be evolving around a one-size-fits-all reform, more recently the trend has been towards a better customisation of reforms. This paper reviews this process, focusing on five pension policy design issues. These are how policymakers have sought to optimise poverty alleviation effectiveness; the redefinition of the state’s role in smoothing incomes over the life-course; the balancing of contributions to benefits; adjusting the system to be more responsive to demographic, economic and social changes; and ensuring that reforms will be long-lasting. While the role of state pensions still {{appears to be on}} a diminishing path, there has been a growing realisation of the need to ensure that they remain adequate. This has led to the setting up of innovative minimum pension schemes and credits for periods of childcare and unemployment. The expanding role of private pensions has also led governments to intervene more in their operation. Policymakers have shown strong interest in <b>automatic</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> to try to bring about required economic changes. However there is greater understanding that for the latter to happen, the state has to engage more with its citizens. While changes in pension systems can help societies respond to the ageing transition, for instance by removing incentives to retire too early or by aligning better the generosity of benefits to contributions made, there will need to be a much broader policy response. ...|$|R

40|$|The public pension {{world has}} seen two {{innovations}} in recent years. One is {{the emergence of}} notional defined contribution (NDC) plans. The other is the introduction of automatic adjustment mechanisms to help keep pension systems solvent when the economy weakens. This brief looks at the Swedish system to demonstrate how NDCs work and evaluates the work­ings of the <b>automatic</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{in the wake of the}} 2008 financial crisis. Sweden passed reform legislation in 1994 that in­troduced a partially-funded NDC plan. 1 The arrange­ment is conceptually similar to a defined contribution plan in that contributions are accumulated in indi­vidual accounts, but different in that the accounts are not fully funded and may be financed entirely on a pay-as-you-go basis. In this setting, the rate of return credited on the account assets is based on a rule rath­er than on actual returns. The Swedish system uses a notional interest rate equal to the rate of growth of average earnings. However, if a calculation suggests a potential deficit, the notional interest rate is auto­matically reduced through a “brake” mechanism. The recent financial crisis has highlighted ways in which the brake mechanism could be improved. This brief proceeds as follows. The first section describes Sweden’s NDC plan. The second describes the Swedish brake mechanism. The third describes two problems with the current adjustment procedure: 1) it creates the likelihood of large shocks for retir­ees; and 2) while disadvantaging retirees, it tends to advantage workers. The fourth section presents pos­sible fixes for the current problems. The final section concludes that the Swedish NDC plan could function more effectively with modest changes to the brake mechanism. ...|$|E

40|$|Ongoing {{changes in}} the {{delivery}} of electricity services and the the use and management of electricity distribution systems - including the proliferation of distributed energy resources, smart grid technologies (i. e., advanced power electronics and information and communication technologies) and active system management techniques - present new challenges for the economic regulation of electricity distribution utilities. In particular, regulators are likely to face increased uncertainty regarding the evolution of network uses and the efficient cost of network investments and maintenance, as well as an increased informational disadvantage vis-à-vis the regulated utility. These challenges are important for both cost of service (or rate of return) regulation and incentive regulation approaches (also known as revenue or price cap regulation, RPI-X, performance-based regulation, or output-based regulation). This paper proposes a novel process for establishing the allowed revenues of an electricity distribution utility and demonstrates its application as a practical solution to the imminent regulatory challenges discussed above. The proposed method is a new combination of three established regulatory tools: an engineering-based reference network model (RNM) for forward-looking benchmarking of efficient network expenditures; an incentive compatible menu of contracts to elicit accurate forecasts from the utility and establish profit-sharing incentives for cost saving efficiency efforts; and ex post <b>automatic</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> or "delta factors," to accommodate uncertainty in the evolution of network use and minimize forecast error.

A test example shows that, by comparing to the fixed step-size method and the local-error method, our method decreases the computational time by about 10 and 70 times, respectively. The performance of the proposed method is validated and compared to commonly used step-size selection methods by simulating {{the evolution of a}} third-order soliton, the collision of a fundamental soliton pair, and the supercontinuum generation. Numerical simulations show that the proposed method can increase the computational efficiency by more than one and two orders of magnitude in comparison with the symmetrized split-step Fourier method. In addition, the computational efficiency is improved with the increase of the accuracy of solutions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In {{developed}} countries, pensions systems {{emerged as}} a political response to socioeconomic changes brought about by industrialization and urbanization in the late 19 th and early 20 th centruries. Today, new socioeconomic changes create both rationales and political forces for revisions of existing pensions systems. Changes in demography, real wage growth and real interest rates {{are perhaps the most}} obvious examples. Increased instability of the family, more heterogeneity among individuals, greater internationel mobility of labor and capital, and amibitions to ecourage individual responsibility also have important implications for pensions systems. When discussing these issues, it is useful to set up a more elaborate classification of pension systems than the usual distinction between defined-benefit (DB) and defined-contribution (DV) systems. The choice of an appropriate taxonomy depends, of course, on the issues to be raised. One question that is focused on in this paper concerns the consequences of socioeconomic shocks on the distribution of income and the sharing of income risk among generations. {{it turns out that the}} distinction between pensions systems with exogenous and endogenous contribution rates (tax rates) then becomes crucial. Bu the paper also deals with socioeconomic changes that are induced by the pension system itself via behavioral adjustments of individuals - and the feedback of these changes on the pension system. When dealing with such adjustments, highly relevant features of pension systems are the degree to which they are actuarial and funded, respectively - two aspects that are related but not the identical. Six generic pension systems are classified in Section I, highlighting the distinctions mentioned above. The contribution rate is exogenous in two of these systems, while it is endogenous in the other four systems. Each of the six pension systems can ba varied considerably, both by incorporating elements from other systems and by introducing restricitions on contributions or benefits. Section II turns to the consequences of socioeconomic changes for the distribution of income and macroeconomic balance, while sections III and IV examine alternative pension reforms aimed at mitigating some of these consequences. A few of these reforms are "marginal" in the sense that certain rules of a pension system are modified, including both ad hoc policy measures and the introduction of various <b>automatic</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Other reforms are "radical" since they imply shift to different types of pensions sytems. Section V concludes. As always when designing social insurance systems, it is necessary to strika balance between conflicting considerations, such as distribution, risk sharing and incentives. But it is also important to be concerned with the balance between paternalism and individual freedom of choice (and hence individual responsibility). This also raises the more general question of the appropriate role of government in society as a whole, including the control of capital markets and government intervention in the management of firms...|$|R
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{implications}} of fuel <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for the economic efficiency of the U. S., focusing on fuel adjustment clauses (FAC) for electricity rates. Fuel <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> used in electricity and natural gas pricing are formulae that provide for <b>automatic</b> <b>adjustments</b> in output prices in response {{to changes in the}} factor prices of boiler fuels and wellhead gas, respectively. Fuel <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were first utilized in the U. S. during World War I to enable the regulatory process to function in response to the rapid increase in coal prices. A central feature of an FAC is that it acts directly on the output price without a specific consideration of its effect on the rate of return earned by the firm once the adjustment has been made. One of the principal arguments against fuel adjustment clauses is that they dampen incentives for the choice of the least-cost fuel supply. Fuel <b>adjustment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can lead to inefficiency both with respect to the choice by utility of a technology and its selection of fuel supply sources. The fuel supply decision poses an efficiency problem primarily in conjunction with decreasing returns to scale, since a firm with non-decreasing returns to scale and an output price at least as great as marginal cost will choose the fuel supply source that is anticipated to have the smallest factor price increase. When there is an incentive to purchase the inefficient fuel, the collection lag can be extended to induce efficiency. This extension, however, affects the choice of technology by reducing both the technically efficient fuel-capital ratio and the ratio preferred by the firm. Fuel adjustment clauses thus pose a complex efficiency problem, which can be compensated for but not eliminated by the design of the adjustment formula. status: publishe...|$|R
