5|$|Pall-mall, <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> <b>game</b> {{similar to}} croquet, was {{introduced}} to England in the early-17th century by James I. The game, already popular in France and Scotland, was enjoyed by James' sons Henry and Charles. In 1630, St James's Field, London's first pall-mall court, was laid out {{to the north of}} the Haymarket – St James road.|$|E
5|$|Depending on when Salmon graduated, {{it would}} seem that cricket was a normal {{activity}} at Oxford for some time before Phillips wrote his pamphlet. It was certainly well established at Oxford by October 1728 when the 19-year-old Samuel Johnson entered Pembroke College. He told James Boswell that cricket matches were played during the one year he was at Oxford and this was recorded by Boswell in his Life of Samuel Johnson. A comment by Horace Walpole confirms that cricket was being played at Eton during {{the first quarter of the}} 18th century. The earliest reference to cricket being played at Cambridge University is dated 1710 and both of those establishments were attended by William Goldwin who, in 1706, wrote a Latin poem of 95 lines on a rural cricket match. It was called In Certamen Pilae (On <b>a</b> <b>Ball</b> <b>Game)</b> and it was published in his Musae Juveniles.|$|E

25|$|Lacrosse has {{its origins}} in a tribal game played by eastern Woodlands Native Americans and by some Plains Indians tribes {{in what is now}} Canada. The game was {{extensively}} modified by European immigrants to North America to create its current collegiate and professional form. There were hundreds of native men playing <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> <b>game</b> with sticks.The game began with the ball being tossed into the air and the two sides rushing to catch it. Because of the large number of players involved, these games generally tended to involve a huge mob of players swarming the ball and slowly moving across the field. Passing the ball was thought of as a trick, and it was seen as cowardly to dodge an opponent.|$|E
25|$|The Middle Ages saw {{a rise in}} {{popularity}} of games played annually at Shrovetide throughout Europe, particularly in England. The games played in England at this time may have arrived with the Roman occupation {{but there is little}} evidence to indicate this. Certainly the Romans played ball games, in particular Harpastum. There is also one reference to ball games being played in southern Britain prior to the Norman Conquest. In the ninth century Nennius's Historia Britonum tells that a group of boys were playing at ball (pilae ludus). The origin of this account is either Southern England or Wales. References to <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> <b>game</b> played in northern France known as La Soule or Choule, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks, date from the 12th century.|$|E

25|$|Carved Stone Balls {{found at}} various sites in Scotland, {{northern}} England and north eastern Ireland. Spirals and rings of concentric circles carved {{on the balls}} {{can be found on}} standing stones and megalithic structures of the same period. Sites such as Maughanby Circle and Newgrange were designed to monitor the movements of the sun with special emphasis on the winter solstice. The connection with megalithic art infers these carved stone balls had significant cultural importance to the pre-Celtic people who made them. They thought in a symbolic way and displayed ceremonial behaviour we may look upon today as religious. No written records exist for the Neolithic people of Britain and Ireland. From reading the archaeology it has not been possible to determine whether these peoples understood the concept of <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> <b>game.</b> However, as playing ball games feature in later religious festivities including Christmastide which coincides with Yuletide, the winter solstice and the Pagan rebirth of the sun the possibility cannot be ruled out.|$|E

Pisarcik never gained control of the ball after the snap however, and gave a wobbly handoff to Csonka. [...] "I never had control of the ball" [...] Pisarcik later recalled. It rolled off Csonka's hip and bounced free. Eagles safety Herman Edwards picked up the loose ball and ran, untouched, for a score, giving the Eagles an improbable 19–17 victory.
