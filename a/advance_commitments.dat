Locke had indeed given several <b>advance</b> <b>commitments</b> to appear at tournaments and exhibitions, then had not turned up nor given adequate notice nor explanations for his absences. However, it is most likely he was banned because of growing resentment towards him {{from many of the}} other PGA players. The 1948 Masters champion Claude Harmon stated, unsolicited, to another golf personality during that era: [...] "Locke was simply too good. They had to ban him." [...] The ban was lifted in 1951, but Locke chose not to return to play in the United States, except for a few isolated appearances.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{relative}} efficiency of intermediated finance and direct finance in {{a variant of}} Diamond's (1984) model of ''financial intermediation as delegated monitoring''. Project sizes are taken to be variable so a choice must be taken on whether to fund {{a small number of}} projects on large scale or a large number of projects on a small scale. In the absence of effective <b>advance</b> <b>commitments</b> to lending policies, this introduces an additional agency problem of intermediated finance as the well known excessive-risk-taking effect of debt finance induce intermediaries to underdiversify. The paper analyses the impact of this effect on the performance of intermediated finance under various assumptions about project technologies. Most strikingly, in the case of fixed monitoring costs and project technologies with stochastic constant returns to scale, there is no diversification at all, and intermediated finance is worse than direct finance. In this very case, with effective <b>advance</b> <b>commitments</b> to lending policies, an optimal intermediation arrangement would exploit both, the scope for diversification and the scale effects in monitoring so as to attain approximately first-best outcomes when there are many available projects...|$|E

For the latter case, the stationary distribution of the storage level corresponding to the optimal policy is obtained, from which the economic value of the storage as the relative increase in the expected revenue due to the existence of storage is obtained...|$|E

40|$|In theory, food {{handling}} in collaborative housing systems {{could have a}} number of environmental advantages compared with households and food service institutions. This paper explores to what extent some of these theoretical advantages are realised in two collaborative housing units in a major Swedish city. Food-related energy use and waste flows were measured and compared with results from food service institutions and some data relevant for households. Results show that energy use for cooking decreases in collaborative houses compared with households but energy use for food storage increases. Plate and food preparation wastes are low in the studied collaborative houses but food leftovers may be abundant. The latter result depends on how the dining system is organised. A bottleneck for improving the environmental efficiency in collaborative housing is the static view of apartment design held by many architects and real estate owners. Another bottleneck may be the unwillingness of households to make <b>advance</b> <b>commitments</b> to daily dining. collaborative housing; cooking; {{food handling}}; kitchen use; leftovers; resource management; environmental efficiency; Sweden; energy use; waste flows; food service institutions; households; co-housing; food preparation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{confluence}} of population, economic development, and environmental pressures resulting from increased globalization and industrialization reveal an increasingly resource-constrained {{world in which}} predictions point {{to the need to}} do more with less and in a “better” way. The concept of sustainable diets presents an opportunity to successfully <b>advance</b> <b>commitments</b> to sustainable development and the elimination of poverty, food and nutrition insecurity, and poor health outcomes. This study examines the determinants of sustainable diets, offers a descriptive analysis of these areas, and presents a causal model and framework from which to build. The major determinants of sustainable diets fall into 5 categories: 1) agriculture, 2) health, 3) sociocultural, 4) environmental, and 5) socioeconomic. When factors or processes are changed in 1 determinant category, such changes affect other determinant categories and, in turn, the level of “sustainability” of a diet. The complex web of determinants of sustainable diets makes it challenging for policymakers to understand the benefits and considerations for promoting, processing, and consuming such diets. To advance this work, better measurements and indicators must be developed {{to assess the impact of}} the various determinants on the sustainability of a diet and the tradeoffs associated with any recommendations aimed at increasing the sustainability of our food system.

40|$|When {{offered a}} choice (Choice Y) between a small {{immediate}} reward (2 -sec exposure to grain) {{and a large}} reward (4 -sec exposure to grain) delayed by 4 sec, pigeons invariably preferred the small, immediate reward. However, when offered a choice (Choice X) between a delay of T seconds followed by Choice Y and a delay of T seconds followed by restriction to the large delayed reward only, the pigeon's choice depended on T. When T was small, the pigeons chose the alternative leading to Choice Y (and then chose the small, immediate reward). When T was large, the pigeons chose the alternative leading to the large delayed reward only. The reversal of preference as T increases is predicted by several recent models for choice between various amounts and delays of reward.

40|$|This paper models {{sequential}} auctioning of two perfect substitutes by {{a strategic}} seller, who learns about demand from the first-auction price. The seller holds the second auction {{only when the}} remaining demand {{is strong enough to}} cover her opportunity cost. Bidding in anticipation of such a contingent future auction is characterized, including a sufficient condition for existence of an invertible (increasing symmetric pure-strategy) bidding equilibrium that facilitates the seller’s learning. A unique invertible bidding equilibrium exists for the Dutch auction format, but only when the second auction is sufficiently discounted by the bidders. In the equilibrium, high-valuation bidders shade their bids down as if the second auction were guaranteed. To counter such strategic bidding, the seller would value ex-ante commitment to hold the second auction less often. Three forms of such commitment are analyzed: commitment to list future auctions in <b>advance,</b> <b>commitment</b> to not hold the second auction unless the first price exceeds a publicly announced threshold, and commitment to a reserve-price in the second auction...|$|R

40|$|In {{a supply}} chain, {{investments}} that a rm makes in reducing its own variable costs provide an obvious benet to its suppliers: All else being equal, lower marginal costs cause the rm {{to increase its}} own output, hence increasing consumption of suppliers' outputs. Without pre-commitment to wholesale prices from its supplier(s), a rm will tend to underinvest in cost reduction because of fear of being held-up. Clearly, a supplier to such a rm can eliminate this hold-up problem by pre-committing, instead of remaining exible with respect to wholesale price. However, by making an <b>advance</b> <b>commitment</b> to wholesale price, it gives up an important means of responding to demand uncertainty. In this paper we examine the trade-o that is faced by a rm when its downstream channel partner has opportunities to invest in making relationship specic marginal cost reductions. Should it commit to a price {{in order to encourage}} downstream investment in cost reduction, or should it remain exible with respect to wholesale price in order to respond to demand uncertainty.
