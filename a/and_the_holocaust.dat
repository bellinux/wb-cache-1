5|$|Following World War II <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust,</b> {{large numbers}} of Hasidic and haredi Jewish {{refugees}} immigrated to Williamsburg. The congregation initially had poor relations with these groups, but these later improved with some segments of the Hasidic community. The synagogue celebrated Bunin's Silver Jubilee as rabbi in March, 1951. His work Hegyonot Yitzhak was published in 1953.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Germany {{became a}} nation state {{when most of}} the German states unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the {{revolution}} of 1918–19, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a dictatorship, World War II <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust.</b> After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, two German states were founded: the democratic West Germany and the socialist East Germany. Following the Revolutions of 1989 that ended communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, the country was reunified on 3 October 1990.|$|E
2500|$|As an {{integral}} part of the commitment to remember, <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Holocaust</b> Memorial Council <b>and</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Holocaust</b> Memorial Museum have undertaken a number of additional activities over the years to broaden public understanding of <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust,</b> to encourage preservation of artifacts and documents, and to expand scholarship <b>and</b> teaching about <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust.</b>|$|R

5|$|Michael Shermer {{argued in}} Scientific American in October 2006 that {{evolution}} supports concepts like family values, avoiding lies, fidelity, moral codes {{and the rule}} of law. He goes on to suggest that evolution gives more support to the notion of an omnipotent creator, rather than a tinkerer with limitations based on a human model, the more common image subscribed to by creationists. Careful analysis of the creationist charges that evolution has led to moral relativism <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> yields the conclusion that these charges appear to be highly suspect. Such analyses conclude that the origins of the Holocaust {{are more likely to be}} found in historical Christian anti-Semitism than in evolution.|$|E
5|$|The British were {{formally}} {{awarded the}} mandate {{to govern the}} region in 1922. The non-Jewish Palestinians revolted in 1920, 1929, and 1936. In 1947, following World War II <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Holocaust,</b> the British Government announced its desire to terminate the Mandate, and the United Nations General Assembly adopted in November 1947 a Resolution 181(II) recommending partition into an Arab state, a Jewish state and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem. The Jewish leadership accepted the proposal, but the Arab Higher Committee rejected it; a civil war began immediately after the Resolution's adoption. The State of Israel was declared in May 1948.|$|E
5|$|Vrba {{was also}} the focus of Ruth Linn's Escaping Auschwitz: A Culture of Forgetting (Cornell University Press, 2004). An {{academic}} conference was held in New York in April 2011 to discuss the Vrba–Wetzler and other Auschwitz reports, resulting in a book, The Auschwitz Reports <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> in Hungary (2011), edited by Randolph L. Braham and William vanden Heuvel and published by Columbia University Press. In 2014 historian Michael Fleming reappraised {{the impact of the}} Vrba–Wetzler report in Auschwitz, the Allies and Censorship of the Holocaust (Cambridge University Press, 2014).|$|E

5|$|Several {{interconnected}} themes {{run through}} Szabó’s films, {{the most common}} being {{the relationship between the}} personal and the political or historical. On the personal level, his first three feature films deal with coming of age issues, but political/historical events form the backdrop of these issues and continually rupture the attempts of the characters to lead their private lives. In an interview in 2008, Szabó said, “My mother once told me, ‘We had a nice childhood and our youth was beautiful, but our life was destroyed by politics and history.’” The political/historical events most commonly depicted are the dominant traumatic events of mid-20th century Hungarian and Central European history—Nazism, the Second World War, and, in Hungary—or, more accurately, Budapest—the Arrow Cross dictatorship <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust,</b> the Communist takeover, and the 1956 Revolution. Szabó himself has frequently referred to this theme as the search for security.|$|E
