40|$|The {{acetylcholine}} receptor protein (AChR) from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata is studied in its membrane-bound form by electron microscopy and single-particle image averaging. About half the molecule protrudes from the membrane surface by approximately 5 nm. The low-resolution 3 -D structure of this hydrated portion, including its handedness, can be deduced from averaged <b>axial</b> and lateral <b>projections</b> and from freeze-etched membrane surfaces. In native membrane fragments, a dimeric {{form of the}} AChR is observed and the relative orientation of the AChR monomers within the dimer is established. The dimers disappear upon disulfide reduction of the membrane preparations, whereas the average <b>axial</b> <b>projections</b> of the AChR monomer remain unaffected.

40|$|Background: The higher {{prevalence}} of venous disorders {{in the left}} lower limb is currently ascribed to compression of the left common iliac vein (LCIV) by the right common iliac artery (RCIA). This study evaluated the occurrence of LCIV compression by the left common iliac artery (LCIA). Methods: The anatomy of iliac vessels was evaluated by computed tomography (CT) in 100 asymptomatic individuals. Traditional <b>axial</b> <b>projections,</b> multiple planar, and curved planar reconstructions were used to investigate LCIV morphology. Results: Compression of the LCIV by the LCIA was found in 20 % of participants, whereas compression by the RCIA occurred in 25 % and by both iliac arteries in 21 %. <b>Axial</b> <b>projections</b> demonstrated a mean reduction in caliber of the LCIV at LCIA crossing of 22. 25 % (range 0 %- 90 %). Caliber reduction of > 20 %, 50 %, and 70 % was observed in 41, 21, and 6 individuals, respectively. The mean LCIV reduction in caliber at RCIA crossing calculated in the axial CT was 24. 49 % (range, 0 %- 95 %). Caliber reduction of > 20 %, 50 %, and 70 %, was observed in 46, 22, and 5 subjects, respectively. Multiple planar reconstructions demonstrated that {{in contrast to the}} RCIA, the compressive LCIA determines an eccentric deformation of the vein along its major axis, thus inducing a marked distortion of the lumen that varies from 22 to 37 mm. Conclusions: LCIV compression by the LCIA occurs in a relevant number of asymptomatic individuals and compression by the RCIA coexists in about one-half. The patterns of compression by LCIA correlate well with venographic and anatomic findings, which demonstrated damage of the LCIV unrelated to the RCIA crossing. Further investigations are needed to evaluate the hemodynamic and pathophysiologic implications of such compressive relationships. In fact, even if not necessarily associated with chronic venous disorders, LCIV compression by the overlying arteries must be considered a condition "permissive" of future development of chronic congestion or iliofemoral thrombosis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{simulate}} and calculate the probability of iatrogenic perforation of the scaphoid cortical bone when internal fixation appeared to be safe on radiographs. The results will assist surgeons in determining proper screw placement. Thirty scaphoids were reconstructed using computed tomography data and image-processing software. Different central axes were determined by the software to simulate the surgical views. The safe zone (SZ) and risk zone (RZ) were identified on the <b>axial</b> <b>projection</b> radiographs by comparing the scaphoid bone stenosis measured by the fluoroscopic radiographs with a three-dimensional reconstruction of the scaphoid stenosis. Each original <b>axial</b> <b>projection</b> radiograph was zoomed and compiled to match a calculated average image. The RZ, SZ, and probability of perforations in various quadrants were calculated. Using a volar view (approach), the mean risks of cortical perforation were 25 % with screws and 36 % with k-wires. Using a dorsal view (approach), the mean risks of cortical perforation were 18 % with screws and 30 % with k-wires. A high risk of perforation was detected at the ulnar-dorsal zone. Surgeons should be wary of screws that appear to lie close to the scaphoid cortex on both anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs, particularly in the ulnar-dorsal and radial-dorsal quadrants, because such screws are likely to perforate the cortex. The position of the internal fixator should be assessed using a diagram outlining the various SZs. Therapeutic, Level III...|$|E

It is yellowish-white, with a nacreous lustre and numerous yellowish-brown spots, which are darker near {{the upper part of}} each whorl and on the third whorl, the first and second being without markings. The nucleus is wanting, remaining five, slightly convex whorls with a narrow canaliculate suture. The first whorl has rather distant ribs. The next whorls have 3 spiral lirae (fine linear elevations) and radiating ribs. The last 3 whorls contain 5 spirals and thinner radiating ribs, which make the shell cancellated. These ribs become lamellose (with flared <b>axial</b> <b>projections)</b> on the lower whorls. The lirae are beaded where the ribs cross them, less obvious on the lower whorls, the uppermost of the lirae on each whorl with a series of small tubercles, giving a coronated appearance to the whorls. The body whorl is rounded, the peripheral spiral being only very little prominent. The base of the shell is convex, with 6 beaded lirae, cancellated by numerous, irregular, radiating ribs. The aperture is nearly rounded. The outer and basal margins are rounded, thin, thickened interiorly, with about 17 short lirae on the internal rib, of which that near the columella slightly tooth-like. The columella is cylindrical, rather straight, with a tooth-like fold at the base, bordering a rounded notch. The parietal wall is callous. The interior of the aperture has a few grooves.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} causes of {{misdiagnosis}} of papilledema is buried drusen of the optic nerve head [1, 2]. Optic nerve drusen are calcified concretions of unknown etiology, lo-cated within the optic nerve head just anterior to the lamina cribrosa. As these concretions enlarge they may become visible ophthalmoscopically. When buried in the nerve head, they may cause difficulties in the ophthalmoscopic differ-entiation from true papilledema. With the advent of high-resolution computed tomographic (CT) scanning, appropri-ate axial and coronal cuts can demonstrate the calcified optic nerve head drusen and save the patient from further neuroradiologic procedures [2]. Case Report A 22 -year-old woman in previously good health was first evalu-ated in 1970 for complaint of headache. Physical examination at that time revealed bi lateral elevated discs, interpreted as papill-edema. Fluorescein angiography, skull radiographs, brain scan, bilateral carotid angiograms, and ventriculogram were all normal. The possibility of optic disk drusen was then raised. The pat ient was followed for the next 10 years with this diagnosis. Because of continuing headaches and decreasing vision in the left eye, the patient was referred for neuroophthalmologic consultation in Sep-tember 1981. Optic nerve head drusen were evident ophthalmos-copica lly (figs. 1 A and 1 B). Visual field testing showed typical although marked visual field defects (fig. 1 C). To be certain {{that there was not}} a superimposed unrelated basis for visual loss, CT in both coronal and <b>axial</b> <b>projections</b> was then done, using the Pfizer 0450 / AS&E scanner with high-resolution pack in 3 mm slice thick-ness.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this paper}} was to analyze the causes of orbital {{cellulitis}} in connection with covert dental changes as well as to establish the role of radiological procedures in the final diagnosis and further treatment of such cases. Material/Methods: Thirty-two patients, aged 25 - 56, 22 women and 10 men were diagnosed and treated between January 2007 and April 2011 at the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin. The patients were examined in the infirmary of the ophthalmological department due to unilateral blepharo-oedema, abrupt pain and vision disturbances; in 5 cases, body temperature increased up to 37. 8 °C was observed. Next, the patients underwent conventional X-ray examinations of the orbit to exclude any foreign bodies in the eyeball, as well as pantomographies to evaluate the dental status. Visible periapical or periodontal changes in dentition were analyzed with intraoral X-rays with the use of DIGORA System 2. 1. Changes found in 3 patients on pantomograms and connected with iatrogenic procedures were further evaluated with CT (64 lines and 128 layers) in frontal, sagittal and <b>axial</b> <b>projections.</b> Orbital disorders were also diagnosed by an ophthalmologist and radiologist with Doppler ultrasound (US) examinations. A linear transducer of 7. 5 - 10 MHz to observe the morphology and vascularity of the eyeball was applied. Results: Iatrogenic treatment was the cause of sinusitis and cellulitis in three cases: incorrectly implanted dental implant in one case, root of the 3 rd molar pushed into the sinus in the second case, and communication between the maxillary alveolar process and the sinus after extraction in case of the third patient. Asymptomatic periapical osteolysis, periodontal disease or dead teeth were found in all cases. Diagnosis of orbital cellulitis of dental origin was determined on the basis of clinical, radiographic and ultrasound findings. Ophthalmologic and dental treatment was applied simultaneously. Conclusions: Co-operation between ophthalmologists, radiologists and dentists is necessary during the treatment of such orbital diseases...|$|R

40|$|Endomedullary femur nails with a head-neck implant {{offer an}} {{up to now}} unused point of {{reference}} for the determination of rotation during osteosynthesis. The lateral femur nail (LFN) or the long Proximal Femur Nail (long PFNA), for example, have recon screws or a blade placed at a 10 ° angle to the distal locking screw in the transversal plane.

If the posterior condylar tangential line is parallel to the axes of the hole of the distal locking screw, then the rotation or anteversion of the femur is equal to the angle between the head-neck implant and the distal locking screw which is 10 ° with LFN or long PFNA. Differing rotation angles can be made visible by rotating the C-arm from the <b>axial</b> <b>projection</b> of the distal locking screw up to the posterior condylar tangential line.

Fatigue life evaluations were made. The similar analysis of a conventional bearing can be directly obtained from the arched bearing analysis by simply letting the amount of arching be zero (g = 0) and not considering equations related to the unloaded half of the outer race. The analysis was applied to a 150 -mm angular contact ball bearing. Results for life, contact loads, and angles are shown for a conventional bearing (g = 0) and two arched bearings (g = 0. 127 mm (0. 005 in.), and 0. 254 mm (0. 010 in.)). The results indicate that an arched bearing is highly desirable for high speed applications. In particular, for a DN value of 3 million (20, 000 rpm) and an applied axial load of 4448 N (1000 lb), an arched bearing shows an improvement in life of 306 percent over that of a conventional bearing.

This work presents a method for optimizing SCP in system design and for determining SCP in system geometrical calibration. The optimiza-tion was achieved by finding the SCP that provides higher spatial resolution in terms of average-root-mean-square width of the axial point spread function (PSF) without loss of sensitivity.

The molecular {{mass of the}} antimicrobial peptide, named parasin I, was 2000. 4 Da, as determined by matrix-associated laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The complete amino acid sequence of parasin I, which was determined by automated Edman degradation, was Lys-Gly-Arg-Gly-Lys-Gln-Gly-Gly-Lys-Val-Arg-Ala-Lys-Ala-Lys-Thr-Arg-Ser-Ser. Eighteen of the 19 residues in parasin I were identical to the N-terminal of buforin I, a 39 -residue antimicrobial peptide derived from the N-terminal of toad histone H 2 A [Kim et al. (1996) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 229, 381 – 387], which implies that parasin I was cleaved off from the N-terminal of catfish histone H 2 A. Parasin I showed strong antimicrobial activity, about 12 – 100 times more potent than magainin 2, against {{a wide spectrum of}} microorganisms, without any hemolytic activity. Circular dichroism spectra of parasin I indicated a structural content of 11 % α-helix, 33 % β-sheet, and 56 % random coils.

We used open reduction and internal fixation with a calcaneal LCP for the treatment of 98 patients with 114 calcaneal fractures in our department from August 2005 till December 2011.

METHODS: Thirty-one patients underwent cineangiocardiographic study with <b>axial</b> <b>projections.</b> Their ages ranged from 1 to 50 days (x = 9. 6), and 28 of them were studied during {{the first month of}} life. The statistical analysis comprised the following: chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test for the mean and standard deviation, multiple regression, and the 95 % confidence interval (95 %CI) was calculated. The significance level adopted was alpha < 0. 05. RESULTS: The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the angiographic morphology of the right ventricle (RV) : group A - tripartite RV (n= 16); group B - bipartite RV (n= 9); and group C - unipartite RV (n= 6). The diameter of the tricuspid valve was 10. 28 ± 2. 67 mm (A); 7. 82 ± 3. 41 (B); and 5. 27 ± 0. 57 (C) (P= 0. 0005). Pulmonary atresia was of the valvular type in all group A patients and of the infundibular type in all group C patients (P< 0. 0001). Coronary-cavitary connections were rare (2 / 16) in group A patients, but occurred in all group C patients (P= 0. 0006), with retrograde opacity of the aorta (flow from the RV to the aorta) in 2 group A patients and in all group C patients (P= 0. 0003). Three patients (2 in group C and 1 in group A) had right-ventricular-dependent coronary circulation. Isolated moderate/severe tricuspid regurgitation showed a tendency towards being more frequent in group A (P= 0. 0525). The angle of the ductus arteriosus with the descending aorta was as follows: 104. 06 ± 8. 98 in group A; 79. 17 ± 33. 08 in group B; and 39. 0 ± 6. 52 in group C (P= 0. 0016). The correlation between the diameter of the tricuspid valve and the angle of the ductus arteriosus with the descending aorta was 0. 6568 (P= 0. 0002). CONCLUSION: Because of the heterogeneity of the morphology of the RV in patients with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, knowledge about all these data is required for selecting candidates for the different therapeutic procedures...|$|R

Information about associated ocular surface and pathologic eyelid findings were collected from all patients with involutional eyelid malposition. Patients with involutional entropion and ectropion underwent measurements of the <b>axial</b> ocular globe <b>projection.</b> the Pearson chi-square test and the Mann-Whitney U test were performed. Results: the prevalence of involutional entropion was 2. 1 %; 1. 9 % in men and 2. 4 % in women. the prevalence of involutional ectropion was 2. 9 %; 5. 1 % in men and 1. 5 % in women. Dry eye syndrome, lower retractor laxity, and superficial punctate keratopathy were seen significantly more often in patients with involutional entropion than in those with involutional ectropion (p < 0. 001). Chronic conjunctivitis was significantly more common in patients with involutional ectropion than in those with involutional entropion (p < 0. 001). the <b>axial</b> ocular globe <b>projection</b> was significantly smaller in patients with involutional entropion than in those with involutional ectropion (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: the prevalence of involutional entropion and ectropion in the elderly population is 2. 1 % and 2. 9 %, respectively. the axial ocular globe position plays a pathogenic role in involutional lower eyelid malposition.

40|$|The main {{theme of}} this {{bachelor}} work is to evaluate the indication of single imaging methods for examinations {{in the area of}} the patellofemoral joint. The work contains shortly summarized anatomy-physiology conditions in this area, including anatomy variations of the patella and the patellofemoral joint pathology. The work continues with a description of single indicated imaging methods. The basic is a skiagraphy examination, every single projection is described in details, including a historical overview of the <b>axial</b> patella <b>projection.</b> Other methods which are mentioned are the artrography, the magnetic resonance imaging, the computed tomography and the scintigraphy. Issues of contraindications and risks for patients related to examinations are mentioned, too. A level of suitability how to use other examination methods, especially MRI, is considered on a chosen patient sample. At first plain pictures were done, some patients undertook ultrasonography examination and finally a magnetic resonance imaging examination was indicated. The computed tomography and the scintigraphy are not usually used for patellofemoral joint indications. The author compares financial and time demands of each method. The cheapest seem to be plain pictures and the sonography, on the other hand the most expensive is the magnetic resonance imaging, which is also the best way in the diagnostics at the same time. The magnetic resonance imaging method is the most contributory for a valuation of cartilages and tender joint parts. The time demands make a part of the comparison, too...|$|R
40|$|Spiralin is {{the major}} {{membrane}} protein of the helical mollicute Spiroplasma citri. A similar protein occurs in the membrane of Spiroplasma melliferum, an organism related to S. citri. The gene encoding spiralin has been sequenced. A restriction fragment of the spiralin gene {{has been used as}} a probe to detect the gene encoding S. melliferum spiralin. A 4. 6 -kilobase-pair ClaI DNA fragment from S. melliferum strongly hybridized with the probe. This fragment was inserted in pBR 322 and cloned in Escherichia coli. It was further subcloned in the replicative forms of M 13 mp 18 and M 13 mp 19, and its nucleotide sequence was determined (GenBank accession number M 33991). An open reading frame showing 88. 6 % base sequence homology with the S. citri spiralin gene could be identified and was assumed to be the gene encoding S. melliferum spiralin. The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein had 75 % homology with the spiralin sequence. In particular, the two proteins possess a stretch of 20 amino acids which can form an alpha-helix, in which all polar amino acids occupy approximately one-third of the <b>axial</b> <b>projection</b> down the helix. On the basis of these data and published data, we propose a topological model for the structural organization of the spiralin in the cell membrane of spiroplasmas...|$|E
40|$|Raglan Range {{consists}} dominantly of pelitic schists, quartzites, and ortho-amphibolites generally of garnet grade. This is the Franklin Group, and overlies Mary Group phyllites of chlorite grade. All are Precambrian. Precambrian structures show {{a regional}} and systematic departure from homoaxiality {{due to a}} rotation 'about an axis trending 326 degrees (true), and plunging 24 degrees This is the expression of Tabberabberan folding. Unrolling about this axis reveals a uniformly gently dipping alternation of schist and quartzite {{over most of the}} area. Two Precambrian deformations are recognisable, here termed SI and S 2. Associated with SI is the regional metamorphism producing chlorite, biotite, a amandine, kyanite in a zonal arrangement. The biotite isograd is taken as the upper limit of the Mary Group. S 2 is accompanied by retrograde metamorphism and large scale recumbent folding, during which metamorphic zones were inverted, and the Franklin Group was transported over the Mary Group, possibly in a south-west direction. The Governor River Phyllite, herein defined, is a wide zone of dispersed movement associated with S 2. Albite of metasomatic origin crystallised in the interval between SI and S 2. Quartzites show R-tectonite micro-fabric. The quartz fabric is homogeneous, irrespective of tectonic position, hut the mica fabric is unrollable. Lineation in quartzite is due to the intersection of SI surfaces with an older surface, probably bedding. Lineation in schist is the intersection of the SI surfaces and axial surfaces related to the S 2 folds. Approximately coaxial relationships between SI, S 2 and the Tabberabberan folding permits a construction of a tectonic profile of the Raglan Range by <b>axial</b> <b>projection.</b> Lamprophyre dykes, probably Tabberabberan in age intrude the schists. ...|$|E
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{determining}} net interactions between actin and myosin filaments in muscle cells, perhaps the single most informative view of the myofilament lattice is its averaged <b>axial</b> <b>projection.</b> We have studied frozen-hydrated transverse thin sections {{with the goal of}} obtaining axial projections that are not subject to the limitations of conventional thin sectioning (suspect preservation of native structure) or of equatorial x-ray diffraction analysis (lack of experimental phases). In principle, good preservation of native structure may be achieved with fast freezing, followed by low-dose electron imaging of unstained vitrified cryosections. In practice, however, cryosections undergo large-scale distortions, including irreversible compression; furthermore, phase contrast imaging results in a nonlinear relationship between the projected density of the specimen and the optical density of the micrograph. To overcome these limitations, we have devised methods of image restoration and generalized correlation averaging, and applied them to cryosections of rabbit psoas fibers in both the relaxed and rigor states. Thus visualized, myosin filaments appear thicker than actin filaments by a much smaller margin than in conventional thin sections, and particularly so for rigor muscle. This may result from a significant fraction of the myosin S 1 -cross-bridges averaging out in projection and thus contributing only to the baseline of projected density. Entering rigor incurs a loss of density from an annulus around the myosin filament, with a compensating accumulation of density around the actin filament. This redistribution of mass represents attachment of the fraction of cross-bridges that are visible above background. Myosin filaments in the "nonoverlap" zone appear to broaden on entering rigor, suggesting that on deprivation of ATP, cross-bridges in situ move outwards even without actin in their immediate proximity...|$|E
40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{test was}} carried out on a sample of 11 patients, 8 women and 3 men, suffering from pleomorphic adenoma of the minor salivary glands of the palate. These sample patients were treated at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery at the University of Rome "La Sapienza" between 1 / 1 / 90 and 31 / 12 / 95. Some diagnostic methodologies have been analysed, such as incisional biopsy and instrumental research (X-ray Orthopantomography and CT of the maxillofacial district with and without contrast medium in <b>axial</b> and coronal <b>projections),</b> surgical techniques {{for the removal of}} the neoformation and techniques for an immediate reconstruction. The surgical treatment foresaw, during the same operation, removal of the neoformation, reconstruction of the resulting defect and complete restoration of functions and aesthetics. The patients of the examined sample underwent a 5 -year follow-up, based on clinical examinations and instrumental research. No immediate or delayed postoperative complications were evident, nor recurrence of the neoplasia. The purpose of this assignment is to compare the results that transpired from the retrospective test with those reported in the international bibliography...|$|R
40|$|Th e goal of {{this work}} was to analyze {{asymmetry}} of hippocampal formation in PTSD patients. Th e objects of the analysis were MRI scans of patients with PTSD with established cog-nitive function damage. MRI scans were obtained using MAGNET IMPACT SIEMENS, TESLA in T and T relaxation. Th e measurement of hippocampal formation dimensions, and comparisons between {{the right and the}} left side were done using evaluate- distance program on the MRI instrument of the Institute of Radiology at Sarajevo Clinics Center. We tested patients with PTSD, years of average age with standard deviation of, years. Based on the analysis of our results regarding the size of hippocampal formation in all the three <b>projections</b> (<b>axial,</b> coronal and sagital), in the group of patients with PTSD, we can the make the following observations:. In axial slice the length of hippocampal formation measured on the left and right side is signifi cantly asymmetric in all patients. In the sagital slice, the hippocampal formation mea-sured on the left side is in many cases longer than in the right –. In coronal slice no signifi cant diff erences were found in the proportion of patients according to symmetry/asymmetry of hippocampal formation width on the left and right.. Th e diff erence in average size of hippocampal formation between the left and right side measured in axial and coronal slices is not statistically signifi cant, but it is signifi cant in sagitall slice. So, the results of this new research, showed smaller hippocampal dimensions in PTSD as measured using MRI. We have to be careful about what projection we are refusing to as being watched hippocampal formation because the results will depend on that. We suggest that fu-ture studies be done in more projections because of the importance of statistically signifi cant conclusions. MRI – volumetric measurements have their value.

40|$|O presente estudo analisou os efeitos da fratura de côndilo unilateral, no período de crescimento. Para tanto, foram utilizados 50 ratos jovens, linhagem Wistar, com peso até 100 g. Sob anestesia geral foi realizada no grupo {{experimental}} fratura do processo condilar no lado direito com desvio e no grupo controle-operado, foi feito apenas acesso cirúrgico ao côndilo. O sacrifício dos animais foi feito aos três meses de idade. A mandíbula foi desarticulada sendo obtidas as incidências radiográficas axial do crânio seco e lateral das hemi-mandíbulas. Foram feitas mensurações cefalométricas por meio de um sistema de computador. Foram aplicados os testes estatísticos t de Student entre os grupos e teste t de Student para dados pareados entre os lados, dentro de cada grupo. Houve diferença significante entre os grupos para o lado direito no comprimento das porções anterior (p= 0, 001) e posterior (0, 017) da maxila e altura do ramo mandibular (p= 0, 001). Houve diferença significante entre os lados para o comprimento da mandíbula (p< 0, 001) e altura do ramo mandibular (p< 0, 001), nos grupos experimental e controle-operado. Houve diferença significante para a altura do corpo mandibular (p= 0. 001) e para o comprimento das porções anterior (p= 0, 002) e posterior (p= 0, 001) da maxila apenas no grupo experimental. Os resultados obtidos permitiram concluir que uma fratura de côndilo mandibular experimental durante o período de crescimento em ratos levou a uma assimetria da mandíbula na altura do corpo mandibular, com conseqüências também para a maxila. The {{present study}} analyzed {{the effects of}} the condyle fracture were analyzed in the growing period in this study. Fifty young Wistar rats weighting 100 g were used. Under general anestesia fracture of the condilar process on the right side with deviation was performed in the experimental group, while only the made surgical access was performed in the sham-operated group. The animals were sacrifized with three months of age. The mandible was disarticulated, and radiographic <b>projections</b> <b>axial</b> of dried skull and lateral of the hemimandible were obtained. Cephalometric mensurations through a computer system were made. Statistical tests "t" of Student between the groups and paired test "t" of Student among the sides, inside of each group were applied. There was a significant different among the groups to the right side in the length of the anterior portion (p= 0, 001) and posterior (0, 017) of the maxilla and height of the mandibular ramus (p= 0, 001). There was significant difference among the sides for the length of the mandible (p < 0, 001) and height of the mandibular ramus (p< 0, 001), in the height of the body mandibular (p= 0. 001) and for the length of the anterior portions (p= 0, 002) and posterior (p= 0, 001) of the maxilla just in the experimental group. The obtained results allowed to conclude that a experimental fracture of mandibular condyle during the growing period in rats induced an asymmetry of the mandible in the height of the mandibular body, with also consequences to the maxilla...|$|R
