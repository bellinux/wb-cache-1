5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> solar {{electricity}} has fallen, {{the number of}} grid-connected solar PV systems has grown into the millions and utility-scale solar power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun. The current largest photovoltaic power station {{in the world is}} the 850MW Longyangxia Dam Solar Park, in Qinghai, China.|$|E
5|$|Astrid ran aground off {{the coast}} of Ireland on 24 July 2013, and {{subsequently}} sank, with all on board rescued. She was salvaged on 9 September 2013, but <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> restoring her was too high she was scrapped and broken up by April 2014.|$|E
5|$|The cost of {{constructing}} {{the network has}} been covered by the ministry. The costs of operating and maintaining the network are covered by the users, who also purchase their own terminals. Payment to the directorate is by an annual subscription fee per terminal, based on the terminal's use. For a terminal only used for stand-by, the annual subscription cost is NOK1,700 per year (2016), while that for a terminal in a control room is NOK45,000 (2016). <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> running the network is fixed independently {{of the amount of}} traffic, there is no cost for using the network. As additional users start implementing the system, the costs per subscriber will be reduced.|$|E
30|$|The {{decision}} to migrate, whether internal or international, is often viewed <b>as</b> an investment. <b>The</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> migration, which include <b>the</b> physical <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> move <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> adjusting {{to a new}} location, are incurred in order to earn higher income in the future. When exploring international migration, these adjustment costs have been viewed <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> adapting to <b>the</b> labor market in the destination country. A large part <b>of</b> these adjustment <b>costs</b> may be <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> investing in human capital at <b>the</b> destination, such <b>as</b> becoming more fluent in a language.|$|R
30|$|With <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> data {{transmission}} decreasing <b>as</b> fast <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> computing power, practical opportunities for global teleradiology are rapidly increasing <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> PACS and digital radiology increases. In our financially constrained world, the clinical losses associated with generalised use of teleradiology may {{be accepted by}} governments and health care insurers as a means <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> containment [1].|$|R

5|$|There {{were large}} cost overruns with the {{telescope}}'s construction, mainly {{due to the}} steeply rising cost of steel {{at the time the}} telescope was constructed. The original grant for the telescope's construction came jointly from the Nuffield Foundation and the government; this amounted to £335,000. The government increased its share of the funding several times <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the telescope rose; other money came from private donations. The final part of the debt from the construction of the telescope, £50,000, was paid off by Lord Nuffield and the Nuffield Foundation on 25 May 1960 (partly due to the telescope's early, very public role in space probe tracking; see below), and Jodrell Bank observatory was renamed to the Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories. The final total cost for the telescope was £700,000.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses {{and other}} coleoid {{cephalopods}} {{are capable of}} greater RNA editing (which involves changes to the nucleic acid sequence of the primary transcript of RNA molecules) than any other organisms. Editing is concentrated in the nervous system and affects proteins involved in neural excitability and neuronal morphology. More than 60% of RNA transcripts for coleoid brains are recoded by editing, compared to less than 1% for a human or fruit fly. Coleoids rely mostly on ADAR enzymes for RNA editing, which requires large double-stranded RNA structures to flank to the editing sites. Both the structures and editing sites are conserved in the coleoid genome and the mutation rates for the sites are severely hampered. Hence, greater transcriptome plasticity has come <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> slower genome evolution. High levels of RNA editing {{do not appear to}} be present in more basal cephalopods or other molluscs.|$|E
25|$|Breastfeeding {{is cheaper}} than alternatives, {{but is not}} free of cost. The mother {{generally}} must eat more food than otherwise. In the US, the extra money spent on food (about US$ each week) is usually about half as much money <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> infant formula.|$|E
50|$|Climate {{protection}} is both worthwhile and feasible: Investing in climate {{protection is}} economically efficient, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> effective climate protection are far lower than <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> inaction.|$|R

25|$|The {{national}} stock market, the TUNINDEX, fell on 12 January for a {{three consecutive}} day loss of 9.3%. Following the curfew in Tunis, the market index again fell 3.8% <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> protecting against a sovereign default in credit default swaps rose to {{its highest level}} in almost two years.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> DNA oligonucleotides {{synthesis}} falls, artificial {{synthesis of}} a complete gene is now a viable method for introducing mutation into gene. This method allows for extensive mutagenesis over multiples sites, including the complete redesign of the codon usage of gene to optimise it for a particular organism.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> {{computer}} {{power to}} the consumer falls, the cost for producers to fulfill Moore's law follows an opposite trend: R, manufacturing, and test costs have increased steadily with each new generation of chips. Rising manufacturing costs are an important consideration for the sustaining of Moore's law.|$|E
50|$|In {{regions that}} {{suffer from a}} high {{prevalence}} of infectious diseases, {{both men and women}} report lower levels <b>of</b> sociosexuality, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> an incautious lifestyle (i.e., being unrestricted) may outweigh the benefits.|$|R

50|$|The {{election}} of judges, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> running for office, have been criticized. Median spending for a judicial {{office of the}} Los Angeles County Superior Court has risen from $3,177 in 1970 to $70,000 in 1994.|$|R
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> land {{within the}} urban service {{boundary}} of Fayette County increases {{due to the}} diminishing amount of plots appropriate for development, and as people's interest in living downtown has seen a resurgence, several new projects are either in planning, under construction, or have already been finished.|$|E
25|$|The British Government {{had opened}} up an {{evacuation}} account {{for each of the}} Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey, to which certain costs could be charged, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the evacuation ships, rail travel and the education costs of children. There were concerns over helping Channel Island private schools with their costs as British private schools received no help when evacuated from cities.|$|E
25|$|Today, most general {{aviation}} piston engine powered aircraft are naturally aspirated. Modern aviation piston engines designed {{to run at}} high altitudes typically include a turbocharger (either high pressure or turbonormalized) rather than a supercharger. The change in thinking {{is largely due to}} economics. Aviation gasoline was once plentiful and cheap, favoring the simple, but fuel-hungry supercharger. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> fuel has increased, the supercharger has fallen out of favor.|$|E
50|$|The {{benefits}} of trade agreements {{for developing countries}} are not automatic, especially for SMEs {{whether or not they}} are already exporting <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> entering a new market are greater for them than for large companies when compared to their potential revenue.|$|R

25|$|The {{enrollment}} {{in private schools}} declines sharply after primary level, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> attendance in private schools increases {{and the majority of}} the population cannot afford private education in Pakistan. The total number of students enrolled in private schools at middle level is 1,619,630. Of the total level of {{enrollment in}} private schools, 66% students are in urban schools. Hence, the ratio of boys and girls is relatively balanced with 54% boys and 46% girls.|$|E
25|$|Early bridges were {{vulnerable}} to floods, and in 1309 many bridges were washed away or damaged by severe winter floods, including Hethbeth Bridge. In 1683 the same bridge was partially {{destroyed by a}} flood that also meant {{the loss of the}} bridge at Newark. Historical archives often record details of the bridge repairs that followed floods, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> these repairs or pontage had to be raised by borrowing money and charging a local toll.|$|E
25|$|The {{advancement}} of steam power machinery in the 19th century {{brought about a}} revolution in wine press technology as manual basket press gave way to steam-powered presses that greatly increased the efficiency of pressing and reduced the amount labor needed to operate a press. Even the {{advancement of}} rail transport had a positive influence <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> transporting large wine presses from manufacturers to wine regions throughout the globe decreased and more wineries began being able to afford purchasing a wine press.|$|E

25|$|The former {{canal and}} subway tunnels {{have become a}} {{frequent}} source of debate. Several city homeless use the tunnels for shelter, and a few areas near tunnel entrances have gained the reputation as being dangerous. The city has considered multiple solutions for the space including recreating a canal way, putting the subway system back in or filling the tunnels entirely. The plan to fill the tunnels in completely has generated criticism <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> filling would not generate nor leverage economic development.|$|E
25|$|Assessments often {{suggest that}} GHG {{emissions}} {{can be reduced}} using a portfolio of low-carbon technologies. At the core of most proposals is the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through reducing energy waste and switching to low-carbon power sources of energy. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> reducing GHG emissions in the electricity sector appears to be lower than in other sectors, {{such as in the}} transportation sector, the electricity sector may deliver the largest proportional carbon reductions under an economically efficient climate policy.|$|E
25|$|Any non-liquid {{assets are}} {{generally}} {{sold by the}} DCO at a public auction.
