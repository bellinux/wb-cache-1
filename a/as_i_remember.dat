And, as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> the {{particular}} reason why she liked the result of Acton's recipe above all others was because it had this unusual lightness to it, yet also seemed to offer up the required richness too." ...|$|E

It is {{revealed}} that Caballero, an enforcer for the local drug cartel, is a [...] "memory vampire": he can absorb the memories of those posing {{a threat to the}} cartel. Reyes finds Doggett and faces gunfire from the police, who are likewise controlled by the cartel; all the while, Reyes attempts to remind Doggett of who they are. Doggett remembers his son. The agents are rescued by Skinner and the Mexican Federales. Doggett tearfully admits that he is happy to have all of his memories, even the bad ones, [...] "as long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the good.” ...|$|E
500|$|Isaacson married Anne McIntyre in Melbourne on 21December 1950. The couple, who {{had known}} each other since their teens, had delayed their wedding during Anne's five-year {{struggle}} with polio and Isaacson carried his future bride to the registry office on the day. The marriage produced two sons. On 10June 1991 Isaacson was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia [...] "for services to the print media and the community". He published <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Remember</b> Them: Men and Women Who Shaped a Life, a collection of eulogies he had delivered for friends and colleagues, in 2012. In May of that year he was among a group of thirty-two veterans selected to attend the dedication of the RAF Bomber Command Memorial in London as part of the official Australian delegation. Isaacson was a Life Governor of the Victorian Shrine of Remembrance, having previously served as a Trustee from 1956 to 2000, and Chairman from 1983 to 2000. He and his wife lived in the Melbourne suburb of Toorak. Issaacson died on 7 April 2017 in Melbourne at the age of 96, following a short illness. He was survived by his sons; Anne had died the year before.|$|E

500|$|Harris was {{followed}} into the witness-box by {{a succession of}} landladies, waitresses and other women, all of whom confirmed Davidson's habitual pestering without making any serious accusation of misconduct. [...] When Davidson himself took to the stand, on 25 May, his light-hearted, even flippant, manner created, says Tucker, [...] "the flavour of a comedy routine with the rector's counsel as straight man". Davidson's disastrous finances were aired—he took great offence when his association with Gordon was presented as a [...] "partnership in crime". [...] He caused disbelief and amusement in the court when, questioned about the boil-lancing incident with Rose Ellis, he professed not to know what a [...] "buttock" [...] was, claiming: [...] "It is a phrase I have honestly never heard. So far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{it is a little}} below the waist." [...] At this stage, only Harris's largely uncorroborated testimony had provided specific allegations of immorality; the rest of the evidence was inconclusive and it seemed that the prosecution might fail. Davidson's cause was severely damaged, however, when Oliver produced a photograph of him, taken on 28 March 1932, with a nearly naked girl. She was Estelle Douglas, the 15-year-old daughter of one of Davidson' oldest friends. Davidson explained that the picture had been intended as a publicity shot to help the girl find work as an actress. He protested that he had been set up, and did not know she was naked under her shawl; he thought she was wearing a bathing suit, as she had been in an earlier photograph. [...] On 6 June, after closing speeches from both sides, the court adjourned until 8 July to allow the chancellor, who alone would determine the outcome, to consider the evidence.|$|E

2500|$|After {{stuffing}} the fowl with snow, Bacon contracted a fatal case of pneumonia. Some people, including Aubrey, {{consider these}} two contiguous, possibly coincidental events as related and causative of his death: [...] "The Snow so chilled {{him that he}} immediately fell so extremely ill, {{that he could not}} return to his Lodging ... but went to the Earle of Arundel's house at Highgate, where they put him into ... a damp bed that had not been layn-in ... which gave him such a cold that in 2 or 3 days <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> Mr Hobbes told me, he died of Suffocation." [...] Aubrey has been criticised for his evident credulousness in this and other works; on the other hand, he knew Thomas Hobbes, Bacon's fellow-philosopher and friend.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Mullins {{released}} {{a pair of}} albums entitled The World As Best <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Remember</b> It, Volume One and Volume Two. These featured a more [...] stripped-back, acoustic feel than his earlier work, with nods to Irish music. [...] "Step By Step", a song written by his friend Beaker and included on volume one, and incorporated into [...] "Sometimes By Step" [...] with additional lyrics by Mullins on volume two, became an instant hit on Christian radio, and, like [...] "Awesome God", it became a popular praise chorus. Both during and after Mullin's college years, Beaker was a substantial influence on Mullins and his music. Beaker co-wrote, performed, and toured with Mullins for several years. The first song they wrote together was [...] "Boy Like Me, Man Like You", a 1991 hit for Mullins. Mullins wrote his hit song [...] "Let Mercy Lead" [...] for Beaker's son Aiden.|$|E
2500|$|Buechner recalls of {{his accomplishments}} at Exeter: [...] "All told, {{we were there}} for nine years with one year's leave of absence tucked in the middle, {{and by the time}} we left, the {{religion}} department had grown from only one full-time teacher, namely myself, and about twenty students, to four teachers and something in the neighborhood, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> of three hundred students or more." [...] Among these students was the future author John Irving, who included a quotation from Buechner in the preface of his book A Prayer for Owen Meany. One of Buechner's biographers, Marjorie Casebier McCoy, describes the effect of his time at Exeter as follows: [...] "Buechner in his sermons had been attempting to reach out to the [...] "cultured despisers of religion." [...] The students and faculty at Phillips Exeter had been, for the most part, just that when he had arrived at the school, and it had been they who compelled him to hone his preaching and literary skills to their utmost in order to get a hearing for Christian faith." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pisemsky {{spent the}} first ten {{years of his life}} in the small {{regional}} town of Vetluga where his father served as Mayor. Later he moved with his parents to the countryside. Pisemsky described the years he spent there in Chapter 2 of People of the Forties, an autobiographical novel in which he figured under the name of Pasha. Fond of hunting and horseback riding, the boy received scant education: his tutors were a local deacon, a defrocked drunkard, and a strange old man who was known to have toured the area for decades, giving lessons. Aleksey learned reading, writing, arithmetics, Russian and Latin from them. In his autobiography Pisemsky wrote: [...] "Nobody had ever forced me to learn, and I wasn't an avid learner, but I read a lot and that was my passion: by 14 I consumed, in translation, of course, most of Walter Scott's novels, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, Faublas, Le Diable boiteux, The Serapion Brethren, a Persian novel called Haggi Baba... As for children's books, I couldn't stand them and, as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> now, considering them very silly." [...] Pisemsky wrote scornfully of his primary education and regretted failing to learn any languages besides Latin. He found in himself, however, a natural predisposition to mathematics, logic and aesthetics.|$|E
2500|$|... ″The ancient chapel {{belonging}} {{to the town of}} Penzance may be seen in a fish cellar, near the key; it is small and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> had the image of the Virgin Mary in it.″ The chapel was built of greenstone and about 30ft in length and 15ft in breadth of which only a fragment remained in situ. In around 1800 the chapel was converted to a fish cellar. A carving in [...] "Ludgvan granite" [...] thought to be of St Anthony was removed in about 1830 and was used in the wall of a pig sty, which was further vandalised in 1850 when [...] "a stranger ... taking fancy to the stony countenance and rough hands, they were broken off and carried away as relics ...". The remains of the vandalised relic were taken to St Mary's Churchyard by a mason who told Mr Millett that he [...] "popped St Raffidy into a wheelbarrow and trundle him off to the chapel yard." [...] The carving remains in St Mary’s Churchyard and has been dated by Prof Charles Thomas as early 12th century. There are no early documents mentioning the dedication to St Anthony; this seems to depend entirely on tradition and may be groundless. A licence for Divine Service in the Chapel of St Gabriel and St Raphael was granted in 1429, but nothing more is known of this chapel except, possibly, for the mason who mentioned ″St Raffidy″ in 1850. Adjoining the chapel is St Anthony's Gardens, named in 1933 and containing an archway said to have been taken from the chapel site.|$|E
