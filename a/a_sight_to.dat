25|$|Apart {{from the}} Indian Buddhist traditions {{in the form}} of Viharas seen {{in various parts of the}} country, Tibetan Buddhist monasteries have also made a lasting impact in Karnataka with the influx of {{refugees}} from Tibet who were settled in Bylakuppe. One of the famous monasteries is the Namdroling monastery, built as per traditional Tibetan architecture, which is located in Bylakuppe near Kushalnagar in Kodagu in Karnataka. This spectacular Tibetan Golden Temple is a major tourist spot in the area. It is termed the ‘Charming mini Tibet near Madikeri’. Tibetan refugees have both recreated their lifestyle as well as adapted to the local conditions around the monasteries.

500|$|Neon (Greek [...] (néon), neuter {{singular}} form of νέος meaning [...] "new"), {{was discovered}} in 1898 by the British chemists Sir William Ramsay (1852–1916) and Morris W. Travers (1872–1961) in London. Neon was discovered when Ramsay chilled a sample of air until it became a liquid, then warmed the liquid and captured the gases as they boiled off. The gases nitrogen, oxygen, and argon had been identified, but the remaining gases were isolated in roughly their order of abundance, in a six-week period beginning {{at the end of}} May 1898. First to be identified was krypton. The next, after krypton had been removed, was a gas which gave a brilliant red light under spectroscopic discharge. This gas, identified in June, was named neon, the Greek analogue of [...] "novum", (new), suggested by Ramsay's son. The characteristic brilliant red-orange color emitted by gaseous neon when excited electrically was noted immediately; Travers later wrote, [...] "the blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story and was <b>a</b> <b>sight</b> <b>to</b> dwell upon and never forget." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore is {{particularly}} known for playing troubled women, and specializes in [...] "ordinary women who suppress powerful emotions". Oliver Burkeman of The Guardian writes that her characters are typically [...] "struggling {{to maintain a}} purchase on normality {{in the face of}} some secret anguish or creeping awareness of failure". Suzie Mackenzie, also of The Guardian, has identified a theme of [...] "characters in a state of alienation... women who have forgotten or lost themselves. People whose identity is a question." [...] Her performances often include small hints at emotional turmoil, until there comes a point when the character breaks. The journalist Kira Cochrane has identified this as a [...] "trademark moment" [...] in many of her best films, while it has led Burkeman to call her the [...] "queen of the big-screen breakdown". [...] "When she does finally crack," [...] writes journalist Simon Hattenstone, [...] "it's <b>a</b> <b>sight</b> <b>to</b> behold: nobody sobs from the soul quite like Moore." [...] Ben Brantley of The New York Times has praised Moore's ability to subtly reveal the inner-turmoil of her characters, writing that she is [...] "peerless" [...] in her [...] "portraits of troubled womanhood." [...] When it comes to more authoritative roles, Brantley believes she is [...] "a bit of a bore". [...] "Emotional nakedness is Ms. Moore's specialty," [...] he says, [...] "and it's here that you sense the magic she is capable of." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1971 Candidates matches, Fischer {{was set to}} {{play against}} Soviet {{grandmaster}} and concert pianist Mark Taimanov in the quarter-finals. [...] "Their match was to begin in May 1971 in Vancouver, Canada, on the beautiful campus of the University of British Columbia." [...] "Analysts and players alike predicted that Fischer would win the Candidates, but not without a struggle. Tal predicted that Fischer would win 5½–4½ against Taimanov." [...] " [...] saw himself as the firm favorite in the Taimanov match. He was not alone; the noncommunist press was of the same mind. Only Taimanov insisted that he could win, dismissing Fischer as a mere computer". Taimanov had reason to be confident. He was backed by the firm guidance of Botvinnik, who [...] "had thoroughly analysed Fischer's record and put together a 'dossier' on him", from {{when he was in}} talks to play Fischer in a match [...] "a couple of years earlier". After Fischer defeated Taimanov in the second game of the match, Taimanov asked Fischer how he managed {{to come up with the}} move 12. N1c3, to which Fischer replied [...] "that the idea was not his—he had come across it in the monograph by the Soviet master Alexander Nikitin in a footnote". Taimanov said of this: [...] "It is staggering that I, an expert on the Sicilian, should have missed this theoretically significant idea by my compatriot, while Fischer had uncovered it in a book in a foreign language!" [...] With the score at 4–0, in Fischer's favor, the fifth game adjournment was <b>a</b> <b>sight</b> <b>to</b> behold. Schonberg explains the scene:Taimanov came to Vancouver with two seconds, both grandmasters. Fischer was alone. He thought that the sight of Taimanov and his seconds was the funniest thing he had ever seen. There Taimanov and his seconds would sit, six hands flying, pocket sets waving in the air, while variations were being spouted all over the place. And there sat Taimanov with a confused look on his face. Just before resuming play [...] the seconds were giving Taimanov some last-minute advice. When poor Taimanov entered the playing room and sat down to confront Fischer, his head was so full of conflicting continuations that he became rattled, left a Rook en prise and immediately resigned. Fischer beat Taimanov by the score of 6–0. [...] "The record books showed that the only comparable achievement to the 6–0 score against Taimanov was Wilhelm Steinitz's 7–0 win against Joseph Henry Blackburne in 1876 in an era of more primitive defensive technique." [...] "Who would have imagined that any challenger's match would ever have been decided by a perfect score, when the participants are all to be ranked among the strongest players in the world?" [...] "It is difficult to portray to non-chess players the magnitude of such a shutout. A typical result between well-matched players might be, say, six wins to four, with nine draws". Taimanov later recalled, [...] "When Grand Masters play, they see the logic of their opponent's moves. One's moves may be so powerful that the other may not be able to stop him, but the plan behind the moves will be clear. Not so with Fischer. His moves did not make sense..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Neon is a {{noble gas}} {{chemical}} element and an inert gas {{that is a}} minor component of the Earth's atmosphere. It was discovered in 1898 by the British scientists William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers. When Ramsay and Travers had succeeded in obtaining pure neon from the atmosphere, they explored its properties using an [...] "electrical gas-discharge" [...] tube that {{was similar to the}} tubes used today for neon signs. Travers later wrote, [...] "the blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story and was <b>a</b> <b>sight</b> <b>to</b> dwell upon and never forget." [...] The procedure of examining the colors of the light emitted from gas-discharge (or [...] "Geissler" [...] tubes) was well-known at the time, since the colors of light (the [...] "spectral lines") emitted by a gas discharge tube are, essentially, fingerprints that identify the gases inside.|$|E

According to crew member Ted Guzda, [...] "We knew when the invasion would come because the channel was so full of ships you couldn’t count them. The sea was so rough that when we started we couldn’t make it." [...] Executive officer, Lt.
