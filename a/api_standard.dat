Inclusion of oil-flooded screw compressors into <b>API</b> <b>Standards</b> (<b>API</b> 619, 1997) and with its expanding role into process compression applications, makes it necessary to present the authors? experiences and share their acquired know-how. Higher reliability, lower maintenance costs, no pulsation, no extensive foundations, lower operational costs, lower initial costs, and many environmentally friendly qualities are some of the basic attributes of an oil-flooded rotary screw compressor. Those attributes are resulting in a significant demand for such machines, primarily as an alternative to reciprocating compressors...|$|R
