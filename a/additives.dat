5|$|In 1820 Accum {{began the}} public {{struggle}} against harmful food <b>additives</b> with his book entitled A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons. Some <b>additives</b> derived from plants, {{and used as}} preservatives or to alter tastes or appearance, had already been in use for some time. The beginning of the 19th century saw a rapid increase in the industrial preparation and packaging of foods. The drastic increase of <b>additives</b> used in these processes became a serious health concern. The production and distribution of food, instead of being one between local farmers and townspeople, increasingly became a centralized process in large factories. The proliferation of newly discovered chemicals {{and the absence of}} laws moderating their use, made it possible for unscrupulous merchants to use them to boost profits at a cost to the public health. Accum was the first to publicly proclaim the hazards of this practice and to reach a wide audience with his concerns.|$|E

5|$|Some {{table salt}} sold for {{consumption}} contain <b>additives</b> which address {{a variety of}} health concerns, especially in the developing world. The identities and amounts of <b>additives</b> vary widely from country to country. Iodine is an important micronutrient for humans, and a deficiency of the element can cause lowered production of thyroxine (hypothyroidism) and enlargement of the thyroid gland (endemic goitre) in adults or cretinism in children. Iodized salt {{has been used to}} correct these conditions since 1924 and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide, sodium iodide or sodium iodate. A small amount of dextrose may also be added to stabilize the iodine. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people around the world and is the leading preventable cause of mental retardation. Iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of iodine deficiency in countries where it is used.|$|E

This study presents analytical and numerical comparisons of two methods of estimation of <b>additive</b> × <b>additive</b> interaction of QTL effects. In the first method, we observed only the plant phenotype, while in the second method we have additional information from the molecular markers observations. In this study, two data sets were analyzed: i) 150 barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) doubled-haploid lines derived from the cross Steptoe × Morex and ii) 145 doubled-haploid lines of barley obtained from the cross Harrington × TR 306.

50|$|Under {{the same}} {{assumptions}} in <b>additive</b> and dominance QTL mapping of ICIM, an <b>additive</b> by <b>additive</b> epistatic effect between two interacting QTL can be completely {{absorbed by the}} four marker interaction variables between the two pairs of flanking markers 5. That is to say, the coefficients of four marker interactions of two pairs of flanking markers contain the genetic information of the <b>additive</b> by <b>additive</b> epistasis between the two marker intervals. As a consequence, a linear model of phenotype regressing on both markers and marker multiplications can fit the positions and effects of all QTL and their digenic interactions. Similar to the <b>additive</b> QTL mapping of ICIM, two-step strategy was also adopted in <b>additive</b> by <b>additive</b> epistasis mapping. In the first step, stepwise regression was applied to identify the most significant marker and marker interactions. In the second step, two-dimensional scanning was conducted for detecting <b>additive</b> by <b>additive</b> QTL and estimating the genetic effects, based on the phenotypic values adjusted by the regression model in the first step.|$|R
