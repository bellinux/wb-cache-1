50|$|The most {{effective}} <b>air</b> <b>door</b> for containing conditioned air inside a building {{with an open}} door will have a high face velocity at the opening, generated by top-down flow, and air recovery by a recirculating air plenum and duct return to the source fans. This configuration is feasible for new construction, but difficult to implement in existing buildings. The <b>air</b> <b>door</b> is {{most effective}} with low exterior wind velocity; at higher wind velocities, the rate of air mixing increases and the outside air portion of the total face flow increases. Under ideal conditions of zero wind, {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>air</b> <b>door</b> is at its maximum, but in windy locations air doors cannot create a perfect seal, but are often used {{to reduce the amount of}} infiltration from an opening.|$|E
5000|$|The fans in an <b>air</b> <b>door</b> are {{powerful}} enough to provide an air stream to project across the whole doorway opening. Overdoor heaters may have less powerful fans.|$|E
50|$|Airflow {{through a}} door depends on wind forces, {{temperature}} differences (convection), and pressure differences. <b>Air</b> <b>doors</b> work best when the pressure differential between the {{inside and outside of}} the building is as close to neutral as possible. Negative pressures, extreme temperature differences, elevators in close proximity, or extreme humidity can reduce the effectiveness of <b>air</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|KDK {{primarily}} manufactures electric fans, {{although the}} company also manufactures ceiling fans, ventilating fans, range hoods, <b>air</b> <b>doors</b> (<b>air</b> curtains), hand dryers, dehumidifiers, and subterranean air blowers, under the Panasonic brand.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Air</b> <b>doors</b> are {{designed}} to fully cover {{the width of a}} doorway, whereas overdoor heaters may be too narrow.|$|R
5000|$|The {{discharge}} nozzle on an <b>air</b> <b>door</b> is optimized {{to provide a}} uniform air stream across the whole width of the doorway, {{which may not be}} the case with overdoor heaters.|$|E
50|$|An <b>air</b> <b>door</b> or {{air curtain}} is a device {{used to prevent}} air or {{contaminants}} from moving from one open space to another. The most common use is a downward-facing blower fan mounted over an entrance to a building, or an opening between two spaces conditioned at different temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Air {{doors are}} often used where doors are {{required}} to stay open for operational purposes, such as at loading docks and vehicle entrances. They {{can be used to}} help keep flying insects out by creating forceful turbulence, or help keep out outside air, thus reducing infiltration through the opening. Cold drafts can be avoided by mixing in warm air heated by the <b>air</b> <b>door.</b> Heated air doors are commonly used when supplemental heat is needed for a space, and to reduce the wind chill factor inside the opening, in colder climates.|$|E
50|$|KDK, Panasonic's {{manufacturer}} of ventilation {{products such as}} electric fans, range hoods, <b>air</b> <b>doors</b> (<b>air</b> curtains), hand dryers, dehumidifiers and subterranean air blowers, {{became part of the}} Matsushita Conglomerate in 1956. KDK also manufactures all ventilation products sold under the Panasonic name.|$|R
5000|$|... 1965: with Show V, {{immaterial}} sculpture the Dutch artist Marinus Boezem introduced Conceptual Art in the Netherlands. In {{the show}} various <b>air</b> <b>doors</b> are placed {{where people can}} walk through them. People have the sensory experience of warmth, air. Three invisible <b>air</b> <b>doors,</b> which arise as currents of cold and warm are blown into the room, are indicated in the space with bundles of arrows and lines. The articulation of the space which arises {{is the result of}} invisible processes which influence the conduct of persons in that space, and who are included in the system as co-performers.|$|R
50|$|The shows (1964-1969), a {{coherent}} series of drawings, intended as proposals for installations {{which could be}} realized in a museum on order, are characteristic for Boezems early period and illustrate the conceptual nature of his work. The drawings are simple design sketches for exhibition projects, which Boezem stenciled in multiple editions and sent to people in art circles. Typed instructions were enclosed with the drawings. In Show V Boezem does a proposal for an exhibition space. In this show, various <b>air</b> <b>doors</b> are placed where people can walk through them. People here have the experience of warmth, air and cold. The <b>air</b> <b>doors</b> arise as currents of cold and warm are blown in the room.|$|R
5000|$|Because of the {{problems}} posed by the potential escape of air under pressure, the mine engineers erected stout air doors to contain any escaping air and gas and confine possible explosions. One was built within a yard of the face. Isaac Pride who volunteered {{to break through the}} barrier had to work within a very confined space. A blast of air was released as his pick broke through and threw him back against the <b>air</b> <b>door,</b> but he quickly set about enlarging the hole, assisted by [...] "Abby" [...] Dodd.|$|E
5000|$|The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) defines an <b>air</b> <b>door</b> as follows: [...] "In its {{simplest}} application, an {{air curtain}} is a continuous broad stream of air circulated across a doorway of a conditioned space. It reduces penetration of insects and unconditioned air into a conditioned space by forcing an air stream {{over the entire}} entrance. The air stream layer moves with a velocity and angle such that any air that tries to penetrate the curtain is entrained. Air curtain effectiveness in preventing infiltration through an entrance generally ranges from 60 to 80%".|$|E
50|$|A Velocity air meter {{measures}} {{the force of}} air rushing into an engine against a spring-loaded door in an air tunnel. A linear potentiometer rotated along with the hinge of the <b>air</b> <b>door</b> {{measures the}} angle of the opening and sends an electrical signal to the engine control unit (ECU) that changes as the door opens more or less. The ECU can deduce airflow into the engine based on this value after making certain corrections. The problem is that the force against the door is a function of two variables - weight of the air and speed of the air - and the ECU cannot distinguish, for a given door angle, whether the air is less dense but traveling faster or whether the air is denser but traveling more slowly. Therefore air velociy must be corrected for air density (temperature and barometric pressure) in order to reflect air mass (actual number of air molecules entering the engine per unit of time).|$|E
50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>doors</b> can be {{equipped}} with or without heaters to heat the air. The fan must be powerful enough to generate a jet of air that can reach the floor. There are some studies in the scientific literature that present analytical methods to predict the sealing efficiency obtained with an air curtain.|$|R
50|$|All {{accommodation}} bunkers produced {{using the}} standard Regelbau system were protected against gas attack with <b>air</b> tight <b>doors,</b> ventilation and filtration systems.|$|R
50|$|In late 1945 coach 2752 was rebuilt as {{experimental}} air-door trailer 17000, employing {{an unusual}} seating layout with gangways {{on both sides}} of the car. In June 1947 a second experimental unit (20000, converted from 2707) entered service. The <b>air</b> <b>doors</b> were controlled from driving trailer 6727, to which the two were permanently coupled. In 1949 17000 was modified with a conventional centre gangway and renumbered 17001. The two cars were withdrawn in 1953, their work as prototypes for the A60 Stock being completed.|$|R
30|$|Two {{evacuation}} patterns {{affected by}} the ventilation speeds are advanced. The miners located between the <b>air</b> <b>door</b> and the inlet-air end in lane 1 should be evacuated to the inlet-air end, and other miners involved in coal mine fire could select the <b>air</b> <b>door</b> as the evacuating destination, when the ventilation speed is greater than 3  m/s.|$|E
30|$|The parameters, {{including}} the temperature distribution, soot density, CO and heat release rate, are simulated {{to characterize the}} mine fires at different ventilating speeds. The results demonstrate that the conveyor belt burns more vigorously under {{the case of the}} <b>air</b> <b>door</b> opened than that of the <b>air</b> <b>door</b> closed. A miner evacuation model affected by fire smoke movement is advanced, and it is concluded that the miner evacuation behaviors can be divided into three stages.|$|E
30|$|When the {{ventilation}} speed {{is less than}} 3  m/s, the miners in lane 1 should evacuate to the upstream side of the fire scene, and the miners in lane 2 could select either the air intake end or the <b>air</b> <b>door</b> as the evacuation destination.|$|E
50|$|Sparks {{from the}} wooden brake blocks of a haulage engine had {{set fire to}} nearby {{brattice}} sheets. The fire spread quickly, fanned by the strong ventilation and ignited timber supports, sending dense clouds of smoke and fumes into the mine workings. The death toll {{would have been much}} higher {{had it not been for}} the actions of the district fireman, Thomas Prosser. Prosser bravely ventured into the dense smoke and, by opening a set of <b>air</b> <b>doors,</b> diverted the noxious fumes out of the mine.|$|R
5000|$|The Dyson Air Multiplier fans, and the Imperial C2000 {{series range}} hood fans, have no exposed fan blades or other visibly moving parts except their {{oscillating}} and tilting head. The airflow is generated using the Coandă effect; a small quantity of air from a high-pressure-bladed impeller fan, {{contained in the}} base rather than exposed, drives a large airmass via a low-pressure area created by the airfoil. [...] The US Patent & Trademark Office initially ruled that Dyson's patent was not an improvement on the Toshiba patent on a nearly identical bladeless desktop fan granted in 1981.Air curtains and <b>air</b> <b>doors</b> also utilize this effect to help retain warm or cool air within an otherwise exposed area that lacks a cover or <b>door.</b> <b>Air</b> curtains are commonly used on open-face dairy, freezer, and vegetable displays to help retain chilled air within the cabinet using a laminar airflow circulated across the display opening, usually generated by a fan {{in the base of}} the cabinet.|$|R
50|$|B): Towers 3 and 4 {{were built}} in 1947, Towers 5 and 6 (northern-most), in 1947. They have the same brick inner shell and welded-steel outer shell {{construction}} as Towers 1 and 2, but are smaller. All four towers have an outer diameter of 22 ft and are 50 ft tall. The brick liner has an inside diameter of 20 ft and is 33+1/2 ft high. The outer shells are equipped with nozzles for pipe and instrument connections, access <b>doors,</b> <b>air</b> blast <b>doors,</b> gas outlets, and sight holes. The towers rest on concrete pedestals. (Blueprints, 1945-46).|$|R
30|$|When the {{ventilation}} speed {{is greater than}} 3  m/s, the miners located between the measuring point 4 and the inlet-air end in lane 1 should be evacuated to the inlet-air end, and other miners involved in fires could choose the <b>air</b> <b>door</b> as the escaping destination.|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the influence of smoke movement during mine fires on miner evacuation behaviors. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics method was conducted to reconstruct the laneway conveyor belt fire scenes under two ventilating conditions. The parameters, including temperature–time histories, soot density, carbon monoxide and heat release rate, were simulated to characterize the mine fires at various ventilating speeds. A miner evacuation model affected by fire smoke movement was advanced to describe the miner evacuation behaviors, which {{can be divided into}} three stages. Based on the evacuation model coupled with the mine fire smoke movement, the available safety evacuation time for miners involved in coal mine fire located in different sites was estimated. Two evacuation patterns were advanced according to the ventilating speeds combined with the model of miner evacuation behaviors. The results show that the miners located between the inlet-air end and the <b>air</b> <b>door</b> in lane 1 should be evacuated to the inlet-air end and other miners involved in coal mine fire could choose the <b>air</b> <b>door</b> as the escaping destination, when the ventilation speed is greater than 3  m/s. Accordingly, the research can be used as references for the mine safety administration authorities to design the safety evacuation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aiming at the {{badly needed}} goal of energy saving, the {{retrofit}} is implemented by adopting the stepless speed regulation of motor driving by the high-voltage inverter {{to regulate the}} air quantity. The inverter is taken its character of easy manipulation, small maintenance, high control precision as the advantage to replace the traditional device like <b>air</b> <b>door</b> operated and wind deflector operated methods. Furthermore, the feasibility analysis for the energy-saving effect after retrofit will be conducted. It has been concluded that there are obvious improvements both in energy saving and operational stability after the frequency conversion retrofit on the machine...|$|E

50|$|Air {{entered the}} fan through the central eye and exited through the rim. These fans were thus all suction devices, extracting air from a mine and {{releasing}} {{it to the}} atmosphere. A typical installation comprised a pit head building, usually built of stone at this period, with a fan engine house alongside it. The fan was mounted high in {{the gap between the}} buildings, with a connection into the pithead through a circular window in the building and into the eye of the fan. The pithead was made airtight against its reduced internal pressure by shuttered windows and close-fitting doors. If the same building was also used for winding - the lowering and raising of men and equipment - the winding gear could be mounted in the clear space above the shaft, without interfering with the fan arrangements. Mine cages and trams passed through the usual self-closing <b>air</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
