40|$|The {{paper will}} {{first of all}} {{describe}} the history and the present situation of FCPs in Italy, with special focus on the Alpine areas. Then, it will present the preliminary results of {{a recent survey of}} existing FCPs in the Veneto Region, mostly focused on the property structure and of the land and resource uses by the right-holders community. Finally, it will discuss some recent challenges that these well-rooted traditional institutions have to face today, when dealing with new global policy arenas, emerging demands and policy tools to foster sustainable management of natural resources. We argue that the traditional tools which the communities have given themselves to manage their resources might be today not always sufficient to adapt to external change and disturbances, thus sometime leading to non resilient social-ecological systems. We support this claim through examples of conflicts recently occurred in the decision-making process of some <b>Alpine</b> <b>common</b> properties...|$|E
40|$|Lichens are {{observed}} to decline when shrub covers increases {{due to global}} warming and reduced grazing in alpine and arctic areas. However, lichens are still prominent in many mountain habitats where they cover large areas. This may be due to; a) their growth structure that might inhibit vascular plant recruitment (physical structure), b) their production of secondary metabolites that may inhibit germination of vascular plants (allelopathy), or c) their ability to grow in harsh environments unsuitable for vascular plants (low environmental requirement and high stress tolerance). We sowed seeds of 12 species in an <b>alpine</b> <b>common</b> garden experiment with different species of lichen cover. We also tested the chemical effects of the lichens on germination of the species in a growth chamber experiment. Our results show that lichens promote rather than inhibit vascular plants in their early life stages. Seedling emergence was higher within the lichen cover than on bare soil for all lichen species. Except for Cladonia stellaris the biomass of the seedlings was in general higher within the lichens compared to the seedlings on bare soil. The physical structure of C. stellaris cushions seems to inhibit {{the establishment of the}} vascular plant seedlings. Whereas thickness of the lichen cover in general affected the microclimate important for the seedling establishment, it could not explain the variation in soil moisture underneath the lichens. Although an overall strong effect of allelopathy could not be seen on seed germination in the lab experiment, the chemical structure of the lichens had species-specific effects on the plant species. Altogether, the physical structure of the lichens seems to be more important than the chemical structure for seedling emergence in field...|$|E
40|$|How does law {{affect the}} {{resilience}} of common-pool resources? To answer this question this paper adopts an institutionalist perspective on law, arguing that this shares many similarities with the approach of some legal pluralist scholars, i. e., the recognition that a social-ecological system is influenced by a plurality of legal orders having - to borrow Santos terminology - porous qualities. Studying the production and types of relationships between these legal orders can help us in determining whether a system {{is or is not}} likely to be resilient. More precisely, if the legal orders interact in a harmonious and dynamic way thanks to bottom-up as well as top-down forces, the system is likely to be resilient. This theoretical hypothesis is tested in a case study, i. e., an <b>alpine</b> <b>common</b> property in northern Italy called Regole d'Ampezzo. It becomes clear that its resilience to various shocks is due to the harmonic integration and adjustments of customary, property, and environmental laws. However, the completeness of this type of analysis is put under discussion when we move from the macro-institutional level to the micro-political one, i. e., to an analysis of intra-community power relations. Drawing on the work of Foucault on the power-subject nexus, the paper attempts to show that in the specific context of the Regole, the harmonic legal pluralist orders operate as a technique of government, perpetuating certain relationships of power between the actors of the common pool resource. At the same time, the relationships of power also contain the possibility of their reversal since, following Foucault, exercising power means acting on the actions of free subjects. The general conclusion is that a legal study of {{the resilience of}} common pool resources can benefit from a politicized version of legal pluralism...|$|E

40|$|In June 2004 and June 2005, {{we checked}} 40 and 134 ponds {{respectively}} for alive and dead <b>alpine</b> newts, <b>common</b> toads, common frogs, and their clutches on the "Kirchfeld" plateau in the Northern Limestone Alps of Austria. We found several hundred dead <b>common</b> frogs and <b>alpine</b> newts {{in the two}} consecutive years and also observed an unusually high number of heterospecific matings between common toads and common frogs in 2004. In order to test whether the observed mortalities were caused by disease, we screened 98 individuals of the three species for chytridiomycosis, a highly infective fungal disease, in 2008. All samples proved to be negative. We therefore assume that the high losses for the common frog population (26 % in 2004 and 9 % in 2005) during the spring migration, {{as well as the}} breakdown of the temporal premating isolation between the common frog and common toad, were caused by temperature anomalies alone, i. e. sudden low temperatures after a warm spring period. The high number of dead alpine newts found in 2005 was negatively correlated to the oxygen saturation of the ponds, frequently covered by ice during the early breeding season. We discuss the possible effects of climate change on phenological timing, breeding isolation and chytridiomycosis in alpine amphibian populations...|$|R
50|$|There are a {{considerable}} number of alpine species in the mountains in Norway; these will not tolerate summers that are comparatively long and warm or can not compete with plants adapted to a longer and warmer growing season; many <b>alpine</b> plants are <b>common</b> in the North Boreal zone and some in the Middle Boreal zone, but their main area of distribution is on the alpine tundra in the Scandinavian mountains and on the Arctic tundra. Many of the most hardy species have adapted by using more than one summer to ripen seeds. Examples of alpine species are glacier buttercup, Draba lactea and Salix herbacea. A well-known anomaly is the 30 American alpine species, which in Europe only grow in two mountainous parts of Norway; the Dovre-Trollheimen and Jotunheim mountains in the south and the Saltdal to western Finnmark in the north (Gjærevoll, 1992, pp 146-160; Moen, 1998, p 52). Other than in Norway, these species grow only in Canada and Greenland, such as the Braya linearis and Carex scirpoidea. It is unknown whether these survived the ice age on some mountain peak penetrating the ice, or they spread from further south in Europe, or why did they not spread to other mountainous regions of Europe. Some alpine species have a wider distribution and also grow in Siberia, such as the Rhododendron lapponicum (Lapland rosebay). Other <b>alpine</b> species are <b>common</b> in the whole Arctic, some only grows in Europe, such as globe-flower.The following vegetation zones in Norway are all based on botanical criteria (Moen, 1998; Gjærevoll 1992), although, as mentioned, some plants will have specific demands. Forests, bogs and wetlands, as well as heaths, are all included in the different vegetation zones; a South Boreal bog will differ from a North Boreal bog, although some plant species might occur on both.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{tree species}} include {{lodgepole}} pine, Engelmann spruce, Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, aspen and whitebark pine. Willows, grasses and sagebrush are {{found on the}} lower altitudes, while above the timberline <b>alpine</b> meadows are <b>common.</b> Threatened and endangered species found within the forest boundaries include grizzly bears, wolf, black-footed ferret and peregrine falcon. Most of the mammals {{that existed in the}} region prior to European settlement can still be found here. Elk, moose, mule deer, bighorn sheep, bison, coyote, marmot, pronghorn, and cougar are {{but a few of the}} 75 species of mammals known to exist in the forest. Four subspecies of cutthroat trout also are found here including the Snake River cutthroat trout. 355 species of birds have been sighted including bald eagles, trumpeter swans, sandhill cranes, hawks, and Clark's nutcrackers.|$|R
40|$|Shifts in the {{geographic}} range towards higher altitudes are anticipated for many species in south-eastern Australia {{in response to}} future climate warming. This is particularly {{the case for the}} Snowy Mountains, where a substantial reduction in the snow cover is expected to {{have a major impact on}} the distribution of species. A number of large marsupial herbivores occur at lower subalpine elevations, and a shift in their distribution to higher altitudes due to climate change will result in increased grazing of the vegetation of the <b>alpine</b> area. <b>Common</b> wombats Vombatus ursinus were chosen as a model species for examining range shifts because they are common in subalpine areas, but rarely occur above the tree line in the alpine zone. Changes in wombat habitat over time were predicted using a rule-based modelling approach that incorporates resources important to wombats as well as changes in snow depth with climate change. These models predicted a 16 % increase in the area of suitable wombat habitat across the study area by 2050. This increase was largely within higher subalpine altitudes. Thus, shifts in wombat distribution in the Snowy Mountains with climate change are likely to occur at higher subalpine altitudes as a filling process within the extent of occurrence, rather than an expansion beyond the range boundary into the alpine zone...|$|R
50|$|After World War II, the Alps {{entered a}} new phase. At {{one and the same}} time, {{regional}} identities were reinforced and a <b>common</b> <b>Alpine</b> identity was constructed. A remarkable step was made in 1991 with the signing of the Alpine Convention between all Alpine countries and the European Union. This process was strengthened by the appearance of a new set of cultural values for the Alps. In the nineteenth century, there had been a tension between the romantic advocates of the “sacredness” of the Alpine peaks (such as John Ruskin), and modern mountain climbers (such as Leslie Stephen), who promoted the notion of the Alps as the “playground of Europe.” In the twentieth century, the mountains acquired a clearly positive, iconic, status as places unsullied by undesirable urban influences such as pollution, noise and so on.|$|R
