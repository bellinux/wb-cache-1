30|$|The {{measured}} <b>average</b> <b>consumptions</b> are: 8.23  l/ 100  km for Hybrid, 9.95  l/ 100  km for IMA and 12.66  l/ 100  km for 2000. The <b>averages</b> <b>consumption</b> of IMA and 2000 {{are different}} from Hybrid’s one with a statistical significance (measured doing the t-Student tests) higher than 99 %; while the measured <b>average</b> <b>consumptions</b> of IMA and 2000 differ with a statistical significance of 92 %. In percent IMA consumes 21 % more fuel than Hybrid, and 2000 54 % more than Hybrid. Such differences show how hybrid vehicles tend to consume less than conventional vehicles and Hybrid, the hybrid vehicle of the latest generation which features a more powerful electric motor and a continuously variable transmission, performs better than older IMA.|$|R

25|$|Based on an <b>average</b> <b>consumption</b> of 5 {{cubic meters}} of free water per {{household}} and month, an estimated 8 million beneficiary households, and an estimated water supply cost of 4 Rand per cubic meter, the annual cost of the policy can be estimated at 2bn Rand (USD 280m). This corresponds to about 0.1% of GDP in 2011, or about 0.25% of government expenditures. Another estimate puts the cost of free basic water at 5.84 Rand per capita per month, which corresponds to 2.2bn Rand per year.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe use {{of power}} control (PC) and {{discontinuous}} transmission (DTx) can reduce the <b>average</b> power <b>consumption</b> of mobile base stations (BS). In this paper, the power consumption of a picocell or a femtocell are analyzed in a time division multiple access (TDMA) scenario. The minimization of the power consumption {{is viewed as a}} constrained optimization problem and a closed form of the compromise between transmit power and transmission time which minimizes the <b>average</b> power <b>consumption</b> is found. Moreover, we show that for a base station with a low transmit power and a sufficient power saving during sleep mode, such as picocells and femtocells, the <b>average</b> power <b>consumption</b> is minimum when the service time is minimized. Finally, numerical results show that discontinuous transmission greatly decreases the <b>average</b> power <b>consumption</b> of the base station...|$|R
