25|$|Alpha mounted {{back up at}} 10:50am {{to drive}} back into town and try to assist Bravo Company. This request {{had come from the}} Ops Room and had been worded {{carefully}} so as not to sound like an order; only the commander on the ground could assess whether or not Alpha could be of any use. As they expected, they came under contact with heavy fire almost immediately and they had to de-bus from the DAF truck. An RPG was fired <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck,</b> but was deflected {{just in front of the}} vehicle by an electricity cable.|$|E
25|$|The {{austerity}} program {{started in}} 1981 and the widespread poverty it introduced made the Communist regime very unpopular. The austerity programs {{were met with}} little resistance among Romanians and {{there were only a}} few strikes and labor disputes, of which the Jiu Valley miners' strike of 1977 and the Brașov Rebellion of November 1987 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> manufacturer Steagul Roșu were the most notable. In March 1989 several leading activists of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) criticised Ceaușescu's economic policies in a letter, but shortly thereafter he achieved a significant political victory: Romania paid off its external debt of about US $11 billion several months before the time that even the Romanian dictator expected. However, in months following the announcement austerity and a shortage of goods remained the same as before.|$|E
2500|$|The {{level of}} {{violence}} led to {{a large number of}} arrests. Over the next 20 days, more than 60 picketers were arrested. Odell {{was arrested and charged with}} contempt of court for violating Judge Hoge's injunction. A Scioto Land Company official had approached Odell on the street and brandished a gun in his face. Arrested by the town marshal, the official retaliated by having Odell arrested for [...] "congregating" [...] in violation of the injunction. Odell served 10 days in jail for contempt of court. Pollock, too, was arrested and jailed. When a truckload of strikebreakers attempted to run down a group of pickets, the pickets (led by Pollock) retaliated by hurling stones and bottles <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck.</b> Pollock was charged with unlawful assemblage, inciting to riot, and malicious destruction of property. [...] Pollock's wife and defense lawyers were unlawfully denied access to him for several days. When they finally did see him, sheriff's deputies stood close by to intimidate them and listen in on their privileged conversation.|$|E

2500|$|Less {{than ten}} minutes later, a similar attack {{occurred}} against the barracks of the French 3rd Company of the 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment, 6km away in the Ramlet al Baida area of West Beirut. As the suicide bomber drove his pickup truck toward the [...] "Drakkar" [...] building, French paratroopers began shooting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> and its driver. [...] It is believed that the driver was killed and the truck was immobilized and rolled to stop about fifteen yards from the building. [...] A few moments passed before the truck exploded, bringing down the nine-story building and killing 58 French paratroopers. It is believed that this bomb was detonated by remote control and that, though similarly constructed, it was smaller than and slightly less than half as powerful as the one used against the Marines at the Beirut International Airport. [...] Many of the paratroopers had gathered on their balconies moments earlier {{to see what was}} happening at the airport. [...] It was France's worst military loss since the end of the Algerian War in 1962.|$|E

[Note 5: The blue-peter might-fly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck.</b> The blue-peter is a {{term used}} in the British navy and widely elsewhere; it is a blue flag with a white square {{employed}} often as a signal for sailing.

60|$|On Monday Miss Stokes {{turned up}} as usual, striding beside her team. Her 'whoa!' was {{resonant}} and challenging, {{she looked up}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> as her steeds came to a standstill. Joe had turned aside, and had his face averted from her. She glanced him over--save for his slender succulent tenderness she would have despised him. She sized him up in a steady look. Then she turned to Albert, who was {{looking down at her}} and smiling in his mischievous turn. She knew his aspects by now. She looked straight back at him, though her eyes were hot. He saluted her.|$|E
60|$|There {{was plenty}} {{of life in the}} little goods-yard: three porter youths, a continual come and go of farm wagons {{bringing}} hay, wagons with timber from the woods, coal carts loading <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>trucks.</b> <b>The</b> black coal seemed to make the place sleepier, hotter. Round the big white gate the station-master's children played and his white chickens walked, whilst the stationmaster himself, a young man getting too fat, helped his wife to peg out the washing on the clothes line in the meadow.|$|R

50|$|His {{first job}} {{was working for}} his uncle in his sawmill so that the family could survive. After a brief time in the US Army, Hunt spent the 1950s as a lumber salesman, auctioneer, and truck driver before {{starting}} a rice hulls business with his wife Johnelle in 1961. Unfortunately his first attempt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>trucking</b> business was not a success. He lost roughly $19,000. He returned to <b>the</b> <b>trucking</b> industry in 1969, with five tractors and seven trailers.|$|R
6000|$|However, I worked {{five hours}} on the brute, and {{finished}} my Letter all the same, and couldn't sleep last night by consequence. Haven't had a bad night since I don't know when; dreamed a large, handsome man (a New Orleans planter) had insulted my wife, and, do what I pleased, I could not make him fight me; and woke to find it was the eleventh anniversary of my marriage. A letter usually takes me from a week to three days; but I'm sometimes two days on a page - I was once three - and then my friends kick me. C'EST-Y-BETE! [...] I wish letters of that charming quality could be so timed as to arrive when a fellow wasn't working <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> in question; but, of course, that can't be. Did not go down last night. It showered all afternoon, and poured heavy and loud all night.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} last year," [...] said a very gentlemanly-looking officer, {{who might have}} passed for a buck upon town had his skin not been burned to copper in such {{sunshine}} as never bursts upon London--"it was only last year that I brought the old Alexander back from the Mediterranean, floating like an empty barrel and carrying nothing but honour for her cargo. In the Channel we fell in with the frigate Minerva from the Western Ocean, with her lee ports under water and her hatches bursting with the plunder which had been too valuable to trust to the prize crews. She had ingots of silver along her yards and bowsprit, {{and a bit of}} silver plate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> of the masts. My Jacks could have fired into her, and would, too, if they had not been held back. It made them mad to think of all they had done in the south, and then to see this saucy frigate flashing her money before their eyes." ...|$|E
60|$|And yet, {{when one}} comes to think upon it calmly, the {{situation}} of these South American citizens forms only a very pale figure {{for the state of}} ordinary mankind. This world itself, travelling blindly and swiftly in over-crowded space, among a million other worlds travelling blindly and swiftly in contrary directions, may very well come by a knock that would set it into explosion like a penny squib. And what, pathologically looked at, is the human body with all its organs, but a mere bagful of petards? The least of these is as dangerous to the whole economy as the ship's powder- magazine to the ship; and with every breath we breathe, and every meal we eat, we are putting one or more of them in peril. If we clung as devotedly as some philosophers pretend we do to the abstract idea of life, or were half as frightened as they make out we are, for the subversive accident that ends it all, the trumpets might sound by the hour and no one would follow them into battle - the blue-peter might fly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck,</b> but who would climb into a sea-going ship? Think (if these philosophers were right) with what a preparation of spirit we should affront the daily peril of the dinner-table: a deadlier spot than any battle-field in history, where the far greater proportion of our ancestors have miserably left their bones! What woman would ever be lured into marriage, so much more dangerous than the wildest sea? And what would it be to grow old? For, after a certain distance, every step we take in life we find the ice growing thinner below our feet, and all around us and behind us we see our contemporaries going through. By the time a man gets well into the seventies, his continued existence is a mere miracle, and when he lays his old bones in bed for the night, there is an overwhelming probability that he will never see the day. Do the old men mind it, as a matter of fact? Why, no. They were never merrier; they have their grog at night, and tell the raciest stories; they hear of the death of people about their own age, or even younger, not {{as if it was a}} grisly warning, but with a simple childlike pleasure at having outlived some one else; and when a draught might puff them out like a guttering candle, or a bit of a stumble shatter them like so much glass, their old hearts keep sound and unaffrighted, and they go on, bubbling with laughter, through years of man's age compared to which the valley at Balaklava was as safe and peaceful as a village cricket-green on Sunday. It may fairly be questioned (if we look to the peril only) whether it was a much more daring feat for Curtius to plunge into the gulf, than for any old gentleman of ninety to doff his clothes and clamber into bed.|$|E
