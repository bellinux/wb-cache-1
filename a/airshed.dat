50|$|Sulfates in {{solution}} {{in contact with}} concrete can cause chemical changes to the cement, which can cause significant microstructural effects leading to the weakening of the cement binder (chemical sulfate attack). Sulfate solutions can also cause damage to porous cementitious materials through crystallization and recrystallization (salt attack). Sulfates and sulfites are ubiquitous in the natural environment and are present from many sources, including gypsum (calcium sulfate) often present as an additive in 'blended' cements which include fly ash and other sources of sulfate. With the notable exception of barium sulfate, most sulfates are slightly to highly soluble in water. These include acid rain where sulfur dioxide in the <b>airshed</b> is dissolved in rainfall to produce sulfurous acid. In lightning storms, the dioxide is oxidised to trioxide making the residual sulfuric acid in rainfall even more highly acidic. Local government infrastructure is most commonly corroded by sulfate arising from the oxidation of sulfide which occurs when bacteria (for example in sewer mains) reduce the ever-present hydrogen sulfide gas to a film of sulfide (S-) or bi-sulfide (HS-) ions. This reaction is reversible, both readily oxidising on exposure to air or oxygenated stormwater, to produce sulfite or sulfate ions and acidic hydrogen ions in the reaction HS− + H2O+ O2 -> 2H+ + SO4-. The corrosion often present in the crown (top) of concrete sewers is directly attributible to this process - known as crown rot corrosion.|$|E

40|$|Benzene, toluene, {{ethylbenzene}} and xylenes (BTEX) {{are common}} {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) found in urban <b>airsheds.</b> Elevated levels of VOCs {{have been reported in}} many <b>airsheds</b> at many locations, particularly those associated with industrial activity, wood heater use and heavy traffic. Exposure to some VOCs has been associated with health risks. There have been limited investigations into community exposures to BTEX using personal monitoring to elucidate the concentrations to which members of the community may be exposed and the main contributors to that exposure. In this cross sectional study we investigated BTEX exposure of 204 non-smoking, non-occupationally exposed people from four Australian cities. Each participant wore a passive BTEX sampler over 24 h on five consecutive days in both winter and summer and completed an exposure source questionnaire for each season and a diary for each day of monitoring. The geometric mean (GM) and range of daily BTEX concentrations recorded for the study population were benzene 0. 80 (0. 04 – 23. 8 ppb); toluene 2. 83 (0. 03 – 2120 ppb); ethylbenzene 0. 49 (0. 03 – 119 ppb); and xylenes 2. 36 (0. 04 – 697 ppb). A generalised linear model was used to investigate significant risk factors for increased BTEX exposure. Activities and locations found to increase personal exposure included vehicle repair and machinery use, refuelling of motor vehicles, being in an enclosed car park and time spent undertaking arts and crafts.

Although the maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) approach {{used to calculate the}} RAFs has been validated by <b>airshed</b> modeling results for individual organic gases (McNair et al. 1992; ARB 1992), and has been supported by the National Research Council (1991), RAF corrections are sometimes necessary because of differences in spatial and temporal patterns of emissions between motor vehicle fleets (ARB 1992; McNair et al. 1994).

40|$|Given the {{key role}} played by {{biogenic}} volatile organic compounds (BVOC) in tropospheric chemistry and regional air quality, {{it is critical to}} generate accurate BVOC emission inventories. Because oak species found in California often have high BVOC emission rates, and are often of large stature with corresponding large leaf masses, oaks {{may be the most important}} genus of woody plants for BVOC emissions modeling in California <b>airsheds.</b> Accordingly, reference data for leaf mass and leaf area for a stand of native blue oaks were obtained through harvest of 14 trees located in the Sierra Nevada foothills. In addition, leaf mass estimation methods based on a volumetric method and allometric relationships were evaluated for these trees. Leaf mass density (leaf mass per surface area of land) was 310 g m- 2 for the site, but consideration of the surrounding grassland devoid of trees would result in a value of about 150 g m- 2, less than half of reported values for eastern U. S. oak woodlands, but close to a reported value for oaks found in an Italian site, which like California has a Mediterranean climate. The mean value for leaf area index (LAI) for the 14 individual trees at this oak site was 4. 4 m 2 m- 2. LAI for the site was 1. 8 m 2 m- 2, but this value was appropriate for the oak grove only; including the surrounding open grassland would result in an overall LAI value of 0. 9 m 2 m- 2 or less. A volumetric method worked well for estimating the leaf mass of the oak trees. Among allometric relationships investigated, trunk circumference, mean crown radius, and crown projection were well correlated with leaf mass.
