25|$|Limited amateur radio {{operations}} have occurred, using moon bounce or Earth–Moon–Earth communication, in which radio signals {{aimed at the}} Moon are reflected back to Earth. The first of these operations was on June 13–14, 1964, using the call KP4BPZ. A dozen or so two-way contacts were made on 144 and 432MHz. On July 3 and July 24, 1965, KP4BPZ was again activated on 432MHz, making approximately 30 contacts on 432MHz during the limited time slots available. For these tests, a very wide-band instrumentation recorder captured {{a large segment of}} the receiving bandwidth, enabling later verification of other <b>amateur</b> <b>station</b> callsigns. These were not two-way contacts. From April 16–18, 2010, again, the Arecibo Amateur Radio Club KP4AO conducted moon-bounce activity using the antenna.|$|E

Most accounts of Doubleday-Hill's earliest activities say that the initial broadcasts were transmitted using a Special <b>Amateur</b> <b>station</b> authorization, 8ZAE, issued to Burton P. Williams, a company employee living in Pittsburgh. (Contemporary information about licensed stations suggests that 8ZAE didn't receive its first license until late 1921, although it also reports that Williams previously held a license for a standard <b>amateur</b> <b>station,</b> 8EN.) ...|$|E
