5|$|Initial {{development}} {{began in}} November 2008 when Urban Squall met in San Diego for their annual meeting, 2008's theme was 'a {{game in a}} week'. The team consisted of designer and programmer Andrew Pellerano, programmer Panayoti Haritatos, graphic designer Tim Wendorf and musician Nick Esposito. The developers hired two adjoining hotel rooms and opened the connecting door, allowing them to concentrate solely on creating the game {{over a period of}} five days, resulting in a demo. Pellerano spent further weeks updating the game during his spare time after which it was released to the public. During the weeks between the initial demo version and the game's release, Wendorf playtested the game and provided feedback on the number of souls needed to allow special <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> activated. The music track was created one night when Pellerano met Esposito in the latter's studio, during which Pellerano also voiced the sound effects resulting from Cuties being killed.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy X-2 reintroduces the series' classic {{character}} class system (seen previously in Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy Tactics) through {{the inclusion of}} dresspheres. Because the party never grows beyond three characters, switching characters during battle is unnecessary. Instead, the player can switch {{character class}}es, providing access to different abilities. The playable characters are allowed to equip one dressphere at a time, each providing different battle functions and abilities. Characters can learn new skills for each dressphere {{with the use of}} Ability Points (AP). AP is obtained by defeating enemies and by the use of items and abilities for that sphere. <b>Abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> learned are chosen in the main menu. During battle, AP is given to that ability until it is learned. Each character can access as many as six dresspheres at a time, depending on the specific properties of the Garment Grid they are wearing. The Garment Grid is a placard featuring a geometric shape connected by nodes. These nodes are slots that can be filled with dresspheres, allowing characters to change character classes during their turn in battle. Most Garment Grids possess Gates that when passed through grant the user a complimentary buff.|$|E

5|$|The combat of {{the game}} borrows {{multiple}} elements from Naughty Dog's Uncharted series, with players having the ability to free-aim Lara's bow and the guns she salvages, engage in close-quarter combat and perform stealth kills. Players can also use Survival Instinct, an ability in which enemies, collectables and objects pivotal to environmental puzzles will be highlighted for players. The game also incorporates RPG elements: as players progress through the game, they earn experience points from performing certain actions and completing in-game challenges linked with hunting, exploring and combat: this enables players' skills and <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> upgraded in specific ways, such as giving her more storage capacity for arrows and ammunition. Players can also upgrade and customize weapons using salvage collected across the island. There is also a character progression mechanic in the game: better items, weapons and equipment are gained as players progress, though the appearance of most of these items is closely linked to events in the story. In addition to the main story, players can complete multiple side quests, explore the island, revisit locations, and search for challenge tombs.|$|E

Ted Brautigan and Dinky Earnshaw assist the gunslingers with information and weapons, and reunite Roland with his old friend Sheemie Ruiz from Mejis. The Gunslingers free the Breakers from their captors, but Eddie is wounded after the battle and dies a short while later. Roland and Jake pause to mourn and then jump to Maine of 1999 along with Oy, {{in order to save}} the life of Stephen King (whom he writes to be an omniscient secondary character in the book); the ka-tet have come to believe that the success of their quest depends on King surviving to write about it through his books.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, President Eisenhower {{nominated}} a recovered Luce {{to be the}} US Ambassador to Brazil. She {{began to}} learn enough of the Portuguese language {{in preparation for the}} job, but she was by now so conservative that her appointment met with strong opposition from a small number of Democratic senators. Leading the charge was Oregon Senator Wayne Morse. Still, Luce was confirmed by a 79 to 11 vote. Her husband urged her to decline the appointment, noting that {{it would be difficult for}} her to work with Morse, who chaired the Senate Subcommittee on Latin American Affairs. Luce eventually sent Eisenhower a letter explaining that she felt that the controversy surrounding her appointment would hinder her <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> respected by both her Brazilian and US coworkers and resigned from her position as ambassador. She had served only four days, from April 28 to May 1, 1959, and she had never left American soil.|$|E

40|$|Most {{philosophers}} {{believe that}} humans have far greater moral worth than nonhuman animals. This consensus position invites the following question: What characteristic {{or group of}} characteristics of human beings differentiates us from nonhuman animals {{so that we have}} greater moral worth than nonhuman animals? Philosophers have offered a number of characteristics that allegedly show human beings <b>to</b> <b>be</b> superior <b>to</b> nonhuman animals. At {{the top of the list}} we find thinking and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rational. Further down the list we find more subtle abilities, for example, such as the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> self- conscious. Neither of these nor a host of other prospects provide an adequate ground for the claim of greater human worth. 1 But philosophers attribute one <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> humans, or to most humans, that seems immune to the usual criticisms: the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moral. In this essay I want to explore whether the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moral plausibly makes humans more valuable than nonhuman animals...|$|R

500|$|Plath's semi-autobiographical novel, {{which her}} mother wished to block, was {{published}} in 1963 and in the US in 1971. Describing the compilation of the book to her mother, she wrote, [...] "What I've done is to throw together events from my own life, fictionalising to add colour– it's a pot boiler really, but I think it will show how isolated a person feels when he is suffering a breakdown.... I've tried to picture my world {{and the people in}} it as seen through the distorting lens of a bell jar". She described her novel as [...] "an autobiographical apprentice work which I had to write in order to free myself from the past". She dated a Yale senior named Dick Norton during her junior year. Norton, upon whom the character of Buddy in The Bell Jar is based, contracted tuberculosis and was treated at the Ray Brook Sanatorium near Saranac Lake. While visiting Norton, Plath broke her leg skiing, an incident that was fictionalized in the novel. Plath also used the novel to highlight the issue of women in the workforce during the 1950s. She strongly believed in their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> writers and editors, while society forced them to fulfill secretarial roles.|$|E

[...] Westbrook wrote that [...] "Echoing such a popular predecessor as Shrek {{is not a good}} thing– especially when the echo is so faint." [...] Berardinelli felt that the fairy tale references were not as smartly done as in the first Shrek film, while Bernard felt that Hoodwinked! took fairy tale revisionism too far. He felt that the humor in Shrek worked due to the fairy tale characters remaining in character throughout the film, and wrote, [...] "It's pointless to scold them for behaving the way fairy tales intended, and that's far funnier than turning them into breakdancing anachronisms." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic, considered Red's kung fu <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> overly similar to Princess Fiona's [...] "Matrix agility." [...] Gleiberman also noted the similarities between the film and Shrek, but he was positive in the comparison, feeling that its independent production gave the filmmakers [...] "the freedom to follow their flakiest corkscrew whims." [...] While Wilmington did not find Hoodwinked! as impressive or beguiling as Shrek, he wrote that [...] "when it's cooking, it does make you laugh." ...|$|E

[...] When the officials Xue Yuanchao, Pei Yan, and Gao Zhizhou were put in charge of investigations, they discovered a number of armors in Li Xian's palace.

60|$|Friday, July 28th.--Saw my classmate and {{formerly}} intimate friend, ------, for {{the first}} time since we graduated. He has met with good success in life, in spite of circumstance, having struggled upward against bitter opposition, by the force of his own <b>abilities,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a member of Congress, after having been for some time the leader of his party in the State Legislature. We met like old friends, and conversed almost as freely as we used to do in college days, twelve years ago and more. He is a singular person, shrewd, crafty, insinuating, with wonderful tact, seizing on each man by his manageable point, and using him for his own purpose, often without the man's suspecting that he is made a tool of; and yet, artificial as his character would seem to be, his conversation, at least to myself, was full of natural feeling, the expression of which can hardly be mistaken, and his revelations with regard to himself had really a great deal of frankness. He spoke of his ambition, of the obstacles which he had encountered, of the means by which he had overcome them, imputing great efficacy to his personal intercourse with people, and his study of their characters; then of his course as a member of the Legislature and Speaker, and his style of speaking and its effects; of the dishonorable things which had been imputed to him, and in what manner he had repelled the charges. In short, he would seem to have opened himself very freely as to his public life. Then, as to his private affairs, he spoke of his marriage, of his wife, his children, and told me, with tears in his eyes, of the death of a dear little girl, and how it affected him, and how impossible it had been for him to believe that she was really to die. A man of the most open nature might well have been more reserved to a friend, after twelve years' separation, than ------ was to me. Nevertheless, he is really a crafty man, concealing, like a murder-secret, anything that it is not good for him to have known. He by no means feigns the good-feeling that he professes, nor is there anything affected in the frankness of his conversation; and it is this that makes him so very fascinating. There is such a quantity of truth and kindliness and warm affections, that a man's heart opens to him, in spite of himself. He deceives by truth. And not only is he crafty, but, when occasion demands, bold and fierce as a tiger, determined, and even straightforward and undisguised in his measures,--a daring fellow as well as a sly one. Yet, notwithstanding his consummate art, the general estimate of his character seems to be pretty just. Hardly anybody, probably, thinks him better than he is, and many think him worse. Nevertheless, if no overwhelming discovery of rascality be made, he will always possess influence; though I should hardly think that he would take any prominent part in Congress. As to any rascality, I rather believe that he has thought out for himself a much higher system of morality than any natural integrity would have prompted him to adopt; that he has seen the thorough advantage of morality and honesty; and the sentiment of these qualities has now got into his mind and spirit, and pretty well impregnated them. I believe him to be about as honest as the great run of the world, with something even approaching to high-mindedness. His person in some degree accords with his character,--thin and with a thin face, sharp features, sallow, a projecting brow not very high, deep-set eyes, an insinuating smile and look, when he meets you, and is about to address you. I should think that he would do away with this peculiar expression, for it reveals more of himself than can be detected in any other way, in personal intercourse with him. Upon the whole, I have quite a good liking for him, and mean to go to--to see him.|$|E
