5|$|In 1939, a {{magnificent}} ship-burial was discovered under a large mound at Sutton Hoo, in Suffolk. Although Rædwald is usually {{considered to have}} been buried with the ship (or commemorated by it), <b>another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> Eorpwald. Alternatively, he might also have had his own ship-burial nearby.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that a {{gene for}} aposematism might be {{recessive}} and {{located on the}} X chromosome. If so, predators would learn to associate the colour with unpalatability from males with the trait, while heterozygous females carry the trait until it becomes common and predators understand the signal. Well-fed predators might also ignore aposematic morphs, preferring other prey species.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> Fontvieille II Development to {{commence}} in 2013 ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> {{explored}} {{then with}} Aeritalia-Aermacchi, but the financial problems that it crossed the country they made finally abandon the project.|$|R
50|$|The O'Deas, {{together}} with the O'Quinns (Ó Cuinn), belong to the Uí Fearmaic group, {{but it is not}} known if this kindred belongs to the Dál gCais or to the Uí Fidgenti. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>are</b> the Corcu Baiscind.|$|R
5|$|Anthropologists {{speculate}} that the functional significance of long head hair may be adornment, a by-product of secondary natural selection once other androgenic/somatic hair (body hair) had largely been lost. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that long head hair {{is a result of}} Fisherian runaway sexual selection, where long lustrous hair is a visible marker for a healthy individual. For some groups or individuals, however, short hair is the selected trait.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the attribution to book three was simply incorrect, and Atalante's Ehoie came within the family of Athamas in books one or two. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that she was introduced in the context of her mother's family. Her identity in the Catalogue is unknown, but this hypothesis could allow for Atalanta to appear within the Inachid stemma, following the Danae-Ehoie within the extended family of Belus.|$|E
5|$|New {{morphological}} {{features and}} ultimately new species {{are produced by}} variations in the toolkit, either when genes are expressed in a new pattern, or when toolkit genes acquire additional functions. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> the Neo-Lamarckian theory that epigenetic changes are later consolidated at gene level, something {{that may have been}} important early in the history of multicellular life.|$|E
50|$|One {{theory for}} the cause of the fall was that the quarrymen were annoyed with the tourist visits to the place. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> that it fell due to {{vibrations}} from blasting of the bore in the quarries nearby.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> that Bolesław III Wrymouth and Salomea of Berg had a {{daughter}} named Adelaide who died in infancy (and for this probably not mentioned in sources) whose tomb {{would be in the}} country, and Casimir II named his daughter after her.|$|R
50|$|If DSN support {{could be}} obtained, Doppler {{tracking}} of the Vesta spacecraft's movement {{can be used}} to accurately determine the mass of the encountered bodies. In the other case, <b>another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> considered: releasing a test mass, and observing its movement near the target asteroid.|$|R
5|$|The {{chronology}} {{and circumstances}} surrounding the conclusion of Lǫgmaðr's reign are uncertain. According to one source, he voluntarily resigned the kingship and journeyed to Jerusalem where he died. This account could be evidence that he died on crusade: one possibility is the First Crusade, perhaps in the entourage of Robert II, Duke of Normandy; <b>another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> the so-called Norwegian Crusade, in the entourage of Sigurðr Magnússon, King of Norway. Although one source claims that Lǫgmaðr's trek to the Holy Land was undertaken in remorse for the cruelty he had inflicted upon Haraldr, <b>another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that he was forced into exile instead. Whatever the case, {{it is apparent that}} about a decade after Magnús' death, the Crovan dynasty was restored to the kingship in the person of Lǫgmaðr's youngest brother.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} {{architecture}} of ancient Sri Lanka, vatadages were {{built for the}} protection of small stupas that had an important relic enshrined in them or were built on hallowed ground. If the Polonnaruwa Vatadage is the shrine built by Parakramabahu I, the relic of the tooth of the Buddha would have been enshrined within it. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that the alms bowl used by the Buddha may have been enshrined here. Both these relics were important objects in ancient Sri Lankan culture, and would have made the Polonnaruwa Vatadage {{one of the most significant}} and venerated buildings in the country.|$|E
5|$|Echmarcach mac Ragnaill (died 1064/1065) was a {{dominant}} {{figure in the}} eleventh-century Irish Sea region. At his height, he reigned as king over Dublin, the Isles, and perhaps the Rhinns of Galloway. The precise identity of Echmarcach's father, Ragnall, is uncertain. One possibility is {{that this man was}} one of two eleventh-century rulers of Waterford. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that Echmarcach's father was an early eleventh-century ruler of the Isles. If any of these identifications are correct, Echmarcach may have {{been a member of the}} Uí Ímair kindred.|$|E
50|$|Police {{believed}} that Worledge was lured {{from her bed}} by someone whom she knew and trusted, and had simply left the house via the front door, which had <b>been</b> left unlocked. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> {{that she may have}} been abducted by a prowler known to be in the area at the time.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> {{suggested}} <b>was</b> {{that it was}} a scavenger, {{which is}} what prompte Weithofer to name it [...] "death-eater".|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{proposed}} <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> suicide; however, {{interviews with}} doctors and colleagues {{who knew him}} virtually eliminated this possibility.|$|R
5|$|One {{possibility}} is that Venus has no solid inner core, tidal Love number from Magellan and PVO tracking data |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=23 |issue=14 |pages=1857–1860 |url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1996/96GL01589.shtml |accessdate=12 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512154523/http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1996/96GL01589.shtml |archive-date=12 May 2011 |dead-url=yes |doi=10.1029/96GL01589 |date=1996 |bibcode=1996GeoRL..23.1857K}} or that its core is not cooling, so that the entire liquid part of the core is at approximately the same temperature. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that its core has already completely solidified. The state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration of sulfur, which is unknown at present.|$|E
5|$|The unusually low {{metallicity}} of Vega {{makes it}} a weak Lambda Boötis-type star. However, {{the reason for the}} existence of such chemically peculiar, spectral class A0-F0 stars remains unclear. One possibility is that the chemical peculiarity {{may be the result of}} diffusion or mass loss, although stellar models show that this would normally only occur near the end of a star's hydrogen-burning lifespan. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that the star formed from an interstellar medium of gas and dust that was unusually metal-poor.|$|E
5|$|This shark's {{behavior}} and social structure {{is not well}} understood. In South Africa, white sharks have a dominance hierarchy depending on the size, sex and squatter's rights: Females dominate males, larger sharks dominate smaller sharks, and residents dominate newcomers. When hunting, great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. White sharks rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other white sharks. This suggests that when a great white approaches too closely to another, they react with a warning bite. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that white sharks bite to show their dominance.|$|E
50|$|It can be {{used for}} {{personal}} audio, either to have sounds audible to only one person, or that which a group wants to listen to. The navigation instructions for example are only interesting for the driver in a car, not for the passengers. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>are</b> future applications for true stereo sound, where one ear does not hear what the other is hearing.|$|R
50|$|The PFL was {{planning}} the candidacy of Rio de Janeiro mayor César Maia. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> to appoint the vice-president nominee for PSDB presidential candidate. Maia initially {{said he would}} agree with the latter only if the presidential candidate was José Serra, but later accepted {{the possibility of the}} party appointing a name to run with Geraldo Alckmin, which was eventually senator José Jorge.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> remoter <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} name comes from the Ostrogoths, who had a kingdom {{in what is now}} Austria and {{northern}} Italy.|$|R
5|$|While other spies such as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and Klaus Fuchs {{were caught}} after the war, Koval {{apparently}} went unscrutinized for years. Among the reasons given for his maintained cover was that inter-service politics undermined efforts to perform proper security checks on employees. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that the U.S. government chose scientific ability over clear records and political sympathies. In the 1950s, the FBI investigated his wartime activities and interviewed his former colleagues, leaving {{them with the}} impression that he might have been a spy. The matter was kept confidential for sixty years as the US was afraid of the damage that would result from the exposure of Koval's activities.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that Lǫgmaðr regained {{some form}} of control in the Isles {{following}} Magnús' death, and afterwards joined Sigurðr's expedition to Holy Land {{in the first decade}} of the twelfth century. Whether Sigurðr's undertaking was a planned crusade per se, or merely an eventful and violent pilgrimage, is debatable. The precise chronology of this enterprise is similarly uncertain, although the Norwegian fleet certainly reached England before the end of the first decade of the twelfth century. It may have been at this point, whilst Sigurðr overwintered at the English royal court, that Lǫgmaðr joined up with him. If Lǫgmaðr and Sigurðr indeed rendezvoused in England, this may have been the time when Óláfr, the future King of the Isles, was entrusted to the safekeeping of the English king.|$|E
5|$|Most TBI {{that results}} from blunt trauma occurs within the chest. The most common {{tracheal}} injury is a tear near the carina or in the membranous wall of the trachea. In blunt chest trauma, TBI occurs within 2.5cm of the carina 40–80% of the time. The injury {{is more common in}} the right main bronchus than the left, possibly because the former is near vertebrae, which may injure it. Also, the aorta and other tissues in the mid chest that surround the left main bronchus may protect it. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that people with left main bronchus injuries are more likely to also have other deadly injuries and therefore die before reaching hospital, making them less likely to be included in studies that determine rates of injuries.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the name of Springer Mountain is unclear. One {{possible}} origin was that it was named in honor of William G. Springer, an early settler appointed in 1833 by Governor Wilson Lumpkin to implement legislation to improve conditions for the Indians. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> that Springer Mountain was named for the first Presbyterian minister to be ordained in Georgia, John Springer, who was ordained in 1790.|$|R
50|$|Prémat {{drove the}} third Spyker MF1 Racing {{car at the}} 2006 Chinese Grand Prix. He also had an {{off-season}} test with Champ Car team Mi-Jack Conquest Racing. Prémat had the quickest time in several sessions and stated that he was targeting a ride in Champ Cars for 2007. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> to drive in Formula One with Spyker, {{as one of their}} test drivers, but it did not work out.|$|R
50|$|The {{place of}} Luo's birth and date are a {{controversial}} question. One <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> {{that he was}} from Taiyuan, and lived in the late Yuan Dynasty and early Ming Dynasty by the record of his contemporary, the playwright Jia Zhongming (賈仲明), {{who said that he}} had met him in 1364. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> that he was born in Dongyuan, the province of Shangdong, in about 1280 - 1360. Literary historians suggest other possibilities for his home, also including Hangzhou and Jiangnan.|$|R
5|$|Odaenathus was {{described}} as Roman senator in the undated tomb inscription and Hairan I was mentioned with the same title in the 251 inscription. Scholarly opinions vary on the exact date of Odaenathus' elevation to the position; Gawlikowski and Jean Starcky maintain that the senatorial rank predates the Ras elevation. Udo Hartmann concludes that Odaenathus first became a Ras in the 240s then a senator in 250. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that the senatorial rank and lordship occurred simultaneously; Odaenathus was chosen as a Ras following Gordian's death, then after Philip the Arab concluded a peace with the Persians, the emperor ratified Odaenathus' lordship and admitted him to the senate to guarantee Palmyra's continuous subordination.|$|E
5|$|Some scutes {{contain a}} single pore {{known as an}} {{integumentary}} sense organ. Crocodiles and gharials have these on large parts of their bodies, while alligators and caimans only have them on the head. Their exact function is not fully understood, {{but it has been}} suggested that they may be mechanosensory organs. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that they may produce an oily secretion that prevents mud from adhering to the skin. There are prominent paired integumentary glands in skin folds on the throat, and others in the side walls of the cloaca. Various functions for these have been suggested. They may play a part in communication, as indirect evidence suggest that they secrete pheromones used in courtship or nesting. The skin of crocodilians is tough and can withstand damage from conspecifics, and the immune system is effective enough to heal wounds within a few days.|$|E
5|$|Sunrise was at 6:48am that morning, {{and reports}} of the day record that it was unusually bright. The weather {{conditions}} are not recorded. The route that the English army took to the battlefield is not known precisely. Several roads are possible: one, an old Roman road that ran from Rochester to Hastings has long been favoured because of a large coin hoard found nearby in 1876. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> a Roman road between London and Lewes and then over local tracks to the battlefield. Some accounts of the battle indicate that the Normans advanced from Hastings to the battlefield, but the contemporary account of William of Jumièges places the Normans {{at the site of}} the battle the night before. Most historians incline towards the former view, but M. K. Lawson argues that William of Jumièges's account is correct.|$|E
25|$|The {{paper has}} been criticized for restricting its {{analysis}} to convenience samples of college students, possibly introducing systematic bias by excluding victims so traumatized that they did not go on to attend college. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> that Rind et al.'s conclusions may not be generalizable beyond college populations in general as individuals with a history of CSA were more likely than non-abused individuals to drop out of college after a single semester.|$|R
30|$|<b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> {{could have}} <b>been</b> the {{deviation}} {{of the existing}} drilled well toward easterly direction, covering high-amplitude anomalies.|$|R
50|$|During {{planning}} for its extended missions, various future plans for Cassini were evaluated {{on the basis}} of science return, cost, and time. Some of the options examined include collision with Saturn atmosphere, an icy satellite, or rings; another was departure from Saturn orbit to Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, or a centaur. Other options included leaving it in certain stable orbits around Saturn, or departure to a heliocentric orbit. Each plan requires certain amounts of time and changes in velocity. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> aerobraking into orbit around Titan.|$|R
