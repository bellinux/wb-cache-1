5000|$|Norman Tindale {{thought that}} the Barda were perhaps those {{described}} by William Dampier. Dampier arrived in the privateer Cygnet off this coast on 5 January 1688, and remained there doing repairs until 12 March, This has been identified as, in all probability, Karakatta Bay in King Sound, now One <b>Arm</b> <b>Point.</b> The ancestors of the Baada were thus probably the first native Australian people described by Western explorers. A degree of confirmation of this inference emerged when Toby Metcalfe, a linguist {{who has studied the}} Baada language, suggested that Dampier's report of his encounter with the natives of the bay contained a word which was still recognizable from the Baada lexicon.'At our first coming, before we were acquainted with them or they with us, a company of them who lived on the main came just against our ship, and, standing on a pretty high bank, threatened us with their swords and lances by shaking them at us: at last the captain ordered the drum to be beaten, which was done of a sudden with much vigour, purposely to scare the poor creatures. They hearing the noise ran away {{as fast as they could}} drive; and when they ran away in haste they would cry Gurry, gurry, speaking deep in the throat.' ...|$|E
40|$|The Cooks Brook and Middle <b>Arm</b> <b>Point</b> formations, {{situated}} in Bay of Islands, western Newfoundland mainly consist of deep-water carbonates and shales {{ranging in age}} from middle Cambrian to early Ordovician. Previous studies have shown that these rocks were deposited as a "base-of-slope sediment apron", downslope from a carbonate platform. [...] A total of 143 samples from five sections spanning the Cooks Brook and Middle <b>Arm</b> <b>Point</b> formations were collected for conodonts and other microfossils. Of these, 38 samples yielded identifiable conodonts and 19 samples yielded various types of phosphatic problematica. Systematic study of the conodonts have resulted in the identification of 68 species which are assignable to 36 genera. Three new unnamed genera have been described. [...] The conodont fauna permits the recognition of six standard uppermost Cambrian-lowermost Ordovician conodont zones within the Cooks Brook Formation. These zones are: (i) Proconodontus tenuiserratus Zone, (ii) Proconodontus muelleri Zone, (iii) Eoconodontus Zone, (iv) Cordylodus proavus Zone, (v) Cordylodus angulatus Zone and the (vi) Loxodus bransoni Interval. [...] The conodonts from {{the lower part of the}} Middle <b>Arm</b> <b>Point</b> Formation are assigned to Fauna D of Ethington and Clark (1971) while conodonts from the uppermost Middle <b>Arm</b> <b>Point</b> Formation are assigned to the Prioniodus elegans Zone. [...] Based on the conodont fauna the age of middle and upper Cooks Brook Formation ranges from uppermost Franconian to middle(?) Tremadocian. The Middle <b>Arm</b> <b>Point</b> Formation, on the other hand, ranges in age from middle(?) Tremadocian to lower Arenigian. Within the Cooks Brook Formation, the Cambro-Ordovician Boundary can be placed either at the base of the Cordylodus proavus Zone or at the base of the Cordylodus angulatus Zone. [...] The abundance and distribution of conodonts within the Cooks Brook and Middle <b>Arm</b> <b>Point</b> formations show strong environmental control and suggest that most of these conodonts were benthic or nektobenthic in habit. [...] The phosphatic problematica recovered from the Cooks Brook and Middle <b>Arm</b> <b>Point</b> formations exhibit a variety of morphologies and have been divided into four broad, informal groups, namely (i) phosphatic plates and related microfossils, (ii) spherical microfossils, (iii) tubular microfossils, (iv) miscellaneous microfossils and (v) nauplius-like larvae. This large fauna, most of which is previously undescribed, have been described in detail using open nomenclature. Of the previously described forms, three new types (species?) of Anatolepis Bockelie and Fortey are described and the significance of this type of fossil in the earliest history of vertebrates is discussed. The presence of nauplius-like larvae in the Middle <b>Arm</b> <b>Point</b> Formation is of special interest as this is the first reported find of such fossils in North America.

The main {{aim was to}} understand the role of benthic primary producers in the macrotidal fringing reef and terraced lagoon environments which characterize the Sunday Island Group and are common throughout the Kimberley. Our study was focused on the islands and coastline of the Bardi Jawi Indigenous Protected Area (IPA), encompassing Cygnet Bay, One <b>Arm</b> <b>Point,</b> Jalan (Tallon Island) and Iwany (Sunday Island). Five surveys were conducted between November 2013 to November 2015, with three surveys occurring just prior to the wet season (November 2013, October 2014 and October-November 2015) and two surveys just after the wet season (March 2014 and April 2015).

40|$|The Northern Head {{group is}} an upper Middle Cambrian to Lower Ordovician base-of-slope {{sediment}} apron, deposited downslope from a shallow-water carbonate platform, and now disposed in imbricate thrust slices within the Humber Arm Allochthon, western Newfoundland. The group encompasses the upper Middle Cambrian to upper Tremadoc Cooks Brook Formation {{and the upper}} Tremadoc to middle Arenig Middle <b>Arm</b> <b>Point</b> Formation. The discovery of numerous fossil localities has facilitated the erection of a stratigraphic framework, embodying several correlatable members. These subdivisions reflect a natural change in the depositional style upward, from carbonate to shale-dominated. [...] The Cooks Brook is characterized by abundant platform-derived, gravity-transported carbonate, and hemipelagic black shale, deposited in a deep water, poorly-oxygenated environment. Earliest sediments accumulated at the mouths of submarine canyons but were buried by debris flow conglomerate sheets and carbonate sand turbidites from an active, upslope shallow-water platform margin. [...] Gravity transport of carbonate sharply diminished in earliest Ordovician time but hemipelagic carbonate sedimentation persisted into late Tremadoc time. [...] The change to shale-dominated sediments of the Middle <b>Arm</b> <b>Point</b> reflects a new, low-relief margin upslope. Hemipelagic shale was accompanied by detrital, windblown dolomite and both were reworked by bottom currents. Diminished input of shelf and slope-derived organic carbon, and more vigorous marine circulation, resulted in elevated Eh levels in the depositional environment which are indicated by (1) a pronounced increase in bioturbation, and (2) a new "suboxic" diagenetic regime, distinguished by widespread precipitation of Mn-carbonate and barite, largely within the stability field of hematite. Condensed sedimentation characterizes {{the middle of the}} Middle <b>Arm</b> <b>Point,</b> spanning the Tremadoc/Arenig boundary. Shale deposition continued until the collapsing margin was buried by sandstones of the overlying Eagle Island formation during middle Arenig time. [...] The Northern Head group and contemporaneous Cow Head Group were both part of an active carbonate margin until the Tremadoc. Their depositional and paleoceanographic histories diverged in late Tremadoc time, when a low-relief margin developed upslope from the Northern Head group while active carbonate sedimentation continued upslope from the Cow Head Group. This irregular carbonate margin morphology is suggestive of a basement-related structural juncture separating the two areas...|$|E

Over the last decade a burgeoning array of policy, services and programs have been developed to combat the social and emotional problems in Aboriginal communities. Despite some successes, Aboriginal children and youth consistently demonstrate poorer outcomes than non-Aboriginal youngsters across most domains of living, including health, mental health, education and vocation (Zubrick et al., 2005). While the evidence-base related to problems in Aboriginal communities has expanded, there is a deficit in knowledge about practical and sustainable interventions to build strengths in remote young Aboriginal people and families, to promote youth and community wellbeing. Even less has been done on the ground to assist remote Aboriginal communities to take action in tackling the problems they face (Atkinson, Bridge & Gray, 1999; Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Services Council & Westerman, 2002; National Aboriginal Health Strategy Working Party, 1989). This qualitative participatory action research project conducted in the West Kimberley Western Australia from 2001 to 2004 was in collaboration with agencies based in Broome and the Bardi people of Ardyaloon Community, One <b>Arm</b> <b>Point.</b> The investigation aimed to (1) identify and explain the mental health and social and emotional problems affecting Aboriginal young people and families living in remote communities in the West Kimberley; and (2) identify and describe goals and methods for intervention to promote social and emotional wellbeing and build resilience in young people and communities. The third aim was to feed back and culturally validate the research findings. The overarching goal of this project was to work in partnership with Ardyaloon Community in prioritising community-based solutions to youth problems. An Aboriginal Project Advisory Group was formed to guide the research and several local project assistants were employed to assist with the field work. The project involved three studies. Overall, 32 Broome-based youth, parents and service providers, and 59 Elders, parents, youth and service providers from One <b>Arm</b> <b>Point</b> were involved in interviews and discussion groups. The findings were discussed and validated by 101 agency and community people. The results indicate a number of risk and resilience factors operating across the individual, family, community and socio-political sphere, including cultural and historical factors influencing youth wellbeing. From the findings, a model for community-based mental health promotion intervention was developed to address youth problems and build strengths prioritised by Ardyaloon Community...|$|E
