5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>expect</b> a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give up hope even at the edge of the grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E

500|$|After Lollapalooza, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a worldwide tour, which was supported by Moby. Tensions continued to increase and {{when asked if the}} band hated touring, Cornell said, [...] "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>expect</b> you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E
500|$|The band took a slot on the 1996 Lollapalooza {{tour with}} Metallica, who {{had insisted on}} Soundgarden's {{appearance}} on the tour. After Lollapalooza, the band embarked on a world tour, and already-existing tensions increased during it. When asked whether the band hated touring, Cornell replied: [...] "We really enjoy it to a point, and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>expect</b> you {{to come out and}} play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] At the tour's last stop in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 9, 1997, Shepherd threw his bass into the air in frustration after suffering equipment failure, and then stormed off the stage. The band retreated, with Cornell returning to end the show with a solo encore. On April 9, 1997, the band announced it was disbanding. Thayil said, [...] "It was pretty obvious from everybody's general attitude {{over the course of the}} previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction." [...] Cameron later said that Soundgarden was [...] "eaten up by the business". The band released a greatest hits collection entitled A-Sides on November 4, 1997, composed of 17 songs, including the previously-unreleased [...] "Bleed Together," [...] which had been recorded during the Down on the Upside recording sessions.|$|E

50|$|Again, {{the changes}} {{met with a}} mixed reception, but for {{different}} reasons. For example, the end-users of mathematics studies were at that time mostly in the physical sciences <b>and</b> engineering; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>expected</b> manipulative skill in calculus, rather than more abstract ideas. Some compromises have since been required, given that discrete mathematics is the basic language of computing.|$|R

30|$|A {{protected}} area, {{called the}} Royal Botanic Garden (RBG), {{was set up}} in Tell Ar-Rumman with the specific goal of enhancing the quantity and diversity of native vegetation cover.

They are asking ugly questions among themselves, sir, about what those two words, rent and taxes, mean, and about what that same strange word, freedom, means.

I intended to have dined with Lord Treasurer, but I was told he would be busy: so I dined with Mrs. Van; and at night I sat with Lord Masham till one. Lord Treasurer was there, and chid me for not dining with him: he was in very good humour. I brought home two flasks of burgundy in my chair: I wish MD had them.

[...] "We are waiting anxiously for the sound of his musketry announcing him." [...] I was never in my life to wait for any such sound, but how at that juncture I hung about with privileged Wilky! [...] "We all propose at Hdqrs to take our stores out and ride up to the bank of the river and watch the fight on the other side. We are praying to be relieved here--our men are dying for want of clothing; and when we see Morris Island again we shall utterly rejoice." [...] He writes three days later from headquarters established in a plantation the name of which, {{as well as that of}} the stream, of whatever magnitude, that they had crossed to reach it, happens to be marked by an illegibility quite unprecedented in his splendid script--to the effect of a still intenser evocation (as was then to be felt at any rate) of all the bignesses involved. [...] "Sherman's whole army is in our front, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>expect</b> to move on Charleston at any moment." [...] Sherman's whole army!--it affected me from afar off as a vast epic vision.

60|$|Whether I {{wished to}} oppose {{them in their}} {{aspiration}} for greater freedom, or whether I wished to encourage them, I should begin to answer them {{by saying that the}} Young Girl has never done anything of the kind. The manners of the novel have been improving with those of its readers; that is all. Gentlemen no longer swear or fall drunk under the table, or abduct young ladies and shut them up in lonely country-houses, or so habitually set about the ruin of their neighbors' wives, as they once did. Generally, people now call a spade an agricultural implement; they have not grown decent without having also grown a little squeamish, but they have grown comparatively decent; {{there is no doubt about}} that. They require of a novelist whom they respect unquestionable proof of his seriousness, if he proposes to deal with certain phases of life; they require a sort of scientific decorum. He can no longer expect to be received on the ground of entertainment only; he assumes a higher function, something like that of a physician or a priest, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>expect</b> him to be bound by laws as sacred as those of such professions; they hold him solemnly pledged not to betray them or abuse their confidence. If he will accept the conditions, they give him their confidence, and he may then treat to his greater honor, and not at all to his disadvantage, of such experiences, such relations of men and women as George Eliot treats in 'Adam Bede,' in 'Daniel Deronda,' in 'Romola,' in almost all her books; such as Hawthorne treats in 'The Scarlet Letter;' such as Dickens treats in 'David Copperfield;' such as Thackeray treats in 'Pendennis,' and glances at in every one of his fictions; such as most of the masters of English fiction have at same time treated more or less openly. It is quite false or quite mistaken to suppose that our novels have left untouched these most important realities of life. They have only not made them their stock in trade; they have kept a true perspective in regard to them; they have relegated them in their pictures of life to the space and place they occupy in life itself, as we know it in England and America. They have kept a correct proportion, knowing perfectly well that unless the novel is to be a map, with everything scrupulously laid down in it, a faithful record of life in far the greater extent could be made to the exclusion of guilty love and all its circumstances and consequences.|$|E

I have no doubt of him at all. I think 'tis now passed. And I suppose MD is malicious enough to be glad, and rather have it than Wells.(18) But you see what a condition I am in. I thought I was to pay but six hundred pounds for the house; but the Bishop of Clogher says eight hundred pounds; first-fruits {{one hundred and fifty}} pounds, and so, with patent, a thousand pounds in all; so that I shall not be the better for the deanery these three years.

I carried it with the strongest hand possible. If he does not use me well and gently in what dealings I shall have with him, he will be the most ungrateful of mankind. The Archbishop of York,(22) my mortal enemy, has sent, by a third hand, that he would be glad to see me. Shall I see him, or not? I hope to be over in a month, and that MD, with their raillery, will be mistaken, that I shall make it three years. I will answer oo rettle soon; but no more journals. I shall be very busy. Short letters from hence forward. I shall not part with Laracor. That is all I have to live on, except the deanery be worth more than four hundred pounds a year. Is it? If it be, the overplus shall be divided between MD and FW beside usual allowance of MD.... (23) Pray write to me a good-humoured letter immediately, let it be ever so short.
