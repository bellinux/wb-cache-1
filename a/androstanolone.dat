25|$|Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), or 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT), {{also known}} as <b>androstanolone</b> or stanolone, is an {{endogenous}} androgen sex steroid and hormone. The enzyme 5α-reductase catalyzes the formation of DHT from testosterone in certain tissues including the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, epididymides, skin, hair follicles, liver, and brain. This enzyme mediates reduction of the C4-5 double bond of testosterone. Relative to testosterone, DHT is considerably more potent as an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR).|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; <b>androstanolone,</b> stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Dihydro{{testosterone}} (DHT) (referred to as <b>androstanolone</b> or stanolone {{when used}} medically) {{can also be}} used in place of testosterone as an androgen. The availability of DHT is limited; it is not available in the United States or Canada, for instance, but it is available in certain European countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Belgium, Italy, and Luxembourg. DHT is available in formulations including topical gel, buccal or sublingual tablets, and as esters in oil for intramuscular injection. Relative to testosterone, and similarly to many synthetic AAS, DHT has the potential advantages of not being locally potentiated in so-called androgenic tissues that express 5α-reductase (as DHT is already 5α-reduced) and of not being aromatized into an estrogen (it is not a substrate for aromatase).|$|E
2500|$|DHT is {{available}} in pharmaceutical formulations for medical use as an androgen or anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS). It is used mainly {{in the treatment of}} male hypogonadism.

50|$|<b>Androstanolone</b> {{was under}} {{development}} in a topical formulation {{for the treatment of}} cachexia in cancer patients, and reached phase III clinical trials for this indication, but ultimately was not introduced for this purpose. Although <b>androstanolone</b> itself has not been approved for the treatment of cachexia, an orally active synthetic derivative of <b>androstanolone,</b> oxandrolone (2-oxa-17α-methylandrostanolone), is approved and used for this indication.|$|E
50|$|<b>Androstanolone</b> {{can have}} {{adverse effects on}} the {{cardiovascular}} system, especially with long-term administration of high dosages. AAS like <b>androstanolone</b> stimulate erythropoiesis (red blood cell production) and increase hematocrit levels and at high dosages can cause polycythemia (overproduction of red blood cells), which can greatly {{increase the risk of}} thrombic events such as embolism and stroke. Unlike many other AAS, <b>androstanolone</b> is not aromatized and has no risk of estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia, fluid retention, or edema. In addition, as it is not a 17α-alkylated AAS and is administered parenterally, <b>androstanolone</b> has no risk of hepatotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Androstanolone</b> is {{a potent}} agonist of the AR. It has an {{affinity}} (Kd) of 0.25 to 0.5 nM for the human AR, which is about 2- to 3-fold {{higher than that of}} testosterone (Kd = 0.4 to 1.0 nM) and the dissociation rate of <b>androstanolone</b> from the AR is also about 5-fold slower than that of testosterone. The EC50 of <b>androstanolone</b> for activation of the AR is 0.13 nM, which is about 5-fold stronger than that of testosterone (EC50 = 0.66 nM). In bioassays, <b>androstanolone</b> {{has been found to be}} 2.5- to 10-fold more potent than testosterone.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{testosterone}} {{and various}} other AAS, <b>androstanolone</b> cannot be aromatized, and for this reason, poses no risk of estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia at any dosage. In addition, <b>androstanolone</b> cannot be metabolized by 5α-reductase (as it is already 5α-reduced), and for this reason, is not potentiated in so-called [...] "androgenic" [...] tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland, thereby improving its ratio of anabolic to androgenic effects. However, <b>androstanolone</b> is nonetheless described as a very poor anabolic agent. This is attributed to its high affinity as a substrate for 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD), which is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and inactivates <b>androstanolone</b> into 3α-androstanediol, a metabolite with very weak AR activity. Unlike <b>androstanolone,</b> testosterone is very resistant to metabolism by 3α-HSD, and so is not similarly inactivated in skeletal muscle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{terminal}} half-life of <b>androstanolone</b> in the circulation (53 minutes) {{is longer than}} that of testosterone (34 minutes), and this may account {{for some of the}} difference in their potency. [...] A study of transdermal <b>androstanolone</b> and testosterone treatment reported terminal half-lives of 2.83 hours and 1.29 hours, respectively.|$|E

50|$|<b>Androstanolone,</b> or stanolone, {{also known}} as {{dihydrotestosterone}} (DHT), is a naturally occurring anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and androgen steroid hormone which is used medically {{in the treatment of}} male hypogonadism (androgen deficiency).

50|$|Adverse {{effects of}} <b>androstanolone</b> {{are similar to}} those of other AAS and include {{androgenic}} side effects like oily skin, acne, seborrhea, increased facial/body hair growth, scalp hair loss, and increased aggressiveness and sex drive. In women, <b>androstanolone</b> can cause partially irreversible virilization, for instance voice deepening, hirsutism, clitoromegaly, breast atrophy, and muscle hypertrophy, as well as menstrual disturbances and reversible infertility.
