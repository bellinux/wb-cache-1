They arrived in the Banda area after the Ligbi people, who came from Begho (Bigu, Bighu) to the area in the early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen-year-old Wei Minzhi {{arrives in}} Shuiquan village to {{substitute}} for the village's only teacher (Gao Enman) while he takes a month's leave to care for his ill mother. When Gao discovers that Wei {{does not have a}} high school education and has no special talents, he instructs her to teach by copying his texts onto the board and then making the students copy them into their notebooks; he also tells her not to use more than one piece of chalk per day, because the village is too poor to afford more. Before leaving, he explains to her that many students have recently left school to find work in the cities, and he offers her a 10 yuan bonus if all the students <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>there</b> when he returns.|$|E
5|$|During one of {{the work}} parties, Stanley was sent to build a road and stairs leading to a {{memorial}} to the Japanese dead on Bukit Batok Hill (Marked with a Bukit Batok Memorial plaque today, only the stairs and road called Lorong Sesuai <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>there</b> to be seen). The chaplain of the regiment, well aware of Stanley's religious conviction and artistic background, requested him to decorate the asbestos walls at the altar area of a small open attap-roofed chapel at Bukit Batok. With charcoal salvaged from around the camp, he drew two murals: Nativity, which featured a Malay Madonna and Descent from the Cross in which he included soldiers in uniforms, using his comrades as models. By then, he was becoming ill and was suffering from a severe renal disorder complicated by amoebic dysentery. On 23 May 1942, Stanley was lying comatose and was sent to Roberts Barracks in Changi which was converted {{for use as a}} hospital for POWs to recuperate.|$|E

All other tracks were kept, though the tracks up to Tyholtveien were eventually removed. The tracks in the Rosenborg Loop were never removed, but simply asphalted over, and <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>there</b> today. Sections of the tracks can still be seen where the asphalt is thin.|$|E

From Glenridding a track known as The Rake leads to the eastern col, or the track past the former Greenside Mine leads to Nick Head, the western col. The latter route is no longer the {{industrial}} nightmare that Alfred Wainwright complained of in his 1955 guide-book when the mine was still working, but the spoil heaps and some of the mine buildings <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} after Fatio's death (which {{occurred}} in 1753), Le Sage began trying to acquire Fatio's papers to – according to his own words – rescue them from oblivion, and also for a treatise he planned to write {{on the history of}} theories of gravitation. One of Fatio's papers was sent to Le Sage by Abauzit in 1758, and other papers were acquired by Le Sage in 1766, 1770 and 1785. He also started a biographical note on Fatio, although he did not complete it, and he tried without success to publish some of Fatio's papers. The Geneva manuscripts were deposited in the library of Geneva by Prévost after Le Sage's death and <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E

In 1982 tubewells {{in the vicinity of the}} UCIL factory had to be abandoned and tests in 1989 performed by UCC's laboratory revealed that soil and water samples collected from near the factory and inside the plant were toxic to fish. Several other studies had also shown polluted soil and groundwater in the area. Reported polluting compounds include 1-naphthol, naphthalene, Sevin, tarry residue, mercury, toxic organochlorines, volatile organochlorine compounds, chromium, copper, nickel, lead, hexachloroethane, hexachlorobutadiene, and the pesticide HCH.|$|E
25|$|From {{the head}} of the lock, a {{footpath}} leads to the Weavers Way, a long distance footpath which follows the course of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway at this point. Near the grade II listed railway bridge, constructed in 1881 of steel and brick, a footpath has been constructed around Honing Staithe, which has been cleared and rewatered. The path was formally opened by Norman Lamb, MP for North Norfolk on 28 September 2008. Continuing to the west and then the north west, the canal reaches Briggate Lock, which can be viewed from Briggate Bridge. The mill is to the south of the bridge, while the mill pond and lock are to the north. A little further north, the railway crossed the canal. The brick piers <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>there,</b> but the bridge {{has been replaced by a}} wooden footbridge, which carries the Weavers Way.|$|E
25|$|Poirot {{arrives in}} the middle of the night. They tell him the {{sequence}} of events and their suspicions regarding Mrs. Vanderlyn. Investigating the grass leading off the terrace, Poirot confirms that there are no footprints, which means that someone in the house committed the theft and the papers <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>there.</b> He questions each person in turn. He understands that Leonie saw no ghost; she screamed because Reggie sneaked up on her to snatch a kiss. Poirot suggests to Lord Charles that he end the party so that his guests will leave the house. The next morning the guests begin to leave. Lady Julia believes that her son Reggie stole the plans since he is very short of money and was not in his room for a period the previous evening. She promises Poirot that they will be returned within twelve hours if no further action is taken. Poirot agrees to this and they all depart.|$|E

500|$|From 1872 to 1875 Ricketts and his {{partners}} operated a sawmill [...] southeast of his house. In 1872 Ricketts used lumber from the mill to build a three-story wooden addition about [...] north of the stone house, with a verandah connecting the two. The addition cost $45,000(approximately $ in [...] ), and {{was known as the}} Ark for its resemblance to Noah's Ark. That same year Ricketts put new white birch floors in the stone house, which <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>there</b> as of 2008.|$|E
500|$|There {{was once}} a second similar bandstand (also built in 1935) in the 'music gardens' near the Redoubt Fortress. The bandstand was removed {{to make way for}} the Pavilion Tearooms but the colonnades built around it <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>there</b> (behind the tea rooms). Before 1935 each of these sites had a smaller [...] "birdcage" [...] bandstand; the one in the music gardens having been moved from a rather {{precarious}} position opposite the Albion Hotel. The kiosk in the music gardens was originally one of the toll kiosks at the entrance to the pier.|$|E

[...] The single [...] "Lola" [...] received positive reviews, and, due to its success, an interview with Ray Davies by Jonathan Cott was featured as a cover story for Rolling Stone in November 1970.|$|E

500|$|According to Franklin, the {{selective}} fragments or pseudorealities that become news stories are produced {{to attract and}} hold people's attention {{by focusing on the}} unusual over the usual. She acknowledges that no one is forced to watch television or listen to radio; people can explore other channels of communication. But the pseudorealities created by the media <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>there</b> [...] "and the world is structured to believe in them." [...] She argues that images from afar have taken over much of our everyday reality like an immensely powerful occupation force. [...] "And somewhere, someone will have to ask, 'How come the right to change our mental environment—to change the constructs of our minds and the sounds around us—seems to have been given away without anybody's consent?'" ...|$|E
500|$|A small one-roomed National school (a school {{established}} by the National Society for Promoting Religious Education) {{was built in the}} village in 1872 for about 30 children. However some evidence exists that it had [...] "accommodation for forty-two children and an average attendance of twenty-eight". [...] The school was recorded on maps of the village until 1909, although it was dissolved in 1930 (school mistresses Miss Fanny Harris and Miss Pepper later ran the post office and general store from an outhouse at Flint Cottage). The building that housed the school has since been converted to a private dwelling. The school's small playground was lined by lime trees planted in memory of a general {{at the end of the}} Boer Wars. As of November 2011 the lime trees <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
500|$|Billboard Bill Holland called James and the {{material}} on Blue Gardenia a [...] "near-perfect fit" [...] after noting her [...] "hit-or-miss relationship with standards" [...] in the past. Holland felt that Walton's arrangements were designed for a singer with a [...] "less robust style", but considered [...] "Blue Gardenia" [...] and [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] to be [...] "riveting". Lorraine Ali's review for Newsweek called Blue Gardenia a [...] "smooth cocktail", suggesting that James' vocal performance reflected her difficult past. Dave Nathan of All About Jazz concluded that [...] "James may have slowed a bit {{when it comes to}} technical skills. But the fervency, the soul and the passion not only <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>there,</b> but have grown keener with age. This is an album of more than an hour of from the heart singing by one of the great ones and is recommended." ...|$|E
