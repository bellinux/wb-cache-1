500|$|The {{newspaper}} {{has been}} accused from time-to-time of forcing public figures out of the closet. This policy of 'outing' individuals surfaced in 1996 during {{the debate over the}} Defense of Marriage Act, when the Blade and The Advocate were going to out Congressmen Jim Kolbe and Mark Foley. Neither publication did out either politician, and both publications later denied ever intending to out the Congressmen. In recent years, these accusations have resurfaced as Kevin Naff, current editor of the Blade, has accused the Washington Post of 'straight-washing' stories about LGBT individuals. Naff wrote that [...] "When someone is described as 'flamboyant,' 'eccentric' or 'a lifelong bachelor,' we know what’s being implied... Readers of the Washington Post had better hone their gaydar skills, because in story after story, the newsgathering behemoth either ignores questions of sexual orientation or employs endless winks and nods to convey what would be better spelled out." [...] When asked why identifying and outing of individuals by publications like the Blade, staff writer Greg Marzullo wrote [...] "Why do [...] insist on mentioning someone's sexual orientation at all? Because we're a queer paper." [...] As reported in the Washington Post, former editor Chris Crain summarized the Blades editorial reasoning for the 'outings' by stating that [...] "It is 2004, not 1954, and sexual orientation in and of itself is no longer a 'private fact' beyond the pale of inquiry." [...] The Blade, he wrote, [...] "would investigate and report about whether influential Hill <b>aides</b> <b>are</b> gay if facts about their sexual orientation raise highly newsworthy questions of hypocrisy in the stands taken by anti-gay members of Congress for whom they work." [...] A former staff writer of the Washington Blade has noted objections to this perceived campaign to label individuals by their sexual orientations and has used a blog to register these objections.|$|E

2500|$|Le Canard enchaîné {{continued}} its run of stories on Fillon in its issue of 8 February, revealing that Penelope Fillon collected severance payments totaling €45,000, with €16,000 in August 2002 {{for the period}} 1998–2002 and €29,000 in 2013 for seventeen months of employment for which she earned €65,839. The satirical weekly also asserted that she received a double salary {{during the summer of}} 2002, as she was hired by Joulaud's office on 13 July, more than a month before her contract as a parliamentary assistant with her husband expired, on 21 August. Although <b>aides</b> <b>are</b> eligible to collect severance payments, the law does not permit such a high level for parliamentary assistants. An article in the same issue reported that Marie Fillon was simultaneously employed as a parliamentary assistant while training to become a lawyer, taking the first post in October 2005 and entering the [...] in January 2006. Fillon responded to the claims in a press release by saying that Le Canard enchaîné conflated the amount his wife collected in November 2013 with reported earnings in August 2007 after the conclusion of her work with Joulaud, and denounced the paper's allegations as [...] "lies".|$|E

"We may say here, what we {{have said}} on a {{personal}} alliance: however just the cause of that king may be who is driven from the throne either by his subjects or by a foreign usurper, his <b>aides</b> <b>are</b> not obliged to support an eternal war in his favor. After having made ineffectual efforts to restore him, they must at length give peace to their people, and come to an accommodation with the usurper, and for that purpose treat with him as with a lawful sovereign. Louis the Fourteenth, exhausted by a bloody and unsuccessful war, offered at Gertruydenberg to abandon his grandson, whom he had placed on the throne of Spain; and when affairs had changed their appearance, Charles of Austria, the rival of Philip, saw himself, in his turn, abandoned by his allies. They grew weary of exhausting their states {{in order to give}} him the possession of a crown which they believed to be his due, but which, to all appearance, they should never be able to procure for him."--Book II. ch. xii. §§ 196, 197.|$|E
