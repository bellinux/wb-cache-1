After a few seconds the intensity decreases and reaches a steady-state level. The initial rise of the fluorescence intensity is attributed to the progressive saturation of the reaction centers of photosystem 2 (PSII). Therefore, photochemical quenching increases with the time of illumination, with a corresponding increase of the fluorescence intensity. The slow decrease of the fluorescence intensity at later times is caused, {{in addition to other}} processes, by non-photochemical quenching. Non-photochemical quenching is a protection mechanism in photosynthetic organisms as they have to avoid the adverse effect of excess light.

40|$|The KMnO 4 -Fe(II) {{process was}} proved {{to have good}} {{application}} potential in Microcystis aeruginosa removal, although at relatively high doses. This study aims to improve the algae removal in KMnO 4 -Fe(II) process by moderate prechlorination, which can realize the desorption of surface-adsorbed organic matter (S-AOM) from algae cells without damaging cell integrity. S-AOM was proved to not only inhibit algae removal but also maintain cell integrity, using various dilution methods for <b>algal</b> <b>suspension</b> preparation. The dilution after filtration method mainly removed the dissolved organics in cultured M. aeruginosa, while the dilution after centrifugal cleaning method could also remove the S-AOM on algae cells. Compared with the S-AOM-removed <b>algal</b> <b>suspension,</b> the lower algae removal in KMnO 4 -Fe(II) process and the reduced proportion of damaged cells during prechlorination of <b>algal</b> <b>suspension</b> without S-AOM removed indicated the inhibitory role of S-AOM in algae removal and the protective function of S-AOM toward cell integrity, respectively. Moderate prechlorination of directly diluted M. aeruginosa could be realized at chlorine doses of below 0. 5 mg/L, and the damaged cell ratios were below 4 % after 5 -min prechlorination. The ability of the KMnO 4 -Fe(II) process to remove algae was dramatically enhanced by the elevation of chlorine dose from 0 to 0. 5 mg/L, as more S-AOM was desorbed during prechlorination. Additionally, algae cells were easily captured by flocs after moderate prechlorination, which benefited the floc aggregation for formation of tightly bounded algae flocs. Therefore, the desorption of S-AOM without damaging cell integrity is the key feature of moderate prechlorination, which can be applied in improving the algae removal of KMnO 4 - Fe(II) process.

40|$|As algae-derived biofuel is a {{promising}} renewable energy source, it is well-established that micro-algae {{have the potential}} to make a significant contribution to transportation fuel demand. Although it has many advantages including high areal productivity, there are many negative factors. One of these factors is the predation of algae by amoebas, protozoans, ciliates and rotifers, particularly in open pond systems. For example, the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis, is able to eat as much as 12, 000 algae cells per hour and can be responsible for an entire pond crash within days. Thus, these higher organisms need to be controlled in order to satisfy large-scale algae crop and biofuel production demand. 	One method of predation control involves the introduction of a toxic chemical to an algal culture that the predator has a higher sensitivity to with respect to algae. Ideally, predation could be minimized or eliminated without a substantial effect on the algal culture growth. Chlorella kessleri was used as the algal culture and Brachionus calyciflorus as the source of predation. Research was conducted in five stages. First, chlorine dissipation tests were carried out using spring water, distilled water, Bolds Basal Medium (BBM), and three different dry weights of <b>algal</b> <b>suspension</b> in order to analyze the dissipation rate of the residual chlorine. The results showed that chlorine in distilled water and spring water rarely dissipated while chlorine concentration in <b>algal</b> <b>suspension</b> rapidly decreased by a maximum of 90 % within the second hour. Second, acute chlorine toxicity tests were conducted in order to find the 24 -hr LC 50 of B. calyciflorus. The 24 -hr LC 50 of the test animal was 0. 198 mg Cl/L. Third, chlorine toxicity tests were conducted in order to find the LC 50 of Chlorella kessleri. The 24 -hr LC 50 of C. kessleri was 0. 321 mg Cl/L. Based on these results, the test animal was more sensitive to chlorine than the test algae; therefore chlorine may be used to avoid algae pond crashes by B. calyciflorus. Fourth, C. kessleri and B. calyciflorus were combined into one test to determine {{how long it would take}} to observe an algal culture crash. The result demonstrated that the higher the population of predators in <b>algal</b> <b>suspension,</b> the faster it crashed. Finally, chlorine, C. kessleri, and B. calyciflorus were combined into one test to determine what chlorine concentration and dosing interval was needed to significantly reduce predation without significantly reducing algae growth. The results of the fifth experiment showed that the effective intermittent chlorine concentration was between 0. 45 and 0. 60 mg Cl/L, and a short interval of chlorine dosing was effective in inhibiting rotifers in <b>algal</b> <b>suspension.</b> Even though the rotifers in <b>algal</b> <b>suspension</b> were inhibited by 0. 45 to 0. 60 mg Cl/L, algae growth was greatly inhibited by chlorine.

The pulse amplitude-modulated chlorophyll fluorometer (PAM 101 Chlorophyll Fluorometer, Heinz Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) and saturating pulse technique have frequently been used in measuring Fo and Fm and in resolving the contributions of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching to the total fluorescence yield. The extent to which instrument-dependent factors may affect the accurate measurement of Fo and Fm is addressed. It is shown {{that the increase in}} pulse amplitude-modulated measuring beam intensity at 1. 6 and 100 kHz was nonlinear at higher light intensity settings. The implications of this for {{measurements of}} Fo (1. 6 kHz) and Fm (100 kHz) are discussed.

40|$|The prechlorination-induced algal {{organic matter}} (AOM) {{released}} from Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) cells {{has been reported}} to serve as a source of precursors for chlorinated disinfection byproducts (DBPs). However, previous studies have mainly focused on the precursors either extracted directly from the cell suspension or derived immediately after <b>algal</b> <b>suspension</b> prechlorination. This study aims to investigate the impacts of water transportation time after <b>algal</b> <b>suspension</b> prechlorination on cell integrity, AOM release, and DBP formation during the dissolved phase chlorination. The damage to cell integrity after prechlorination was indicated to depend not only on chlorine dose but also on transportation time. The highest dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) values were observed at 2 mg/L chlorine preoxidation before transportation, but were obtained at 0. 4 mg/L chlorine after 480 -min simulated transportation. The variation of DON with transportation time was indicated to be mainly influenced by the small molecular weight nitrogenous organic compounds, such as amino acids. Additionally, formation of the corresponding chlorinated carbonaceous disinfection byproducts (C-DBPs) and nitrogenous disinfection byproducts (N-DBPs) during the dissolved phase chlorination showed the same variation tendency as DOC and DON respectively. The highest C-DBP (98. 4 mu g/L) and N-DBP (5. 5 mu g/L) values were obtained at 0. 4 mg/L chlorine preoxidation after 480 -min simulated transportation. Therefore, when prechlorination is applied for algae-laden water pretreatment, not only chlorine dose but also transportation time needs to be considered with regard to their effects on cell integrity, AOM release, and chlorinated DBP formation.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} in the last decennia to develop a rapid method for lipid determination in microalgae, as an alternative for the time consuming gravimetric methods. Different studies showed that in situ lipid staining with Nile Red is a promising method, but very few did a profound optimization and validation. In this study, lipid determination with in situ staining of lipids with Nile Red has therefore been thoroughly optimized and validated for Nannochloropsis oculata. It was found that fluorescence intensity at 570 - 580 nm (when excitation wavelength was 486 nm) increased in microalgal suspensions with Nile Red compared to the blank without Nile Red, suggesting that Nile Red enters the microalgal cells and stains the lipids. Fluorescence intensity, calculated by peak height or peak area, was increased by addition of glycerol to the microalgal suspension. This method was further improved by optimization of the optical density of the <b>algal</b> <b>suspension,</b> the Nile Red concentration and glycerol concentration in the <b>algal</b> <b>suspension</b> and the incubation time. This optimized procedure was used to validate the method. In contrast to almost all studies about this subject, the validation was performed on different, independent batches of Nannochloropsis oculata, on which both the Nile Red method and the gravimetric method was tested. A good correlation (R² = 0. 9483) was found between neutral lipid content obtained by the Nile Red method and the gravimetric method. It can also be concluded that Nile Red staining correlates better with neutral lipid content than with total lipid content. It can be concluded that Nile Red in situ lipid staining gives an indication of the (neutral) lipid content in Nannochloropsis oculata. Also for other microalgal species, this is a promising method.

Leaf extracts from eucalyptus have greater amounts of phenolics and flavonoids, as well as greater ferric reducing antioxidant potential than elderberry.

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) and process simulation are important tools {{for the design}} and optimisation of biochemical processes. In this contribution, the photobioreactor design methodology based on CFD is proposed. A widely used CFD package (Fluent 6. 1, by Fluent Inc.) performs a numerical approximation of microalgae trajectory (pathline) inside tubular photobioreactor. Consequently, prediction {{of the level of}} hydrodynamic mixing and corresponding light regime inside the photobioreactor with effective use of strong light by high-density algal culture is possible. In the first approach, the <b>algal</b> <b>suspension</b> is considered as a single-phase incompressible viscous Newtonian fluid, which fills the whole section of the photobioreactor photic zone. Coupling the cell trajectories with the corresponding light conditions, the light histories of single cells are obtained. These records contain complete information about light regime in photobioreactor. Computer simulations for various photobioreactor design parameters and operating conditions allow to establish the quantitative relation between variables representing design and operating parameters and light regime parameters. Thus the problem of optimal PBR design could be resolved...|$|E
40|$|When Chlorella {{cells are}} {{ruptured}} at pH 4. 6 by sonication in air, its absorption spectrum can be best explained if one assumes that a long-wave chlorophyll a form (Chl a 693) is preferentially destroyed. Using these preparations, and comparing {{them with the}} <b>algal</b> <b>suspension</b> and the sonicates prepared at pH 7. 8 under argon, we make the following conclusions: (a) The red drop beginning at about 675 - 68 o nm in the action spectrum * of fluorescence at 298 °K must {{be due to the}} presence of a non-(or weakly) fluorescent form of chlorophyll a. We suggest hat this form is Chl a 693. The red drop is absent in the aerobic sonicates. (b) The red drop in fluorescence in whole algal cells is not due to any errors in absorption measurements; this drop is clearly present in the anaerobic sonicates. (c) The emission band at 723 nm, discovered by S. S. BRODY in whole Chlorella cells at 77 °K, may be due to increased fluorescence efficiency of Chl a 693 at low temperature; the F 723 band is absent in aerobic sonicates...|$|E
40|$|Algae {{were grown}} in a {{photobioreactor}} with wastewater centrate as the feed source. lymers nmenta e dewa ults revealed that cationic polymer {{had the lowest}} cost but the highest envi-infrastructure (Yuan et al., 2012). The low biomass concentrations usually achieved in microalgal cultivation systems; however, lead to significant costs for downstream processing of <b>algal</b> <b>suspensions</b> (Uduman et al., 2011). It {{has been estimated that}} harvesting can ac-count for 25 – 60 % of the total cost of microalgae production (Grima et al., 2003). Previous Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies have also have a stro erical cell diameters of 3 – 5 lm and specific gravities only slightly than water are common for green algae, such as Chlorella s grow well in wastewaters (Yuan et al., 2012). Microalgal pro that affect bioflocculation, such as EOM concentration, can change depending on algal growth stage and substrate concentrations (Danquah et al., 2009). In addition, microalgae are capable of restoring their negative surface charge after coagulation, by trans-ferring ions across their cell membrane (Pieterse and Cloot, 1997). Significant research has been carried out on removal of microal-gae from drinking water source waters (see Henderson et al., 2008 for review). Fewer studies have been conducted on harvestin...|$|R
40|$|Enhanced {{diffusion}} of passive tracers immersed in active fluids {{is a universal}} feature of active fluids and has been extensively studied in recent years. Similar to microrheology for equilibrium complex fluids, the unusual enhanced particle dynamics reveal intrinsic properties of active fluids. Nevertheless, previous {{studies have shown that}} the translational dynamics of spherical tracers are qualitatively similar, independent of whether active particles are pushers or pullers [...] -the two fundamental classes of active fluids. Is it possible to distinguish pushers from pullers by simply imaging the dynamics of passive tracers? Here, we investigated the {{diffusion of}} isolated ellipsoids in <b>algal</b> C. reinhardtii <b>suspensions</b> [...] -a model for puller-type active fluids. In combination with our previous results on pusher-type E. coli suspensions [Peng et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 068303 (2016) ], we showed that the dynamics of asymmetric tracers show a profound difference in pushers and pullers due to their rotational degree of freedom. Although the laboratory-frame translation and rotation of ellipsoids are enhanced in both pushers and pullers, similar to spherical tracers, the anisotropic diffusion in the body frame of ellipsoids shows opposite trends in the two classes of active fluids. An ellipsoid diffuses fastest along its major axis when immersed in pullers, whereas it diffuses slowest along the major axis in pushers. This striking difference can be qualitatively explained using a simple hydrodynamic model. In addition, our study on <b>algal</b> <b>suspensions</b> reveals that the influence of the near-field advection of algal swimming flows on the translation and rotation of ellipsoids shows different ranges and strengths. Our work provides not only new insights into universal organizing principles of active fluids, but also a convenient tool for detecting the class of active particles.

40|$|Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) is {{the primary}} product of {{photosynthesis}} and can therefore serve {{as an indicator of}} biomass and photosynthetic activity. Pure NADPH which is the reduced form of NADP shows an absorption maximum at 340 nm and a maximum of emission at 460 nm. NADPH concentrations in terrestrial vegetation have already been studied since 1957 in great detail with optical methods. However, its potential as a biomass parameter of oceanic phytoplankton which can be assessed in situ and remotely with fluorescence spectroscopy has not yet been investigated. In this paper, we report on laboratory investigations of the blue-fluorescence spectrum in <b>algal</b> <b>suspensions</b> of Chlorella and Thalassiosira when excited with UV-A light. It is shown that cell densities of about 106 per litre as they are typically found under natural conditions are too low for precise detection of NADPH fluorescence, while concentrated samples with 108 - 1010 cells per litre exhibit significant blue-fluorescence which can be related to NADPH. Inhibition of photosynthetic activity by addition of DCMU decreases the strength of blue-fluorescence remarkably. Since NADPH is an end product of photosynthesis, changes of PAR illumination levels should directly affect its concentration and hence the intensity of blue-fluorescence. However, no effect of illumination on blue-fluorescence could be observed in our study. Possible reasons of these observations are discussed, and perspectives for practical applications of the method used are proposed...|$|R
