It was also <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> LB Brian Urlacher who ran home an 85-yard interception {{early in the fourth}} quarter, the first of his career. Alex Brown, starting for the injured Mark Anderson, also got an interception which set up Clark's touchdown.|$|E
500|$|At [...] "The Three Pigeons" [...] inn, it is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> some: the miser Boomblehardt {{has been}} out {{collecting}} rents from his tenants, and Sergeant Klooque, hero of Johannesburg, has just arrived at the inn on leave and may now flirt with any lady he chooses, without the need to pretend they are his relatives to get around his tyrannical Colonel. However, it is not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> Martha, the landlady of the inn: staying there is a strange old lady, a mischievous fairy, who refuses to pay or to leave, and who needs neither food nor water. This is substantially cutting into Martha's profits. She enlists Boomblehardt and Klooque, the cowardly farmer Peter, and her extremely shy niece, Pipette, to help solve this problem.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and appeared later at a press conference. Franchitti was happy with the victory, saying {{that he did not}} {{think that it would be}} different to win at the track but that it was [...] "very, very special". He said that after his first pit stop he did not think that he would be able to win the race, and praised his team for their work. Da Matta stated that he was worried about his advantage in the points standings and felt he had the car which could win the event. He added that he could not relax because other drivers still had a mathematical chance of clinching the championship, but he was pleased with the result. Third-place finisher Carpentier said he was happy with his position and that it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> his team. He revealed that changes made to his aerodynamic setup worked on the rolling restarts although it slowed him on the backstraight. Franchitti's race engineer Allen McDonald praised his driver, saying his first victory on an oval track was one that he would remember and that it was an [...] "unbelievable day".|$|E

500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Buemi was delighted with the race victory, praising his team for their work and hoped his recent form would continue into the season's following rounds. His team was concerned over his battery overheating; Buemi stated that he drove cautiously {{in the first few}} laps to know where he was and that he had the entire car package under control. Second-place finisher Vergne stated that he was [...] "very happy" [...] because of his team being recently new having had no prior testing of his car and all new personnel and equipment. He said he corrected the problems he had in the season's first two races and felt certain that he would place his focus into winning races: [...] "I think the whole team did a fantastic job, working really, really hard, sometimes many hours overnight and in the end it paid off." [...] Di Grassi, who finished in third, said that it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> his team although he acknowledged that he was not on the same pace levels as the e.Dams-Renault cars. He revealed that his first car had a large amount of oversteer and stated every smallest change would make a large difference in terms of the championship.|$|E
500|$|Stewart, {{who earned}} $270,136 for the victory, {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win of the season, and his first at Talladega Superspeedway, {{in front of a}} crowd of 145,000. He was delighted to take the victory: [...] "It's one thing to get back to Victory Lane, but to do it at Talladega wow." [...] "I've wanted to win here for so long. This hasn't been one of my favorite places on the fan side. People haven't always liked me here. But this was for those guys up in the stands today." [...] Second-place finisher Menard was pleased with his result, saying he had a good car throughout the duration of the race: [...] "Car had speed in it all day. Didn't make any chassis adjustments, just did a little bit of air pressure after the first run to free it up. It was just all track position really." [...] In the post-race press conference, third-place finisher Ragan said that he felt that he had a car which could have secured the victory under the right circumstances, but believed it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> his team: [...] "We always seem to be pretty fast here on the superspeedway track, so that just goes to show you how much effort our Roush Fenway team is putting into this program." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hamlin, who {{recovered}} from a speeding penalty and loose wheel to finish third, said he [...] "had a great car.

2500|$|The {{wording of}} the statute itself (section 4251) was not changed or {{repealed}}. (As a general rule, a U.S. Federal statute can be repealed only by another statute subsequently enacted by the U.S. Congress.) The change was {{a change in the}} enforcement policy of the Internal Revenue Service to conform to the literal language of the statute and the court decisions interpreting the statute. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow stated in a prepared release, [...] "Today is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> American taxpayers; it marks {{the beginning of the end}} of an outdated, antiquated tax that has survived a century beyond its original purpose, and by now should have been ancient history." [...] Snow also called on the United States Congress [...] "to terminate the remainder of this antique tax by repealing the excise tax on local service as well." ...|$|E
