5|$|Raath (1972) {{noted the}} {{discovery}} of nine fragmentary carnivorous teeth near the pelvic region of the skeleton. He argued that the Vulcanodon carcass might have been embedded with {{the head and neck}} bended backwards above the pelvis, <b>a</b> <b>posture</b> called death pose that is frequently seen in dinosaur skeletons. The teeth would have been the only preserved elements of the skull. However, as shown by Cooper (1984), these teeth do not pertain to Vulcanodon but to a theropod dinosaur that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass.|$|E

The Pali canon contains three passages in which the Buddha describes pressing the tongue against the palate {{for the purposes of}} controlling hunger or the mind, depending on the passage. However, {{there is no mention of}} the tongue being inserted into the nasopharynx as in true khecarī mudrā. The Buddha used <b>a</b> <b>posture</b> where pressure is put on the perineum with the heel, similar to even modern postures used to stimulate Kundalini.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{themselves}} eaten by various {{animals such as}} carnivorous invertebrates and water birds, and are especially vulnerable to predatory fish. Adults generally avoid predators through their hidden lifestyle but are sometimes eaten by herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and mammals such as shrews, badgers and hedgehogs. They secrete the poison tetrodotoxin from their skin, albeit much less than for example the North American Pacific newts (Taricha). The bright yellow or orange underside of crested newts is a warning coloration which can be presented in case of perceived danger. In such <b>a</b> <b>posture,</b> the newts typically roll up and secrete a milky substance.|$|E

5|$|The {{embryonic}} individual of Dinocephalosaurus preserved inside LPV 30280 from Luoping can {{be identified}} as such for several reasons. First, it is enclosed entirely within the body cavity of the adult. Its cervical ribs - which are long, {{like that of the}} adult - face the same direction as the dorsal vertebrae of the adult, which is in contradiction to the typical head-first method of swallowing prey among amniotes. It is also preserved with its neck curling towards its forelimbs, <b>a</b> <b>posture</b> which is seen among vertebrate embryos but not adult Dinocephalosaurus specimens, which generally have the neck bent upwards. The absence of hands associated with the forelimbs in the embryo may be an artifact of preservation, but it may also be due to the sequence in which the limb bones of tetrapods ossify.|$|E
5|$|From 13 December 1909 to 27 March 1910, Yorktown {{operated}} off Corinto, Nicaragua, {{with the}} Nicaraguan Expeditionary Squadron. She then pursued {{a schedule of}} exercises and maneuvers, operating between California and British Columbia through June and July. She returned to <b>a</b> <b>posture</b> of readiness off Corinto and San Juan del Sur between 13 August and 7 September. She then operated off Ecuadorian, Colombian, and Peruvian ports, with the United States Consul General at Large embarked, between 19 September and 16 October before putting into Panama for coal and stores. She subsequently patrolled at Amapala, Honduras, and the familiar Corinto for most of November and December. She spent Christmas at Corinto before shifting to Amapala, en route to San Francisco and Mare Island. From March to July 1911, Yorktown cruised off the west coasts of Mexico, Nicaragua, and Honduras. On 29 May, she rescued the survivors from the foundered Panamanian steamer , which had sunk {{with the loss of}} 60 of its 100 passengers and crew. Another period of repairs and upkeep in the late summer of 1911 proceeded the ship's duties off the Pacific coasts of South and Central America. She returned to Mare Island in May 1912, and was decommissioned there for alterations on 15 July.|$|E

5|$|On 8 January 1960, McNicoll {{was posted}} to the Naval Board in Canberra as Second Naval Member and Chief of Personnel. As noted by {{historian}} Ian Pfennigwerth, McNicoll held this position {{at a time}} in which recruitment and retention in the Navy particularly lagged behind targets. McNicoll was additionally appointed as a trustee of the RAN Relief Trust Fund during this period. Completing his term on the Naval Board, McNicoll was posted as Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet on 8 January 1962 and hoisted his standard aboard , the flagship of the RAN. The Australian government had designated the role of the RAN to be primarily one of anti-submarine warfare, <b>a</b> <b>posture</b> which McNicoll thought unwise. McNicoll argued that surface and air weapons posed a threat equal to that of submarines toward vessels in modern naval warfare. As such, he campaigned for a contemporary aircraft carrier to replace that of HMAS Melbourne. The Army and Air Force opposed McNicoll's stance, and the government ultimately concluded that there was no strategic requirement for a new carrier in light of agreements contained in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. In any event, McNicoll experienced a particularly demanding tenure as Fleet Commander since the RAN {{was in the process of}} a complete overhaul of its order of battle and, as a consequence, he had to manage the introduction and deployment into service of six Ton-class minesweepers acquired from the Royal Navy, along with the first batch of Westland Wessex helicopters and modernised afloat support capabilities. Furthermore, McNicoll was charged with the responsibility of ensuring Australian naval commitments to the Far East Strategic Reserve were met.|$|E

Following {{a review of the}} relevant literature, specific organisational and environmental factors were identified as potential determinants of firms' abilities to adopt <b>an</b> entrepreneurial <b>posture</b> and export performance. The study findings reveal that firms with organic organisational structures and relatively large size are more likely to adopt <b>an</b> entrepreneurial <b>posture.</b> Additionally, entrepreneurial posture was found to impact positively export performance whereas environmental hostility affects negatively export performance.

30|$|Therefore, we take {{a policy}} of looking for {{suitable}} posture sequence in advance. Instead of manually giving <b>a</b> grasping <b>posture</b> in <b>a</b> descending manner, {{we take a}}n approach to repeating trial and error according to various grasping methods. However, {{there is a big}} problem with this approach: As the number of target postures increases, the dimension of the parameter space to be searched becomes larger, so that it is not realistic to obtain an appropriate solution. Therefore, we decided to find an appropriate grasping method by limiting the end-effector postures to be searched to two kinds; <b>a</b> via <b>posture</b> and <b>a</b> grasping <b>posture.</b>|$|R

One strong argument is that Lansdowne, Secretary of State for War, did not believe the Boers were preparing for war, and also believed that if Britain were to send large numbers of troops, it would strike too aggressive <b>a</b> <b>posture</b> and so prevent a negotiated settlement being reached or even encourage a Boer attack.|$|E
25|$|The {{proboscis}} of the tapir is {{a highly}} flexible organ, able to move in all directions, allowing the animals to grab foliage {{that would otherwise be}} out of reach. Tapirs often exhibit the flehmen response, <b>a</b> <b>posture</b> in which they raise their snouts and show their teeth to detect scents. This response is frequently exhibited by bulls sniffing for signs of other males or females in oestrus in the area. The length of the proboscis varies among species; Malayan tapirs have the longest snouts and Brazilian tapirs have the shortest. The evolution of tapir probosces, made up almost entirely of soft tissues rather than bony internal structures, gives the Tapiridae skull a unique form in comparison to other perissodactyls, with a larger sagittal crest, orbits positioned more rostrally, a posteriorly telescoped cranium, and a more elongated and retracted nasoincisive incisure.|$|E
25|$|Throughout 1955 and 1956, Nasser {{pursued a}} number of {{policies}} that would frustrate British aims throughout the Middle East, and result in increasing hostility between Britain and Egypt. Nasser saw Iraq's inclusion in the Baghdad Pact as indicating that the United States and Britain had sided with his much hated archenemy Nuri as-Said's efforts {{to be the leader}} of the Arab world, and much of the motivation for Nasser's turn to an active anti-Western policy starting in 1955 was due to his displeasure with the Baghdad Pact. For Nasser, attendance at such events as the Bandung conference in April 1955 served as both the means of striking <b>a</b> <b>posture</b> as a global leader, and of playing hard to get in his talks with the Americans, especially his demand that the United States sell him vast quantities of arms.|$|E

40|$|Sleep is {{characterized}} by reduced muscle activity resulting in reduced movement and <b>a</b> typical <b>posture</b> compatible with relaxed muscles. Prior to each molt, C. elegans larvae go through a phase of behavioral quiescence called Lethargus.
