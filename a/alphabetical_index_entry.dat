500|$|The Relative Index (or, as Dewey spelled it, [...] "Relativ Index") is an <b>alphabetical</b> <b>index</b> to the classification, for {{use both}} by {{classifiers}} {{but also by}} library users when seeking books by topic. The index was [...] "relative" [...] because the <b>index</b> <b>entries</b> pointed to the class numbers, not to the page numbers of the printed classification schedule. In this way, the Dewey Decimal Classification itself had the same relative positioning as the library shelf and could be used either as an entry point to the classification, by catalogers, or as an index to the Dewey-classed library itself.|$|R
40|$|The centenary of {{the year}} in which Melvil Dewey founded the first library school in the United States and the year of a major review of {{librarianship}} education in Britain seems an appropriate time for Education for Information to initiate what is intended to become an annual bibliography of work in librarianship and informa-tion science education and training. The bibliography covers works published in ~ 986 and is international in scope although the majority of items are in English. In future the coverage of material in other languages will be increased. The arrangement is by subject and then alphabetically by author or title. The name index includes name subject entries for individuals and institutions. The <b>alphabetical</b> subject <b>index</b> includes <b>entries</b> under names of countries. A list of periodical title abbreviations used is also supplied.

40|$|This is {{the third}} year of this annual {{bibliography}} of work in librarianship and information science education and training. The bibliography covers works pub-lished in 1988 and is international in scope. The arrangement is by subject and then alphabetical by author or title, with a contents list facilitating broad subject access. The name index includes authors and name subject entries for individuals, organizations and some other entities. The <b>alphabetical</b> subject <b>index</b> includes <b>entries</b> for names of countries and regions. A list of periodical title abbreviations used is also supplied. As in previous years, compilation of the bibliography has used in the main the collections and resources of the library of the College of Librarianship Wales. 1988 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the College and also {{the start of a new}} era in its life. By the time this bibliography is published, in fact as of August 1, 1989, the College will have merged with the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth.
