In September 1956, he was elected as an <b>alternate</b> <b>member</b> of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.|$|E
5|$|Although only an <b>alternate</b> <b>member</b> of the {{tribunal}} without a vote, {{his voice was}} heard {{in all of its}} deliberations, his hand drafted a large and most important part of its judgment, and no one connected with {{the tribunal}}, member or otherwise, had a greater part than he in shaping the final result. If, as I confidently believe, the work of the tribunal will constitute a landmark in the development of world order based on law, to Norman Birkett must go a large share of the credit for the success of the undertaking. To few men does the opportunity come to labour so mightily for the welfare of their kind.|$|E
5|$|Reagan {{was first}} elected to the Board of Directors of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) in 1941, serving as an <b>alternate</b> <b>member.</b> After World War II, he resumed service and became third {{vice-president}} in 1946. The adoption of conflict-of-interest bylaws in 1947 led the SAG president and six board members to resign; Reagan was nominated in a special election for the position of president and was subsequently elected. He was chosen by the membership to serve seven additional one-year terms, from 1947 to 1952 and in 1959. Reagan led the SAG through eventful years that were marked by labor-management disputes, the Taft–Hartley Act, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings and the Hollywood blacklist era.|$|E

5|$|Peng {{had been}} an <b>alternate</b> <b>member</b> of the Central Committee since 1934, a full member since 1938, {{and a member of}} the Politburo since 1945, but it was not until he became the leader of the PLA and moved {{permanently}} to Beijing, in November 1953, that Peng was able to attend regular political meetings and became active in domestic politics. Peng had been loyal to Mao's leadership since the 1935 Zunyi Conference, and continued to support Mao for several years after moving to Beijing. Peng (like Lin Biao) was implicated in passively supporting Gao Gang's effort to replace Liu Shaoqi as the second most powerful person in China in 1953, but then opposed Gao in 1954, once Mao made his own opposition clear. Mao did not take any action against Peng (or Lin), but Peng's involvement alienated Peng from Liu and Liu's supporters. In 1955 Peng supported Mao's efforts to collectivize agriculture. Along with Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Lin Biao, Lin Boqu, and Luo Ronghuan, Peng opposed Mao's attempt to liberalize China's culture and politics in the first stages of the 1957 Hundred Flowers Campaign, but then supported Mao's efforts to arrest and persecute Chinese citizens who had criticized the CCP later that year.|$|E
5|$|Peng {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} generals active in defending the Jiangxi Soviet, taking a leading role in defeating Chiang Kai-shek's first three Encirclement Campaigns, from December 1930 – May 1931. His successes were outmatched only by Lin Biao. On November 7, Peng was named to the Central Military Commission and to the Central Executive Committee of the Jiangxi Soviet, the first time that he had been named to a position of political leadership within the communist movement. After the consolidation of the Jiangxi Soviet, a number of USSR-trained Communist Party leaders arrived and took power in the Soviet: Peng, like most communist military leaders, supported their leadership until the Jiangxi Soviet was eventually overrun. In August 1933, Peng was named Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission; and, in January 1934, Peng was appointed as an <b>alternate</b> <b>member</b> to the Sixth CCP Central Committee. Peng continued the defense of the Jiangxi Soviet throughout the early 1930s. In August 1933, after the indecisive Fourth Encirclement Campaign, Peng broke through Kuomintang defenses and conquered a large area of western Fujian, capturing great quantities of arms and ammunition.|$|E
5|$|The elected 10th Central Committee {{comprised}} 81 (52.5 percent) {{members from}} the 9th Central Committee, and 79 (47.5 percent) new members were elected. The candidate with the highest vote received 97.88 percent, while the candidate with the lowest vote received 63.41 percent. All the provinces, {{with the exception of}} Đắk Nông Province, elected officials to the 10th Central Committee. A number of surprises occurred during the election process; six ministers were not re-elected. Another surprise was that no officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were elected as full members. However, Phạm Bình Minh, the Director of the International Organizations Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was elected as an <b>alternate</b> <b>member.</b> None of the 34 self-nominated candidates at the congress were elected to the 10th Central Committee. It is unknown whether any of the self-nominees for alternate membership in the 10th Central Committee were elected. There was an increase in Central Committee officials working in the central government, the provinces, military and defence officials, public security officials and officials from mass organizations, but there was a decrease in officials from the sectors of information, social and cultural affairs, economics, business and financial affairs, and others.|$|E

25|$|In 1982 Escobar {{was elected}} as an <b>alternate</b> <b>member</b> of the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia, {{as part of}} a small {{movement}} called Liberal Alternative. Earlier in the campaign he was a candidate for the Liberal Renewal Movement, but had to leave it because of the firm opposition of Luis Carlos Galán, whose presidential campaign was supported by the Liberal Renewal Movement. Thanks to his seat in the parliament, Escobar was the official representative of the Colombian government for the swearing-in of Felipe González in Spain.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, Escobar {{was elected}} as an <b>alternate</b> <b>member</b> of the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia {{as part of}} the Liberal Alternative movement.

In 1993, Escobar was shot and killed in his hometown by Colombian National Police, one day after his 44th birthday.|$|E
50|$|The 8th Politburo of the Communist Party of China {{was elected}} at the 1st Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee on September 28, 1956, {{consisting}} of 17 <b>members</b> and 6 <b>alternate</b> <b>members.</b> There were {{additions to the}} membership in 1958 and 1966.

5000|$|The primary {{difference}} between full <b>members</b> and <b>alternate</b> <b>members</b> is that full members have voting rights. <b>Alternate</b> <b>members</b> attend Central Committee plenary sessions, and can presumably voice {{their views on}} issues, but {{do not have the}} right to vote. At party plenary sessions, members of the Politburo seats at the front of the auditorium or meeting hall, facing the rest of the Central Committee. Full members are ordered by protocol, and seated, according to [...] "surname stroke order" [...] (xingshi bihua paiming), an impartial ordering system that is roughly equivalent of alphabetizing the names. <b>Alternate</b> <b>members</b> follow a different protocol sequence: they are arranged by the number of votes received when they were elected at the previous Party Congress.|$|R
