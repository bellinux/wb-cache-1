500|$|Recalling {{the release}} {{in his book}} Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald writes that, with Revolver, the Beatles [...] "had {{initiated}} a second pop revolution – one which while galvanising their existing rivals and inspiring many new ones, left all of them far behind". In a February 1967 review, Hit Parader declared: [...] "Revolver represents the pinnacle of pop music. No group has been as consistently creative as the Beatles, though the [...] Spoonful and Beach Boys are coming closer all the time... Rather than analyze the music we just suggest that you listen to Revolver {{three or four times}} a day and marvel..." [...] Later that year, in Esquire, Robert Christgau called the album [...] "twice as good and four times as startling as Rubber Soul, with sound effects, Oriental drones, jazz bands, transcendentalist lyrics, all kinds of rhythmic and harmonic surprises, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>filter</b> that made John Lennon sound like God singing through a foghorn".|$|E
500|$|A simple form of {{directional}} coupler is two parallel transmission lines coupled together over a λ/4 length. [...] This design is limited because the electrical {{length of the}} coupler will only be λ/4 at one specific frequency. [...] Coupling will be a maximum at this frequency and fall away on either side. [...] Similar to the impedance matching case, this can be improved by using multiple elements, resulting in a filter-like structure. [...] A waveguide analogue of this coupled lines approach is the Bethe-hole {{directional coupler}} in which two parallel waveguides are stacked {{on top of each}} other and a hole provided for coupling. [...] To produce a wideband design, multiple holes are used along the guides [...] as shown in figure 14 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>filter</b> design applied. [...] It is not only the coupled-line design that suffers from being narrow band, all simple designs of waveguide coupler depend on frequency in some way. [...] For instance the rat-race coupler (which can be implemented directly in waveguide) works on a completely different principle but still relies on certain lengths being exact in terms of λ.|$|E
