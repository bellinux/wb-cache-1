5|$|Former {{prisoners of}} war were given <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> {{repatriation}} back to Australia and discharge. Planning for the recovery of prisoners of the Japanese, most {{of whom had been}} held in harsh conditions, had begun in 1944 and the 2nd and 3rd Australian Prisoner of War Reception Groups were established at Singapore and Manila respectively in August 1945. By the end of September most of the prisoners recovered from Singapore, Java and Sumatra had been returned to Australia along with about half of those recovered from the Bangkok area. Transport shortages delayed the repatriation of Australian prisoners from Formosa, Japan and Korea, but almost all were on their way home by mid-September.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} {{address to the}} legislature, Morehead {{recommended}} a plan of expanded internal improvements, including improvements along the state's rivers. The legislature responded by creating a state board of internal improvements, and named Morehead the ex-officio president of the board. In this role, he authorized many surveys of Kentucky's rivers and formulated several plans for improvements, {{but most of them}} were blocked by the Panic of 1837. One improvement that did proceed was construction of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad, which was completed in 1835. Though education was not <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> Governor Morehead, the Kentucky Common School Society and the Kentucky Association of Professional Teachers were formed during his term.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1944, Tibbets {{reported}} to Colorado Springs Army Airfield, {{the headquarters of}} the Second Air Force, where he met with its commander, Major General Uzal Ent, and three representatives of the Manhattan Project, Lieutenant Colonel John Lansdale Jr., Captain William S. Parsons, and Norman F. Ramsey Jr., who briefed him on the project. Tibbets was told that he would {{be in charge of the}} 509th Composite Group, a fully self-contained organization of about 1,800 men, which would have 15 B-29s and <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> all kinds of military stores. Ent gave Tibbets a choice of three possible bases: Great Bend Army Airfield, Kansas; Mountain Home Army Airfield, Idaho; or Wendover Army Air Field, Utah. Tibbets selected Wendover for its remoteness.|$|E

5|$|Downloadable content (DLC) was {{initially}} {{not part of}} the development team's plans. The Missing Link began development later in development, when the main game's visual theme had been finalized. Only the core developers were involved in creating The Missing Link, though development on the DLC did not take <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> some time as it would take resources away from the development of Human Revolution. Director Jean-François Dugas, producer David Anfossi, and art director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête all returned to their previous roles. The main designer was Antoine Thisdale. Main writer Mary DeMarle returned to write the scenario, alongside supplementary writer and author James Swallow. Additional music was composed for The Missing Link by the game's composer Michael McCann. He wanted to include music from the DLC in the game's , but recording for the release was already complete, and scheduling conflicts prevented him from including any music in the soundtrack. Despite this, he still wished to release the DLC soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur and Kenney did prevail on Washington {{to provide}} more troop carrier aircraft. In July, SWPA was given <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> {{transport}} aircraft, with six additional squadrons earmarked {{to bring it up}} to two groups. They were scheduled to arrive in November and December, but their movement was expedited, and the first new squadron, the 6th Troop Carrier Squadron, reached Port Moresby on 14 October. Part of the 33rd Troop Carrier Squadron was held up in the South Pacific Area, which also had urgent needs. In the meantime, ten DC-3s were converted into C-49s and C-50s at the Sacramento Air Depot and flown out to Australia, where they were allocated to the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron in September. Ten C-60 Lodestars were also despatched, which joined the 22nd Troop Carrier Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{worked on}} the {{character}} designs for the main cast. He was originally only {{going to work on}} Aya and Eve, but after seeing the settings for the other characters, he offered to design them too. The team wanted to emphasize the character's sexuality. As part of this, the team included a scene where Aya takes a shower. This was inspired by a similar scene in Parasite Eve II. When the title was being developed for PSP, the team's main challenge with the character was to make her look as realistic as possible while retaining her established physical traits. Using this new realism, the team wanted to portray the fear felt by humans when faced with such threats through Aya. Achieving this realism proved {{one of the most difficult}} aspects of development. Her alternate costumes were not <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> the team, so their artists had high creative freedom.|$|E

5|$|SCI is {{extremely}} disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens to young people, {{who are at}} a peak in their sexual and reproductive lives. Yet the importance of sexuality {{as a part of}} life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown sexuality to be <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function. Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life post-injury. People who are able to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better overall quality of life.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Ocean was a {{vital part}} of the chain of trade links that {{connected}} the British Empire. Merchant ships from China, Arabia and East Africa crossed it regularly and at its centre was the British-held continent of India, from which heavily laden East Indiamen brought millions of pounds worth of trade goods to Britain every year. Trade with India was vital to the financial security of Britain and consequently the trade routes across the Indian Ocean were <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> protection from the Royal Navy and at serious risk from French raiders. The outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, following the brief Peace of Amiens that had ended the French Revolutionary Wars, placed the Indian Ocean trade routes under threat from Dutch cruisers operating from Cape Town and the Dutch East Indies and French ships based on Isle de France and the newly renamed Île Bonaparte. By 1808, most of the Dutch colonies had been neutralised in a series of brief but successful campaigns; the Cape by Sir Home Riggs Popham in January 1806 and the Dutch island of Java by Sir Edward Pellew in a campaign that ended in December 1807. The French Indian Ocean islands were however far more defensible: heavily fortified, garrisoned by regular French soldiers and several months voyage from the nearest British port, they presented a much greater challenge to the limited British forces available in the region.|$|E

50|$|Bondholders {{typically}} value a risk-averse strategy {{since they}} do not benefit from higher profits. Stockholders {{on the other hand}} have an interest in taking on more risk. If a risky project succeeds shareholders will get all of the profits themselves, whereas if the projects fail the risk maybe shared with the bondholder (although the bondholder has <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> repayment in case of issuer bankruptcy than a shareholder).|$|R
50|$|In January 2015 the {{campaign}} published a report, Business Backs Education, analyzing the charitable education donations {{of the global}} top 500 companies, recommending that education be <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> corporate social responsibility spending.

50|$|The sIG 33 {{was rather}} heavy for its mission, {{and it was}} {{redesigned}} in the late 1930s to incorporate light alloys. This saved about 150 kg, but the outbreak of war forced the return to the original design before {{more than a few}} hundred were made, as the Luftwaffe had <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> light alloys. <b>A</b> new carriage, made entirely of light alloys, was tested around 1939, but was not accepted for service.|$|R

25|$|The Catholic {{doctrine}} of {{the resurrection of the}} body does nor subscribe that, sees body and soul as forming a whole and states that at the second coming, the souls of the departed will be reunited with their bodies as a whole person (substance) and witness to the apocalypse. The thorough consistency between dogma and contemporary science was maintained here in part from a serious attendance to the principle that there can be only one truth. Consistency with science, logic, philosophy, and faith remained <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> centuries, and a university doctorate in theology generally included the entire science curriculum as a prerequisite. This doctrine is not universally accepted by Christians today. Many believe that one's immortal soul goes directly to Heaven upon death of the body.|$|E
