This corresponds to 54.5 and 80.2 % of the theoretical yield, based on previous calculations (Christakopoulos et al. 1991 a).|$|E
30|$|The maximum {{bioethanol}} yield obtained {{under the}} optimised SSC conditions from untreated wheat straw/bran was far below industrially exploitable yields. But it {{was higher than}} the levels recently reported for the fungi N. crassa, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Gloeophyllum trabeum and T. reesei (Dogaris et al. 2009; Rasmussen et al. 2010; Shrestha et al. 2010). More importantly this is the highest reported bioethanol yield from any unprocessed lignocellulosic material. When using <b>alkali-treated</b> <b>straw,</b> Christakopoulos et al. (1991 a) observed that F. oxysporum strain F 3 produced up to 275 mg bioethanol g- 1 of substrate, corresponding to 67.8 % of the theoretical yield. Using similar culture conditions and <b>alkali-treated</b> <b>straw,</b> we found that F. oxysporum strain 11 C could yield up to 80.2 % of the theoretical yield of bioethanol. This yield was also higher than that reported for other fungi grown on pre-treated agricultural waste (Deshpande et al. 1986; Mizuno et al. 2009; Karimi et al. 2006; Okamoto et al. 2011; Goshadrou et al. 2011). When unprocessed straw was used, strain 11 C produced 5.3 -fold more bioethanol than strain 7 E. But in case of <b>alkali-treated</b> <b>straw</b> this difference was 1.5 -fold. This indicates that strain 11 C is more efficient than strain 7 E in converting both delignified and untreated straw to bioethanol, but the difference was more acute in the latter case. Chemical de-lignification represents a significant cost in lignocellulose bioprocessing and the development or identification of factors that could contribute to alternative approaches could {{reduce the cost of}} bioethanol production, particularly if such a factor were a component part of a CBP process.|$|E

The fungus expressed high enzymes production at moisture level 70 % (w/w), initial pH 4. 5, inoculum size 10 % (v/w) at 32 �C after 72 h which yielded 31. 5, 46. 0 and 215. 2 I U/g original substrate.

30|$|Some {{cellulase}} reagents {{for effective}} hydrolysis of <b>alkali-treated</b> rice <b>straw</b> were first selected from 15 kinds of commercial cellulase reagents {{based on the}} calculation of regression analysis method on Excel solver, {{which is one of}} the multiple classification analysis. The relational expression was estimated by statistical method on explanatory variable and objective variable about hydrolysis efficient by each enzyme. The explanatory variables were derived by enzymatic activities of endo-β-glucanase (EBG), cellobiohydrolase (CBH), β-glucosidase (BGL), xylanase (XN), β-xylosidase (BX), Filter paper degradation activity (FPU), and unwoven cellulosic cloth (BEMCOT®) degradation activity (BCU). The objective variables (hydrolysis activity) were derived by hydrolysis activities analyzed with 10  g/L pretreated straw by each enzyme reagent of 1  g-protein/L at 30  °C, pH 5.5, and 120  rpm. The activities were determined as reducing-sugar production per 1  min. These enzymatic activities as variables were fed to regression analysis tool in Excel and regression expression was obtained from coefficients in displayed analysis of variance (ANOVA) table containing significant value (F value), coefficients, and probability value (P value), etc. Three kinds of reagents were selected based on the high coefficients of activity in the expression. Next, an optimum ratio of these reagents mixture was constructed by design of experiments (DOE) method using Design-Expart® 8.

30|$|Fusarium oxysporum {{requires}} an aerobic growth phase (for initial fungal growth) {{followed by an}} oxygen-limited fermentation phase {{in order to produce}} ethanol from glucose (Panagiotou et al. 2005 a). To optimise the performance of F. oxysporum during the fermentation phase, a limited oxygen supply of 18 – 20  % is required (Panagiotou et al. 2005 d). Such level of oxygen will facilitate growth and the breakdown of acetate by growing cells (Enari and Suihko 1983). As shown in Table  1, the highest reported bioethanol yield from any unprocessed lignocellulosic material by a filamentous fungus to date was achieved by F. oxysporum strain 11 C, producing up to 80  mg bioethanol g− 1 wheat straw/bran (Ali et al. 2012 b). With <b>alkali-treated</b> <b>straw</b> as the substrate, the yield increased to 326  mg bioethanol g− 1 wheat straw/bran, a theoretical yield of 80.2  %. Although still below industrial exploitable yields, this yield is higher than that reported for other fungi grown on pre-treated agricultural waste (Deshpande et al. 1986; Mizuno et al. 2009; Karimi et al. 2006; Okamoto et al. 2011 a, b; Goshadrou et al. 2011). Interestingly, the ability of F. oxysporum to produce ethanol during CBP was found not be reflective of either cellulose or alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity (Ali et al. 2012 b). Explorative work by Ali et al. (2014) identified a large consortium of F. oxysporum genes (< 210) that were upregulated in F. oxysporum strain 11 C and may have conferred this strain with an enhanced capacity for bioethanol production from lignocellulosic residues. These genes were identified by comparing the transcriptome of F. oxysporum strain 11 C with that of a low efficacy F. oxysporum strain. Many of the genes identified and their encoded proteins could be assigned to various categories such as carbohydrate metabolism, energy, protein and sugar transport and detoxification. Furthermore, a consortium of novel genes were discovered that had no direct link to saccharification or fermentation but were shown to be activated during CBP, highlighting the complexity of the process (Ali et al. 2014). Another promising strain, F. oxysporum strain F 3, has been reported to directly convert alkali-treated and ball-milled wheat straw to bioethanol, producing 67.8 and 83  % of theoretical yield, respectively (Christakopoulos et al. 1991 a, b). The same strain has been reported to yield 109  g bioethanol kg− 1 of dry alkali- pretreated brewer’s spent grain under microaerobic conditions, corresponding to 60  % of the theoretical yield (Xiros and Christakopoulos 2009). Further studies were done with this particular F. oxysporum strain to saccharify and co-ferment wheat straw with S. cerevisiae (Panagiotou et al. 2011); yields of bioethanol were very promising (40  g kg− 1 of pretreated wheat straw).|$|E
30|$|In all {{hydrolysis}} {{reactions of}} the substrate, indicated pH were almost constant value through the reactions. In the reaction with Cellulase T as shown in Fig.  5 a, disaccharides, glucose, xylose, and arabinose were began to release in the early stage of the reaction and concentrations of them grew continuously for 96  h. Glucose kept increasing and achieved 30.1  g/L at 96  h, which was 46 % of the cellulose content in the straw. This behavior was caused by high CBH and BGL activity in Cellulase T; that is, CBH in the reagent behaved for disaccharides production, and immediately, it converted to glucose by BGL activity with keeping apparent disaccharides on at low level. However, low EBG activity in the reagent caused scarce degradation of amorphous part of cellulose fiber that suppressed glucose production, though FPU activity was relatively high compared with other reagent, as shown in Fig.  2. Total concentration of glucose and xylose was 42.4  g/L and the hydrolysis efficiency was 53 % based on the total cellulose and hemicellulose content in the straw. In hydrolysis of the straw by Pectinase G, glucose and xylose could be produced without disaccharide accumulation through the reaction due to low CBH activity (Fig.  5 b). The amount of produced glucose was 30.3  g/L which was {{the same level of}} Cellulase T. At the same time, 12.2  g/L of xylose was able to be produced for 96  h and the yield was 84.1 % of hemicellulose content in the straw. That was the highest yield among the three reagents alone due to particular high XN and BX activity. In the hydrolysis reaction of Onozuka as shown in Fig.  5 c, glucose, xylose, disaccharide, and arabinose were produced from the straw. Glucose and xylose were produced at the concentration of 45.6 and 10.0  g/L, respectively, for 96  h. The sum concentration of these sugars was 55.7  g/L that showed hydrolysis efficiency of 69.6 %. The highest amount of disaccharide was produced by the reagent among the three kinds of reagents at the concentration of 15.9  g/L for 96  h. Disaccharide (mostly cellobiose) accumulation was caused by low BGL activity in Onozuka, whereas EBG, CBH, and BCU activities were high. In fact, oligosaccharides that had various lengths were detected by HPLC analysis (not identified). Accumulated disaccharides had to be degraded to glucose and xylose for fermentation to ethanol. Meanwhile, on hydrolysis of the treated straw by the optimized cocktail as shown in Fig.  5 d, higher glucose and xylose concentrations achieved at 53.2 and 13.5  g/L than that in the reactions with three single reagents, respectively. The yields of glucose and xylose from the straw was 81.2 and 93.1 %, respectively. The hydrolysis efficiency on total fermentable sugars reached 83.3 %. These were the highest value among the four patterns of reactions and that represented the cocktail greatly affected hydrolysis of the <b>alkali-treated</b> <b>straw</b> by interaction of the three reagents. In addition, glucose production proceeded satisfactory without accumulation of disaccharides. Combination with Cellulase T that possesses high CBH, BGL and FPU and Onozuka that possess high EBG, CBH, and BCU was able to progress degradation of disaccharides to glucose by synergy effect of these activities each other. Particularly, BGL in Cellulase T interacted with disaccharides produced by Onozuka activity. Moreover, since disaccharides contained not only cellobiose but also xylobiose, the BX activity in Pectinase G affected the xylobiose that produced by activity in Onozuka to induce xylose production.|$|E

In brief, fungal inoculum was grown aerobically in a 250 ml Büchner flask containing 50 ml minimal medium and 1 % (wv- 1) alkali treated cellulose and 0.15 % (wv- 1) wheat bran as carbon sources. After 3 days, cultures were amended with 1.5 g of dry-sterilised <b>alkali-treated</b> wheat <b>straw</b> and grown under oxygen-limiting condition for 4 - 6 days.

The expression confirmed {{the requirement of}} these four activities for hydrolysis of the treated straw. From these viewpoints, Cellulase T Amano 4 (denoted by Cellulase T) with high activities of CBH, FPU, and BCU, and Cellulase Onozuka 3 S (Onozuka) with high CBH, EBG, and BCU were chosen as candidates for preparing a cocktail.

30|$|Aspergillus aculeatus [NBRC 108796], a {{filamentous}} fungus {{isolated from the}} soil, produces a number of extracellular cellulose- and hemicellulose-degrading enzymes that exhibit synergism with Trichoderma cellulases. <b>Alkali-treated</b> rice <b>straw</b> was shown to be hydrolyzed almost completely into monosaccharides by mixed-culture filtrate of these two species (Murao et al. [1979, 1988]). Previously, we constructed a host–vector system of A. aculeatus that expressed the A. aculeatus β-mannosidase gene (Kanamasa et al. [2003]). The A. aculeatus expression system yielded a 10 -fold higher level of the enzyme than did an Aspergillus oryzae expression system, indicating the high potential of A. aculeatus as a factory to produce useful proteins (Kanamasa et al. [2007]). However, the concerted action of several cellulases, each with different properties, {{is considered to be}} essential for the effective hydrolysis of cellulose into monosaccharides. To breed A. aculeatus that simultaneously produces many types of cellulases, a marker-recycling technique, enabling to excise a selection marker gene from transformants without leaving any exogenous DNA fragments, must be developed (Akada et al. [2006]). This technique enables the excision of a selection marker gene from transformants without leaving exogenous DNA fragments; multiple cellulase genes can be introduced into a host strain with a limited number of selection markers. Furthermore, elucidating how the expressions of the cellulose-degrading enzyme-encoding genes are regulated will improve enzyme production. Therefore, one must develop highly-efficient homologous recombination (HR) techniques as well as a marker-recycling technique in the imperfect fungus A. aculeatus.|$|R

Thus, rice straw is a significant by-product, whose use in a biorefinery process would contribute to the bio-based transformation of the Vietnamese and South East Asian economy. In order to find novel efficient enzyme mixtures for the hydrolysis of rice straw and other agricultural residues, we took advantage of the rapidly evolving biodiversity of Vietnam and screened 1100 new fungal isolates from soil and decaying plant tissues for their CMCase activity. We selected 36 strains and evaluated them for their cellulases, xylanases, and accessory enzymes activities. Most of these isolates belonged to the genera Aspergillus and Trichoderma. We identified a few promising isolates, such as A. brunneoviolaceus FEC 156, A. niger FEC 130 and FEC 705, and A. tubingensis FEC 98, FEC 110 and FEC 644, whose produced enzyme mixtures released a mass fraction of the sugar content of <b>alkali-treated</b> rice <b>straw</b> higher than 20 %, compared to 10 % for Trichoderma reesei RUT C- 30.

For the saccharification of rice straw, a combination of cellulase (Celluclast 1.5 L), β-glucosidase (Novozyme 188), and enzyme complex (Ultraflo L) was used for enzymatic saccharification. All enzymes were obtained from Novozymes Japan (Chiba, Japan). The enzyme activity of Celluclast 1.5 L was 80 FPU/mL; β-glucosidase with an enzyme activity of 322 CBU/mL was used to hydrolyze cellobiose. Ultraflo L contained cellulase, xylanase, pentosanase, and arabanase, with an activity of 45 FBG/g. To evaluate the SSF performance of the selected strain, S. cerevisiae NBRC 0224, S. stipitis NBRC 10063, and C. shehatae ATCC 22984 were used as control strains.
