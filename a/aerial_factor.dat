60|$|Now the {{strategy}} of this new sort of war in its opening phase will consist mainly in very rapid movements of guns and men behind that thin screen of marksmen, {{in order to deal}} suddenly and unexpectedly some forcible blow, to snatch at some position into which guns and men may be thrust to outflank and turn the advantage of the ground against some portion of the enemy's line. The game will be largely to crowd and crumple that line, to stretch it over an arc to the breaking point, to secure a position from which to shell and destroy its supports and provisions, and to capture or destroy its guns and apparatus, and so tear it away from some town or arsenal it has covered. And a factor of primary importance in this warfare, because of the importance of seeing the board, a factor which will be enormously stimulated to develop in the future, will be the <b>aerial</b> <b>factor.</b> Already we have seen the captive balloon as an incidental accessory of considerable importance even in the wild country warfare of South Africa. In the warfare that will go on in the highly-organized European States of the opening century, the special military balloon used in conjunction with guns, conceivably of small calibre but of enormous length and range, will play a part of quite primary importance. These guns will be carried on vast mechanical carriages, possibly with wheels of such a size as will enable them to traverse almost all sorts of ground.[40] The aeronauts, provided with large scale maps of the hostile country, will mark down to the gunners below the precise point upon which to direct their fire, and over hill and dale the shell will fly--ten miles it may be--to its billet, camp, massing night attack, or advancing gun.|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between air quality and respiratory health and comfort in {{humans and animals}} has been widely shown. In general, a state of respiratory discomfort in everyday indoor and outdoor life results {{in an increase in}} audible acoustic symptoms. The general concept of sound analysis as an objective, contactless, and non-invasive biomarker for aerial stressors was studied on free-field registered cough sounds of 12 Belgian Landrace piglets. A citric acid-induced cough sound-recognition algorithm with a recognition percentage of 95 % was applied to cough sounds registered in the presence of distinct types of aerial factors: irritating gas (ammonia), respirable particles (dust), and climate (temperature). The recognition percentage for all <b>aerial</b> <b>factors</b> exceeded 90 % and averaged 94 %. Therefore, it was concluded that sound analysis could provide an effective biomarker for all three types of <b>aerial</b> <b>factors.</b> The generality of the biomarker is speculated to arise from the common mechanism involved in protective cough, which will stand as long as no physical changes (e. g., growth, disease) to the state of the respiratory system occur. The results suggest that sound analysis as a biomarker of the respiratory state may be integrated into room or personalized air ventilation control to improve respiratory comfort of animals. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{a complex}} forest {{association}} such {{as found in}} Indiana one is confronted with interesting distribution patterns of some species. These same species may to some degree all associate in the mixed mesophytic forest association. All of them are adapted to the macroclimate but can be segregated from the climax association complex into smaller individual groups by variations of the microclimate. This is determined by physiographic conditions which may modify <b>aerial</b> and edaphic <b>factors.</b> Potzger has discussed this phenomenon as operative in distribution of sugar maple, beech and white oak. Potsger and Friesner referred to it in Quercus rubra and Q. velutina. All of these segregations are, of course, due to modifications of the macroclimate in more or less limited areas. It is quite obvious that identical soil and physiographic factors in Indiana and northern Michigan, let us say, could not involve segregation of the same genera and species with small variations in the edaphic and <b>aerial</b> <b>factors</b> because of the major selection of species by the macroclimate, or generalized climate, which is greatly different in the two locations...|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s {{the steep}} {{approach}} necessary for aircraft flying to Nutts Corner was deemed unsuitable. This was due to the location of the airport, close to the Belfast mountains and the obstacles located there, particularly transmitters and <b>aerials.</b> Another <b>factor</b> was the fact that of Nutts Corner's three runways, only one was suitable for modern aircraft. Aldergrove's two runways set at 100 degrees (07-25 and 17-35) to each other made operations possible even if conditions (particularly wind) changed dramatically. The decision to restore civil flights to Aldergrove was taken in July 1959. The move was made official in September 1963 and a month later the present terminal was opened.|$|R
40|$|Eleven {{finishing}} {{units were}} surveyed {{to study the}} characteristics of <b>aerial</b> dust and <b>factors</b> that influence dust concentrations. Feed dust was the major portion of the total dust mass and can be minimized with feed additives, less feed wastage, enclosed feed delivery, and periodic cleaning. Ventilation was the primary method for dust removal. Naturally ventilated buildings had higher dust concentrations than mechanically ventilated buildings because of lower average airflow rates, especially during cold weather. Swine workers can minimize respiratory symptoms by wearing face masks...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to apply and verify landslide-susceptibility {{analysis}} techniques using an artificial neural network and a Geographic Information System (GIS) applied to Baguio City, Philippines. The 16 July 1990 earthquake-induced landslides were studied. Landslide locations were identified from interpretation of aerial photographs and field survey, and a spatial database was constructed from topographic maps, geology, land cover and terrain mapping units. Factors that influence landslide occurrence, such as slope, aspect, curvature and distance from drainage were calculated from the topographic database. Lithology and distance from faults were derived from the geology database. Land cover was identified from the topographic database. Terrain map units were interpreted from <b>aerial</b> photographs. These <b>factors</b> were used with an artificial neural network to analyze landslide susceptibility. Each factor weight was determined by a back-propagation exercise. Landslide-susceptibility indices were calculated using the back-propagation weights, and susceptibility maps were constructed from GIS data. The susceptibility map was compared with known landslide locations and verified. The demonstrated prediction accuracy was 93. 20 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of sedimentation, depth and substratum angle on sponge assemblages in the Wakatobi region, south-eastern Sulawesi, Indonesia was considered. Sponge assemblages were sampled from two reef localities. The first reef (Sampela) was highly impacted by high sedimentation rates with fine sediment particles that settle slowly, {{while the second}} (Hoga) experienced only fast settling coarse sediment with lower overall sedimentation rates. Sponge assemblages were sampled (area occupied and numbers) on the reef fiat (0 m) and at 5 (reef crest), 10 and 15 m (15 m at Hoga only). Some significant (P 4. 61, df = 9, P < 0. 001) sponge numbers, percentage cover and richness {{were associated with the}} reef flat at both sites compared with all other depths at each site, with the exception of abundance of sponges on the reef flat at Sampela, which was much greater than at any other depth sampled. Species richness increased with depth at both sites but differences between surface angles were only recorded at Sampela, with higher species richness being found on vertical, inclined and horizontal surfaces respectively A total of 100 sponge species (total area sampled 52. 5 m(2)) was reported from the two sites, with 58 species found at Sampela and 71 species at Hoga (41 % of species shared). Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) indicated differences in assemblage structure between sites and most depth intervals, but not substratum angles. A number of biological (e. g. competition and predation) and physical (e. g. sedimentation and <b>aerial</b> exposure) <b>factors</b> were considered to control sponge abundance and richness. Unexpectedly a significant (F- 1,F- 169 = 148. 98, P < 0. 001) positive linear relationship was found between sponge density and area occupied. In areas of high sponge coverage, the number of patches was also high, possibly due to fragmentation of large sponges produced as a result of predation and physical disturbance. The MDS results were also the same whether sponge numbers or percentage cover estimates were used, suggesting that although these different approaches yield different sorts of information, the same assemblage structure can be identified...|$|R
40|$|Aerial seed {{banks are}} {{potentially}} {{the main source}} of sexual recruitment for woody wetland plants. Whilst the importance of soil seed banks for the persistence and recruitment of wetland plants has been examined in many studies, the role of aerial seed banks has been largely neglected. We used seed traps and the seedling emergence technique to quantify the seed rain from aerial seed banks of the Swamp Paperbark Melaleuca ericifolia Sm. (Myrtaceae) in Dowd Morass, a Ramsar-listed, brackish-water wetland in south-eastern Australia. Nine plant species germinated from material collected in seed traps over 2004 – 2005, but emergents were dominated (80 – 97 %) by M. ericifolia. The mean number of M. ericifolia emergents ranged from < 1 to < 100 seedlings m− 2 day− 1, and showed a peak in the summer–autumn period. Regression analysis showed a significant negative correlation (r 2 = 0. 738) between the number of M. ericifolia emergents and water depth. Water depth and salinity were negatively correlated (r 2 = 0. 819), and increases in the number of M. ericifolia emergents as water levels fell were also associated with high salinities. Increasing air temperature and vapour pressure deficit also stimulated seed release during periods of drying. This study {{is one of the first}} to demonstrate the importance of aerial seed banks for sexual recruitment in woody wetland plants and the release of seed in relation to environmental <b>factors.</b> <b>Aerial</b> seed banks warrant consideration alongside soil seed banks for the establishment and long-term survival of woody plants in wetlands...|$|R
40|$|Although most frog {{species are}} {{specialized}} for jumping or swimming, Kassina maculata (red-legged running frog) primarily uses a third type of locomotion {{during which the}} hindlimbs alternate. In the present study, we examined Kassina 2 ̆ 7 s distinct locomotory mode to determine whether these frogs walk or run and how their gait may change with speed. We used multiple methods to distinguish between terrestrial gaits: the existence or absence of an <b>aerial</b> phase, duty <b>factor,</b> relative footfall patterns and {{the mechanics of the}} animal 2 ̆ 7 s center of mass (COM). To measure kinematic and kinetic variables, we recorded digital video as the animals moved over a miniature force platform (N= 12 individuals). With respect to footfall patterns, the frogs used a single gait and walked at all speeds examined. Duty factor always exceeded 0. 59. Based on COM mechanics, however, the frogs used both walking and running gaits. At slower speeds, the fluctuations in the horizontal kinetic energy (Ek) and gravitational potential energy (Ep) of the COM were largely out of phase, indicating a vaulting or walking gait. In most of the trials, Kassina used a combined gait at intermediate speeds, unlike cursorial animals with distinct gait transitions. This combined gait, much like a mammalian gallop, exhibited the mechanics of both vaulting and bouncing gaits. At faster speeds, the Ek and Ep of Kassina 2 ̆ 7 s COM were more in phase, indicating the use of a bouncing or running gait. Depending on the definition used to distinguish between walking and running, Kassina either only used a walking gait at all speeds or used a walking gait at slower speeds but then switched to a running gait as speed increased...|$|R
40|$|Sprengen" are {{water courses}} dug ages ago to {{discharge}} groundwater from the Veluwe hills, where natural vegetation has always prevailed. An investigation in 1996, comprising sampling of sprengen and groundwater in the surroundings, {{was aimed at}} studying the relationship between precipitation, groundwater and {{the water from the}} sprengen. The concentrations of the major components and of micro-components in the water were considered. Investigations carried out to study residence times of the water in the soil revealed the extent of the drainage basins and produced values for net precipitation. Discharge of the sprengen is relatively constant in time. Concentrations of the major components are related to the aerial deposition, taking into account travel times in the soil and condensation <b>factors.</b> <b>Aerial</b> deposition is the only source for the major components in the eastern sprengen. Nitrate concentrations in the sprengen result from the total deposition of nitrogen compounds, but 77 % vanishes through denitrification in the soil. They have increased from 0. 3 to roughly 5 and they will further increase to 10 mg. l- 1 in the coming century, if the aerial deposition remains the same. Sulphate concentrations result from aerial deposition of sulphur. The groundwater acidity has decreased from pH= 6. 5 to now pH= 5. 5 and it will further decrease to pH= 4. 5 at an unchanged aerial deposition in the coming century. Increased concentrations in groundwater and/or the southern sprengen of B, Al, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, As, Rb, Y, Cd, Cs and Ba probably result from an additional load at land surface. The lantanide concentrations increase roughly at low pH values by a factor of 10 (when compared to a former situation) by dissolution in soil. The same results were obtained with aluminium...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} preventive aerial coyote hunting as a depredation management technique, I compared sheep {{losses to}} coyote (Canis latransl predation and {{the hours of}} corrective predation management required on summer grazing areas with and without hunting the prior winter from helicopters. Correlations were used to test for relationships between the extent, intensity, and timing of aerial hunting and lamb losses to coyote predation. Data on the age, sex, and reproductive status of coyotes killed using aerial hunting, traps, snares, and calling-and-shooting were used to test for differential coyote vulnerability to damage management tools, and {{to assess the impact}} of aerial hunting on coyote populations. Winter aerial hunting reduced confirmed and estimated lamb losses to coyote predation and the hours of effort required for corrective predation management the subsequent summer. Aerial hunting increased the number of coyotes killed annually per grazing area, but did not reduce summer coyote removal. There were no consistent relationships between the extent, intensity, or timing of aerial hunting and sheep losses to coyote predation. The male: female ratio for coyotes captured with calling-and-shooting was higher than that for traps or aerial hunting. More juvenile coyotes were killed with aerial hunting than with traps or shooting. However, there was no difference in the age of adult coyotes 3 ̆e 1. 5 years old) removed using any control method or between the age of coyotes from areas with and without consistent <b>aerial</b> hunting. Confounding <b>factors</b> in the data and the high number of uncontrolled variables prohibited clear identification of the mechanism making aerial hunting effective. I also examined financial compensation programs as an alternative to lethal control. Nineteen states and 7 Canadian provinces had compensation programs. Compensation programs appeared to be established when wildlife problems were of recent origin, resulted from government actions, and/or were caused by highly valued species. Compensation programs for coyote damage had been established in 4 states/provinces in eastern North America where coyotes are a new problem, but are unlikely to be a acceptable tool for the western U.

Seu objetivo principal foi avaliar caracter?sticas intr?nsecas dos horizontes de intemperismo da Forma??o Alter do Ch?o, que se acham sob {{a capital}} amazonense, analisando seus atributos f?sicos e mineral?gicos, bem como sua descri??o t?til visual; al?m disso, buscou-se avaliar o risco geol?gico, as caracter?sticas ex?genas como a pluviosidade, a antropiza??o e a evolu??o da paisagem local, para tanto, utilizaram-se imagens de sat?lite e a?reas, correlacionando esses fatores com o desenvolvimento de fei??es erosivas encontradas em duas ?reas de estudos: a primeira ?rea, localizada no bairro Jorge Teixeira, na comunidade Jo?o Paulo e a segunda, localizada no bairro Cidade Nova, entre as comunidades Conjunto Cidad?o I e Campo Dourado I, respectivamente, nas zonas leste e norte da cidade. A metodologia aplicada consistiu no levantamento bibliogr?fico; an?lises de mapas-base; imagens de sat?lite e fotografias a?reas; investiga??o de campo com descri??o e hierarquiza??o dos setores de risco geol?gico; ensaios em campo com coleta de amostras por sondagem a trado; an?lises f?sicas por ensaios de granulometria e limites de consist?ncia, e ensaios mineral?gicos por difra??o de raios-x. As imagens a?reas e de sat?lites, aqui analisadas, foram capturadas entre os anos de 2004 a 2013. Na primeira ?rea, as vo?orocas nos finais dos arruamentos j? estavam bem evolu?das nas imagens de 2004; at? 2007, percebe-se a evolu??o principalmente lateral das bordas das vo?orocas; nas imagens de 2010 e 2011, percebe-se uma boa recupera??o da vegeta??o; j? na imagem de 2013, diminui??o da atividade de eros?o, poucos deslizamentos das bordas s?o notados. Na segunda ?rea, em 2004, observa-se a implanta??o do Conjunto Cidad?o I, com infraestrutura e planejamento; ap?s 2007, algumas casas s?o retiradas do sop? da encosta, e, nas imagens seguintes, de 2010, 2011 e 2013, a encosta aparece em franca recupera??o da vegeta??o. No mapeamento em risco, executado em campo na 1 ? ?rea, verificam-se setores de risco alto a muito alto, com v?rias moradias pr?ximas ?s vo?orocas; na 2 ? ?rea temos apenas um setor em risco alto de soterramento, no sop? da encosta, pr?ximo a fei??es erosivas menores. Sondagens a trado de 10 metros foram executadas para an?lise t?til visual e coleta de amostras. Os dados granulom?tricos, com c?lculos de coeficiente de curvatura, grau de uniformidade e dos ensaios de limites de consist?ncia, da 1 ? ?rea, indicam boa resist?ncia ? eros?o, por?m, nesse local distinguem-se grandes fei??es erosivas. Na 2 ? ?rea decorre uma menor influ?ncia antr?pica, sendo que os dados adquiridos nas an?lises t?m comportamento equivalente ao visto em campo.

Considering {{the proliferation of}} areas of geohazard in Manaus-AM, in the last decades, because of irregular and unplanned occupation, if stimulated this research which resulted in this master dissertation. The main objective is to evaluate intrinsic characteristics of weathering horizons of Alter do Ch?o Formation, which are under the city of Manaus, analyzing their physical and mineralogical properties and its visual tactile description, also evaluating the geohazard, exogenous characteristics such as rainfall, to anthropization {{and the evolution of}} the local landscape from imagery satellite and <b>aerial</b> correlating these <b>factors</b> with the development of erosional features found in two fields of study, the first study area located in the neighborhood Jorge Teixeira, in the community Jo?o Paulo, encompassing the late streets, the second area is located in the neighborhood Cidade Nova between the communities Conjunto Cidad?o I and Campo Dourado I. These areas are respectively the eastern and northern parts of the city. The methodology applied in this study consisted of in the bibliographical survey, analysis of base maps, satellite images and aerial photographs, field research with description and the hierarchization of geohazard sectors, characterization tests on field and samples collected by probing in auger, analyzes physical, by tests of the particle size and limits consistency and mineralogical assays by x-ray diffraction. Developments mainly lateral edges of the craters are analyzed aerial and satellite images between the years 2004 to 2013, the first area in the late gullies streets were already well evolved in pictures 2004 until 2007 he perceives the images 2010 and 2011 we see a good recovery of the vegetation and the image of 2013 gullies appear to be completely stagnant with vegetation recovered. In the second area in 2004 noted the implementation of the community Conjunto Cidad?o I, with infrastructure and planning, after 2007 some houses are removed from the foot of the slope, the following images 2010, 2011 and 2013 the slope appears to be safe with vegetation recovery. In geohazard mapping performed in the field in the 1 st district looked high and very high hazards sectors with several houses near of the gully, the 2 nd area have only one sector at high hazard for burial {{at the foot of the}} slope, near the lower erosional features. Soundings by auger of 10 meters were enforced in the two areas, for visual and tactile analysis with sample collection. Grain size data, with calculations of curvature coefficient, degree of uniformity and tests of consistency limits of the 1 st district indicate good resistance to erosion, but this site is great erosional features. In the 2 nd area for a smaller anthropogenic influences and the data acquired in the analyzes are equivalent to the behavior seen in the field, up to 6. 5 meters deep analysis showing good resistance to erosion of the layers, below that the erodibility of the material increases and features are observed erosive. The activities of endogenous and exogenous agents are different for each site studied. Mainly responsible for formation of gullies in the first area are exogenous agents added to anthropization and a lack of infrastructure. In the second area, the endogenous factors, the characteristics of the layers are decisive to indicate the most susceptible to erosion layers...|$|R
