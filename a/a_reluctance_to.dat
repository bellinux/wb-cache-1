Northern and eastern breeders are dependent on the cones of the Siberian stone pine, and if the crop fails many birds of the S.e.asiatica subspecies may move west into northern Sweden and Finland in autumn, sometimes staying to breed. Siberian S.e.arctica may make more limited movements south and east in winter, and S.e.amurensis, from southeast Russia, is regular in winter in Korea.|$|E
5|$|The Persian strategy, on {{the other}} hand, was {{probably}} principally determined by tactical considerations. The Persian infantry was evidently lightly armoured, and no match for hoplites in a head-on confrontation (as would be demonstrated at the later battles of Thermopylae and Plataea.) Since the Athenians seem to have taken up a strong defensive position at Marathon, the Persian hesitance was probably <b>a</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> attack the Athenians head-on.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be <b>a</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} to delve into the validity of the conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E

Changes in family size and the possibility of zoning changes to allow denser construction are some of the few influences that may affect population over time.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the economy}} of the Trafford {{dominated}} by agriculture. This continued to some extent even during the Industrial Revolution, as the textile industry in Trafford did not develop as quickly or to the same extent {{as it did in the}} rest of Greater Manchester. There are only two known 18th-century mill sites in Trafford, compared with 69 known in Tameside and 51 in Manchester. After reaching a high of 43% in 1812, employment in the textile industry in Trafford declined to 12% according to the 1851 census. The textile industry in Trafford could not compete with that in places such as Manchester, Oldham, and Ashton-under-Lyne, partly because of <b>a</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> invest in industry on the part of the two main land owners in the area: the Stamfords and the de Traffords.|$|E
5|$|Infighting between Barclay's {{subordinates}} repeatedly {{prevented the}} Russian commander from committing his forces to battle. Barclay's fellow generals and the Russian court viewed the constant retreat as <b>a</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> fight; consequently, he {{was removed from}} command and replaced by Prince Mikhail Kutuzov on 29 August 1812. Although the 67-year-old General Kutuzov was not seen by his contemporaries as the equal of Napoleon, he possessed the ability to muster a good defence. He was favoured over Barclay because he was Russian whereas Barclay was of Scottish descent and officers subordinate to Barclay could accept Kutuzov, thereby uniting the army. On 18 August Kutuzov arrived at Sarevo to greet the army.|$|E

5|$|While {{the swift}} {{transfer}} of power following Domitian's death had prevented a civil war from erupting, Nerva's position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable, and his benign nature turned into <b>a</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> assert his authority. Upon his accession, he had ordered a halt to treason trials, {{but at the same}} time allowed the prosecution of informers by the Senate to continue. This measure led to , as everyone acted in his own interests while trying to settle scores with personal enemies, leading the consul Fronto to famously remark that Domitian's tyranny was ultimately preferable to Nerva's anarchy. Early in 97, a conspiracy led by the senator Gaius Calpurnius Piso Crassus Frugi Licinianus failed, but once again Nerva refused to put the conspirators to death, much to the disapproval of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Although the country's {{reliance}} on foreign workers {{has been a}} concern to the Saudi government since the mid-1950s, the situation has persisted because of a reluctance by Saudis to take on menial work and a shortage of Saudi candidates for skilled jobs. This has, in part, been blamed on the Saudi education system, which {{has been criticized for}} its emphasis on religion and rote learning. The Saudi economy has, therefore, remained dependent on Westerners for expertise in specialised industries and on the Asian workforce for the construction industry as well as for menial and unskilled tasks. In response, since 1995 the Saudi government has initiated a policy of Saudization, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals. For example, in 2000, it was decreed that the work force of businesses with more than 20 employees must be at least 25 per cent Saudi. In the private sector, there has been <b>a</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> employ Saudis and Saudization is generally considered to have been a failure. Saudis themselves may be unwilling to take certain jobs, considering them to lack social value.|$|E
5|$|Further reviews came in {{this time}} as Defence {{planners}} attempted {{to grapple with the}} questions regarding strategy following the wars of diplomacy of the previous three decades. The emergence of the Defence of Australia doctrine as the foundation upon which Australian defence policy would be based following Paul Dibb's 1986 review of Australia's defence capabilities seemed to provide the Reserves with a definite role. Nevertheless, there remained <b>a</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> rebuild the Reserves and despite these major reviews, as late as the 1990s the Army still had not managed to develop a well-structured reserve force, as it had continued to grapple with the competing demands of maintaining large-scale general readiness over developing a 'hard core' of capability within the Reserves that would be able to provide the Army with a nucleus force in times of national emergency.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, Sleaford's {{population}} more than doubled from 1,596 in 1801 to 3,539 in 1851. Coinciding with this is the construction or extension of public buildings, often by the local contractors Charles Kirk and Thomas Parry. The gasworks opened in 1839 to provide gas lighting in the town. Sleaford's Poor Law Union was formed in 1836 to cater for the town and the surrounding 54 parishes. The workhouse was constructed by 1838 and could house 181 inmates. Despite these advances, the slums around Westgate were over-crowded, lacking sanitation and disease-ridden; the local administration failed to deal with the matter until 1850, when a report on the town's public health by the General Board of Health heavily criticised the situation and set up a Local Board of Health to undertake public works. By the 1880s, Lord Bristol had allowed clean water to be pumped into the town, but engineering problems and <b>a</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> sell land to house the turbines had delayed the introduction of sewers.|$|E
5|$|Overseas, The Dark Knight is the highest-{{grossing}} 2008 {{film and}} the fourth-highest-grossing superhero film. It premiered in 20 other territories on 4,520 screens, grossing $41.3million {{in its first}} weekend. The film came second to Hancock, which was screening in 71 territories in its third weekend. The Dark Knights biggest territory was Australia, where it grossed $13.7million over the weekend, setting a record for the largest superhero film opening. It topped the weekend box office outside North America three consecutive times and four in total. Citing cultural sensitivities to some elements in the film, and <b>a</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> adhere to pre-release conditions, Warner Bros. declined to release the film in mainland China. Its highest-grossing market after North America was the UK, Ireland, and Malta, where it earned $89.1 million. Also, in Australia, it earned of $39.9 million, still remaining in the all-time Top 10 of the country. The five highest-grossing markets outside North America also include Germany ($29.7 million), France and the Maghreb region ($27.5 million) and South Korea ($25.0 million).|$|E
5|$|The {{educational}} opportunities for secondary modern pupils were limited compared to those at grammar schools, prompting criticism of the selection system; grammar schools and the eleven plus were also criticised for alienating working-class families. <b>A</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> improve secondary moderns or expand grammar schools under the Conservatives prompted the Labour Government to issue Circular 10/65 in 1965 which requested local education authorities convert to a comprehensive system. In 1971, Sleaford parents voted in favour of comprehensive education, but rejected the Council's proposals. New plans were unveiled in 1973: the High School and the Secondary Modern sites were to become mixed 11–16 schools and Carre's would become a sixth form college. Parents voted for the plans (1,199 to 628), albeit with a 50% turnout. The County Council approved them, but allowed governors a veto. Following negotiations with governors at Carre's, the scheme was revised in 1974 so that Carre's and the High School became 11–18 schools; the secondary modern would be closed, Westholme absorbed by the High School and the Church Lane site by Carre's.|$|E

5|$|Troglita now {{moved his}} army {{to confront the}} enemy, who were encamped at a plain called the Fields of Cato. The Moorish camp had been heavily fortified, and Troglita was {{reluctant}} to launch a direct assault. He therefore blockaded it, hoping that hunger would force the Moors to fight him in open battle. To further encourage them, he restrained his men, feigning <b>a</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> fight. Troglita's plan worked: encouraged by sacrifices to their gods and hoping to catch the imperial army unprepared, the Moors attacked the Byzantine camp on a Sunday. The battle hung long in the balance, with many dead on both sides, but eventually the Byzantines gained the upper hand. At this point, Carcasan rallied his forces and launched a fierce counterattack, but was killed by Troglita himself. Seeing their leader fall, the Moors broke and fled. The battle was a resounding success for the Byzantines: seventeen of the Moors' principal leaders were dead, the Tripolitanian tribes were decimated and withdrew to the desert, and Antalas and his followers submitted to Troglita. Byzacena, Numidia, and Tripolitania were finally secured, and a period of peace was inaugurated that lasted for the next fourteen years, until 562.|$|E
5|$|Arrangements for naval gunfire {{support to}} the landings, had {{originally}} included bombarding the beaches and approaches but was changed to engagement of the ridges during the landings, with the beaches only to be shelled prior to the landings. No decision was ultimately made {{on the issue of}} close-support, and it was left up to the initiative of individual ships' captains. <b>A</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> approach the shore later impacted on landings at 'V' and 'W' beach where some of the heaviest losses among the infantry occurred, while naval gunfire was of some assistance at 'S', 'X' and Anzac. Even then its effectiveness was limited by the initial confusion ashore, the broken terrain, thick vegetation, and the lack of observation. Kitchener had ruled that air requirements must be met by the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and the Allies employed a small force of seaplanes and other aircraft from 3 Squadron, RNAS (Commander Charles Samson) which arrived at Tenedos at the end of March. The aircraft were unopposed by the small Ottoman air force at first and during the planning, the force had been used to provide aerial reconnaissance, although this ultimately proved inadequate to meet the Allies' intelligence needs and make up for the lack of adequate maps. After the landings, Allied aircraft conducted photographic reconnaissance, observed naval gunfire, reported on Ottoman troop movements and conducted a small number of bombing raids.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus was {{at first}} {{occupied}} {{by the threat of}} the Parthians, with whom Rome had been at war since the reign of Caracalla. Macrinus settled a peace deal with the Parthians, after fighting an indecisive battle at Nisibis in 217. In return for peace, Macrinus was forced to pay a large indemnity to the Parthian ruler Artabanus V. Rome was at the time also under threat from Dacia and Armenia, so any deal with Parthia would likely have been beneficial to Rome. Next, Macrinus turned his attention to Armenia. In 216, Caracalla had imprisoned Khosrov I of Armenia and his family after Khosrov had agreed to meet with Caracalla at a conference to discuss some issue between himself and his sons. Caracalla instead installed a new Roman governor to rule over Armenia. These actions angered the Armenian peoples and they soon rebelled against Rome. Macrinus settled a peace treaty with them by returning the crown and loot to Khosrov's son and successor Tiridates II and releasing his mother from prison, and by restoring Armenia to its status as a client kingdom of Rome. Macrinus made peace with the Dacians by releasing hostages, though this was likely not handled by himself but by Marcius Agrippa. In matters of foreign policy, Macrinus showed a tendency towards settling disputes through diplomacy and <b>a</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>to</b> engage in military conflict, though this may have been due to lack of resources and manpower than his own personal preference.|$|E
