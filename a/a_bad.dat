5000|$|Kathryn and Stuart {{have been}} {{creating}} various webcomics alongside their print work for Marvel comics. Their first webcomic was Never <b>As</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>As</b> You Think, which eventually got published by Boom! Studios in December 2008. The webcomic {{was followed by}} Moving Pictures, which saw a print publication by Top Shelf Productions in April 2010. The latter webcomic took on a darker tone than the humorous Never <b>As</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>As</b> You Think, taking place in 1940s France during World War II and starring a Nazi protagonist. The A.V. Club described Moving Pictures as [...] "illustrative of what a major writing talent Immonen really is." ...|$|R

5|$|A {{central part}} of the show's premise was that the main {{character}} would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained {{that he did not want}} the character to be that young.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} after {{settling}} down in Berlin, Accum had a house built at 16 Marienstraße (later 21 Marienstraße), where he dwelt until his death. During his last years, he suffered from <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> case of gout, which ultimately led to his death. His illness took a serious {{turn for the worse}} in June 1838, and he rapidly deteriorated. On June 28, approximately 16 years after he return to Germany, Accum {{died at the age of}} 69 in Berlin. He was buried there at the Dorotheenstädtischen Friedhof.|$|E
5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The question {{is only one of}} limits: how far to go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be <b>a</b> <b>bad,</b> even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, may be related to Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E

5|$|Allardyce {{departed}} {{the club}} on in January 2008 {{by mutual consent}} after <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> start to the 2007–08 season, and Kevin Keegan was reappointed as Newcastle manager. Mort stepped down as chairman in June {{and was replaced by}} Derek Llambias, a long-term associate of Ashley. Newcastle finished the 2007–08 season in twelfth place, but as the season drew to a close, Keegan publicly criticised the board, claiming they were not providing the team enough financial support.|$|E
5|$|Although {{signed by}} Pierce and Santa Anna, the treaty needed a 2/3 {{vote in favor}} of {{ratification}} in the US Senate, where it met strong opposition.

5|$|Another song {{sequence}} ("Suraj Hua Maddham") involving Khan and Kajol {{was shot}} with {{the backdrop of}} the Pyramids of Giza in the city of Cairo in Egypt. Due to the lighting conditions, the crew could shoot only between 7 and 9am in the morning. As a result, the song took several days to film. In addition, Kajol suffered from a minor injury while filming for the song, as she had experienced <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> fall.|$|E

The September tournament {{unfolded}} in a similarly poor fashion. After compiling a lacklustre 5–4 record through the first nine days, Asashōryū forfeited his tenth-day match to maegashira Gōeidō and withdrew. He had elbow pain, and presented a medical certificate.|$|E

The Thompson Block suffered <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> fire early in the morning on September 23, 2009, and the temporary supports reaching into adjacent streets, installed shortly after the fire to stabilize the structure, blocked westbound traffic on Cross Street for more than three months and have resulted in legal tussles between the city and the property owner.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Mühe was married to his third wife, stage actress Susanne Lothar, and living in Berlin with her and their two children, Sophie Marie and Jakob. Mühe and Lothar starred {{together}} in Mühe's last film, Nemesis (2010), which deals with a couple's troubled relationship. However, Lothar, who died in 2012, launched a lawsuit to block the film from release for nearly three years, apparently because she felt that it would cast the couple in <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> light.|$|E
5|$|Banagher has a {{thriving}} poetry scene {{and an annual}} poetry festival called Readings from the Pallet takes place in local bars. The town {{was one of the}} settings for the series Pure Mule, as featured on RTÉ television. The mini-series was an RTÉ production and shot in 2005 in Banagher, Birr and Tullamore. The series was favourably received by the critics, although some locals maintain that it portrays Midlanders in <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> light. The series won four IFTA awards in 2005.|$|E
5|$|By Justinian's time, {{the scheme}} was simpler: instead of {{complementing}} actions for manifest and non-manifest theft, handling stolen goods, or concealing them made one instead liable for non-manifest theft, whose two-times penalty was maintained.
