5|$|The victorious allies regrouped, {{although}} {{too slowly}} to intercept Rupert <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> York. Once the allied army had reformed (and had {{been joined by}} Meldrum's and Denbigh's forces) they resumed the siege of York. Without hope of relief, and under the agreement that no Scottish soldiers were to be quartered in the city, the garrison surrendered on honourable terms on 16 July.|$|E
5|$|At 3:21 of the 1st round, after Wanderlei flurried {{and missed}} a punch {{with his right}} hand, Jackson countered with a left hook on Silva's jaw, sending the latter on to the canvas and {{rendering}} him unconscious. Jackson followed with three punches to Silva's head on the ground, two of which occurred after referee Yves Lavigne attempted to halt the contest. Wanderlei remained on the canvas for several moments, but appeared to be OK <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the cage under his own power.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Mugabe survived two {{assassination}} attempts. In the first, {{which took}} place on 6 February, a grenade was thrown at his Mount Pleasant home, where it exploded against a garden wall. In the second, on 10 February, a roadside bomb exploded near his motorcade <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> a Fort Victoria rally. Mugabe himself was unharmed. Mugabe accused the Rhodesian security forces of being responsible for these attacks. In an attempt to quell the possibility that Rhodesia's security forces would launch a coup to prevent the election, Mugabe met with Peter Walls, the commander of Rhodesia's armed forces, {{and asked him to}} remain in his position {{in the event of a}} ZANU-PF victory. At the time Walls refused.|$|E

5|$|On 20 May 2009, {{following}} 8 {{years of}} distinguished service, Billy retired {{due to his}} age. Soldiers from the battalion lined the route from his pen to the trailer <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the camp for the last time, in ceremonial dress that included a silver headdress which {{was a gift from}} the queen in 1955. Billy was taken to Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire, where keepers say he had an easy life at the Children's Farm.|$|E

5|$|Reamon, who {{had helped}} guide Brooks from Newport News to the University of Virginia, helped Michael with his SATs and helped {{him and his family}} choose between Syracuse University and Virginia Tech. Reamon favored Virginia Tech, where he felt better {{guidance}} was available under Frank Beamer, who promised to redshirt him and provide the freshman needed time to develop. Reamon sold Michael on the school's proximity to family and friends, and Vick chose to attend Virginia Tech. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the Newport News public housing projects in 1998 with a college football scholarship in hand, Vick was seen in the Newport News community as a success story.|$|E
5|$|The FBB {{closed the}} Security Zone checkpoints, {{but by then}} Stauffenberg's car had been let through two of them <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the area. Contrary to the imposed {{security}} doctrines in place, Stauffenberg and his adjutant were able {{to pass through the}} closed Security Zone 3 checkpoint and proceed to the airport for the flight to Berlin. They succeeded in getting away before clarity of the events could be established by the military and security personnel at the Wolf's Lair complex.|$|E

5|$|The reigns {{of most of}} the Angevin monarchs were {{marred by}} civil strife and {{conflicts}} between the monarch and the nobility. Henry II faced rebellions from his own sons, the future monarchs Richard I and John. Nevertheless, Henry managed to expand his kingdom, forming what is retrospectively known as the Angevin Empire. Upon Henry's death, his elder son Richard succeeded to the throne; he was absent from England for most of his reign, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> to fight in the Crusades.

5|$|When Said bin Taimur of Oman {{was ousted}} in a coup in July 1970 and {{replaced}} with his son Qaboos bin Said, he was sent in exile and lived at the Dorchester {{until his death in}} 1972. The McAlpine family owned the hotel until 1977 when they sold it to a consortium of businessmen from the Middle East headed by the Sultan of Brunei. On 3 June 1982, Shlomo Argov, the Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom was shot and seriously injured in an assassination attempt <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the Dorchester. The attack was the immediate cause for the 1982 Lebanon War.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{casualties}} of the Army of the North were not substantial, {{it was left}} demoralized and disbanded. Goyeneche pursued the fleeing patriots, and captured Huaqui after his victory. The inhabitants of Upper Peru welcomed the royalists back, so the army had to quickly leave those provinces. However, the resistance of Cochabamba prevented the royalists from proceeding to Buenos Aires. Castelli moved to the post of Quirbe, and received orders to return to Buenos Aires for trial. However, {{by the time he}} was notified, new orders had been issued: Castelli should be confined at Catamarca, while Saavedra himself took charge of the Army of the North. Saavedra was deposed as soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> Buenos Aires, and was confined to San Juan. The First Triumvirate, which had commenced governing by then, required Castelli to return.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{five minutes}} into the third quarter, Namath forged another Jets drive, {{following}} an interception by safety Jim Hudson, that ended with halfback Bill Mathis scoring a 4-yard touchdown behind blocking guard Dave Herman to give New York a 19–14 lead. The Raiders responded with an 80-yard drive that saw running back Charlie Smith score his first touchdown of the game on a 3-yard pass from Lamonica. The Raiders took a 22–19 lead on a two-point conversion with Lamonica completing the attempt to receiver Hewritt Dixon. During this drive, Hudson was ejected from the game after being called for a face mask penalty followed by a dispute with an official. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the field, he gave the jeering crowd the finger. The penalties caused the ball to be placed at the Jets' 3-yard line, and Smith scored for Oakland one play later.|$|E
5|$|As the {{sun rose}} at 04:00 on 2 August, firing broke out once again between the French {{southern}} division of Guillaume Tell, Tonnant, Généreux and Timoléon and the battered Alexander and Majestic. Although briefly outmatched, the British ships were soon joined by Goliath and Theseus. As Captain Miller manoeuvred his ship into position, Theseus briefly came under fire from the frigate Artémise. Miller turned his ship towards Artémise, but Captain Pierre-Jean Standelet struck his flag and ordered his men to abandon the frigate. Miller sent a boat under Lieutenant William Hoste to take possession of the empty vessel, but Standelet had set fire to his ship <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> and Artémise blew up shortly afterwards. The surviving French ships of the line, covering their retreat with gunfire, gradually pulled to the east away from the shore at 06:00. Zealous pursued, {{and was able to}} prevent the frigate Justice from boarding Bellerophon, which was anchored at the southern point of the bay undergoing hasty repairs.|$|E
