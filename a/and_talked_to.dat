5|$|Rodriquez had {{initially}} refused {{to audition for}} the series as {{he wanted to be}} a part of the 2000 drama The Street instead. After being contacted repeatedly by All Souls producers, he read for the parts of Fortado and Sterling; he had to go through the lines a total of five times. During the audition, he met <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Aaron Spelling. After failing to be cast in The Street, Rodriquez committed to portraying Fortado. He said that his main attraction to the television project was the ability to work on a show produced by Spelling. While filming the episodes in a wheelchair, Rodriquez said that he gained an increased awareness and appreciation for handicapped people.|$|E

Immediate reactions <b>to</b> team monitoring <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the room were investigated by means of lag sequential analysis. As expected, we found that in high performing teams, immediate consequences of team monitoring were speaking-up and providing unsolicited assistance. <b>Talking</b> <b>to</b> the room led <b>to</b> further <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the room <b>and</b> substituted explicit coordination. The results highlight the relevance of team monitoring <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the room for team coordination and performance in dynamic healthcare environments...|$|R

5|$|Victoria was, however, less {{enthusiastic}} about fulfilling her public role. She avoided answering letters, put off visits to elderly relations whose company {{she did not}} enjoy, <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> people who amused her at official functions while ignoring people of higher standing whom she found boring. Victoria's inattention to her duties provoked quarrels with Ernst. The young couple had loud, physical fights. The volatile Victoria shouted, threw tea trays, smashed china against the wall, and tossed anything that was handy at Ernst during their arguments. Victoria sought relief in her love for horses and long gallops over the countryside on a hard-to-control stallion named Bogdan. While she was in Russia for the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II, Victoria's affection for Kirill was also rekindled. She enjoyed flirting {{with him at the}} balls and celebrations that marked the coronation.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, {{two members}} of the Security Committee of the Czech Parliament visited Uherský Brod <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{multiple}} witnesses. The MPs issued a report condemning handling of the situation by the police. Among other issues, the MPs criticized that policemen parked their cars and put bullet proof vests on within the shooting range of the attacker, initially failed to get information from the witnesses and only later during the intervention attempted to contact them, didn't cover the back exit and thus potentially allowed the perpetrator {{to get out of the}} object and jeopardize other people. The police even let a helicopter land within the shooting range of the attacker. According to MPs, the police left much to be desired in regards of communication and most importantly, they wrongly decided to believe the perpetrator's claim of having hostage even though the witnesses could have readily confirmed that everyone inside was most likely dead. The policemen didn't seal the vicinity of the attack until 1pm and used civilian phones in communication with superior officers instead of using either their own phones or radio transmitters. Minister of Interior Chovanec commented that the MPs failed to interview the policemen and thus didn't get all the relevant information.|$|E
5|$|Following {{rumors of}} cast members from Beverly Hills, 90210 {{appearing}} on the spin-off, The CW confirmed that Shannen Doherty, Jennie Garth, Tori Spelling and Joe E. Tata would be returning in recurring roles as their original characters. Sachs was familiar with Garth, <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her about a possible role in the series. Garth agreed to star on the series without reading a script after brainstorming ideas with Sachs. The producers offered Garth a role as a series regular, but she opted to sign on as a recurring character. Doherty decided to appear after talking with Sachs, but her appearance {{was moved to the}} second episode. Sachs described Tata's casting as an accident; a friend told Sachs that he had seen Tata in a store, which led to the offer of a recurring role in the series. Sachs said that Tata was ecstatic about the idea and agreed. After reading the script, Spelling expressed interest in returning, and the writers decided to give her character her own fashion line. Spelling was scheduled to appear in the premiere, but due to personal reasons and the birth of her daughter, she opted to appear later in the season. On August 11, it was reported that Spelling had pulled out of the series after discovering that she was receiving less pay than Garth and Doherty. Spelling asked for her salary of $20,000 per episode to be increased to match their salaries—$40,000 to $50,000 per episode—but when denied she left the show altogether.|$|E

The dossier supports {{the view of the}} US embassy in Colombo that the senior military and civilian leaders were responsible for these crimes. The dossier urges the German government to investigate Dias' individual criminal responsibility, withdraw his diplomatic visa and declare him persona non grata.|$|E

25|$|Immediately after Savile's death, Meirion Jones and Liz Mackean {{from the}} BBC {{programme}} Newsnight began to investigate {{reports that he}} had sexually abused children. They interviewed one alleged victim on camera <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{a number of others}} who were willing to be quoted about alleged abuse at Duncroft Approved School near London, the BBC, and Stoke Mandeville hospital. The headmistress of Duncroft was Meirion Jones's own aunt, Margaret Jones. The Newsnight team, which included former police detective Mark Williams-Thomas, also found out about the Surrey police investigation into Savile. The report was scheduled for broadcast on 7 December 2011, but a decision was taken to cancel its transmission, which ultimately developed into a major crisis for the BBC when the ITV documentary was screened in October 2012. The subsequent Pollard Review found that Jones and MacKean assembled cogent evidence that Savile had a history of abusing young women and Newsnight {{was in a position to}} break the story in 2011. No mention of the dropped Newsnight report was made in public at the time.|$|E
