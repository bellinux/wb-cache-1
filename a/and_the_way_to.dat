5|$|Over {{much of her}} childhood, Michelena’s parents toured {{with the}} Emma Abbott Grand Opera Company a {{traveling}} theatre company that performed famous operas translated to English for American audiences. Beatriz's father in later life taught music {{and worked as a}} vocal coach and, {{at the time of his}} death, was serving as president of Arrillaga Musical College, San Francisco. Beatriz and her sister Vera were trained by their father in classical voice and drama studies, and they followed in his footsteps by beginning singing careers of their own. Vera first appeared onstage in the Princess Chic Opera company (1901) at 17, taking a leading role in The Man from China (1904). Beatriz, too, performed with Princess Chic in 1901, taking chorus roles suitable for a child of 11. By mid-1904, with Vera busy pursuing her career in New York, Fernando Michelena settled in San Francisco, California to teach voice. There, he raised Beatriz and continued to train her, a soprano, in operatic vocal techniques. He passed his stage experience to his daughter: the way to move as another person, the way to make simple but authoritative gestures, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> build intensity over the span of a performance. Maria Antonia Field, a Californian writer, would later chronicle her time as a student of Michelena’s father in her book, Five Years of Vocal Study under Fernando Michelena.|$|E

In the Poonch valley, the state forces retreated into towns where they were besieged.|$|E

Crew also discussed that the clouds were moving, so in next 10 minutes needed to reach the airfield, the clouds would have moved off the airfield. They also seemed to have a doubt whether the returns being picked up on the weather radar were ground echoes or were severe weather (Magenta) indications. The co-pilot confirmed that the returns were not ground echoes but were radar returns (Magenta) from very severe weather.|$|E

500|$|As of 2010, the Conservancy was {{undertaking}} several {{programs to}} help breeders and the public understand the need for <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> preserve heritage breeds. As the number of expert livestock breeders continues to dwindle, the Master Breeders' Apprentice Program aims to supplement their number by educating competent and interested members of the public. Through the Breed Rescue and Conservation Acquisition Program, the organization works with breeders and breed registries to begin and sustain conservation programs for rare livestock breeds. The Southeastern Livestock Breed Initiative aims to expand and reintroduce rare breeds from the American southeast, combining traditional breeds with low-impact farming (agriculture that has a lesser {{impact on the environment}} than high-intensity commercial farming) to assist in restarting the small, niche market farming that once existed in the area. [...] In 2014, the Conservancy published the book An Introduction to Heritage Breeds describing conserving and care of animals under the purview of the organization, detailing each breed's specific needs and characteristics.|$|E
500|$|In 1941 Holloway took a {{character}} part in Gabriel Pascal's film of Bernard Shaw's Major Barbara, {{in which he}} played a policeman. He had leading parts in later films, including The Way Ahead (1944), This Happy Breed (1944) <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>to</b> the Stars (1945). [...] After the war, he played Albert Godby in Brief Encounter and had a cameo role as the First Gravedigger in Laurence Olivier's 1948 film of Hamlet. In 1951 Holloway played the same role on the stage to the Hamlet of Alec Guinness. For Pathé News, he delivered the commentary for documentaries in a series called Time To Remember, where he narrated over old newsreels from significant dates in history from 1915 to 1942. [...] Holloway also starred {{in a series of}} films for Ealing Studios, beginning with Champagne Charlie in 1944 alongside Tommy Trinder.

500|$|Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra had {{disagreements}} {{about the}} events of the May Revolution <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> run the government; their disputes became public shortly after the creation of the Junta. Saavedra was the president, and Moreno was a secretary with the support of other vocal members. Ignacio Núñez describes how Morenists felt that the President was attempting to restore in his office the authority of the viceroys, thus downgrading the importance of {{the other members of the}} Junta at public events; while Saavedrists considered that the Secretary was overstepping his authority and did not allow even the appointment of a janitor that was not of his liking. However, Domingo Matheu would clarify in his memoirs that their initial concerns with Saavedra were based more on his desire for honours and privileges than for a real power struggle. Núñez described how Moreno was resisted by some criollos who initially supported the revolution without being aware of the long-term consequences. He was resisted by criollos alarmed by his straightforward way of talking about concepts like self-determination, tyranny, slavery, and freedom. Theologians resented that Moreno cited authors like Rousseau, Voltaire, or Montesquieu rather than Christian philosophers like Saint Augustine or Saint Thomas. He was also resisted by conservative lawyers and by most of the [...] military.|$|E

500|$|Michael Schur {{said another}} {{goal of the}} third season was to better {{demonstrate}} the comedic abilities of Rashida Jones, whose Ann Perkins character had often been portrayed as a straight man role to the other characters. This was done by placing Jones in a romantic relationship with Rob Lowe's character Chris Traeger, who is so overly-optimistic and seemingly-perfect that Ann has trouble finding any flaws and is taken aback by him. Schur said: [...] "Rashida is a very intelligent and attractive woman, and it's hard to knock someone like that off balance. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> knock that person off balance is to get Rob Lowe {{in a relationship with}} you." [...] Ann is further taken out of her element when it is revealed in [...] "Indianapolis" [...] that Chris broke up with her, but did so in such a positive and upbeat way that Ann did not realize it for several days. Afterward, Ann continues to move away her previous straight man role by going on a string of dates with many random men. During the final episodes of the season, Ann takes a part-time job at city hall as the health department public relations director, which Schur described as [...] "the natural full circle {{from the beginning of the}} season". This marked her process of getting over Chris and becoming a [...] "more mature person". Schur also said having Ann work at city hall would make it easier to integrate her into storylines with the other characters.|$|E
500|$|Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur said Chris' {{habit of}} {{pointing}} {{directly into the}} faces of people he meets and repeating their names {{was one of the}} first elements of his character that the writing staff conceived. Chris' desire to live 150 years was inspired by Schur's wife, J. J. Philbin, who had read an article which stated that scientists believe the first human who will live 150 years has already been born, and felt it applied to the Chris Traeger character. Lowe's first day of filming on the series was his birthday (March 17, 2010), which was the day his kiss scene with Rashida Jones in [...] "The Master Plan" [...] was shot. Lowe said he loved his character's [...] "unrelenting enthusiasm" [...] and the fact that he is not a romantic lead, but rather a [...] "big, fat nerd". Parks and Recreation star Amy Poehler said of Chris Traeger: [...] "It's a really fun character to play against because what you’ll see start to happen is Chris doesn’t want to deliver any bad news, but he’s actually like the Bad News Bear." [...] Like much of the rest of the cast, Lowe occasionally improvises lines and actions for his character that are not included in the script. The writers hoped to use Ann Perkins' breakup with Chris, and the drastic changes in her behavior afterward, as a way of tapping into more comedic potential of her character rather than having her fill the role of straight man as she had in the past. Schur said: [...] "Ann is a very intelligent and attractive woman, and it's hard to knock someone like that off balance. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> knock that person off balance is to get Rob Lowe in a relationship with you." ...|$|E

By autumn 1835, Bakunin had conceived of forming a philosophical circle in his home town of Pryamukhino. Moreover, by early 1836, Bakunin was back in Moscow, where he published translations of Fichte's Some Lectures Concerning the Scholar's Vocation <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>to</b> a Blessed Life, which became his favorite book.
