40|$|Bone {{plates are}} rarely used in avian {{fracture}} management for several reasons, and until recently, {{there was no}} plating system considered appropriate for use in birds with a body mass less than 500 g. To evaluate 3 different miniplate systems in avian fracture repair, 3 groups (A, B, and C) of 6 pigeons (Columba livia) each were used. The left ulna and radius of the pigeons were transected, and the ulna was stabilized. In group A, a 1. 3 -mm adaption plate was used. In group B, a limited contact system was created with washers that were placed between a 1. 3 -mm adaption plate and the bone. The intention was to reduce the compression of the periosteum and vascular damage to the bone. In group C, a 1. 0 -mm maxillofacial miniplate was used. Healing was evaluated with radiographs after 14 and 28 days. A flight test was conducted on day 28; the birds were then euthanatized, and the wing was dissected. Birds in group A with the <b>adaptation</b> <b>plate</b> achieved the best flight results (100 %). In group B birds, no effect of the limited contact concept was visible at necropsy, and {{a high percentage of}} the screws had loosened, leading to failure (33 %). The maxillofacial miniplates of group C birds were too weak and bent (100 %). These results indicate that the adaption plate 1. 3 met the desired requirements. To improve the system, further trials, with smaller drill bits and with screws having a smaller thread pitch, are recommended...|$|E
40|$|Fractures of {{the palate}} have defied {{conventional}} management, such that malrotation and disinclination of the palatal shelves {{occur in a}} significant number of patients after repair. The fractured palatal shelves of eight patients were first prealigned. To do so, one or more 205 -mm ratchet clamps and two intermaxillary fixation (IMF) posts were used. Rigid fixation was then achieved by applying a 2. 0 -mm mini-locking titanium plate (across the palatal vault) and by applying an adaptation miniplate across the fracture line as it exited the anterior surface of the maxilla. Screws were passed directly through the mucoperiosteum, to engage the palatal shelves and to lock the locking plate into position. Lacerations in the mucoperiosteum were neither used to aid fixation nor used as portals for dissection; incisions and mucoperiosteal flaps in the palatal vault were avoided. Adjuncts, such as intraoral splints, have not been used in cases to date, and early mobilization was allowed. Reconstitution of the craniomaxillofacial buttresses was added in patients with more extensive maxillary injury. The palatal appliance and screws remained rigidly in position in the roof of the mouth, much like an external fixator, until their removal 8 to 12 weeks after the repair. No patient suffered erosion of the mucoperiosteum or other major morbidity, other than a transient fistula of the soft palate. The palatoalveolar segments remained in proper realignment and inclination, and pretraumatic occlusal patterns and the width and depth of the lower face appear to have been restored with one exception. The latter suffered a subtle posterolateral open bite that was corrected orthodontically. Prealignment of fractured palatal shelves with one or more large ratchet clamps and two IMF posts provides several points of forced reduction of the palatal shelves, along the dental arch. In addition, stabilization with mini-locking plate(s) in the palatal vault and an <b>adaptation</b> <b>plate</b> across the fracture line, as it exits the maxilla, appear to have merit, based on this preliminary report (n[*]=[*] 8). Outcomes seen on computed tomography and clinical examination during this 3 -year experience have been favorable...|$|E

40|$|The Gauss-peak spectra (GPS) method {{represents}} individual pigment spectra as weighted sums of Gaussian functions, {{and uses}} these to model absorbance spectra of phytoplankton pigment mixtures. We here present several improvements {{for this type}} of methodology, including <b>adaptation</b> to <b>plate</b> reader technology and efficient model fitting by open source software. We use a one-step modeling of both pigment absorption and background attenua-tion with non-negative least squares, following a one-time instrument-specific calibration. The fitted background is shown to be higher than a solvent blank, with features reflecting contributions from both scatter and non-pigment absorption. We assessed pigment aliasing due to absorption spectra similarity by Monte Carlo simulation, and used this information to select a robust set of identifiable pigments that are also expected to be common in natural samples. To test the methodâ€™s performance, we analyzed absorbance spectra of pigment extracts from sediment cores, 75 natural lake samples, and four phytoplankton cultures, and compared the estimated pigment concentrations with concentrations obtained using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

40|$|Cytochrome P 450 {{activity}} in individual Chironomus riparius larvae {{was measured using}} a microtiter <b>plate</b> <b>adaptation</b> of the ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay. The sensitivity of this biomarker was tested by exposing larvae to phenobarbital (0. 5 and 1. 0 mM) and permethrin (1 and 10 mug/g). Both chemicals induced EROD {{activity in}} C. riparius larvae by up to 1. 58 -fold with PB and 2. 47 -fold with permethrin. EROD induction was more pronounced after 48 h. The initially high EROD activity in the controls suggested that P 450 s are induced by stress. Feeding levels prior to exposure also {{had a significant effect}} on EROD activity. EROD activity compared to the control was highest when larvae were fed double the normal ration. These results indicate that EROD activity in individual C. riparius may be a useful biomarker to add to a suite of biomarkers for the detection of freshwater pollution.

The chromogenic peptide substrate assay values for factor XII correlated well with those obtained in clotting (r= 0. 90; y= 15. 811 + 0. 8236 x) and immunochemical (r= 0. 88; y= 17. 90 + 0. 817 x) assays in the normal donor samples. Factor XII levels in the patients were significantly lower {{than those in the}} normal donors (83. 3 +/- 23. 2 % versus 103. 4 +/- 23. 1; p= 0. 004), and nine patients (12 %) had factor XII values below 50 % compared with only one of the normal donors (2. 5 %). Factor XII levels and kallikrein-like activities (a measure of contact system activation) were followed before, during, and one day after cardiopulmonary bypass in 20 patients. Factor XII levels were significantly reduced, and kallikrein-like activities significantly elevated after 5 and 30 minutes cardiopulmonary bypass. One day after monary bypass both factor XII levels and kallikrein-like activities were significantly lower than preoperation values. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Resection of the jaw is {{a primary}} option of {{treatment}} in mandibular ameloblastoma with bone damage. Mandibular resection will cause mandibular stability disturbance due toloss of {{some part of the}} bone. Instability of the mandible can cause aesthetic, physiological, and psychological malfunctioning. To restore its stability, installment of mandibular reconstruction plate on the remaining mandibular by using screws. However, it is not uncommon that plate exposure occurs following mandibular reconstruction, caused by inaccurate <b>adaptation</b> of the <b>plates</b> to the mandibular bone. A 3 D stereolithography modelcan help provide the best assesment on the bone defect, plan the making of the more easily pre-operative curved plates and provide more accurate faster surgery time. Objective: To evaluate plate exposure after mandibular resection with titanium reconstruction plates in Dr. SardjitoHospital. Case report: A case was reported on mandibular reconstruction after resection of ameloblastoma with titanium plate performed in Dr. Sardjito Hospital that experienced intra-oral plate exposure and oro-cutaneous fistula on the left mandible. The clinical evaluation showed the curved titanium plate did not adapt well with the remaining mandibular bone; therefore, the titanium plate was removed without replacing it with a new plate. Inappropriate adaptationof curved titanium plate {{is one of the main}} causes of plate exposure.

40|$|PURPOSE: Virtual {{planning}} and guided surgery {{with or without}} prebent or milled plates {{are becoming more and}} more common for mandibular reconstruction with fibular free flaps (FFFs). Although this excellent surgical option is being used more widely, the question of the additional cost of {{planning and}} cutting-guide production has to be discussed. In capped payment systems such additional costs have to be offset by other savings if there are no special provisions for extra funding. Our study was designed to determine whether using virtual planning and guided surgery resulted in time saved during surgery and whether this time gain resulted in self-funding of such planning through the time saved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All consecutive cases of FFF surgery were evaluated during a 2 -year period. Institutional data were used to determine the price of 1 minute of operative time. The time for fibula molding, <b>plate</b> <b>adaptation,</b> and insetting was recorded. RESULTS: During the defined period, we performed 20 mandibular reconstructions using FFFs, 9 with virtual planning and guided surgery and 11 freehand cases. One minute of operative time was calculated to cost US $ 47. 50. Multiplying this number by the time saved, we found that the additional cost of virtual planning was reduced from US $ 5, 098 to US $ 1, 231. 50 with a prebent plate and from US $ 6, 980 to US $ 3, 113. 50 for a milled plate.

40|$|Enterococcus spp. were {{collected}} from poultry production and processing environments across a region of the eastern seaboard of the United States. Using a microtiter <b>plate</b> <b>adaptation</b> of traditional biochemical assays, 532 isolates were identified to the species level. E. faecalis was observed to be the predominant species recovered (64 %), followed by E. faecium (24 %), E. hirae (6 %), E. gallinarum (5 %), and less than 1 % of E. avium, E. casseliflavus, E. durans, and indeterminate species. All isolates were tested for susceptibility to 28 antimicrobials using broth microdilution. Antimicrobial resistance was observed among the isolates with E. faecalis more resistant to lincosamide, macrolide, and tetracycline antimicrobials and E. faecium more resistant to fluoroquinolone and penicillin antimicrobials. Resistance to multiple antimicrobials was observed among all species, with a proportionately greater diversity of resistance phenotypes among isolates of E. faecium. The prevalence of resistance to an important antimicrobial used in human medicine, the streptogramin quinupristin-dalfopristin, was demonstrated among 63 % of E. faecium isolates. These observations led to {{the investigation of the}} molecular determinants among those isolates of E. faecium that contributed to resistance to the group of antibiotics known as the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) superfamily. Ribotype analysis demonstrated that four ribotypes constituted 65 % of the observed population, but displayed diverse antibiograms, suggestive of the acquisition of multiple resistance elements to other antimicrobials. This was consistent with the absence of geographic clustering of MLS phenotypes or ribotypes. Colony PCR screening for the streptogramin resistance determinants erm(A), erm(B), mef(A), lnu(B), msr(C), vgb(A), vat(D), and vat(E) was performed. Resistance to streptogramin antimicrobials was largely unaccounted for by PCR screening for specific resistance determinants. Erythromycin methyltransferase determinants erm(A) and erm(B) were observed among 7. 5 % and 5 % of resistant isolates whereas the efflux gene msr(C), the streptogramin B hydrolase vgb(A), or the streptogramin A acetyltransferase genes vat(D) and vat(E) were not detected among resistant E. faecium. Mef(A) was detected in only 4 % of macrolide-resistant isolates whereas the screening for lnu(B) was not successful. These results indicate that streptogramin resistance is widespread among E. faecium from the poultry production environment but the mechanisms of resistance within this population remain largely uncharacterized...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{introduction}} in 1937, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) {{has become the}} most commonly used material for denture bases. This is largely due to its favourable although not ideal characteristics. One of the main problems associated with PMMA is the polymerisation shrinkage exhibited by the material. Injection moulding systems have been developed to compensate for this by continuously injecting PMMA resin at pressure throughout a carefully controlled polymerisation procedure. This study aimed to compare acrylic specimens processed by injection moulding and conventional pressure packing in relation to dimensional accuracy. Subsequent experiments evaluated adherence of Candida albicans to denture base materials. A cobalt chrome control denture base was used to fabricate stone moulds in which 20 injection moulded and 20 conventional pressure packed PMMA resin denture bases were produced. These denture bases incorporated 6 reference points between which sequential measurements were taken using digital callipers. Base <b>plate</b> <b>adaptation</b> was additionally measured by weighing a vinyl polysiloxane film to reproduce any discrepancy between the denture base and master model. Linear dimensional measurements revealed that changes in dimension did not occur evenly over the entire denture base for either sample group. Injection moulded samples exhibited statistically significant differences when compared to control in two of the six measured linear dimensions. Conventional pressure packed materials exhibited a statistically significant difference in one of the measured linear dimensions compared to control. Statistically significant linear dimensional differences were determined between injection moulded and conventional pressure packed materials in three measured dimensions. For injection moulded materials, the location of the injection moulding inlet may have influenced the dimensional accuracy For the weighed vinyl polysiloxane data, a greater weight of material was recovered from conventional pressure packed material samples than injection moulded samples. These data demonstrate that injection moulded denture bases have superior internal surface adaptation compared to conventional pressure packed acrylic resin. Squares of denture base material were produced by injection moulding and conventional pressure packing techniques. Self cured PMMA resin was additionally included in candidal adherence and surface morphology analysis. Profilometer testing determined self-cure resin surfaces had more irregular surface characteristics than surfaces of conventional or injection moulded samples. Conventionally processed samples exhibited the smoothest material surface. However, conventional and injection moulded sample groups were similar. Scanning electron microscopy of the three material sample groups was performed to determine surface morphology and patterns of candidal adherence and subsequent biofilm formation. SEM examination revealed variations in surface morphology and following 1 hour, Candida albicans cells were observed to adhere and aggregate within the various surface irregularities of all three materials. Examination after 24 hours demonstrated the complex intertwining hyphae evident on all the material samples, irrespective of initial candidal adherence patterns. No significant differences were observed between attachment of the 9 C. albicans clinical strains when tested independently against each sample group. However, comparison of the mean attachment of all strains to the 3 sample groups revealed a statistically significant difference in attachment capacity between conventional and self cured sample groups. Self cured PMMA resin samples exhibited significantly less candidal attachment than conventionally processed samples, indicating that material surface factors may play a greater role in promoting or preventing candidal adhesion that the organism per se. As the denture bearing mucosa is compressible and the achieved palatal seal largely dependent on the prepared post dam, small dimensional changes demonstrated in this study may be of limited clinical relevance to {{the success or failure of}} the material as a denture base. C. albicans were found to adhere to all three types of PMMA resin and if left undisturbed, Candida cells proliferated to form a biofilm upon all resin materials. Therefore, the observed differences in attachment are likely to be of limited clinical importance in the prevention of candidal infection without consideration to denture and oral hygiene...|$|R
40|$|Este estudo avaliou as alteraÃ§Ãµes produzidas nos arcos dentais superiores de pacientes submetidos Ã  ExpansÃ£o RÃ¡pida da Maxila Assistida Cirurgicamente (ERMAC).

Para cada paciente foram preparados trÃªs modelos de gesso obtidos em diferentes fases: Inicial, antes do procedimento operatÃ³rio (T 1); trÃªs meses pÃ³s-expansÃ£o (travamento do expansor) e momento da remoÃ§Ã£o do aparelho expansor tipo Hyrax e colocaÃ§Ã£o da placa removÃ­vel de acrÃ­lico para contenÃ§Ã£o (T 2); seis meses pÃ³s-expansÃ£o e momento de remoÃ§Ã£o da placa de acrÃ­lico (T 3). O dispositivo expansor utilizado foi o disjuntor tipo Hyrax. O procedimento cirÃºrgico adotado foi a osteotomia lateral da maxila sem o envolvimento da lÃ¢mina pterigÃ³ide, osteotomia da espinha nasal Ã  linha mÃ©dia dental (incisivos centrais superiores), separaÃ§Ã£o da sutura palatina mediana por meio de cinzel e separaÃ§Ã£o do septo nasal.

The sample was composed of 50 orthodontic superior models of 18 patients (six males and 12 females. The average age was 23, 3 years. For each patient three orthodontic models had been prepared in different phases: initial, pre-operative stage (T 1), three months after expansion (expander locking) and removal of Hyrax expander appliance, and <b>adaptation</b> of acrylic <b>plate</b> for contention (T 2), six months of postexpansion and acrylic plate removal period (T 3). The appliance {{used in this study}} was the Hyrax type. The adopted surgical procedure was the lateral osteotomy of the maxilla, without involving the pterygoid plate, osteotomy from the nasal spine to the maxillary dental midline (superior central incisor), the midpalatal suture separation with a chisel and the separation of nasal septum also. The activation initiated on the third day postoperative, being one-quarter turn in the morning and one-quarter turn in the night. The activations had followed clinical criteria for the control of the expansion. The measures had been carried out through the machine of threedimensional measurement (SAC), based on the alterations in the three plans (vertical, sagittal and transversal) occurred in the orthodontic models. Conclusions: 1) There were statistically significant increase in the transversal distances in all the teeth groups (from central incisors to second molars) of T 1 for T 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of the treatment. The variables did not show statistically significant difference of T 2 for T 3, indicating stability after six months following the SARME; 2) There were a statistically significant increase in the inclinations of the first and the second molar of right and left sides, and the second premolar of the left side only, suggesting a anti-symmetrical behavior of evaluated teeth; 3) There were an increase in the palatine width in the analyzed intervals, with statistically significant differences between T 1 x T 2 and T 1 x T 3; 4) Statistically significant differences were not observed in the pala tine depth in the analyzed intervals.
