Based on Standard of National Industry, populer as SNI, number 01 - 3920 - 1995, the corn was well stored at moisture content 14 % or below (wet basis). However, conventional corn drying dealed with in-efficient energy process and corn quality degradation. This research evaluated the performance of corn drying assisted by zeolite as moisture adsorbent. In this process, the zeolite and corn were placed in the dryer fluidized by warm air as drying medium under 40 - 50 oC. The air evaporated water product from corn, and at same time the zeolite adsorbed moisture in air. So, the relative humidity of air in dryer can be kept low in which enhanced the driving force for drying. Beside that, the moisture <b>adsoprtion</b> by zeolite was exothermic process that can supply the energy for drying or keep the dryer temperature. Thus, the drying rate can be faster. This work foccussed to observe the effect of drying temperature, air velocity, and corn to zeolite ratio on drying time as well as corn quality. As indicators, the drying rate was estimated and the proxymates content such as protein, fat, and carbohydrate content were analyzed. The results showed that compared with conventional fluidised bed dryer, corn drying with zeolite, can speed up drying time as well as improving the constant of drying rate. In addition, the corn proximate nutrition content can be well retained.

40|$|The {{thermodynamics}} and kinetics {{of protein}} adsorption on bare surfaces {{as well as}} on surfaces with grafted polymers are studied using a molecular theoretical approach. The cases studied include adsorption of globular proteins, competitive adsorption from protein mixtures, adsorption with conformational change and surface-induced phase separation of proteins. For the case of competitive adsorption from a solution containing a mixture of large and small proteins, a variety of different <b>adsoprtion</b> patterns are observed depending upon the bulk composition, the protein-surface interaction and the size of proteins. It is found that the experimentally observed Vroman sequence is predicted in the case that the bulk solution is at a composition with an excess of the small protein, and that the interaction between the large protein and the surface is much larger than that of the small protein. For adsorption on surfaces with grafted polymers, the effects of changing polymer-surface interactions, polymer chain length, polymer segment volume and surface coverage of grafted polymers on controlling protein adsorption are studied. Our results show that the ability of the polymer layer to prevent protein adsorption at equilibrium is different from that during kinetics. Thermodynamically, increasing polymer-surface attraction, increasing surface coverage and using polymers with larger segments help to better reduce protein adsorption. Whereas changing polymer chain length has little effect on preventing protein adsorption when polymers are long enough. However, longer polymer chains, weaker polymer-surface interactions, higher surface coverage and larger segments are better at kinetically retarding protein adsorption. When studying phase separation of proteins, we found both the bulk concentration and the protein-surface interaction affect the coexistence of proteins with different densities on the surface. ...|$|E
40|$|Novel spherical {{nano-scaled}} cellulose particles {{have been}} prepared by high-pressure homogenizing of four different types of pre-treated cellulose samples with MICROFLUIDIZER™ processor (MF) in aqueous media. One possibility of pre-treatment is a decrystallization step realized by dissolving and regenerating cellulose from a melt NMMNO*H 2 O solvent system. Nanocellulose was obtained by a subsequent high-pressure mechanical treatment of the precipitate in aqueous dispersion. Decrystallization was also realized by grinding cellulose in a planetary mill. Ground cellulose was subsequently dispersed with high-speed stirrer Ultra-Turrax™ (UT) and high-pressure homogenizer. The amorphous intermediates were characterized by means of WAXS, Raman spectroscopy and DP determination. By another way the preparation of nano-scaled cellulose was conducted by hydrolysis and following mechanical treatment of hydrolyzed cellulose with Ultra-Turrax™ and MICROFLUIDIZER™. A further alternative was given by the mechanical treatment of aqueous dispersions of low substituted cellulose derivatives. For example methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose and oxidized cellulose gave nano-scaled materials with interesting properties. In order to obtain information about cellulose particle sizes, UT and MF treated dispersions were characterized by means of static and dynamic light scattering (DLS), ultra-centrifugation and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Rheomechanical measurements revealed the viscoelastic properties and gel-like structure of the materials as well as time- and shear-dependent effects like thixotropy and pseudoplasticity (structural viscosity). In conjunction with potential applications film forming properties and temperature dependent behaviour (e. g. viscosity) of the materials were investigated. Additionally, the barrier properties against oxygen and moisture of nanocellulose coated polyester foils were examined.

40|$|Adsorption onto silica-based high {{surface area}} {{carriers}} {{is a long}} known methodof improvement drug dissolution rate, which has been described in early 1970 s [1]. Porous silica has many silanol groups on its surface {{and can be used}} as pharmaceutical excipient, since it is regarded nontoxic after oral application. Due to its porous structure and large specific surface area, porous silica has a great capacity to adsorb organic compounds into its nano-sized pores and can improve physical stability of amorphous drug [2]. Solid dispersions of carvedilol in porous silica (Sylysia 350) were prepared by solvent evaporation in a vacuum evaporator which ensures efficient pore filling procedure [3]. Two sets with different concentrations of carvedilol insolid dispersions were prepared, which differ in pore filling process. Set a) was prepared by one-step filling and set b) by multiple filling of smaller portions of dissolved carvedilol into porous silica. Solid dispersions were characterized by thermal analysis (DSC), X-ray diffraction and nitrogen <b>adsoprtion</b> experiments. Specific surface area and porosity parameters of soliddispersion samples confirm different mechanism of drug loading within silica pores in each experimental set. Results showed that carvedilol is more efficiently ĆpackedĆ inside porous matrix when multiple drug filling procedureof smaller amounts is used as suggested by absence of crystalline state of a drug and greatly reduced porosity, {{while at the same time}} physical stability of amorphous carvedilol was most improved.

Recombination frequencies for a group of selected markers in PM 5006 (D) x P 29 matings varied between 3 x (trp+) and 1. 2 x lo- ' (lys+) per donor. In the reverse cross, plasmid D mobilized markers on the P 29 chromosome randomly with a recombination frequency of about 1. 7 x per donor for all selected P 29 markers. R 772 produced random mobiliz-ation of markers on both chromosomes yielding recombinants at a frequency of about 1. 8 x per donor. Unselected markers separated by no more than about 10 min from selected markers on the PM 5006 chromosome were cotransferred from P 29 by both plasmids. Despite the low degree of DNA homology existing between the two species, all hybrids behaved as stable haploids. Progeny from P 29 (D or R 772) x PM 5006 auxotroph matings displayed similar sets of naturally occurring P 29 unselected markers irrespective of the selected prototroph allele.

40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is {{considered}} to be a major factor in the greenhouse effect and its concentration in the atmosphere is increasing. Thus, decrease of CO 2 in the atmosphere is very important. Many techniques for CO 2 reduction and fixation have been developed and studied over the last decade. In these techniques, the process of CO 2 methanation is a practical approach to effectively decrease CO 2, because CO 2 is converted into reusable chemicals and an appropriate catalyst can promote the reaction under relatively moderate conditions at ambient pressure. Extensive studies have been carried out on the methanation reaction under various catalytic systems 1 - 3. In this study, the catalysts containing 0. 5 wt% Ni supported on Mesostructured silica nanoparticles (MSN), Silica, MCM- 41 (Mobile Crystalline Material), HY (protonated Y zeolite) and ?-Al 2 O 3 were prepared by impregnation method for the methanation of CO 2. Catalytic testing was conducted in the temperature range of 423 - 723 K under atmospheric pressure in the presence of H 2. The activity of CO 2 methanation followed the order: Ni/MSN > Ni/MCM- 41 > Ni/HY > Ni/SiO 2 > Ni/?-Al 2 O 3. The high activity of Ni/MSN is due to the presence of both intra- and interparticle porosity which led to the high concentration of basic sites evidenced by N 2 isotherm and pyrrole adsorbed IR spectroscopy results. The methanation activities were found to be correlated to the concentration of basic sites as the basic sites were determined from the IR peak intensity of FTIR pyrrole <b>adsoprtion</b> (Figure 1). Therefore, high basic sites is essential for high carbon dioxide adsorption on the catalyst to form carbon species, while Ni sites dissociated hydrogen to form atomic hydrogen.

40|$|Cement {{treatment}} for pavement basecourse materials {{results in the}} creation of cement treated basecourse which is either classified as "modified" or "stabilised". The two classifications perform differently in service, with susceptibility to fatigue being the most obvious characteristic delineating the two. This classification methodology is currently quantified based on Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) ranges. Throughout the 1990 s to the early 2000 s, Main Roads Western Australia (MRWA) has investigated various basecourse products created by adding cement. However, due to unexpected behaviour when applying the cement treated basecourse materials, MRWA sanctioned restrictions of its use in Western Australia. "Stabilised" basecourse were not to be used on roads and strength gained from "modified" basecourse is to be ignored. This is quantified by measuring the UCS gained from the cement treatment. Nevertheless, using UCS to classify cement treated crushed rock is injudicious and does not portray the insitu behaviour and characteristics of cement treated crushed rock basecourse. This dissertation therefore investigates the characteristics of cement treated crushed rock basecourse for Western Australian roads. This is to determine a better method to quantify the various classification of cement treated basecourse and understand its insitu behaviour. Subsequently, the result provides encouragement to reintroduce the use of cement treated crushed rocks in Western Australia. Amongst the characteristics investigated are strength, fatigue, shrinkage, durability and erodibility. These characteristics are assessed against varying cement content. The dissertation combines known standard testing methods along with uniquely developed testing methods to establish numerical models for characterising the materials. This includes the application of the Four Point Bending Test for fatigue, Tube Suction Test for durability, Nitrogen <b>Adsoprtion</b> for shrinkage, and Wheel Tracking Test for erodibility. A finite element model is also created to validate the results for fatigue. This dissertation has improved the understanding of the cement treated crushedrock materials.

40|$|During storm events, {{the flow}} in a {{combined}} sewer system can exceed the capacity and, as a result, a combined sewer overflow (CSO) will occur. During a CSO raw wastewater is discharged to surface water. This wastewater {{is a mixture of}} raw sanitary wastewater, raw industrial wastewater and rainwater. The receiving water will get polluted by dissolved as well as undissolved pollutants. Therefore a CSO can cause damage to the ecological and biological state of the receiving water and besides it can cause public health risks. Until now the problem, with respect to CSOs in the Netherlands, is dominated by a quantitative approach. CSO flow rates and frequencies were in the past decades the main subject of research. These frequencies were translated into the Wet Verontreiniging Oppervlaktewater (1970). In the year 1998 the Ministry of Transport and Water Management came with a renewed policy, the fourth Memorandum on Water Management, dealing with groundwater, dehydration and water quality, for the protection and the recovery of nature. At the end of 2000 the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) came into force, which charges the European members of the EU to report obligatory. The aim of the WFD is to have an ecological and biological balance for all surface waters and groundwater in Europe effectively working in 2015. Measures are required to push back the pollution by defined dangerous substances. Measures with regard to the reduction of CSO frequencies alone is not enough to fulfil the legislation. When a CSO occurs an amount of pollutants will enter the surface water. CSO water needs to be treated to prevent pollution and odour annoyances to the surroundings. The goal of this research is to find a suitable treatment technique or a combination of treatment techniques. Primary and secondary techniques, adsorption and disinfection techniques are described. Primary techniques remove suspended solids and a fraction of the organic material, secondary techniques remove suspended solids and biological degradable material. Adsorption techniques are used to remove for example endocrine disrupting substances and disinfection techniques are used to minimize health risks for the population. In the Netherlands CSOs occur five to ten times a year per location. Therefore a treatment technique {{needs to be able to}} start up in a few minutes even after a long period without feedwater and should be able to handle wide and quick variations in flow without causing any inconveniences to the surroundings.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{dynamics}} of zeolites and zeolite-guest systems under thermal equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. The work was developed in four stages. First, we applied electronic structure methods to calculate transition state parameters for the O(1) → O(4) proton transfer in H-Y zeolite. We found an O(1) → O(4) barrier height of 86. 1 kJ mol− 1, and a barrier curvature at the transition state of 1570 cm − 1. Including long range effects {{from the work of}} Sauer et al. [ACS Symp. Ser. 721, 358 (1999) ] results in a higher barrier, which we estimate to be 97. 1 kJ mol− 1. We consider that our barriers are notably larger than those reported in experimental literature as a result of neglecting tunneling in their interpretation of experimental data. ^ Next, we modeled benzene 2 ̆ 7 s orientational dynamics in Na-Y zeolite, using kinetic Monte Carlo and mean field master equation, motivated by the NMR study of Isfort et al. [Chem. Phys. Lett. 288, 71 (1998) ]. We consider guest-guest interactions including only site blocking and both site blocking and nearest-neighbor attractions. We found an apparent activation energy greater than the fundamental cage-to-cage barrier when considering only site blocking, and smaller when also including guest-guest attractions. This suggests that the actual cage-to-cage barrier is greater than 40 kJ mol− 1 reported by Isfort et al., which lends credence to previous simulations of benzene in Na-Y. ^ We also performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of zeolite-guest systems driven by microwaves (MW), motivated by the MW-driven sorption study of Turner et al. [AIChE J. 46, 758 (2000) ]. Zeolite-benzene systems show minimal MW heating, while zeolite-methanol systems exhibit significant MW heating with steady-state temperatures increasing linearly with methanol loading. MW-driven equimolar mixtures of benzene and methanol at low to medium loadings in zeolites obey Tmethanol 2 ̆ 6 Gt; Tbenzene 3 ̆e Tzeolite, suggesting that MW heating of binary mixtures in zeolites can produce novel effects. However, MW-driven MD at higher loadings shows that Tmethanol ∼ Tbenzene 3 ̆e Tzeolite, suggesting that closely related MW sorption studies can produce markedly different results viz. athermal effects. ^ Finally, we performed grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMG) sorption simulations of single component and binary mixtures of methanol/benzene in silicalite at equilibrium conditions. We found that single component <b>adsoprtion</b> isotherms are in qualitative agreement with both experimental and ideal isotherms, the latter calculated assuming Langmuir adsorption. Saturation loading of benzene and methanol were 5. 8 ± 0. 5 and 17. 5 ± 1 molecules per unit cell at 300 K. Results at 350 K show that saturation loadings decreased to 4. 6 ± 0. 5 and 10. 8 ± 1 molecules per unit cell, for benzene and methanol, respectively. Adsorption isotherms of binary mixtures shows a marked change in silicalite 2 ̆ 7 s selectivity for benzene as a function of loading. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} integration of enzymes and redox mediators capable of transferring electrons between enzymes and electrodes. This was done with a view to developing a semi- or fully implantable, miniature, membrane-less enzymatic fuel cell (EFC) exploiting enzymatic oxidation of glucose coupled to the enzymatic reduction of dissolved dioxygen. Miniaturisation is possible if appropriate enzymes are selected as catalysts, instead of non-selective precious metal catalysts, by removal of ion-exchange membrane from assembled fuel cells. Chapter two reports a novel method for the preparation of mediated biocatalytic enzyme electrodes for glucose oxidation, by cross-linking films of glucose oxidase, polymer supports, and a range of osmium complexes bearing functional groups on graphite electrodes. The redox potentials of the osmium complexes are manipulated by preparation of complexes using either 2, 22 ̆ 7 -bipyridine, or 2, 22 ̆ 7 -bipyridine with substitution of electron withdrawing or electron donating groups in the 4 and 42 ̆ 7 positions, as ligands. Complexes with lower redox potential, desired for mediation of enzymatic glucose oxidation in fuel cell anodes, are based on use of 4, 42 ̆ 7 -dimethyl- 2, 22 ̆ 7 -bipyridine or 4, 42 ̆ 7 -dimethoxy- 2, 22 ̆ 7 -bipyridine as a ligand instead of 2, 22 ̆ 7 -bipyridine. Glucose oxidation current densities of 30 and 70 [mu]A cm(- 2) at 0. 2 and 0. 35 V vs. Ag/AgCl applied potential were obtained for enzyme electrodes prepared using [osmium(4, 42 ̆ 7 -dimethoxy- 2, 22 ̆ 7 -bipyridine) 2 (4 -aminomethylpyridine) Cl]+ complexes and [osmium(4, 42 ̆ 7 -dimethyl- 2, 22 ̆ 7 -bipyridine) 2 (4 -aminomethylpyridine) Cl]+ compared to 120 [mu]A cm(- 2) at 0. 45 V vs. Ag/AgCl for the enzyme electrode using [osmium(2, 22 ̆ 7 -bipyridine) 2 (4 -aminomethylpyridine) Cl]+, under pseudo-physiological conditions in 5 mM glucose, however stability of signals proved insufficient for long-term operation. The availability of redox mediators, polymer supports and cross-linkers offers wide scope for investigation of anchoring and cross-linking methodology that may improve current generation and stability to provide enzyme electrodes capable for application to longer-term glucose biosensors and anodes in enzymatic fuel cells. Chapter three focuses on an investigation of enzyme electrodes for oxygen reduction at high potentials, for application to EFC cathodes, based on co-immobilisation of multi-copper oxidases, such as bilirubin oxidase or a Streptomyces coelicolor laccase (SLac), with osmium redox complexes possessing an amine-functional group, in the presence of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) at graphite electrodes. Oxygen reduction current densities of 0. 8 mA cm(- 2) under pseudo-physiological conditions at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl are obtained by co-immobilisation of SLac, polyallylamine, MWCNTs and an [osmium(2, 22 ̆ 7 -bipyridine) 2 (4 -aminomethylpyridine) Cl]+ complex. Enzyme electrodes prepared by incorporation of added MWCNT as a support in oxygen saturated, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM phosphate buffer solution at 37 Â°C, demonstrate a 3 -fold increase in oxygen reduction current densities over those prepared without MWCNT. EFCs were assembled by combining the SLac-based enzyme electrode as a cathode, with glucose-oxidising anodes, based on either a pyrroloquinoline quinone or FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenases and selected osmium redox complexes. The EFC assembled based on the PQQ-dependent glucose dehydrogenase enzyme electrode as the anode provides a maximum power density of 66 [mu]W cm(- 2) in 5 mM glucose, 150 mM NaCl, phosphate buffer solution at 37 Â°C. On operation in human serum, although the EFC power dropped to 37 [mu]W cm(- 2), it still represents the highest reported power density to date for an enzymatic fuel cell operating in serum. Chapter four reports studies on enzyme electrodes for glucose oxidation prepared using films of novel osmium complex-modified redox polymers as mediators for application to biosensors or biofuel cells. These novel redox polymers were developed by coupling osmium complexes containing amine functional groups to synthetic epoxy-functionalised polymers, providing the possibility of tuning both redox polymer potential, by variation in Os complex ligand, and redox polymer physicochemical properties, by variation in monomer selection and ratio. The capability of the redox polymers to function as mediators for glucose oxidation was tested by co-immobilisation onto graphite with glucose oxidase or an FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase using a range of crosslinkers and in the presence and absence of MWCNT. Glucose oxidation current densities as high as 560 [mu]A cm(- 2) were obtained in 100 mM glucose, 150 mM NaCl, phosphate buffer solution at 0. 45 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Films prepared by crosslinking polymer bound-[Os(4, 42 ̆ 7 -dimethoxy- 2, 22 ̆ 7 -bipyridine) 2 (4 -aminomethylpyridine) Cl]+, an FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase, and carbon nanotubes provided current densities of 215 [mu]A cm(- 2) in 5 mM glucose at the lower potential of 0. 2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, showing some promise for application to glucose oxidising EFCs. Chapter five reports on use of a fragmented form of a deglycosylated pyranose dehydrogenase (fdgPDH), produced when the deglycosylated enzyme (dgPDH) loses a C-terminal fragment when stored in buffer solution at 4 Â°C, as a glucose-oxidising catalyst for EFC anodes. A comparison of the capability of three forms of PDH, the native glycosylated enzyme (gPDH), the dgPDH and the fdgPDH, to function as catalysts for glucose oxidation when co-immobilised with osmium redox polymers on graphite electrodes, using flow injection amperometry and cyclic voltammetry, is reported. Higher glucose oxidation current densities are observed for using the fdgPDH when osmium redox polymers with low redox potentials, [Os(4, 42 ̆ 7 -dimethoxy- 2, 22 ̆ 7 -bipyridine) 2 (poly-vinylimidazole) 10 Cl]+ and [Os(4, 42 ̆ 7 -dimethyl- 2, 22 ̆ 7 -bipyridine) 2 (poly-vinylimidazole) 10 Cl]+, are selected for the comparison. Under pseudo-physiological conditions, glucose oxidation current densities of 0. 3 mA cm(- 2) are obtained from films containing [Os(4, 42 ̆ 7 -dimethyl- 2, 22 ̆ 7 -bipyridine) 2 (poly-vinylimidazole) 10 Cl]+ and fdgPDH at 0 V vs Ag/AgCl in 5 mM glucose, 150 mM NaCl, phosphate buffer solution. Improved access of the substrate to the active site and improved communication between enzyme and mediator within the film, possibly due to higher local concentration of redox complex, are suggested as two main reasons for the improved current generation of enzyme electrodes prepared using the fdgPDH when compared with thos prepared using the gPDH and dgPDH. Operation of an assembled, membrane-less EFC in physiological solutions, human saliva and blood is demonstrated to provide power to an electronic device to enable wireless transmission of sensing data. The EFC is prepared using the fdgPDH co-immobilised on graphite with [Os(4, 42 ̆ 7 -dimethyl- 2, 22 ̆ 7 -bipyridine) 2 (poly-vinylimidazole) 10 Cl]+ and MWCNT as anode, coupled to an oxygen-reducing cathode based on <b>adsoprtion</b> of a bilirubin oxidase on gold nanoparticles. Maximum power densities of up to 325 [mu]W cm(- 2) were obtained in 5 mM glucose, 150 mM NaCl, phosphate buffer solution. When tested in whole human blood a power density of 80 [mu]W cm(- 2) was achieved, the highest power density reported to date for EFCs operating in human blood. Finally, chapter 6 summarises my research attempts to address some the problems associated with the integration of biocatalysts and mediators, and looking at a range of techniques to improve the current output and stability of these modified enzyme-based electrodes through the incorporation of nanoparticles and/or different immobilising techniques. Chapter 6 also provides some opinion on the direction such research may take in the future. My PhD also included the synthesis of a range of redox polymers, which were also distributed to a range of collaborating partners resulting in a number of publications which continues to grow. Although these results are not discussed in this thesis, an appendix is included providing a list of my co-authored publications along with oral and poster presentations and research visits made over the course of my PhD studies...|$|E
