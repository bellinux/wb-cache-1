For Mars, they knew, for example, that the planet made 37 synodic periods, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. The Babylonians invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets. This technique was primarily derived from timing measurements—such as when Mars rose above the horizon, rather than from the less accurately known position of the planet on the celestial sphere.|$|E

Hill also raised money for Haitian refugees, supported clean water well-building projects in Kenya and Uganda, and staged a rap concert in Harlem to promote voter registration. A 1997 benefit event for the Refugee Project introduced a Board of Trustees for the organization that included Sean Combs, Mariah Carey, Busta Rhymes, Spike Lee, and others as members.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to dogs, cats have not undergone major changes during the domestication process, as the form <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> the domestic cat is not {{radically different from}} those of wildcats and domestic cats are perfectly capable of surviving in the wild. Fully domesticated house cats often interbreed with feral F. catus populations, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat. This limited evolution during domestication means that hybridisation can occur with many other felids, notably the Asian leopard cat. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have predisposed them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play and relatively high intelligence. Several small felid species may have an inborn tendency towards tameness.|$|E

5|$|Silent Hill: Shattered Memories divides its {{gameplay}} {{between two}} different settings. The first section {{is set in}} a psychotherapist's office and the second in a town called Silent Hill. In the first section, the player interacts with Dr. Michael Kaufmann, a therapist who is a non-player character, from a first-person perspective. The player responds to Kaufmann's questions and completes a psychological test, fills in a questionnaire or colors pictures. The player's responses to these tests alters aspects of gameplay in the second setting, including the available areas, the physical appearance <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> characters encountered, and the physical appearance of the monsters. Shattered Memories returns to Kaufmann's office periodically throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development <b>and</b> <b>behavior.</b> <b>Of</b> special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known {{to work their way}} through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and imidacloprid in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} biology traces {{the study of}} the living world from ancient to modern times. Although the concept of biology as a single {{coherent}} field arose in the 19th century, the biological sciences emerged from traditions of medicine and natural history reaching back to ayurveda, ancient Egyptian medicine and the works of Aristotle and Galen in the ancient Greco-Roman world. This ancient work was further developed in the Middle Ages by Muslim physicians and scholars such as Avicenna. During the European Renaissance and early modern period, biological thought was revolutionized in Europe by a renewed interest in empiricism and the discovery of many novel organisms. Prominent in this movement were Vesalius and Harvey, who used experimentation and careful observation in physiology, and naturalists such as Linnaeus and Buffon who began to classify the diversity of life and the fossil record, as well as the development <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> organisms. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek revealed by means of microscopy the previously unknown world of microorganisms, laying the groundwork for cell theory. The growing importance of natural theology, partly a response to the rise of mechanical philosophy, encouraged the growth of natural history (although it entrenched the argument from design).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if environmental education causes a change in the environmental attitudes <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> hotel housekeepers. Hotels are attempting to act socially and financially responsible by adopting environmentally conscious policies including recycling programs. Hotel employees, particularly housekeepers, are the recycling stewards and their environmental attitudes influence recycling behaviors. The 10 item, 5 -point Likert style New Ecological Paradigm Scale for Children was used to assess the environmental attitudes <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> hotel housekeepers in the areas of rights of nature, eco-crisis, and human exemptionalism. The experimental design involved a pretest for all participants in the experimental and control groups. The experimental group then received environmental training; while the control group did not receive any training or information. After 60 days, the hotel housekeepers at both the control and experimental hotels answered the identical questions a second time. The pretest and posttest data was analyzed using a mixed method design. Findings, as reflected in the overall score, rights of nature, eco-crisis, and human exemptionalism, indicated that no significant change occurred in the attitudes <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> the experimental group. These findings indicate that upper management support, training selected and the sample surveyed influenced the results of this study. Further research addressing these limitations is required to determine if environmental education can cause a change in environmental attitudes <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> hotel housekeepers...|$|R
50|$|Self-categorization theory {{provides}} {{an account of}} social influence. This account is {{sometimes referred to as}} the theory of referent informational influence. According to self-categorization theory, as social identities become salient, and depersonalization and self-stereotyping occurs, people adopt the norms, beliefs, <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> fellow ingroup members. They also distance themselves from the norms, beliefs, <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> comparison outgroup members. When someone observes a difference between themselves and a fellow ingroup member that person will experience subjective uncertainty. That uncertainty can be resolved by either a) recategorizing people or the situation to reflect those perceived differences, or b) engaging in a social influence process whereby one person makes changes to become more similar to the other. Which person adopts the views or <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> the other (i.e. who influences who) is predicted to be that person who is most prototypical of the ingroup. In other words, the person who exemplifies the norms, values, <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> the ingroup the most. The self-categorization theory account of social influence has received a large amount of empirical support.|$|R

In addition, phase transitions in colloidal suspensions can be studied in real time using optical techniques, and are analogous to phase transitions in liquids. In many interesting cases optical fluidity is used to control colloid suspensions.|$|E
