5|$|During the engagement, 12 militiamen {{were killed}} by Band warriors while making <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> a small hill. The {{remainder}} of the militia fled back to Dixon's Ferry. Citizens erected a monument in 1901 in Stillman Valley, Illinois commemorating the battle. A 2006 article corroborates that militia volunteer Abraham Lincoln {{was present at the}} battleground's burials; sources agree about little else. Investigation continues in the early 21st century about facts of the skirmish.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{skipped the}} opening {{ceremony}} of the 2008 Summer Olympics, on 8 August 2008 in Beijing. He attended the closing ceremony instead, on 24 August 2008. Brown had been under intense pressure from human rights campaigners {{to send a message}} to China, concerning the 2008 Tibetan unrest. His decision not to attend {{the opening ceremony}} was not an act of protest, but rather was made several weeks in advance and not intended as <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> principle.|$|E
5|$|The arena has <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> each of {{the floor}} area's four sides. The {{northern}} part of the arena has two tiers for seating, while the south stand has only one tier for seating; the upper tier is reserved for executive suites and restaurant space. The southern stand also has 53 disabled places, with the same number of spaces for their companions. There are 36 entrances to the inner part of the arena. In the {{northern part of the}} arena, there are facilities for ice hockey practice.|$|E

5|$|The club {{were granted}} a licence to build <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> the Railway Terrace {{at a cost}} of £25,000. Vale {{struggled}} in the league in early 1954, losing 2–1 to Hartlepools United in a fierce wind at Victoria Park. Cheadle was again absent through injury, as two goals from Tommy McGuigan ended Vale's record run of 21 games unbeaten. Title rivals Gateshead then left Vale Park with a point after a goalless draw, ending the club's record run of 12 consecutive home victories.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhibition}} {{opened on}} July 9, 1962, with Warhol absent. The thirty-two single soup can canvases {{were placed in}} a single line, much like products on shelves, each displayed on narrow individual ledges. The contemporary impact was uneventful, but the historical impact is considered today {{to have been a}} watershed. The gallery audience was unsure what to make of the exhibit. A John Coplans Artforum article, which was in part spurred on by the responding display of dozens of soup cans by a nearby gallery with a display advertising them at three for 60 cents, encouraged people to take <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> Warhol. Few actually saw the paintings at the Los Angeles exhibit or at Warhol's studio, but word spread in the form of controversy and scandal due to the work's seeming attempt to replicate the appearance of manufactured objects. Extended debate on the merits and ethics of focusing one's efforts on such a mundane commercial inanimate model kept Warhol's work in art world conversations. The pundits could not believe an artist would reduce the art form to the equivalent of a trip to the local grocery store. Talk did not translate into monetary success for Warhol. Dennis Hopper was the first of only a half dozen to pay $100 for a canvas. Blum decided to try to keep the thirty-two canvases as an intact set and bought back the few sales. This pleased Warhol who had conceived of them as a set, and he agreed to sell the set for ten monthly $100 installments to Blum. Warhol had passed the milestone of his first serious art show. While this exhibition was on view in Los Angeles, Martha Jackson canceled another planned December 1962 New York exhibition.|$|E

25|$|To enable {{censorship}} of undesirable sites, all Internet traffic {{into and out}} of Singapore was required to be routed through local proxy servers. As a token of this restriction, to placate social conservatives, prominent porn websites such as Playboy and Penthouse were blocked. The official explanation was that the Government wanted to signal <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> undesirable sites without unduly hindering the development of the Internet. However, websites of local origin were monitored more closely than those from overseas.|$|E

His activism against gambling, prostitution, and government corruption while at the Troy Tribune influenced the newly elected Governor, Adlai Stevenson, to take <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> these issues, creating national exposure for Simon that later resulted in his testifying before the Kefauver Commission.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1961, those {{fighting}} to save the dunes began to see greater possibilities for hope. Then President John F.

President Kennedy also took <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> the National Lakeshore, outlining a program to link the nation's economic vitality to a movement for conservation of the natural environment.

25|$|Thomas Arkell of Arkell's Brewery donated £300 {{to finance}} the {{construction}} of <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> what was then known as the 'Wiltshire County Ground', this investment was enough to begin development of a purpose-built football ground. Since its original construction, the ground has been periodically updated with new features or fittings. A cover on the Shrivenham Road side was erected in 1932, followed by the current roof at the Town End. This cost £4,300, which was raised by the Supporters' Club, and was opened on 27 August 1938 by local MP, W.W. Wakefield.|$|E

Brennan wants Ted and Dougal to show that the Catholic Church has made <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> it, and considers this matter of utmost importance as he had to be recalled from his holiday in California to deal with it.|$|E
25|$|The Frankfurt School avoided taking <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> {{the precise}} {{relationship}} between the materialist and transcendental methods, which led to ambiguity in their writings and confusion among their readers. Habermas's epistemology synthesizes these two traditions by showing that phenomenological and transcendental analysis can be subsumed under a materialist theory of social evolution, while the materialist theory makes sense only {{as part of a}} quasi-transcendental theory of emancipatory knowledge that is the self-reflection of cultural evolution. The simultaneously empirical and transcendental nature of emancipatory knowledge becomes the foundation stone of critical theory.|$|E
25|$|After the American {{occupation}} of New Mexico, Albuquerque had a federal garrison and quartermaster depot, the Post of Albuquerque, from 1846 to 1867.

During his retreat from Union troops into Texas he made <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> April 8, 1862, at Albuquerque and fought the Battle of Albuquerque against a detachment of Union soldiers commanded by Colonel Edward R.
