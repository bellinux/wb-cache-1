25|$|As Abosso {{settled in}} the water, she {{temporarily}} righted herself, her crew got her emergency generator working, and her floodlights were switched on to help the evacuation. Almost immediately after this, U-575 fired a torpedo {{from one of her}} stern torpedo tubes, which hit Abosso at 22:28 (Berlin time) forward of her bridge. At 2305 hrs (Berlin time) Abosso sank bow first. The submarine then surfaced, approached the débris area, <b>and</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> boats with her searchlights. Kptlt. Heydemann reported about 10 lifeboats and 15 to 20 liferafts afloat and occupied. Heydemann did not try to question survivors to identify the ship, and claimed in his report that this was because the weather was poor.|$|E
25|$|From 1929 to 1932, the BBC {{transmitters}} {{were used}} to broadcast television programmes using the 30-line Baird system, and from 1932 to 1935, the BBC also produced the programmes in their own studio at 16 Portland Place. On 3 November 1936, from Alexandra Palace located on the high ground of the north London ridge, the BBC began alternating Baird 240-line transmissions with EMI's electronic scanning system, which had recently been improved to 405 lines after a merger with Marconi. The Baird system at the time involved an intermediate film process, where footage was shot on cinefilm, which was rapidly developed <b>and</b> <b>scanned.</b> <b>The</b> trial was due to last 6 months but the BBC ceased broadcasts with the Baird system in February 1937, {{due in part to}} a disastrous fire in the Baird facilities at Crystal Palace. It was becoming apparent to the BBC that the Baird system would ultimately fail {{due in large part to}} the lack of mobility of the Baird system's cameras, with their developer tanks, hoses, and cables.|$|E
500|$|On {{the basis}} of microtomography scans of skull {{elements}} of the holotype specimen, Sereno's team created a [...] "prototype" [...] Nigersaurus skull they could examine. They also made an endocast of the brain <b>and</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> semicircular canals of its inner ear, which they found to be oriented horizontally. In their 2007 study, they stated that {{the structure of the}} occiput and cervical vertebrae would have limited the upward and downward movement of the neck and the rotation of the skull. Based on this biomechanical analysis, the team concluded that the head and muzzle were habitually oriented 67° downwards and close to ground level, as an adaptation for ground-level browsing. This is unlike the way other sauropods have been restored, with their heads held more horizontally.|$|E

2500|$|Some of Lady Avon's friends {{may have}} {{concealed}} their true views about Suez. For example, Isaiah Berlin assured [...] "dearest Clarissa" [...] that Eden had acted with [...] "great moral splendour", describing his stance as [...] "very brave", [...] "very patriotic" [...] and [...] "absolutely just", while opining to another acquaintance that his policy had been [...] "childish folly". Lady Avon herself recalled that, though she sought to [...] "bolster up" [...] her husband <b>and</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> newspapers {{for anything that}} she thought he ought to know, she did not feel she [...] "knew enough {{about what was going}} on to try and interfere in any way". Even so, her knowledge of the inner workings of Government was such that she was able to record in her diary the precise stance, at a critical point of the Suez operation, of every member of the Cabinet:ach was asked in turn what they felt about going on. Selwyn , Alec Home, Harold , Alan , Anthony Head, Peter , [...] Eccles, Duncan , James Stuart, Gwilym , and [...] Hailsham were for going on. [...] Kilmuir, [...] Heathcoat Amory, [...] Macloed, Bobbety , Patrick Buchan-Hepburn were for doing whatever Anthony wanted and Lord Selkirk was unintelligible.|$|E
