500|$|The {{absence of}} {{character}} interaction in Myst and Riven was commented upon in reviews. Adventure Gamers called {{the lack of}} characters a bad element of the games. Conversely, Laura Miller of Salon called the isolation a distinctive and welcome touch. In comparison to contemporary games, the deep solitude allowed the player to focus on puzzles. [...] "Games with implausible and annoying characters popping up at regular intervals <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> stressful," [...] said Miller.|$|E
500|$|Eragon {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} and {{was criticized for}} its derivative nature. Liz Rosenberg of The New York Times Book Review criticized Eragon for having [...] "clichéd descriptions", [...] "B-movie dialogue", [...] "awkward and gangly" [...] prose." [...] However, she concluded the review by noting that [...] "for all its flaws, it is an authentic work of great talent". School Library Journal wrote that in Eragon [...] "sometimes the magic solutions <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> convenient for getting out of difficult situations". Common Sense Media called Eragons dialogue [...] "long-winded" [...] and [...] "clichéd", with a plot [...] "straight out of Star Wars by way of The Lord of the Rings, with bits of other great fantasies thrown in here and there." [...] The website did concede that {{the book is a}} notable achievement for such a young author, {{and that it would be}} [...] "appreciated" [...] by younger fans.|$|E
500|$|The Times {{gave the}} game four stars {{out of five}} {{and said it was}} [...] "more for 24 fans, who will {{instantly}} love it — so long as they don’t mind another TV addiction to feed." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five, stating, [...] "Newcomers to the trials and tribulations of Jack Bauer are unlikely to be impressed by this game's generic shooting and driving action. But fans of 24 will be quaking, thanks to the authentic atmosphere and gripping story, set between season two and three of the TV series." [...] However, The A.V. Club gave it a C and stated that [...] "For once, you'll wish you could skip the action to get to the cutscenes." [...] Detroit Free Press gave it a similar score of two stars out of four and said: [...] "The controls <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> unpolished to make it worthwhile, though. Movements are flaky, and aiming is far too loose. Sometimes, I got into a tight firefight where I couldn't hit a terrorist a few feet in front of me. And the driving missions are worse." ...|$|E

500|$|When Lisa {{develops}} stomach aches, she visits Dr. Hibbert, who {{suggests he}} could prescribe 'harsh Antacids' but says herbal tea could also work. Lisa wants the tea but Homer, scoffs at the tea and demands the antacids. While leaving the office Lisa {{has had enough}} and snaps at her father for belittling everything she believes in. When Lisa sees how she upset him, she says that they <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> different and will eventually drift apart. To make things up to her, Homer takes her to a local New Age store which introduces Homer and Lisa to water-filled sensory deprivation tanks, where they experience their own spiritual journey. On her journey, Lisa sees herself from Homer's perspective, reprimanding him for snoring during a ballet recital. Lisa realizes that despite his boorish personality, Homer loves Lisa enough {{to take her to}} events and places that he does not personally like just so she can be happy. Meanwhile, a pair of repo men start to clean out the store despite the lease not being up for months, taking the tank that Homer is in. Homer's [...] "journey" [...] becomes a real one, as his tank falls {{out of the back of}} the van. Mistaken by the Flanders' as a coffin, they bury him, only for the tank to fall through the soil and into a pipe where it is washed up onto the beach. Chief Wiggum finds it and returns it to the store. Lisa decides to go and do something they both enjoy. But they end up at a demolition derby together, even though Homer is the only fan.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, debutant {{director}} Bala {{offered him}} {{the role of}} the rogue, Sethu (Chiyaan), in the film Sethu. To prepare for the character, Vikram shaved his head, lost twenty-one kilograms and grew his nails long for the role. [...] After beginning production in April 1997, the film went through development hell after industry strikes and lack of funds hampered progress. During this phase, he did not accept other acting offers {{in order to maintain the}} continuity of his looks. The film then struggled to find a distributor, who shunned it due to the tragic climax and the film remained unreleased. Vikram described the period of production as [...] "the worst phase of his career" [...] as he was financially strapped and [...] "his fire was in danger of dying down". He turned down an opportunity from a friend to take up a job in technology and attempted to stay in the industry by directing a serial titled Mounam Pesiyadhey, with Ameer as his assistant director. Sethu finally released in December 1999 and initially began running at a single noon show at a suburban theater but gradually gained an audience through word-of-mouth publicity. Eventually it ran for over one hundred days at several cinema halls across Chennai. Vikram was constantly being mobbed by people on the streets as a result of the film's success. Critics praised Vikram's performance with a reviewer referring to Vikram as [...] "a revelation" [...] and that [...] "he is very natural and his acting in last few scenes <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> good and could even be compared with the best we have seen". Similarly, a critic from the Malaysian daily, New Straits Times, described the film as an [...] "unforgettable experience" [...] and described Vikram's performance as [...] "praise-worthy". The performance drew accolades with Vikram winning the Filmfare Special Award– South and the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for his portrayal of the title character, while reports emerged that he missed out on the National Film Award for Best Actor by a single vote to Mohanlal. Post-Sethu, Vikram has described the film would have been close to him regardless of its commercial success and that it put him on the [...] "right path", with Vikram choosing to adapt the prefix of Chiyaan to his screen name.|$|E

2500|$|An alpha {{particle}} is a sub-microscopic, positively charged particle of matter. According to Thomson's model, if an {{alpha particle}} were {{to collide with}} an atom, it would just fly straight through, its path being deflected by at most {{a fraction of a}} degree. At the atomic scale, the concept of [...] "solid matter" [...] is meaningless, so the alpha particle would not bounce off the atom like a marble; it would be affected only by the atom's electric fields, and Thomson's model predicted that the electric fields in an atom <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> weak to affect a passing alpha particle much (alpha particles tend to move very fast). Both the negative and positive charges within the Thomson atom are spread out over the atom's entire volume. [...] According to Coulomb's Law, the less concentrated a sphere of electric charge is, the weaker its electric field at its surface will be.|$|E

Cash wrote three of the songs himself and one {{with the help of}} Johnny Horton, but the majority of the protest songs were written by folk artist Peter La Farge (son of activist and Pulitzer prizewinner Oliver La Farge), whom Cash met in New York in the 1960s and whom he admired for his activism. The album's single, [...] "The Ballad of Ira Hayes," [...] was neglected by non-political radio at the time, and the record label denied it any promotion due to its provocative protesting and thus [...] "unappealing" [...] nature. Cash faced resistance and was even urged by an editor of a country music magazine to leave the Country Music Association: [...] "You and your crowd <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> intelligent to associate with plain country folks, country artists, and country DJs." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{slump in}} {{popularity}} led many publishers and developers to see adventure games as financially unfeasible in comparison. Notably, Sierra {{was sold to}} CUC International in 1998, and while still a separate studio, attempted to recreate an adventure game using 3D graphics, , as well as Gabriel Knight 3, both of which fared poorly; the studio was subsequently closed in 1999. Similarly, LucasArts released Grim Fandango to many positive reviews but poor sales; it released one more title, Escape from Monkey Island in 2000, but subsequently stopped development of Sam & Max: Freelance Police and had no further plans for adventure games. Many of those developers for LucasArts, including Grossman and Schafer, left the company during this time. Sierra developer Lori Ann Cole stated in 2003 her belief that {{the high cost of}} development hurt adventure games: [...] "They <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> art intensive, and art is expensive to produce and to show. Some of the best of the Adventure Games were criticized they were just too short. Action-adventure or Adventure Role-playing games can get away with re-using a lot of the art, and stretching the game play." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since 2006, The Asylum—a {{production}} company founded in 1997—has specialized in low-budget pictures also {{inspired by the}} big-budget films that have largely usurped the B movie's place in the theatrical market. The company makes what one critic dubbed [...] "mockbusters", straight-to-video knockoffs of major studio action pictures: Transformers, for instance, is transformed into The Asylum's Transmorphers. Another commercial relative of the fan film is the overt B-movie homage. Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's Grindhouse (2007) nods {{to a wide variety}} of exploitation styles popular from the late 1960s through the early 1980s. Criticizing the film, notwithstanding its [...] "posture of cool," [...] as yet another [...] "blockbuster B-movie," [...] Adario Strange places it in historical context: [...] "Despite themselves, Tarantino and Rodriguez have the right idea. As the tools for filmmaking have become cheaper and more malleable, now is the time for rough, ugly, experimental films to shine again as they did in the '70s. The problem for these directors is that they <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> rich, too well-connected and too self-aware to produce films that are truly spit and chewing gum, bleeding-edge like Eric Nicholas' Alone With Her, Vincent Gallo's The Brown Bunny or Shane Carruth's Primer—films most Americans will never see." ...|$|E
2500|$|La Russa {{says it is}} {{important}} that relievers know their roles and the situations which they will be called into a game. He added, [...] "Sure, games can get away from you in the seventh and eighth, but those last three outs in the ninth are the toughest. You want the guy who can handle that pressure. That, to me, is most important." [...] Oakland general manager Billy Beane said there would be too much media criticism if a pitcher other than the closer lost the game in the ninth." [...] Managerial moves are immediately questioned with millions of fans having access to ESPN, the MLB Network, and other cable channels. Former manager Jim Fregosi said managers do not like to be second-guessed. [...] "Even if you know the odds, it's more comfortable being wrong {{when you go to the}} closer", said Beane. [...] He noted the incremental increase gained by a closer in a three-run save situation [...] "is worth it because losing is so painful in that situation." [...] Baseball announcer Chris Wheeler noted that there is pressure on managers to pitch closers in the ninth inning when they were paid big money to pitch in that role. Former general manager Pat Gillick said closers become one-inning pitchers as managers began copying the practice of having setup pitchers enter before closers. [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> many specialists, guys who can only pitch one inning and only pitch certain innings and throw only 20 pitches. I think most pitchers are capable of pitching more", said Gillick.|$|E
