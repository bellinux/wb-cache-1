5|$|Lit torches (burning sticks) {{were likely}} the {{earliest}} form of incendiary device. They {{were followed by}} incendiary <b>arrows,</b> which were used throughout the ancient and medieval periods. The simplest flaming <b>arrows</b> had oil- or resin-soaked tows tied just below the arrowhead and were effective against wooden structures. Both the Assyrians and the Judeans used fire <b>arrows</b> at the siege of Lachish in 701 BC. More sophisticated devices were developed by the Romans which had iron boxes and tubes which were filled with incendiary substances and attached to <b>arrows</b> or spears. These <b>arrows</b> needed to be shot from loose bows, since swift flight extinguished the flame; spears could be launched by hand or throwing machine.|$|E
5|$|After the Lancastrians {{had ceased}} loosing their <b>arrows,</b> Fauconberg ordered his archers {{to step forward}} again to shoot. When they had {{exhausted}} their ammunition, the Yorkists plucked <b>arrows</b> off {{the ground in front}} of them—arrows loosed by their foes—and continued loosing. Coming under attack without any effective response of its own, the Lancastrian army moved from its position to engage the Yorkists in close combat. Seeing the advancing mass of men, the Yorkist archers shot a few more volleys before retreating behind their ranks of men-at-arms, leaving thousands of <b>arrows</b> in the ground to hinder the Lancastrian attack.|$|E
5|$|During the British Civil Wars (mid-17th {{century in}} Great Britain), both the Parliamentarian and Royalist armies used various {{incendiary}} devices to attack enemies and destroy property {{that might be}} used for military purposes, according to historian Stephen Porter in Destruction in the English Civil Wars. The flaming arrow attack was used to set fire to buildings at a distance. An arrow with a flammable substance attached to the shaft, close to the tip, was shot from a bow or short-muzzled musket. Such <b>arrows</b> shot from a musket had their feathers removed, to fit inside the muzzle, and were called fire-darts. These devices were cheap to make and easy to prepare. Although used infrequently during the wars, the flaming <b>arrows</b> and darts proved to be destructive. The Royalists shot flaming <b>arrows</b> into the thatched homes {{in the suburbs of}} Chester causing extensive damage. Lyme Regis was partly razed using flaming <b>arrows.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{phase diagram}} and thermal expansion of EuSe is revisited using a high-quality 3200 -angstrom-thick epitaxial film grown over a (111) BaF 2 substrate. Resonant magnetic x-ray diffraction experiments reveal a highly hysteretic magnetic phase diagram between 1. 8 and T-N similar to 4. 7 K, {{in which two}} antiferromagnetic phases with propagation vectors (k) over right <b>arrow</b> (I) =[(1) /(4), (1) /(4),-(1) /(4) ] (represented by up <b>arrow</b> up <b>arrow</b> down <b>arrow</b> down <b>arrow)</b> and (k) over right <b>arrow</b> (II) =[(1) /(2),(1) /(2),-(1) /(2) ](up down <b>arrow</b> up down <b>arrow)</b> are observed.

Details of the temperature dependence of (k) over right <b>arrow</b> (III) and corresponding peak widths indicate this phase is intermediate between up <b>arrow</b> up <b>arrow</b> down <b>arrow</b> down <b>arrow</b> (h=(1) /(4)) and an ideal ferrimagnetic up <b>arrow</b> up <b>arrow</b> down <b>arrow</b> phase (h=(1) /(3)), and may be represented by (n x up <b>arrow</b> up <b>arrow</b> down arrow+down <b>arrow),</b> with mean n values between 7 and 2.
