40|$|Description The {{purpose of}} this package {{is to be able}} to save and load only the needed variables/columns of a dataframe in special binary files (tar archives) - which seems to be <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>faster</b> method <b>than</b> loading the whole binary object (Rdata files) via load() function, or than loading columns from SQLite/MySQL {{databases}} via SQL commands (see vignettes- TODO!). Performance gain on SSD drives is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more sensible compared to basic load() function. The performance improvement gained by loading only the chosen variables in binary format can be useful in some special cases (e. g. where merging data tables is not an option and very different datasets are needed for reporting),but be sure if using this package that you really need this, as non-standard file formats are used!

2500|$|In April 2008, NFL draft expert Mel Kiper Jr. named Ringer as {{the best}} back {{in the class of}} 2009. However, when Mel Kiper revised his 2009 draft choices in February 2009, Ringer was not listed among Kiper's top five running backs. It was {{revealed}} Ringer has been playing on a torn lateral meniscus, which he had surgery on six days after the season ended. Ringer has said he has worked out at the combine with his knee at [...] "80%". Ringer skipped the 2009 Senior Bowl because of his injury. Despite the injury, Ringer chose to participate in the 40-yard dash at the NFL combine. He clocked in at 4.59. Ringer was quoted as saying [...] "I personally was disappointed because I know I'm <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> that. But I was able to do that just coming off knee surgery, so if I look at it that way, I'm happy." [...] He finished third among running backs in the 20-yard shuttle (4.11 seconds) and fifth in the three-cone drill (6.87 seconds). During the combine, Ringer said he interviewed with 12 teams. ESPN.com ranked him as the 8th best running back in the draft. When Scouts Inc. graded Ringer, they gave him a 1 (Exceptional) in Character. They said of Ringer, [...] "No off-the-field issues we are aware of. Coaches and teammates have only positive things to say about him. Outstanding intangibles." [...] Ringer was a projected 3rd Round pick. Another site lists him as a mid-second round draft choice. Ringer has drawn comparisons to NFL players Mike Hart and Chester Taylor. His strengths are listed as build, toughness, and patience, while his weaknesses are listed as height, breakaway speed, open field elusiveness, and injuries. A Dayton Daily News article states that Ringer is [...] "Still projected as a 2nd-rounder", despite the injury. The same article states that Ringer interviewed with the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals at the NFL combine.|$|E

50|$|Until {{the release}} of the 386, {{protected}} mode did not offer a direct method to switch back into real mode once protected mode was entered. IBM devised a workaround (implemented in the IBM AT) which involved resetting the CPU via the keyboard controller and saving the system registers, stack pointer and often the interrupt mask in the real-time clock chip's RAM. This allowed the BIOS to restore the CPU to a similar state and begin executing code before the reset. Later, a triple fault was used to reset the 286 CPU, which was <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>faster</b> and cleaner <b>than</b> the keyboard controller method (and does not depend on IBM AT-compatible hardware, but will work on any 80286 CPU in any system).|$|R

A head enforcer for the Jokerz gang, he's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> stronger and <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> his flabby gut would lead one to believe. True to his sadistic nature, Chucko's face is always hidden behind his mocking clown mask (Aside from the heist at Wayne Enterprises, where {{he was wearing a}} gas mask). He uses a bazooka as a weapon. An alternate-time stream version of Chucko appears in the Justice League Unlimited episode [...] "The Once and Future Thing" [...] Pt. 2. He appears here with a hovering ball instead of his normal legs and carries a lightsaber-like object. The ball offers more maneuverability than he previously had with his legs and the saber adds extra [...] "oomph." [...] He betrays Chronos by tipping off the Justice League Unlimited and is sent back to the prehistoric age at the moment when the meteor that killed the dinosaurs arrived. This incident serves as a warning to the other Jokerz members.|$|R

50|$|The {{abandonment}} of the Group C fuel consumption regulations meant a change in aerodynamic design philosophy.
