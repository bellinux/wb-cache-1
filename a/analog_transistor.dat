The logical operation OR is performed by applying consecutively the two arithmetic operations addition and comparison (the input resistor network acts as a parallel voltage summer with equally weighted inputs and the following common-emitter transistor stage as a voltage comparator with a threshold about 0.7 V). The equivalent resistance of all the resistors connected to logical [...] "1" [...] and the equivalent resistance of all the resistors connected to logical [...] "0" [...] form the two legs of a composed voltage divider driving the transistor. The base resistances {{and the number of}} the inputs are chosen (limited) so that only one logical [...] "1" [...] is sufficient to create base-emitter voltage exceeding the threshold and, as a result, saturating the transistor. If all the input voltages are low (logical [...] "0"), the transistor is cut-off. The pull-down resistor R1 biases the transistor to the appropriate on-off threshold. The output is inverted since the collector-emitter voltage of transistor Q1 is taken as output, and is high when the inputs are low.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Complex digital {{circuits}} such as microprocessors typically require support circuitry that {{has traditionally been}} realized using analog or mixed-signal macros. PLL circuits are used in many integrated applications such as frequency synthesizers and inter-chip communication interfaces. As process technologies advance and grow in complexity, the challenge of maintaining required analog elements and performance for use in circuits such as PLLs grows. Recently, digital PLL (DPLL) has emerged {{as an alternative to}} analog PLL to overcome many constraints such as low supply voltage, poor <b>analog</b> <b>transistor</b> behavior, larger area due to integrated capacitor and process variability. However, DPLLs have high deterministic jitter due to quantization noise of time-to-digital converter (TDC) and digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO) and struggle with random jitter of oscillator. In this thesis, hybrid analog/digital proportional/integral control is used to suppress TDC quantization error and digital phase accumulation techniques to mitigate DCO quantization error. VCO phase noise was reduced using an embedded voltage-mode feedback. This feedback loop is implemented by using a switched-C circuit which converts frequency to current. Designed in a 130 nm CMOS process, the proposed DPLL generates more than 1 GHz output frequency with low input frequency and achieves superior jitter performance compared to conventional DPLL in simulations...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU community at author's request from Dec. 1, 2010 - Dec. 1, 2011 Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs) are essential building blocks in many communication systems. Designing high performance analog PLLs {{in the presence of}} technology imposed constraints such as leakage, poor <b>analog</b> <b>transistor</b> behavior, process variability, and low supply voltage is a challenging task. To overcome these drawbacks, digital PLLs (DPLLs) have recently emerged as an alternative to analog PLLs. In this work, a digital PLL employing a linear proportional path and a double integral path is proposed to achieve low jitter, wide operating range and low power. Moreover, the approach of bandwidth and tuning range tracking is achieved. The prototype DPLL fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS process operates from 0. 7 to 3. 5 GHz. At 2. 5 GHz, the proposed DPLL consumes only 1. 6 mW power and achieves 1. 6 ps r. m. s jitter. Moreover, the design techniques for a novel digital clock and data recovery (CDR) with linear loop dynamics are presented. The PLL-based digital CDR avoid the use of TDC, achieves static phase offset free (SPO-free) and well-controlled jitter transfer bandwidth. The prototype digital CDR fabricated in a 0 : 13 μm CMOS process achieves error-free operation (BER < 10 ⁻¹²) for PRBS data sequences ranging from 2 ⁷- 1 to 2 ³¹- 1 and a near-constant bandwidth of 4. 5 MHz...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a technique}} for operational calibration of mixed-signal integrated circuits (IC) using a configurable <b>analog</b> <b>transistor</b> (CAT). The robustness obtained using this technique show {{a significant improvement}} over conventional approaches by using a CAT in the most appropriate sections of the design. This approach demonstrates significant benefits for operational calibration compared to traditional design techniques without requiring an excessive area overhead to achieve it. This technique can be used equally well to address variations across an integrated circuit for individual devices or to match specific pairs of devices in a circuit. An increasing problem with decreasing process technology sizes for the analog and mixed signal designer is the intrinsic variability of devices. An important distinction with previous work in our approach {{is the ability to}} modify critical devices after manufacture, thereby giving designers the ability to not only tune for optimal performance, but also to improve the overall circuit yield by bringing variable devices back into the required specification. This is particularly helpful in remote or hostile environments where calibration and repair have been particularly problematic. The concept presented in this paper is to provide a mechanism whereby a transistor can be configured to improve the accuracy of the performance or yield by adding an incremental width to the transistor controlled by the user. It is important to state that the definition of the incremental widths is tailored to the circuit application and process and is used to calibrate the devices after manufacture. The approach is designed to achieve optimal adjustability for a particular process and set of design constraints. The architecture of the CAT is divided into 4 sections. The first section is the main transistor, the second is the (much smaller) incremental sections, which are used to obtain the tuned overall transistor size, the third is the switches to control the incremental transistors and finally there is a digital memory to store the individual configuration for each CAT device. The devices can be identified and configured using this approach after manufacture. The structure of the example CAT is implemented using a stackable approach where the transistors M 1 -M 4 are aligned vertically, with each transmission gate sandwiched between each main transistor to minimize the connection lengths. This approach is scaleable to any reasonable number of smaller configuration transistors. The design process for using the new CAT device is twofold. The first stage is to identify the devices which are most sensitive to degradation. This is done during the schematic design phase using Monte Carlo analysis of the circuit including process variations. Once the critical devices have been identified, they are replaced with CAT devices so that the overhead of configuration is minimized, and the devices can be optimally modified on IC test after manufacture...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} {{depth of}} objects causes small {{shifts in the}} left and right retinal positions of these objects, called binocular disparity. The binocular energy model has been proposed to model the response of disparity selective cells in the visual cortex. In this model, different disparities may be encoded either by a shift in the position or the phase between the monocular receptive field profiles of the two eyes. In the cat, disparity appears to be encoded primarily by phase. We have built and characterized an electronic implementation of the binocular energy model. Our system consists of two silicon retina representing {{the left and right}} eyes, two silicon chips containing retino-topic arrays of spiking neurons with monocular Gabor-type spatial receptive fields (RF), and circuits that combine the spike outputs to compute a disparity selective complex cell response. However, mismatch in the <b>analog</b> <b>transistors</b> implementing the Gabor-like neurons produce mismatch between the monocular receptive field profiles. Our measurements indicate that the relative responses between neurons tuned to different disparities are better matched in the phase based model than in the position based model. We performed a numerical sensitivity analysis that confirms that the relative responses of neurons in the phase model are more robust in the presence of monocular receptive field mismatch and that serendipitously, the robustness is greatest for those parameters of the receptive fields which vary the most on the chips. We conjecture that this robustness may be one factor explaining the preference for phase encoding in biological neuron.
