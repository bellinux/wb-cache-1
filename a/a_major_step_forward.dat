40|$|Hemophilia A and B are X-linked {{monogenic}} disorders {{resulting from}} deficiencies of factor VIII and FIX, respectively. Purified clotting factor concentrates are currently intravenously administered to treat hemophilia, but this treatment is non-curative. Therefore, gene-based therapies for hemophilia {{have been developed}} to achieve sustained high levels of clotting factor expression to correct the clinical phenotype. Over the past two decades, different types of viral and non-viral gene delivery systems have been explored for hemophilia gene therapy research with a variety of target cells, particularly hepatocytes, hematopoietic stem cells, skeletal muscle cells, and endothelial cells. Lentiviral and adeno-associated virus (AAV) -based vectors are among the most promising vectors for hemophilia gene therapy. In preclinical hemophilia A and B animal models, the bleeding phenotype was corrected with these vectors. Some of these promising preclinical results prompted clinical translation to patients suffering from a severe hemophilic phenotype. These patients receiving gene therapy with AAV vectors showed long-term expression of therapeutic FIX levels, which is <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>step</b> <b>forwards</b> in this field. Nevertheless, the levels were insufficient to prevent trauma or injury-induced bleeding episodes. Another challenge that remains is the possible immune destruction of gene-modified cells by effector T cells, which are directed against the AAV vector antigens.

40|$|The {{enormous}} {{developments in}} radiation technology open new horizons for improvements in local tumour control. However, the evolution from conventional {{external beam radiotherapy}} planning to conformal therapy might be hampered by the potential risk of over-reliance on the physician's capability of estimating the tumour extent from imaging modalities. The variability between 12 volunteering physicians in the delineation of tumour and target volume on the lateral orthogonal localisation radiograph from CT was assessed for 5 brain tumours. The estimated tumour and target sizes varied, respectively with a factor of 1. 3 - 2. 6 and with a factor of 1. 3 - 2. 1. The anatomical location of the volumes showed maximum variations from 11 to 27 mm in the cranio-caudal direction and from 14 to 21 mm in the fronto-occipital direction. For the 5 test cases, the tumour area on which all radiation oncologists agreed, represented only 25 - 73 % of the corresponding mean tumour area. Although the introduction of computed tomography in radiation treatment planning was proved to be <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>step</b> <b>forwards</b> for treatment planning in many tumour sites, {{the results of the}} present study on brain tumours demonstrate that the subjective interpretation of the tumour extent based on CT images might be one of the largest factors contributing to the overall uncertainty in radiation treatment planning.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made in the experimental and numerical analysis of viscoelastic polymer melt flow. From the numerical point of view a number of well established mixed finite element formulations have been developed that are sufficiently stable, robust and efficient to analyze a range of two and three dimensional flow problems. Typical examples are the so-called DEVSS/DG and DEVSS/SUPG methods. Experimentally, an increasing variety of flow geometries has become available, satisfying requirements such as near twodimensionality of the flow (i. e. a depth-to-height aspect ratio of at least 8 in the whole flow domain). The measurement resolution of fringe patterns has improved significantly by the application of lasers such that accurate measurements can be made at critical locations in the geometry. Furthermore, the use of Mueller calculus allows the prediction of the observable fringe patterns in three dimensional flow geometries. Crucial to the quantitative prediction of velocity and stress fields in inhomogeneous flows is the availability of reliable constitutive models. Within the class of differential models, the multi-mode versions of the Giesekus and PTT model have been the most widely applied.
