40|$|Hot {{ductility}} {{studies have}} been performed on C-Mn and C-Mn-Nb steels with an approach to simulate the effect of cooling conditions experienced by steel in secondary cooling zone during continuous casting. Thermal oscillations prior to tensile straining deteriorate hot ductility of steel by deepening and widening the hot ductility trough. C-Mn steels are found to exhibit ductility troughs in three distinct zones whereas C-Mn-Nb steel shows drop in ductility only at low temperature {{in the vicinity of}} ferrite transformation temperatures. Start of ferrite transformation in steels causes yield ratio to increase while work hardening rates and strength coefficient decrease with decrease in test temperature in presence of thermal oscillation prior to tensile testing. Inhibition of recrystallization due to build-up of AlN particles along with the presence of MnS particles in structure and low work hardening rates causes embrittlement of steel in <b>austenitic</b> <b>range.</b> Alloying elements enhancing work hardening rates in <b>austenitic</b> <b>range</b> can be promoted to improve hot ductility. The presence of low melting phase saturated with impurities along the austenitic grain boundaries causes intergranular fracture at high temperature in C-Mn steels...|$|E
40|$|This work aims at the {{experimental}} characterization and modeling validation of {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) Negator springs. According to the classic engineering books on springs, a Negator spring is a spiral spring made of strip of metal wound on the flat with an inherent curvature such that, in repose, each coil wraps tightly on its inner neighbor. The main feature of a Negator springs is the nearly constant force displacement behavior in the unwinding of the strip. Moreover the stroke is very long, theoretically infinite, as it depends only {{on the length of}} the initial strip. A Negator spring made in SMA is built and experimentally tested to demonstrate the feasibility of this actuator. The shape memory Negator spring behavior can be modeled with an analytical procedure, which is in good agreement with {{the experimental}} test and can be used for design purposes. In both cases, the material is modeled as elastic in <b>austenitic</b> <b>range,</b> while an exponential continuum law is used to describe the martensitic behavior. The experimental results confirms the applicability of this kind of geometry to the shape memory alloy actuators, and the analytical model is confirmed to be a powerful design tool to dimension and predict the spring behavior both in martensitic and <b>austenitic</b> <b>range...</b>|$|E

40|$|TRIP-assisted {{multiphase}} steels {{have been}} thoroughly {{studied in the}} cold-rolled and annealed state. The effects of hot-rolling conditions on these steels are much less studied even though these are of major importance for industrial practice. This study {{was carried out in}} order to understand the effect of the hot deformation of austenite on the tensile properties of TRIP-assisted multiphase steels. Two different compositions and microstructures are investigated. The first one is a low-carbon steel (mass content of 0. 15 %) with a microstructure consisting of an intercritical ferritic matrix, bainite and retained austenite. The second one is a medium-carbon steel (mass content of 0. 4 %) that consists of bainite and retained austenite. Both steels were deformed to various strain levels below the non-recrystallisation temperature of austenite. The medium carbon steel was deformed in the fully <b>austenitic</b> temperature <b>range</b> whereas the low-carbon steel was deformed in the intercritical temperature range. In both cases, the prior hot deformation of austenite brings about a large enhancement of the work-hardening capabilities. In the case of the medium-carbon steel, this effect can be attributed to a much larger TRIP effect taking place during straining. In the case of the low-carbon steel, the improvement of the work-hardening behaviour was attributed to an interaction between the martensitic transformation and the dislocations already present within the surrounding ferrite matrix...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear electric's NDT {{applications}} Centre, {{in collaboration}} with IzfP, Germany, has evaluated Electromagnetic Acoustic Trasnducers (EMATs) for the generation of horizontally polarized shear (SH) waves for ultrasonic inspection of <b>austenitic</b> welds. A <b>range</b> of <b>austenitic</b> weld blocks containing both realistic and artificial defects have been inspected using both angle compression wave probes and EMATs. The comparison shows that SH wave results have good {{signal to noise ratio}} for the detection of defects and the SH wave images are much "cleaner" than those for angel compression waves simplifying data interpretation. Modelling is used to explain the observed phenomena and to predict cases where SH waves might be best employed and where SH waves offer no significant benfit over compression waves.

40|$|Objectives: The {{shape memory}} {{resulting}} from the superelasticity and thermoelastic effect is the main characteristic of thermally activated NiTi archwires and {{is closely related to}} the transition temperature range (TTR). The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the TTR of thermally activated NiTi archwires commercially available. Material and Methods: Seven different brands of 0. 019 "x 0. 025 " thermally activated nickel-titanium archwires were tested as received by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) over the temperature range from - 100 &# 176;C to 150 &# 176;C at 10 &# 176;C/min. Results: All thermally activated NiTi archwires analyzed presented stage transformation during thermal scanning with final <b>austenitic</b> temperature (Af) <b>ranging</b> from 20. 39 &# 176;C to 45. 42 &# 176;C. Three brands of NiTi archwires presented Af close to the room temperature and, this way, do not present properties of shape memory and pseudoelasticity that are desirable in clinical applications. Conclusions: The thermally activated NiTi archwires present great variability in the TTR and the elastic parameters of each NiTi archwire should be provided by the manufacturers, to allow achievement of the best clinical performance possible...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to give further {{insights}} on {{the changes that}} are brought on bainite formation by prior hot-deformation. To this end, a thermomechanical treatment was performed on blocks of a 0. 4 C- 1. 5 Si- 1. 4 Mn steel, The chemistry of this alloy allowed hot-rolling in the full <b>austenitic</b> <b>range</b> up to large reductions without any significant recrystallisation, The deformed plates were then partially transformed to bainite and the resulting microstructures were subjected to investigation. The laths of bainitic ferrite appeared to be grouped in packets in which they exhibit the same crystallographic orientation. When no prior hot-deformation is applied, the bainite packets originating from the same austenite parent grain were randomly distributed. However, severely deformed austenite grains were found to give rise to typical orientations of the bainitic ferrite laths. These results were interpreted in terms of dislocation arrays interacting with a displacive transformation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Effect {{of applied}} {{thermomechanical}} rolling and heat treatment on dual-phase and multi-phase microstructure formation in steel 15 (formerly 15 GA) and achieved mechanical properties was studied. Thermomechanical rolling {{was made in}} full <b>austenitic</b> <b>range.</b> After rolling steel {{was held in the}} air for 145 s to 250 s in α+γ temperature range then quenched in water. The heat treatment of steel was based on annealing in (α+γ) range at temperature 1063 K for 3600 s, quenching in water and tempering at temperature 913 K for 5400 s. Microstructures after these treatments were composed of ferrite matrix and martensite – bainite – austenite islands. Volume fraction of islands was in the range 19 ÷ 37 % for steel after thermomechanical treatment and 22 ÷ 29 % after heat treatment. High mechanical properties were achieved: after thermomechanical rolling: TS = 910 MPa, YS = 760 MPa and El = 14, 4 %; after heat treatment: TS = 510 MPa, YS = 328 MPa and El = 37, 27 %...|$|E

40|$|A new {{finite element}} model is {{developed}} to predict the deformations, stresses, phase compositions and carbon concentration gradients that arise {{as a consequence of}} the physical processes involved in a carburization and quenching process of a large steel gear. Firstly, the diffusion of carbon at elevated temperatures in the <b>austenitic</b> <b>range</b> is studied in a diffusion model. Secondly, the calculated carbon concentration distribution is used as an input for a model that couples the thermal, metallographic and mechanical effects during the quenching process and calculates the evolution of the temperature, phase composition and deformation history at any point in the gear. Two effects typical for oil quenching of large gears are incorporated in the model. The first is the influence of the gear’s own weight while hanging on chains before, during and after entering the quench bath. The second is the three-dimensional effect that it takes time between the moment the gear enters the oil quenching bath and the moment when the gear is fully immersed. The non-uniform temperature distribution over the gear’s axis causes a non-homogeneous plastic deformation. A diffusion-thermo-metallo-mechanical model that takes these effects into account is compared with a model that does not. The results show that these effects should be incorporated. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} work studied {{the effect of}} boron additions (14, 33, 82, 126, and 214 ppm) on the hot ductility behavior of a low carbon advanced ultra-high strength steel. For this purpose, specimens were subjected to a hot tensile test at different temperatures [923 K, 973 K, 1023 K, 1073 K, 1173 K, and 1273 K (650 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C, and 1000 °C) ] under a constant true strain rate of 10 - 3 s- 1. The reduction of area (RA) of the tested samples until fracture was taken {{as a measure of}} the hot ductility. In general, results revealed a marked improvement in hot ductility from 82 ppm B when the stoichiometric composition for BN (0. 8 : 1) was exceeded. By comparing the ductility curve of the steel with the highest boron content (B 5, 214 ppm B) and the curve for the steel without boron (B 0), the increase of hot ductility in terms of RA is over 100 pct. In contrast, the typical recovery of hot ductility at temperatures below the Ar 3, where large amounts of normal transformation ferrite usually form in the structure, was not observed in these steels. On the other hand, the fracture surfaces indicated that the fracture mode tends to be more ductile as the boron content increases. It was shown that precipitates and/or inclusions coupled with voids play a meaningful role on the crack nucleation mechanism, which in turn causes hot ductility loss. In general, results are discussed in terms of boron segregation and precipitation on austenitic grain boundaries during cooling from the <b>austenitic</b> <b>range</b> and subsequent plastic deformation.

The {{results show that}} the solution treatment has a significant influence on microstructure and mechanical {{properties of}} the investigated steels. By appropriate solution treatment the product of tensile strength (Rm) and total elongation (A 50) of the hot rolled steel can be improved from ~ 40000 - 55000 MPa% to ~ 55000 - 65000 MPa% depending on the chemical composition. A solution treatment with a very high temperature, e. g. at 1100 °C for the Fe- 18. 9 Mn- 0. 62 C- 0. 02 Ti- 0. 005 B steel, results in {{a significant increase in the}} hcp-martensite fraction during quenching. This deteriorates the ductility of the steel. A solution treatment at low temperature in the <b>austenitic</b> <b>range,</b> e. g. at 700 °C for the Fe- 18. 9 Mn- 0. 62 C- 0. 02 Ti- 0. 005 B steel, results in a decrease in the grain size of the steel. This suppresses the hcp-martensitic transformation during cooling. Colour etchings and EBSD measurements revealed the mechanisms contributing to the overall plasticity of the investigated steels on the microscale. The plasticity of the Fe- 26. 5 Mn- 3. 6 Al- 2. 2 Si- 0. 38 C- 0. 005 B and Fe- 30. 0 Mn- 3. 1 Al- 1. 9 Si steels is produced mainly by TWIP mechanism under the examined experimental conditions, whereas for the Fe- 18. 9 Mn- 0. 62 C- 0. 02 Ti- 0. 005 B steel TWIP and TRIP mechanisms occur with different intensity depending on the temperature of the tensile test. For predicting deformation mechanism the stacking fault energies of the investigated steels were calculated by using a thermochemical model.
