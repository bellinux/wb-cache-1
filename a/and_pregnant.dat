40|$|Aim: The present {{work was}} carried out to study and compare the {{variation}} in physical and rheological (study of stretch and elasticity) properties of cervico-vaginal mucus of <b>pregnant</b> <b>and</b> non <b>pregnant</b> animals {{which could be used}} for early pregnancy diagnosis in buffaloes. Materials and Methods: Cervico-vaginal mucus samples were obtained from 30 buffaloes (n= 12 pregnant, n= 18 non <b>pregnant)</b> <b>and</b> a comparison was made between values of different parameters obtained from <b>pregnant</b> <b>and</b> non <b>pregnant</b> animals. Transparency, consistency, and elasticity of mucus were studied during early pregnancy. Results: Transparency and consistency did not show any remarkable difference between <b>pregnant</b> <b>and</b> non <b>pregnant</b> animals during any phase of estrous cycle. However, rheological property i. e. elasticity, showed a significant difference in its value on 9 th day of estrous cycle. Spinnbarkeit value decreased significantly in pregnant animals on 9 th day (3. 9 ± 0. 45 cm), whereas non pregnant group did not show a remarkable difference (8. 4 ± 0. 43). Spinnbarkeit value was unidentifiable from 12 th day onward in both the groups. Conclusion: These results conclude that significant variation in mucus elasticity could be helpful in designing user friendly tool for early pregnancy diagnosis in buffalo in future.

5|$|Matings are {{generally}} observed between March and May, {{but the most}} likely time of conception is April. Most mating {{takes place in the}} territories and during the day. Females have control over the copulation process, and males may have to keep mating with the same females. Females usually give birth to one young each year. Gestation lasts around 27 weeks, <b>and</b> <b>pregnant</b> females give birth between late September and November. Late births into January are sometimes observed. The altricial newborns rely on their mothers for warmth. For their first three weeks, young cling to their mothers when they go foraging. After this, the young remain in the roosts.

They first visit the Utica branch, where former Scranton employee Karen (Rashida Jones) is now regional manager. Pam, who is engaged to Karen's ex-boyfriend Jim (John Krasinski), fears the encounter will be awkward. But Karen is now married <b>and</b> <b>pregnant,</b> and the two get along very well – when Pam reveals her and Jim's engagement, Karen even offers genuine congratulations.

Eve inspects Vincent (who is dressed as Valerie) on November 22, 2007 and discovers his pregnancy and his true gender identity as intersex. Vincent torments Eve out of revenge for her failure to prevent his abduction when he was born and to prevent her from telling anyone that he was still alive <b>and</b> <b>pregnant</b> with Julian's child. After his psychopathic accomplice Viki Chatsworth severs Julian's penis, Vincent plies Eve with drugs and alcohol so she botches her attempt to surgically reattach Julian's penis; she reattaches it upside-down, and an erection might kill him. In May 2008, Eve and Julian assist Vincent with the birth of his son on the Russells' kitchen table after Eve explains everything about Vincent and Valerie to Julian. Eve plans to form a relationship again with Vincent (believing that motherhood has mellowed him), and convinces Julian not to turn him in to the police. During the rehearsal dinner for the joint weddings of Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald and Fancy Crane, Noah Bennett and Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald, Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald and Kay Bennett, and Edna Wallace and Norma Bates, Vincent and Viki kill all the guests with a poison mushroom sauce, but Tabitha gives up her powers and becomes a born again Christian in order to resurrect everyone.

On day 14 th, corpus luteum sectional area was 348. 43 mm 2 in <b>pregnant</b> <b>and</b> 387. 84 mm 2 in non pregnant cows. Within days 20 th to 23 rd, corpus luteum sectional area ranged between 342. 06 and 367. 90 mm 2 in <b>pregnant</b> <b>and</b> between 193. 85 and 270. 69 mm 2 in non pregnant cows. Plasma progesterone level was 2. 43 ng/ml in <b>pregnant</b> <b>and</b> 2. 46 ng/ml in non pregnant cows on day 14 th, while during days 20 th to 23 rd the level ranged between 2. 47 and 2. 84 ng/ml in <b>pregnant</b> <b>and</b> between 0. 53 and 1. 17 ng/ml in non pregnant cows. Results of both luteal tissue {{areas as well}} as plasma progesterone levels were highly significantly deferent (P< 0. 01) between <b>pregnant</b> <b>and</b> non <b>pregnant</b> cows during days 20 th to 23 rd, {{but there were no}} significant differences on day 14 th. The correlation between CL {{cross sectional}} area and plasma progesterone level was 0. 4 in <b>pregnant</b> cows <b>and</b> 0. 99 in non pregnant cow. It is clear, from this study, that ultrasonic assessment of corpora lutea is a viable alternative to determine plasma progesterone levels for early pregnancy diagnosis in cows.

5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) trains a {{temporary}} worker Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) {{so that she}} can take her place when she goes on maternity leave. In the break room, the other workers discuss how attractive Cathy is and how excited they are to have her in the office. Pam, being well into her pregnancy, is sensitive about her looks and so becomes offended by their discussion. Most of them respond by assuring Pam that she is, if anything, more sexually attractive than before she was pregnant. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), however, argues that sexual attractiveness is a mostly objective quality <b>and</b> <b>pregnant</b> women cannot be sexually attractive, and accuses the others of lying to spare Pam's feelings. Troubled by Dwight's comments, Pam asks her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he finds the new temp attractive. Not wanting to upset his wife, Jim tells her that he does not find her replacement attractive, even objectively. Though Jim gives no sign of unease, Pam is convinced that he is lying to her, and enlists the help of the harshly honest Dwight to prove it. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to trick Jim into revealing he finds Pam's replacement attractive, Dwight and Pam convince Jim to submit to a lie detection test {{in the form of a}} retail store's blood pressure tester. At the conclusion of the interview, Dwight triumphantly announces that he recorded hypertension when Jim said he does not find the new temp attractive, but as Jim continues to insist he is telling the truth Dwight admits that he recorded equal hypertension on every question, including Jim's name. Pam realizes that Jim has unusually high blood pressure, which his father also suffers from, and forgets about the issue in order to focus on her husband's health.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} {{compartments}} that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life {{of lead in}} these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone. Lead in the bones, teeth, hair, and nails is bound tightly and not available to other tissues, and is generally thought not to be harmful. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children. The estimated half-life of lead in bone is 20 to 30years, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone. The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40days, {{but it may be}} longer in children <b>and</b> <b>pregnant</b> women, whose bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream. Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.|$|E
