5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-4b's {{discovery}} was announced on January 4, 2010. It {{is the size}} of planet Neptune, at 0.077 MJ (7% the mass of Jupiter) and 0.357 RJ (36% the radius of Jupiter). The planet orbits its star every 3.214 days at 0.045 AU from the star. This distance compares to planet Mercury, which is 0.39 AU from the Sun. Kepler-4's eccentricity was <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 0, however a subsequent independent reanalysis of the discovery data found a value of 0.25 ± 0.12. Likewise, the temperature of the planet is <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 1650 K, far hotter than Jupiter's, which is <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 124 K (not considering its internal heat and atmosphere).|$|E

5|$|Heine's prose {{passage in}} De l'Allemagne tells of supernatural young women called the Wilis.

In another book, the Wilis are said to be jilted young women who have died and become vampires. This is <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the reason that they hate men.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Sarcosphaera coronaria {{has been}} <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> saprobic, {{acquiring}} nutrients from breaking down decaying organic matter.

The results of a 2006 study of Pezizalean fungi further suggest that the species is an ectomycorrhizal symbiont, and more generally, that the Pezizales include more ectomycorrhizal fungi than previously thought.|$|E
