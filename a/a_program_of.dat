5|$|After World War II, the Philippines {{was for a}} time {{regarded}} as the second wealthiest in East Asia, next only to Japan. In the 1960s its economic performance started being overtaken.

5|$|From autumn 1943 the Japanese {{government}} took further steps {{to prepare the}} country's major cities for air attacks. An air defense general headquarters was established in November and <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>of</b> demolishing large numbers of buildings in major cities to create firebreaks began the next month. By {{the end of the}} war 614,000 housing units had been destroyed to clear firebreaks; these accounted for a fifth of all housing losses in Japan during the war and displaced 3.5 million people. The government also encouraged old people, children and women in cities that were believed likely to be attacked to move to the countryside from December 1943, and <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>of</b> evacuating entire classes of schoolchildren was implemented. By August 1944, 330,000 schoolchildren had been evacuated in school groups and another 459,000 had moved to the countryside with their family. Little was done to disperse industrial facilities to make them less vulnerable to attack, however, as this was logistically difficult.|$|E

5|$|After the British army {{captured}} Palestine {{from the}} Ottomans in 1917-1918, Bayt Jibrin resumed {{its role as}} an important town in the District of Hebron. The population was entirely Muslim, and had two schools, a medical clinic, a bus and a police station. The town's inhabitants cultivated grain and fruit, and residents from nearby towns flocked to its weekly market or souk. During the winter of 1920-1921 there was a severe outbreak of malaria. 157 villagers (one-sixth of the population) died with the mortality rate in the district reaching 68 per 1,000. Crops remained unharvested {{due to lack of}} people strong enough to work in the fields. The new British regime began <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>of</b> sealing open wells, improving drainage and distributing quinine across Palestine. In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Bayt Jibrin had a population of 1,420, all Muslim, increasing the 1931 census to 1,804, still all Muslim, in a total of 369 houses.|$|E

5|$|After the Civil War, the Corps of Engineers {{undertook}} <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>of</b> {{river and}} harbor improvements.

He also helped supervise several harbor dredging and construction projects, involving the harbor in Buffalo, New York, the Harbor of Refuge in New Buffalo, Michigan, Erie Harbor in Erie, Pennsylvania, {{and the river}} harbors of St. Louis, Missouri and Alton, Illinois. Raynolds sited and oversaw the installation of dozens of lighthouses in the Great Lakes area, where he served as the superintending engineer from 1864 to 1870. Raynolds was promoted to permanent rank of lieutenant colonel in the Corps of Engineers on March 7, 1867. He then supervised lighthouse construction along the Gulf Coast and in New Jersey where he managed {{the construction of the}} Hereford Inlet Lighthouse in 1874. From May 5 to October 7, 1877, Reynolds led a procession of American engineers to an engineering conference in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Although {{military}} {{reform was}} delayed {{until the end}} of his reign, Leopold did succeed in convincing parliament of the need to extend Belgium's defenses. Construction of fortresses along the border by both the French and Germans in the mid-1880s worried the Belgian government that their country might be used as an invasion route. In 1887, <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>of</b> fortification construction began along the Sambre and Meuse rivers. Designed by the leading military architect Henri Alexis Brialmont, nine forts were built at Namur to guard against an offensive from France, while twelve were built around Liège, near the German border. Completed in 1892, they supplemented the existing National Redoubt at Antwerp, which was later modernized and extended. The fortifications would {{play a major role in}} the opening stages of the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Article {{five of the}} Constitution {{declared}} Catholicism to be {{the state}} religion. However, the clergy had long been understaffed, undisciplined and poorly educated, all of {{which led to a}} general loss of respect for the Catholic Church. During PedroII's reign, the Imperial government embarked upon <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>of</b> reform designed to address these deficiencies. As Catholicism was the official religion, the Emperor exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs and paid clerical salaries, appointed parish priests, nominated bishops, ratified papal bulls and supervised seminaries. In pursuing reform, the government selected bishops whose moral fitness, stance on education and support for reform met with their approval. However, as more capable men began to fill the clerical ranks, resentment of government control over the Church increased. Catholic clerics moved closer to the Pope and his doctrines. This resulted in the Religious Question, a series of clashes during the 1870s between the clergy and the government, since the former wanted a more direct relationship with Rome and the latter sought to maintain its oversight of church affairs.|$|E
