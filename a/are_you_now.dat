500|$|For Angels fifth season, as with Buffys fourth, Spike {{steps in}} to replace Cordelia {{as a source}} of comedic {{dialogue}} within the series. It is also noted by critics that, in the fifth season, [...] "it doesn't take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia, giving everyone the cold and honest truth whether they want it or not". Concerning Cordelia's last appearance in Angels fifth and final season, Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the [...] "mission statement" [...] of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to—through Cordelia, who was [...] "there at the beginning"—ask of Angel, [...] "Where <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>now?</b> Where were you when you started and where <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>now</b> and {{how do you feel about}} that?" [...] The return to the show's [...] "original concerns" [...] is echoed by the flashback to Doyle's first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel [...] "You forgot who you are," [...] bringing back the show's link to the city. Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode to get Angel 'back on track', but Sarah Michelle Gellar had other obligations. Writer/director David Fury explains that since [...] "we couldn't get Sarah" [...] the episode was instead written for Cordelia. He adds, [...] "This turned out to be a Godsend because Charisma was fantastic." [...] In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because [...] "the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon," [...] says Fury.|$|E

2500|$|In several countries, {{immediately}} after [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] has been sung, it is traditional {{for one of}} the guests to enthusiastically lead with [...] "Hip hip..." [...] and then for all of the other guests to join in and say [...] "... hooray!" [...] This is normally repeated three times. In Canada, especially at young children's birthdays, {{immediately after}} [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] has been sung, the singers segue into [...] "How old <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>now?</b> How old <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>now?</b> How old are you now-ow, how old are you now?" [...] and then count up: [...] "Are you one? Are you two? Are you..." [...] until they reach the right age, at which the celebrant says [...] "yes", and everybody else, who presumably know the right number, all cheer.|$|E
