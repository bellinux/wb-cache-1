60|$|Also it is {{important}} to put the happiness of the children rather carefully in its place, which is really not a front place. The unsympathetic, selfish, hard people who regard happiness as a very exceptional indulgence to which children are by no means entitled, though they may be allowed a very little of it on their birthdays or at Christmas, are sometimes better parents in effect than those who imagine that children are as capable of happiness as adults. Adults habitually exaggerate their own capacity in that direction grossly; yet most adults can stand an allowance of happiness that would be quite thrown away on children. The secret of being miserable is to have leisure to bother <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> are happy or not. The cure for it is occupation, because occupation means pre-occupation; and the pre-occupied person is neither happy nor unhappy, but simply alive and active, which is pleasanter than any happiness until you are tired of it. That is why it is necessary to happiness that one should be tired. Music after dinner is pleasant: music before breakfast is so unpleasant as to be clearly unnatural. To people who are not overworked holidays are a nuisance. To people who are, and who can afford them, they are a troublesome necessity. A perpetual holiday is a good working definition of hell.|$|E

TransCanada CEO Russ Girling has argued that [...] "the U.S. needs 10 {{million barrels a day}} of imported oil" [...] and the debate over the proposed pipeline [...] "is not a debate of oil versus alternative energy. This is a debate <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> want to get your oil from Canada or Venezuela or Nigeria." [...] However, an independent study conducted by the Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute refers to some studies (e.g. a 2011 study by Danielle Droitsch of Pembina Institute) according to which [...] "a good portion of the oil that will gush down the KXL will probably end up being finally consumed beyond the territorial United States".

They reckon that it cost 30 million lives to build new China. The West should have a bit more gratitude for the struggle of the Chinese. If it wasn’t for the resistance in China during the Second World War, the Japanese would have had tens of thousands more men and they may have got as far as Australia and New Zealand. Back then sides were clear-cut. They were clearer even before the war, if you had the wit to see it. I became involved in China’s struggle and I chose my side. After the war and the revolution, I knew I had a choice. I could have joined the critics of China, but China had become like my family and as in all families, even though you might have been arguing with each other, when the guests come you present a loyal unified face to the world.

On {{the eve of the}} 2010 general election, The Independent supported the Liberal Democrats, arguing that [...] "they are longstanding and convincing champions of civil liberties, sound economics, international co-operation on the great global challenges and, of course, fundamental electoral reform. These are all principles that this newspaper has long held dear. That is why we argue that there is a strong case for progressively minded voters to lend their support to the Liberal Democrats wherever there is a clear opportunity for that party to win". However, the weekend before the 2015 general election saw The Independent on Sunday claim it would not be advising its readers how to vote in 2015. The editorial piece claimed that [...] "this {{does not mean that we}} are a bloodless, value-free news-sheet. We have always been committed to social justice", but the paper recognised that it was up the readers to [...] "make up your own mind <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> agree with us or not". Rather than support a particular party, the paper urged all its reader to vote as [...] "a responsibility of common citizenship". On 4 May 2015, the weekday version of The Independent said that a continuation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition after the general election would be a positive outcome.|$|E
40|$|The {{epistemology}} {{of disagreement}} concerns the normative {{question of how}} you ought to revise your beliefs in a very specific epistemic context.

How are you to respond should you subse-quently discover that your peer disagrees with you? Advocates of the Equal Weight view state that in light of known peer disagreement <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> P, <b>you</b> ought to revise your opinion {{in such a way as}} to “split the difference” between your own view and that of your peer’s. 1 Let us call this the Equal Weight rule, or EWR.

Seyranian and colleagues collected survey data at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the semester from three sections of an undergraduate physics course. Interestingly, the women in their study reported they felt a stronger sense of belonging at the university than they did in physics, showing the strong impact of environment on sense of belonging. They also showed that identification with the field of physics is related to psychological well-being (flourishing) and academic achievement. Women who did identify with physics tended to not only perform well, but “flourish,” which is a construct from social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner 1979) that refers to an optimal range of human functioning that is associated with “generativity, growth, and resilience” (Fredrickson and Losada 2005, p. 678).|$|E
40|$|Somehow, it is {{understood}} that prosecutors have the high ground. Most people simply assume that prosecutors are the good guys, wear the white hats, and are on the 2 ̆ 2 right 2 ̆ 2 side. Most law students contemplating a career in criminal law seem to think this. It could be that most practicing lawyers think this, as well. Prosecutors represent the people, the state, the government. This is very noble, important, and heady stuff. Prosecutors seek truth, justice, and the American way. They {{are the ones who}} stand up for the victims and would-be victims, the bullied and battered and burgled. They protect all of us. Defenders are always on the defensive. In a social climate that exalts crime control over everything else, defenders are barely tolerated. It is sometimes hard for the public to distinguish defenders from the 2 ̆ 2 scum 2 ̆ 2 we represent. We are often seen as our clients 2 ̆ 7 accomplices or, at best, their apologists. Much has been written <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> can be a good person and a good defender [...] that is, whether it is morally acceptable to defend people who do bad things [...] and what the personal and professional dilemmas are for those who engage in such work. Almost nothing has been written <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> can be a good person and a good prosecutor [...] that is, whether it is morally acceptable to prosecute people who do bad things. At the heart of this question is the reality that prosecution inevitably leads to punishment, which, in recent times, means locking people up (especially some people) for very long periods of time, and, with increased regularity, executing them. In this article, the author examines the morality of prosecution. First, she explores the context of criminal lawyering at the millennium {{and what it means to}} prosecute under current conditions. Then, she discusses whether it is possible to do 2 ̆ 2 good 2 ̆ 2 in this context [...] that is, whether a well-intentioned prosecutor can temper the harsh reality of the criminal justice system [...] in view of the institutional and cultural pressures of prosecutor offices.

40|$|Plagiarism {{is using}} someone else’s work without giving {{credit to the}} {{original}} source. If you take a phrase or sentence or paragraph from another source and include it in your own work without citing the original source, then that’s plagiarism. If you take an idea from another source and include it in your own work without citing the original source, that’s also plagiarism. It doesn’t matter if the original source is a book, a journal article, a web site, or another student, you are still presenting someone else’s work as your own and therefore you are plagiarizing. Even if you rephrase a sentence, paragraph, or idea, it is still plagiarism if you don’t give credit to the original source. As the 6 th edition of the APA Publication Manual states, “each time you paraphrase another author (i. e., summarize a passage or rearrange the order of sentences and change some of the words), you need to credit the source ” (APA, 2010, p. 15).
