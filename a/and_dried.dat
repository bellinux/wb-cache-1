5|$|Maraba's coffee {{plants are}} the Bourbon {{variety of the}} Coffea arabica species and are grown on fertile {{volcanic}} soils on high-altitude hills.

5|$|Piccadilly was {{increasingly}} developed {{and by the}} middle of the 18th century it was continuously built on as far as Hyde Park Corner. The development of St James's and Mayfair in particular made Piccadilly into one of the busiest roads in London. Hugh Mason and William Fortnum started the Fortnum & Mason partnership on Piccadilly in 1705, selling recycled candles from Buckingham Palace. By 1788, the store sold poultry, potted meats, lobsters and prawns, savoury patties, Scotch eggs, and fresh <b>and</b> <b>dried</b> fruits.|$|E

5|$|A 1990 CDOT design {{proposal}} for a new bridge was dropped after heavy opposition. In 2004 the city of Aspen {{and the town of}} Snowmass jointly funded design work for another new bridge. CDOT expedited the planning process for the bridge and work began the next year. Construction of the segmental concrete box-girder replacement was complicated by the need to protect the wetlands below, a problem that was solved by building the bridge from the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers to be poured <b>and</b> <b>dried</b> during winter.|$|E

5|$|As the {{blizzard}} progressed, Patrick Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped off his clothes, {{and ran into}} the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat.

The {{effects of}} {{chemical}} (nitrogen and phosphorus) and biological fertilizers (Rhizobium and vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae [VAM] (Glomus sp.) on growth and symbiotic properties of faba bean under saline conditions were investigated in two pot experiments. Salinity significantly reduced the shoot fresh <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> weight, number of nodules, dry weight of nodules {{and percentage of}} mycorrhizal infection. Both VAM inoculation and phosphorus fertilization significantly increased the shoot and root fresh <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> weights, number of nodules <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> weight of nodules under normal and saline conditions. High levels of superphosphate (150 kg/ha) completely suppressed the enhancing effect of the VAM under normal conditions, and the effect was strong at 115 kg/ha under saline conditions.

5|$|Butterflies {{have the}} typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs {{on the food}} plant on which their larvae, known as {{caterpillars}}, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded <b>and</b> <b>dried,</b> it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their whole life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Collybia cookei is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the two other members of Collybia, both of which are outwardly similar in appearance; distinguishing between the three typically requires excavating the stem base away from the moss or debris in which the stem is embedded. In the field, C.tuberosa may be distinguished from C.cookei by its dark brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed. Using a microscope provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the sclerotia of C.cookei are rounded, while those of C.tuberosa are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh <b>and</b> <b>dried</b> material of the two species. C.cirrhata does not produce sclerotia.|$|E
5|$|Constructing {{composite}} bows requires {{much more}} time and {{a greater variety of}} materials than self bows, and the animal glue used can lose strength in humid conditions; the 6th-century Byzantine military manual, the Strategikon, advised the cavalry of the Byzantine army, many of whom were armed with composite bows, to keep their bows in leather cases to keep them dry. Karpowicz suggests that crafting a composite bow may take a week's work, excluding drying time (months) and gathering materials, while a self bow can be made in a day <b>and</b> <b>dried</b> in a week. Peoples living in humid or rainy regions historically have favoured self-bows, while those living in dry or arid regions have favoured composite bows.|$|E

5|$|English tastes evolved {{during the}} sixteenth century {{in at least three}} ways. Firstly, recipes emphasise a balance of sweet and sour. Secondly, butter becomes an {{important}} ingredient in sauces, a trend which continued in later centuries. Thirdly, herbs, which could be grown locally but had been little used in the Middle Ages, started to replace spices as flavourings. In A. W.'s Book of Cookrye, 35% of the recipes for meat stews and sauces include herbs, most commonly thyme. On the other hand, 76% of those meat recipes still used the distinctly mediaeval combination of sugar <b>and</b> <b>dried</b> fruit, together or separately. New ingredients were arriving from distant countries, too: The Good Huswifes Jewell introduced sweet potatoes alongside familiar Medieval recipes.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{tradition}} holds that, {{because of}} the great value of wood, only expert scribes used it, while pupils wrote on banana leaves. German ethnologist Thomas Barthel believed that carving on wood was a secondary development {{in the evolution of}} the script based on an earlier stage of incising banana leaves or the sheaths of the banana trunk with a bone stylus, and that the medium of leaves was retained not only for lessons but to plan and compose the texts of the wooden tablets. He found experimentally that the glyphs were quite visible on banana leaves due to the sap that emerged from the cuts <b>and</b> <b>dried</b> on the surface. However, when the leaves themselves dried they became brittle and would not have survived for long.|$|E

The first step for making gunpowder is to powder and mix together sulphur, saltpetre, charcoal, pitch, <b>and</b> <b>dried</b> lacquer. Tung oil, dried plants, and wax are mixed next to create a paste. The paste and powder are combined and carefully stirred. Then the mixture is placed inside a paper container, wrapped up, and tied using hemp twine. Several precautions are taken to prevent the gunpowder from becoming damp.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{study was}} carried out at Botswana College of Agriculture (BCA) garden to {{evaluate}} the response of Corchorus olitorius grown in four different growing media as follows; clay, sandy, commercial compost and loam soil being the treatments 1 - 4, respectively.

Productivity parameters and yield components measured were as follows; plant height, canopy spread, leaf area, stem diameter, number of leaves, branches and pods, both fresh leaf <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> masses, both fresh plant (stem + branches) <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> masses, both fresh root <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> masses, <b>and</b> both fresh pod <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> masses.
