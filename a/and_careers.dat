This study examined the relation between calling, <b>career</b> adaptability <b>and</b> <b>career</b> competencies among 458 Romanian university students. The mediation role of career adaptability on the relation between calling <b>and</b> <b>career</b> competencies was tested.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to verify whether career search self-efficacy could mediate the relationship between family support <b>and</b> <b>career</b> indecision. Using a sample of 253 Italian youth, the study found that, for male adolescents attending a university-preparation high school, career search selfefficacy partially mediated the relationship between family support <b>and</b> <b>career</b> indecision. Contrary to expectations, for female adolescents there was no direct relationship between family support <b>and</b> <b>career</b> indecision; however, family support was directly associated with <b>career</b> search self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>career</b> search selfefficacy was associated with career indecision...|$|R

40|$|An Australian sample (N = 467) of {{high school}} {{students}} was administered scales tapping optimism, self-esteem, career expectations, career goals, <b>career</b> planning <b>and</b> <b>career</b> exploration. The study tested a career mediational model based on social cognitive <b>career</b> theory (SCCT) <b>and</b> cognitive-motivational-relational theory (CMR). It was hypothesised that the stable person inputs of optimism and self-esteem would predict <b>career</b> planning <b>and</b> <b>career</b> exploration through the variables of <b>career</b> expectations <b>and</b> <b>career</b> goals differentially for young males and females. For males, optimism <b>and</b> self-esteem influenced <b>career</b> expectations, sequentially predicting career goals, <b>career</b> planning <b>and</b> <b>career</b> exploration. A different pathway was identified for females, with optimism directly influencing career goals, which subsequently predicted <b>career</b> planning <b>and</b> <b>career</b> exploration.

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} funerary stelas for {{officials}} of the late Third dynasty, small amounts of biographical detail were added next to the deceased men's titles. However, {{it was not until}} the Sixth dynasty that narratives of the lives <b>and</b> <b>careers</b> of government officials were inscribed. Tomb biographies became more detailed during the Middle Kingdom, and included information about the deceased person's family. The vast majority of autobiographical texts are dedicated to scribal bureaucrats, but during the New Kingdom some were dedicated to military officers and soldiers. Autobiographical texts of the Late Period place a greater stress upon seeking help from deities than acting righteously to succeed in life. Whereas earlier autobiographical texts exclusively dealt with celebrating successful lives, Late Period autobiographical texts include laments for premature death, similar to the epitaphs of ancient Greece.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., the National Organization for Women (NOW) {{began in}} 1966 to seek women's equality, {{including}} through the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), {{which did not}} pass, although some states enacted their own. Reproductive rights in the U.S. centred on the court decision in Roe v. Wade enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable birth control, allowing family planning <b>and</b> <b>careers.</b> The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under Margaret Sanger and elsewhere under Marie Stopes. In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through birth control, which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is three-fold: first, to build an understanding of how high school graduates describe their engagement in college <b>and</b> <b>career</b> ready skills, knowledge, and behaviors during and after high school. The second is to understand how graduates describe secondary school college <b>and</b> <b>career</b> development programs <b>and</b> initiatives. Finally, based on graduate descriptions of struggle after high school, the research uncovered gaps in college <b>and</b> <b>career</b> readiness upon graduation. The conceptual framework for the study was grounded in David Conley’s (2014) Four Keys to College <b>and</b> <b>Career</b> Readiness Model, <b>and</b> social cognitive <b>career</b> theory was explored throughout the study. A qualitative interview study was conducted {{to gain a better understanding}} of how students engage in the acquisition of college <b>and</b> <b>career</b> ready skills, <b>and</b> what college <b>and</b> <b>career</b> ready skills they struggle with upon graduation. Interviews of high school graduates from a southwestern Pennsylvania school district were conducted following Clara Hill’s (1997) Consensual Qualitative Research Method interview process. Analysis of the data included deductive coding using the Four Keys to College <b>and</b> <b>Career</b> Readiness (Conley, 2014), and the social cognitive career theory model of career self-management (Lent & Brown, 2013). Second cycle pattern coding revealed themes of how graduates engaged in college <b>and</b> <b>career</b> readiness, <b>and</b> how their secondary school experiences did or did not contribute to their readiness...|$|R

5|$|Prior {{to moving}} its {{headquarters}} to Chicago, aerospace manufacturer Boeing (#30) {{was the largest}} company based in Seattle. Its largest division is still headquartered in nearby Renton, and the company has large aircraft manufacturing plants in Everett and Renton, so it remains the largest private employer in the Seattle metropolitan area. Former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels announced a desire to spark a new economic boom driven by the biotechnology industry in 2006. Major redevelopment of the South Lake Union neighborhood is underway, {{in an effort to}} attract new and established biotech companies to the city, joining biotech companies Corixa (acquired by GlaxoSmithKline), Immunex (now part of Amgen), Trubion, and ZymoGenetics. Vulcan Inc., the holding company of billionaire Paul Allen, is behind most of the development projects in the region. While some see the new development as an economic boon, others have criticized Nickels and the Seattle City Council for pandering to Allen's interests at taxpayers' expense. Also in 2006, Expansion Magazine ranked Seattle among the top 10 metropolitan areas in the nation for climates favorable to business expansion. In 2005, Forbes ranked Seattle as the most expensive American city for buying a house based on the local income levels. In 2013, however, the magazine ranked Seattle No. 9 on its list of the Best Places for Business <b>and</b> <b>Careers.</b>|$|E

40|$|In today's dynamic <b>and</b> {{uncertain}} <b>career</b> context, values play {{an important}} role for <b>career</b> choice <b>and</b> lifelong <b>career</b> self-management. Values are desirable goals that are sought by individuals to satisfy their needs and are important for understanding career orientations in terms of protean <b>and</b> boundaryless <b>career</b> orientations <b>and</b> <b>career</b> anchors. However, how career orientations or career anchors fit into a well-established and supported model and into the structure of basic human values remains an important and under-investigated question. The aim {{of this study was to}} use Schwartz's model of structural values to empirically explore the relationships and structural correspondences among basic values, <b>career</b> orientations, <b>and</b> <b>career</b> anchors. A heterogeneous sample of 238 employees from French-speaking Switzerland (Mage = 35. 60, SD = 13. 03) completed the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ 5 X), the Protean <b>and</b> Boundaryless <b>Career</b> Attitudes Scales (PCAS, BCAS), <b>and</b> the <b>Career</b> Orientation Inventory (COI) via an anonymous and confidential survey questionnaire. The results showed that it was possible to meaningfully position both <b>career</b> orientations <b>and</b> <b>career</b> anchors in Schwartz's values structure. The protean <b>and</b> boundaryless <b>career</b> orientations were positively related to Schwartz's basic values that emphasized openness to change <b>and</b> <b>career</b> anchors meaningfully followed the motivational continuum of these basic values. Overall, the overlap among the basic values, <b>career</b> orientations, <b>and</b> <b>career</b> anchors appeared relatively important, suggesting that these basic values, orientations, and anchors should be considered simultaneously to understand and address the factors and processes underlying individuals' <b>career</b> choices <b>and</b> paths...|$|R
