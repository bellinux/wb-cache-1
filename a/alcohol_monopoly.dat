According to two Swedish addiction experts, this is “dangerous and misleading” and enough for the beverages {{to be a threat}} to recovering alcoholics. While different from a zero-declaration, Systembolaget has countered that according to EU regulation, alcohol content of less than 1.2% {{does not need to be}} declared.|$|E

50|$|TTL was {{established}} as a government agency during Japanese colonial rule and was renamed the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau (菸酒公賣局) in 1947. Between 1947 and 1968 the Bureau exercised a <b>monopoly</b> over all <b>alcohol,</b> tobacco, and camphor products sold in Taiwan. It retained tobacco and <b>alcohol</b> <b>monopolies</b> until Taiwan's entry into the WTO in 2002.|$|R
50|$|Rúsdrekkasøla Landsins, {{or simply}} Rúsan, is the {{national}} alcoholic beverage retailing monopoly of the Faroe Islands, following the model of neighbouring Nordic <b>alcohol</b> <b>monopolies</b> Vinmonopolet, Systembolaget, Vínbúð and Alko. The company was founded in 1992 after {{a long period of}} rationing and shipping such goods from Denmark. The company has outlets in Tórshavn, Hoyvík, Klaksvík, Saltangará, Miðvágur, Sandur and Trongisvágur.|$|R

50|$|Following {{the end of}} prohibition, {{government}} <b>alcohol</b> <b>monopolies</b> {{were established}} with detailed restrictions and high taxes. Some of these restrictions have since been lifted. For example, supermarkets in Finland are allowed to sell only fermented beverages with an alcohol content up to 4.7% ABV, but Alko, the government monopoly, is allowed to sell wine and spirits. This {{is also the case}} with the Norwegian Vinmonopolet and the Swedish Systembolaget (though in Sweden the limit for allowed ABV in supermarkets is 3.5%).|$|R

50|$|Stepan Bandera became {{head of the}} OUN {{national}} {{executive in}} Galicia in June 1933. He expanded the OUN's network in the Kresy, directing it against both Poland and the Soviet Union. To stop expropriations, Bandera turned OUN against the Polish officials who were directly responsible for anti-Ukrainian policies. Activities included mass campaigns against Polish tobacco and <b>alcohol</b> <b>monopolies</b> and against the denationalization of Ukrainian youth. He was arrested in Lviv in 1934, and tried twice: first, concerning involvement in a plot to assassinate the minister of internal affairs, Bronisław Pieracki, and second at a general trial of OUN executives. He was convicted of terrorism and sentenced to death.|$|R
50|$|The {{governments of}} these {{countries}} claim {{that the purpose of}} these monopolies is to reduce the consumption of <b>alcohol.</b> These <b>monopolies</b> have had success in the past, but since joining the European Union it has been difficult to curb the importation of liquor, legal or illegal, from other EU countries. That has made the monopolies less effective in reducing excessive drinking.|$|R
50|$|The {{sale and}} {{consumption}} of liquor, wine, and beer are still controlled to ensure that strict community standards and revenue generation from the <b>alcohol</b> retail <b>monopoly</b> are upheld. In April 2007, Ontario Minister of Provincial Parliament Kim Craitor suggested that local brewers {{should be able to}} sell their beer in local corner stores, however, the motion was quickly rejected by Premier Dalton McGuinty.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, the {{government}} still controls {{the sale and}} consumption of liquor, wine, and beer to ensure compliance with strict community standards and to generate revenue from the <b>alcohol</b> retail <b>monopoly.</b> In April 2007, Ontario Minister of Provincial Parliament Kim Craitor suggested that local brewers {{should be able to}} sell their beer in local corner stores; however, the motion was quickly rejected by Premier Dalton McGuinty.|$|R
50|$|Until 1998, {{the hard}} alcohol and wine bottles sold at Systembolaget — the {{government}} owned <b>alcohol</b> retail <b>monopoly</b> — had a deposit as well, {{but due to}} the deregulation of the Systembolaget's suppliers, the former sole supplier V&S Group dropped the deposit on their bottles due to the restricted bottle shapes giving V&S a disadvantage compared to the competitors. The bottles could be returned and deposit refunded until early 1999 at Systembolaget.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the repeal}} of {{national}} Prohibition in the United States in 1933, some states chose to maintain prohibition within their own borders. Others chose to permit local option on the controversial issue. In the remainder of states, there was no prohibition. Overlying the patchwork of prohibition, many states (known as alcoholic beverage control states) decided to establish their own monopolies over the wholesaling and/or retailing of alcoholic beverages. Montgomery County, Maryland, for example, has used local option to establish its <b>alcohol</b> control <b>monopoly</b> within its borders.|$|R

50|$|An <b>alcohol</b> <b>monopoly</b> is a {{government}} monopoly on manufacturing and/or retailing of some or all alcoholic beverages, such as beer, wine and spirits. It {{can be used as}} an alternative for total prohibition. They exist in all Nordic countries except mainland Denmark (only on the Faroe Islands), and in all provinces and territories in Canada except Alberta (which privatized its monopoly in 1993). In the United States, there are some alcoholic beverage control states, where alcohol sales are controlled by either private retailers, or, like in Pennsylvania, {{a government}} operation. An <b>alcohol</b> <b>monopoly</b> also formerly existed in the Republic of China (Taiwan) between 1947 and 2002, when the Taiwan market was opened to overseas brands as part of its admission to the WTO in 2002.|$|E
50|$|Nowadays, {{usage of}} the term often refers to its 19th-century meaning: under the Russian state <b>alcohol</b> <b>monopoly,</b> vodka sellers in taverns were {{commonly}} called tselovalniks because they gave a cross-kissing oath not to dilute vodka supplied from state-controlled distilleries and to sell it according to the demand.|$|E
50|$|As the Norwegian alcohol {{taxes are}} higher than the Swedish ones, Norwegian shoppers have caused the Swedish <b>alcohol</b> {{retailing}} <b>monopoly</b> Systembolaget to open an extra store to cater for demand.When only one shop existed, the Systembolaget shop had the highest sales in Sweden, causing traffic congestion near the shop in the inner city. The Norwegians have been notoriously known for causing havoc on Maundy Thursday as this is a public holiday in Norway but not in Sweden. For Easter 2008 the city council decided to keep Systembolaget closed on Maundy Thursday.|$|R
50|$|Until 1994, {{the group}} had the {{position}} of a national monopoly for production and distribution, but this was abolished when Sweden joined the European Union in 1995. However, the Swedish <b>alcohol</b> retailing <b>monopoly,</b> operated by Systembolaget, is still in force. On March 31, 2008 it was announced that the Swedish government intended to sell V & S Group to Pernod Ricard for 5.626 billion euro, corresponding to 55 billion Swedish kronor. The deal was approved and finalized on July 24, 2008 at an estimated value of 5.69 billion euro.|$|R
40|$|G. Amkell-­‐ Landrén and W. Fri – Master Thesis Project 2015 2 Abstract Intermediaries {{are crucial}} in the {{international}} wine industry and previous studies have pointed out the lack of research regarding these types of intermediaries. This study aims to provide {{a deeper understanding of}} the matchmaking process between Spanish wine producers and buyers in the Swedish market, namely the hotel, restaurant and café (Ho. Re. Ca) segment and the <b>alcohol</b> retail <b>monopoly</b> Systembolaget. The investigation is based on a pilot study, seven interviews with intermediating wine agents and two interviews with Spanish wine producers. On the buyer side, one interview with a representative of the Ho. Re. Ca segment as well as an interview with the Swedish <b>alcohol</b> retail <b>monopoly</b> Systembolaget has been conducted. Based on existing research we have found that trust and commitment in business relationship are crucial for intermediaries in the wine industry together with reducing the uncertainty in the matchmaking process. The main outcomes of this study are, firstly, that the intermediating wine agents must take a proactive approach towards buyers and suppliers. Secondly, that the business relationships are largely impacted by laws and regulations in the highly complex international wine market. Lastly, the expertise of the intermediating wine agent is an important differentiator for successful intermediation in the wine industry alongside with the track record of the intermediating wine agent...|$|R
