25|$|A {{piezoelectric}} transformer {{is a type}} of AC voltage multiplier. Unlike {{a conventional}} transformer, which uses magnetic coupling between input and output, the piezoelectric transformer uses acoustic coupling. An input voltage is applied across a short length of a bar of piezoceramic material such as PZT, creating an <b>alternating</b> <b>stress</b> in the bar by the inverse piezoelectric effect and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The vibration frequency is chosen to be the resonant frequency of the block, typically in the 100kilohertz to 1megahertz range. A higher output voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the piezoelectric effect. Step-up ratios of more than 1,000:1 have been demonstrated. An extra feature of this transformer is that, by operating it above its resonant frequency, it can be made to appear as an inductive load, which is useful in circuits that require a controlled soft start. These devices can be used in DC–AC inverters to drive cold cathode fluorescent lamps. Piezo transformers {{are some of the most}} compact high voltage sources.|$|E

Fatigue failure is typically modeled by decomposing cyclic stresses into mean and alternating components. Mean stress is the time average of the principal stress. The definition of <b>alternating</b> <b>stress</b> varies between different sources. It is either defined as {{the difference between the}} minimum and the maximum stress, or the difference between the mean and maximum stress.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} to study the fatigue behavior of a SAE 1045 steel both uncoated and coated with a Colmonoy 88 alloy (NiCrBSiW) of approximately 410 μm thick, deposited by HVOF thermal spraying. Previously to deposition the samples were grit-blasted with alumina particles of approximately 1 mm in equivalent diameter. Tensile and fatigue tests were carried out with the uncoated and coated specimens. Fatigue tests were conducted under rotating bending conditions (R = − 1) at a frequency of 50 Hz. The samples tested were in three different surface conditions, including polished, grit-blasted and coated. The fatigue limit was determined {{by means of the}} staircase method employing a stress step of 5 MPa. The results indicate that the presence of the coating gives rise to a reduction in the fatigue life of the coated samples tested in air in comparison with the uncoated specimens. On the contrary, when the coated samples were tested in a NaCl solution at <b>alternating</b> <b>stresses</b> less than 350 MPa, these showed an increase in fatigue life in comparison with the polished uncoated samples. The analysis of the fracture surfaces of the specimens tested in air revealed that alumina particles present {{on the surface of the}} grit-blasted samples acted as stress concentrators, inducing the nucleation of fatigue cracks at the substrate–coating interface, which explains the reduction in fatigue life. However, under corrosive conditions and low <b>alternating</b> <b>stresses,</b> the presence of the coating provides an effective protection against corrosion-fatigue failures, giving rise to an improvement of the corrosion-fatigue performance of the coated system. On the contrary, at elevated <b>alternating</b> <b>stresses,</b> the coating was observed to delaminate from the substrate, leading to an impairment of the corrosion-fatigue behavior of the coated samples...|$|R
50|$|Corrosion fatigue is fatigue in a {{corrosive}} environment. It is {{the mechanical}} degradation of a material under the joint action of corrosion and cyclic loading. Nearly all engineering structures experience {{some form of}} <b>alternating</b> <b>stress,</b> and are exposed to harmful environments during their service life. The environment {{plays a significant role}} in the fatigue of high-strength structural materials like steel, aluminum alloys and titanium alloys. Materials with high specific strength are being developed to meet the requirements of advancing technology. However,their usefulness depends to a large extent on the degree to which they resist corrosion fatigue. The effects of corrosive environments on the fatigue behavior of metals were studied as early as 1930. The phenomenon should not be confused with stress corrosion cracking, where corrosion (such as pitting) leads to the development of brittle cracks, growth and failure. The only requirement for corrosion fatigue is that the sample be under tensile stress.|$|E

40|$|Fatigue life {{estimation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important design considerations in mechanical parts which are subjected to alternating loads. When loads act along several axes, multiaxial fatigue approach should be used to obtain more accurate results than uniaxial fatigue method. In this paper stress analysis of the steel shaft of a high speed microgenerator rotor with 47750 rpm and 100 kW is carried out using analytical stress formulation. Mean and alternative components of stresses have been distinguished. Because <b>alternating</b> <b>stresses</b> act on shaft, fatigue may occur and regarding to existence of alternating torsional and bending stresses in the same time, multiaxial fatigue analysis is essential. Also the range of <b>alternating</b> <b>stresses</b> is small compared to fatigue endurance limit. So the multiaxial fatigue criteria based on stress have been chosen. Then multiaxial fatigue damage and critical plane orientations of Findley and McDiarmid criteria have been identified using an analytical formulation in a MATLAB code. Finally, fatigue life of each critical point of shaft has been calculated using maximum damage in respective critical plane. In this way, effect of frequency difference between torsional and bending stresses has been considered...|$|R
40|$|This work investigates a {{simplified}} approach {{to cope with}} the optimization of preliminary design of structures under local fatigue constraints along with a global enforcement on the overall compliance. The problem aims at the minimization of the weight of linear elastic structures under given loads and boundary conditions. The expected stiffness of the optimal structure is provided by the global constraint, whereas a set of local stress–based constraints ask for a structure to be fatigue resistant. A modified Goodman fatigue strength comparison is implemented through the same formalism to address pressure–dependent failure in materials as in Drucker–Prager strength criterion. As a simplification, the Sines approach is used to define the equivalent mean and <b>alternating</b> <b>stresses</b> to address the fatigue resistance for an infinite life time. Sines computation is based on the equivalent mean and <b>alternate</b> <b>stress</b> depending on the invariants of the stress tensor and its deviatoric part, respectively.

For increasing static applied tensile or compressive stress, weight loss and its rate do not vary in a monotonic fashion but first decrease, then increase through a peak, and then decrease again. Tensile stress except for given stress regimes, and compressive stress at all stress levels, decreases erosion damage compared with zero-stress values. Under <b>alternating</b> <b>stress,</b> the weight loss rate varies with trends similar to those under static applied stress. However, the weight loss rate is larger than for the same static stress, so that the erosion damage is more affected by <b>alternating</b> <b>stress</b> than by static stress.

It uses a newly developed frequency and distance dependent correlation model that has features to model the decay phenomena along the flow and across the flow with the capability to introduce a phase delay. The analytical results are compared using two computer codes SAFER (Spectral Analysis of Finite Element Responses) and NESSUS (Numerical Evaluation of Stochastic Structures Under Stress) and with experimentally observed strain gage data. The computer code NESSUS with an interface to a sub set of Composite Load Spectra (CLS) code {{is used for the}} probabilistic analysis. A Fatigue code was used to calculate fatigue damage due to the random pressure excitation. The random variables modeled include engine system primitive variables that influence the operating conditions, convection velocity coefficient, stress concentration factor, structural damping, and thickness of the inner and outer vanes. The need for an appropriate correlation model in addition to magnitude of the PSD is emphasized. The study demonstrates that correlation characteristics even under random pressure loads are capable of causing resonance like effects for some modes.
