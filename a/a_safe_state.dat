5|$|The Greenbackers saw {{the impact}} of Civil War loyalties more acutely as they vied for Southern votes. Weaver {{embarked}} on a speaking tour of the South in July and August. Although the local Greenback parties had seen some recent success, the national party, with an ex-Republican Union general {{at the head of}} the ticket, faced more opposition. The party's courtship of black voters, too, threatened the white Democratic establishment, leading to violent outbursts at Weaver's rallies and threats against his supporters. As Weaver campaigned in the North in September and October, Republicans accused him of purposely dividing the vote to help Democrats win a plurality in marginal states. Although Weaver refused to cooperate with Democrats in running fusion slates of presidential electors, in state-level races, Greenback candidates did often combine with Democrats to defeat Republican candidates. In the September gubernatorial race in Maine, one such fusion ticket nominated Harris M. Plaisted, who narrowly defeated the incumbent Republican in what was thought to be <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>state</b> for that party. The surprise defeat sent a shock through the Garfield campaign, and caused them to rethink their strategy of waving the bloody shirt.|$|E

Prior to the election, all 17 news {{organizations}} considered this a state McCain would win, or otherwise considered as <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> red <b>state.</b> Although {{the state has}} the largest African American percentage in the country, Mississippi remains <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> red <b>state</b> at the presidential level, having voted Republican every election year since 1980.

Prior to the election, all 17 news {{organizations}} considered this a state McCain would win, or otherwise considered as <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> red <b>state.</b> Polling {{in the state}} gave a hefty and large lead to Republican John McCain over Democrat Barack Obama. Because of Wyoming's status as <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> red <b>state,</b> none of the major party candidates campaigned in the state. Despite McCain's landslide victory, Obama did do significantly better than John Kerry in 2004 and even won one more county than Kerry.|$|R

25|$|A third wire, {{called the}} bond (or earth) wire, is often {{connected}} between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground. This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures {{there is always}} a low electrical impedance path to ground sufficient to carry any fault current {{for as long as it}} takes for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the overcurrent protection device (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>state.</b> All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel, as is the neutral/identified conductor if present.|$|E

50|$|The Banker's Algorithm derives {{its name}} from the fact that this {{algorithm}} could be used in a banking system to ensure that the bank does not run out of resources, because the bank would never allocate its money {{in such a way that}} it can no longer satisfy the needs of all its customers. By using the Banker's algorithm, the bank ensures that when customers request money the bank never leaves <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>state.</b> If the customer's request does not cause the bank to leave <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>state,</b> the cash will be allocated, otherwise the customer must wait until some other customer deposits enough.|$|E
