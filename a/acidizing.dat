30|$|As {{presented}} in Tables  8 and 9 which highlight {{the state of}} the cores before and after core flooding tests, the core <b>acidized</b> with Jatropha curcas oil-based emulsified acid had a more drastic effect on permeability, having a permeability ratio (final K/initial K) of 227.2 than the core <b>acidized</b> with diesel-based emulsion having a permeability ratio of 155.3 (Sayed et al. 2012). This is presumed to be because of higher viscosity provided by Jatropha oil due to which the retardation effect is much more effective for generating larger number of permeable zones by branching out from the original fluid conduit path rather than just catering to one permeable zone (Markey et al. 2014). In contrast diesel oil due to lower viscosity has more dissolution reaction between the surface of the rock and emulsified acid, it does not cater to lower permeable zones (Tables  10, 11, 12).|$|R

The plots clarified the existence of rock heterogeneities and revealed how the processes of dissolution function in chalk rock. Experimental data showed clearly that the effect of dissolution depends on the type of rock and the fluid system; dolomite, for example, dissolves more rapidly but more roughly than limestone.

50|$|Permeability is the {{property}} of rocks that {{is an indication of}} the ability for fluids (gas or liquid) to flow through rocks. High permeability will allow fluids to move rapidly through rocks. Permeability is affected by the pressure in a rock. The unit of measure is called the darcy, named after Henry Darcy (1803-1858). Sandstones may vary in permeability from less than one to over 50,000 millidarcys (md). Permeabilities are more commonly in the range of tens to hundreds of millidarcies. A rock with 25% porosity and a permeability of 1 md will not yield a significant flow of water. Such “tight” rocks are usually artificially stimulated (fractured or <b>acidized)</b> to create permeability and yield a flow.|$|R

30|$|To {{maintain}} anoxic conditions, {{all experiments}} were performed in an Ar (5 % H 2)-purged glovebox.

30|$|Based on {{the above}} findings, {{researchers}} {{began to focus}} on the only variable that can be manipulated in a reservoir—the injection brine salinity. Researchers noticed that improved recovery by injection of low-salinity brine only occurred when crude oil and clay bearing sandstone mineralogy were present. Based on this observation, Tang and Morrow (1999 a, b) offered the first theoretical interpretation of the mechanism responsible for the recovery improvement. They observed an increase in water flood and spontaneous imbibition recovery with a decrease in salinity in numerous cases. The authors used Berea cores, CS crude, and refined oil and 7 different brines ranging from 35, 960  ppm TDS down to 151.5  ppm TDS. Oil Recovery improved significantly in the CS reservoir and Berea cores when low-salinity brine was injected instead of high salinity, but recovery improved only marginally in the more clay-free cores. Berea cores that were fired and <b>acidized,</b> to stabilize fines, were insensitive to brine salinity. Tang and Morrow (1999 a, b) concluded that heavy polar components in the crude oil adsorb onto fine particles along the pore walls and that these mixed-wet fines are stripped by low-salinity brine, altering wettability and increase oil recovery.|$|R

30|$|Sandstone {{formations}} {{are challenging}} to <b>acidize</b> {{because of the}} presence of alumino-silicates such as clays, zeolites, and feldspars, which may lead to unwanted precipitates in contact with mud acids as a result of secondary and tertiary reaction products. For instance, smectite and mixed layer clays are unstable in HCl at temperatures of approximately 150  °F. Chlorite is unstable in presence of HCl at temperatures above 125  °F. When contacted with HCl, the clay structure may disintegrate, releasing iron which may precipitate in presence of HCl acid (Rae and Di Lullo 2003). Therefore, formations with high levels of chlorite respond best to acid formulations based on acetic acid rather than hydrochloric acid, since the former limits iron liberation and thereby reduces the risk of precipitates from iron reaction products (Nasr-El-Din and Al-Humaidan 2001; Hashem et al. 1999). In formations with high levels of feldspar (> 20  %), a common practice is to limit the strength of HF acid stages to reduce the formation of complex fluorosilicate precipitates and other species that would result from excessive dissolution of the mineral by stronger acid (Coulter and Jennings 1997).|$|R

Methods The enzymolysis of sample within Tris/HCl buffer under stable temperature was <b>acidized</b> by hydrochloric acid and extracted by ethyl acetate. The layer of ethyl acetate was evaporated to be nearly dry under a gentle stream of nitrogen. The residue was dissolved with methanol-water (1 : 4, v/v), and separated and purified by PAX cartridge.
