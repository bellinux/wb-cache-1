40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient algorithm {{for using the}} two-axis <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> in portable devices. The general <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module consists of <b>a</b> three-axis <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> and <b>a</b> two-axis inclinometer to calculate tilt-compensated azimuth information. In this paper, the tilt error is compensated using just <b>a</b> two-axis <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> and two-axis accelerometer. The third-axis data of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> is estimated using coordinate information that includes the extended dip angle and tilt information. The extended dip angle is estimated during the normalization process. This algorithm {{can be used to}} provide the tilt-compensated heading information to small portable devices such as navigation systems, PDAs, cell phones, and so on...|$|R

25|$|A Hungarian team {{proposed}} that a sun compass artifact with crystals might have allowed Vikings {{to guide their}} boats at night too. A type of crystal they called a sunstone can use scattered sun light from below the horizon as a guide. What they suggest is that calcite stone crystals similar to one found amongst navigational tools on a sixteenth century sunken ship was used in combination with Haidinger's brush. If so, the Vikings could have used them in the northern latitudes where during the summer it never goes completely dark. In areas of confused magnetic deviation (such as the Labrador coast) a sunstone {{would have been a}} more reliable guide than <b>a</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass.</b>|$|E
25|$|At McCook Field in 1923, Hegenberger (who {{had also}} become a Robins protégé) worked closely with {{engineer}} Bradley Jones, a leading authority on air navigation, to test and adapt for military purposes an earth inductor compass developed by the Pioneer Instrument Company {{in conjunction with the}} National Bureau of Standards. Hegenberger designed an instrument panel incorporating the earth inductor compass, a driftmeter, and <b>a</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> for a navigation station at which sextant readings could also be taken; and a cockpit panel with a dial connected to the navigation station that indicated to the pilot if he was steering to the right or left of the course set by the inductor compass. On September 6, 1923, Hegenberger and Jones successfully tested the equipment by navigating from Dayton to Boston, Massachusetts in a DH-4, above unbroken clouds that completely prevented them from seeing any landmarks on the ground.|$|E
25|$|True north, concept of: The Song Dynasty (9601279) {{official}} Shen Kuo (10311095), {{alongside his}} colleague Wei Pu, improved the orifice {{width of the}} sighting tube to make nightly accurate records of the paths of the moon, stars, and planets in the night sky, for a continuum of five years. By doing so, Shen fixed the outdated position of the pole star, which had shifted over the centuries since the time Zu Geng (fl. 5th century) had plotted it; {{this was due to}} the precession of the Earth's rotational axis. When making the first known experiments with <b>a</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass,</b> Shen Kuo wrote that the needle always pointed slightly east rather than due south, an angle he measured which is now known as magnetic declination, and wrote that the compass needle in fact pointed towards the magnetic north pole instead of true north (indicated by the current pole star); this was a critical step in the history of accurate navigation with a compass.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>{{magnetic}}</b> <b>compass</b> {{points to}} magnetic north pole, which is approximately 1,000 {{miles from the}} true geographic North Pole. A magnetic compass's user can determine true North by finding the magnetic north and then correcting for variation and deviation. Variation {{is defined as the}} angle between the direction of true (geographic) north and the direction of the meridian between the magnetic poles. Variation values for most of the oceans had been calculated and published by 1914. Deviation refers to the response of the compass to local magnetic fields caused by the presence of iron and electric currents; one can partly compensate for these by careful location of the compass and the placement of compensating magnets under the compass itself. Mariners have long known that these measures do not completely cancel deviation; hence, they performed an additional step by measuring the compass bearing of a landmark with a known magnetic bearing. They then pointed their ship to the next compass point and measured again, graphing their results. In this way, correction tables could be created, which would be consulted when compasses were used when traveling in those locations.|$|E

That water could be decomposed by the current from a voltaic pile was discovered by Nicholson and Carlisle in 1800, a process now known as electrolysis. Their work was greatly expanded upon by Michael Faraday in 1833. Current through a resistance causes localised heating, an effect James Prescott Joule studied mathematically in 1840. One {{of the most important}} discoveries relating to current was made accidentally by Hans Christian Ørsted in 1820, when, while preparing a lecture, he witnessed the current in a wire disturbing the needle of <b>a</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass.</b> He had discovered electromagnetism, a fundamental interaction between electricity and magnetics.

Although assisted as planned by the Signal Corps beacon on Maui, the directional radio receiver in the C-2 operated only intermittently before cutting out altogether. The earth inductor compass on the C-2 failed just after takeoff, and despite increasingly cloudier weather, Hegenberger navigated most of the charted Great Circle route by dead reckoning, using <b>a</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> and driftmeter supplemented by celestial navigation observations.

2500|$|The Arab Empire {{significantly}} {{contributed to}} navigation, and had trade networks {{extending from the}} Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea {{in the west to}} the Indian Ocean and China Sea in the east, Apart from the Nile, Tigris and Euphrates, navigable rivers in the Islamic regions were uncommon, so transport by sea was very important. Islamic geography and navigational sciences made use of <b>a</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> and a rudimentary instrument known as a kamal, used for celestial navigation and for measuring the altitudes and latitudes of the stars. The kamal itself was simple to construct. [...] It was a rectangular piece of either bone or wood which had a string with 9 consecutive knots attached to it. [...] Another instrument available, developed by the Arabs as well, was the quadrant. Also a celestial navigation device, it was originally developed for astronomy and later transitioned to navigation. [...] When combined with detailed maps of the period, sailors were able to sail across oceans rather than skirt along the coast. Muslim sailors were also responsible for introducing the lateen sails and large three-masted merchant vessels to the Mediterranean. The origins of the caravel ship, developed and used for long-distance travel by the Portuguese, and later by the rest of Iberians, since the 15th century, also date back to the qarib used by Andalusian explorers by the 13th century.|$|E

This change from a bilateral to <b>a</b> lateralized <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> appears to be a maturation process, the first such case known so far in birds.
