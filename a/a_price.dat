30|$|First, TOU is {{the most}} {{preferable}} pricing rule for consumers. Our estimation results show that TOU has the highest value of WTP of all pricing rules. Second, the characteristics of each consumer affect the choice of <b>a</b> <b>pricing</b> rule. Borenstein (2006) notes {{that the risk of}} <b>a</b> <b>pricing</b> change is one of the important factors in choosing <b>a</b> <b>pricing</b> rule. In fact, we find that consumers who have a preference for risk aversion tend not to choose the RTP. In addition, our results show several characteristics influence the choice of <b>a</b> <b>pricing</b> rule. Our estimation results show that household characteristics are important factors in the choice of <b>a</b> dynamic <b>pricing</b> rule (economic incentive schemes and DLC). Regarding personal characteristic, a strong academic record increases the choice probability of economic incentive rules. Borenstein (2013) notes that lower-income consumers tend to prefer dynamic pricing rule, but our results do not show a robust relationship between income and the choice probability of dynamic pricing schemes. Therefore, the relationship between the choice of each pricing rule and income level could be more complex.|$|R

40|$|This paper studies <b>a</b> {{state-dependent}} <b>pricing</b> {{model in}} which firms face a fixed cost of changing their <b>pricing</b> plans. <b>A</b> <b>pricing</b> plan specifies <b>an</b> entire sequence of time-varying future prices.

Our proposed solution considers multipacket reception capabilities for the physical layer. The network enforces fairness among different users by employing <b>a</b> <b>pricing</b> policy that favors equal access probabilities. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} <b>a</b> clearance <b>pricing</b> on daily perishable products considering <b>a</b> reference <b>price</b> of consumers. The daily perishable {{products are}} sometimes sold at <b>a</b> discount <b>price</b> before closing time to stimulate demand {{when the number}} of unsold products is more than initially envisioned. The discount pricing results both in an increase of the revenue of the day and in a decrease of the disposal cost. The discounting, however, also declines <b>a</b> reference <b>price</b> of consumers which is <b>a</b> mental <b>price</b> and serves as <b>an</b> anchor <b>price</b> to judge if <b>a</b> current sales <b>price</b> is loss or gain for the consumers. An excess discounting decreases the demand for the products sold at <b>a</b> regular <b>price</b> in the future and di-minishes long-term profit. This study conducts a mathematical analysis on the clearance <b>pricing</b> problem for <b>a</b> single period with stochastic variations both on demand and on the inventory level at clearance time. The expected profit function especially de-pends on the response of consumers to the clearing price against their reference <b>prices.</b> <b>A</b> procedure is proposed to derive <b>an</b> optimal clearance <b>price</b> when consumers are loss-neutral. A sufficient condition is shown to obtain <b>an</b> opti-mal <b>price</b> for loss-averse and loss-seeking consumers by an analogous procedure...|$|R
