5|$|These {{moves are}} {{designed}} to be used in flurry combinations. For instance, the player can Seismic Slam an opponent, which pulls in enemies, and progress into a Rising Uppercut, which tosses the opponent into the air. During that toss, the player can charge the Rocket Punch and release as the opponent returns to the ground. Alternatively, the player can launch into the <b>air,</b> <b>pick</b> an opponent to slam, and punch them at close range. The character is built for aggressive playstyles and advanced players.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the airport}} {{has always been}} a {{turbo-prop}} aircraft airport, Pan Am announced, in 2002, intentions to install jet flights between Mayagüez and Las Américas International Airport in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, with Boeing 727s.

50|$|Two {{versions}} of the algorithm exist: a deterministic version that enumerates all permutations until it hits a sorted one, and a randomized version that randomly permutes its input. An analogy for the working of the latter version is to sort {{a deck of cards}} by throwing the deck into the <b>air,</b> <b>picking</b> the cards up at random, and repeating the process until the deck is sorted. Its name comes from the word bogus.|$|R

60|$|Margaret and {{her mother}} were seated in the parlour when Archibald arrived. Mrs Milsom, who had {{elicited}} the fact that Archibald had not kept his appointment, had been saying 'I told you so' for some time, and this had not improved Margaret's temper. When, therefore, Archibald, damp and dishevelled, was shown in, the chill in the air nearly gave him frost-bite. Mrs Milsom did her celebrated imitation of the Gorgon, while Margaret, lightly humming an <b>air,</b> <b>picked</b> up a weekly paper and became absorbed in it.|$|R
50|$|The Adventure Girls in the <b>Air</b> <b>picks</b> up {{with the}} six girls in their senior year at Marchton High School. The book {{involves}} two distinct narrative arcs. The first nine chapters involve the attempt by Brent Stockton, a pilot and inventor, to perfect a new airplane motor, and the attempts by enemies to steal his designs. Chapters ten through sixteen detail a plane crash resulting in Gale's disappearance, amnesia, and rediscovery. The book then concludes with five chapters narrating {{the end of the}} school year and preparations for college.|$|R

40|$|During {{automotive}} painting, {{volatile organic}} compounds (VOCs) associated with the paint solvents are emitted to the atmosphere. Most VOC emissions come from spraying operations via the use of solvent-based paints, as the spraybooth <b>air</b> <b>picks</b> up gaseous solvent compounds and overspray paint materials. The VOCs consist of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, alcohols, and glycolethers. Most VOCs (some hydrophilic VOCs are captured and retained in the water.) are captured by an adsorption system and thermally oxidized. In this paper, the processes involved in automotive painting and in VOC control are reviewed. The topics include: painting operations (briefly), the nature of VOCs, VOC-control processes (adsorption, absorption, biological removal, and thermal oxidation) and energy recovery from VOCs using a fuel reformer and a fuel cell, and the beneficial use of paint sludge...|$|R

50|$|In early 1991, Continental {{increased}} {{flights and}} destinations at LaGuardia airport after the shutdown of Eastern Airlines, and also {{increased the number}} of Continental Express flights and destinations at the airport. But {{after the end of the}} summer season in 1991, Continental decided to close the former PBA hubs at Boston and LaGuardia. Because some of the routes were operated under the federal Essential Air Service program, replacement service had to be obtained before the government would allow Continental to abandon some of the routes, most notably service to Martha's Vineyard, Bar Harbor ME, and Rockland, ME. An agreement was reached where Cape Air would operate year round service between Boston and Martha's Vineyard, and Continental Express would continue to operate seasonal service from Newark to Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and Hyannis. Colgan <b>Air</b> <b>picked</b> up the routes from Boston to Maine. This then permitted Continental to completely close the Continental Express hubs at Boston and LaGuardia, as well as the PBA maintenance hangar and regional offices in Hyannis.|$|R

50|$|The BBC <b>aired</b> <b>Pick</b> of the Pops on its Light Programme {{radio station}} on 4 October 1955. Initially airing popular songs, it {{developed}} an aggregated chart in March 1958. Using the NME, Melody Maker, Disc and Record Mirror charts, the BBC averaged them by totalling points gained {{on the four}} charts (one point for a number one, two for a number two, etc.) to give a chart average; however, this method was prone to tied positions. Record Retailer {{was included in the}} average on 31 March 1962, after Record Mirror ceased compiling its chart. David Jacobs and Alan Freeman both had stints presenting the Pick of the Pops chart. Freeman took Pick of the Pops to its regular Sunday afternoon slot in early 1962. Freeman (along with Pete Murray, David Jacobs and Jimmy Savile) was one of the four original presenters on Top of the Pops, which first aired 1 January 1964 on BBC One (then known as BBC TV). Top of the Pops, like Pick of the Pops, used a combination of predominant periodicals until the formation of the BMRB chart in 1969.|$|R

50|$|In a {{phenomenon}} called sympathetic vibration, a string seems to vibrate by itself. This happens when sound waves strike the string at a frequency {{close to the}} string's fundamental pitch or one of its overtones. The string is connected to this similar sound wave through the <b>air,</b> which <b>picks</b> up the vibrations of the sound waves at the same frequency, and in turn causes the string to vibrate on its own. When an outside source applies forced vibration that matches a string's natural frequency, the string vibrates.|$|R
50|$|The 1994 {{military}} {{reductions in}} Europe resulted in Morón <b>Air</b> Base <b>picking</b> up a regional responsibility for providing support to designated USAF units in Spain, Italy, and Greece with the draw-down of USAFE units at Torrejon AB, Spain, San Vito AS, Italy and Iraklion AS, Greece. Along {{with the increased}} responsibility came a new unit designation. The 712th Air Base Flight became the 496th Air Base Squadron on 1 July 1994, under the newly formed 616th Regional Support Group located at Aviano Air Base, Italy.|$|R

25|$|On the 16th, warm <b>air</b> <b>picking</b> up {{moisture}} – due to {{residual heat}} from the Atlantic Ocean – travelled towards the South West Cornish coast as prevailing winds. Upon contact with the topographically vertical coast, these winds experienced a strong up-drafting force thus causing internal moisture to reach the atmosphere, and consequently cool as a string of storm clouds. With convergence and coalescence, enhanced moisture levels resulted in heavy rainfall {{on the afternoon of}} 16 August 2004. 185mm (7inches) of rain fell over the high ground just inland of Boscastle. At the peak of the downpour, at about 15:40 GMT, 24.1mm of rain (almost one inch) was recorded as falling in just 15 minutes at Lesnewth, 2.5 miles (4km) up the valley from Boscastle. In Boscastle, 89mm (3.5inches) of rain was recorded in 60 minutes. The rain was very localised: Otterham and Lesnewth, both a few miles inland from Boscastle, recorded 24 hour totals of 200mm and 185mm respectively on the day, whereas four of the nearest 10 rain gauges showed less than 3mm of rain in the same period. The cause of the very heavy localised rain is thought to be an extreme example of what has become known as the Brown Willy effect.|$|R
