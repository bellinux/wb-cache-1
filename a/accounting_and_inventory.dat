40|$|The jewelry {{manufacturing}} industry {{is an example}} of an industry that is slow to accept and incorporate new technology. There are, however, some large companies that have automated the <b>accounting</b> <b>and</b> <b>inventory</b> functions. Some of these companies have even invested in systems that can do image storage and retrieval. Until recently, these computer systems have been very expensive to purchase. Prestige Marketing, Ltd. is a small jewelry manufacturing company. The owner of Prestige recognized the advantage of utilizing inexpensive personal computers to develop a software system that would calculate the cost of manufacturing and determine the recommended selling price of a jewelry item. Simultaneously, this system would maintain a catalog of all items manufactured with a high resolution digitized color image of each item. The author, owner of Biconix Systems, Inc., was requested by the owner of Prestige Marketing to develop this system which was called the Jeweler 2 ̆ 7 s Showcase. The literature review has shown that there are no existing systems that satisfy all the requirements of the Jeweler 2 ̆ 7 s Showcase as defined by the owner of Prestige. The review did show, however, that there is a trend for the larger companies to invest in imaging systems. An analysis of a business idea to market the Jeweler 2 ̆ 7 s Showcase suggested that this new software system would be marketable. Requirements and design specifications were developed by the author and approved by the owner of Prestige Marketing. DOS and Windows were selected as the operating system and environment.

40|$|OVERVIEW The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is {{the highest}} ranking {{official}} in the company who has the responsibility of formulating and executing strategy. The CEO is ultimately responsible {{for the performance of}} the company. It is commonly understood that information is a critical resource for CEO’s in formulating strategy and obtaining an essential understanding of the environment in which the CEO operates. Increased technology and communications has meant that obtaining and analysing information is much easier than ever before. The difficulty for CEO’s is determining which information they require to prevent information overload. PURPOSE The purpose of this research is to examine the nature of CEO work. In this research, the researcher will use Mintzberg’s ten point framework to analyse the role of Irish CEO’s in the 21 st century. Furthermore, the researcher aims to illustrate the information needs and information seeking behaviours of Irish CEO s’, and their insights into the usefulness of information systems. FINDINGS The research indicates that the role of CEO s examined is strategic in nature. Source quality, uncertainty and task complexity influence the information needs and seeking behaviour of CEO s. CEO s predominantly use internal personal and impersonal sources of information, requesting information from subordinate managers most frequently. Chief Financial Officers are integral for the effective implementation of information systems, especially in larger more complex companies. However, the CFO is also responsible for information systems investment and development due to <b>accounting</b> <b>and</b> <b>inventory</b> control systems, especially in smaller firms who lack the resources to employ a Chief Information Officer The problem of integrating information systems is a major problem experienced by companies in the research. High investment costs are also experienced by companies, especially by the largest companies with more complex operations and the smallest companies who suffer from lack of resources. FUTURE RESEARCH The research presents a foundation for further research in the area. Further exploratory research could be conducted on the work of CEO s, to provide a greater picture of their work. The research established that numerous companies included in the population employed a Chief Information Officer. There currently is a gap in the knowledge regarding their roles {{and the nature of the}} work in the Irish context...|$|E

In particular, zemleohoronni measures {{in the developed world}} are implemented through rural development policy, based on the conduct of the common agricultural policy, the creation of funds to support farmers, provide technical assistance, development of national programs and future development plans. For the European Union development policy documents on the development of land areas for 5 - 10 years - the overall trend. Land management activities are conducted in foreign countries on the basis of approved design documentation for land management different direction. Found that the use of land and resource potential in the world is subject to the requirements of environmental safety. Agrarian relations in these countries are based on incentive levers, with direct execution of the rules of use and protection of land. By 2020, the strategy of the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union provides funding for joint agricultural market, direct subsidies to farmers and stimulate agricultural development. Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union for its activities fully demonstrates the ability of European economies to maintain the same level of development. State administration of environmental impact on the economic interests of the tenure or land use in countries with market economies include: tax exemptions (to make environmentally oriented activities), soft loans (available on interest rates for environmental investments), subsidies (for the implementation of environmental programs) and subsidies (for growing products without pesticides) entities. It is proved that the system of economic instruments in environmental policy Ukraine needs to improve, because it is poorly developed. Experience in other countries shows that as we strengthen land management tools (instruments for land administration), and its supporting tools to succeed in the system of rational land use. By tools include: a) political system; b) planning of land use; c) the economic and legal methods of state regulation of land relations and land market; d) guarantee of land ownership, land ownership and land use, taxation of land. By supporting tools include: a) the registration of rights to land, b) land cadastre) the arrangements for evaluation, <b>accounting</b> <b>and</b> <b>inventory</b> of land use and others. For the improvement of the economic levers offer: 1) to work out mechanisms refund agrarian agricultural land ownership and land use using innovative technologies for the conservation and protection of soil; 2) simplify the subsidies, grants, benefits for land users at the expense of local budgets (from the land tax and compensation of losses of agricultural and forestry production); 3) Improve mechanisms to stimulate rational land use. In addition, it is believed that it should be the private owners of the major organizations that implement environmental policy for the protection of land and carrying out effective environmental management due to their ownership or land use. Therefore, at the state level need to develop a program to encourage private sector agricultural producers...|$|E
