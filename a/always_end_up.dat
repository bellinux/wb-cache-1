500|$|Fincher {{decided to}} use the digital Thomson Viper Filmstream camera to shoot the film. Fincher had {{previously}} used the Thomson Viper {{over the past three years}} on commercials for Nike, Hewlett Packard, Heineken and Lexus which allowed him to get used to and experiment with the equipment. He was able to use inexpensive desktop software like Final Cut Pro to edit Zodiac. Fincher remarked in an interview, [...] "Dailies almost <b>always</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> being disappointing, like the veil is pierced and you look at it for the first time and think, 'Oh my god, this is what I really have to work with.' But when you can see what you have as it's gathered, it can be a much less neurotic process." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{challenges}} the writers faced was scaling down their ideas to make them feasible for production. [...] Cuse said that he let such ideas flourish because of his relative inexperience with writing for television series. An example given by the writers was Boam's idea for a full-sized [...] "pirate ship on wheels". The writers quickly realized they needed to scale the idea down to something the production designers could create. They settled on putting a full pirate crew on a stagecoach with cannons. Kern said {{it was better to}} [...] "shoot past the mark, and come back to it, rather than start below it". He elaborated on this, saying, [...] "if you envision the 40-foot galleon and go back from that, you'll <b>always</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> with more than if you start out with a pirate on a horse." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris says {{he hates}} classic rock {{stations}} because they <b>always</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> playing We Built This City from Starship. The radio station Chris tunes in to is [...] "Classic Rock 103.7 WHTT". WHTT was the callsign {{for the current}} Boston, MA radio station WODS, a classic hits station {{at the time that}} played the same music the fictional WHTT apparently airs before flipping to Top 40 in 2012 as 103.3 Amp Radio. The station had the callsign from 1983–86. This further references Boston influences on the TV show. Another station actually holds the callsigns now, 104.1 WHTT-FM in Buffalo, NY, with the same format. After Stewie is injected with steroids, he lifts a barbell on one side and says [...] "I have the power!" [...] and the show then shifts scenes the same as in Masters of the Universe. It is mentioned that Connie is the key to One-Eyed Willy’s gold, a reference to The Goonies. Paul Sorvino and Chazz Palminteri are seen acting in a fictional movie called [...] "Distracting Trumpet". After Stewie's steroids injection wears off and he jumps out the bedroom window, the music playing is from the cartoon The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{discussed}} the acting. Peter Gicas of E! News noted that Fox and Monaghan portray [...] "combustible behavior the tune is hellbent on describing." [...] The New York Posts Jarett Wieselman wrote that they play their roles perfectly and {{help make the}} video powerful. Entertainment Weeklys Whitney Pastorek found the violent acting sexually appealing, while Willa Paskin of New York magazine wrote that the cast's appeal [...] "hypnotize" [...] viewers. Paskin noted the use of sepia toning in the burning-house scenes. Matthew Wilkening of AOL Radio commented that the video leaves viewers to decide [...] "if it's a good thing or a bad thing that the pair <b>always</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> reconciling." [...] Mikey Fresh of Vibe commented that Fox's natural reaction when Monaghan pierces the wall and almost hits her is an [...] "incredible act of vulnerability". L Magazines Benjamin Sutton likened the scene in which the characters burn to the Marvel Comics character Chris Bradley, whom Monaghan portrays in the 2009 action film [...] As of October 2017, the video is the site's 33rd most viewed video, with more than 1.4 billion views.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the official EastEnders website, Oberman detailed the background dynamic to Chrissie and Den's relationship as it existed before their appearance on the show: [...] "They were a real match for each other and ran a successful wine bar. The couple made a good team, but he was always going off with other women. She'd end up leaving him, but they'd <b>always</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> back together." [...] Den's womanising and philandering nature was deliberately set against Chrissie's strong and forceful personality, and culminated on-screen in his affair with Kate Mitchell (Jill Halfpenny). The plot was praised by television editor Ru Green as being one of the [...] "better storylines" [...] during an otherwise weak year for the show, with media attention at the time profiling Chrissie's dramatic plans for revenge. Commenting on the storyline's climax, a report in The Sun spotlighted how [...] "instead of collapsing in tears" [...] as many female characters in EastEnders are wont to do, Chrissie [...] "proves that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned". The climax, which saw Chrissie cut off Kate Mitchell's hair in retribution for the affair, was a highlight for Oberman and an important dramatic milestone for her character: [...] "cutting off Jill Halfpenny's hair in the salon... was a really great episode. I loved working with Jill and I think that put Chrissie on the map." ...|$|E
2500|$|Talking to What's on TV, Wallace {{commented on}} Kat's reunion with Alfie. She said: [...] "She punches him! Alfie has {{come looking for}} her and hasn't seen her for months. He keeps saying to her 'You're fat' and she says 'I'm not fat. I'm pregnant!' Then she says, 'Don't worry Alfie, it ain't yours'. She's peed off with him. He's been in prison and she's had to survive on her own pregnant. But she loves him unconditionally. No matter what they do, they will <b>always</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> together. She wants stability... a future for the baby and her. She sets him this {{challenge}} and he buys it." ...|$|E

2500|$|.....if Liverpool can {{get into}} top gear again there is no limit to the city's potential. The scale and {{resilience}} of the buildings and people is amazing – {{it is a world}} city, far more so than London and Manchester. It doesn't feel like anywhere else in Lancashire: comparisons <b>always</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> overseas – Dublin, or Boston, or Hamburg. The city is tremendous, and so, right up to the First World War, were the abilities of the architects who built over it…… The centre is humane and convenient to walk around in, but never loses its scale. And, in spite of the bombings and the carelessness, it is still full of superb buildings. Fifty years ago it must have outdone anything in England."

2500|$|The bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus) {{performs}} a service for “client” fishes (belonging to other species) by removing and eating their ectoparasites. Clients can invite a cleaning session by adopting a typical posture or simply by remaining immobile near a wrasse's cleaning station. They can even form queues while doing so. But cleaning sessions do not <b>always</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> well, because wrasses (or wrasse-mimicking parasitic sabre-toothed blennies) may cheat {{and eat the}} nutritious body mucus of their clients, rather than just the ectoparasites, something that makes the client jolt and sometimes flee. This system {{has been the subject}} of extensive observations which have suggested cognitive abilities on the part of the cleaner wrasses and their clients. For example, clients refrain from soliciting a cleaning session if they have witnessed the cleaning session of the previous client ending badly. [...] Cleaners give the impression of trying to maintain a good reputation, because they cheat less when they see a big audience (a long queue of clients) watching. Cleaners sometimes work as male-female teams, and when the smaller female cheats and bites the client, the larger male chases her off, as if to punish her for having tarnished their reputation.|$|E
