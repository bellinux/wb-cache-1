40|$|This study {{presents}} an exemplar-based nested hyper-rectangle learning model (NHLM) {{which is an}} efficient and accurate supervised classification model. The proposed model {{is based on the}} concept of seeding training data in the Euclidean m-space (where m denotes the number of features) as hyper-rectangles. To express the exceptions, these hyper-rectangles may be nested inside one another to an arbitrary depth. The fast and one-shot learning pro-cedures can adjust weights dynamically when new examples are added. Furthermore, the “second chance ” heuristic is introduced in NHLM to avoid creating more memory objects than necessary. NHLM is applied to solving the land cover classification problem in Taiwan using remote sensed ima-gery. The study investigated five land cover classes and clouds.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyse the relationship between nonlinear dynamic character and individuals’ standing balance by the largest Lyapunov exponent, which is regarded as a metric for assessing standing balance. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>previous</b> <b>study,</b> the largest Lyapunov exponent from centre of pressure time series could not well quantify the human balance ability. In this research, two improvements were made. Firstly, an external stimulus was applied to feet in the form of continuous horizontal sinusoidal motion by a moving platform. Secondly, a multiaccelerometer subsystem was adopted. Twenty healthy volunteers participated in this experiment. A new metric, coordinated largest Lyapunov exponent was proposed, which reflected the relationship of body segments by integrating multidimensional largest Lyapunov exponent values. By using this metric in actual standing performance under sinusoidal stimulus, an obvious relationship between the new metric and the actual balance ability was found in the majority of the subjects. These results show that the sinusoidal stimulus can make human balance characteristics more obvious, which is beneficial to assess balance, and balance is determined by the ability of coordinating all body segments...|$|E

30|$|The {{controlling}} {{factors of}} fracture development are complex {{owing to the}} complicated geological background. Fault systems can be a vital factor in developing fractures where tectonic movements are strong such as the Kuqa Depression of the northern Tarim Basin in the northwestern China (Ju et al. 2014 b) and the Upper Rhine Graben in France and Germany (Johanna et al. 2015); flow may notably promote fracture development where fluid flow or lava flow appears (e.g., Agosta et al. 2010). However, in the Ordos Basin, where the tectonic events are rather weak and the dips of the Mesozoic–Cenozoic strata are less than 3 °, the lithology and the layer thickness are the dominant factors in governing the distribution of fracture density. The relationship between the lithology and the fracture density is still obscure, {{but it may be}} related to the difference of rock physical parameters (Table  1) <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>previous</b> <b>study</b> (e.g., Zeng et al. 2008).

EQ {{is a set of}} abilities such as conception, emotion appraisal and expression, emotion management and regulation, and emotion utilization of emotion. As emotional intelligence is acquisitive and of social origin, parents and children thus expose their emotions in an expressive way to one another, either consciously or unconsciously in their interactions. Adolescence’s alexithymia overlay emotional intelligence in the field of emotion identification and to some extent, in feelings expression. Alexithymic adolescence cannot express emotions orally due to inability in feelings identification, whereas preliminary emotional abilities have specific importance because skillfulness in appraisal and quick precise expression of emotions brings about suitable compatibility in relation with environment and others. The research showed that emotional intelligence is negatively associated with alexithymia. The article is divided into several sections. The review is started with the definition of alexithymia, and this is followed by a review on the alexithymia, as well as the effects and interaction of emotional intelligence.
