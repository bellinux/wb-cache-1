They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E
500|$|Lennon became {{convinced}} that the Maharishi, {{who said he was}} celibate, had made a pass at Farrow or was having relations with other young female students and later called the Maharishi a [...] "lecherous womaniser". [...] According to Mardas an American teacher named Rosalyn Bonas had told both him and Lennon that the Maharishi had made [...] "sexual advances" [...] towards her. However, Cynthia Lennon said she thought Mardas had put the [...] "young and impressionable" [...] girl up to it. Brown recalls that Mardas told him that a young blonde nurse from California had said she'd had a sexual relationship with the Maharishi. In addition, Mardas arranged to spy on the Maharishi when Bonas was with him, and said that he saw the two of them in a compromising position. At the same time, {{many of the people who}} were there, including Harrison, Horn, Cooke de Herrera, Cynthia Lennon and Jennie Boyd did not believe that the Maharishi had made a pass at any woman. According to Cynthia Lennon, Mardas' allegations about the Maharishi's indiscretions with a lady gained momentum [...] "without a single shred of evidence or justification." [...] Likewise McCartney said [...] "It was Magic Alex who made the original accusation <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was completely untrue".|$|E

After the {{assembled}} audience applauded Peres, Erdoğan said: [...] "I {{find it very}} sad that people applaud what you said. You killed people. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is very wrong." [...] The moderator, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius asked Erdoğan to finish, saying that people {{needed to go to}} dinner. Erdoğan complained about the fact, that he was given 12 minutes to talk, whereas Peres talked for a duration of 25 minutes. Erdoğan then proceeded to leave the stage.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the mid-1970s}} {{it has been}} argued by revisionist historians that the style {{attracted}} the attention, in the early 1950s, of the CIA, who saw it as representative of the USA as a haven of free thought and free markets, as well as a challenge to both the socialist realist styles prevalent in communist nations and the dominance of the European art markets. The book by Frances Stonor Saunders, The Cultural Cold War—The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters, (published in the UK as Who Paid the Piper?: CIA and the Cultural Cold War) details how the CIA financed and organized the promotion of American abstract expressionists as part of cultural imperialism via the Congress for Cultural Freedom from 1950 to 1967. Notably Robert Motherwell's series Elegy to the Spanish Republic addressed some of those political issues. Tom Braden, founding chief of the CIA's International Organizations Division (IOD) and ex-executive secretary of the Museum of Modern Art said in an interview, [...] "I think it was the most important division that the agency had, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> played an enormous role in the Cold War." ...|$|E

2500|$|Being {{a period}} of that era of the 1950's <b>I</b> <b>think</b> being gay must have been pretty harsh for Graham.
