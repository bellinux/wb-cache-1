25|$|Relations in {{the family}} Magnoliaceae have been puzzling taxonomists for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Because</b> the family is quite old and has survived many {{geological}} events (such as ice ages, mountain formation, and continental drift), its distribution has become scattered. Some species or groups of species have been isolated for a long time, while others could stay in close contact. To create divisions {{in the family}} (or even within the genus Magnolia), solely based upon morphological characters, {{has proven to be}} a nearly impossible task.|$|E
25|$|On Monday, July 9, 1956, {{a worker}} tearing down the Spring Lake Park School found men's {{clothing}} with dark red stains {{in the attic}} under a table scarf with the same stains. The school was located across the railroad tracks near the scene where Martin's car was found. The clothing {{was sent to the}} state laboratory in Austin, Texas by Texas city police to determine if the stains were human blood. The clothing had been there for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>because</b> they were deteriorating. The clothing consisted of white linen trousers and a white linen shirt and undershirt.|$|E
25|$|During this period, {{the town}} was mostly owned by three families: the Mallocks who owned the Cockington region, the Carys who owned Babbacombe, St Marychurch and the old monastery at Torre Abbey, and the Palk family which owned central Torquay or Tormohun. Tor Mohun {{takes its name from}} the tor or {{conspicuous}} hill known as Tor Hill today, and its suffix from the Mohuns who acquired the manor from the Brewers in the 13th century. The Mallocks resisted the changes convulsing Torquay for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>because</b> they did not want a town on their rural property, and they threw away a fortune rather than have it. It was not until 1865 that one of them consented to grant a building lease, and that only to a family connection.|$|E

25|$|After {{the fall}} of Norfolk, Virginia in May 1862, the {{importance}} of Wilmington was further increased. It became the main Confederate port on the Atlantic Ocean. Considering the Atlantic seashore, Wilmington's defenses were so sturdy that they were only surpassed by Charleston's, in South Carolina. Wilmington resisted for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> mainly <b>because</b> of Fort Fisher's presence.|$|R

25|$|After World War II ended, and the Republic of China {{took over}} Taiwan, Lee {{enrolled}} in the National Taiwan University, where in 1948 he earned a bachelor's degree in agricultural science. Lee joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) for two stints, in September 1946 and October or November 1947, both times briefly. Lee began the New Democracy Association with four others. This group was absorbed by the CPC, and Lee officially left the party in September 1948. In a 2002 interview Lee himself {{admitted that he had}} been a Communist. In that same interview Lee said that he has strongly opposed Communism for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>because</b> he understands the theory well and knows that it is doomed to fail. Lee stated that he joined the Communists out of hatred for the KMT.|$|E
25|$|Platinum {{was first}} used for minting coins in Spanish-colonized America. Following the {{discovery}} of platinum in gold rocks, the Spaniards were unable {{to use it for}} <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>because</b> they had no technology for processing this metal. The then-cheap platinum was used for various kinds of frauds, such as substituting it for the more expensive silver. After the discovery that platinum alloys with gold, counterfeiters began to add it to gold coins. The platinum confiscated from counterfeiters was then thrown into the sea, in accordance with the royal decree of 1735. Later, the practice of adding platinum to gold as a ligature was adopted by the authorities in Spain in order to lower the gold content of coins. Also in Spain, in the mid-19th century, counterfeiters began producing British Sovereigns out of a gold-plated alloy of platinum and copper, relying on a similar specific weight of platinum and gold.|$|E
25|$|After the Sanhedrin trial Jesus {{is taken}} to Pilate's court in the praetorium. Only in the Gospel of Luke, finding that Jesus, being from Galilee, belonged to Herod Antipas' jurisdiction, Pilate decides to send Jesus to Herod. Herod Antipas (the same man who had {{previously}} ordered the death of John the Baptist) had wanted to see Jesus for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> <b>because</b> he had been hoping to observe one of the miracles of Jesus. However, Jesus says almost nothing in response to Herod's questions, or the vehement accusations of the chief priests and the scribes. Herod and his soldiers mock Jesus, put a gorgeous robe on him, as the King of the Jews, and sent him back to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate become friends with each other that day: for before they were at enmity. After questioning Jesus and receiving very few replies, Herod sees Jesus as no threat and returns him to Pilate.|$|E

25|$|Such {{a balance}} is seen more simply in sickle-cell anaemia, which is found mostly in {{tropical}} populations in Africa and India. An individual homozygous for the recessive sickle hemoglobin, HgbS, has a short expectancy of life, whereas {{the life expectancy}} of the standard hemoglobin (HgbA) homozygote and also the heterozygote is normal (though heterozygote individuals will suffer periodic problems). The sickle-cell variant survives in the population because the heterozygote is resistant to malaria and the malarial parasite kills {{a huge number of}} people each year. This is balancing selection or genetic polymorphism, balanced between fierce selection against homozygous sickle-cell sufferers, and selection against the standard HgbA homozygotes by malaria. The heterozygote has a permanent advantage (a higher fitness) so long as malaria exists; and it has existed as a human parasite for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Because</b> the heterozygote survives, so does the HgbS allele survive at a rate much higher than the mutation rate (see and refs in Sickle-cell disease).|$|E
25|$|The daguerreotypes {{were not}} without drawbacks, however. The main {{difficulty}} {{was that they}} could only be reproduced by photographing the original picture since each image was an original and the all-metal process does not use negatives. In addition, the earliest daguerreotypes had exposure times ranging from three to fifteen minutes, making them somewhat impractical for portraiture. Unlike earlier drawings, action could not be shown. The poses that the models struck had to be held very still for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Because</b> of this, the standard pornographic image shifted from one {{of two or more}} people engaged in sex acts to a solitary woman exposing her genitals. Since one picture could cost a week's salary, the audience for these nudes mostly consisted of artists and the upper echelon of society. It was cheaper to hire a prostitute and experience the sex acts than it was to own a picture of them in the 1840s. Stereoscopy was invented in 1838 and became extremely popular for daguerreotypes, including the erotic images. This technology produced a type of three dimensional view that suited erotic images quite well. Although thousands of erotic daguerreotypes were created, only around 800 are known to survive; however, their uniqueness and expense meant that they were once the toys of rich men. Due to their rarity, the works can sell for more than 10,000 GBP.|$|E
500|$|Early in the season, Diekman {{emerged as}} a {{reliable}} reliever in the Phillies' bullpen, and was used extensively by manager Ryne Sandberg. As the season progressed, Diekman was more successful against left-handed hitters than right-handed hitters, but was used against both {{in a variety of}} situations. On September 1, 2014, Diekman was one of four pitchers who combined for a no-hitter in the Phillies' 7-0 win over the Atlanta Braves in Turner Field. By the end of the season, the Phillies had one of the best bullpens in the league, and it consisted predominantly of young players such as Diekman. There was excitement from both Phillies' personnel and writers that the bullpen could remain solid for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>because</b> of young pitchers such as Diekman, Ken Giles, and Justin De Fratus. Moreover, Diekman and Giles had potential as closers should the Phillies trade Jonathan Papelbon. Overall, Diekman {{emerged as a}} name to be mentioned among the [...] "elite" [...] relievers of the National League, but was overused against right-handed batters, which hurt his statistics.|$|E

500|$|Audio {{tracks were}} mixed with {{recorded}} sounds from real subway cars, {{as well as}} PA system announcements, to make the episode sound more authentic. In the original episode, Pembleton grabbed Biedron by {{the collar of his}} shirt while Biedron sat {{in the back of a}} squad car during one of the final scenes. The scene was modified so that Pembleton only looked at Biedron, because Yoshimura felt that the scene was just as effective without him grabbing Biedron. During the last scene of the episode, in which Lange's girlfriend jogs by the subway station and ignores the emergency vehicles, Rabinowitz was originally instructed to include a musical score. He tried many different types of music, including rock music, Irish music, classical music, jazz, and piano riffs. When none of the music worked, Fontana suggested including no music at all, and it was agreed the silence was the most effective solution. Fontana said that after watching the episode repeatedly during the editing process, he liked the final product but doubted he would watch it again for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>because</b> it was [...] "too emotionally draining".|$|E

2500|$|This {{system was}} used for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> <b>because</b> it {{was used for}} phrase-books {{and part of the}} Yale system of {{teaching}} Chinese.
