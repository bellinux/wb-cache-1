50|$|The {{potential}} {{negative impact}} of the NPPF on <b>UK</b> <b>archaeology</b> has been heavily debated, with archaeologists noting that there {{is likely to be}} considerable tension between the immediate-term impacts of the process of government deregulation in the NPPF and the medium-term impacts of another key government priority - its localism agenda as enshrined in the Localism Act of 2011, which places much greater planning control in the hands of local communities. The NPPF is likely to encourage development through its streamlined planning system, but the Localism Act of 2011 is equally likely to stall development through its commitment to local communities having a greater say in what is (and crucially is not) built in their neighbourhood, a process likely to block many developments.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s a {{consensus}} {{developed in the}} field of archaeology that archaeological data in digital form was highly fragile due to both an inadequate understanding of technical threats to its sustainability and the lack of an infrastructure to preserve it in the long term. In April 1996 a consortium comprising eight Departments of <b>Archaeology</b> from <b>UK</b> Universities joined forces with the Council for British Archaeology (CBA) to put a proposal to the Arts and Humanities Data Service Executive to establish an Archaeology Data Service. This service was to host a digital archive for archaeologists and to provide advice and guidance to the archaeological community on how to create and manage their digital datasets. As a result, the ADS was established at the University of York Department of Archaeology in September 1996 with two full-time members of staff and under the directorship of Professor Julian D. Richards. From 1996 until 2008 the ADS hosted AHDS Archaeology, a subject centre devoted to archaeology funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council via the AHDS. The AHDS closed in March 2008 {{as a result of a}} controversial decision by the AHRC to withdraw funding. The ADS now receives funding directly from AHRC, rather than through the AHDS, it is also funded by other Higher Education and cultural heritage sector organisations including the European Union.|$|R
40|$|Participant {{observation}} {{has been}} the subject of intense debate amongst anthropologists in recent years, but it continues to be the methodological foundation of research within our discipline. Little thought has been given, however, to the extent to which a researcher’s participation in a social milieu can be properly assessed. I examine this issue in the light of two periods of participatory research in contrasting social environments, that of academic <b>archaeology</b> in the <b>UK</b> and a rapidly modernising, urban community in Nepal. I argue that participation is not simply a matter of ‘acting like’ or ‘doing things like’ people of another society. Instead, a researcher’s participation is a concomitant of his or her own changing socio-political position, and must be compared with the diversity of subject positions within the host society if the character of this participation is to be properly understood...|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} {{cultural heritage}} economy {{has long been}} underpinned by a reserve army of unemployed/underemployed labour. The entry-level workforce is being further undermined and unpaid/underpaid labour is additionally being consolidated through the crisis and austerity measures. Independently and under different pressures, archaeologists across Europe have begun to use blogging, micro-blogging and other social media in concerted national efforts to document, analyse and resist exploitative and exclusive employment practices. This article focuses {{on the development of}} movements against unpaid labour (free <b>archaeology)</b> in the <b>UK,</b> against unpaid and underpaid internship (volontariato and stage) in Italy, and for employment (istihdam) in Turkey. Using insights gained through observing and participating in these movements, and through running a research blog on precarious labour in the cultural heritage industry, this article examines the benefits and limits of blogging/micro-blogging as a tool for debate within the profession, communication with the public, and activism. ...|$|R

A 1968 review by the Society for Medieval <b>Archaeology</b> of the <b>UK</b> proposed that it was a woolen cloth known for a broken diamond texture that was required by early looms. As one of three kinds of cloth named in the Magna Carta and in a variety of other medieval sources, it {{is believed to have been}} a major article of commerce in the 12th and 13th centuries. The cloth could be dyed green, 'peacock', dark brown, or in grain, and was available in coarse, good, or fine qualities, selling from 5.5d. to 4s. a yard. As such it could compete with griseng for use by the poor, or might be of a grade suitable for royalty.|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the age of}} a given {{site has}} always {{played a central role}} in archaeology. The {{principal}} scientific dating technique used within archaeology is radiocarbon dating, but there are many other techniques that offer advantages to the archaeologists in different situations. Archaeomagnetic dating is one such technique that uses the properties of the Earth's magnetic field to produce a date. A project entitled 'Magnetic Moments in the Past' was launched by the University of Bradford and English Heritage to develop archaeomagnetic dating for application in <b>UK</b> <b>archaeology,</b> funded as part of the AHRC's Knowledge Transfer Fellowship scheme (reference AH/G 01020 X/ 1).

40|$|Digital Public Archaeology is a {{very new}} label for a {{contemporary}} practice, and as such has been subject to {{a limited amount of}} theoretical scrutiny. The rapid pace of change within Internet technologies has significantly expanded potential for this ‘digital’ form of Public Archaeology practice. Internet technologies can be used to gather contributions of ‘crowd-sourced’ archaeological content; to share and discuss archaeological news and discoveries; foster online community identity, situated around the topic of archaeology and wider heritage issues, or to elicit financial support. Expectations of and opportunities for social, collaborative and individual participation and interaction with cultural heritage have grown accordingly. Professional archaeological organisations are increasingly encouraged, if not required, to disseminate their grey literature reports, publications, educational resources, data-sets, images and other archaeological informatics through digital means, frequently as mandatory outputs for impact assessment and public accountability. Real-time sharing, comment and feedback of archaeological information online and via mobile technologies stand in contrast to lengthy waits for publication and wider dissemination. This paper will explore the literature on the practice of Public <b>Archaeology</b> in the <b>UK,</b> and issues associated with the development of digital public engagement in the heritage sector. </span...|$|R
5000|$|Critics of PPG 16 {{argue that}} the commercialization of <b>UK</b> <b>archaeology</b> has {{resulted}} in more work of lower quality being undertaken, and that a shortage of county archaeologists to monitor this work allows consultants to exploit the situation. In recent years prices have been driven down by competing consultants who have unethical arrangements with archaeological contractors, who rather than performing the same job for a lower cost (as in true competitive tendering) {{are able to do}} a worse job. The increased volume of work has led to a backlog of unpublished site reports and homeless site archives awaiting resolution. The competition for work amongst archaeologists, {{and the fact that the}} developers funding them see no real use for their final product, also tends to drive prices down meaning that wages and conditions for archaeologists in the UK are generally far below the national average for equivalent professions with comparable levels of education. The irony is that the cost of this unworthy body of work, known as [...] "grey archaeology", borne by the construction industry benefits nobody but the consultants who have something to [...] "mitigate" [...] on behalf of their clients in the construction industry.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{advances}} {{existing literature}} and knowledge about public engagement in archaeology. Based on extensive, {{quantitative and qualitative}} audience research, it examines how the UK public perceive and experience archaeology, and suggests policy ‘strategies’ through which archaeological communication can be improved. First a theoretical framework of archaeological communication is developed; this allows the comparative examination {{of the ways in}} which experiences of archaeology are differently configured, depending on the contexts of communication (personal, social and physical), content and discourse. The framework has been used to conduct three large-scale surveys (samples of 500 people were used) : a survey of visitors to the Medieval Gallery of the Museum of London (London, UK), one of Facebook fans of the TV series 'Time Team', and a survey of visitors to the exhibition 'From Petra to Shawbak. Archaeology of a Frontier' (Florence, Italy). From such programme, a better understanding is gained of the composition of the public for <b>archaeology,</b> in the <b>UK</b> (and comparatively in Italy), {{of the ways in which}} they participate, and of the real and perceived benefits that derive from public engagement in archaeology. Finally, templates of public engagement designed for university departments, museum institutions and Public Service Broadcasting are proposed, and prospects of future research outlined...|$|R

40|$|Capitalist logic, {{its impact}} on the {{practice}} of archaeology, and on the professional lives of those who participate within its political economy are the subject for this analysis. I have chosen as my unit of analysis commercial archaeology in Quebec, Canada. This context was chosen because of its progressive transformation from a semi, state-regulated archaeological system to one that is competitive and comparable to those found in the UK and the USA. Commercial archaeology, as governed by a neoliberal economic system, has fundamentally altered how archaeology?s contributions are brought about, maintained and disseminated. But what about those who produce archaeology, has their relationship to the profession changed as a result of neoliberal economics? The objective of this thesis is to address and evaluate the argument against neoliberal economics and contribute to current critiques regarding capitalist economics by posing the following question: does the implementation of a neoliberal economy in archaeology sustain the accomplishment of a meaningful and valuable archaeological activity for archaeologists and the public? Within this dissertation, an ethnographic approach to data collection permits the exploration of the experience of socioeconomic changes upon the lives of archaeologists, experience which is articulated in their own discourses. I also employ qualitative demographic and economic data, and participant observation. The characteristics of the archaeological network in Quebec are further illustrated through a comparative analysis with the system of commercial <b>archaeology</b> in the <b>UK.</b> Research results demonstrate that the present market economy is harmful to the development of archaeological products, primarily because of the alienation of the product from the archaeologists and the public. Alternatives to the current economic system have been developed. However, these options suffer from under-funding. I propose that new models of practice for archaeology must be explored and given credence, {{if there is to be}} a perpetuation of the profession within the cultural landscape of western societies...|$|R
40|$|Archaeology {{undertook}} {{a process of}} definition and exclusivity {{in order to develop}} as a discipline. It justified its increasing control and management of the archaeological resource as being on behalf of the public. This has been challenged by the concept of community archaeology, which was originally defined as a collaborative process, where non-archaeologists are considered equal partners in the research process. In the <b>UK</b> local <b>archaeology</b> societies have been interpreted as community archaeology. They developed in parallel to the profession and are traditionally managed by and for volunteers, some of whom have considerable archaeological experience. The term community archaeology has also been used to describe a much wider range of projects, many of which have been stimulated by professional organisations wishing to demonstrate impact. These usually, but not always, aim to engage the community through participation. There has been some theoretical discussion about community archaeology. This has predominantly revolved around definition but little research has taken place into the practice occurring within the UK. This has resulted in a lack of published guidance. This PhD thesis will start to fill this gap. It considers the concept of community archaeology and its relationship with professional archaeology. In particular it focuses upon the concept of the volunteer and the local archaeology society. The research used a qualitative approach to understand current practice. Interviews with volunteers from local archaeology societies identified that they conduct archaeological research for a range of reasons. Primarily these are site accessibility and personal interest however volunteers are also motivated by a sense of wider purpose and they desire to conduct their research to professional standards. The thesis compares this to interviews with professional archaeologists, who value these societies for the support that they provide to the archaeological profession. Case study projects were used as a second methodology to explore the practice of community <b>archaeology</b> in the <b>UK</b> upon theoretical guidance, and in particular the concept of collaboration in. Volunteers in archaeology look towards professional archaeologists to provide guidance, identifying them as experts. They also require a range of different archaeological experiences. Relationships between the public, experienced volunteers and professional archaeologists were demonstrated to be complex and these categories are not exclusive. The research concludes that community archaeology has previously been described as a bottom up or collaborative practice, this research demonstrates that the practice has evolved and that now many examples conform to the Authorised Heritage Discourse. This has created a lack of guidance; in response this PhD presents a model of best practice for professional and volunteer archaeologists. This will ensure that community archaeology is practiced to the maximum benefit of all involved...|$|R
40|$|About the book] In 1991, sports divers {{discovered}} a previously unknown section of wooden shipwreck, subsequently named Alum Bay 1, {{lying in the}} sheltered waters of Alum Bay on the north-west coast of the Isle of Wight. The identity of the vessel was initially unknown but it was strongly linked {{to the loss of}} the 38 -gun frigate HMS Pomone on the nearby Needles in 1811, an identification formally confirmed by the research detailed in this monograph. Archaeological work on the site since 1993 has comprised a seabed survey of the site, targeted excavation of specific areas and sampling of structural remains for dendrochronological and metallurgical analysis. In 2001, a second shipwreck was {{discovered a}} short distance away and the focus of archaeological work shifted to this new set of remains, named Alum Bay 2. This vessel proved to be a much smaller vessel that was upturned on the seabed and covered by a thin layer of sediment. This vessel was also subject to archaeological survey and investigation, including dendrochronological analysis. On the basis of the ship structure surviving on the seabed, Alum Bay 2 has been classified as a relatively small vessel that was likely to have been involved in local transport or coastal trade in the very late 18 th century and early decades of the 19 th century. The role of public engagement in the management of such archaeological sites was developed further in the mid- 2000 s when a dive trail was established around the two Alum Bay shipwrecks. The dive trail in Alum Bay provides an interesting case study in this form of archaeological interaction with the diving public. In concert with such outreach work, further archaeological survey was been undertaken across Alum Bay in the light of a number of isolated finds being reported by sports divers including parts of cannon carriages and hull elements. Investigative work in Alum Bay has also encompassed the broken remains of the Victorian Pier that was constructed in 1887 to serve the growing boom in seaside tourism. The two shipwrecks of Alum Bay 1 and 2 provide a snapshot of two different aspects of English shipbuilding, naval and merchant, in the very late 18 th and early 19 th century. The archaeological work conducted in their investigation forms the core of this monograph, with further chapters that discuss the wider searches of Alum Bay and also the installation and use of the public Alum Bay Dive Trail. Such an account represents the results of twenty years of archaeological investigation within Alum Bay by the Maritime Archaeology Trust (which incorporates the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology). This work has been undertaken across a time span in which maritime <b>archaeology</b> in the <b>UK</b> has seen tremendous changes, becoming ever more integrated into the wider heritage discipline and with increasing numbers of professional archaeologists working within the marine zone. Throughout this period, archaeological work in Alum Bay has brought together professional and a-vocational archaeologists, who have worked successfully alongside each other. The various fieldwork seasons have provided extensive opportunities for people to receive archaeological training and develop their experience. This monograph therefore represents the last stage of this work, addressing the processing, analysis, interpretation and finally publication and dissemination. ...|$|R
