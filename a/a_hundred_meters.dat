It is partly hewed in massive solid rock; its composition was, in all probability, largely influenced by the shape of the cave which existed there. The chapel, rectangular in plan and having a horseshoe-shaped apse, is adjoined, from the east and from the northeast, by passages and annexes hewed at various levels and even one on top of another.|$|E
25|$|The {{specifics}} of Paleo-Indian migration to {{and throughout the}} Americas, including the exact dates and routes traveled, are subject to ongoing research and discussion. The traditional theory has been that these early migrants moved into the Beringia land bridge between eastern Siberia and present-day Alaska around 40,000 – 17,000 years ago, when sea levels were significantly lowered due to the Quaternary glaciation. These people {{are believed to have}} followed herds of now-extinct pleistocene megafauna along ice-free corridors that stretched between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets. Another route proposed is that, either on foot or using primitive boats, they migrated down the Pacific Northwest coast to South America. Evidence of the latter would since have been covered by a sea level rise of <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>meters</b> following the last ice age.|$|E

500|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Weizsäcker joined the German army, ultimately rising to the rank of Captain in the Reserves. He joined his brother Heinrich's regiment, the Infantry Regiment 9 Potsdam. He crossed over the border to Poland with his regiment on the very first day of the war. His brother Heinrich was killed about <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>meters</b> away from him on the second day. Weizsäcker watched over his brother's body through the night, until he was able to bury him the next morning. His regiment, consisting in a large part of noble and conservative Prussians, played a significant part in the 20 July plot, with no fewer than nineteen of its officers involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. Weizsäcker himself helped his friend Axel von dem Bussche in an attempt to kill Hitler at a uniform inspection in December 1943, providing Bussche with travel papers to Berlin. The attempt had to be called off when the uniforms were destroyed by an air raid. Upon meeting Bussche in June 1944, Weizsäcker was also informed of the imminent plans for 20 July, and assured him of his support, but the plan ultimately failed. Weizsäcker later described the last nine months of the war as [...] "agony". He was wounded in East Prussia in 1945 and was transported home to Stuttgart, to see out {{the end of the war}} on a family farm at Lake Constance.|$|E

2500|$|In April 1907, a tram began {{operation}} in Kiruna, the northernmost in the world. This meant miners {{would no longer}} have to walk several kilometers through the sub-arctic cold, nor would they need to climb <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>meters</b> up the mining hill. The network consisted of three lines: bergbanan (funicular), stadsspårvägen (city tramway) and gruvspårvägen (mine tramway). The funicular closed in 1955 after a road up the mine was built 1949. The city line had a maximum length of [...] and was unique due to the 1-meter gauge, double windows and heated wagons. It closed in 1958 after gradually being replaced by buses. Between 1941 and 1964, a tram was used inside the mine, with wagons bought from closed tramlines throughout Sweden.|$|E
2500|$|Liepāja {{enjoys a}} semi-continental climate noted as [...] "Dfb" [...] in the Köppen classification. The major factor {{influencing}} {{the weather in}} the region is the Baltic Sea, providing a relatively mild winter for its high latitude (although snowy) and a relatively cool summer. During the winter the sea around Liepāja is virtually ice-free. Although occasionally some land-fast ice may develop, it seldom reaches <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>meters</b> from the shore and does not last long before melting. The sea warms up fully only in the beginning of August, so the best bathing season in Liepāja is from August to September. Summers are more affected by the martime climate than east-facing cities on similar latitudes in opposite Sweden, but winters are milder than inland areas to the east. Regular meteorological observations in the city have been conducted from 1857.|$|E

Original: [...] "It is a person's right to be a radical leftist, and publish a newspaper in accordance with his world view... However Haaretz has reached the point where its anti-Zionism has become stupid and evil", she wrote. She also accused Levy of amateurism because he does not speak Arabic.|$|E

2500|$|Nikolayev {{fought in}} the Winter War as a driver in the 824th Motor Transport Battalion. On 22 June 1941, he was {{stationed}} with the 13th Tank Brigade. He {{fought in the}} early stages of the Siege of Leningrad. When the tank brigade was sent to reform in the area of Staraya Russa, Nikolayev transferred to become a driver in the 128th Rifle Division's 15th Motor Transport Battalion. The remnants of the division retreated into the Sinyavino swamps. After Nikolayev's truck was destroyed in a bombing raid, he fought with a rifle platoon. By then a senior sergeant, Nikolayev became the platoon commander. In December, German infantry began to attack. After letting the German troops advance <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>meters,</b> the platoon opened fire with machine guns. Reportedly, none of the German troops escaped and eleven wounded were taken prisoner. He became a candidate member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in February and was promoted to junior lieutenant.

[...] After the patrol had captured two German prisoners and was preparing to withdraw, it was ordered to occupy the trench.
