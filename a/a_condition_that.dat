50|$|The {{principle}} <b>that</b> <b>an</b> implied <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> {{ceases to}} exist voids the contract {{stems from the}} case of Taylor v Caldwell, which, in turn, was borrowed from Roman law.

5|$|Growing up, Lucic {{attended}} Killarney Secondary in Vancouver.

At the age of 15, he was diagnosed with Scheuermann's disease, <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> can cause the upper back to curve and has given Lucic a hunched-over posture.|$|E
5|$|His {{marriage}} with Jobst soon collapsed and they divorced. He married twice thereafter and his third wife, Helga Schröck (whom he married in May 1959), {{gave birth to}} a son, Hermann-Ulrich, in 1959, and a daughter, Birgit, in 1961. In 1965, Graf was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> seemed to affect many former high-altitude flyers and which caused his health to slowly deteriorate. Graf died in his hometown of Engen on 4 November 1988.|$|E

While Eisenhower insisted on linking a test ban to a broader disarmament effort (e.g., the production cut-off), Moscow insisted on independent consideration of a test ban.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog {{is one of}} the dog breeds {{affected}} by progressive retinal atrophy. It has the most common form, progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> causes the rods and cones in the retina of the eye to deteriorate later in life, resulting in blindness. PRCD is an autosomal recessive trait and a dog can be a carrier of the affected gene without developing the condition.|$|E
5|$|While {{shooting}} the final scenes on the wharf of Fiumicino, Fellini suffered a severe bout of clinical depression, <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> {{he and his}} associates tried to keep secret.

5|$|A {{score of}} veteran {{officers}} became teachers at his military school. Luna devised two courses of instruction, planned the reorganization, with {{a battalion of}} tiradores and a cavalry squadron, set up an inventory of guns and ammunition, arsenals, using convents and town halls, quartermasters, lookouts and communication systems. He built trenches {{with the help of}} his chief engineer, General Jose Alejandrino, and had his brother Juan design the school's uniforms (the Filipino rayadillo). He also insisted on strict discipline over and above clan armies and regional loyalties, which prevented coordination between various military units. Envisioning one united army for the Republic, clan armies and regional loyalties presented a lack of national consciousness. It was also <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> the Spanish utilized to keep the native contingent of their armed forces within check. Soldiers of one region were used to fight revolts in other regions.|$|E

5|$|As he grew older, Sadler {{generally}} {{remained in}} good health, {{with the exception}} of <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> led to the removal of an eye. He died on April 26, 1969, at 93 years of age. Christensen recalls that Sadler was visited by friends and family while on his deathbed; he spoke to them of his confidence in a joyful life after death. He received a full-column obituary in the Chicago Tribune, which discussed his success as a doctor but not his association with The Urantia Book.|$|E
5|$|Digital Devil Saga duology's protagonists {{are silent}} Serph, {{leader of the}} Embryon and Sera, a woman who can commune with God. The other Embryon are the kind Argilla the hot-tempered Heat the light-hearted Cielo and the highly logical Gale. The main {{antagonist}} is Angel, who is Sera's intersexual biological parent. In Digital Devil Saga 2, two new main characters are introduced Roland, the alcoholic leader of the Lokapala resistance group and Madame Margot Cuvier, head of the Karma Society. All the main characters barring Cuvier become infected with the demon virus, <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> causes them to turn into demonic beings and lust after human flesh.|$|E
5|$|For the {{commanding}} officers stationed on the Aleutian Islands during the Aleutian Islands campaign, attacking the Kuril Islands from the Aleutians was a logical continuation to recapturing Attu and Kiska. However, these officers faced resistance from their superiors in Washington and their {{troops on the}} ground. Troop morale had sharply declined {{as a result of}} the island's dismal conditions, creating <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> the troops called the 'Aleutian stare' amongst those who had been on the island for more than six months. An American assault of the Kuriles never materialised.|$|E

5|$|In a final vain attempt, Roosevelt's Secretary of State Cordell Hull sent a {{telegram}} on 4 June to the Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew instructing {{him that the}} United States would still accept a cap of 14-inch guns {{if he could get}} Japan to as well. The Japanese replied that they could not accept this unless the number of battleships was also limited; they wanted the United States and the United Kingdom to agree to having an equal number of battleships with Japan, but this was <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> the two countries refused to accept. On 24 June, the two North Carolinas were ordered with the 14-inch weapons, but on 10 July, Roosevelt directed that they be armed with triple 16-inch instead.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the damage done by}} the bullet, the autopsy also found that the President was suffering from cardiomyopathy (fatty degeneration of the heart muscle). This would have weakened his heart and made him less able to recover from such an injury, and was thought to be related to his overweight frame and lack of exercise. Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic necrosis, <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> is difficult to treat today and would have been completely impossible for the doctors of his time.|$|E
5|$|Lambert–Eaton myasthenic {{syndrome}} (LEMS) {{is a rare}} autoimmune disorder {{characterized by}} muscle weakness of the limbs. It {{is the result of}} an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies are formed against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and the muscle that they supply). The prevalence is 3.4 cases per million. Around 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer; it is therefore regarded as a paraneoplastic syndrome (<b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> arises as a result of cancer elsewhere in the body).|$|E

5|$|Liverpool {{finished}} the 1984–85 Football League {{in second place}} 13 points behind local rivals Everton. They also reached {{the final of the}} 1984–85 European Cup, which they lost 1–0 to Juventus. However the events of the match were overshadowed for the disaster that occurred before kick-off. Liverpool fans breached a fence separating the two groups of supporters and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 people and injuring hundreds. English clubs were banned indefinitely from European competition, with <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> when the ban was lifted, Liverpool would serve an extra three-year ban. The ban eventually lasted for five years, clubs returning to European competition in the 1990–91 season.|$|E
5|$|Seneb's {{dwarfism}} {{is depicted}} realistically in the sculpture. It portrays {{him with a}} large head but small arms and legs. This possibly indicates that he had achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism that most severely affects the fastest-growing {{parts of the body}} – particularly the femur and humerus, which become short and squat – and stunts the forearms and lower legs. It also affects the head, producing a relatively large skull with a bulging forehead and often a depressed nasal bridge. An alternative diagnosis is dysmelia – <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> produces short arms and legs. Seneb's wife Senites is portrayed far less realistically; her depiction is of a piece with other contemporary portraits of high-ranking Egyptian women.|$|E
5|$|Several {{types of}} {{irregular}} construction styles {{were incorporated into}} the building that contributed to its mass and strength not being uniform throughout the structure. These differences in strength allowed damage to be concentrated {{in one or more}} areas rather than being distributed equally and reduced the building's ability to sustain the tremors. Two of the irregularities of the building were the end shear walls that stopped below the second floor and the first floor carrying its load via square support columns. The result of the design was that the first floor was less stiff than the upper floors, and during the earthquake the building sustained uneven damage distribution, <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> may have led to the complete collapse of the building in a larger earthquake. Because of its failure at the foundation and first floor level, the building was considered a total loss and was ultimately demolished.|$|E
