25|$|The Butler Petrol Cycle was a {{three-wheeled}} vehicle, {{with the}} rear wheel directly driven by a 5/8hp (466W) 600 cc (40 in3; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm}) flat twin four stroke engine (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery) equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor (five years before Maybach) and <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering,</b> {{all of which were}} state of the art at the time. Starting was by compressed air. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a throttle valve lever. No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels. It wasn't, however, a success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing.|$|E

50|$|They feature <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> {{geometry}} {{which allowed}} {{the car to}} make U-turns in just 7.6m (25 ft), a requirement for the narrow roads of London.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> {{geometry}} is a geometric {{arrangement of}} linkages in the steering {{of a car}} or other vehicle designed {{to solve the problem}} of wheels on the inside and outside of a turn needing to trace out circles of different radii.|$|E
50|$|Georg Lankensperger (also: Lankensberger), (31 March 1779 - 11 July 1847) was a German wheelwright {{who invented}} the {{steering}} mechanism that is today known as <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> geometry. He patented the invention in Germany, but his agent Rudolph Ackermann filed for the patent in the U.K.|$|E
50|$|The front {{suspension}} is also {{combined with}} a steering mechanism allowing the front wheels to turn. The steering rack {{is the same as}} the one on vintage mini coopers which was chosen due to its high performance and ease of implementation. <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> geometries were incorporated resulting in a vehicle which handles superbly well despite its unusual shape.|$|E
50|$|Rail {{vehicle wheels}} are usually {{mounted on a}} solid axle, so they turn at the same speed. When a vehicle turns the outer wheel has to travel further than the inner wheel. On a road vehicle, this is usually {{achieved}} by allowing the wheels to move independently, and fixing the front wheels in an arrangement known as <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> geometry.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> {{separates}} the steering movement into two pivots, one near {{the hub of}} each front wheel. The beam axle between them remains fixed relative to the chassis, linked by the suspension. <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> has the two advantages that it reduces tyre scrub, the need to drag tyres sideways across their tread when turning the steering, and also it reduced bump steer, suspension and road bumps tending to upset the steering direction. The kingpins were now fixed to the axle ends and the hub carriers pivoted upon them. Most commonly {{the centre of the}} kingpin was fixed in the axle and the hub carrier was forked to fit over this, but some vehicles, including the Ford Model T illustrated, used a forked axle and a kingpin fixed into a single piece carrier. Kingpins were always clamped in the centre and the swivel bearings at the ends, to increase the lever arm and so reduce the bearing load.|$|E
50|$|Modern cars {{do not use}} pure <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering,</b> {{partly because}} it ignores {{important}} dynamic and compliant effects, but the principle is sound for low-speed manoeuvres. Some racing cars use reverse Ackermann geometry {{to compensate for the}} large difference in slip angle between the inner and outer front tyres while cornering at high speed. The use of such geometry helps reduce tyre temperatures during high-speed cornering but compromises performance in low-speed manoeuvres.|$|E
50|$|Gerry Anderson {{would later}} {{commission}} {{the construction of}} a second, full-sized FAB 1 replica. This vehicle was a modified Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit, with the bonnet line extended to house the six-wheel drive, complemented by double <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering.</b> It did not have the bubble canopy or centre-mounted steering of the original, and apart from the pink paint job and re-trim, the passenger compartment was stock Rolls-Royce. This model attended Anderson's funeral on 13 January 2013.|$|E
50|$|Upright {{resembles a}} two-wheeled bicycle, {{traditionally}} diamond frame, or open frame, but with either two widely spaced wheels {{at the back}} (called delta) or two wheels at the front (called tadpole). The rider straddles the frame in both delta and tadpole configurations. Steering is through a handlebar directly connected to the front wheel via a conventional bicycle fork in delta, or via a form of <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> geometry {{in the case of}} the upright tadpole.|$|E
50|$|The {{steering}} linkages {{connecting the}} steering {{box and the}} wheels usually conform to a variation of <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> geometry, {{to account for the}} fact that in a turn, the inner wheel is actually travelling a path of smaller radius than the outer wheel, so that the degree of toe suitable for driving in a straight path is not suitable for turns. The angle the wheels make with the vertical plane also influences steering dynamics (see camber angle) as do the tires.|$|E
5000|$|In 1963 the Airfix slot {{car racing}} system was introduced. Airfix {{produced}} cars with front-wheel <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> and, later, conversion kits so that normal Airfix [...] kit cars {{such as the}} Ford Zodiac and the Sunbeam Rapier could be raced. The first set had Ferrari and Cooper cars and an 11-foot figure-of-eight track: it cost £4/19/11d. Always {{in the shadow of}} the Scalextric range, the Airfix version attempted to progress with the higher-end Model Road Racing Company (MRRC) range but eventually the venture was abandoned.|$|E
5000|$|Tadpole trikes tend also to use <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> geometry, {{perhaps with}} both front brakes {{operated}} by the stronger hand. While the KMX Kart stunt trike with this setup allows the rear brake to be operated separately, letting the rider do [...] "bootlegger turns", the standard setup for most trikes has the front brake for each side operated by each hand. The center-of-mass of most tadpole trikes {{is close to the}} front wheels, making the rear brake less useful. The rear brake may instead be connected to a latching brake lever for use as a parking brake when stopped on a hill.|$|E
50|$|Built by the Merryweather Fire Engine {{company in}} Greenwich, in 1888, the Butler Petrol Cycle (first {{recorded}} {{use of the}} term) was a three-wheeled petrol vehicle. The rear wheel was directly driven by a 5/8hp (466W) 600 cc (40 in3; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm}) flat twin four-stroke engine (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery), equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor (five years before Maybach), and <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering,</b> {{all of which were}} state of the art at the time. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a throttle valve lever. The driver was seated between the front wheels.|$|E
50|$|Toe {{is usually}} {{adjustable}} in production automobiles, even though caster angle and camber angle {{are often not}} adjustable. Maintenance of front end alignment, which used to involve all three adjustments, currently involves only setting the toe; in most cases, even for a car in which caster or camber are adjustable, only the toe will need adjustment. One related concept is that the proper toe for straight line travel of a vehicle will not be correct while turning, since the inside wheel must travel around a smaller radius than the outside wheel; to compensate for this, the steering linkage typically conforms more or less to <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> geometry, modified to suit {{the characteristics of the}} individual vehicle.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{approximation}} {{to perfect}} <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> geometry may be generated {{by moving the}} steering pivot points inward so as to lie on a line drawn between the steering kingpins and {{the centre of the}} rear axle. The steering pivot points are joined by a rigid bar called the tie rod which can also be part of the steering mechanism, {{in the form of a}} rack and pinion for instance. With perfect Ackermann, at any angle of steering, the centre point of all of the circles traced by all wheels will lie at a common point. Note that this may be difficult to arrange in practice with simple linkages, and designers are advised to draw or analyse their steering systems over the full range of steering angles.|$|E
5000|$|Others, {{such as the}} 70-ton Cranes trailer {{illustrated}} here {{beneath the}} Tortoise had five axles, spaced {{along the length of}} the trailer. The end-wheel designs have the advantages of better ability to cross rough ground and steering more easily. Those with axles throughout their length must have suspension that allows the axles to move and also allowing some steering. This makes them more complicated to manufacture. Placing the wheels at the ends also allows the chassis to dip down into a [...] "well", giving a lower centre of gravity during transport. The Cranes' trailer had a frame split into two sections of two and three axles, with a further carrying bed above them. The outermost four axles had <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> for their wheels.|$|E

30|$|Kinematic constraints: Since {{the mode}} of {{locomotion}} in the Scorpio is crawling, standard wheeled robot kinematics are not valid. Consequently, all recent standard local path planning algorithms which assume <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> model cannot be used [14 – 22].|$|E

30|$|The {{next stage}} {{added to the}} VFH {{algorithm}} in the VFH+ algorithm was to mask the histogram representing obstacle density to consider only directions feasible for the robot to travel in.

30|$|Recovering {{the image}} scale is {{possible}} {{when the camera}} motion is constrained to a surface. For example, in Kitt et al. (2011), image scale ambiguity was solved by using the <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> model and assuming that the vehicle drives on a planar road surface. In Nourani-Vatani and Borges (2011), the planar motion of a vehicle was estimated by using a downward-facing camera and the <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> model for estimation. Moreover, an INS system is used to obtain vehicle pitch and roll angles. To resolve the image scale variation problem, (Nourani-Vatani and Borges 2011; Gonzalez et al. 2012) regarded {{the distance between the}} downward-facing camera and the ground as almost constant because the differences in camera height were cancelled throughout the experiment as zero mean. In Scaramuzza et al. (2009), a monocular camera positioned with an offset to the vehicle rotation center was used to recover scale as the vehicle turns. However, the formulation degenerates in straight driving, and the scale is no longer recoverable. In Zhang et al. (2014), a method that does not require the imaged terrain to be flat was demonstrated. The method can simultaneously recover the inclination angle of the ground and estimate the motion. Wheel odometry deals with cases in which the detected terrain is not flat. Recently, a new approach was designed and applied by Nagatani et al. (2010). The author developed a telecentric camera by using a CCD camera and telecentric lens that maintains the same FOV regardless of the variation in camera height from the ground.|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{synthesis}} of a steering mechanism that exactly meets the requirements of <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> geometry. It starts from reviewing of the four-bar linkage, then discusses the number of points that a common four-bar linkage could precisely trace at most. After pointing out the limits of a four-bar steering mechanism, this article inves-tigates the turning geometry for steering wheels and proposes a steering mechanism with incomplete noncircular gears for vehicle by transforming the Ackermann criteria into the mechanism synthesis. The pitch curves, addendum curves, dedendum curves, tooth profiles and transition curves of the noncircular gears are formulated and designed. Kinematic simulations are executed to demonstrate the target of design...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of nature’s predators is considered for designing a high speed tracking controller for nonholonomic vehicles, whose dynamics are represented using a unicycle model. To {{ensure that the}} vehicle behaves intuitively and mimics the biologically inspired predator-prey interaction, saturation constraints based on <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> kinematics are added. A new strategy for mapping commands back into a viable envelope is introduced, and the restrictions are accounted for using Lyapunov stability criteria. Following verification of the saturation constraints, the proposed algorithm was implemented on a testing platform. Stable trajectories of up to 9 [*]m/s were achieved. The results presented show that the algorithm demonstrates significant promise in high speed trajectory tracking with obstacle avoidance...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years the number of {{applications}} of autonomous mobile robots to outdoor and off-road tasks, like border surveillance and monitoring, search and rescue, agriculture, driveless mobility has been rapidly increasing. Among the huge number of functionalities that are required to make a vehicle an autonomous robot, localisation, path planning and trajectory tracking are the most important. This paper proposes a novel approach to solve the trajectory tracking problem of an <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> vehicle. A multi-body dynamic model of the vehicle is proposed as a mean to tune and validate the tracking controller. The proposal is supported by an experimental validation, that shows the effectiveness of the trajectory tracking controller and its performance in comparison with the accuracy of the localisation algorithm...|$|E

The objective function of the optimisation comprises of steering error. The length of the steering arm has been assumed as one-fifth of the wheel track for all cases. The steering error, transmission angle and mechanical advantages of these steering mechanisms have been compared. It {{has been found that}} the rack and pinion steering mechanism produces the least steering error. The transmission angle and mechanical advantage of the centre lever steering mechanism are most favourable. A suggestion has been made to replace the existing <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism for long wheelbase vehicles by a central outrigger type leading rack and pinion steering mechanism.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} the simulation of vehicle kinematics with SimVis 3 D and the Newton Game Dynamics Engine. As running example a Pioneer 1 like robot is used. First its differential drive is simulated manually, without physical effects. Then the dynamics engine {{is applied to}} simulate this drive mechanism based on rolling friction between wheels and ground. Comparing the effort of application code for both approaches shows the benefit of delegating the calculation of rigid body motions. This fact is further stressed by simulating a trailer as a passive vehicle without any code extensions. Finally, a standard vehicle kinematic system consisting of <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> and rear wheel drive is realized 2. The paper concludes with an application of this model for simulating the drive system of a bucket excavator as real world scenario...|$|E

For this purpose, we have built a virtual golf course terrain and golf cart model in Gazebo, selected and modernized ROS-based packages {{in order to use}} them with <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> vehicle simulation. To verify our simulation and algorithms, we navigated the golf cart model from one golf hole to another within a virtual 3 D golf course. For the real world algorithms’ verification, we developed a small-size vehicle prototype based on Traxxas radio-controlled car model, which is equipped with an on-board controller and sensors. The autonomous navigation of Traxxas-based vehicle prototype has been tested in indoor environment, where it utilized sensory data about environment and vehicle states, and performed localization, optimal trajectory computation and dynamic obstacles’ recognition with adjusting the route in real time...|$|E
40|$|Vector field (otherwise {{known as}} force vector or force field) {{navigation}} {{has been used}} in mobile robotics primarily for goal oriented navigation and obstacle avoidance. At the most basic level the vector field consists of attractive forces, goals, and repulsive forces, usually objects. Both attractive and repulsive forces are usually characterised as point forces. The shortfall of this characterisation {{is that there is no}} way of controlling the heading of the mobile robot as it reaches the goal position. In this paper various methods of altering the goal vector field will be looked at. These methods include investigating clustered attractive and repulsive forces as well as introducing rotational and line based forces. This investigation was run using a simulated model of an <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> vehicle. Results indicated that a complex vector field approach was able to give position and heading control at waypoints with the chosen simulated vehicle. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an optimal state {{feedback}} control law for addressing point stabilization and tracking problems of nonholonomic vehicles with <b>Ackermann</b> <b>steering</b> in a unified manner. Unlike other feedback controllers that perform dynamic linearization of vehicle models, the proposed optimal feedback controller provides the {{state feedback control}} to the original nonlinear vehicle model for achieving excellent state-tracking performance. In addition, nonlinear control techniques suggested in the literature to date require that the desired trajectory of the robot is generated using persistently excited inputs. This may be too restrictive and non-realistic hypothesis to mimic a real scenario. Here, we address this issue by developing a smooth state-feedback control law that is formulated by modifying the classical Pontryagin's minimum principle. The proposed control law can be applied for solving control problems of a general class of nonlinear affine systems. The proposed control scheme offers a modular solution to other control techniques for {{a large number of}} mobile robot applications. The theoretical results are validated through computer simulations...|$|E
