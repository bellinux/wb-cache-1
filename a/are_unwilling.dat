5|$|For {{people who}} <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> {{or unable to}} take {{medication}} regularly, long-acting depot preparations of antipsychotics {{may be used to}} achieve control. They reduce the risk of relapse to a greater degree than oral medications. When used in combination with psychosocial interventions, they may improve long-term adherence to treatment. The American Psychiatric Association suggests considering stopping antipsychotics in some people if there are no symptoms for more than a year.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President: Politics for Ordinary Radicals is a 2008 book co-written by Evangelical authors Shane Claiborne and Chris Haw, two {{important}} figures in New Monasticism. The book {{asserts that the}} countercultural themes in the ministry of Jesus, {{such as those of}} self-denial, are ignored by American Christians because they have become accustomed to exercising Christian privilege and <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> to give it up.|$|E

50|$|HIV/AIDS stigma is {{widespread}} in South Africa: a 2002 national survey revealed that 26% of respondents <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> {{to share a}} meal with a person living with AIDS, 18% <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> {{to sleep in the}} same room as with someone with AIDS, and 6% <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> to talk to a person with AIDS. AIDS-related stigma is most severe among township residents in South Africa because they lack access to reliable information about the disease. Many South Africans in townships wrongly believe that HIV is transmitted through proximity to HIV-positive individuals, which leads them to claim that people with AIDS should be socially ostracized.|$|R
5|$|The {{expansion}} {{is set on}} a post-apocalyptic version of Mount Desert Island, known in-game as The Island, which is north-east of the Commonwealth, Fallouts post-apocalyptic version of Boston, Massachusetts. The starting point is the town of Far Harbor. The Island, where many unique creatures reside, is blanketed by radioactive fog. Because the creatures that live inside the fog <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> to go anywhere without it, the town uses devices called fog condensers to turn the fog into liquid {{in order to protect}} its inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} {{decade of the}} 21st century, the overall {{consensus}} supported the position {{that there was only}} a single author who was writing either {{at the end of the}} 4th century or the beginning of the 5th century, and who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) into the lives of the 3rd century emperors. Further, that the author used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to Cicero and Ammianus Marcellinus in a complex allegorical game. Despite these conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period and is thus continually being re-evaluated, since modern historians <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> to abandon it as a unique source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{receives}} {{news that}} his Aunt Shirley has died, and he informs the office. The only co-worker he invites {{to the funeral}} is Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), who flees when Dwight begins shooting the corpse with a shotgun to ensure it is really dead. At the funeral, Dwight's family gathers: his cousins Mose (Michael Schur) and Zeke (Matt Jones), his brother Jeb (Thomas Middleditch), his sister Fannie (Majandra Delfino), his nephew Cammy (Blake Garrett Rosenthal), and his uncle Heinrich (Tom Bower). The family learns that Aunt Shirley has willed the siblings her estate {{on the condition that}} they all come back home to run it. Despite Dwight's enthusiasm in inheriting it, Fannie and Jeb <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> to move back in {{due to the lack of}} sophistication farm life offers. Nevertheless, Dwight convinces them to help him run the farm.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{intermarriage}} continued, as many KMT soldiers married aboriginal {{women who were}} from poorer areas and could be easily bought as wives. Modern studies show {{a high degree of}} genetic intermixing. Despite this, many contemporary Taiwanese <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> to entertain the idea of having an aboriginal heritage. In a 1994 study, it was found that 71% of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an aboriginal man. For much of the KMT era the government definition of aboriginal identity had been 100% aboriginal parentage, leaving any intermarriage resulting in a non-aboriginal child. Later the policy was adjusted to the ethnic status of the father determining the status of the child.|$|E

5|$|One {{probable}} {{reason for}} the British clergy's refusal {{to cooperate with the}} Gregorian missionaries was the ongoing conflict between the natives and the Anglo-Saxons, who still were encroaching upon British lands {{at the time of the}} mission. The British <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> to preach to the invaders of their country, and the invaders saw the natives as second-class citizens, and would have <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> to listen to any conversion efforts. There was also a political dimension, as the missionaries could be seen as agents of the invaders; because Augustine was protected by Æthelberht, submitting to Augustine would have been seen as submitting to Æthelberht's authority, which the British bishops would have <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> to do.|$|R

25|$|In Europe and elsewhere, railway {{networks}} are {{considered part of}} the national transport infrastructure, just like roads, highways and waterways, so are often financed by the state. Operators of the rolling stock pay fees according to rail use. This makes possible the large investments required for the technically and, in the long-term, also economically advantageous electrification. Because railroad infrastructure is privately owned in the U.S., railroads <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> to make the necessary investments for electrification.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{after the}} fall of the USSR many critiques of {{federalism}} as an institution to resolve ethnic conflict emerged. The devolution of power away from the central state can weaken ties to the central state. Moreover, the parallel institutions created to serve a particular nation or ethnic group might provide significant resources for Secession from the central state. As most states <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> to give up an integral portion of their territory, secessionist movements may trigger violence.|$|E

25|$|It {{would require}} {{explicit}} words {{in an act}} to convince us that Congress intended to bar a trade journal, a house organ or a newspaper, published by a corporation, from expressing views on candidates or political proposals in the regular course of its publication.

25|$|Even {{among those}} reconstructionist groups who see {{themselves}} {{as part of the}} broader, Pagan or Neopagan spectrum, or who simply see some members of the Pagan community as allies, there is still a refusal to accept or identify with {{what they see as the}} more problematic aspects of that community, such as the above-noted eclecticism, cultural appropriation or Wiccan-inspired ritual structures. Many Polytheistic Reconstructionists see Reconstructionism as the older current in the Pagan community, and <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> to give up this part of their history simply because eclectic movements are currently more fashionable.|$|E
