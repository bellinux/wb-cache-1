In {{this paper}} we provide {{experimental}} results concerning {{the impact of}} the negotiation protocol onto the quality of the negotiation outcome as well as onto the communication complexity of interactions incurred during negotiations. We evaluate experimentally three negotiation protocols (Direct Task <b>Assignment,</b> <b>Contract</b> Net and Iterated Contract Net) with respect to two performance measures: negotiation outcome (i. e. utility) and communication complexity (i. e. number of messages transferred), by assigning different busy profiles to the contractors. We find that the Direct Task Assignment delivers the worst average outcome, {{but at the same time}} it uses the lowest number of messages. The Contract Net and Iterated Contract Net deliver much higher utility on average, but the Iterated Contract Net obtains the highest outcome for some configurations at the cost of the highest number of messages. ...|$|E

Credit granted to a person keeps the legal frame andfeatures only if a bank or nonbanking financial institution {{is part of the}} credit agreement, facing, from this perspective,a legal monopoly, the need to regulate lending itself being obvious for stability financial system. To circumventprudential regulations, banks practice the assignment of debts, assignee being a company established as having themajority shareholder (or sole) shareholder the bank-assignor. This situation, {{in the absence of the}} expressauthorization of the National Bank of Romania, makes the <b>assignment</b> <b>contract</b> violate the conditions of specialized useability. In these conditions, the operation itself, done by fraud law, is void. The aims of the presented study bring to theconclusion that only the companies which are authorized by the National Bank to run credit operation have the judicialcapacity to take over, by assignment, banking credits, any other solution being equivalent to recognize the right of eachentity (why not of any individual) to develop credit operations specific to banks, in any conditions, by establishing anykind of accessories...|$|E

This article {{examines}} whether C can insist {{the extinction of}} B"s claim, seized or belonging to insolvency estate, against garnishment creditor or trustee in bankruptcy, when ? A had claim against B, and B had claim against C, ? A, B, C made an arrangement(tripartite set-off contract) which stipulates that A"s claim and B"s claim are extinguished {{to the extent of}} the same amount, subject to contract terms, ? after such agreement, third party creditor(B"s creditor) seized B"s claim or B went into bankruptcy and ? after the seizure or commencement of insolvency procedure, contract terms were fulfilled. We can say this matter as the external effect of tripartite set-off contract. The main conclusions are as follows. If we can characterize tripartite set-off contract as ? <b>assignment</b> <b>contract</b> about A"s claim(which satisfies requirements for setting up assignment against the third party) or ? joint surety contract that C stands joint surety to A, C can insist the extinction of B"s claim. The ordinary tripartite contract about direct payment, which stipulates that A & B"s each claim is extinguished when C pays the same amount to A directly, can be classified as tripartite set-off contract in a broad sense. Because we can characterize tripartite contract about direct payment as joint surety & joint creditor contract that C stands joint surety to A, and B & A are joint creditors to C, C can also insist the extinction of B"s claim against the third party creditor. However, under the present security system about receivables, it is problematic to admit C"s refusal right of payment against garnishment creditor before the extinction of B"s claim, on the basis of tripartite contract about direct payment. It is more desirable to admit such refusal right, when A, B, C came to an agreement about pledge on the claim with requirements for setting up pledge against the third party. ? ??? 2014 ? ????? ????? ???? ?????(HY- 2014 -G) ...|$|E

40|$|In this Masterâ€™s Thesis a new Distributed Award Protocol (DAP) for robot {{communication}} and cooperation is presented. Task <b>assignment</b> (<b>contract</b> awarding) is done dynamically with contracts assigned to robots {{based upon the}} best bid received. Instead of having a manager and a contractor it is proposed a fully distributed bidding/awarding mechanism without a distinguished master. The best bidding robots are awarded with contract for execution. The contractors make decisions locally. This brings the following benefits: no communication bottleneck, low computational power requirement, increased robustness. DAP can handle multitasking. Tasks can be injected into system during the execution of already allocated tasks. As tasks have priorities, in the next cycle after taking into account actual bid parameters of all robots, tasks can be re-allocated. The aim is to minimize a global cost function which is a compromise between cost of task execution and cost of resources usage. Information about tasks and bid values is spread among robots {{with the use of}} a Round Robin Route, which is a novel solution proposed in this work. This method allows also identifying failed robots. Such failed robot is eliminated from the list of awarded robots and its replacement is found so the task is still executed by a team. If the failure of a robot was temporary (e. g. communication noise) and the robot can recover, it can again participate in the next bidding/awarding process. Using a bidding/awarding mechanism allows robots to dynamically relocate among tasks. This is also contributes to system robustness. DAP was evaluated through multiple experiments done in the multi-robot simulation system. Various scenarios were tested to check the idea of the main algorithm. Different failures of robots (communication failures, partial hardware malfunctions) were simulated and observations were made regarding how DAP recovers from them. Also the DAP flexibility to environment changes was watched. The experiments in the simulated environment confirmed the above features of DAP...|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} issues, {{related to}} third-party {{involvement in a}} contractual relationship, are examined. The first two (assignment of contractual rights/delegation of contractual duties and third-party beneficiary contracts) are examined in a unified way. After pointing to the striking similarity between beneficiary and <b>assignment</b> <b>contracts,</b> we discuss the non-simultaneous assent argument, the danger of creating open classes of beneficiaries without {{the intention of the}} contracting parties, and other problems. In a second part, we deal with the controversial issue of efficient breach due to inducement by a third party.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the legal {{institution}} of <b>assignment</b> of <b>contract</b> from comparative point of view. The core of <b>contract</b> <b>assignment</b> lies in the replacement of a contractual party by a third person during {{the existence of a}} contractual relationship. As a new institution in Czech civil law introduced by the Civil Code as of 1. January 2014, the topic has not been sufficiently covered in legal theory and therefore its academic elaboration is highly actual. Before the 1 January 2014, the <b>assignment</b> of <b>contract</b> was not expressly recognised by the Civil Code 1964 or the Commercial Code, however the practice often pointed out the lack of legal regulation and looked for other ways to achieve the replacement of the contractual party. The goal of this thesis is to identify the diversities between the chosen legal regulations and to provide an evaluation of the Czech regulation based on comparison with foreign approaches. Comparison with the Italian civil law concept of cessione del contratto was chosen because of its major influence on other European codifications of contract law including the Civil Code 2012. Other regulations, such as the Civil Code of Netherlands, European Contract Code, Principles of European Contract Law, Draft Common Frame of Reference or UNIDROIT Principles of International [...] ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Assignment</b> of <b>Contract</b> The {{purpose of}} this master's thesis is to analyze the {{assignability}} of contracts under Czech law {{in the light of}} comparative, historical and theoretical aspects of this phenomenon. Relevance of this subject matter was recently highlighted by adoption of the new Czech Civil Code, which expressly authorizes this operation but leaves important issues open to interpretation. The thesis is composed of an introduction, two main parts and a conclusion. First two chapters of the first part deal with historical development of this legal concept. In the roman law, a contractual obligation was conceived as a "bond of law" (iuris vinculum), which implied a strictly personal nature of this relationship. However, this view started to change as soon as the roman economy shifted from agriculture towards trade and business, resulting in assignability of a contractual right. In the codification era of the 19 th century, the concept of a delegation of contractual duty came in, establishing a theoretical foundation for the <b>assignment</b> of <b>contract</b> as such. The third chapter moves our attention to the modern times, focusing primarily on the assignement of contract in various European countries, United States and Japan. The emphasis is put on the theoretical discussions this legal concept has seen in [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We {{argue that}} the {{emergence}} of a well-developed market for patented technologies over {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries facilitated {{the emergence of a}} group of highly specialized and productive inventors by making it possible for them to transfer to others responsibility for developing and commercializing their inventions. The most basic of the institutional supports that made this market possible was, of course, the patent system, which created secure and tradable property rights in invention. But trade was also facilitated by the emergence of intermediaries who economized on the information costs associated with assessing the value of inventions and helped to match sellers and buyers of patent rights. Patent agents and lawyers were particularly well placed to provide these kinds of services, because they were linked to similar attorneys in other parts of the country and because, in the course of their regular business activities, they accumulated information about participants on both sides of the market for technology. Our quantitative analysis of <b>assignment</b> <b>contracts</b> demonstrates that patentees whose assignments were handled by these specialists produced more patents over their careers, assigned a greater fraction of their patents, and also were able to find buyers for their inventions much more quickly than other patentees. In other words, the development of institutions supporting market trade in patented technology seems to have made it possible for creative individuals to specialize more fully in inventive work [...] that is, it seems to have set in motion the kind of Smithian processes that have generally been associated with higher rates of productivity growth. ...|$|R

We then consider topics more often discussed in human resource management and organization theory than in labor economics: politics, social relations, and work practices.
