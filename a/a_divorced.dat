40|$|Seznam literatury - 60 - LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF <b>A</b> <b>DIVORCE</b> IN PROPERTY AREA Summary Subject of {{my thesis}} is "Legal {{consequences}} of <b>a</b> <b>divorce</b> in property area". In the first chapters of this thesis I dealt {{in particular with}} the common property of spouses. I briefly described what belongs and what {{does not belong to}} the common property. Then I dealt with <b>a</b> <b>divorce</b> and its basic forms which are the so called divorce including identification of cause for breakdown of marriage, complicated divorce and divorce without identifying cause of breakdown of marriage. I focused mainly on the last mentioned form of <b>a</b> <b>divorce</b> which is often also called as <b>a</b> <b>divorce</b> based on agreement. This form of <b>a</b> <b>divorce</b> assumes that spouses are able {{to communicate with each other}} and that they are prepared and able to fulfill all the conditions required by law. <b>A</b> <b>divorce</b> based on <b>an</b> agreement of both spouses simplifies the divorce proceedings. The most important legal consequence of <b>a</b> <b>divorce</b> in property area is forfeiture of common property and property settlement. Common property settlement may be reached upon an agreement, by a court decision or upon a legal presumption. Similarly to <b>a</b> <b>divorce</b> the most simple way how to settle extinguished common property is an agreement made and signed by spouses who are able to agree on solution [...] ...|$|R

Eleanor Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook expressed skepticism that this had been a serious obstacle, noting the depth of Mercer's feelings.

According to Vandever, she entered a house of prostitution at Paducah, Kentucky and so, in October 1865, Vandever applied for <b>a</b> <b>divorce</b> on the grounds of adultery rather than simple desertion. The divorce decree was granted in April 1866. So although Mrs. Creede had not sought <b>a</b> <b>divorce</b> from Vandever before marrying Creede, Vandever {{had obtained}} <b>a</b> <b>divorce</b> before Nancy Vandever's marriage to Creede.|$|R

Tightrope {{was a critical}} and commercial hit and became the fourth highest-grossing R-rated film of 1984. Eastwood next starred in the crime comedy City Heat (1984) alongside Burt Reynolds, a film about a private eye and his partner who get mixed up with gangsters in the prohibition era of the 1930s.

5|$|Edward became king on his father's {{death in}} early 1936. However, he showed impatience with court protocol, and caused concern among {{politicians}} by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions. Only months into his reign, he caused a constitutional crisis by proposing marriage to Wallis Simpson, an American who had divorced {{her first husband}} and was seeking a divorce from her second. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing that <b>a</b> <b>divorced</b> woman with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective queen consort. Additionally, such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward's status as the titular head of the Church of England, {{which at the time}} disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a former spouse was still alive. Edward knew that the British government, led by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have forced a general election and would ruin his status as a politically neutral constitutional monarch. When it became apparent that he could not marry Wallis and remain on the throne, Edward abdicated. He was succeeded by his younger brother, George VI. With a reign of 326 days, Edward is one of the shortest-reigning monarchs in British history.|$|E
5|$|Minority Report also {{continues}} Spielberg's {{tradition of}} depicting broken families.*Vest. pg. 136 In Dick's short story, Anderton is a childless, married man whose main motives are self-preservation and preventing the disassembly of the PreCrime division. While {{he is also}} trying to save himself in the movie, his greater concern is uncovering the story behind his son's disappearance. Spielberg would later transform his next science fiction film, War of the Worlds, from a story about a single man to one about <b>a</b> <b>divorced</b> father concerned with protecting his children. Buckland notes that the two tragic parent-child relationships in the picture (Agatha and Ann Lively, John and Sean Anderton) have a common element. The movie has four shots of them submerged in water. Agatha's face is shown in a close up shot, taken from directly above her, when she is submerged in her photon milk, nutrient bath. When photos of her mother's submerged corpse are shown to her, the emphasized photograph is a similar image of her face taken from directly above. Anderton and his son are shown together in a pool flashback scene in which they have a contest to see who can hold their breath longest. John is underwater when his son is taken, and later in the apartment he is shown lying motionless, immersed in a filled bathtub, in a manner Buckland finds similar to the shots of Agatha and Ann. Buckland notes that co-screenwriter Frank introduced the water theme, as he wrote Agatha and her mother's back stories while adding the bathtub scene.|$|E
