50|$|In 1939 Hans Gaffron {{observed}} that the algae he was studying, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (a green-algae), would sometimes switch from the production of oxygen {{to the production of}} hydrogen. He never discovered the cause of this change and for many years other scientists failed in their attempts to discover it. In the late 1990s, Anastasios Melis discovered that if the <b>algae</b> <b>culture</b> medium is deprived of sulfur it will switch from the production of oxygen (normal photosynthesis), to the production of hydrogen. He found that the enzyme responsible for this reaction is hydrogenase, but that the hydrogenase lost this function in the presence of oxygen. Melis found that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted its internal oxygen flow, allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react, causing the algae to produce hydrogen. Chlamydomonas moewusii is also a good strain for the production of hydrogen.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in large-scale production of biomass is the susceptibility to infections, especially when the growth medium is poor in nutrients- enabling the growth of various fungi and foreign algae. Indeed, one {{of the main}} pests which can cause the collapse of the Haematococcus Pluvialis culture is a fungus. In Prof. Boussiba’s lab this fungus has been researched and isolated and defined as a new species (Paraphyzoderma Sedebokerensis). This fungi is a specific parasite for Haematococci cells. Following its cultivation under sterile conditions, its life cycle was defined and its mode of infection was studied. Results showed that there are special proteins (lectins) present on the zeospheres of the fungi which recognize specific sugar moieties upon the algal cell wall. The infection process begins with the interaction between the lectins and the sugar moieties, and can end {{with the collapse of the}} <b>algae</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E

Science News Letter praised the optimistic results in an article entitled [...] "Algae to Feed the Starving".

[...] The cover of the magazine also featured Arthur D. Little's Cambridge laboratory, which was a supposed future food factory. A few years later, the magazine published an article entitled [...] "Tomorrow's Dinner", which stated, [...] "There is no doubt in the mind of scientists that the farms of the future will actually be factories." [...] Science Digest also reported, [...] "common pond scum would soon become the world's most important agricultural crop."

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of experiments to determine the influence of selected physico-chemical factors - oxygen, visible light and temperature - on the decomposition of (1) chlorophylls a, b and c, chlorophyll a derivatives and beta-carotene in acetone solution, and (2) chlorophyll a and beta-carotene in axenic cultures of the blue-green algae Anabaena variabilis. The results indicate that both in acetone extracts and in blue-green <b>algae</b> <b>cultures</b> these pigments were most sensitive to light and oxygen; temperatures of up to 25 o C had no marked influence on these compounds. Under anoxia in acetone solution, the stability towards light decreased in the order chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, chlorophylls c.

40|$|Algae {{presents}} {{itself as a}} versatile feedstock {{for the production of}} fuels and chemicals ranging from omega- 3 fatty acids to Jet-A or JP- 8 jet fuels. Mixing of <b>algae</b> <b>culture</b> systems is vital to creating this feedstock. A review of mixing details the many <b>algae</b> <b>culture</b> systems employed to produce algae biomass. It also explores the many mixing methods utilized within the culture system and the importance for the design of these mixing methods. This importance of design has led many researchers to develop mathematical approaches to determining mixing characteristics of <b>algae</b> <b>culture</b> systems. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) uses mathematical techniques to characterize fluid dynamics with the ability to designate thousands of equations to be solved by a computer processor. CFD is known for its strength in design and simulation. This technique allows a user to model a system of fluids to predict movement and therefore effectiveness of design while bypassing physical construction. Studies into this technique are presented and express the strength of CFD as a single phase solver and the current challenges of using CFD as a multiphase solver. To complete an understanding of turbulent mixing effects on algae growth performance, multiphase flows were investigated using a measurement technique of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). PIV was used to measure the liquid phase fluid characteristics of a Flat Panel Bioreactor (FPB) that was undergoing mixing by steady state aeration. Parameters such as flow rate (Q), mean velocity (v), and mean Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) were characterized for each experiment that was tested across different aeration schemes. These parameters were weighted against each other {{to come up with a}} quality of mixing term, San (M), which was able to predict the ranking of algae growth performance amongst each experiment. As multiphase flows and their consequent effects on microalgae growth performance are further understood, techniques of CFD may be able to simulate and predict effectiveness solely using computing tools...|$|E
