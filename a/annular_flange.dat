50|$|A {{skateboard}} {{having one}} or more truck assemblies configured to eliminate undesired ride characteristics such as hanger-jiggle and wheel bite, without sacrificing the skateboard's steering responsiveness. Each truck assembly includes an axle assembly with a ring-shaped hanger that is confined on a kingpin using a pair of bushings, {{at least one of}} which includes an <b>annular</b> <b>flange</b> that projects into an annular gap defined between the hanger and the kingpin. This prevents the hanger from moving laterally relative to the kingpin and thereby eliminates undesired ride characteristics such as hanger-jiggle and wheel bite. In a separate feature of the invention, the skateboard truck assembly further incorporates a low-friction slider plate that enhances the rider's performance of certain maneuvers {{and at the same time}} protects other components of the truck assembly from undue wear.|$|E

40|$|A {{pressure}} vessel includes a ported fitting having an <b>annular</b> <b>flange</b> formed on an end thereof and a tank that envelopes the <b>annular</b> <b>flange.</b> A crack arresting barrier is bonded to and forming a {{lining of the}} tank within the outer surface thereof. The crack arresting barrier includes a cured resin having a post-curing ductility rating of at least approximately 60 % through the cured resin, and further includes randomly-oriented fibers positioned in and throughout the cured resin...|$|E
40|$|Celestite/barite−replaced and phosphate−replicated {{tubes of}} Early Cambrian anabaritids from the {{northern}} part of the Si− berian Platform (Anabar Shield) give new evidence on the wall−structure of these enigmatic fossils. The walls consist of fibres, interpreted as reflecting an original aragonitic fabric. Bundles of fibres are arranged in growth lamellae, and the latter form an angle of at least 45 ° with the inner tube wall. Where the outer tube surface projects into <b>annular</b> <b>flanges,</b> the lamellae have a chevron−like section due to the backwards deflection of the outer parts. Anabaritids are usually referred to the Cnidaria or left without systematic assignment, but earlier suggestions included affinity to the serpulid polychaetes. The chevron structure resembles that previously exclusively known from serpulids, but the presence of internal tooth−like structures in anabaritid tubes, perhaps compromising up−and−down movement through the tubes, continue to make a di− rect assignment to the Serpulida questionable...|$|R
40|$|A {{mounting}} assembly includes an <b>annular</b> supporting <b>flange</b> disposed coaxially about a centerline axis {{which has a}} plurality of circumferentially spaced apart supporting holes therethrough. An annular liner is disposed coaxially with the supporting flange and includes a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart mounting holes aligned with respective ones of the supporting holes. Each of a plurality of mounting pins includes a proximal end fixedly joined to the supporting flange through a respective one of the supporting holes, and a distal end disposed through a respective one of the liner mounting holes for supporting the liner to the supporting flange while unrestrained differential thermal movement of the liner relative to the supporting flange...|$|R
40|$|A second mylar head {{is easily}} {{fashioned}} into a horizontal <b>annular</b> <b>flange,</b> {{inspired by the}} Bacon and Dobson tone rings. Its effect is dramatic, suppressing the “ping” associated with the attack sound of metal picks on metal strings on taut mylar heads but leaving most other features unscathed. The flange itself takes only minutes to make. An old or previously torn head can be used. It is installed directly under the regular head, without any further modifications, and, so, can be removed with no harm done...|$|E
