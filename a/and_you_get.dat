25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E

Songs in the key of B-movie, with faux-horror lyrics and hook-laden riffs that work surprisingly well for their simplicity." [...] Sweden-based English-language site Global Domination gave an enthusiastically positive review, commenting: [...] "Because damn people, this album {{is so great that}} I fucking implore you to get both the album AND the DVD." ...|$|E
500|$|Through {{the final}} storyline of the film, set in 2012, Kohli wanted to {{demonstrate}} a modern romance, which mostly happens through SMS, instant messaging apps, and Internet chat. Kohli described it by saying, [...] "Today people flirt, communicate and connect through smses <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> that feeling of being with somebody even when you are not with that person because that person is telling you everything that is happening in their life. You are constantly updating the other person with your thoughts {{and that is what}} keeps you connected to that person." ...|$|E

He's a perfect doll to dress because he'll try on anything." [...] Eyrich sets out to dress Kurt with tailored pieces that [...] "exude his quietly flashy dapper dandyism", mindful that as the son of a car mechanic, [...] "he doesn't have a lot of money".|$|E

Bullock described Goliath as, [...] "not only the park’s best roller coaster, but arguably the best coaster in the South East (south of Virginia)." [...] Mike Collins from Coaster Radio particularly enjoyed the section of the roller coaster that takes riders outside of the park boundaries. He also said that, [...] " [...] a fun and fast coaster. It’s all about the airtime... <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a lot of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{the season}} 3 finale was {{scheduled}} to be just an hour long, executive producer Jeff Pinkner confirmed that the last three episodes would be [...] "linked in one continuous story arc". This was a reflection of Pinkner and fellow executive producer J.H. Wyman's intent to have the last three episodes of every season seem like [...] "you're turning the last page of a chapter in a novel. And usually in a good novel, the last pages [...] compels you forward with a new understanding of what the subject matter is <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> deeper and you can’t wait to turn that page."

500|$|Lou Reed, {{who wrote}} the {{majority}} of the album's lyrics, never intended to write about such topics for shock value. Reed, a fan of poets and authors such as Raymond Chandler, Nelson Algren, William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and Hubert Selby, Jr., saw no reason the content in their works couldn't translate well to rock and roll music. An English major who studied for a B.A. at Syracuse University, Reed {{said in an interview that}} he thought joining the two (gritty subject matter and music) was [...] "obvious". [...] "That's the kind of stuff you might read. Why wouldn't you listen to it? You have the fun of reading that, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the fun of rock on top of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Randle {{described}} the feeling {{after the game}} as, [...] "It's like driving down a street and getting every green light {{for the next ten}} miles, and you're just cruising along, and it's just smooth. And all of a sudden, you're getting there, you're almost there, and all of a sudden, the fucking light turns red, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> sideswiped." [...] Randle further laments the loss due to the background of many of his teammates, whom he described as [...] "misfits, guys who just got their second chance." [...] Beyond Moss's legal troubles, Carter had been released by the Philadelphia Eagles early in his career for substance abuse issues, and Cunningham was released by the Eagles and remained unsigned to a team two seasons prior. Randle himself was considered undersized coming out of college and was not heavily pursued by NFL teams.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by co-executive {{producers}} Monica Owusu-Breen and Alison Schapker, while being directed by cinematographer Thomas Yatsko. [...] "The Last Sam Weiss" [...] was the second-to-last {{episode of the}} season. Though the season 3 finale {{was scheduled to be}} just an hour long, executive producer Jeff Pinkner confirmed that the last three episodes would be [...] "linked in one continuous story arc".

500|$|To avoid {{confusion}} with Larter and Carter, Cook {{was required to}} dye her hair brown for the role. [...] "I like being a chameleon. It opens you up for so much more in this work. You don't get typecast," [...] Cook professed. Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly's relationship. [...] "It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn’t want to go there, I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn’t want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, {{is a little bit}} of chemistry <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the idea that through tragedy something good will come. So it ends in an optimistic way, that maybe they can be together but there’s no real love story," [...] Landes articulated.|$|E
500|$|On {{references}} to the larger MCU, Ramirez said [...] "those little Easter eggs that come along the way are fun", but {{there were times when}} the writers did not take opportunities to reference the rest of the universe because they felt like distractions from the series' narrative and characters. Petrie stated that the writers wanted to [...] "keep it in Hell's Kitchen" [...] and focus on issues such as [...] "the air conditioner doesn’t work at Nelson and Murdock. That’s really what we’re interested in." [...] He explained that the real life New York City [...] "has a larger than life presence" [...] with celebrities that live there—"If you see Derek Jeter walking down the street, that’s great, but then you turn the corner <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into an argument with the guy who overcharged you for a pretzel. We want our guys to be real New Yorkers." ...|$|E
500|$|GamePro did {{not find}} the game worthy of its name, {{although}} the cutscenes were praised, stating, [...] "The cinemas {{at the opening of}} the game and between each level are stunning; however, the game graphics, particularly buildings and enemies, are lackluster at best. The sound effects are bland, and there are no weapon power-ups to be found. Put that all together <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a very generic game." [...] Next Generation criticized the game for being tedious, but recognized that it is still an enjoyable game. Computer and Video Games offered similar criticism, declaring that [...] "it was too repetitive to become anything more than a good game." [...] Edge criticized the gameplay features such as camera control and boss difficulty. Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewers criticized the game for its easy bosses and its repetitive and short gameplay value. Famitsu liked the battles but complained about the Fuchikoma attaching to walls when not intended.|$|E

500|$|Christman {{contacted}} the Scientology critics based in Clearwater, and arranged flight transportation to Florida. She {{arrived at the}} airport in California to find that her flight was cancelled. Her former supervisor, Janet Weiland, was waiting for her close to the ticket counter, and tried to convince her to remain in the organization. Christman eventually got on a flight to Tampa, Florida, but was met at the gate when she arrived by agents of Scientology. Tampa police were notified, and escorted Christman safely away from the Scientologists. While a member of Scientology, Christman had given over $1 million to the organization; she used her inheritance money to pay for coursework. She commented to the St. Petersburg Times of Florida about the thought process she underwent after leaving the organization, [...] "When you get out <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the whole thing, you're like, 'What was I thinking?'. I know the people inside are brainwashed and they're laughing at me. But to me, the truth is, I'm free. I can do what I want. I can say what I want." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the suits were designed using ZBrush. A scan of an actor's body was taken, which was then encased to decipher the fabric, {{the location of the}} foam, amongst other concerns. With a computer numerical cutting of dense foam, a small scale output would be created to perfect fine details before initiating construction of the suit. Upon downloading the participant's body scan, the illustrations were overlaid to provide an output manufacturing element. Describing the computer numerical cutting process, Chris Lavery of Clothes on Film noted that it had a tendency to elicit bubbles and striations. Clark stated: [...] "The [...] suit is all made of a hexagon mesh which we also printed and made the fabric from 3D files. This would go onto the hard form; it would go inside the mould which was silicon matrix. We would put those together and then inject foam into the negative space. The wiring harness is embedded into the mould <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a torso. We then paint it and that’s your finished suit." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{standard}} {{version of the}} album contains ten tracks and the deluxe edition adds three acoustic versions as bonus tracks. Editions of the album sold at Walmart stores in North America feature a censored version of [...] "The Devil Beneath My Feet". Manson later criticized the store and its gun sales policy, categorizing Walmart in an Australian interview as [...] "that store in America which sells guns to kids but won't sell R-rated lyrics." [...] Manson went on to joke that he might [...] "do a signing at a Walmart store where I just sign guns, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a free record with it {{when you buy a}} gun." [...] American CD versions of the album were packaged with black polycarbonate discs identical to those used by Sony for the original PlayStation in the early 1990s; the discs were sourced by Brian Schuman of Concord Music from the same plant Sony used. A heat-sensitive thermal texture was added to the CD, so that it appeared black when first opened but revealed a white pattern when exposed to the heat from a CD player.|$|E
