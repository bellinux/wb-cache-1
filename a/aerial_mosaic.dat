40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robotic team suited for bottom sediment sampling and retrieval in mudflats, targeting environmental monitoring tasks. The robotic team encompasses a four-wheel-steering ground vehicle, {{equipped with a}} drilling tool designed {{to be able to}} retain wet soil, and a multi-rotor aerial vehicle for dynamic aerial imagery acquisition. On-demand aerial imagery, properly fused on an <b>aerial</b> <b>mosaic,</b> is used by remote human operators for specifying the robotic mission and supervising its execution. This is crucial for the success of an environmental monitoring study, as often it depends on human expertise to ensure the statistical significance and accuracy of the sampling procedures. Although the literature is rich on environmental monitoring sampling procedures, in mudflats, there is a gap as regards including robotic elements. This paper closes this gap by also proposing a preliminary experimental protocol tailored to exploit the capabilities offered by the robotic system. Field trials in the south bank of the river Tagus’ estuary show the ability of the robotic system to successfully extract and transport bottom sediment samples for offline analysis. The results also show the efficiency of the extraction and the benefits when compared to (conventional) human-based sampling...|$|E

Unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with a single camera offer the possibility to solve this task with moderate efforts. Unfortunately, the accumulation of tracking errors leads to a drift in the alignment of images which has to be compensated by loop closing for instance. We propose a novel approach for constructing large, consistent and undistorted mosaics by aligning video images of planar scenes. The approach allows the simultaneous closing of multiple loops possibly resulting from the camera path in a batch process. The choice of the adjustment model leads to statistical rigorous solutions while the used minimal representations for the involved homographies and the exploitation of the natural image order enable very efficient computations. The approach will be empirically evaluated with the help of synthetic data and its feasibility will be demonstrated with real data sets...|$|R

40|$|In 1991 a need arose to {{establish}} land use changes, {{which took place}} in Machakos District, Kenya during the past five decades. The study, among others, included environmental, population, conservation, farming systems, and production changes and trends. A GIS was designed mainly {{to assess the impact of}} land terracing on the reduction of soil erosion and agriculture productivity. The available material was aerial photographs dated 1948, 1960, 1978 of varying scales and qualities. Selected sites at different locations were identified, and map bases were established from available topographic maps. Stereoscopic interpretation of the aerial photographs covering the selected areas was conducted to delineate the boundaries of the chosen land categories. A set of three temporal uncontrolled <b>aerial</b> <b>mosaics</b> for each area was assembled, one from the interpreted aerial photographs of each date. A half-tone negative was produced for each mosaic. The negative was re-projected to form positive transparency of appropriate scale conforming with the map base. The areas of the various categories were measured and the temporal changes in land use were defined by comparing transparencies of different epoch. By this method it was possible to obtain quick information with reasonable accuracy and cost to meet the set objectives. The exercise had clearly demonstrated that, in the absence of recent computer technologies, it was still possible to use the available material and facilities to produce and provide useful information to satisfactorily meet certain objectives. However, for sustainable development, there should be awareness of the direction of the development in the country, and identification of the suitable technologies to meet its needs. It is, therefore, recommended to acquire suitable computer based GIS paralleled with appropriate training and follow up.

The new PX (Polynomial in alongshore X) and PXT (Polynomial in X and Time) shoreline change rate methods are applied to calculate shoreline change rates from the time series of historical shoreline positions. These new methods utilize all historical shoreline data from a beach to calculate shoreline change rates and can find acceleration in the shoreline change rate with time. The methods are shown here and in previous works to produce more parsimonious models and more statistically significant and defensible rates than the previously used ST (Single-Transect) shoreline change rate calculation method. The ability to model acceleration in shoreline change rates with time provides insight into shoreline change processes, which was previously theoretical or observed in only small-scale studies.

Specific objectives of this study were: (1) classification of plant communities on the fringes of the sagebrush steppes and the salt desert of southeastern Oregon, (2) development of symbolic and descriptive legends for the classification units, and (3) preparation of a dichotomous key to the legend. Major landform stratification was done on an <b>aerial</b> photo <b>mosaic</b> to aid the selection of sampling areas. Sampling was done by ocular survey of entire stands with the aid of pretyped aerial photography. Society tables were used for a phytosociological synthesis of the data. Fifty-six important plant communities were identified and characterized. The synthesized data were used in preparation of a descriptive legend and the dichotomous key. This narrative legend includes a brief description of each community and a summary of its associated environmental characteristics. A symbolic legend was devised to identify each of these communities. The legend identifiers consist of a hierarchically arranged, three-digit, non-connotative symbol. A field test was made indicating that the legend and key could be accurately used in the project area. In the test, 97 percent of the keyed determinations and legend units fit the newly examined stands with negligible difference between two observers. The legend and key are designed for use with aerial photo interpretation to provide a resource analysis of increased accuracy at reasonable cost.

40|$|There {{are growing}} demands for {{detailed}} and accurate land cover maps in land system research and planning. Macro-scale land cover maps normally cannot satisfy {{the studies that}} require detailed land cover maps at micro scales. In the meantime, applying conventional pixel-based classification methods in classifying high-resolution aerial imagery is ineffective to develop high accuracy land-cover maps, especially in spectrally heterogeneous and complicated urban areas. Here we present an object-based approach that identifies land-cover types from 1 -meter resolution aerial orthophotography and a 5 -foot DEM. Our study area is Tippecanoe County in the State of Indiana, USA, which covers about a 1300 km 2 land area. We used a countywide <b>aerial</b> photo <b>mosaic</b> and normalized digital elevation model as input datasets in this study. We utilized simple algorithms to minimize computation time while maintaining relatively high accuracy in land cover mapping at a county scale. The aerial photograph was pre-processed using principal component transformation to reduce its spectral dimensionality. Vegetation and non-vegetation were separated via masks determined by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. A combination of segmentation algorithms with lower calculation intensity was used to generate image objects that fulfill the characteristics selection requirements. A hierarchical image object network was formed based on the segmentation results and used to assist the image object delineation at different spatial scales. Finally, expert knowledge regarding spectral, contextual, and geometrical aspects was employed in image object identification. The resultant land cover map developed with this object-based image analysis has more information classes and higher accuracy than that derived with pixel-based classification methods...|$|R

This includes: °the realignment and upgrade of University Drive leading towards the new Hospital site between CSIRO Davies Laboratory and James Cook University, including the construction of exit and entry ramps; °realignment and upgrade {{of some of the}} existing Angus Smith Drive where University Drive will merge to it,; °road construction approximately parallel with the unsealed section of Angus Smith Drive leading from the University entrance towards the Townsville City Council Water Treatment Plant, °major bridge construction over the Ross River, including the construction of exit and entry ramps, and road realignment and widening of Upper Ross River Road. The arterial road (refer to Maunsell McIntyre Pty. Ltd. <b>aerial</b> photo <b>mosaic)</b> will serve initially as an access route to south-western Townsville from the Upper Ross and eventually as a Townsville by-pass route via Hervey's Range Road. In order to meet the requirements of the Review of Environmental Factors(REF) it is vital to identify, describe and assess the environmental advantages, disadvantages and constraints associated with the proposed route. To provide the basis for this assessment, the Australian Centre for Tropical Freshwater Research (ACTFR) was commissioned by Maunsell McIntyre Pty. Ltd. to assess the environmental values of the site with regard to potential impacts of the proposal. An ACTFR aquatic chemist and ecologist conducted a field survey of the site on June 22, 1999. During this site visit, the proposed route was traversed and an assessment of the site made to document and evaluate the structure and floristic composition of the vegetation, provide an assessment of significance of habitats for fauna and determine the environmental value of water courses crossed by the proposed route. This report forms the basis of the REF for issues pertaining to flora, fauna and water quality. A REF is intended solely to provide a preliminary assessment of the possible environmental effects of a proposed project to enable a decision to be made as to whether further and more detailed particulars are required prior to commencement of works...|$|R

Only few systems have been tested on large crowds of several hundred people and no known counting system has been tested on crowds of several thousand people. Furthermore, none of these large scale systems delivers people's positions, they just estimate the number. But having the position of people would be a large benefit, since this would enable a human observer {{to carry out a}} plausibility check. In addition, most approaches require video data as input or a scene model. In order to generally solve the problem, these assumptions must not be made.

No assumptions about crowd density will be made, i. e. the system has to work from low to very high density. The main challenge is the large variety of possible input data.

This includes the determination of their positions and the total number. In order to cope with the given challenges we divide our system into three steps: foreground segmentation, person size determination and person detection.

40|$|Mediterranean {{areas in}} Europe {{are subject to}} human induced changes. In Mediterranean France, land {{abandonment}} is the most widespread change, caused {{by a variety of}} reasons among which technological developments and social and economic changes. The land abandonment process had several unfavourable consequences for biodiversity, soil erosion and fire risks. 	To formalize our knowledge of the land abandonment process and to analyze, understand and predict the land abandonment process and its consequences, land cover change models are valuable tools. Validation of such models is essential. In many semi-natural areas the only source of continuous spatial and temporal validation data are various types of remote sensing data. Therefore, this research aims at developing a land cover change model of semi-natural Mediterranean vegetation communities that integrates with remote sensing observations for validation purposes. Therefore I first focus on the optimization of the detection of Mediterranean vegetation communities by remote sensing in time and in space using more traditional image analysis methods and using newly developed innovative information extraction approaches. Second, I constrain the land cover change model to the level of detail that can be obtained from the remote sensing data. 	A Mediterranean ecosystem in the Peyne area, approximately 60 km west of Montpellier in France, is selected as study site. For the study site an extensive remote sensing dataset is available. 	To determine and describe changes in vegetation communities in time I carried out a GIS based change detection study using a time series of 8 <b>aerial</b> photograph <b>mosaics</b> from 1946 to 2000. I followed three different approaches to optimise the detection of Mediterranean vegetation communities by remote sensing. In the first approach I have set up an experiment to evaluate the predictive power of 7 statistical techniques including innovative techniques like classification trees, random forests and support vector machines, to find the most important predictive factors and to define the extra value Hyper-spectral HyMap data over multi-spectral ASTER and Landsat 7 ETM+ data. In the second approach I included the spatial domain to analyze and classify remote sensing imagery. This approach not only uses the per-pixel spectral information but also the spectral information of neighbouring pixels. I used a contextual technique named SPARK (SPAtial Reclassification Kernel). The third approach was based on the incorporation of ancillary data or knowledge data into the classification process. I integrated spectral information, ancillary information and contextual information in a spatio-temporal image classification model: the Ancillary Data Classification Model (ADCM). Finally, I used the classification model as a basis for the land cover change prediction model. I limited the model to classes that I could detect with HyMap imagery. I calculated different scenarios to test the hypotheses formulated in the change detection study in space and time. The land cover change model proved to be a valuable tool to test hypotheses in space and time: the spatial interpretation of the model results pointed out which factors were important. I concluded that wetness index, solar radiation, lithology, effects of fire, and effects of grazing are key factors that explain land cover change of semi-natural Mediterranean vegetation communities...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing and GIS {{software}} is increasingly used in ecological research. Although {{there is a}} lot of imagery readily available from different suppliers, the spatial or temporal resolution often don't match the researchers need. Kite aerial photography can be used as a simple low cost remote sensing tool. In this research, kite aerial photographs are taken from a small nature reserve in the east of the Netherlands, 'de Borkeld' (lat,Ion: 52. 271265 °, 6. 491023 °). The camera used was a normal consumer digital camera (Canon s 70). For use in photogrammetic applications the camera had to be calibrated. The focal length, pixel size on the ccd, principal point and lens distortion were determined using Photomodeler 5. Before the aerial photographs were taken a grid of markers was placed in the study area and their positions and elevation was recorded with a geodetic dGPS. These markers served as ground control points in the georeferencing process. From 16 <b>aerial</b> photographs a <b>mosaic</b> was created covering 16. 9 hectares. The mosaic has a ground resolution of 8. 7 cm. From a subsection of the mosaic area a highly detailed digital terrain model was constructed. Using a supervised classification a vegetation map with 5 classes was created. The high resolution of the images gave some problems for the applied classification method. Due to variations in light and shadow, some misclassifications occurred. However the overall result was good. Especially Molinia caerulea, a species that replaces the heather vegetation, had a distinct spectral signature and was easy to identify. The heather coverage mainly consisted of Calluna vulgaris with some patches of Erica tetralix. By clipping out the heather area from the main image a supervised classification was done using only two classes; Calluna vulgaris and Erica tetralix. Using this method the patches with Erica tetralix could be predicted with high accuracy. Using kite aerial photography and normal digital cameras for photogrammetic purposes in ecological research shows great potential as a research tool. With the ongoing development of digital camera's and GIS software this method provides a way for researchers to obtain their own aerial images. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{desk review}} evaluates {{existing}} studies {{relating to the}} evolution of the coast adjacent to the Dounreay nuclear site and assesses their relevance to determining rates of past and future coastal change on the shoreline seaward of the proposed new Low Level Waste Facilities site. It considers the robustness of the existing UKAEA approach, identifies key areas of uncertainty and possible methods for reducing them, and proposes new methods of coastal erosion monitoring that can span the 30 year time frame for low level waste disposal in the new facilities. The review considered data, results and interpretations of coastal erosion rates for the Dounreay Shaft and Low Level Waste Pits areas, produced between 1995 and 2001. These were presented in five reports and one published paper. The studies used innovative techniques to assess both the erosive processes active on the cliffs and foreshore and to provide numerical estimates and models of annual rates of coastal retreat. These were systematically treated to provide the best evaluations that were possible at the time, but more modern methods are now available that should enable more realistic estimates of erosion rates to be made. The quality and detail of the data gathered during these studies increased in successive reports. They provide comprehensive literature reviews, summaries of the geology and geomorphology, and forecasts of future coastal erosion rates. Future shoreline and cliff top positions are shown in plan and cross-section. The data is illustrated on annotated <b>aerial</b> photograph <b>mosaics,</b> cross sections and simple coloured plans and maps. Computer-generated cliff-shoreline profiles, graphs of calculated rates of cliff recession, and rockhead contour plots were also produced. However, recommendations for further work were not implemented. Identification of the principal erosive processes active on the coast were thorough and the conceptual modelling of their effects incisive. The influence of effects of present climate and predominant wave direction were recognised and attempts were made to evaluate the effects of past and future climate and sea-level change. These latter estimates have become somewhat out-dated by the growing and ever changing estimates of future sea-level change and the extent and age of past glaciations. The reports provided estimates of maximum rates postulated from the Shaft and LLWP areas under 3 scenarios. Their possible impact on the new LLWF on time scales of 10, 000 to 25, 000 years rates is summarised in the report by Morgan and Wilmot as: Scenario – 1 ‘Normal Evolution’ 2 m sea-level rise = erosion concentrated in geos; Scenario 2 -‘Extended Global Warming’ 5 m sea-level rise = erosion of 55 mm pa (550 m in 10 ka);Scenario 3 - ‘Ice sheet collapse 9. 5 m sea-level rise = erosion of 55 mm pa for first 5 ka, 30 mm pa for the next 20 ka (875 m in 25 ka). A more conservative rate of 10 mm pa was subsequently adopted for the coastal constraint on the location of the new LLWF site. Many of the key uncertainties identified relate to limitations of the techniques available {{at the time of the}} studies. These include positional accuracy of some early measurement positions, the ability to scale-up limited 2 dimensional measurements to site-wide estimates, the difficulties of dating of erosional features and the somewhat simplified understanding of the geological complexity and variation within each site. The geological framework of the Dounreay area is now much better understood, largely due to subsequent and on-going site investigations. The problems of 2 D modelling and measurement can now be largely overcome by recent advances in GIS and 3 D computer modelling packages and modern field surveying equipment, such as dGPS and Laser scanning. Consequently, a more rigorous approach to monitoring bulk rates of coastal erosion in three dimensional space is possible and, with sequential monitoring over a 30 year period, a more complete four dimensional model of past and future coastal change is possible. The problem that short-term observations of erosion rates may not be truly indicative of long-term rates, and the possibility that no conclusive change in cliff position occurs during the 30 year operational life of the LLWF still exists. However, the use of lichenometry to date portions of the cliff line and rock platform, offers the opportunity to establish zones where negligible erosion has occurred during the last several hundred years. Sequential (every 5 years) targeted laser scanning of cliffs, slots, notches and foreshore platforms, from characteristic coastal zones (determined by an initial photogrametric survey), allows highly accurate quantitative measurement of both vertical and lateral erosion by a single technique. This, together with programmes of erosion pin monitoring, on-site and laboratory geotechnical testing, targeted to cover the range of rock types known to be present across each scanning site, will give objective geo-referenced measurements. These will enable 3 D erosion rate monitoring and also the construction of 4 D bulk rock mass assessment models of coastal evolution that accurately reflect changes during the 30 year monitoring period. The techniques will also produce numerical data suitable for inclusion in time-series computer models of future coastal evolution of the site...|$|R
40|$|A finalidade do presente trabalho foi efetuar um reconhecimento fotogeológico na parte sul do Estado de São Paulo, para a obtenção de um mapa base para futuros trabalhos de detalhe. Foram utilizadas fotografias aéreas e mosaicos do Instituto Agronômico do Estado, na escala de 1 : 25. 000. Os critérios utilizados na fotointerpretação foram: 1) a erosão diferencial, que, com exceção das áreas peneplanizatlas, constituiu o {{principal}} critério de identificação das diversas litologias; 2) o padrão de drenagem, refletindo a situação estrutural da rocha subjacente; 3) as relações texturais, importantes na distinção de tipos litológicos particulares, que apresentam padrões especiais de texturas. A geologia da área acha-se representada por rochas metamórficas, as quais predominam tôda a região, com exceção na sua parte leste e norte, onde se acham recobertas por sedimentos cenozóicos e os da Bacia do Paraná, respectivamente. Com relação às rochas metamórficas, nota-se um crescente aumento no grau de metamorfismo de oeste para leste. As estruturas, de um modo geral, possuem direção NE ou E-NE, compreendendo falhas principais, a forma dos corpos graníticos, as linhas de cristas e os padrões das intercalações. Os traços de fratura seguem direção paralela à xistosidade, havendo também, um sistema conspícuo de direção NW, mais recente e associado em determinadas regiões, a diques de diabásio. Os mergulhos dos elementos planares são quase sempre para NW, enquanto que os eixos das dobras apresentam caimento «plunge» para NE. Devido à tendência regional das estruturas, pode-se sugerir que o esfôrço principal que provocou os dobrameutos do Grupo Açungui foi proveniente de NW, tendo havido uma zona estável e rígida ao lado E ou SE. O Grupo Açungui teria, então, constituído um miogessinclinal, cujo diastrofismo produziu dobras inclinadas em direção ao antepais. Os granitos, interpretados como resultado da palingênese, foram introduzidos nos melassedimentos em núcleos de anticlmais, ao mesmo tempo, ou pouco após o principal diastrofismo. Os primeiros granitos, de caráter sintectônico, são concordantes com as estruturas encaixantes. Os de idade posterior, de caráter post-tectônicos, cortam discordantemente as estruturas. With {{the present}} paper the authors had in mind {{to work out a}} photogeological survey {{in the southern part of}} the State of São Paulo in order to obtain a basic map for future detailed work. For this purpose <b>aerial</b> photographs and <b>mosaics</b> of the Insttiuto Agronômico were used, ata 1 : 25. 000 scale. The criteria utilized in the photo-interpretation were the following: 1) the differential erosion, excepted peneplanized areas, constituted the main criterium of identification of the various lithologies; 2) the drainage pattern reflecting the structural situation of subjacent rocks; 3) the textural relations, important in the distinguishing of particular lithological types which present special textural patterns. The geology of the area is represented by metamorphic rocks which predominate in the whole region with the exception of the eastern and northern parts where they are covered by cenozoic sediments and by those of the Paraná Basin respectively. With regard to the metamorphic rocks a more and more increasing grade of metamorphism is noted from west to east. In a general way, the structures are directed NE or E-NE, comprising main faults, the shape of granitic bodies, the lines of crests and the patterns of the intercalations. The traces of fractures, follow a parallel direction to xislosity, there being also a conspicuous system in a NW direction, more recent and associated, in certain regions, to diabase diques. The dip of planar elements arc practically always toward NW, whereas the axes of the folds plunge toward NE. Due to the regional tendency of structures, one may suggest that the main effort causing folding of the Açungui Group proceeded from NW. while there had been a stable and rigid zone to the E or SE side. The Açungui Group should then have constituted a miogessinclinal whose diastrophism has produced sloping folds toward the foreland. The granites, interpreted as result of the palingenesis, were introduced in the metasediments in anticlinal nucleus at the same time, or somewhat later, after the main diastrophism. The first granites of syntectonic nature are concordant with the country rock structures. Those of a later age, of post-tectonic nature, cut through the structures in a discordant way...|$|R
