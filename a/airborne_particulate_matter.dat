40|$|Exposure to <b>airborne</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matters</b> (PM) emitted during cooking {{can lead}} to adverse health effects. An {{understanding}} of the exposure to PM during cooking at home provides a foundation for the quantification of possible health risks. The concentrations of airborne particles covering the ultrafine (14. 6 - 100 nm) and accumulation mode (100 - 661. 2 nm) size ranges and PM(2. 5) (<b>airborne</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matters</b> smaller than 2. 5 mu m in diameter) during and after cooking activities were measured in 12 naturally ventilated, nonsmoking homes in Hong Kong, covering a total of 33 cooking episodes. The monitored homes all practiced Chinese-style cooking. Cooking elevated the average number concentrations of ultrafine particles (UFPs) and accumulation mode particles (AMPs) by 10 fold from the background level {{in the living room}} and by 20 - 40 fold in the kitchen. PM(2. 5) mass concentrations went up to the maximum average of about 160 pig m(- 3) in the kitchen and about 60 mu g m(- 3) in the living room. Cooking emitted particles dispersed quickly from the kitchen to the living room indicating that the health impact is not limited to occupants in the kitchen. Particle number and mass concentrations remained elevated for 90 min in the kitchen and for 60 min in the living room after cooking. Particles in cooking emissions were mainly in the ultrafine size range in terms of the number count while AMPs contributed to at least 60 % of the surface area concentrations in the kitchen and 73 % in the living room. This suggests that AMPs could still be a major health concern since the particle surface area concentration is suggested to have a more direct relationship with inhalation toxicity than with number concentration. Particle number concentration (14. 6 - 661. 2 nm) in the living room was about 2. 7 times that in the outdoor environment, suggesting that better ventilation could help reduce exposure.

The residue from stage 1, with 10 ml of sodium acetate 1 M the pH was adjusted to 5 with acetic acid. Then the sample was centrifuged as stage 1. In the third stage heavy metals bound to iron and manganese oxides were extracted. The residue from stage 2 was reacted with 10 ml hydroxyl amine hydrochloride at 25 % v/v.

Results: The average PM 10 concentration in the reference cabin was 100 µg/m 3, and the PM 10 concentration in the cabin with the control device was 79 µg/m 3. While the overall control efficiency of the control device was 15. 4 %, reduction was more effective for peak PM 10 concentration. However, PM 2. 5 levels did not differ greatly between the reference cabin and the cabin with the control device. The ratio of PM 2. 5 to PM 10 was 0. 37. PM 10 concentrations in cabins were not associated with ambient concentrations, indicating that the main sources of PM 10 were present in cabins. Additionally, average CO 2 concentration in the cabins was 1, 359 ppm, less than the maximum of 2, 000 ppm set out by the Korean Ministry of Environment’s guideline. The CO 2 concentration in cabins was significantly associated with the number of passengers: the in-cabin concentration = 23. 4 × N + 460. 2, where N is the number of passengers. Conclusions: Application of the PM control device can improve PM 10 concentration, especially at peak levels but not PM 2. 5 concentration...|$|R
