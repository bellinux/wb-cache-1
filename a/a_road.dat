5|$|<b>A</b> <b>road</b> through Jamacha is {{mentioned}} in The San Diego Union {{as early as}} February1908, and was oiled in 1935 from US 80 (Main Street) around El Cajon to Sweetwater Valley and in other places by the Sweetwater River.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>road</b> up Stjørdalen {{was built}} during the 1850s, {{connecting}} at Stjørdalshalsen to a steam ship service to Trondheim. A concern in Sweden was that Bottenviken could freeze {{up and that}} the Trondheimsfjord offered an ice-free alternative for export of timber.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>Roads</b> {{serve the}} same purpose and provide the same high quality road {{conditions}} as M roads, the only difference being that <b>A</b> <b>roads</b> are single carriageways. <b>A</b> <b>roads</b> also carry less traffic than M roads. For example, the Princes Highway west of Geelong is route number A1.|$|R
50|$|Raible Ave is <b>a</b> {{boundary}} <b>road</b> for North Anderson and Anderson for 1.4 Miles. Hartman Rd is <b>a</b> boundary <b>road</b> for North Anderson and Anderson for 2.6 miles.

2500|$|B {{roads are}} {{numbered}} collector routes, which have lower traffic densities than the main trunk <b>roads,</b> or <b>A</b> <b>roads.</b> [...] This classification {{has nothing to}} do with the width or quality of the physical road, and B roads can range from dual carriageways to single track roads with passing places. B roads follow the same numbering scheme as <b>A</b> <b>roads,</b> but almost always have 3- and 4-digit designations. Many 3-digit B roads outside the London area are former <b>A</b> <b>roads</b> which have been downgraded owing to new road construction; others may link smaller settlements to <b>A</b> <b>roads.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>road</b> {{was built}} {{the same year}} on the plateau to provide easy access to outlooks over the amphitheaters. From 1924 to 1925, Bryce Canyon Lodge was built from local timber and stone.|$|E
5|$|After lynching Sam Carter, the mob met Sylvester Carrier—Aaron's {{cousin and}} Sarah's son—on <b>a</b> <b>road</b> {{and told him}} to get out of town. Carrier refused, and when the mob moved on, he {{suggested}} gathering {{as many people as possible}} for protection.|$|E
5|$|As of 1831 {{there was}} a {{settlement}} named Hadspen near a ford of the South Esk River. <b>A</b> <b>road</b> was proposed from Launceston, crossing the river at this ford near Thomas Haydock Reibey's property of Entally.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> {{frontage}} <b>road</b> (also {{known as}} <b>an</b> access <b>road,</b> service road, parallel <b>road,</b> etc.) is <b>a</b> local <b>road</b> running parallel to <b>a</b> higher-speed, limited-access <b>road.</b> <b>A</b> frontage <b>road</b> {{is often used}} to provide access to private driveways, shops, houses, industries or farms. Where parallel high-speed roads are provided as part of a major highway, these are also known as local-express lanes.|$|R
5|$|Before the {{designation}} of SR78, <b>a</b> <b>road</b> known as the Brawley-Westmorland-Julian-Oceanside Highway (connecting Oceanside, Escondido, Ramona, Julian, Westmorland, and Brawley) existed during the early twentieth century. This road roughly followed the current routing of SR78 from Escondido {{to the east of}} Brawley, although it traveled along a different routing from Westmorland into Brawley. No road connected Brawley with Glamis in 1919; it was necessary to travel north through Calipatria to reach Blythe. East of the Sand Hills, there was <b>a</b> <b>road</b> from Glamis passing by Smith Well into Palo Verde, which roughly follows the routing of SR78.|$|E
5|$|Bridges {{and other}} key points were {{prepared}} for demolition at short notice by preparing chambers filled with explosives. A Depth Charge Crater was a site in <b>a</b> <b>road</b> (usually at a junction) prepared with buried explosives that could be detonated to instantly form a deep crater as an anti-tank obstacle. The Canadian pipe mine (later known as the McNaughton Tube after General Andrew McNaughton) was a horizontally bored pipe packed with explosives– once in place this {{could be used to}} instantly ruin <b>a</b> <b>road</b> or runway. Prepared demolitions had the advantage of being undetectable from the air—the enemy could not take any precautions against them, or plot a route of attack around them.|$|E
5|$|Coal lies {{under the}} area of mines opened in the Industrial Revolution, {{providing}} fuel for the cotton spinning and papermaking industries. By the mid-19th century, Radcliffe was an important mill town with cotton mills, bleachworks and <b>a</b> <b>road,</b> canal and railway network.|$|E

Two years later <b>an</b> {{all-weather}} <b>road</b> reached the town {{from the north and}} <b>a</b> dry-weather <b>road</b> south to Negele Borana. This town has both telephone and postal service, and is supplied with electricity by the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation from the national grid.|$|R
50|$|Intersections {{that involve}} <b>a</b> minor <b>road</b> {{crossing}} <b>a</b> main <b>road</b> are often made into staggered junctions to prevent traffic going straight across <b>a</b> main <b>road</b> without stopping {{to check for}} oncoming vehicles.|$|R

5|$|In {{a letter}} dated 12 June 1842 in the Colonial Secretary's Records, Marshall Clifton, Chief Commissioner of the Western Australian Land Company, {{wrote of the}} need for an {{improved}} Perth–Fremantle–Bunbury road. On a special trip he took in the previous October to look for a new route, two surveyors gave their approval to the proposed coastal route, with a ferry across the estuary. Governor John Hutt approved of the idea of <b>a</b> <b>road,</b> but thought a ferry would be impractical, at least during winter, and that the lack of public funds made it impossible. Clifton continued to write letters to the Colonial Secretary advocating the construction of <b>a</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
