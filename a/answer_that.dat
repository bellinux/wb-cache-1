5|$|According to a MinnPost poll, Minnesotans {{blamed the}} Republican {{legislature}} {{more for the}} shutdown. Overall, 42% said Republicans in the legislature were more responsible, 21% said the DFL governor was more responsible, and 22% volunteered an <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> they were equally to blame. As expected, partisans blamed the other party more; only 10% of Republicans blamed the legislature more, and only 2% of DFLers blamed Dayton more. Following the shutdown, DFL Representative Phyllis Kahn authored a continuing appropriations bill that would prevent government shutdowns {{in the event of}} disagreements between the governor and legislature, as she had done in several past sessions. The House commissioned a policy brief from its research department, published in December 2011, that looked into what such a bill would require. The brief noted that such ideas had been considered before, including after the 2005 shutdown, and had been abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Mathematicians became {{interested}} in mirror symmetry around 1990 when physicists Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed that mirror symmetry {{could be used to}} solve problems in enumerative geometry that had resisted solution for decades or more. These results were presented to mathematicians at a conference at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, California in May 1991. During this conference, it was noticed that one of the numbers Candelas had computed for the counting of rational curves disagreed with the number obtained by Norwegian mathematicians Geir Ellingsrud and Stein Arild Strømme using ostensibly more rigorous techniques. Many mathematicians at the conference assumed that Candelas's work contained a mistake since it was not based on rigorous mathematical arguments. However, after examining their solution, Ellingsrud and Strømme discovered an error in their computer code and, upon fixing the code, they got an <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> agreed with the one obtained by Candelas and his collaborators.|$|E

5|$|Munch (Richard Belzer) and Bolander (Ned Beatty) {{respond to}} a corpse found in the woods, next to a van full of low-quality marijuana. Munch proves {{to be an expert}} on hemp, and {{discusses}} how the plant was grown by founding fathers Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. The detectives eventually identify the victim as a middle man for a drug dealer, and Bolander finds a neighbor who saw Jones holding a gun to the victim's head the night before the murder. Munch, Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and narcotics detective Russ DeSilva (Steven Marcus) debate whether drugs should be illegal; the homicide detectives claim legalization would reduce violent crime and that drug revenue could go to good causes. Bolander asks Munch if he smokes pot, but he refuses to <b>answer.</b> <b>That</b> night, Munch and Bolander arrest the drug dealer at home.|$|E
5|$|Some {{say that}} {{nothing could be more}} desperate than the measure, but I <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> the state of the Province {{admitted}} of nothing but desperate remedies. I got possession of the letters my antagonist addressed to the Secretary at War, and also of the sentiments which hundreds of his army uttered to their friends. Confidence in the General was gone, and evident despondency prevailed throughout. I have succeeded beyond expectation. I crossed the river contrary to the opinion of Cols. Procter, St. George etc.; it is therefore no wonder that envy should attribute to good fortune what in justice to my own discernment, I must say, proceeded from a cool calculation of the pours and contres.|$|E

25|$|We can {{extrapolate}} {{from the}} above table that the step size needed to get an <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> is correct to three decimal places is approximately 0.00001, meaning that we need 400,000 steps. This large number of steps entails a high computational cost. For this reason, people usually employ alternative, higher-order methods such as Runge–Kutta methods or linear multistep methods, especially if a high accuracy is desired.|$|E

In such a situation, the men will carry out a training scenario, believing it to be reality while ignoring sensory information that contradicts the scenario.
