5|$|At first, {{he is the}} {{lieutenant}} of Gabriel Roman, and helps him hold Sullivan and Drake hostage. He also leads a team of highly trained mercenaries hired by Roman. Though never made into a chapter, Nate and Elena attempt to sneak into an airship to get to an island in search of El Dorado, but the area was infested by Navarro's mercenaries. After killing them, Navarro appears in an armored truck and begins firing <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> a chaingun. Nate knocks a telephone pole on his truck using explosive barrels, and escapes on the plane with Elena. Sometime later, he and Roman travel to the island so Roman can sell El Dorado {{for a lot of}} money that Sully owes him (who they took with them when Nate thought he was dead), unaware that Navarro has his own plan of selling it. Eventually, they team up with Eddy Raja, who is also searching for statue of El Dorado, and try to keep Nate away from it.|$|E
5|$|By {{three in}} the afternoon, the British had reached a ravine known as Stockton Hollow, {{about a half a}} mile (0.8km) from Trenton where the Americans were forming another line of defense. Washington wanted to hold the British off until nightfall, when {{darkness}} would prevent the British from attacking his defenses {{on the south side of}} Assunpink Creek. The British, with artillery in position, attacked Hand's new position, and he gave way, slowly falling back into Trenton. Along the way, Hand had his troops fire from behind houses. As Hand's troops came to the creek, the Hessians charged <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> bayonets fixed, causing chaos among the Americans. Washington, seeing the chaos, rode out through the crowd of men crossing the bridge, and shouted that Hand's rear guard pull back and regroup under the cover of the American artillery.|$|E
5|$|The Sajkab'chen {{company of}} native musketeers pushed {{ahead with the}} road {{builders}} from Tzuktzok' to the first Kejache town at Chunpich, which the Kejache had fled, leaving behind {{a substantial amount of}} food. The company's officers sent for reinforcements from García at Tzuktok' but before any could arrive some 25 Kejache returned to Chunpich with baskets to collect their abandoned food. The nervous Sajkab'chen sentries feared that the residents were returning en masse and discharged their muskets <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>with</b> both groups then retreating. The musketeer company then arrived to reinforce their sentries and charged into battle against approaching Kejache archers. Several musketeers were injured in the ensuing skirmish, and the Kejache retreated along a forest path without injury, mocking the invaders. The Sajkab'chen company followed the path and found two more deserted settlements with large amounts of abandoned food. They seized the food and retreated back along the path.|$|E

25|$|Remaining ashore overnight, {{they heard}} cries near the encampment.

25|$|Johnson {{was given}} a regular column in The Spectator, The Daily Telegraph sister publication; it {{attracted}} mixed reviews and was often thought rushed. In 1999, he was also given a column on new cars in the magazine GQ. His behaviour regularly annoyed his editors; those at GQ were frustrated by {{the large number of}} parking fines that Johnson acquired while testing cars for them, while he was consistently late in providing his columns for The Telegraph and The Spectator, forcing many staff to stay late to accommodate him; they related that if they went ahead and published without his work included, he would get angry and shout <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> expletives.|$|E
25|$|In one famous case a {{subordinate}} of EHA {{working in the}} Salt department in Kanara came to his bungalow with a snake on his shoulder.

'It is a King cobra, and you have not killed it' replied Eha. The snake was put in a crate and sent to the BNHS with the note 'It may not survive the journey. If it does not you will know it by the smell. If there be no smell be careful.' The snake survived for two years in the BNHS.|$|E
25|$|Authorities rated Rîmaru's {{modus operandi}} as ferocious and cruel, {{based on his}} {{propensity}} for cutting off clothes, biting off flesh, dragging his victims, and hacking away <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> his weapons, also raping them while they were unconscious. Rîmaru was judged to be aggressive, impulsive and sadistic. He showed signs of vampirism; for instance, he poked several holes into the flesh of Florica Marcu, who later related how he sucked blood out of them. Cannibalism was also present; he would bite women's vaginas, pubic areas and breasts, and the missing pieces of flesh were no longer found at the crime scenes. Additionally, he had necrophiliac tendencies, continuing his rapes after his victims had died and also beating and stabbing their corpses.|$|E

25|$|Occasionally, these {{pelicans}} may nest in colonies on isolated islands, {{which is}} believed to significantly {{reduce the likelihood of}} mammalian predation. Red foxes and coyotes readily predate colonies that they can access, the later being the only known species to hunt adult pelicans (which are too large for most bird predators to subdue). Several gulls have been known to predate pelican eggs and nestlings (including herring, ring-billed and California gull), as well as common ravens. Young pelicans may be hunted by great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, bald eagles, and golden eagles. The pelicans react to mammalian threats differently from avian threats. Though fairly approachable while feeding, the pelicans may temporarily abandon their nests if a human or other large mammal closely approaches the colony. If the threat is another bird, however, the pelicans do not abandon the nest and may fight off the interloper by jabbing <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> their considerable bills.|$|E
25|$|At dawn on {{the next}} day, Loredan sent two galleys, bearing the Banner of Saint Mark, to the entry of the port of Gallipoli to open negotiations. In {{response}} the Turks sent 32 ships to attack them. Loredan withdrew his two galleys, and began to withdraw, while shooting at the Turkish ships, in order to lure them away from Gallipoli. As the Ottoman ships could {{not keep up with}} their oars, they set sail; on the Venetian side, the galley from Napoli di Romania tarried during the manoeuvre and was in danger of being caught by the pursuing Ottoman ships, so that Loredan likewise ordered his ships to set sail. Once they were had made ready for combat, Loredan ordered his ten galleys to lower sails, turn about, and face the Ottoman fleet. At that point, however, the eastern wind rose suddenly, and allowed the Ottomans to break off the pursuit and head back to Gallipoli. Loredan in turn tried {{to catch up with the}} Ottomans, firing <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> his guns and crossbows and launching grappling hooks at the Turkish ships, but the wind and the current allowed the Ottomans to retreat speedily behind the fortifications of Gallipoli. According to Loredan, the engagement lasted until the 22nd hour.|$|E
25|$|The Turkish mounted archers {{attacked}} in their usual style - charging in, shooting their arrows, and quickly retreating before the crusaders could counterattack. The archers did little {{damage to the}} heavily armoured knights, but they inflicted heavy casualties on the horses and unarmoured foot soldiers. Bohemond had sent messengers to the other Crusader army and now struggled to hold on until help arrived, and his army was being forced back to {{the bank of the}} Thymbris river. The marshy riverbanks protected the crusaders from mounted charge, as the ground was too soft for horses, and the armoured knights formed a circle protecting the foot soldiers and noncombatants from arrows, but the Turks kept their archers constantly supplied and the sheer number of arrows was taking its toll, reportedly more than 2,000 falling to horse-archers. Bohemond's knights were impetuous - although ordered to stand ground, small groups of knights would periodically break ranks and charge, only to be slaughtered or forced back as the Turkish horses fell back beyond range of their swords and arrows, while still shooting <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> arrows, killing many of the knights' horses out from under them. And although the knights' armour protected them well (the Turks called them 'men of iron') the sheer number of arrows meant that some would find unprotected spots and eventually, after so many hits, a knight would collapse from his wounds.|$|E

The turnkey says his features were scarcely changed, as he looked <b>at</b> <b>'em</b> <b>with</b> the early sun a-shining in at the grating upon him.

25|$|Noah tracks Sylar and Elle {{down at the}} Canfield {{household}} and watches them have sex through the scope of a sniper rifle. Afterwards, he opens fire, misses, and then breaks {{into the house and}} shoots <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> a Company handgun, hitting Elle in the left thigh and forcing them into a retreat. While looking for them, Noah receives a call from Sandra in which she informs him that Claire is hospitalized. Instead of immediately rushing to the hospital, Noah follows a trail of Elle's blood to a local grocery store. After luring him into a back room, Sylar jumps him from behind, but he is once again outmatched without his powers against Noah's fighting skills. Ultimately, after tossing the ultimate insult ("Poor Gabriel. You always wanted to be special. Now look at you; you're nobody."), he slits Sylar's throat with a box cutter. When he returns home, Claire is understandably angered with him for focusing on Sylar rather than rushing to the hospital. When Claire reveals that she had died in the hospital, Noah realizes something awful: if Claire's powers are back, then so are Sylar's. Indeed, Sylar and Elle, newly empowered, have made it to the Bennet {{household and}} are holding Sandra and Lyle hostage. Sylar telekinetically disarms Noah, pins him to the wall, and begins to strangle him with his powers. Claire desperately swears to go with Sylar in exchange for leaving her family alone, but Sylar is unsatisfied with that and begins to cut into Noah's neck, clearly intent on decapitating him. Fortunately, Hiro Nakamura arrives, teleports Sylar and Elle away, and then time-travels with Claire back to the day when his father first assigned Noah to protect her.|$|E
500|$|The nuthatches are a genus, Sitta, {{of small}} {{passerine}} birds which derive their English {{name from the}} propensity of some species to wedge large insects or seeds into cracks, and then hack <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> their strong bills. Sitta is derived from sittē, the Ancient Greek for nuthatch, and carolinensis means [...] "of Carolina" [...] in Latin.
