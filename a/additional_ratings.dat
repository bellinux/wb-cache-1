50|$|Mountain Creek {{opened its}} 2007-08 winter sports {{season with a}} few notable changes to the trail map. The eastern side of Vernon Peak, {{which used to be}} home to its {{freestyle}} terrain park, was converted into intermediate slopes. The entire Mountain Creek South area (South Peak and Bear Peak) was converted to freestyle terrain park. This angered many long-time season pass holders and many did not renew their passes. A special terrain park pass was now needed to use this area of the mountain. All slopes off those peaks are intermediate trails with <b>additional</b> <b>ratings</b> for the kind of freestyle terrain from small to extra large. Additionally, a long intermediate trail off the Granite Peak, called Granite View, was closed. Minor changes were also made in the dining structure, including replacement of the one-time-use rental lockers with a more compact bag-check station. The resort was now known to be filled with crazy and wild snowboarders and skiers. The accident rates increased and so did the trips to the local hospitals.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{on the role of}} recognition in decision-making in inferential choice has focussed on the Recognition Heuristic (RH), which proposes that in situations where recognition is predictive of a decision criterion, recognized objects will be chosen over unrecognized ones, regardless of any other available relevant information. In the current study we examine the role of recognition in preferential choice, in which participants had to choose one of a pair of consumer objects that were presented with quality ratings (positive, neutral, and negative). The results showed that participants’ choices were largely based on recognition, as the famous brand was preferred even when <b>additional</b> star <b>ratings</b> rendered it as less attractive. However, the additional information did affect the proportion of chosen famous items, in particular in the cases when star ratings for the recognised brand were negative. This condition also resulted in longer response times compared to neutral and positive conditions. Thus, the current data do not point to a simple compensatory mechanism in preferential choice: although choice is affected by additional information, it seems that recognition is employed as an initial important first step in the decision-making process...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examined}} {{similarities and differences}} in the personal and social adjustment of intellectually gifted and average adolescents along six criteria: independent-dominant and responsible-cooperative interpersonal behavior, moderation of interpersonal behavior, unity or integration of personality, self acceptance, and accuracy of self perception. Two matched groups of 42 subjects each, one with Kis from 130 to 150, the other with I 0 's between 90 and 110, completed the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) and the LaForge-Suczek Interpersonal Check List. <b>Additional</b> interpersonal <b>ratings</b> were secured from teachers and classmates. Results on interpersonal behavior indicated that the superior students were significantly higher in independent-dominant traits, aggressive-rebellious traits, and responsible-cooperative traits. On the TAT average students expressed {{a higher proportion of}} themes of masochism-weakness and conformity-trust. On concepts of ideal traits a significantly larger number of average subjects fell above the median on the responsible-cooperative cluster. On all other items, superior students failed to differ significantly. It was thus concluded that factors other than intellect influence personal and social adjustment.

40|$|BACKGROUND. The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is a {{quick and}} simple measure of overall {{psychological}} disturbance. However, there is little research on {{the reliability and validity}} of this measure in severely mentally ill populations. METHOD. Multidisciplinary keyworkers assessed 103 patients at monthly intervals over a 6 -month period. Overall GAF scores were obtained, with <b>additional</b> separate <b>ratings</b> for symptoms and disability. These were compared with changes in antipsychotic medication and support needs over the same period. RESULTS. Satisfactory reliability was obtained for total GAF score and for symptom and disability measures, in spite of raters having only one brief training session. All GAF scores were associated with current support needs of patients. Symptom and disability scores were associated with changes in antipsychotic medication in the previous month. Only symptom score was associated with increases in antipsychotic medication at time of rating. CONCLUSION. GAF proved to be a reliable and, within the limits of the indicators used, a valid measure of psychiatric disturbance in our sample of the severely mentally ill. Differences in relationships between the three GAF scores and medication/support needs indicate the usefulness of obtaining all three scores for monitoring levels and type of psychiatric disturbance in this population...|$|R
40|$|Emotional {{reasoning}} {{refers to}} the use of subjective emotions, rather than objective evidence, to form conclusions about oneself and the world [1]. Emotional reasoning appears to characterise anxiety disorders. We aimed to determine whether elevated levels of emotional reasoning also characterise dysphoria. In Study 1, low dysphoric (BDI-II# 4; n = 28) and high dysphoric (BDI-II $ 14; n = 42) university students were administered an emotional reasoning task relevant for dysphoria. In Study 2, a larger university sample were administered the same task, with <b>additional</b> self-referent <b>ratings,</b> and were followed up 8 weeks later. In Study 1, both the low and high dysphoric participants demonstrated emotional reasoning and {{there were no significant differences}} in scores on the emotional reasoning task between the low and high dysphoric groups. In Study 2, self-referent emotional reasoning interpretations showed small-sized positive correlations with depression symptoms. Emotional reasoning tendencies were stable across an 8 -week interval although not predictive of subsequent depressive symptoms. Further, anxiety symptoms were independently associated with emotional reasoning and emotional reasoning was not associated with anxiety sensitivity, alexithymia, or deductive reasoning tendencies. The implications of these findings are discussed, including the possibility that while all individuals may engage in emotional reasoning, self-referent emotional reasoning may be associated with increased levels of depressive symptoms...|$|R
50|$|<b>Additional</b> {{measures}} include <b>ratings</b> for {{the quality}} and distinctiveness of the programmes. There are a selection of other questions that form part of the survey - some that are always asked, and some that may be asked depending on the programme. An example of the former is to note how much of each programme was watched, using a scale of 1-10, where '10' means that the viewer watched it all, and '1' means that they watched very little. Also of key importance to the BBC {{is to find out}} whether the viewers considered a programme to be of 'high quality'. An example of the latter would be a question designed to gauge whether the viewer 'learned something new'. Viewers are also asked to rate how much effort they took to view the programme—whether they made a special effort, just some effort, or watched it because it was on.|$|R

40|$|Four studies {{demonstrated}} that perceivers {{were able to}} identify the political attitudes of unknown politicians on a left–right dimension when the targets were merely shown in photographs. In Study 1, party membership provided an objective criterion for political attitudes, whereas actual voting behavior served as a validity criterion in Studies 2, 3 a, and 3 b. All studies yielded ratings highly chance accuracy. <b>Additional</b> <b>ratings</b> suggest that perceived dominance may partly account for the effect. Moreover, perceivers were more accurate when they rated politicians whose attitudes were opposite to their own position, reflecting a more liberal criterion for out-group than for in-group members.

30|$|Ranking {{process is}} one of the vital {{processes}} in recommendation systems. A number of methods have proposed for recommendation system such as content-based filtering (CBF) [8], collaborative filtering (CF) [9] and hybrid approaches [10]. These approaches mostly utilise user profiles in the ranking process and they usually consider a single-criterion value (i.e., overall rating). However, users may depend on more than one utility aspect when making their choices. For instance, Yahoo! Movies! ([URL] have employed multi-criteria ratings. Rather than an overall rating, it provides four <b>additional</b> <b>ratings</b> (i.e., Story, Acting, Direction, Visuals). A number of studies investigated the use of multi-criteria approach [11 – 13] in order to incorporate additional contextual information (criteria) such as time, gender, age, etc. Nevertheless, these studies mainly targeted web-based environment and neglected dynamic contexts and did not model the dynamic changes in users’ interests.|$|E
40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is a severe chronic neuropathic pain {{condition}} {{defined as a}} spontaneous pain or allodynia corresponding to a vascular lesion. It usually evolves weeks after stroke, and can distinctively impair the quality of life. Treatment is complex and mostly unsatisfactory. We hypothesized that the anti-epileptic drug levetiracetam (LEV) improves CPSP compared with placebo. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the efficacy and tolerability of LEV in patients with CPSP. Methods In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study design patients with CPSP lasting at least 3 months and a pain score ≥ 4 on the 11 -point Likert scale were treated over two 8 -week periods with a maximum dose up to 3000 mg LEV or placebo. Primary endpoint was a median pain lowering ≥ 2 in the final treatment week compared with the last baseline week. Secondary outcome measures comprised <b>additional</b> pain <b>ratings,</b> depression, sleep quality, quality of life and patients' global impression of change. Results Of 42 patients, 33 [61. 5 years (40 – 76); 38 % women] completed the study. Side effects and withdrawals were more frequent in the LEV (n = 5) group than in the placebo group (n = 1). Patients treated with LEV did not show any improvement of pain or changes in secondary outcome parameters compared with placebo. Conclusions LEV is not effective in treatment for CPSP. The mode of action of LEV does not exert an analgesic effect in chronic CPSP...|$|R
40|$|Attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) is {{a severe}} mental illness, associated with major impairment {{and a high}} comorbidity rate. Particularly undiagnosed ADHD in adulthood has serious consequences. Thus, a valid diagnosis is important. In adulthood, the diagnostic process for ADHD is complicated: symptoms may overlap with comorbid disorders, and the onset and progression of the disorder must be reconstructed retrospectively. Guidelines for the diagnostic process recommend the inclusion of <b>additional</b> informant <b>ratings.</b> Research into the relation between self- and informant ratings shows extremely heterogeneous results. The levels of agreement range from low to high. The focus {{of this study is}} the concordance and differences between self- and informant ratings on ADHD symptoms and impairments. In this regard, two possible influencing factors (gender and relationship type) are also examined. 114 people participated in this study, 77 with an ADHD diagnosis and 37 without a diagnosis. For all participants, either parents or partners also rated ADHD symptoms and impairments. Small to moderate concordance was found between self- and informant ratings, with females being slightly more concordant than males, particularly for ratings of problems with self-concept. Examination of the consistency within a particular perspective showed that people with ADHD seemed to be unaware of the causal relation between ADHD symptoms and their impairments. A close investigation found almost no influence of gender and relationship type on differences within perspectives. Based on these results, the implications for the diagnostic process are that additional informant information is clearly necessary and helpful...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in order to determine if the amount of justification for a crime and the physical attractiveness of a defendant would influence the severity of sentence imposed on the defendant by subjects who were asked to act as jurors. Subjects were 240 male and female undergraduate students who volunteered from introductory psychology classes. Forty subjects were assigned to each of six treatment conditions produced by three levels of attractiveness: attractive, unattractive, and no-picture; and by the two levels of justification: high and low. Subjects read a short vignette of a crime and were asked to determine a length of sentence. <b>Additional,</b> related <b>ratings</b> were also made. Those defendants in the high justification condition were handed less severe sentences than those in the low justification condition. However, the results did not support the second hypothesis which stated that the attractive defendant would be sentenced to fewer years imprisonment than would the unattractive defendant. The final hypothesis predicted that there would be an interaction between the attractiveness and justification variables, i. e., that the attractive defendant would be punished less severely than the unattractive defendant when justification for committing the crime was low, and for the high justification condition, the effect of the attractiveness would be attenuated. Results did not support this hypothesis. However, related findings provided by the additional scales yielded data which could be interpreted as indirect support for the main hypotheses. Thesis (M.
