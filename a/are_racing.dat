500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally I felt he drove me wide. You could say he had the right to do that because he had the track position, but I think it was a deliberate gesture in trying to run someone wide like that and I was very angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they <b>are</b> <b>racing</b> drivers aren't they?" [...] GrandPrix.com said that Coulthard's overtake meant that [...] "He is ready to stand up to Michael and he is not afraid of what will happen if Michael does not lift." ...|$|E
500|$|After beating levels, new modes become available, {{such as the}} Relic Race, {{in which}} the player races through the track alone and completes three laps in the fastest time possible. [...] "Time Crates" [...] {{scattered}} throughout the level freeze the game timer when a player drives through them. If all of the Time Crates are destroyed, the player's final time is reduced by ten seconds. The player wins a Relic by beating the time indicated on the screen. Another mode, the CTR Challenge, is played like a normal race, except that the player must also collect the letters C, T and R scattered throughout the track. If the player manages to collect all three letters and come in first place, a [...] "CTR Token" [...] is awarded. These tokens come in five different colors: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow and Purple. The Purple CTR tokens are awarded for beating the Crystal Bonus Round by collecting 20 Crystal under a certain time limit. If the player collects four tokens of the same color, the player {{will be able to}} access the Gem Cup of the corresponding color. Gem Cups <b>are</b> <b>racing</b> tournaments held against computer-controlled opponents and are accessible in a secret area in the [...] "Gemstone Valley" [...] world. A Gem Cup consists of four tracks in a row, in which the player must race for points. If one of these cups is won, a Gem is awarded.

2500|$|The {{developers}} {{stated that}} they wanted to keep a certain amount of realism to the setting of their game. [...] "It's not science fiction, it's like racing on the most beautiful places on earth" [...] stated Senior Game Designer Peter Petrekovits. Development began with low polygon versions of the game's three settings to hone gameplay, which were later upgraded with details created from primitive shapes. Artists then took these settings and provided finalized environments while course designers laid out the specific elements to each race. Multiple routes were created in each setting allowing for several course configurations. Some of the plane designs were inspired from real-world fighter planes, but each were evolved from initial concept art into their current designs. Petrekovits elaborated on their design. [...] "These planes are not real life models. You might see some part of them [...] familiar, but these are whole new concepts". Petrekovits further clarified that though the planes can be equipped with weaponry via powerups, they [...] "are not military planes whatsoever, [...] <b>are</b> <b>racing</b> planes." [...] Two members of the game's development team were graduate airplane technicians.|$|E

This is who we are." [...] Mike Drucker from IGN called the second season a combination of the [...] "X-Files and the violent paranoia of Se7en." [...] Variety reviewer Jeremy Gerard compared the show to Twin Peaks and was overall positive to the series, but said [...] "I just wish it were a little more fun, that I didn't have this nagging feeling that it wants to hurt me the next time I come around." [...] Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly gave the show a B and said it had [...] "great visuals and a commanding performance by Henriksen." [...] Justine Elias from The New York Times was mostly positive to the series and said [...] "If The X-Files, with its offbeat humor and conspiracy theories, wonders about those things that go bump in the night, Millennium explores the darkness – and embraces it." [...] Daily Nebraskan said in their review that the show had [...] "a lot of potential: a good lead actor, a solid premise and a feel that will keep audiences glued to their televisions." ...|$|E
2500|$|...Generally {{speaking}} the [...] "Old School" [...] generation is from 1969, {{the very beginning}} of BMX to 1987 or 1988, during the first major slump in the popularity of BMX racing and the height of popularity of Old School Freestyling. [...] "Mid School" [...] is generally considered to be from 1988 to 1999, which includes the first slump in Freestyle BMX in 1988-89 and the resurgence of BMX racing beginning in 1990 and it really taking off again in 1993. [...] "New/Current School" [...] or today's BMX is considered to be from 2000 to the present day with the emphasis on Dirt Jumping contest and streetstyle and deemphasis on racing. With the racers, it will not be perfect demarcations. Some Old Schoolers raced well into the Mid School era of the 1990s, like Pete Loncarevich and Greg Hill. There are a few Old Schoolers still racing in the Veteran and Masters classes today, Eric Rupe to name one. Many Mid Schoolers like Warwick Stevenson and Randy Stumpfhauser <b>are</b> <b>racing</b> well into the New/Current School era. A significant number of top New Schoolers started during the [...] "Mid school" [...] era like Donny Robinson and Bubba Harris, so there is bleed over. As time goes by the year definitions of eras of [...] "Mid" [...] and [...] "New School" [...] will change, especially Mid School, but [...] "Old School" [...] will most likely always refer to the sports first 18–19 years when the pioneers began it, set the rules, promoted it, constructed the precedent setting equipment, set the records and conventions, raced it, and largely retired from it in terms of serious Senior Pro competition.|$|E
