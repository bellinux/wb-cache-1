The tractor {{hydraulic}} hitch {{system is}} an important subsystem of modern <b>agricultural</b> tractor <b>work</b> <b>unit.</b> Its main function is to hook and control agricultural machines working position. The hydraulic hitch system {{is an important}} part of modern <b>agricultural</b> tractor <b>work</b> <b>unit.</b> The research on the hydraulic hitch system control method, is the basis of ensuring that the tractor <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> reach the optimal performance. This paper analyzes the tractor hitch control function, introduces the principle of electro-hydraulic control of tractor ploughing depth, and the tractor mechanical hydraulic hitch equipment as the basis, using electric hydraulic control to replace the original mechanical hydraulic control, improved design of automatic control system. The novel electro-hydraulic hitch system having multiple parameter stability comprehensive regulation performance, can replace the traditional mechanical type regulating device, to achieve depth homogeneous, stable work...|$|R
40|$|The global {{debate on}} food {{security}} {{and the kinds of}} farming systems that could prove economically and ecologically sustainable has focused overwhelmingly on small family farms versus large commercial farms, with little attention to alternative models based on farmer cooperation. France offers a significant but internationally little recognised (and under-researched) model of group farming—the GAEC (Groupement Agricoles d’Exploitation en Commun) —based on farmers pooling land, labour and capital. This model is of considerable contemporary interest for both France and other countries. Catalysed by a 1962 law, GAECs accounted for 7. 6 % of farms and 15 % of <b>agricultural</b> adult <b>work</b> <b>units</b> in 2010, but their incidence varied greatly across regions. Using data from the French agricultural census and other sources, this paper identifies the factors (economic, ecological, social and demographic) underlying this regional variation of GAECs (and comparatively of EARLs—Exploitations Agricoles à Responsabilité Limitée—another type of group farm introduced in 1985). Regions with a higher incidence of group farms are found to be those with greater economic equality, local ecology favouring labour-intensive animal breeding, social institutions that promote community cohesion, and higher proportions of agricultural graduates, among other factors. The paper not only illuminates the contexts favourable to the emergence of group farming in France, but also points to the conditions under which farmer cooperation could take root elsewhere, thus breaking new ground on an issue of substantial policy relevance...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{this paper}} is to introduce the agricultural ergonomics and to show the importance of it in improving the <b>agricultural</b> <b>works.</b> Background: Despite of rapid advancement of technologies and adoption of modern mechanical equipments at farms in Korea, most of <b>agricultural</b> <b>works</b> have still remained manual and thus have {{regarded as one of the}} hardest works. With aging and feminization in rural areas, the need to improve <b>agricultural</b> <b>works</b> has grown quite much. Agricultural ergonomics have been known as a good tool in improving <b>agricultural</b> <b>works</b> around the world. Recently Korean government initiated a national program of providing assistive equipments to help farmers and a few ergonomists started to apply agricultural ergonomics in our rural villages as a part of this program. Method: This study reviewed how Ergonomics was used for the <b>agricultural</b> <b>work.</b> Results: Methods of Ergonomics which are used for the agricultural ergonomics and the simple procedure of the agricultural ergonomics were presented.

This definition, based on three fundamental spiritual needs, has implications for how leaders can enhance <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> performance by nurturing the spirit at work. In an exploratory study of six <b>work</b> <b>units</b> in a large hospital system we used an instrument that measures workplace spirituality.

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} diversity within organizations, understanding {{the impact of}} ethnic differences in <b>work</b> <b>units</b> has become a strategic imperative. Although the topic of much research, findings regarding the effect of <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> ethnic composition on <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> outcomes are inconsistent. I begin to address inconsistencies in the literature by incorporating the role of two moderators of intergroup contact, status and cooperation (Allport, 1954), into ethnic composition research. First, I introduce the construct of ethnic status, which reflects the degree of status ascribed to individuals based on ethnic group membership, and predict that <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> ethnic status separation (ESS) will negatively impact <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> processes (conflict, cohesion, trust) and performance (financial, manager-rated, citizenship behaviors). Second, I theorize that elements of the <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> (learning climate, performance climate) and community (ethnic composition, economics, political climate) context will moderate <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> ethnic composition effects, such that cooperative contexts ameliorate, but competitive contexts exacerbate, the negative relationship between <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> ESS and unit-level outcomes. In Study 1, I developed a measure of ethnic status and found support for the stability and validity of ethnic status in both student and adult samples. In Study 2, I used the status measure to calculate <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> composition (i. e., ESS). I then tested the interaction of <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> ESS with elements of the <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> and community context {{as a predictor of}} unit-level outcomes in a sample of 703 employees of a large bank, who were nested within 121 geographically dispersed <b>work</b> <b>units</b> (i. e., branches). To assess community contexts, I supplemented the bank sample with data from the United States Census. At the <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> level, I found that high ESS <b>work</b> <b>units</b> experienced less conflict and better financial performance in high learning climates than in low learning climates. At the community level, I found that the negative outcomes of <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> ESS, including high conflict, low cohesion and trust, and poor financial performance, were most severe in communities similarly characterized by high ESS. Results for the remaining <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> (performance climate) and community (economics, political climate) context factors were mixed. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{influence}} of the understanding of accounting system, government financial management and work environment on the performance of <b>work</b> <b>units</b> (a study in Regional Ministry Departments/ <b>Work</b> <b>Units</b> in Keerom Regency).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Decomposing authoritarian {{leadership}} {{into two}} essential elements - authoritarian {{decision making and}} authoritarian decision implementation, this dissertation focuses on disentangling the relationship between authoritarian leadership and <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> effectiveness, the relationship that has confused leadership researchers for decades. Surveys from 376 employees of 114 <b>work</b> <b>units</b> in a Chinese Fast Moving Consumer Goods company show four important findings. First, authoritarian decision making and authoritarian decision implementation are theoretically and empirically two distinct constructs. Second, leader authoritarian decision making interacts with both leader authoritarian decision implementation and leader competence to affect <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> decision quality. Moreover, leader authoritarian decision implementation partially moderates the relationship between <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> decision quality and <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> effectiveness. Finally, leader authoritarian decision making has an indirect effect on <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> effectiveness through its impact on <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> decision quality only when leader authoritarian decision implementation is low.
