5|$|<b>Allied</b> naval commanders {{decided to}} use battleships to conduct a series of attacks against Japanese coastal cities in mid-1945. It was hoped that the Japanese {{military}} would respond to these bombardments by attacking the <b>Allied</b> forces with the aircraft that were being held in reserve {{to respond to the}} planned invasion of Japan, thereby exposing these aircraft to destruction by <b>Allied</b> fighter aircraft. However, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters had anticipated that the Allies would conduct bombardments and other operations with this goal, and decided to not attack naval forces operating off Japan. Instead, the aircraft would remain in reserve until <b>Allied</b> landing operations in the home islands began.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>Allied</b> concerns, Tirpitz posed only {{a limited}} danger to <b>Allied</b> shipping. From late 1943 the {{battleship}} was unable to put to sea for crew training due {{to the threat of}} <b>Allied</b> attack and fuel shortages. These shortages also meant the Germans were unable to move the battleship between anchorages to make her more difficult to locate and attack.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Ally</b> sees Walker and {{recognises}} him as [...] "Nick" [...] {{from the}} army. Walker tells <b>Ally</b> he is mistaken. Walker threatens <b>Ally</b> {{not to reveal}} their past history to anyone, which Lynsey Nolan witnesses. Lynsey decides to investigate <b>Ally</b> and follows him to a strip club. Lynsey confronts <b>Ally</b> and they argue when she threatens to tell Amy. Ste overhears them arguing and decides to tell Amy. Lynsey is later found dead. Ste tells Amy about <b>Ally</b> and Lynsey's argument. <b>Ally</b> and Lynsey's argument was witnessed and the police question <b>Ally</b> about Lynsey's death. Amy provides an alibi for <b>Ally,</b> telling the police that they were together at the time Lynsey was murdered. <b>Ally</b> tells Amy {{he was at a}} strip club when Lynsey was murdered. <b>Ally</b> explains that he visits strip clubs to look out for the strippers, as his sister was a stripper and was raped by two customers. A stripper at the club verifies <b>Ally's</b> story to Amy and Ste. Amy tells <b>Ally</b> she cannot trust him and leaves. <b>Ally</b> then pays the stripper for covering for him. When Will Savage (James Atherton) is accused of being Lynsey's murderer, <b>Ally</b> leads a hate campaign against him. <b>Ally</b> befriends Ash Kane (Holly Weston) and they both help prove Will's innocence. <b>Ally</b> and Ash later share a kiss. <b>Ally</b> tells Amy about the kiss, explaining that he suffers from Post traumatic stress disorder and was having a panic attack when the kiss happened. <b>Ally</b> then ends his relationship with Amy and moves out. Ash allows <b>Ally</b> to stay with her. He then later sustains a relationship with Ash, and this angers Amy- so soon after they separated.|$|R

Amy tells <b>Ally</b> that their relationship is moving to fast and he leaves for the night. The next day, <b>Ally</b> attempts to reunite with Amy, unaware that she has had a one-night stand with Dodger. Amy refuses, and goes on a road trip to forget about her problems. Amy is unaware that Dodger's cousin, Dennis Savage (Joe Tracini), has invited both Dodger and <b>Ally</b> on the trip. Dennis hopes to reconcile <b>Ally</b> and Amy. <b>Ally</b> learns that Amy and Dodger had sex, and attacks Dodger. <b>Ally</b> refuses to forgive Amy {{and returns to the}} village. <b>Ally</b> and Amy later reunite.|$|R
5|$|From the 1950s to 2003, the Strategic Commanders {{were the}} Supreme <b>Allied</b> Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the Supreme <b>Allied</b> Commander Atlantic (SACLANT). The current {{arrangement}} is to separate responsibility between <b>Allied</b> Command Transformation (ACT), responsible for transformation {{and training of}} NATO forces, and <b>Allied</b> Command Operations (ACO), responsible for NATO operations worldwide. Starting in late 2003 NATO has restructured how it commands and deploys its troops by creating several NATO Rapid Deployable Corps, including Eurocorps, I.

5|$|From {{the time}} of the battle until several months later, almost all <b>Allied</b> {{supplies}} and reinforcements sent to Guadalcanal came by transports in small convoys, mainly during daylight hours, while <b>Allied</b> aircraft from the New Hebrides and Henderson Field and any available aircraft carriers flew covering missions. During this time, <b>Allied</b> forces on Guadalcanal received barely enough ammunition and provisions to withstand the several Japanese drives to retake the islands.|$|E
5|$|General Douglas MacArthur was {{appointed}} as the Supreme Commander, Southwest Pacific Area, on its creation on 18 April 1942. He created five subordinate commands: <b>Allied</b> Land Forces, <b>Allied</b> Air Forces, <b>Allied</b> Naval Forces, United States Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA), and the United States Army Forces in the Philippines. The last command disappeared when Corregidor surrendered on 6 May 1942, while USAFIA became the United States Army Services of Supply, Southwest Pacific Area (USASOS SWPA). In 1943, United States Army Forces in the Far East was reformed and assumed responsibility for administration, leaving USASOS as a purely logistical agency. Both were swept {{away in a}} reorganisation in 1945. The other three commands, <b>Allied</b> Land Forces, <b>Allied</b> Air Forces and <b>Allied</b> Naval Forces, remained until SWPA was abolished on 2 September 1945.|$|E

Jacqui and Rhys' new lodger, Phoebe Jackson (Mandip Gill), steals <b>Ally's</b> laptop and Jacqui refuses to report Phoebe to the police. Jacqui and Rhys pay <b>Ally</b> the amount the laptop was worth and he moves out. <b>Ally</b> asks Amy out on a date before returning to the army.|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} to the <b>Allied</b> landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial Japanese Army's 17th Army, a corps-sized command based at Rabaul and {{under the command of}} Lieutenant-General Harukichi Hyakutake, with the task of retaking Guadalcanal from <b>Allied</b> forces. Beginning on 19 August, various units of the 17th Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal with the goal of driving <b>Allied</b> forces from the island.|$|E

5|$|On 1 January, the Japanese {{military}} {{changed their}} radio communication codes, {{making it more}} difficult for <b>Allied</b> intelligence, which had heretofore partially broken Japanese radio ciphers, to divine Japanese intentions and movement. As January progressed, <b>Allied</b> reconnaissance and radio traffic analysis noted the buildup of ships and aircraft at Truk, Rabaul, and the Shortland Islands. <b>Allied</b> analysts determined that the increased radio traffic in the Marshalls was a deception meant to divert attention from an operation about to take place in either New Guinea or the Solomons. <b>Allied</b> intelligence personnel, however, misinterpreted the nature of the operation. On 26 January, the <b>Allied</b> Pacific Command's intelligence section informed <b>Allied</b> forces in the Pacific that the Japanese were preparing for a new offensive, called Ke, in either the Solomons or New Guinea.|$|E

5|$|On 18 April 1942, MacArthur was {{appointed}} Supreme Commander of <b>Allied</b> Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA). Lieutenant General George Brett became Commander, <b>Allied</b> Air Forces, and Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary became Commander, <b>Allied</b> Naval Forces. Since {{the bulk of}} land forces in the theater were Australian, George Marshall insisted an Australian be appointed as Commander, <b>Allied</b> Land Forces, and the job went to General Sir Thomas Blamey. Although predominantly Australian and American, MacArthur's command also included small numbers of personnel from the Netherlands East Indies, the United Kingdom, and other countries.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{occupiers}} chiefly came in {{the form}} of helping <b>Allied</b> airmen escape, and numerous lines were set up to organise this effort; for instance the Comet line which evacuated an estimated 700 <b>Allied</b> servicemen to Gibraltar. The Comet Line had a series of safe houses throughout Belgium. <b>Allied</b> airmen were given civilian clothes and were frequently moved from house to house, staying with Belgian families who supported the resistance. The resistance would aid the airmen by giving them false papers and guiding them to either neutral or <b>Allied</b> occupied territory.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Arawe (also {{known as}} Operation Director) was fought between <b>Allied</b> and Japanese forces during the New Britain Campaign of World War II. The battle formed {{part of the}} <b>Allied</b> Operation Cartwheel, and had the {{objective}} of serving as a diversion before a larger landing at Cape Gloucester in late December 1943. The Japanese military was expecting an <b>Allied</b> offensive in western New Britain, and was reinforcing the region {{at the time of}} the <b>Allied</b> landing in the Arawe area on 15December 1943. The Allies secured Arawe after about a month of intermittent fighting with the outnumbered Japanese force.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} soon devolved into man-on-man combat; Seydlitz himself fought like a trooper, {{receiving a}} severe wound. He ordered his last 18 squadrons, still {{waiting at the}} Janus, into the fray. The second charge struck the French cavalry at an oblique angle. The mêlée drifted rapidly southward, past the <b>Allied</b> infantry. Part of the <b>Allied</b> reserve, which had become entangled between the main columns, was extricating itself by degrees and endeavoring {{to catch up with}} the rest of the reserve column away to the right, but the sweep of horses and <b>Allied</b> infantry pulled them into the fighting. The <b>Allied</b> reserve artillery proved useless; caught in the middle of the infantry columns, it could not deploy to support any of the endangered <b>Allied</b> troops. The Prussian infantry on the Shartau hill waited in echelon from the left. Those <b>Allied</b> units who escaped the artillery and the horsemen ran headlong into a hail of musket fire from Prince Henry's infantry. Attempted French counterattacks dissolved into confusion. Most of the <b>Allied</b> cavalry units in front were smashed by the initial charge and many of them trampled over their own men trying to flee. The field was littered with riderless horses and horseless men, wounded, dying and dead. This part of the action took about 30 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} {{began in}} spring 480 BC, when the Persian army crossed the Hellespont and marched through Thrace and Macedon to Thessaly.

At the famous Battle of Thermopylae, the <b>Allied</b> army held back the Persian army for seven days, before they were outflanked by a mountain path and the <b>Allied</b> rearguard was trapped and annihilated.
