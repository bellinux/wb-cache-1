5|$|The {{derivative}} of a function can, in principle, be computed from the definition {{by considering the}} difference quotient, and computing its limit.

5|$|According to {{inclusive}} fitness theory, organisms {{can gain}} fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output, {{but also that}} of close relatives. In evolutionary terms, individuals should help relatives when Cost < Relatedness * Benefit.

5|$|Sirius can be {{observed}} in daylight with the naked eye under the right conditions. Ideally, the sky should be very clear, with the observer at a high altitude, the star passing overhead, and the Sun low down on the horizon. These observing conditions <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> met in the southern hemisphere, due to the southerly declination of Sirius.|$|E
5|$|Zebras and {{wildebeest}} group {{together in}} open savannah environments with high chances of predation. This grouping strategy reduces predation risk because larger groups decrease each individual’s {{chance of being}} hunted, and predators <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> seen in open areas. The seasonal presence of thousands of migratory wildebeests reduces local lion predation on giraffe calves, resulting in greater survival of giraffes.|$|E
5|$|DX arrays {{have been}} made to form hollow {{nanotubes}} 4–20nm in diameter, essentially two-dimensional lattices which curve back upon themselves. These DNA nanotubes are somewhat similar in size and shape to carbon nanotubes, and while they lack the electrical conductance of carbon nanotubes, DNA nanotubes <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> modified and connected to other structures. One of many schemes for constructing DNA nanotubes uses a lattice of curved DX tiles that curls around itself and closes into a tube. In an alternative method that allows the circumference to be specified in a simple, modular fashion using single-stranded tiles, the rigidity of the tube is an emergent property.|$|E

5|$|The {{surrounding}} valley formed {{because of}} a swell in the underlying rock of the Colorado Plateau that caused the regional elevation to intersect the Chinle and Moenkopi Formations, deposited in the Triassic about 208–245 million years ago. This area contains sandstone, siltstone, shale and limestone formed by the sediments on ancient seabeds and later alluvial deposits made by the Colorado and Paria Rivers. Because these <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> eroded than the rock layers that lie above and below them, the Colorado Plateau gradually slopes down to river level at Lees Ferry {{through a series of}} flat benchlands.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{woodpeckers}} are arboreal {{birds of}} wooded habitats. They reach their greatest diversity in tropical rainforests, but occur {{in almost all}} suitable habitats including woodlands, savannahs, scrublands, and bamboo forests. Even grasslands and deserts have been colonised by various species. These habitats <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> occupied where {{a small number of}} trees exist, or, in the case of desert species like the Gila woodpecker, tall cacti are available for nesting. Some are specialists and are associated with coniferous or deciduous woodland or even, like the acorn woodpecker, with individual tree genera (oaks in this case). Other species are generalists and are able to adapt to forest clearance by exploiting secondary growth, plantations, orchards and parks. In general, forest-dwelling species need rotting or dead wood on which to forage.|$|E
5|$|The American white ibis {{prefers to}} eat {{crayfish}} and other crustaceans, but also takes aquatic insects and small fish. Outside the nesting season, the diet is highly variable, as abundance {{and types of}} prey depend on the both region and habitat. In Los Llanos, located {{on the border of}} Colombia and Venezuela, the most frequent prey are insects, such as fly larvae and beetles. Generally in North America the main prey are crustaceans, mostly crayfish. In the Everglades and cypress swamps, the diet is primarily made up of crayfish, while those that feed in willow ponds eat predominantly fish. American white ibises that feed in mangrove swamps focus on crabs. The tactile nature of the ibis's probing for food in mud means that it catches prey that are too slow to evade the ibis once located by its bill. In the Everglades, this means that crayfish make up {{a large part of the}} diet, but a more diverse array of invertebrates are taken in coastal areas. Although crayfish are sought by foraging ibises, prey switching to fish does occur if fish are found in great abundance. It is unclear whether the fish <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> caught if overcrowded, or whether sheer numbers of fish mean that ibises are catching them instead of crayfish—normally, fish are more agile than crayfish and hence elude the ibis's bill more easily. Fish are a more energy-rich source of food for the American white ibis. In the breeding season, American white ibises in a colony at Pumpkinseed Island travelled further to forage in freshwater wetlands and catch crayfish, than nearby saltwater areas where fiddler crabs predominated, indicating their benefit was worth the extra energy expended in fetching them for their young. This travel results in the wholesale transport of nutrients across the landscape by the colony; in a successful breeding year the colony at Pumpkinseed Island was estimated to have contributed a third as much phosphorus to the neighboring estuary as other environmental processes.|$|E
