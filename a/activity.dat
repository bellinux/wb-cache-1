A finding of reduced dopamine-related <b>activity</b> in the basal ganglia can rule out drug-induced parkinsonism, but reduced basal ganglia dopamine-related <b>activity</b> is seen in both PD and the Parkinson-plus disorders so these scans are not reliable in distinguishing PD from other neurodegenerative causes of parkinsonism.|$|E

This includes entertainment (such as watching TV, listening music/radio, reading magazines/newspapers and accessing the Internet), social and family <b>activities</b> (such as meeting with family members and friends, visiting relatives/friends and undertaking sport, leisure, and voluntary <b>activities</b> and going on holiday).

5|$|In archaea, the Rrp41 subunit of {{the complex}} is a phosphorolytic exoribonuclease. Three copies of this protein {{are present in the}} ring and are {{responsible}} for the <b>activity</b> {{of the complex}}. In eukaryotes, none of the RNase PH subunits have retained this catalytic <b>activity,</b> meaning the core ring structure of the human exosome has no enzymatically active protein. Despite this loss of catalytic <b>activity,</b> the structure of the core exosome is highly conserved from archea to humans, suggesting that the complex performs a vital cellular function. In eukaryotes, the absence of the phosphorolytic <b>activity</b> is compensated by the presence of the hydrolytic enzymes, which are responsible for the ribonuclease <b>activity</b> of the exosome in such organisms.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} how the {{described}} genetic defects increase the Na+/K+-ATPase <b>activity,</b> but it is suspected that the enzyme becomes more active due to increased thyroid hormone levels. Hyperthyroidism increases the levels of catecholamines (such as adrenaline) in the blood, increasing Na+/K+-ATPase <b>activity.</b> The enzyme <b>activity</b> is then increased further by the precipitating causes. For instance, increased carbohydrate intake leads to increased insulin levels; this is known to activate Na+/K+-ATPase. Once the precipitant is removed, the enzyme <b>activity</b> returns to normal levels. It has been postulated that male hormones increase Na+/K+-ATPase <b>activity,</b> and that this explains why males are at a higher risk of TPP despite thyroid disease being more common in females.|$|E

5|$|Tikal {{as a whole}} {{went into}} general decline during the Terminal Classic, with {{some parts of the}} city {{apparently}} being abandoned. The Mundo Perdido, however, continued to be a centre of vigorous ceremonial <b>activity.</b> Evidence of this continued <b>activity</b> in the complex includes burials and collections of ceramic and lithic artefacts, together with significant construction <b>activity.</b> The main Late Classic structures were fitted with new benches and a change to access routes to the complex took place. <b>Activity</b> was concentrated in the northern portion of the Mundo Perdido, perhaps because it was closest to the Temple Reservoir water supply. Some minor changes were made to the Talud-Tablero Temple at this time. The greatest residential <b>activity</b> during the Terminal Classic took place in the vaulted palace immediately to the east of the Talud-Tablero Temple (Structures 5C-45 through to 5C-47). This <b>activity</b> included complex construction projects and indicates that the elite were still in residence immediately prior to the complete abandonment of the city. Further construction <b>activity,</b> in the form of structural strengthening, also took place in other structures in the northern sector, including Structures 5D-77 and 5D-82. Ritual <b>activity</b> also continued, and the bottom half of Early Classic Stela 39 was placed in Temple 5D-86 on the East Platform and worshipped.|$|E
25|$|Next to evoked <b>activity,</b> neural <b>activity</b> {{related to}} {{stimulus}} processing {{may result in}} induced <b>activity.</b> Induced <b>activity</b> refers to modulation in ongoing brain <b>activity</b> induced by processing of stimuli or movement preparation. Hence, they reflect an indirect response in contrast to evoked responses. A well-studied type of induced <b>activity</b> is amplitude change in oscillatory <b>activity.</b> For instance, gamma <b>activity</b> often increases during increased mental <b>activity</b> such as during object representation. Because induced responses may have different phases across measurements and therefore would cancel out during averaging, they can only be obtained using time-frequency analysis. Induced <b>activity</b> generally reflects the <b>activity</b> of numerous neurons: amplitude changes in oscillatory <b>activity</b> are thought to arise from the synchronization of neural <b>activity,</b> for instance by synchronization of spike timing or membrane potential fluctuations of individual neurons. Increases in oscillatory <b>activity</b> are therefore {{often referred to as}} event-related synchronization, while decreases are referred to as event-related desynchronization.|$|E
25|$|Both single neurons {{and groups}} of neurons can {{generate}} oscillatory <b>activity</b> spontaneously. In addition, they may show oscillatory responses to perceptual input or motor output. Some types of neurons will fire rhythmically {{in the absence of}} any synaptic input. Likewise, brain-wide <b>activity</b> reveals oscillatory <b>activity</b> while subjects do not engage in any <b>activity,</b> so-called resting-state <b>activity.</b> These ongoing rhythms can change in different ways in response to perceptual input or motor output. Oscillatory <b>activity</b> may respond by increases or decreases in frequency and amplitude or show a temporary interruption, which is referred to as phase resetting. In addition, external <b>activity</b> may not interact with ongoing <b>activity</b> at all, resulting in an additive response.|$|E
