5|$|While in {{recording}} sessions, Martella has a {{large amount}} of enthusiasm and describes it as humorous to watch him while doing a take. In interviews Martella has said that he enjoys working on the series and voicing Phineas, and <b>appreciates</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to work alongside guest stars, especially Malcolm McDowell.|$|E
5|$|Similarly he is irreligious, {{his work}} making him {{aware of the}} {{fragility}} of life and consciousness's reliance on the functioning brain. His morality is nuanced, weighing both sides of an issue. When leaving the confrontation with Baxter, he questions his use of his medical knowledge, {{even though it was}} in self-defense, and with genuine Hippocratic feeling. While shopping for his fish supper, he cites scientific research that shows greater consciousness in fish, and wonders whether he should stop eating them. As a sign of his rationalism, he <b>appreciates</b> <b>the</b> brutality of Saddam Hussein's rule as described by the Iraqi professor whom Perowne treated, at the same time taking seriously his children's concerns about the war.|$|E
5|$|When {{a warrior}} is so old, or sustains an injury {{that means they}} can no longer serve their Clan, they retire to become elders. Elders live out the {{remainder}} of their life in general peace, using it as a time of rest and relaxation. They sleep in their own separate den, which is looked after by the apprentices. Elders are not expected to hunt or fight for their Clan, but are able to do so if the mood takes them. Their only expected duty is to carry the body of a deceased Clanmate to their grave. Every cat of the Clan respects and <b>appreciates</b> <b>the</b> elders, thanking them for the time they have spent upholding their roles as a warrior. Sadly, it is rare for a Clan to have more than three or four elders, as many warriors die before they can retire.|$|E

They <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> dancing, undoubtedly, though {{very few of}} them would condescend to join. They <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> plum-duff and the greasy cakes highly, and they more than <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> tea--especially the women--which MacSweenie took care to provide hot, strong, and sweet. But {{there is no doubt that}} the lion of the evening was--the [...] "fuddle." ...|$|R
50|$|The U350 was {{released}} in July 2009 to mixed reviews from different publications. LAPTOP Magazine <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> laptop’s design and low starting price, but was disappointed by the low battery life. Computer Shopper discounted the laptop’s performance but <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> light weight and affordable price. Stark Insider <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> laptop’s price, performance, keyboard, display and speakers. The negative points noted were the fan noise and heat on the left palm rest.|$|R
50|$|Japanese {{video game}} {{magazine}} Famitsu gave the game {{a score of}} 27/40 in a cross review by four reviewers.

5|$|Core Design's Fighting Force (1997) was {{anticipated}} {{to redefine the}} genre for 32-bit consoles through its use of a 3D environment. However, it was met with a lukewarm reception. The Dynasty Warriors series, beginning with Dynasty Warriors 2 in 2000, offered traditional beat 'em up action on large 3D battlefields, displaying dozens of characters on the screen at a time. The series to date spans 14 games (including expansions) which players in the West view as overly similar, although the games' creators claim their large audience in Japan <b>appreciates</b> <b>the</b> subtle differences between the titles. While critics saw Dynasty Warriors 2 as innovative and technically impressive, they held a mixed opinion of later titles. These later games received praise for simple, enjoyable gameplay but were simultaneously derided as overly simplistic and repetitive. Another best-selling Japanese series, Yakuza, combined elaborate plots and detailed interactive environments with street brawling action. Despite these releases, game reviewers started to pronounce that the genre had died off. By 2002, there were virtually no new beat 'em ups being released in arcades.|$|E

25|$|On {{return to}} the Sub, however, Gold-Eye has a vision in which he sees Drum being stored {{temporarily}} in the Meat Factory, indicating that Drum is still alive. The group presents the device to Shade, who <b>appreciates</b> <b>the</b> Overlord device Ninde took from Fort Robertson but refuses a request to rescue Drum, as the Meat Factory {{is one of the}} most heavily guarded Overlord facilities.|$|E
25|$|Dayna Mellanby, {{played by}} Josette Simon (series 3–4). The {{daughter}} of former dissident Hal Mellanby, Dayna {{is an expert}} in weapons technology. She is adept at designing mechanized weapons, but also <b>appreciates</b> <b>the</b> nobility of what she describes as more 'primitive' combat. Brave and loyal, but at times reckless and naïve, she often successfully challenges men who are supposedly accomplished fighters. Her vendetta against Servalan (who murdered her father) motivates her to endorse Avon's fighting of the Federation.|$|E

25|$|She {{obtained}} Mexican citizenship after marrying the Mexican Roberto Madrigal Hernández, who is {{also her}} coach. She has two daughters, Yadira and Angelica Madrigal Silva, and lives with her family in the Mexican city of Villahermosa, Tabasco. Silva considers herself a housewife who still prepares Cuban food, but has been taught Mexican cuisine by her mother-in-law. Silva has confessed that leaving her daughters is the toughest thing for her, even when her mother Bárbara Llorente takes care of them. She considers her mom an example and <b>appreciates</b> <b>the</b> great deal of support she gives her.|$|E
25|$|Chan {{created his}} screen persona as a {{response}} to the late Bruce Lee and the numerous imitators who appeared before and after Lee's death. Lee's characters were typically stern, morally upright heroes. In contrast, Chan plays well-meaning, slightly foolish regular men, often at the mercy of their friends, girlfriends, or families, who always triumph in the end despite the odds. Additionally, he has stated that he deliberately styles his movement to be the opposite of Lee's: where Lee held his arms wide, Chan holds his tight to the body; where Lee was loose and flowing, Chan is tight and choppy. Despite the success of the Rush Hour series, Chan has stated that he is not a fan of it, since he neither <b>appreciates</b> <b>the</b> action scenes in the movie nor understands American humour.|$|E
25|$|Their {{influence}} certainly existed but it {{is difficult}} to define in its totality. Writers who followed them doubtlessly thought about them while they were creating their dark and tormented worlds such as Thomas Hardy in Jude the Obscure or Tess of the d'Urbervilles, or George Eliot with Adam Bede and The Mill on the Floss. There were also more conventional authors such as Matthew Arnold, who in a letter from 1853, says of Charlotte, that she only pretends to heartless: ' nothing but hunger, rebellion and rage'. In contrast, Mrs Humphry Ward, author of Robert Elsmere and morality novels, only finds didactic among the works of Charlotte, while she <b>appreciates</b> <b>the</b> happy blend of romance and realism in the works of Emily. There is however nothing that could constitute a literary vein.|$|E

25|$|This {{story begins}} with a {{conversation}} between an old man and a young traveler, Tomás Gomez. The older man explains that he came to Mars because he <b>appreciates</b> <b>the</b> new and novel. Even everyday things have become amazing to him once again. He has returned full circle to his childhood. Later, Tomás encounters a Martian named Muhe Ca. Each can see the Mars he is accustomed to, {{in his own time}} frame, but the other person is translucent to him and has the appearance of a phantom. The young man sees ruins where the Martian sees a thriving city, while the Martian sees an ocean where Tomás sees the new Earth settlement. Neither knows if he precedes the other in time, but Bradbury makes the point that any one civilization is ultimately fleeting.|$|E
25|$|Martin {{provides}} {{a variety of}} female characters to explore some of the ramifications of the novels being set in a patriarchal society. Martin says that he wrote all characters as human beings with the same basic needs, dreams and influences, and that his female characters are to cover the same wide spectrum of human traits like the males. Martin claims to identify with all point-of-view characters {{in the writing process}} despite significant differences to him, be it gender or age. He sees himself neither as misogynistic or a promoter of feminism, although he acknowledged that some values inoculated within childhood can never be fully abandoned, even those consciously rejected. He says that he <b>appreciates</b> <b>the</b> discussions whether the series is feminist or anti-feminist, and is very gratified of the many female readers and how much they like {{at least some of the}} female characters. He says that he does not presume to make feminist statements in either way. Martin's books frequently depict and refer to rape and humiliation, most cases of which are perpetrated upon women.|$|E
25|$|A very {{favorite}} {{style of}} chip pattern is that formed by small triangles and squares entirely covering a {{surface in the}} Cook Islands, the monotony being sometimes varied by a band of different arrangement {{in the middle of}} the article or at the top or bottom. So far as the cultivation of patience and accuracy is concerned, has no equal. The Fiji Islanders, employ chip designs rivaling those of Europe in variety. Upon occasion the aboriginal Marquesas carver <b>appreciates</b> <b>the</b> way in which plain surfaces contrast and emphasize decorated parts, and judiciously restricts his skill to bands of decoration or to special points. The Ijos of the lower Niger design their paddles in a masterly way, and show a fine sense of proportion between the plain and the decorated surface. Their designs, though slightly in relief, are of the chip nature. The method of decorating a subject with groups of incised lines, straight or curved, though often very effective and in every way suitable, is not a very advanced form of art and has decided limits. The natives of the Congo, now two nations, covered by the landmass of the Republic of the Congo and Democratic Republic of the Congo does good work of this kind.|$|E

Responding to concerns about length and overstatement, they reply, [...] "that's precisely {{the point of}} this album, and is also why it works so well. No other rock 'n' roller besides Meat Loaf could pull off the humor and theatricality of Back Into Hell and make it seem real. In that sense, it's a worthy successor to the original." ...|$|E

[...] The story ends with Wooden Leg {{an old man who}} is increasingly unable to farm his land.

500|$|Read by all ages, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is {{targeted}} at a teenage audience. The book addresses {{a range of}} themes dispassionately. These themes include drugs, friendship, body image, first love, suicide, eating disorders and sexuality. Chbosky <b>appreciates</b> <b>the</b> importance of entertainment in adolescence: [...] "Books, songs, and movies are more than entertainment when we're young. They help all of us discover who we are, what we believe, and what we hope our life can be." [...] As such, the book contains several cultural references across all mediums: musically the book references The Smiths and Fleetwood Mac, literarily the book references This Side of Paradise, On the Road, To Kill a Mockingbird and theatrically the book references The Rocky Horror Picture Show.|$|E
