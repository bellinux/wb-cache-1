The same procedure involving virgin steel in steel trade and mass production of steel objects gave no such evidence, even though no final conclusions can be drawn because of the low number of samples analyzed. Low dioxin exposures during inert gas electric arc welding confirm previous literature findings, whereas soldering and thermal <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> in the presence of polyvinyl chloride give rise to concern. The consequences of occupational dioxin exposure were studied by analysis of the dioxin-blood concentration, the body burden, of men performing thermal <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> at scrap metal reclamation and demolition sites, in steel trade and producing plants as well as for industrial welders and white-collar workers. The results concerning body burdens are in excellent agreement with the dioxin exposure as characterized by dioxin air concentration in the workplace. The significant positive correlation between duration and frequency of performing thermal <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> at metal reclamation and demolition sites expressed in job-years and dioxin body burden speaks for the occupational origin of the observed overload after long times.

From the analysis of the developed mathematical models it was observed that functional dependence between laser cutting parameters, their interactions and surface roughness characteristics is complex and non-linear.

40|$|Experimental {{observations}} on the plasma dynamics inside the nozzle of a 30 A <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> torch operated at conditions close to the double arcing are reported. It is employed a technique previously developed in our laboratory consisting in using the nozzle as a large-sized Langmuir probe. Based {{on the behavior of}} the ion current signal and simple estimations, it is concluded that (1) the non-equilibrium plasma inside the nozzle is far from the steady state in time, in contrast to what is frequently assumed. The power supply ripple was identified as the main fluctuations source and (2) large-scale plasma fluctuations inside the nozzle could cause transient (total duration of the order of 100 μs) Townsend avalanches developing in the space-charge layer located between the arc plasma and the nozzle wall. Such events trigger the so called non-destructive double-arcing phenomena without appealing to the presence of insulating films deposited inside the nozzle orifice, as was previously proposed in the literature. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} comparing non-traditional cutting technologies {{from the point}} of view of generated surface roughness. The comparison is carried out for technologies of abrasive waterjet <b>cutting,</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting,</b> laser and plasma cutting.

Surface topography measurement was done using a Mitutoyo Surftest SJ- 401 instrument, and an optical profilometer MicroProf FRT was used for comparison and verification of acquired surface data. The aim of the contribution is to clarify, on the basis of experimental measurements, the behaviour of a topographic function after various ways of cutting; the knowledge of the function is necessary for solving both theoretical and practical technological tasks. The topographic function, which is a basis for the prediction of quality and control of the cutting processes, was derived in an original way.

40|$|At present, {{highly alloyed steels}} in the {{thickness}} range above 8 mm can be cut by laser radiation to only a limited extent: The high portion of alloying constituents is indeed reducing the thermal conductivity and thus the thermal losses during the cutting process. But on the other hand, especially with the most established laser cutting technique - laser <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> - the alloying elements are leading to detrimental effects even in the lower thickness range (1 - 4). Chromium oxides with a high melting point do not dissolve in the metallic melt. This condition causes a limitation of the exothermic reaction in {{the upper part of}} the cutting front. At the same time, the high viscosity of the oxide layer complicates the melt ejection. Thus, in the lower region of the cutting front, the oxide film is bursted by stagnating melt volume and subsequently an uncontrollable exothermic superreaction occurs. As is well known, this results in deep erosion, selective burning and high dross attachmen t. In order to solve these problems even in the sheet thickness range between 10 and 30 mm, 5 procedural variants of CO 2 laser beam cutting have been investigated and optimized...|$|R
40|$|In this work, an {{experimental}} {{study on the}} influence of the nozzle geometry on the physical properties of a cutting arc is reported. Ion current signals collected by an electrostatic probe sweeping across a 30 A <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> arc at 3. 5 mm from the nozzle exit were registered for different nozzle lengths. The temperature and density radial profiles of the arc plasma were found in each case by an inversion procedure of these signals. A comparison between the obtained results shows that the shorter nozzle (RN = 0. 50 mm, L N = 4. 5 mm operated at 0. 7 MPa and 35 Nl/min) produces a thinner and hotter arc than the larger nozzle (RN = 0. 50 mm, LN = 9. 0 mm operated at 1. 1 MPa and 20 Nl/min). This behavior is attributed to the marked difference of gas flow rate due to the clogging effect. A smaller gas mass flow reduces the convective cooling at the arc border and decreases the power dissipation of the arc column, resulting in small axis temperatures. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

500|$|In 2005, the Raptor Aeromedical Working Group, a USAF expert panel, {{recommended}} several {{changes to}} deal with the oxygen supply issues. In October 2011, Lockheed Martin was awarded a $24M contract to investigate the breathing difficulties. In July 2012, the Pentagon concluded that a pressure valve on flight vests worn during high-altitude flights and a carbon air filter were likely sources of at least some hypoxia-like symptoms. Long-distance flights were resumed, but were limited to lower altitudes until corrections had been made. The carbon filters were changed to a different model to reduce lung exposure to carbon particulates. The breathing regulator/anti-g (BRAG) valve, used to inflate the pilot's vest during high G maneuvers, was found to be defective, inflating the vest at unintended intervals and restricting the pilot's breathing. The on-board oxygen generating system (OBOGS) also unexpectedly reduced oxygen levels during high-G maneuvers.

40|$|Direct {{applications}} of High Power Diode Lasers (HPDLs) like hardening, heat conduction welding of metals and joining of polymers {{have already been}} demonstrated also in the industrial environment. Relatively low intensities {{in the range of}} 10 (exp 3) Wcm(exp - 2) are sufficient for these applications. While the commercial HPDL systems are built on the basis of diode laser bars with 40 W output power, in the meantime a record cw-output power of 267 W per bar has been demonstrated. The achievable higher output power per bar will lead to enhanced applicability of HPDLs and thus to a further steep increase of their industrial use. Improved packaging technology, multiplexing the emission of single bars and coherent coupling as well as promising new diode laser structures like Z-shaped broad area emitters are discussed. In this report emphasis is laid on the potential applicability of commercial HPDLs for metal working with elevated intensities up to 10 (exp 5) Wcm(exp - 2), like <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> and the worldwide first deep penetration HPDL-weld up to a sheet thickness of 6 mm in stainless steel.
