5|$|A celebration {{broke out}} among the miners, who broke into liquor {{warehouses}} and saloons.

5|$|Digging for Fire {{was based}} on a real {{incident}} in which Jake Johnson and his wife dug up a bone <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> in the garden of a house they had rented. Over a couple of weeks, he and a group of his friends dug up various objects before deciding to bury them again. Johnson described the experience to Joe Swanberg about three years later and they decided to make a film about it. They wrote a two-and-a-half–page outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue or detailed character descriptions. Swanberg wanted the actors to improvise the details of each scene and allowed them to make choices about their characters: for instance, Orlando Bloom decided that his character would ride a motorcycle, Chris Messina suggested that his character go swimming naked, and Brie Larson persuaded Johnson and Swanberg that her character would not be sexually attracted to Tim.|$|E
