Literature review was done on the theories and educational policy in Tanzania. Data collection was done through question and observation as well as documentary review from NECTA records. The findings indicate that majority teachers in secondary schools use three types of assessment which are diagnostic, formative and summative. Also the findings show that students understand why they are assessed. Not only that but also the impact of <b>assessment</b> <b>on</b> education is revealed...|$|R

40|$|Methods {{to assess}} {{detailed}} dietary data are cumbersome, expensive, {{and difficult to}} implement with large samples. The {{purpose of the present}} article was to evaluate the feasibility of collecting data from parents about their child's diet using an online dietary assessment tool. The Young Children's Nutrition <b>Assessment</b> <b>on</b> the Web was developed as part of a longitudinal study of familial influences on food intake of preschool children. A sample of 862 parents from 56 nursery schools completed a paper-and-pencil questionnaire containing sociodemographic variables and a food frequency questionnaire about their child's diet and psychosocial variables. Subsequently, a subset of parents was asked to either complete a paper-and-pencil food diary or the Young Children's Nutrition <b>Assessment</b> <b>on</b> the Web (n= 88); those remaining who provided e-mail addresses were asked to complete the Young Children's Nutrition <b>Assessment</b> <b>on</b> the Web (n= 467) and a user-acceptability questionnaire. This resulted in 39 useful paper-and-pencil diaries, 217 useful Young Children's Nutrition <b>Assessments</b> <b>on</b> the Web, and 164 user-acceptability questionnaires. Mann-Whitney U tests comparing nutrient (macronutrients, vitamin C, calcium, and fiber) and food group intakes from data collected with the Young Children's Nutrition <b>Assessment</b> <b>on</b> the Web vs paper-and-pencil diaries resulted in no substantial differences except for water. Attrition analyses indicated that dropout for the online assessment was associated with the sex of the respondent (father completing the questionnaire), lower social status, being a smoker, and lower nutrition knowledge. The online measure was well-received by respondents. The majority found it user-friendly (79 %), attractive (68 %), and clear (93 %). The Young Children's Nutrition <b>Assessment</b> <b>on</b> the Web is a promising tool to collect online dietary data. in large-scale surveys...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Given {{the weight}} in {{groundwater}} vulnerability assessment, entropy weight combined with DRASTIC model {{is considered to}} assess the groundwater vulnerability. The assessment index weight is assessed by entropy weight and the model is ultimately applied to the <b>assessment</b> <b>on</b> {{the vulnerability of the}} groundwater in Weining Plain of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Firstly, based <b>on</b> the seven <b>assessment</b> index attribute partition charts, the assessment index weight is calculated by entropy weight; then, by the ARCGIS grid image overlay tool to overlay the seven index grid images, the composite index chart of the <b>assessment</b> <b>on</b> the vulnerability of the groundwater in the study area is developed; finally, according to the classification standard, a partition chart of the <b>assessment</b> <b>on</b> the vulnerability of the groundwater in the study area is made to carry out the result analysis of the <b>assessment</b> <b>on</b> the vulnerability of the groundwater in the study area. The comprehensive assessment results indicate that the application of entropy weight to the DRASTIC model is feasible and the assessment results are more objective and direct...|$|R

Determining peak power output, cyclists completed a graded i) ramp <b>assessment</b> <b>on</b> a Kingcycle air-braked ergometer (PPOKING), ii) continuous <b>assessment</b> <b>on</b> a SRM electromagnetically-braked ergometer (PPOSRM), and iii) discontinuous <b>assessment</b> <b>on</b> a Monark friction-braked ergometer (PPOMON). Furthermore, a 40 -km road-based individual cycle race was completed. Throughout each, power was measured using an SRM Training System. Despite no differences (P > 0. 05) in O 2 peak across graded assessments, PPOKING (387  49 W) was 3. 6 % higher (P 0. 05 : PPOSRM; r = - 0. 42; P > 0. 05 : PPOMON; r = - 0. 41 : P > 0. 05). Independent of determination, peak power output was strongly related to performance power and may provide effective means of obtained training and racing intensities...|$|R
