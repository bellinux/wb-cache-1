2500|$|A {{preliminary}} study indicates taking donepezil (<b>Aricept)</b> {{may help prevent}} falls in people with Parkinson's. [...] Donepezil boosts the levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and is currently an approved therapy for the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

2500|$|Treatment of the {{movement}} and cognitive portions of the disease may worsen hallucinations and psychosis, while treatment of hallucinations and psychosis with antipsychotics may worsen parkinsonian or ADHD symptoms in DLB, such as tremor or rigidity and lack of concentration or impulse control. Physicians may find the use of cholinesterase inhibitors represents the treatment of choice for cognitive problems and donepezil (<b>Aricept),</b> rivastigmine (Exelon), and galantamine (Reminyl) may be recommended {{as a means to}} help with these problems and to slow or prevent the decline of cognitive function. [...] DLB may be more responsive to donepezil than Alzheimer's disease. Memantine also may be useful. Levocarb may help with movement problems, but in some cases, as with dopamine agonists, may tend to aggravate psychosis in people with DLB. Clonazepam may help with rapid eye movement behavior disorder; table salt or antihypotensive medications may help with fainting and other problems associated with orthostatic hypotension. Botulinum toxin injections in the parotid glands may help with sialorrhea. Other medications, especially stimulants such as the ADHD drug methylphenidate (Ritalin) and modafinil, may improve daytime alertness, but as with the antiparkinsonian drug Levocarb, antihyperkinetics such as Ritalin increase the risk of psychosis. Experts advise extreme caution in the use of antipsychotic medication in people with DLB because of their sensitivity to these agents. When these medications must be used, atypical antipsychotics are preferred to typical antipsychotics; a very low dose should be tried initially and increased slowly, and patients should be carefully monitored for adverse reactions to the medications.|$|E

5000|$|Binswanger's {{disease has}} no cure {{and has been}} shown to be the most severe {{impairment}} of all of the vascular dementias. The best way to manage the vascular risk factors that contribute to poor perfusion in the brain is to treat the cause, such as chronic hypertension or diabetes. It has been shown that current Alzheimer’s medication, donepezil (trade name <b>Aricept),</b> may help Binswanger’s Disease patients as well [...] Donepezil increases the acetylcholine in the brain through a choline esterase inhibitor which deactivates the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine. Alzheimer as well as Binswanger patients have low levels of acetylcholine and this helps to restore the normal levels of neurotransmitters in the brain. This drug may improve memory, awareness, and the ability to function. If no medical interception of the disease is performed then the disease will continue to worsen as the patient ages due to the continuing atrophy of the white matter from whatever was its original cause.|$|E
5000|$|For {{more than}} 35 years, Davies’ {{research}} {{has been focused on}} the biochemistry of Alzheimer's disease. His early work was instrumental {{in the development of the}} currently approved drugs for Alzheimer’s disease: <b>Aricept,</b> Exelon, and Razodyne. Davies is interested in the pathway of Alzheimer’s disease and has said that the disease may be a process of cell cycle division gone wild. He has evidence that the switch that drives the cell cycle of neurons, which is a one-time event when the neuron is born, is somehow tripped and reactivated late in life. He and his team designed an experiment to turn on the cell cycle in laboratory models. They put a viral oncogene into differentiated neurons and watched as pathological events unfolded. Davies and his collaborators have already identified a marker in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that can distinguish Alzheimer’s disease from normal aging, as well as discriminate between Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. [...] The overall goal of Davies’ research is to develop treatments to slow or halt the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Davies is internationally known for his work in unravelling the mystery of Alzheimer’s disease.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the trend in {{incidence}} and prevalence of dementia, use and spending of antidementia and antipsychotic drugs among dementia patients. Methods: Using 2006 - 2012 Medicare claims data, we identified individuals with diagnosis of dementia and collected their pharmacy claims in 2006 - 2012. We built regression models to test the trend in number of prescriptions and spending on antidementia, antipsychotic, and other drugs. Results: The prevalence of dementia did not change during our study period. Spending on antidementia and antipsychotic drugs creased to increase in 2011, following the patent expiration of <b>Aricept,</b> Zyprexa, and Seroquel; and total pharmaceutical spending did not change in 2006 - 2012. Use of antidementia drugs increased during our study period; however, the off-label use of antipsychotic drugs did not decrease.

40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} devastating and {{debilitating}} diseases affecting the aging population. Dementia is the most widely known deficit in AD patients, typically starts with loss of recent memory (minutes to hours), and progresses to loss of long-held memories and unable to recognize their loved ones. People with AD eventually lose their ability to take care of themselves. As a consequence the cost of care is huge, and it also takes a tremendous emotional toll on the family of AD patients. Two hallmarks of AD are senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which are composed of amyloid β (Αβ) and tau, respectively. Despite extensive search for effective treatment over the past decades, available drugs have limited efficacy without affecting the course of AD. For example, cholinesterase inhibitors (such as <b>Aricept)</b> enhance the function of cholinergic functions by elevating the concentration of acetylcholine and improve memory functions moderately [1]. Memantine, a NMDA subtype glutamate recepto...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Amyloid-β (Aβ) -induced {{impairment}} of hippocampal synaptic plasticity is an underlying mechanism of memory {{loss in the}} early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in human and mouse models. The inhibition of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) autophosphorylation plays an important role in long-term memory. In this study, we isolated naringin from Pomelo peel (a Citrus species) and studied its effect on long-term memory in the APPswe/PS 1 dE 9 transgenic mouse model of AD. Three-month-old APPswe/PS 1 dE 9 transgenic mice were randomly assigned to a vehicle group, two naringin (either 50 or 100 mg/kg body weight/day) groups, or an <b>Aricept</b> (2 mg/kg body weight/day) group. After 16 weeks of treatment, we observed that treatment with naringin (100 mg/kg body weight/day) enhanced the autophosphorylation of CaMKII, increased the phosphorylation of the α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic (AMPA) receptor at a CaMKII-dependent site and improved long-term learning and memory ability.

30|$|This study {{demonstrated}} that curvularin and α, β-dehydrocurvularin {{were the two}} main structurally related secondary metabolites produced by Chrysosporium lobatum strain BK- 3 with slightly different bioactive profiles. Both these compounds were active against different cancer cell lines. However, α, β-dehydrocurvularin did not exhibit inhibition for AChE, while curvularin did, which suggested that the partial planar backbone structure {{in the presence of}} a 3, 4 -double bond played an important role in the inhibition of AChE activity. Further, the docking analysis showed that similar to <b>Aricept</b> ligand, curvularin showed a strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the bottom and middle of the binding site of AChE enzyme. Curvularin had good docking scores as compared to the existing drug galanthamine; in case of CDOCKER curvularin had higher docking score than galanthamine (53.931 and 37.72, respectively). The docking study clearly revealed that the curvularin molecule had better interactions and it was fitting very well into the receptor of AChE enzyme. It was showing better interactions than galanthamine. To the best of our knowledge this is a first study on the characterization of metabolites of Chrysosporium lobatum strain BK- 3 isolated from Kaziranga National Park biosphere exhibiting AChE inhibitory, cytotoxicity and antioxidant activities.|$|E
