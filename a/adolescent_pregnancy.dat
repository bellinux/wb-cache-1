5|$|Pregnancy {{presents}} substantial health risks, even {{in developed}} countries, and despite advances in obstetrical science and practice. Maternal mortality remains {{a major problem}} in global health and is considered a sentinel event in judging the quality of health care systems. <b>Adolescent</b> <b>pregnancy</b> represents a particular problem, whether intended or unintended, and whether within marriage or a union or not. Pregnancy results in major changes in a girl's life, physically, emotionally, socially and economically and jeopardises her transition into adulthood. <b>Adolescent</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> more often than not, stems from a girl's lack of choices. or abuse.

40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} the maternal serum amino acid levels in first trimester <b>adolescent</b> <b>pregnancies</b> {{by using a}} new developed dietary questionnaire. Methods: A group of 169 pregnant women in the first trimester of their pregnancy {{were asked to complete}} the dietary questionnaire. Among all the women, 39 were <b>adolescent</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> The results of the questionnaire were evaluated by a nutrient database program (BeBiS software program) designed to evaluate Turkish traditional foods and commercial processed foods. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of body mass index and educational and socio-economic status. The mean age and gravidity was statistically significantly lower in <b>adolescent</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> The mean isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, threonine, valine, arginine, and proline levels were statistically significantly lower in <b>adolescent</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed the cut-off values of these amino acids. Of these amino acids; lower values of histidine, serine, and alanine were associated with lower birth weight, and lower values of histidine and alanine were associated with preterm delivery. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the amino acid levels in <b>adolescent</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> According to this study, some amino acid levels were lower in <b>adolescent</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Further studies with maternal and perinatal outcomes are needed to demonstrate the effects of these amino acids in such pregnancies...|$|R

40|$|Sujatha Seetharaman, Sophia Yen, Seth D Ammerman Division of Adolescent Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, Palo Alto, CA, USA Abstract: Globally, {{unintended}} <b>adolescent</b> <b>pregnancies</b> pose {{a significant}} burden. One {{of the most}} important tools that can help prevent unintended pregnancy is the timely use of emergency contraception (EC), which in turn will decrease the need for abortions and complications related to <b>adolescent</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> Indications for the use of EC include unprotected sexual intercourse, contraceptive failure, or sexual assault. Use of EC is recommended within 120 hours, though is most effective if used as soon as possible after unprotected sex. To use EC, adolescents need to be equipped with knowledge about the various EC methods, and how and where EC can be accessed. Great variability in the knowledge and use of EC around the world exists, which is a major barrier to its use. The aims of this paper were to 1) provide a brief overview of EC, 2)  discuss key social determinants affecting knowledge and use of EC, and 3) explore best practices for overcoming the barriers of lack of knowledge, use, and access of EC.

The adolescent mothers of low standard of living index has higher odd ratio as compare to the adolescent mothers of higher standard of living index. Teenage mothers do not use the family planning methods and prenatal care. They do not deliver the baby in the health care facility and breastfeed their baby immediately after the delivery. The odd ratio is higher for no breastfeeding after child birth. In order to reduce the teenage pregnancy, government of Uttar Pradesh must generate more self employment opportunities to women and girls. The vocational training will improve the employment possibilities among adolescent girls. Government must provide the health care facilities to the poorer households.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Adolescent</b> <b>pregnancies</b> are {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} that can have {{both positive and negative}} consequences. The rights framework allows us to explore <b>adolescent</b> <b>pregnancies</b> not just as isolated events, but in relation to girls' sexual and reproductive freedom and their entitlement to a system of health protection that includes both health services and the so called social determinants of health. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore policy makers' and service providers' discourses concerning <b>adolescent</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> and discuss the consequences that those discourses have for the exercise of girls' sexual and reproductive rights' in the province of Orellana, located in the amazon basin of Ecuador. Methods We held six focus-group discussions and eleven in-depth interviews with 41 Orellana's service providers and policy makers. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using discourse analysis, specifically looking for interpretative repertoires. Results Four interpretative repertoires emerged from the interviews. The first repertoire identified was "sex is not for fun" and reflected a moralistic construction of girls' sexual and reproductive health that emphasized abstinence, and sent contradictory messages regarding contraceptive use. The second repertoire -"gendered sexuality and parenthood"-constructed women as sexually uninterested and responsible mothers, while men were constructed as sexually driven and unreliable. The third repertoire was "professionalizing adolescent pregnancies" and lead to patronizing attitudes towards adolescents and disregard of the importance of non-medical expertise. The final repertoire -"idealization of traditional family"-constructed family as the proper space for the raising of adolescents while at the same time acknowledging that sexual abuse and violence within families was common. Conclusions Providers' and policy makers' repertoires determined the areas that the array of sexual and reproductive health services should include, leaving out the ones more prone to cause conflict and opposition, such as gender equality, abortion provision and welfare services for pregnant adolescents. Moralistic attitudes and sexism were present - even if divergences were also found-, limiting services' capability to promote girls' sexual and reproductive health and rights. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about how population-attributable risks (PAR) for adverse birth {{outcomes}} due to smoking differ in <b>adolescent</b> and adult <b>pregnancies.</b> METHODS: An analysis of community and hospital-based cross-sectional studies in Liverpool was undertaken to estimate the PAR values of low birthweight (LBW), preterm birth, and small for gestational age (SGA) births resulting from pregnancy smoking covering the period between 1983 and 2003. Maternal smoking status and pregnancy outcomes were available for a sample of 12631 women. RESULTS: The prevalence of maternal pregnancy smoking was 40 % in the community sample and 33 % in adults and 40 % among <b>adolescent</b> <b>pregnancies</b> in the hospital sample. The PAR values (95 % CI) associated with LBW, preterm birth and SGA outcomes due to maternal pregnancy smoking in the community sample were 27 % (25 - 30), 13 % (11 - 15) and 25 % (23 - 27), respectively. The PAR values in adults in the hospital sample were 29 % (27 - 31) for LBW, 16 % (14 - 19) for preterm birth and 28 % (26 - 31) for SGA. The corresponding PAR values in adolescents were 39 % (34 - 43), 12 % (7 - 18) and 31 % (23 - 40). The LBW risk attributed to <b>pregnancy</b> smoking in <b>adolescents</b> {{was significantly higher than}} for adults (P= 0. 05). CONCLUSION: About one-third of LBW, one-quarter of SGA and one-sixth of preterm births could be attributed to maternal smoking during pregnancy.

It is a public health concern in South Africa as it may affect the health; social and economic well-being of society at large. Although immediate determinants of teenage pregnancy in South Africa relate to behaviour, the fundamental drivers are more deeply rooted institutional problems of poverty, underdevelopment and gender based violence. In addition, government policies, socio-economic injustices, unequal power structures and culture contribute to the high rates of teenage pregnancies in South Africa. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess contributing to <b>adolescent</b> <b>pregnancies</b> with in three rural communities in Eastern Cape Province.
