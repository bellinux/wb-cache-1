40|$|Drug {{consumption}} in China {{is still a}} very sensitive issue. In the 19 th century, the drug traffic imposed by outside forces caused two opium wars between the Qing dynasty and some Western countries and led to strong control of China by those powers. Opium <b>addiction</b> reached <b>epidemic</b> proportions, much more prevalent than today, and the Imperial Court, and afterwards the Republic of China, could not act effectively on what was a disastrous situation. Opium consumption {{was one of the main}} causes of the country's poverty, weakness, and backwardness. Before the constitution of the People's Republic of China in 1949, there were about 20 million drug addicts (Wang Z., 1995 a, 1995 b). The new government introduced new laws to stop the production, traffic, sale, and consumption of drugs and, within 3 years, almost completely stamped out these practices. However, drug abuse has been rising steadily since the late 1970 s, owing to the economic reform and the open-door policy of the Chinese government, social and cultural changes, and the large amount of opium an...|$|R

40|$|The United States {{experiences}} opioid <b>addiction</b> at <b>epidemic</b> levels. In 2012, the National Institute of Drug Abuse {{reported that}} 23. 1 million Americans were {{in need of}} addiction treatment services, although only 2. 5 million were enrolled in treatment. Following {{an amendment to the}} Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (Public Law 106 - 310), advanced practice nurses were qualified as providers who could bridge the healthcare gap in treatment access. The purpose of this project was to determine the interest of advanced practice nurses in (a) prescribing buprenorphine and (b) establishing guidelines {{that would allow them to}} do so. This quantitative project used a 10 -question Internet-based survey with a convenience sample of 95 nurses (recruited online) who were currently practicing in advanced nursing roles. Social media platforms, including Facebook, were used to recruit participants. The survey included questions about expanding the scope of practice in addiction treatment and establishing guidelines that would allow nursing knowledge and expertise to be used in outpatient opiate addiction treatment. Critical social theory and Kingdon 2 ̆ 7 s theory of policy analysis were applied to support the project. The Survey Monkey data analysis tool was used to generate descriptive statistics, which demonstrated respondents 2 ̆ 7 support for an expanded scope of practice. If the recommendations of this project are adopted by national legislation, increased accessibility to addiction treatment services will save millions of dollars in justice system, healthcare system, employment, and societal costs.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{characteristics}} of alcohol abuse and addiction {{is the loss of}} control over alcohol intake and the continuation of drinking in the face of negative consequences. Mounting evidence strongly suggests that an alcohol-induced imbalance between goal-directed and habitual behavior may be one {{of the main}} driving factors of this key feature of addiction and furthermore play a key role in staying abstinent. Current therapies often focus only on deficient inhibitory control (i. e., goal-directed behavior), but largely neglect the potential of the well-functioning habit formation found in patients. Yet, focusing on intact habitual/automatic mechanisms in addition to or maybe even instead of deficient cognitive control might equip us with a more effective tool to battle the current alcohol abuse and <b>addiction</b> <b>epidemic,</b> especially with respect to more severely impacted patients who likely suffer from permanent alcohol-induced brain damage. Against this background, I would like to advocate the application and scientific evaluation of habit reversal therapy (HRT) for alcohol abuse and addiction...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2015. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Tremendous growth in opioid prescribing {{over two decades}} in the USA has correlated with proportional increases in diversion, addiction, and overdose deaths. Pseudoaddiction, a concept coined in 1989, has frequently been cited to indicate that under-treatment of pain, rather than addiction, is the more pressing and authentic clinical problem in opioid-seeking pa-tients. This investigative review searched Medline articles containing the term Bpseudoaddiction ^ to determine its foot-print in the literature {{with a focus on}} how it has been charac-terized and empirically validated. By 2014, pseudoaddiction was discussed in 224 articles. Only 18 of these articles con-tributed to or questioned pseudoaddiction from an anecdotal or theoretical standpoint, and none empirically tested or con-firmed its existence. Twelve of these articles, including all four that acknowledged pharmaceutical funding, were proponents of pseudoaddiction. These papers described pseudoaddiction as an iatrogenic disease resulting fromwithholding opioids for pain that can be diagnosed, prevented, and treated with more aggressive opioid treatment. In contrast, six articles, none with pharmaceutical support, questioned pseudoaddiction as a clin-ical construct. Empirical evidence supporting pseudoaddiction as a diagnosis distinct from addiction has not emerged. Nevertheless, the term has been accepted and proliferated in the literature as a justification for opioid therapy for non-terminal pain in patients who may appear to be addicted but should not, from the perspective of pseudoaddiction, be diag-nosed with addiction. Future studies should examine whether acceptance of pseudoaddiction has complicated accurate pain assessment and treatment, and whether it has contributed to or reflected medical-cultural shifts that produced the iatrogenic opioid <b>addiction</b> <b>epidemic...</b>|$|E
40|$|Alcohol use {{disorder}} (AUD) {{represent a}} major health problem worldwide. Despite the severe consequences of AUD, only four medications are approved in Sweden for this disease. In addition, the prescription rates are low, {{partly due to}} varying clinical efficacy of these medications. Consequently, new, more effective pharmacotherapies are needed. A main problem {{in the treatment of}} AUD is the long-lasting vulnerability to relapse. Relapse is typically triggered by: stress, acute exposure to the drug, or drug-associated cues or context. Impaired impulsive control, often seen in AUD individuals, might further contributes to relapse to alcohol drinking. The dopamine (DA) system is one possible treatment target for AUD. Dopamine D 2 receptors has been suggested to be involved in mediating alcohol’s reinforcing properties and a decrease in DA release and a reduction in D 2 receptors have been found in detoxified AUD patients. This DA down-regulation is hypothesized to induce alcohol craving and contribute to relapse even after a long period of abstinence. In addition to the role of DA in AUD, DA has also been suggested to be involved in impulse behavior. The monoamine stabilizer (-) -OSU 6162 (OSU 6162) has the ability to stimulate, inhibit, or show no effect on DA-related behaviors depending upon the prevailing dopaminergic tone. In this thesis, we evaluated the potential of OSU 6162 as a new treatment for AUD using validated preclinical models of behaviors related to AUD. We have, in this thesis, identified OSU 6162 as a potential novel treatment for AUD. Using a battery of animal models, we showed that OSU 6162 attenuated voluntary alcohol intake, alcohol withdrawal symptoms (tail stiffness and walking with broad gait), the motivation to seek alcohol, cue/priming-induced reinstatement (relapse) of alcohol seeking, and relapse-like drinking in in rats that had been drinking alcohol {{for a long period of}} time. Moreover, we showed that OSU 6162 pre-treatment improved motor impulsivity in both alcohol and alcohol-naïve rats. Furthermore, OSU 6162 did not induce conditioned place preference in either alcohol-naïve rats or rats that had been drinking alcohol before the experiment, indicating that OSU 6162 does not possess any abuse liability on its own. Together these results highlights OSU 6162 ’s potential to prevent relapse triggered by alcohol craving, alcohol related cues, re-exposure to alcohol and or an urge to relieve abstinence symptoms. In addition, the improved impulse control following OSU 6162 treatment might help AUD individuals to override a compulsive drug-taking behavior in response to craving and thereby possibly prevent relapse to alcohol drinking. In addition to the global health problems related to alcohol, an opioid <b>addiction</b> <b>epidemic</b> is ongoing in the United State. We therefore decided to examine the potential of OSU 6162 to attenuate self-administration of the opioid oxycodone in rats. The results showed that OSU 6162 attenuated operant oxycodone self-administration but had no effect on context-induced reinstatement, at least in the dose tested. These preliminary results indicate that OSU 612 might have potential to decrease intake of oxycodone, however, further studies are needed to fully evaluate the potential of OSU 6162 on oxycodone self-administration and reinstatement. In conclusion, the results in this thesis indicate that OSU 6162 may serve as a novel treatment for AUD and provided the necessary rational for a clinical “proof-of-concept” study with OSU 6162 in alcohol dependent patients. The clinical study was successfully executed and supported our preclinical findings by showing that OSU 6162 attenuated alcohol craving in alcohol dependent patients. Thus, the rapid and fruitful transition of OSU 6162 from bench to clinic highlights the importance of the preclinical medication development program used in this thesis work...|$|E
