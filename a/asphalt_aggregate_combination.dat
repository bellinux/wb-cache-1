40|$|Abstract: The surface {{free energy}} is an {{important}} parameter {{that can be used}} to estimate the adhesion work of <b>asphalt</b> binder and <b>aggregates</b> system. Based on the theory of surface physical chemistry, the {{surface free energy}} of the base asphalt and asphalt modified by natural asphalt is determined by measuring contact angles with the sessile drop method. The adhesion grade of <b>asphalt</b> and <b>aggregate</b> is obtained by the boiled water method. The method of calculating adhesion work is studied first. Then, the adhesion work of <b>asphalt</b> <b>aggregate</b> systems and <b>asphalt</b> <b>aggregate</b> water systems are determined, respectively. Test results show that by increasing the additive of natural asphalt, the adhesion work of natural asphalt modifier <b>asphalt</b> and <b>aggregate</b> elevates distinctly, and the adhesion work of the modified <b>asphalt,</b> <b>aggregate</b> and water system decreases. There is a good relation between the adhesion grade and the adhesion work of dry and the adhesion work in the presence of water.

40|$|Moisture {{damage or}} {{stripping}} is an asphalt pavement distress that is generally {{recognized as the}} loss of the bond between the asphalt binder and the aggregate. Several pavement distresses that can include stripping as the underlying cause are rutting, cracking, raveling, flushing, and bleeding. Stripping can progress from either the top or bottom of hot mix pavement layer. The common cause in all cases of stripping is the presence of water. The potential for a hot mix asphalt pavement to incur moisture damage can be controlled or reduced through material selection, mixture designs that include a high asphalt film thickness, additives, proper pavement design, construction, compaction, and drainage. Many agencies include moisture sensitivity testing in the asphalt mixture design stage. The outcome of this testing can be used to eliminate certain <b>asphalt</b> and <b>aggregate</b> <b>combinations</b> or to require the use of an antistrip additive. The most commonly used antistrip additives are hydrated lime and liquid chemical additives. The moisture sensitivity test procedure recommended in the SHRP SuperPave mixture design protocol is AASHTO T- 283, “Resistance of Compacted Bituminous Mixture to Moisture Induced Damage”. The purpose of this research is to determine if hydrated lime and high performance chemical additives perform similarly using AASHTO T- 283 as the prediction model for the moisture sensitivity of a hot mix asphalt mixture. In this research, the optional freeze cycle was incorporated in the test method in order to increase the potential for moisture damage to occur to the specimens. This was done to distinguish high performing, no additive mixtures and also at the recommendation of McGennis and Aschenbrener that high traffic and severity one pavement mix designs should include it (1). An additional purpose of this research was to determine the effective dosage concentrations for the liquid chemical additives...|$|R

The factors influencing the adhesion fatigue performance were also investigated. Experiment results show that asphalt has more important effect on the adhesion performance comparing with aggregate. Basalt, which is regarded as hydrophobic aggregates with low silica content, has better adhesion performance to asphalt binder when compared with granite. The effects of aging on the adhesion fatigue performance are different for PG 64 - 22 and rubber asphalt. Long-term aging is found to reduce the adhesion fatigue lives for rubber <b>asphalt</b> and <b>aggregate</b> system, while the effect of long-term aging for aggregate and PG 64 - 22 binder system is positive.

In this paper, the {{electrical}} analysis of emulsified <b>asphalt</b> and <b>aggregate</b> explains the reaction {{mechanism of the}} emulsified <b>asphalt</b> and <b>aggregate.</b> When emulsified <b>asphalt</b> and wet mineral aggregate contact each other, asphalt particles with a charge have chemical adsorption with aggregate at the surface of mineral <b>aggregate,</b> and <b>asphalt</b> particles are arranged {{on the surface of}} later quickly. Subsequently, asphalt of recycled mixture can be more cohesive after a series of process between emulsion and aggregate, such as demulsification and drying by distillation. A compact structure is formed by <b>asphalt</b> wrapping <b>aggregate</b> to make recycled mixture high strength.
