5|$|Argentina is {{vulnerable}} {{and will likely}} be significantly impacted by climate change. Temperatures have increased {{in the last century}} while the observed changes in precipitation are variable, with some areas receiving more <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> less. These changes have impacted river flow, increased the frequency of extreme weather events, and led to the retreat of glaciers. Based on the projections for both precipitation and temperatures, these climatic events are likely to increase in severity and create new problems associated with climate change in the country.|$|E
5|$|Beaumont almost {{instantly}} became a boomtown with investors {{from around the}} state and the nation participating in land speculation.

The Lucas gusher itself was short-lived; production fell to 10,000 barrels per day by 1904. The strike, however, was only the beginning of a much larger trend.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the jet stream {{was at least}} {{partly responsible for the}} widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States. Normally, the jet stream flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> of the Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.|$|E
