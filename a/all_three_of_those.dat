During 1942 and 1943, Keres and Alekhine both played in four tournaments organized by Ehrhardt Post, a President of Nazi Grossdeutscher Schachbund. Alekhine won at the Salzburg 1942 chess tournament (Six Grandmasters' Tournament) in June 1942, at Munich (European Individual Chess Championship) in September 1942, and at Prague (International Tournament) in April 1943, always ahead of Keres, who placed second in <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> tournaments.

25|$|After his {{departure}} from Penske, Kvapil signed with PPI Motorsports for the 2006 NASCAR Sprint Cup season. He drove the No. 32 Tide-sponsored Chevrolet for the 2006 season. He had his best finishes {{of the season}} at Kansas Speedway, Pocono Raceway, and Talladega Superspeedway, where he finished 19th in <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> events. Kvapil finished the season 36th in points, {{and was forced to}} find a new ride for the next season as his PPI contract only lasted one year. PPI eventually shut down after the 2006 due to the inability to find a sponsor to replace Tide. The team also did not have a manufacturer commitment for the 2007 NASCAR Sprint Cup season.|$|E
25|$|Clemens's 2005 {{season ended}} {{as one of}} the finest he had ever posted. His 1.87 ERA was the lowest in the major leagues, the lowest of his 22-season career, and the lowest by any National Leaguer since Greg Maddux in 1995. He {{finished}} with a 13–8 record, with his lower win total primarily {{due to the fact that}} he ranked near the bottom of the major leagues in run support. The Astros scored an average of only 3.5 runs per game in games in which he was the pitcher of record. The Astros were shut out nine times in Clemens' 32 starts, and failed to score in a 10th until after Clemens was out of the game. The Astros lost five of Clemens' starts by scores of 1–0. In April, Clemens did not allow a run in three consecutive starts. However, the Astros lost <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> starts by a 1–0 score in extra innings.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} of being the reigning champion of all the current four Majors did not exist until 1924–25, when the International Lawn Tennis Federation designated the Australasian, French (before 1925 only open to members of French tennis clubs), British and American championship tournaments as the four Majors. Before that time only three events: Wimbledon, the World Hard Court Championships (held in Paris & once in Brussels) and the World Covered Court Championships (held in various locations) were considered the premier international tennis events by the ILTF. Tony Wilding of New Zealand won <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> earlier majors in one year: 1913. It has been possible to complete a Grand Slam in most years and most disciplines since 1925. It was not possible from 1940 to 1945 because of interruptions at Wimbledon, the Australian and French opens due to the Second World War, the years from 1970 to 1985 {{when there was no}} Australian tournament in mixed doubles, and 1986 when there was no Australian Open at all.|$|E

25|$|Shepard {{became the}} first American in space by making a {{suborbital}} flight in May 1961. He went on to fly in the Apollo program and became the only Mercury astronaut {{to walk on the}} Moon. Gus Grissom, who became the second American in space, also participated in the Gemini and Apollo programs, but died in January 1967 during a pre-launch test for Apollo 1. Glenn {{became the first}} American to orbit the Earth in February 1962, then quit NASA and went into politics, serving as a US Senator from 1974 to 1999, and returned to space in 1998 as a Payload Specialist aboard STS-95. Deke Slayton was grounded in 1962, but remained with NASA and was appointed Chief Astronaut at the beginning of Project Gemini. He remained in the position of senior astronaut, in charge of space crew flight assignments among many other responsibilities, until towards the end of Project Apollo, when he resigned and began training to fly on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975, which he successfully did. Gordon Cooper became the last to fly in Mercury and made its longest flight, and also flew a Gemini mission. Carpenter's Mercury flight was his only trip into space. Schirra flew the third orbital Mercury mission, and then flew a Gemini mission. Three years later, he commanded the first manned Apollo mission, becoming the only person to fly in <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> programs.|$|E

But I wouldn't bet on it. [...] " [...] Toomey also later added another review of the premiere, stating that [...] "I'm worried though. Dexter is good. In fact, it's really good.

2500|$|A {{form of the}} epsilon–delta {{definition}} of continuity was first given by Bernard Bolzano in 1817. Augustin-Louis Cauchy defined continuity of [...] as follows: an infinitely small increment [...] of the independent variable x always produces an infinitely small change [...] of the dependent variable y (see e.g., Cours d'Analyse, p.34). Cauchy defined infinitely small quantities in terms of variable quantities, and his {{definition of}} continuity closely parallels the infinitesimal definition used today (see microcontinuity). The formal definition and the distinction between pointwise continuity and uniform continuity were first given by Bolzano in the 1830s but the work wasn't published until the 1930s. Like Bolzano, Karl Weierstrass denied continuity of a function at a point c unless it was defined at and {{on both sides of}} c, but Édouard Goursat allowed the function to be defined only at and on one side of c, and Camille Jordan allowed it even if the function was defined only at c. <b>All</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> nonequivalent definitions of pointwise continuity are still in use.
