25|$|As {{a wealthy}} and {{powerful}} nation with limited winemaking resources, England had a marked {{influence on the}} development of sparkling Champagne. Non-sparkling Champagne became popular in London society following the arrival of epicurean Charles de Saint-Évremond in 1661. At parties and banquets, Saint-Évremond feverishly promoted the wines of the Champagne region. Soon some of the most powerful and fashionable men of London, such as the Duke of Bedford and the Duke of Buckingham as well as the Earl of Arlington were making regular orders of cases of Champagne. The wine was non-sparkling, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> intended to be. Wine was often transported to England in wooden wine barrels and merchant houses would then bottle the wine for sale. During the 17th century, English glassmakers used coal-fueled ovens and produced stronger, more durable glass bottles than wood-fired French glass. The English also rediscovered the use of cork stoppers, once used by the Romans but forgotten for centuries {{after the fall of the}} Western Roman Empire. During the cold winters of the Champagne region, temperatures would drop so low that the fermentation process was prematurely halted, leaving some residual sugar and dormant yeast. When the wine was shipped to and bottled in England, the fermentation process would restart when the weather warmed and the cork-stoppered wine would begin to build pressure from carbon dioxide gas. When the wine was opened, it would be bubbly.|$|E
500|$|... "Silly Love Songs" [...] was {{met with}} {{critical}} acclaim from many television critics upon its initial airing. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave a very positive review of the episode, and wrote, [...] "This was our favorite type of Glee episode. Though we enjoy over-the-top spectacles , the show's real cleverness shines when they take songs from across the board and fit them into a cohesive storyline. Sue Sylvester didn't make an appearance and—dare we say it—we didn't even miss her." [...] Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed the episode, going on to write, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} strong showing, if a little disjointed. Well, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> honest. If this show is one thing, it's disjointed. It's part of its spazzy appeal." [...] Melissa Maerz of the Los Angeles Times gave the episode a positive review: [...] "On Tuesday night, Glee wasn’t only back at its usual time, it was back to doing what it does best: giving us entertaining [...] storylines involving characters we care about who sing songs that emerge organically and advance the story. It was like a perfect heart-shaped bubble of an episode reminding the show’s fans about all the things we’ve missed about the show these last couple of months." ...|$|E

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 11, 1910. The film was originally planned to be released on November 4, but it was delayed and some advertisements and later listings for the film give the erroneous date. The film received negative reviews in trade publications from even those which typically praised even the weaker productions. Though it was not well-received, the production was not criticized as sharply as Avenged had been. Walton of The Moving Picture News stated that the film was [...] " [...] very feeble echo on Anthony Hope. The throne room staging is ridiculous {{and so is the}} resolution. The flag-waving business is feebly melodramatic. Princes, etc. don't sit on that sort of chair. I'm an admirer of Thanhouser, but this thing is straight, plain punk. In Europe it will be received as a Yankee joke." [...] The reviewer for The Moving Picture World was decidedly neutral, highlighting only the novelty of the plot and refraining from any criticism or praise of the merits of the production. The New York Dramatic Mirror was negative, but not scathing. The reviewer stated, [...] "The narrative is very entertaining - or could be made so, if the producer had cared to trouble himself about details. In its present crude form, its wild impossibility rather grates upon a spectator, because every scene in the film has some inconsistency. <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> worth doing well. Unfortunately, neither the acting nor the mounting has any particular merit." ...|$|E
500|$|Rob Salem of Toronto Star {{said that}} [...] "fans {{who have been}} {{complaining}} about this season’s relative complacency [...] finally got their gore and more when the farm was overrun by suddenly, strangely single-minded walkers." [...] Pamela Mitchell of Houston Chronicle commented that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] was the most eventful episode of the season, while Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery thought that [...] "every single major character gets their moment to shine"; [...] "Epic, action-packed, emotional—'Beside the Dying Fire' is great television," [...] she concluded. TV Guide television critic Michael Logan affirmed that the season finale [...] "was so scary and shock-a-minute outrageous that it nearly made our heads explode." [...] In his A– review, Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club said that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] adequately accomplished what he was hoping for. He wrote, [...] "We're finally off Hershel's farm, in about the most definitive way imaginable: The barn has been burned, and the house itself is overrun by a herd of 'walkers'." [...] New York Starlee Kine adulated the installment, and asserted that it was comparable to episodes of The Walking Dead first season. [...] "It’s just amazing how much smoother the plot holes go down when something is actually happening on this show. For {{the first time since}} last season, I felt engrossed enough to not be consumed with all the small things this show gets wrong. Up until this episode, the majority of this season has consisted exclusively of small things: petty dramas, misdirected stakes, so much stalling. I’m not sure I can {{go so far as to}} say that it got everything right with this one, but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> entertaining and the nonstop action felt like content instead of just bookends." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote that it was the closest the program [...] "ever resembled the climax of a George Romero film." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings felt that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] sufficiently encompassed a climax for its storylines, adding that it left the audience anticipating for future installments of the series.|$|E

As I don't believe you to be inspired, I suspect you to have suspected this. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a mighty happy suspicion.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Northwestern carried {{tourists}} on excursions up the Columbia Gorge to the Bonneville Dam, a 120-mile round trip from Portland. [...] In 1936, Northwestern was chartered by businessman Ralph J. Staehil, {{to run on}} excursions up the Columbia River to view the newly built. Bonneville Dam [...] These excursions carried capacity loads of passengers, which was fortunate, or so it <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> claimed, for Northwestern, which, having been built for shallow water, required a considerable load before its sternwheel would even touch the water.|$|E
2500|$|On farmers' markets, {{a bottle}} of beer costs about 53 North Korean won. Foreign beers such as Heineken, Tiger, Erdinger, and Bavarian and are {{increasingly}} available. A can of Chinese beer, such as Tsingtao or Harbin, can cost up to 4,000 won at the Jangmadang (grey market). Poor rural people brew their own beer with whatever ingredients they can find; [...] "We found corn flower and hops and made something that came out a weird milky color. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> fizzy like beer", one North Korean defector remembers.|$|E
2500|$|The tilt hammer or tail helve hammer has a pivot at {{the centre}} of the helve on which it is mounted, and is lifted by pushing the {{opposite}} end to the head downwards. In practice, the head on such hammers seems to have been limited to one hundredweight (about 50kg), but a very rapid stroke rate was possible. This made it suitable for drawing iron down to small sizes suitable for the cutlery trades. [...] There were therefore many such forges known as 'tilts' around Sheffield. They were also used in brass battery works for making brass (or copper) pots and pans. In battery works (<b>at</b> <b>least)</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible for one power source to operate several hammers. In Germany, tilt hammers of up to 300kg were used in hammer mills to forge iron. Surviving, working hammers, powered by water wheels, may be seen, for example, at the Frohnauer Hammer in the Ore Mountains.|$|E
