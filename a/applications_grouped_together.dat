40|$|Abstract. This work {{sets up a}} cobordism {{theory for}} {{manifolds}} with corners and gives an identification with the homotopy of a certain limit of Thom spectra. It thereby creates a geometrical interpretation of Adams-Novikov resolutions and lays the foundation for investigating the chromatic status of the elements so realized. As an <b>application</b> Lie <b>groups</b> <b>together</b> with their left invariant framings are calculated by regarding them as corners of manifolds with interesting Chern numbers. The work also shows how elliptic cohomology can provide useful invariants for manifolds of codimension 2. 1...|$|R

However, it is currently not possible to automatically obtain general semantic information from a video. Instead we rely on the structure of writing to approximate regions of the board that contains a single thought or idea. These regions provide an abstraction of the board {{that can be used in}} several applications, such as a note taker, a lec-ture indexing program, an automatic video editor, and a program for creating multimedia presentations. 1...|$|R

The {{combination}} of four 25 kWunits shown here ise {{representative of a}} village power application 1. 0 System Description Dish/engine systems convert the thermal energy in solar radiation to mechanical energy and then to electrical energy {{in much the same}} way that conventional power plants convert thermal energy from combustion of a fossil fuel t electricity. As indicated in Figure 1, dish/engine systems use a mirror array to reflect and concentrate incoming direct normal insolation to a receiver, in order to achieve the temperatures required to efficiently convert heat to work. This requires that the dish track the sun in two axes. The concentrated solar radiation is absorbed by the receiver and transferred to an engine. Dish/engine systems are characterized by high efficiency, modularity, autonomous operation, and an inherent hybrid capability (the ability to operate on either solar energy or a fossil fuel, or both). Of all solar technologies, dish/engine systems have demonstrated the highest solar-to-electric conversion efficiency (29. 4 %) [1], and therefore have the potential to become one of the least expensive sources of renewable energy. The modularity of dish/engine systems allows them to be deployed individually for remote <b>applications,</b> or <b>grouped</b> <b>together</b> for small-grid (village power) or end-of-line utility applications. Dish/engine systems can also be hybridized with a fossil fuel to provide dispatchable power. This technology is in the engineering development stage and technical challenges remain concerning the solar components and the commercial availability of a solarizable engine. The following describes the components of dish/engine systems, history, and current activities...|$|R

40|$|Visibility {{computation}} {{is crucial}} for computer graphics from its very beginning. The first visibility algorithms aimed to determine visible lines or surfaces in a synthesized image of a 3 D scene. Nowadays there is a plethora of visibility algorithms for various applications. The thesis proposes a taxonomy of visibility problems based on the dimension of the problem-relevant line set, i. e. set of lines forming {{the domain of the}} visibility problem. The taxonomy helps to identify relationships between visibility problems from various <b>application</b> areas by <b>grouping</b> <b>together</b> problems of similar complexity. The thesis presents a general concept of a visibility algorithm suitable for solution of several classes of visibility problems. The concept is based on three main ideas: an approximate occlusion sweep, an occlusion tree, and hierarchical visibility tests. The central idea of the concept is the occlusion tree representing an aggregated occlusion map by means of a hierarchical subdivision in line space. The thesis presents several applications of the concept. The major focus is placed on visibility culling algorithms for real-time rendering acceleration. First, we describe an algorithm for real-time visibility culling. The algorithm is used to accelerate rendering of large densely occluded scenes. It improves previous results by efficiently performing occluder fusion in real-time. We propose several techniques exploiting temporal and spatia...|$|R
