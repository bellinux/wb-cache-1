40|$|The {{effect of}} storage for 6 months at 5 degreesC (80 % RH) versus 20 degreesC (60 % RH) of shelled versus in-shell <b>almonds</b> was studied on early versus late {{harvested}} nuts from 'Ferragnes' and 'Texas' trees.

Early harvested <b>almonds</b> had similar kernel weight to but higher moisture content than late harvested <b>almonds</b> after 6 months of storage. Early harvested <b>almonds</b> also had similar oil quality (based on ultraviolet absorption coefficient measurements) and oil composition but lower sugar content and modified sugar composition compared with late harvested <b>almonds.</b> Storage of shelled <b>almonds</b> resulted in kernels with higher oil content, better oil quality, similar oil composition, similar sugar content and some modifications in sugar composition compared with in-shell stored <b>almonds.</b> Finally, storage for 6 months at either 5 or 20 degreesC resulted in lower moisture content, higher oil content, similar oil quality and composition, similar sugar content and some modifications in sugar composition compared with freshly harvested <b>almonds.</b> <b>Almonds</b> stored at 5 degreesC retained higher kernel weight and moisture content than <b>almonds</b> stored at 20 degreesC.

40|$|Pentadesma {{butter is}} still {{traditionally}} extracted starting from pretreated <b>almonds</b> by traditional techniques of heating. The {{aim of this}} work was to study {{the effect of the}} <b>almonds</b> post-harvest pretreatments on the physicochemical characteristics, the extraction yield {{and the quality of the}} Pentadesma butter. In addition, the effect of the various unit operations of the extraction technology on the quality of the extracted butter from pretreated <b>almonds</b> was studied. According to the same traditional process of extraction, two various butters of Pentadesma were extracted starting from <b>almonds</b> differing only by the post-harvest pretreatment applied (roasting or boiling). The color, the aspect and the breaking strength of the <b>almonds</b> were different. The butter extraction yield varied according to the pretreatment applied. The best yields (33. 5 _ 4. 1 %) were obtained from boiled <b>almonds,</b> but their transformation was more difficult than that of roasted. The analysis of the samples at different stages of the transformation allowed the appreciation of the effect of the <b>almonds</b> pretreatments on the acidity and the peroxide value variations at each unit operation of the butter extraction. The fatty acid composition and the tocopherol content of the two extracted butters varied with the <b>almonds</b> pretreatments. The roasted <b>almonds</b> provided a richer butter in stearic acid, a and d-tocopherols and less rich in oleic acid than that provided by the boiled <b>almonds.</b> The pretreatments allowed a total loss of the contained linolenic acid, b and dtocopherols in the butters and decreased the oleic acid and a- tocopherol contents. The physico-chemical characteristics of the Pentadesma butter varied according to the <b>almonds</b> pretreatments. Thus, it would be interesting to make a reasoned choice of the most suitable post-harvest pretreatment in order to obtain a butter with a good quality and an acceptable extraction yield.

5|$|Hygrophorus bakerensis, {{commonly}} known as the Mt. Baker waxy cap, the brown <b>almond</b> waxy cap or the tawny <b>almond</b> waxy cap, is a species of fungus in the Hygrophoraceae family. It is characterized by its medium to large, relatively slender-statured fruit bodies with an <b>almond</b> odor, and growth often on or near rotting conifer wood. The slimy cap is brown in the center and cream to white near its curved edges. The gills and the stem are white, and in moist environments are often covered with droplets of a translucent liquid. The mushroom is known only from the United States, where it is common in coniferous forests throughout the Pacific Northwest. It was initially collected in Washington State on Mount Baker, a volcano. Although edible, the mushroom is not considered to be of high quality.|$|E

40|$|Two {{outbreaks}} of salmonellosis {{were linked to}} the consumption of raw California <b>almonds</b> in 2001 and 2004. Current federal regulations mandate that all <b>almonds</b> grown in California are {{to be treated with}} a process that results in a 4 -log reduction of Salmonella. Since four out of the five approved technologies to pasteurize <b>almonds</b> rely on the application of heat to control Salmonella, the evaluation of alternative technologies against heat resistant Salmonella Senftenberg was imminent. In this study, <b>almonds</b> that were inoculated with S. Enteritidis PT 30 and S. Senftenberg, were treated with electron beam irradiation (e-beam), blanching and oil roasting. The thermal death time (D-value) for S. Enteritidis PT 30 when treated with e-beam was 0. 90 kGy, 15 s when subjected to blanching at 88 degrees C, and 13 s when treated with oil at 127 degrees C. Irradiation and thermal resistance of S. Senftenberg was not significantly different (P > 0. 05) from S. Enteritidis PT 30. The commercial application of e-beam as a pathogen intervention was assessed through Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) and experimental measurements. The sensory characteristics of <b>almonds</b> commercially treated by e-beam, blanching and roasting were assessed by a consumer panel. Irradiated and blanched <b>almonds</b> did not differ in consumer overall like (P > 0. 05). Bitterness and rancidity attributes of irradiated <b>almonds</b> were between a "dislike slightly" and "dislike moderately", whereas blanched and roasted <b>almonds</b> were between "neither like nor dislike" and "like slightly". <b>Almonds</b> commercially irradiated, blanched and roasted were subjected to an accelerated shelf-life test (ASLT) evaluating percentage free fatty acids, peroxide value, and 2 -thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs). No clear differences between treatments were observed at any given point in time in any of the chemical tests. A gas chromatography-mass-spectrometry-olfactometry (MDGC-MS-O) technology was used to compare full aroma and flavor profiles from raw and e-beam irradiated <b>almonds.</b> Differences in the aroma/odor profile and the taste analysis revealed that the difference between raw and irradiated <b>almonds</b> is extremely subtle. In conclusion, e-beam may be a feasible technology to control Salmonella in <b>almonds</b> if used at low doses, {{as a part of a}} series of interventions...|$|R

5|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{is particularly important}} for crops such as <b>almond</b> growing in California, where honey bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value in 2011 was $3.6 billion.

Because of such high demand in pollinators, the cost of renting honey bees has increased significantly, and California's <b>almond</b> industry rents approximately 1.6 million honey bee colonies during the spring to pollinate their crop.
