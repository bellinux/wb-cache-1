5|$|After {{producing}} The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, Madhouse {{was asked}} to produce something new. Hosoda and writer Satoko Okudera conceived {{a story about a}} social network and a stranger's connection with a family. The real-life city of Ueda was chosen as the setting for Summer Wars, as part of the territory was once governed by the Sanada clan and was close to Hosoda's birthplace in Toyama. Hosoda used the clan <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Jinnouchi family after visiting his then-fiancé's home in Ueda.|$|E

5|$|During the mid-to-late 1960s Notosusanto wrote {{extensively}} on the military history of Indonesia, including a book on Supriyadi's anti-Japanese rebellion in 1945 and the Battle of Surabaya. His 1968 book on the 30 September Movement coup in 1965, written in collaboration with Ismail Saleh and entitled The Coup Attempt of the 30 September Movement in Indonesia, was the first on the subject to be published. It was later used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pro-Suharto film Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI (Treachery of G30S/PKI; 1984), for which Notosusanto received a writing credit.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 Janáček {{retired from}} his post as {{director}} of the Brno Conservatory, but continued to teach until 1925. In 1921 he attended a lecture by the Indian philosopher-poet Rabindranath Tagore, and used a Tagore poem <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> chorus The Wandering Madman (1922). At the same time he encountered the microtonal works of Alois Hába. In the early 1920s Janáček completed his opera The Cunning Little Vixen, which had been inspired by a serialized novella in the newspaper Lidové noviny.|$|E

One such coin {{in the collection of the}} San Francisco Mint was described by them as genuine from 1887 to 1927. Electrotypes were also created by Mint employees, and one was used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pantograph reproductions which appeared in Eckfeldt and DuBois' 1842 A Manual of Gold and Silver Coins of All Nations.|$|E
5|$|More than 50 {{years after}} the events {{described}} in the book, Perlmutter Rozines began telling her story to family members, starting with her son, Roy's cousin Greg, who told Roy's sister Julia, who told Roy.

5|$|Seeing {{a growing}} {{business}} in online communications utilities, Delrina licensed Hilgraeve's HyperACCESS terminal emulator system in 1993, {{and used it}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> initial version of its WinComm online communications software. The initial version of the product was originally bundled with WinFax {{as part of the}} Delrina Communications Suite, but in March 1994 was issued as a standalone product. It was a relative latecomer to the market, which was then dominated at the time by Datastorm's Procomm series of communications software.|$|E

In League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry (2006), the Court ruled that House Majority Leader Tom DeLay's Texas redistricting plan intentionally diluted the votes of Latinos and thus violated the Equal Protection Clause.|$|E
5|$|The future {{eastern half}} of Highway 82 came first, as a rough path over Independence Pass that soon reached Aspen. A private company {{improved}} it into a toll road for stagecoaches, open year-round. The city's rapid growth fostered a race {{to make the first}} rail connection, which displaced the toll road as the primary route to Aspen within a decade. Later, the railroad's right-of-way would serve <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> highway.|$|E

5|$|To {{film the}} scenes at the Wall the {{production}} built a {{set on the}} abandoned quarry of Magheramorne, a few minutes north of Belfast. The composite set (with both exteriors and interiors) consisted of a large section of Castle Black including the courtyard, the ravenry, the mess hall and the barracks, and used the stone wall of the quarry <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ice wall that protects Westeros from the dangers that dwell beyond.

5|$|Adventure {{received}} mostly positive reviews at {{the time}} of its release and has continued to be viewed positively in the decades since, often named as one of the industry's influential titles. It is considered the first action-adventure and console fantasy game, and inspired other titles in the genres. More than one million cartridges of Adventure were sold, and the game has been included in numerous Atari 2600 game collections for modern computer hardware. The game's prototype code was used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1979 Superman game, and a planned sequel eventually formed the basis for the Swordquest games. The Easter egg concept pioneered by the game has transcended video games and entered popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{life has}} also been used {{in a wide variety}} of other media. The {{director}} David Bintley used Marlowe's play <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ballet Edward II, first performed in 1995; the music from the ballet forms a part of composer John McCabe's symphony Edward II, produced in 2000. Novels such as John Penford's 1984 The Gascon and Chris Hunt's 1992 Gaveston have focused on the sexual aspects of Edward and Gaveston's relationship, while Stephanie Merritt's 2002 Gaveston transports the story into the 20th century. Marcus Stone's painting Edward II and Piers Gaveston strongly hinted at a homosexual relationship between the pair, while avoiding making this aspect explicit; it was initially shown at the Royal Academy in 1872, but was marginalised in later decades as the issue of homosexuality became more sensitive.|$|E

5|$|In 1887 Michelson {{proposed}} {{the use of}} optical interferometers for the measurement of length, work which contributed to him being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1907. In 1952 the CIPM {{proposed the}} use of wavelength of a specific light source as the standard for defining length, and in 1960 the CGPM accepted this proposal using radiation corresponding to a transition between specified energy levels of the krypton 86 atom as the new standard for the metre. By 1975, when the second had been {{defined in terms of}} a physical phenomenon rather than the earth's rotation and Einstein's assertion that the speed of light was constant, the CGPM authorised the CIPM to investigate the use of the speed of light <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> definition of the metre. This proposal was accepted in 1983.|$|E
5|$|In May 1948, AMC asked Boeing to {{incorporate}} the previously discarded, but now more fuel-efficient, jet engine into the design. That resulted {{in the development of}} yet another revision—in July 1948, Model 464-40 substituted Westinghouse J40 turbojets for the turboprops. The Air Force project officer who reviewed the Model 464-40 was favorably impressed, especially since he had already been thinking along similar lines. Nevertheless, the government was concerned about the high fuel consumption rate of the jet engines of the day, and directed that Boeing still use the turboprop-powered Model 464-35 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> XB-52. Although he agreed that turbojet propulsion was the future, General Howard A. Craig, Deputy Chief of Staff for Material, was not very keen on a jet-powered B-52, since he felt that the jet engine had not yet progressed sufficiently to permit skipping an intermediate turboprop stage. However, Boeing was encouraged to continue turbojet studies even without any expected commitment to jet propulsion.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 1943, Hergé {{decided that}} he wanted Edgar P. Jacobs, a fellow cartoonist, to {{collaborate}} with him on The Adventures of Tintin. Although initially hesitant, Jacobs eventually agreed, adopting the paid position in January 1944. The two became close friends and artistic collaborators, with Jacobs aiding him in developing {{various aspects of the}} plot, for instance developing the idea of the crystal balls and the story's title. Although stylistically they were different both in forms of illustration and narrative, they influenced each other greatly. He used Jacobs as a life model from whom he drew various poses that characters adopt in the story. He also used Jacobs as a researcher, sending him to the Cinquantenaire Museum to study its collections of Incan material, and it was the mummified Incan corpse in their collection that was used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mummy of Rascar Capac.|$|E
