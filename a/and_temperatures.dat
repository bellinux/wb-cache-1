5|$|Water maser {{emission}} {{is observed}} primarily at 22GHz, {{due to a}} transition between rotational energy levels in the water molecule.

The water molecule comes into thermal equilibrium at molecular hydrogen number densities of roughly 1011 cm−3, so this places an upper limit on the number density in a water masing region.

40|$|In this work, interpenetrating {{polymeric}} networks (IPNs) {{composed of}} pH sensitive poly(methacrylic acid) <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> sensitive poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) were synthesized.

The swelling behavior was investigated under various pH <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> conditions. The observed pH <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> transitions in swelling studies of the IPNs are approximately the same as each individual network. A possible hydrogen-bonding structure is proposed between the carboxylic acid groups in poly(methacrylic acid) and the amide groups in poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide). ATRFTIR studies show small shifts in the wavenumbers of the characteristic peaks of the IPNs versus the non-IPN polymers, an indication of intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions within the system. Diffusion behavior of the IPN hydrogels was investigated using solute permeation and controlled release studies. The IPNs exhibit a significant size exclusion behavior on solutes with various sizes. The pH <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> effects on the solute permeation and release are discussed. An ideal property of the IPN can be tailored by manipulating the pH <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> inputs. Additionally, the IPN morphology was studied using SEM and AFM.
