5|$|O'Sullivan {{returned}} to {{action at the}} Masters, to a mixed response from the audience (being both booed <b>and</b> <b>clapped).</b> He won his first round match 6–1 on 16 January 2007, against Ali Carter, making two century breaks in the process. However, he then created more controversy by failing to attend a post-match press conference. He did record a short interview with Steve Davis for the BBC, stating that he was much happier than at the UK Championship, {{and that he was}} playing well once again. Sir Rodney Walker later issued a statement declaring that O'Sullivan had been excused from dealing with the media because of the exceptional circumstances affecting him. This decision was criticised by Shaun Murphy. O'Sullivan {{went on to win the}} tournament against Ding Junhui, on 21 January 2007. In the match, he was noted for his good sportsmanship by Steve Davis, specifically for comforting Ding after the twelfth frame, during which Ding had become visibly upset by an overly partisan member of the crowd, who was later ejected. O'Sullivan was leading 9–3 at the time, and won the next frame for a 10–3 victory.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{on the eve}} of the 40th {{anniversary of}} his first fight with Ali, and the year of his death, Frazier reiterated that he had forgiven Ali. Frazier's funeral service was {{attended}} by Ali who reportedly stood <b>and</b> <b>clapped</b> vigorously when the Rev. Jesse Jackson asked the mourners to stand and bring their hands together one last time for Frazier.|$|E
25|$|After another {{injury to}} Almunia in early April 2008, Lehmann {{was back in}} goal for the away game against Manchester United on 13 April 2008. Arsenal lost that game 2–1, {{virtually}} ending their Premier League title hopes for the season, their third consecutive season without a major trophy. There was speculation that {{would be his last}} game for Arsenal, but on 19 April Lehmann played in the home game against Reading, which Arsenal won 2–0. The following week, Łukasz Fabiański was given his Premier League debut against Derby County and Almunia returned to the bench for the game. However, Lehmann made another appearance and was brought on for Fabiański in the last 20 minutes of the game against Everton on 4 May 2008, Arsenal's final home game of the season. He was given a standing ovation after the match as he bowed <b>and</b> <b>clapped</b> to the fans. Later that day, Wenger confirmed that it was Lehmann's farewell appearance.|$|E

500|$|Gameplay {{mechanics}} were {{singled out}} as being particularly poor. The third-person shooter sections suffered from poor camera-angle management, making targeting enemies feel [...] "awkward and disjointed". Enemy artificial intelligence for these sections was described as predictable and basic, adopting repeated firing stances or ignoring the character despite being shot repeatedly. Sniper variants of this fared better. The vehicle sections were also disappointing, with physics and vehicle handling being rated poorly. Vehicles were described as feeling [...] "slow <b>and</b> <b>clapped</b> out", with pursuits described as being [...] "boring". The use of AI in these sections were heavily criticized for being predictable and simplistic, with enemy vehicles having no regard for their own safety. The puzzle games were also received badly, being described as [...] "15 shades of easy and 20 shades of terrible". Interrogation scenes were, in contrast, well liked, with reviewers finding the dialogue during these scenes entertaining.|$|E
500|$|In June 1958 Monteux {{conducted}} the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) in three concerts, {{described by the}} orchestra's historian Richard Morrison as [...] "a sensation with players, press and public alike." [...] The first concert included Elgar's Enigma Variations, in which Cardus judged Monteux to be more faithful to Elgar's conception than English conductors generally were. Cardus added, [...] "After {{the performance of the}} 'Enigma' Variations, the large audience cheered <b>and</b> <b>clapped</b> Monteux for several minutes. This applause, moreover, broke out just before the interval. English audiences are not as a rule inclined to waste time applauding at or during an interval: they usually have other things to do." [...] Monteux considered British concertgoers [...] "the most attentive in the world", and British music critics [...] "the most intelligent". However, a disadvantage of conducting a London orchestra was having to perform at the Festival Hall, of which he shared with Beecham and other conductors an intense dislike: [...] "from the conductor's rostrum it is impossible to hear the violins".|$|E
2500|$|Frazier told Sports Illustrated in May 2009 that he {{no longer}} held hard {{feelings}} for Ali. After Frazier's death in November 2011, Ali was among those who attended the private funeral services for Frazier in Philadelphia. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who spoke during the service, asked those in attendance to stand and [...] "show your love" [...] and reportedly Ali stood with the audience <b>and</b> <b>clapped</b> [...] "vigorously".|$|E

2500|$|In Campo: Still Entertaining Campese {{writes that}} Cardiff Arms Park is [...] "Certainly the venue I have fondest {{memories}} of after {{a standing ovation}} the crowd there gave me in 1988. It was during a Barbarians match, and my attacking game was about as finely-tuned as it had ever been. I had {{made a couple of}} really good runs and, after setting up one try and scoring another, the crowd got to their feet <b>and</b> <b>clapped</b> me back to halfway. I'll never forget it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Hawkes {{burned to}} death in 1555 during the Marian Persecutions rather than allow his son to be baptised into the Roman Catholic Church. Responding to Edmund Bonner, the Bishop of London, who urged {{him to return to}} Catholicism, he is {{reported}} to have said: [...] "No my lord, that I will not, for if I had a hundred bodies I would suffer them all to be torn in pieces rather than I will abjure and recant." [...] As he burned, Hawkes threw up his hands <b>and</b> <b>clapped</b> them three times, a sign to his friends that the pain could be endured. Hawkes' death and the circumstances leading up to it are recorded in detail in John Foxe's Book of Martyrs.|$|E
2500|$|When {{apparently}} the last eminent guest {{had long ago}} taken his place, again those three bugle-blasts rang out, and once more the swords leaped from their scabbards. Who might this late comer be? Nobody was interested to inquire. Still, indolent eyes were turned toward the distant entrance, and we saw the silken gleam and the lifted sword of a guard of honor plowing through the remote crowds. Then we saw that end of the house rising to its feet; saw it rise abreast the advancing guard all along like a wave. This supreme honor had been offered to no one before. There was an excited whisper at our table—'MOMMSEN!'—and the whole house rose. Rose and shouted and stamped <b>and</b> <b>clapped</b> and banged the beer mugs. Just simply a storm! ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 1924 {{election}} campaign, Reeves {{was asked}} to {{speak on behalf of}} both the Liberal and Labour Party candidates. [...] She choose to support Labour: [...] "The Liberal audiences were nice narrow decent people. They sat upright in rows <b>and</b> <b>clapped</b> their cotton gloves... But when I got to the Labour meetings in the slums, among the costers and the railway men and the women in tenth hand velvet hats – when I saw their pinched grey-and-yellow faces in those steamy halls, I knew all of a sudden that they were my people". [...] She soon {{became a member of the}} party and supported her husband as the Labour Party candidate for Holland-with-Boston in Lincolnshire. [...] The seat had gone to the Liberals in a by election earlier that year and Rivers failed to win it back. Amber attempted to get her theories on currency, later brought together in her book The Nationalisation of Banking, adopted by the Labour Party, and she and Rivers became responsible for a party publication called Womens Leader. Amber remained active in the Fabian Society, and by this time many Fabians agreed that there was a need to work through the parliamentary Labour Party. She stood twice as a candidate for Hendon, in 1931 and 1935 ...|$|E
