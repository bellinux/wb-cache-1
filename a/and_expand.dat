5|$|As governor, Ford raised {{revenue from}} a {{severance}} tax on coal, a two-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, {{and an increased}} corporate tax. He balanced these increases by exempting food from the state sales tax. The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects. His victory in the primary had been largely due to Jefferson County, and he returned the favor by approving funds to build the Commonwealth Convention Center <b>and</b> <b>expand</b> the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center.

Adan, supported by Magen, would go on to reach Suez after the failure of a United Nations ceasefire, thereby cutting off two infantry divisions of the Egyptian Third Field Army. Sharon also crossed with part of his division, simultaneously trying to defend <b>and</b> <b>expand</b> the Israeli corridor to the Suez Canalâ€”as well attacking northwards on the west bank to Ismailia in an attempt to similarly cut off the Second Army.

5|$|Because he was {{credited}} with divine power himself, the pharaoh, as a sacred king, was regarded as Egypt's representative to the gods and its most important upholder of maat. Thus, it was theoretically his duty to perform the temple rites. While it is uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies, the existence of temples across Egypt {{made it impossible for}} him to do so in all cases, {{and most of the time}} these duties were delegated to priests. The pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain, provide for, <b>and</b> <b>expand</b> the temples throughout his realm.|$|E
5|$|Because the 1924 Rose Bowl {{and several}} later Rose Bowls had very high ticket sales, the Tournament of Roses Association decided to close off the {{southern}} end of the Rose Bowl stadium <b>and</b> <b>expand</b> the seating from a horseshoe design to one that surrounded the entire field. The 1924 game was the first in which the Tournament of Roses made participating schools responsible for ticket sales. The strategy has been used since, with only a small number of tickets allocated to Tournament officials for each yearly edition.|$|E
5|$|Cavities are {{in great}} demand for nesting by other cavity nesters, so {{woodpeckers}} face {{competition for the}} nesting sites they excavate {{from the moment the}} hole becomes usable. This may come from other species of woodpecker, or other cavity nesting birds like swallows and starlings. Woodpeckers may aggressively harass potential competitors, and also use other strategies to reduce the chance of being usurped from their nesting site; for example the red-crowned woodpecker digs its nest in the underside of a small branch, which reduces the chance that a larger species will take it over <b>and</b> <b>expand</b> it.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{experience}} in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894â€“1895 convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the Jeune Ecole naval philosophy, which emphasized torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships, and Japan embarked on a program to modernize <b>and</b> <b>expand</b> its fleet in preparation for further confrontations.
