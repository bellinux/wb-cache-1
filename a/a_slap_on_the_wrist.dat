500|$|After his {{retirement}} from an mechanical failure, Br√§ck stated it affected his championship chances slightly and {{his retirement}} {{from the race}} was [...] "something that you don't want to have happen but unfortunately it happens sometimes and today {{it was one of}} those days." [...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points deducted and was placed on probation for the next three road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a probation period of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: We did not want to simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this will not be tolerated. Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. We want our response to send out the very strong message that this isn't <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> or a token punishment.|$|E
