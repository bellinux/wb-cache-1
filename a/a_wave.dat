5|$|Although {{the newly}} formed BJP was {{technically}} distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file were identical to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president. Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early 1980s were marked by <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> of violence between Hindus and Muslims. The BJP initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of Gandhian Socialism. This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984. The assassination of Indira Gandhi {{a few months earlier}} resulted in <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> of support for the Congress which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP.|$|E

40|$|Hypotension with {{ventricular}} pacing {{has generally}} been attributed to loss of atrial transport, {{but it has been}} suggested that atrialvasodepressor reflexes may play a role. To study this, constant rate atrial and ventricular pacing was performed in 20 supine patients 24 to 36 hours after surgical coronary artery bypass or aortic valve replacement. The pulmonary capillary wedge tracing was examined for the presence or absence of cannon <b>A</b> <b>waves</b> during ventricular pacing in each patient. Thirteen patients had cannon <b>A</b> <b>waves</b> (group I) and seven did not (group II). Ten of the 13 patients with cannon <b>A</b> <b>waves</b> had ventriculoatrial conduction compared with only 2 of 7 patients without cannon <b>A</b> <b>waves.</b> There was <b>a</b> nonsignificant trend toward an association between cannon <b>A</b> <b>waves</b> and ventriculoatrial conduction (p = 0. 1). Stroke volume index decreased in both groups when patients were changed from atrial to ventricular pacing. In the patients with cannon <b>A</b> <b>waves,</b> stroke volume index decreased from 31. 2 to 26. 3 cc/min per m 2 (p < 0. 001) and from 31. 2 to 25. 0 cc/min per m 2 (p < 0. 001) in those without cannon <b>A</b> <b>waves</b> (group I versus groupII, p = NS). However, mean systemic blood pressure decreased only in patients with cannon <b>A</b> <b>waves</b> (99. 4 to 85. 9 mm Hg [p < 0. 001] versus 101. 8 to 100. 9 mm Hg [p = NS]) in those without cannon <b>A</b> <b>waves</b> (group I versus group II, p < 0. 001). Hypotension in patients with cannon <b>A</b> <b>waves</b> was caused by inhibition of the normal reflex increase in systemic vascular resistance. In these patients, systemic vascular resistance increased only 5 %, whereas in those without cannon <b>A</b> <b>waves</b> it increased 23 % (group I versus group II, p < 0. 002). It is concluded that hypotension with ventricular pacing is primarily due to a vasodepressor reflex initiated by left atrial cannon <b>A</b> <b>waves.</b> Although ventricular pacing generally causes a decrease in stroke volume due to loss of normal atrial transport, the induction of hypotension requires the presence of left atrial cannon <b>A</b> <b>waves</b> that inhibit normal vascular reflexes. These hemodynamic consequences of ventricular pacing in susceptible patients may be prevented by maintaining atrial synchrony with atrial or dual chamber pacing...|$|R

5|$|Faraday's and Ampère's work {{showed that}} a {{time-varying}} magnetic field acted {{as a source of}} an electric field, and a time-varying electric field was a source of a magnetic field. Thus, when either field is changing in time, then a field of the other is necessarily induced. Such a phenomenon has the properties of <b>a</b> <b>wave,</b> and is naturally referred to as an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves were analysed theoretically by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864. Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric field, magnetic field, electric charge, and electric current. He could moreover prove that such <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> would necessarily travel at the speed of light, and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation. Maxwell's Laws, which unify light, fields, and charge are one of the great milestones of theoretical physics.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, Louis de Broglie {{proposed}} that all moving particles—particularly subatomic particles such as electrons—exhibit {{a degree of}} wave-like behavior. Erwin Schrödinger, fascinated by this idea, explored {{whether or not the}} movement of an electron in an atom could be better explained as <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> rather than as a particle. Schrödinger's equation, published in 1926, describes an electron as a wavefunction instead of as a point particle. This approach elegantly predicted many of the spectral phenomena that Bohr's model failed to explain. Although this concept was mathematically convenient, it was difficult to visualize, and faced opposition. One of its critics, Max Born, proposed instead that Schrödinger's wavefunction described not the electron but rather all its possible states, and thus could be used to calculate the probability of finding an electron at any given location around the nucleus. This reconciled the two opposing theories of particle versus wave electrons and the idea of wave–particle duality was introduced. This theory stated that the electron may exhibit the properties of both <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> and a particle. For example, it can be refracted like <b>a</b> <b>wave,</b> and has mass like a particle.|$|E
