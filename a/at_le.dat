5|$|Meanwhile, the Norman nobility {{gathered}} <b>at</b> <b>Le</b> Neubourg {{to discuss}} declaring Theobald king, probably following {{the news that}} Stephen was gathering support in England.

5|$|On 15 April 1941, Galland {{took off}} with lobster and {{champagne}} to celebrate General Theo Osterkamp's birthday <b>at</b> <b>Le</b> Touquet, France. He made a detour with his wingman towards England, looking for RAF aircraft. Off the cliffs of Dover, he spotted a group of Spitfires. Galland attacked and claimed two confirmed and one unconfirmed shot down. The actual result was the destruction of one Spitfire; {{the other two were}} damaged in force landings with both pilots wounded. During the combat, Galland's undercarriage had dropped causing one of the RAF pilots (Flight Lieutenant Paddy Finucane) to claim Galland's aircraft as destroyed, but Galland landed without incident <b>at</b> <b>Le</b> Touquet and presented Osterkamp with his gifts. Galland's success that day represented his 60th and 61st aerial victory.|$|E
5|$|President James Monroe and Congress invited Lafayette {{to visit}} the United States in 1824, in part to {{celebrate}} the nation's upcoming 50thanniversary.

LouisXVIII did not approve of the trip, and his officers had troops disperse the crowd that gathered <b>at</b> <b>Le</b> Havre to see Lafayette off.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, {{a number of}} those convicted for collaborating with the Nazi {{occupiers}} were freed from prison. Sympathetic to their plight, Hergé lent money to some and aided others in getting jobs at Tintin magazine, much to Leblanc's annoyance. For instance, as well as lending him money, Hergé used his connections to secure Raymond de Becker a job in Switzerland as a book shop sales inspector. He also hired those associated with collaboration for his Studios; his new colourist, Josette Baujot, was the wife of a recently assassinated member of the Walloon Legion, and his new secretary, Baudouin van der Branden de Reeth, had served a prison sentence for working <b>at</b> <b>Le</b> Nouveau Journal during the occupation.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{involvement}} at Pozières and Mouquet Farm, the 12th Battalion {{was briefly}} {{transferred to the}} Ypres sector in Belgium in September, before returning to Bernafay Wood on the Somme late the following month.

He was moved to the 2nd General Hospital <b>at</b> <b>Le</b> Havre, and returned to the 12th Battalion two weeks later following recuperation. On the same day, he was attached to the headquarters of the 2nd Australian Brigade for duty as a staff officer. He was granted leave on 21 January 1917 on completion of this stint.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the news}} that Stephen was {{gathering}} support in England, the Norman nobility had gathered <b>at</b> <b>Le</b> Neubourg to discuss declaring his elder brother Theobald king.

Their discussions were interrupted by the sudden news from England that Stephen's coronation was to occur the next day. Theobald's support immediately ebbed away, as the barons were not prepared to support the division of England and Normandy by opposing Stephen.|$|E
