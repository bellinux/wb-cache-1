50|$|Tamponade is {{the closure}} or {{blockage}} (as of a wound or body cavity) by {{or as if}} by a tampon, especially to stop bleeding. Tamponade is a useful method of stopping a hemorrhage. This {{can be achieved by}} applying an <b>absorbent</b> <b>dressing</b> directly into a wound, thereby absorbing excess blood and creating a blockage, or by applying direct pressure with a hand or a tourniquet.|$|E
5000|$|Tulle gras (French, [...] "oily tulle") or tulle gras {{dressing}} {{is a type}} of bandage {{commonly used}} in France, although the term is also used in English. It consists of fabric impregnated with soft paraffin oil (98 parts), balsam of Peru (1 part), and olive oil (1 part), which prevents its sticking to wounds, but means that it needs to be used in combination with another <b>absorbent</b> <b>dressing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Though {{early use}} focused on burns and {{surgical}} wounds, wider use of wounds treated with TCOT {{have become more}} common in diabetic foot ulcers, venous stasis and decubitus ulcers(pressure sores). TCOT involves inserting a thin tube which delivers the oxygen above the wound bed of a cleaned wound. An <b>absorbent</b> <b>dressing</b> is then placed above the tube and an occlusive or semi occlusive dressing is placed over the entire wound site. The {{far end of the}} tube is connected to an oxygen delivery unit, often portable, which delivers oxygen at a slow rate, typically 3ml per hour.|$|E
40|$|Background: Tracheostomy site {{infection}} {{can cause}} numerous problems. <b>Absorbent</b> foam <b>dressing</b> {{may be able}} to prevent proliferation of infectious microorganisms by absorbing the tracheostomy stoma exudate. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of absorbent foam with gauze dressing for prevention of tracheostomy site infection. Materials and Methods: In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, 80 patients (18 to 60 years) hospitalized {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) due to severe head injury were randomly divided into two groups and early tracheostomy was done for them during the first 2 days. In the first group, gauze was used as tracheostomy site dressing, while in the second, absorbent foam, was placed. Tracheostomy site was checked daily for any sign of infection and samples were taken from the stoma for culture in case of presence of any sign of infection. Results: Of a total of 80, 11 had tracheostomy site infection (13. 75 %), including 7 (17. 5 %) in the gauze group and 4 (10 %) in the foam group. The difference i...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the prevalence of silver resistance genes in 172 bacterial strains which had been isolated from both human and equine wounds. PCR screening for 8 currently named genes in 3 silver resistance transcriptional units, E, RS and P, CBA and F was performed on total DNA extracted from all clinical isolates. Plasmids were isolated from positive strains to determine if the genes were present on the chromosome. MICs and zone of inhibition assays were utilised to examine phenotypic resistance to silver nitrate and ionic silver. Evidence of silver resistance genes was demonstrated in six strains of, an organism rarely implicated as a primary pathogen in chronic wounds. MIC data showed that all strains were inhibited at silver nitrate concentrations ≥ 5 mg/L. When tested against a silver-containing <b>absorbent</b> wound <b>dressing</b> all strains showed inhibition of growth after 24 h. In MIC and zone of inhibition studies, inhibition was evident but reduced in strains which contained genes. Although genes were found in six of the wound isolates studied, the genes were consistently associated with a non-pathogenic bacterium. Furthermore, investigation of phenotypic resistance in -positive isolates showed that silver continued to be effective...|$|R
40|$|Prevention of peritoneal {{dialysis}} (PD) catheter infection begins with good surgical practice for catheter implantation and includes appropriate preoperative patient preparation and surgical technique {{as well as}} postimplantation care (1, 2). Because antibiotic penetration into the coagulum is poor, antibiotics should be present in sufficient concentration in the blood and tissue fluids before the coagulum is formed. This can be achieved if systemic antibiotics are given preoperatively. In an accompanying manuscript we showed that early colonization of exits is predominantly by Grampositive bacteria; however, some exits were colonized by Gram-negative bacteria, and these cases developed early infection (3). Therefore, systemic coverage for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms seems desirable for prophylaxis. Topical antibiotics may not be effective during the early postimplantation period, {{because they can be}} washed away by drainage from the exit. The evening preceding surgery the patient should shower using a long-Iasting disinfectant. The surgical preparation of the integument should be similar to that used for any major surgery. Perfect hemo stasis during surgery is of utmost importance in order to avoid hematoma formation along the catheter tunnel, because hematoma predisposes to early infection. The surgical incision and exit site should be covered with several layers of <b>absorbent</b> gauze <b>dressing.</b> It is important to immobilize the catheter as well as secure the dressings. Semipermeable dressings applied directly to the wound and occlusive dressing...|$|R

40|$|Surgical site {{infection}} (SSI) {{remains an}} important complication of cardiac surgery. Prevention is important, as SSI {{is associated with}} high mortality and morbidity rates. Incisional care is an important daily issue for surgeons. However, there is still scant scientific evidence on which guidelines can be based. A randomized clinical trial was performed to compare two options for postoperative incisional care. Patients undergoing sternotomy for cardiothoracic surgery were eligible. To protect an incision from exogenous contamination or direct inoculation by endogenous pathogens, the study group received an adhesive drape, impermeable to water and air. The control group was treated with a water- and air-permeable <b>absorbent</b> <b>dressing.</b> Primary outcome measure was SSI. Between March 2003 and January 2005, 1, 185 patients were included. Both groups were comparable for base-line characteristics. No {{significant difference was found}} in the incidence of sternal SSI between groups (2. 6 vs. 3. 3 %). In our study, an incisional-care program using a sterile, impermeable adhesive drape did not perform better than an <b>absorbent</b> <b>dressing</b> in reducing SSI after cardiothoracic surgery. In our view, future studies in the field of prevention of SSI should concentrate on other areas of interes...|$|E
40|$|A {{clinical}} study of 96 patients compared a new hydrocolloid dressing (Granuflex Extra Thin) with a non-adherent dressing (perforated film <b>absorbent</b> <b>dressing)</b> {{in the management}} of lacerations, abrasions and minor operation incisions at the Accident and Emergency (A&E) Department of the University College Hospital, Galway. While time to heal was similar for both groups, the patients using Granuflex Extra Thin experienced less pain (P < 0. 001), required less analgesia (P = 0. 0154) and were able to carry out their normal daily activities including bathing or showering without affecting the dressing or the wound. Patient satisfaction with the new dressing appeared to be very high especially in those patients who pursued an active lifestyle...|$|E
40|$|To {{accelerate}} {{healing of}} severe hemorrhagic wounds, a novel highly <b>absorbent</b> hemostatic <b>dressing</b> {{composed of a}} Tencel®/absorbent-cotton/polylactic acid nonwoven base and chitosan/nanosilver antibacterial agent was fabricated by using a nonwoven processing technique and a freeze-drying technique. This study {{is the first to}} investigate the wicking and water-absorbing properties of a nonwoven base by measuring the vertical wicking height and water absorption ratio. Moreover, blood agglutination and hemostatic second tests were conducted to evaluate the hemostatic performance of the resultant wound dressing. The blending ratio of fibers, areal weight, punching density, and fiber orientation, all significantly influenced the vertical moisture wicking property. However, only the first two parameters markedly affected the water absorption ratio. After the nonwoven base absorbed blood, scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation showed that erythrocytes were trapped between the fibrin/clot network and nonwoven fibers when coagulation pathways were activated. Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) blood agglutination of the resultant dressing decreased to 14. 34 and 50. 94 s, respectively. In the femoral artery of the rate bleeding model, hemostatic time was saved by 87. 2 % compared with that of cotton cloth. Therefore, the resultant antibacterial wound dressing demonstrated greater water and blood absorption, as well as hemostatic performance, than the commercially available cotton cloth, especially for healing severe hemorrhagic wounds...|$|R
40|$|Healthcare {{professionals}} (e. g., nurses, physiotherapists, paramedics etc.) use {{evidence to}} justify and underpin the activity or performance of practitioners. That is, evidence is deployed to defend practice and/or it sanctions change {{aimed at improving}} practice. Colloquially, the term “evidence based practice” (EBP) summaries and describes these activities or objectives. And the idea that professionals can practice {{in the absence of}} evidence is, today, difficult to sustain. EBP involves, among much else, the location and appraisal of literature. Thus, searches locate literature, and review or appraisal processes determine whether what has been found is robust enough to fulfil the role allotted to evidence. EBP works well for technical and ‘treatment option’ questions (e. g., “is this <b>dressing</b> more <b>absorbent</b> than that <b>dressing</b> in these circumstances?”). However, healthcare professionals legitimately and persistently interest themselves in, for example, normative and/or ethical questions. These can be addressed but not be answered using traditional scientific and/or biomedical knowledge (i. e., research report findings) and, faced with such questions, EBP, as commonly conceived, falters. In this presentation I use an example drawn from personal experience to highlight {{just a few of the}} problematic issues that are thrown up for professionals when an ‘everyday’ search transgresses (as many potentially do) disciplinary boundaries and professional expectations. My presentation focuses on the nebulous quality of ‘relevance’ and ‘evidence’ for practitioners. I conclude by proposing that substantive interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary understanding is difficult and sometimes impossible to achieve for professionals working within social and cultural structures that underscore and maintain disciplinary boundaries...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This article {{assesses the}} use of BeneHold Thin Absorbent Skin Adhesive (TASA) wound {{dressings}} in a large UK primary care organisation. These wound dressings are thin (0. 12 mm), breathable, transparent, {{and are able to}} absorb and retain wound exudate. This non-comparative evaluation was undertaken to explore the clinical advantages this differentiated combination of physical properties offered. Method: The dressings are CE-marked medical devices, and were used on patients with acute and chronic wounds that were assessed and classified as light to moderately exuding. Clinical performance was evaluated with respect to the dressing's ease of use (application and removal, conformability, mould-ability, rolling and edge-lift), debridement, protection of the peri-wound, wear time, fluid handling, wound bed residue, visibility of the wound, and clinical acceptability. The evaluating clinicians used an agreed audit tool to collect data from case reports to document the progression of wounds of various aetiologies, including chronic and acute, for a maximum period of four weeks. Qualitative feedback on dressing performance was also collected at the evaluation's end, both from the clinicians' and patients' perspectives Results: Some 15 patients were assessed. The wear time was up to seven days in many cases, and on average was 3. 9 days longer than their previous dressings. Clinicians perceived that wounds progressed toward healing in all but two cases, where the wounds remained unchanged. Out of five cases where wounds presented with necrosis, all underwent significant autolytic debridement underneath the new dressings. Transparency was a noted benefit from both the clinicians' and patients' perspectives because it enabled continuous monitoring of the full wound bed and peri-wound skin without the need to disrupt the dressing. Conclusion: The dressing was well-received by both clinicians and patients in all fifteen cases. The thin <b>absorbent</b> skin adhesive <b>dressing</b> was found to be a promising new technology that could offer significant advantages to improve the quality, cost, and convenience of wound care. Further work is underway to validate these findings in larger and more homogeneous patient groups. Â© 2014 MA HEALTHCARE LT...|$|R

40|$|Buruli ulcer (BU) is a tropical, {{infectious}} skin disease. The resulting ulcer {{can take}} a long time to heal, and a high standard of wound care is essential.

We performed a pilot implementation project using HydroTac(®) (Hartmann, Heidenheim, Germany), a modern dressing combining foam with a hydrogel component. For future BU treatment, we recommend to use a more <b>absorbent</b> <b>dressing</b> than the HydroTac dressing used in the current project. However, we show that modern dressings can be applied to BUs and that HydroTac dressings yield clean, healing wounds, and prevent the pain and bleeding associated with gauze dressings.

40|$|Introduction: Torso burns {{following}} debridement {{and skin}} grafting usually require fairly complex dressings. The dressing {{consists of an}} interface layer, an absorbent layer and a retaining layer. Although numerous inner dressings are now available from multiple manufacturers, Gamgee dressing (pad of cotton and gauze) is often used as an outer <b>absorbent</b> <b>dressing.</b> Dressing the torso is usually a challenge, {{and the purpose of}} this paper is to present a custom-made over-dressing for torso burns, which reflects the current practice at our centre. Materials and Methods: A U-shape cut is made at one end of the Gamgee to design the shoulder straps. This custom-made dressing is held in place by a custom-designed netted vest. Results: This custom-made over-dressing for the torso was found to be comfortable for patients, easily made from locally available materials, easy to apply, absorbent and not restrictive of movement. The shoulder straps prevent sliding of the Gamgee, and in a nonrestrictive way. The netted vest provides the required compression to keep the Gamgee in firm contact with the inner layers of the dressing without compromising respiration. Conclusion: In this report, we present our practice of a custom-made dressing that is very efficient and economical. We hope that this information will be of practical use to other centres managing burns...|$|E
40|$|Study objective: To compare three {{dressing}} {{types in}} terms of their ability to protect against infection and promote healing, patient comfort, and cost-effectiveness. Design: Prospective, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Major metropolitan, academically affiliated, tertiary referral center. Patients: Seven hundred thirty-seven patients were randomized to receive a dry <b>absorbent</b> <b>dressing</b> (n = 243) [Primapore; Smith & Nephew; Sydney, NSW, Australia], a hydrocolloid dressing (n = 267) [Duoderm Thin ConvaTec; Mulgrave, VIC, Australia], or a hydroactive dressing (n = 227) [Opsite; Smith & Nephew] in the operating theater on skin closure. Results: There was no difference in the rate of wound infection or wound healing between treatment groups. The Primapore dressing was the most comfortable and cost-effective dressing option for the sternotomy wound. Duoderm Thin dressings were associated with increased wound exudate (p < 0. 001), poor dressing integrity (p < 0. 001), more frequent dressing changes (p < 0. 001), more discomfort with removal (p < 0. 05), and increased cost (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: In the context of no additional benefit for the prevention of wound infection or the rate of wound healing for any of the three dressing products examined, dry absorbent dressings are the most comfortable and cost-effective products for sternotomy wounds following cardiac surgery. <br /...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveGroin wound {{infection}} {{is an important}} cause of postoperative morbidity in vascular surgery patients, especially when prosthetic grafts are involved. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate if Prevena (Kinetic Concepts, Inc, San Antonio, Tex), a negative pressure incision management system, could reduce the risk of groin wound infection in patients after vascular surgery. MethodsNinety patients (115 groin incisions) underwent longitudinal or transverse femoral cutdown for vascular procedures. A retrospective chart review was performed on 63 consecutive incisions in patients in the non-Prevena group from December 2009 to November 2010 and on 52 consecutive incisions in patients in the Prevena group from January 2011 to December 2011. Prevena was applied intraoperatively and removed 5 to 7 days postoperatively. The non-Prevena group received either a skin adhesive or <b>absorbent</b> <b>dressing.</b> Groin incisions were assessed, and infection was graded based on Szilagyi classifications. Student t-test and two-sample proportion z test were used for statistical analyses. A P value <. 05 was considered statistically significant. ResultsComorbidities and known risk factors for infection were compared; there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. Prosthetic material was used in 34 (65 %) incisions in the Prevena group and 29 (46 %) incisions in the non-Prevena group. Fifty (96 %) incisions within the Prevena group and 60 (96 %) in the non-Prevena group were classified as clean surgical wounds. Wounds were evaluated at 7 days and 30 days postoperatively. Of 63  groin incisions in 49 patients in the non-Prevena group, 19 (30 %) incisions had groin wound infections. Wound infections were classified into Szilagyi grade I (10; 16 %), Szilagyi grade II (7; 11 %), and Szilagyi grade III (2; 3 %). Of 52  groin incisions in 41 patients in the Prevena group, three (6 %) incisions had Szilagyi grade I wound infections. No grade II or III infections occurred in this group. Overall incidence of infection between the two groups was statistically significant (P =. 0011). ConclusionsIn this clinical study, Prevena negative pressure dressing significantly decreased the incidence of groin wound infection in patients after vascular surgery...|$|E
40|$|As {{one of the}} highest-volume {{vascular}} {{practices on}} the East Coast, the Jefferson Vascular Center (JVC) brings together the physicians, surgeons and pharmacists needed to deliver coordinated, convenient patient care. The JVC’s integrated, multi-disciplinary approach is extremely effective in diagnosing, treating and monitoring vascular diseases (diseases of blood vessels) and thrombotic (bloodclotting) disorders – including complex arterial and vein thrombosis, peripheral artery disease, lymphedema, postthrombotic syndromes, chronic venous insufficiency, varicose veins, vasculitis and congenital vascular conditions. Launched in 2009, the JVC is led by Co-Directors Paul J. DiMuzio, MD, FACS, the William M. Measey Professor of Surgery and Director of the Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Geno Merli, MD, Senior Associate Chief Medical Officer of Thomas Jefferson University Hospital (TJUH), and Laurence Needleman, MD, Associate Professor of Radiology and Director of the Division of Abdominal Imaging. Dr. Merli {{has long been a}} nationally recognized expert in deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a potentially deadly blood clot in the leg. Housed on the sixth floor of the Gibbon Building at 11 th and Chestnut Streets, the JVC recently completed a renovation that tripled its footprint and brought the angioplasty center, staffed by an interventional cardiologist, in close proximity. JVC faculty members also care for patients at Methodist Hospital and in Northeast Philadelphia, serving a total of about 1, 500 patients annually. As a medical specialty, vascular medicine is relatively new. Jefferson’s Taki Galanis, MD, received Board certification in vascular medicine by being sponsored and mentored into the specialty. More recently, physicians have been able to pursue fellowship training. One such specialist is Luis H. Eraso, MD, who joined Jefferson in June 2011 after completing three years of fellowship training at the Cardiovascular Division of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Eraso, who received Jefferson’s Marjorie A. Bowman, MD, ’ 76 Early Career Investigator Award for Primary Care Research for his work on novel biomarkers of peripheral arterial disease, emphasizes the value of an integrated, multi-disciplinary center. “Other programs offer treatment for problems affecting the arterial, venous and lymphatic circulatory systems, but very few do so in one physical location,” he says. “The Jefferson Vascular Center brings together medical, surgical and pharmacy specialists, which offers benefits to patients and improvement in care coordination and delivery. ” Vascular medicine physicians also manage the vascular wound care program, {{an integral part of the}} JVC which provides advanced vascular wound services, such as multilayer compression and <b>absorbent</b> <b>dressing</b> (MCAD) therapy, outpatient surgical debridement, application of bioengineered skin grafts and substitutes, and/or use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Additionally, some of the certified vascular medicine physicians are involved in the interpretation of vascular ultrasound studies performed at the JVC vascular laboratory. Equally important, Dr. Eraso says, are the roles of Walter Kraft, MD, who is board certified in both internal medicine and clinical pharmacology, and Lynda Thomson, PharmD, who joins the vascular medicine physicians in staffing the Jefferson Anticoagulation and Thrombosis Service (JATS). JATS is a busy inpatient and outpatient consult service dedicated to coordinating the transition of care as patients with complex vascular conditions move back into community-based primary care. JATS also provides guidance in the medical management of venous thromboembolic disease in special populations, including pregnant patients. Working closely with Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Jefferson’s high-risk obstetrics team, the medical and pharmacy staff at the JVC helps to manage anticoagulation therapy throughout their pregnancy. “Our multi-disciplinary approach helps prevent overlap in care—ensuring that two specialties within the same system aren’t dealing with the same disease in different ways,” he concludes. “Here, multiple specialists practice side by side. We consult with each other and collaborate in real time, which enables us to provide a more seamless experience and support better outcomes for our patients. ” For more information about the JVC, please visit Jefferson. edu/JV...|$|E
