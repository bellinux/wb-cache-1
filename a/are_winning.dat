5|$|The morale {{system in}} the game is similar to {{previous}} Dynasty Warrior games. Morale is increased and decreased by performing a number of positive actions for the player’s army. Action that produce this effect include defeating enemies in multiples of fifty, defeating enemy officers, and completing special events such as ambushes, siege attacks, and finding enemy strongholds. Morale in the game has a strong effect on the player's forces, determining their strength and speed, {{as well as their}} ability to perform Berwald attacks. Morale will also affect how the CPU characters move along through battle. Example: Ally Oxenstiernas <b>are</b> <b>winning.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adams still {{uses the}} same 26-inch-wide bass drum he began with in 1973. He has stated that he bought {{it as part of}} a set for $25 at a garage sale. It has the same head {{on the side of the}} drum that Adams does not beat, but Adams has stated that he replaces the other side about twice a year and also goes through about three sets of mallets each year. During games, Adams tends to drum at {{particular}} moments: when the Indians take the field at the beginning of the game, if the Indians have runners in scoring position, if the Indians are tied or trailing near the end of the game, or if they <b>are</b> <b>winning</b> at the top of the ninth inning. Because of his drumming, Adams became a celebrity and his drum was soon nicknamed Big Chief Boom-Boom, by Indians radio announcer Herb Score. It has also helped him meet politicians, including U.S. senators and a Pakistani government official.|$|E

The winner is determined not by the snitch catch but by the number of points earned throughout the entirety of the game play.

Teams that are losing will defend the snitch by placing themselves between the Snitch Runner and the opposing seeker.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, if a {{starting}} pitcher on the visiting team is losing the game (despite giving up no hits) after his team bats {{in the top}} of the ninth inning, his team will not take the field again unless they tied or took the lead. By this unusual situation, the starting pitcher will only have pitched eight complete innings with no chance to pitch a ninth inning to attempt a no-hitter. If the starting pitcher is on the home team, he will have a chance to pitch {{in the top of}} the ninth inning—a situation that occurred with Ken Johnson and later the combined efforts of Barber and Miller. However, a winning home team will not bat (and the visiting team will not field) in the bottom of the ninth if they <b>are</b> <b>winning,</b> and the game will end with only 8½ innings played. In 1991, Major League Baseball changed the definition of a no-hitter to require that a pitcher throw at least nine full innings for the no-hitter to be official. With that change, there have been four no-hit performances ruled ineligible despite the pitcher pitching an eight-inning complete game in a losing effort: Silver King (June 21, 1890), Andy Hawkins (July 1, 1990), Matt Young (April 12, 1992), and the combined pitching of Jered Weaver and José Arredondo (June 28, 2008).|$|E

2500|$|By {{the middle}} of 1967 nearly 70,000 Americans had been killed or wounded in the war. In July, Johnson sent McNamara, Wheeler and other {{officials}} to meet with Westmoreland and reach agreement on plans for the immediate future. At that time the war was being commonly described by the press and others as a [...] "stalemate". Westmoreland said such a description was pure fiction, and that [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>winning</b> slowly but steadily and the pace can excel if we reinforce our successes". Though Westmoreland sought many more, Johnson agreed to an increase of 55,000 troops bringing the total to 525,000. In August Johnson, with the Joint Chiefs' support, decided to expand the air campaign and exempted only Hanoi, Haiphong and a buffer zone with China from the target list. In September Ho Chi Minh and North Vietnamese premier Pham Van Dong appeared amenable to French mediation, so Johnson ceased bombing in a 10-mile zone around Hanoi; this was met with dissatisfaction. Johnson in a Texas speech agreed to halt all bombing if Ho Chi Minh would launch productive and meaningful discussions and if North Vietnam would not seek {{to take advantage of}} the halt; this was named the [...] "San Antonio" [...] formula. There was no response, but Johnson pursued the possibility of negotiations with such a bombing pause.|$|E
2500|$|Sonnet 64 is a {{great example}} of why people always say [...] "You should never let your past {{interfere}} with your present". Barret argues that sonnet 64 [...] "provides an example of past-oriented natural habitats that might interfere with the productive considerations of the future". In other words, because the speaker is letting the past overwhelm his thoughts, he therefore cannot think positively about the future due to past habits or tendencies. Unlike some of the other sonnets addressed to the young man, sonnet 64 moves toward a feeling of the lover's exposure to the risk of being destroyed. Barret also argues that the phonetic play between ruminate and ruinate is as she says an [...] "underscore a relationship inherent in the poem’s logic", [...] "Each quatrain of the sonnet open with the same construction — [...] "When I have seen" [...] — yet these statements are never met with a summational [...] "then", so the temporal ambiguity the phrase creates the remains unresolved: Does the speaker gesture toward repeated past actions ('in the instances that I have seen') or forward to a causational limit point ('once I have seen')?". When we read the lines that pertain to the waves and the shore, [...] "at times the waves <b>are</b> <b>winning</b> against the shore, and then at times the shore is winning against the waves", the speaker almost speaks in a tone of confidence and determination to not let time control his life. Although when he goes to say Time will take my love away we begin {{to get a sense of}} uncertainty within the speaker. This uncertainty within the speaker is described by Barret when she argues [...] "The sonnet registers temporal matters in personal terms; the couplet never corrects the poem's grammatically obscured engagement with time, but instead introduces a paralyzing temporal collapse: the present moment becomes overwhelmed by an anticipation of future loss—an extreme version of 'I miss you already.'.... The ruin/ruminate pairing bespeaks a suspicion of an imagined time spent looking back".|$|E
