5|$|To African Americans, {{the story}} of the Exodus was perhaps the central story, the most {{powerful}} image about emerging from the grip of bondage to reach for liberty and human dignity – a tale that was carried from slavery through the Civil Rights Movement into today. For me, personally, growing up in far-flung parts of the world and without firm roots, the story spoke to <b>a</b> <b>yearning</b> within every human being for a home.|$|E

5|$|In his youth, Stojanović wrote poems, {{only one}} of which is published—in a 1918 issue of the {{literary}} magazine Književni jug, whose editor was future Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić. For this poem, Stojanović was inspired by the Serbian epic hero Ailing Dojčin. A number of Stojanović's poems are preserved in a notebook that belonged to his closest school friend Todor Ilić. According to the poet Dragan Kolundžija, Stojanović's poems are lyrical miniatures composed in free verse, focused on man and nature, and filled with melancholy. Kolundžija finds that what inspired Stojanović to write poetry is reflected in his verse Krvav je bol (Pain is bloody). According to poet Miroslav Feldman, who first met Stojanović in 1919 in Zagreb, his poems were sad and permeated with <b>a</b> <b>yearning</b> for a brighter, more joyous life.|$|E

Her most notable works are a classic {{collection}} of short stories, the Heptameron, and a remarkably intense religious poem, Miroir de l'âme pécheresse (Mirror of the Sinful Soul). This poem is a first-person, mystical narrative of the soul as <b>a</b> <b>yearning</b> woman calling out to Christ as her father-brother-lover. Her work was passed to the royal court of England, suggesting that Marguerite had influence on the Protestant Reformation in England.|$|E
25|$|Since the Portuguese {{wanted to}} keep the line of {{demarcation}} of Alcaçovas running east and west along a latitude south of Cape Bojador, a compromise was worked out and incorporated in the Treaty of Tordesillas, dated on 7 June 1494, in which the globe was split into two hemispheres dividing Spanish and Portuguese claims. These actions gave Spain exclusive rights to establish colonies in all of the New World from north to south (except Brazil), as well as the easternmost parts of Asia. The treaty of Tordesillas was confirmed by Pope Julius II in the bull Ea quae pro bono pacis on 24 January 1506. Spain's expansion and colonization was driven by economic influences, <b>a</b> <b>yearning</b> to improve national prestige, and a desire to spread Catholicism into the New World.|$|E
500|$|The {{completion}} of Redguard in 1998 {{led to a}} return to the Morrowind project, as the developers felt <b>a</b> <b>yearning</b> in their audience to return to the classically epic forms of the earlier titles. Finding that the gaps between their own technical capacities and those of rival companies had grown in the interim, Bethesda sought to revitalize itself and return to the forefront of the industry, an effort spearheaded by project leader Todd Howard. The XnGine was scrapped and replaced with a licensed copy of NetImmerse, a Direct3D powered engine, with transform and lighting capacity, 32-bit textures and skeletal animation. During their promotional campaign, Bethesda deliberately paralleled their screenshot releases with the announcement of NVIDIA's GeForce 4, as [...] "being indicative of the outstanding water effects the technology is capable of".|$|E

500|$|The film {{features}} the 1950 Marc Chagall painting La Mariée. Anna sees a {{print of the}} painting in William's home and later gives him what is presumably the original. Michell said in Entertainment Weekly that the painting was chosen because Curtis was a fan of Chagall's work and because La Mariée [...] "depicts <b>a</b> <b>yearning</b> for something that's lost." [...] The producers had a reproduction made for the film, but had to get permission from the owner as well as clearance from the Design and Artists Copyright Society. Finally, according to Kenworthy, [...] "we had to agree to destroy it. They were concerned that if our fake was too good, it might float around the market and create problems."

[...] Soniah Kamal of Atlanta Arts was particularly favorable towards Amra, the Bosnian aid worker who cares for and adopts Roshi, as she [...] "stuns with her hope in humanity no matter what callousness she has witnessed". USA Today critic Kevin Nance found the story of Abdullah and Pari [...] "devastating" [...] but thought the large cast of characters, [...] "including some introduced fairly late in the proceedings, when the reader just wants to return to the core cast", was excessive.|$|E
500|$|In 1913 Holloway was {{recruited}} by the comedian Leslie Henson to feature as a support in Henson's more prestigious concert party called Nicely, Thanks. In later life, Holloway often spoke of his admiration for Henson, citing him as a great influence on his career. The two became firm friends and often consulted each other before taking jobs. In his 1967 autobiography, Holloway dedicated a whole chapter to Henson, whom he described as [...] "the greatest friend, inspiration and mentor a performer could have had". Later in 1913, Holloway decided to train as an operatic baritone, and {{so he went to}} Italy to take singing lessons from Ferdinando Guarino in Milan. However, <b>a</b> <b>yearning</b> to start a career in light entertainment and a contract to re-appear in Bert Graham and Will Bentley's concert party at the West Cliff Theatre caused him to return home after six months.|$|E

Chris Lombardi of Computer Gaming World praised the multiplayer mode, {{saying that it}} [...] "promises to be extraordinarily rich and subtle". His conclusion was that Dungeon Keeper is [...] "The most unique game in years; stylish, multifaceted, and as deep as the pits of hell". Game Revolution reviewer agreed with Lombardi by believing that [...] "Dungeon Keeper is a revolutionary, terrific game", and also complimented the [...] "terrific" [...] graphics and the [...] "nearly as impressive" [...] sound. Gamezilla's Chris McDonald called the game a [...] "classic" [...] and concluded, [...] "Any real-time gamer with <b>a</b> <b>yearning</b> for the dungeon life and the nerve to slaughter an army of Monks, Fairies and Lords will be pleasantly surprised with Dungeon Keeper". PC Gamer UK's James Flynn praised Bullfrog's attention to detail, calling it [...] "amazing", and reiterated others' views by describing Dungeon Keeper as [...] "A stunning achievement".|$|E
500|$|Like in The Kampung Boy, {{the scenes}} in Yesterday and Today are {{presented}} in great detail. [...] Lat shows the children playing with items constructed from simple items found in the household and nature. [...] He also illustrates the toys' schematics. [...] He compares the games with their modern counterparts, lamenting the loss of creativity in modern youths. [...] Other comments on societal changes are in the book. [...] A child is taking a swimming lesson in a pool, intently watched by his parents who have a maid in tow with various items in her hands. [...] While the parents gesticulate wildly at their son, the lifeguard and instructor calmly sit by the pool, watching the boy's smooth progress. [...] This scene is contrasted with Lat's own experience {{at the hands of}} his father, who casually tosses the terrified boy into a river, letting him either swim or flounder. [...] Such details, according to Muliyadi, invoke <b>a</b> <b>yearning</b> for the past and help readers [...] "better appreciate [...] cartoons".|$|E
500|$|The album's {{opening track}} and third single, [...] "Drowned World/Substitute For Love" [...] is a downtempo ballad drawing {{influences}} from jungle, drum and bass and trip hop music. The title {{is inspired by}} J.G. Ballard's post-apocalyptic science fiction novel The Drowned World (1962). [...] "Swim", the second song, has a spiritual tone. She sings: [...] "Swim to the ocean floor/So that we can begin again/Wash away all our sins/Crash to the other shore". [...] "Ray of Light", the third track and album's second single, is an up-tempo electronic dance-pop song which contains strong techno tendencies and influences of trance music. A [...] "sonically progressive" [...] track, it also incorporates elements of rock music, with a prominent electric guitar riff. The melody also has several sound effects, including whistles and bleeps. [...] "Candy Perfume Girl" [...] has a grunge intro and continues to pair post-modern beeps and beats with old-fashioned electric guitar flare ups. In the next song, [...] "Skin", Madonna sings [...] "Do I know you from somewhere?" [...] in <b>a</b> <b>yearning</b> voice over the beats of an electronic orchestra. The sixth track, [...] "Nothing Really Matters", is an up-tempo dance track which contains influences of techno.|$|E

500|$|Highway 61 Revisited {{opens with}} [...] "Like a Rolling Stone", {{which has been}} {{described}} as revolutionary in its combination of electric guitar licks, organ chords, and Dylan's voice, [...] "at once so young and so snarling... and so cynical". Michael Gray characterized [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] as [...] "a chaotic amalgam of blues, impressionism, allegory, and an intense directness: 'How does it feel?'" [...] Polizzotti writes that the composition is notable for eschewing traditional themes of popular music, such as romance, and instead expresses resentment and <b>a</b> <b>yearning</b> for revenge. It has been suggested that Miss Lonely, the song's central character, is based on Edie Sedgwick, a socialite and actress in the Factory scene of pop artist Andy Warhol. Critic Mike Marqusee has written that this composition is [...] "surely a Dylan cameo", and that its full poignancy becomes apparent upon the realization that [...] "it is sung, at least in part, to the singer himself: he's the one 'with no direction home'." [...] "Like A Rolling Stone" [...] reached numbertwo in the Billboard Hot 100 in the summer of 1965, and was a top-10 hit in [...] Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|The {{image of}} life as a sea voyage to the Kingdom of Heaven in the first recitative comes from the opening of the Gospel reading: [...] "There He went on board a ship and passed over and came into His own city" [...] (...) [...] Affirmations that God will not forsake the {{faithful}} on this journey and will lead them out of tribulation come from [...] and [...] The third movement expresses the joy at being united with the Saviour; the text comes from : [...] "Those that wait upon the Lord shall gain new strength so that they mount up with wings like an eagle, so that they run and do not grow weary." [...] This joy is coupled with <b>a</b> <b>yearning</b> for death, a theme that is present until {{the very end of the}} work. The concluding chorale is the sixth stanza of Johann Franck's hymn [...] "" [...] (1653), which also alludes to the ship imagery, saying [...] "Löse meines Schiffleins Ruder, bringe mich an sichern Port" [...] (release the rudder of my little ship, bring me to the secure harbor). Before the chorale, the final lines of the opening aria taken from Revelation 7:17 ("there my Savior himself will wipe away my tears") are heard once more.|$|E
500|$|The text by Christoph Birkmann {{reflects}} {{life of the}} Christian as {{a voluntary}} journey [...] "carrying the cross" [...] as a follower of Jesus. The text refers indirectly to the prescribed gospel reading which tells that Jesus traveled by boat, which {{on the other hand}} refers to a navigational instrument called Kreuzstab, the Jacob's staff. The poet used the imagery to liken life to a sea voyage, finally reflecting <b>a</b> <b>yearning</b> for death to reach the ultimate destination. The yearning for death is re-enforced by the choice of a closing chorale, the stanza [...] "" [...] (Come, o death, you brother of sleep) from Johann Franck's 1653 hymn [...] "" [...] which also relates to the ship voyage imagery. Bach, who composed the cantata in his fourth year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, structured the cantata in five movements, alternating arias and recitatives for a bass soloist and closing with a four-part chorale, and chose a Baroque instrumental ensemble of three woodwind instruments (two oboes and taille) playing mostly with three string instruments (two violins and viola), and continuo, with an obbligato cello in the first recitative and an obbligato oboe in the second aria, resulting in different timbres for the four movements for the same voice part.|$|E

500|$|The two {{contradictory}} responses {{found in}} the first and second scenes of [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] are inadequate for completely describing art, because Keats believed that art should not provide history or ideals. Instead, both are replaced with a philosophical tone that dominates the meditation on art. The sensual aspects are replaced with an emphasis on the spiritual aspects, and the last scene describes a world contained unto itself. The relationship between the audience with the world is for benefiting or educating, but merely to emphatically connect to the scene. In the scene, the narrator contemplates where the boundaries of art lie and how much an artist can represent on an urn. The questions the narrator asks reveal <b>a</b> <b>yearning</b> to understand the scene, but the urn is too limited to allow such answers. Furthermore, the narrator is able to visualise more than what actually exists on the urn. This conclusion on art is both satisfying, in that it allows the audience to actually connect with the art, and alienating, as it does not provide the audience the benefit of instruction or narcissistic fulfilment. Besides the contradictions between the various desires within the poem, there are other paradoxes that emerge as the narrator compares his world with that of the figures on the urn. In the opening line, he refers to the urn as a [...] "bride of quietness", which serves to contrast the urn with the structure of the ode, a type of poem originally intended to be sung. Another paradox arises when the narrator describes immortals on the side of an urn meant to carry the ashes of the dead.|$|E
