It is demonstrated that interactive computer <b>aided</b> <b>testing</b> either by touch CRT's or personal computers is a useful research and training device for measuring pilot information management in diagnosing system failures in simulated flight situations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the extent to which {{incontinence}} aids, used in local authority/municipal nursing homes, were adapted to the resident’s urine-leakage volume and to find out how nurses perceived the current situation concerning individual <b>testing</b> of incontinence <b>aids</b> in municipal nursing homes. The study method was a quantitative empirical study and was carried out in two phases. The first phase was a weighing test, carried out in three nursing homes, whereby the incontinence aids used by 25 residents during a 48 hour period were weighed. The second phase was the completion of a questionnaire by the municipal nurses working in the same local authority. The questionnaire covered: the division of responsibilities; routines for <b>testing</b> incontinence <b>aids,</b> and the level of knowledge concerning individual incontinence <b>aid</b> <b>testing.</b> Only 22 % of the pads used during the observation were properly adapted to the patients’ urinary leakage volume, while 76 % of incontinence aids were larger than necessary in relation to the real volume of urinary leakage. The municipal nurses, who have a key role and formal responsibility for individual incontinence <b>aid</b> <b>testing,</b> considered that there was insufficient knowledge within the organisation concerning individual incontinence <b>aid</b> <b>testing,</b> and that the division of responsibilities in this area was unclear. There were great variations relating to the extent of the nurses’ involvement in individual incontinence <b>aid</b> <b>testing,</b> and the nurses stated that increased involvement in individual incontinence <b>aid</b> <b>testing</b> was dependent on more time being made available for this task. Only a minority of the nurses thought that the requisitioning of incontinence aids was preceded by individual testing of the incontinence pads within the organisation. The majority of nurses considered that this was not the case or were unsure of the situation...|$|R

40|$|Low power {{consumption}} {{in a digital}} circuit {{can be achieved by}} partitioning it into sub-circuits which can be turned off at their inactive states. State encoding process can also reduce the power requirement considerably. Switching activity in a sequential logic circuit can be effectively reduced by Clock-gating techniques. In this work, the given circuit is modeled as finite-state machine and its decomposition is formulated into submachine as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. The {{power consumption}} is further reduced by a simple, but powerful state encoding method. The original circuit is decomposed into two structural sub circuits. Computer <b>Aided</b> <b>Testing</b> (CAT) environment is strategically applied in testing each of this sub circuit successively. The average power consumption resulted from the switching activity time interval is minimized by the process of partitioning the circuit and test session planning. In order to reduce the average switching activity, the small cluster of states having high stationary state probability is sought out, for creating the small sub-finite state machine.
