Hoyt said she had cooperated with the Family because she was [...] "trying {{to keep them from}} killing my family." [...] She stated that, {{at the time of the}} trial, she was [...] "constantly being threatened: 'Your family's gonna die. [...] could be repeated <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E

[...] In the next week 25,258 cards and letters arrived from 45 of the 48 states, and the show {{typically}} received 6,000 letters each week.

2500|$|Unlike {{previous}} first-person shooters in the Halo franchise, Halo 5: Guardians {{does not}} feature any offline capabilities, including split-screen cooperative campaign and multiplayer modes; {{it also does}} not have any local networking options. Microsoft Studios corporate vice president Phil Spencer commented on the lack of split-screen, stating [...] "We see the robustness of what Xbox Live is today and where people are playing across Xbox Live—you <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>house,</b> me at our house. We know that's {{the vast majority of the}} co-op play. With Halo 5, the team really wanted to focus on making that experience great, both visually on the screen that you're looking at, and all the systems in place." ...|$|E

2500|$|More {{and more}} Thérèse {{realised}} {{that she felt}} no attraction to the exalted heights of [...] "great souls". She looked directly for the word of Jesus, which shed light on her prayers and on her daily life. Thérèse's retreat in October 1892 pointed out to her a [...] "downward" [...] path. If asked where she lived, she reflected, must not she {{be able to answer}} with Christ, [...] "The foxes have their lairs, the birds of heaven their nests, but I have no place to rest my head." [...] (Matthew 8:20). She wrote to Céline (letter 19 October 1892), [...] "Jesus raised us above all the fragile things of this world whose image passes away. Like Zacchaeus, we climbed a tree to see Jesus and now let us listen to what he is saying to us. Make haste to descend, I must lodge today <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>house.</b> Well, Jesus tells us to descend?" [...] "A question here of the interior," [...] she qualified in her letter, lest Céline think she meant renouncing food or shelter. [...] "Thérèse knew her virtues, even her love, to be flawed, flawed by self, a mirror too clouded to reflect the divine." [...] She continued to seek to discover the means, [...] "to more efficiently strip herself of self." [...] "No doubt, [...] are already empty of creatures, but, alas, I feel mine is not entirely empty of myself, and {{it is for this reason}} that Jesus tells me to descend." ...|$|E
