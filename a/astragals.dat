5000|$|The word [...] "astragal" [...] {{comes from}} the Greek and Latin for [...] "vertebra," [...] and the {{original}} <b>astragals</b> used in architecture were made in a beaded design, thereby resembling a vertebra.|$|E
50|$|Extending onto both front verandahs is a bay window. Verandah {{balustrading}} is cast-iron, and poles with <b>astragals</b> {{support the}} brokenback verandah roof. Short balustraded steps {{lead to the}} central front door which has glass sidelights. Another front door gives access to the central hallway which has two rooms on either side. The two front bay window rooms are smaller {{than the other two}} rooms.|$|E
50|$|An <b>astragal</b> is a {{moulding}} profile {{composed of}} a half-round surface surrounded by two flat planes (fillets). An <b>astragal</b> is {{sometimes referred to as}} a miniature torus. It can be an architectural element used at the top or base of a column, but is also employed as a framing device on furniture and woodwork.|$|R
40|$|The Navy <b>astragal</b> {{represents}} the vessels {{used in the}} Civil War. Bowsprits of the vessels extend ten feet beyond the stone work. It was designed by George W. Brewster of Cleveland, Ohio. The Army <b>astragal</b> {{represents the}} implements and carnage of war and is twelve feet high. It was designed by Nicolaus Geiger of Berlin, Germany...|$|R

5000|$|An {{astragal}} {{is commonly}} used to seal between a pair of doors. The astragal closes the clearance gap created by bevels on one or both mating doors, and helps deaden sound. The vertical member (molding) attaches to a stile on one {{of a pair of}} either sliding or swinging doors, against which the other door seals when closed. Exterior <b>astragals</b> are kerfed for weatherstripping.|$|E
50|$|The {{courthouse}} is a two-story, 5-by-8-bay rectangular gable-roofed frame building, with clapboard siding on {{the north}} and south sides and horizontal planks on its west (front) facade. The pedimented gable is supported by the four Corinthian columns, behind which is the main entrance, with molded classical detail. Similar ornamentation {{can be found on the}} window lintels. The two front corners have large pilasters; the original stone plinth blocks have been replaced with concrete copies and the <b>astragals</b> taken down to help prevent dry rot in the columns.|$|E
5000|$|Older {{buildings}} have generally a rough shape, a limited decoration with a mixing of styles ( [...] eclecticism), {{characteristic of the}} second half of the 19th century. Facades are generally horizontally by cornices, especially on the top of buildings. They are often decorated with classical ornaments such as: <b>astragals,</b> cymatia, meanders, palmette friezes and triglyphes. Vertical façade articulations are realized through columns, pillars and pilasters. Some houses are adorned with pediments including tondi or allegorical statues.Columns and pilasters also appear in window frames and door openings, usually topped by a frontage and more rarely with decorated friezes.|$|E

5|$|The chase girdle: this is {{the brief}} length of the chase between the chase <b>astragal</b> and fillets and the reinforce.|$|R
50|$|The {{memorial}} {{includes several}} notable outdoor sculptures, including Rudolph Schwarz's two massive limestone groupings of War and Peace, two smaller scenes named The Dying Soldier and The Return Home, and four military figures at its base. Three <b>astragals,</b> one by Nikolaus (Nicolaus) Geiger {{and two others}} by George T. Brewster, surround the stone obelisk. Additional sculptures include John H. Mahoney's bronze statues of George Rogers Clark, William Henry Harrison, and James Whitcomb, and Franklin Simmons's bronze statue of Oliver P. Morton. Brewster's 30 ft bronze statue of Victory crowns the obelisk. The Indianapolis monument is approximately 15 ft shorter than New York City's 305 ft Statue of Liberty.|$|E
50|$|Three bronze <b>astragals,</b> one by Nikolaus Geiger and two by George Brewster, {{surround}} the stone obelisk. The first astragal is placed 70 ft above the obelisk's base. The second astragal is 12 ft above the first. The third astragal is 80 ft above the base, below the capital. Geiger, of Berlin, Germany, cast and shipped the first astragal, a battlefield {{scene of the}} army, from Germany. He never saw the monument at Indianapolis and died before its completion. Brewster, an American sculptor from Cleveland, Ohio, created the second astragal with a naval theme that includes a portrait relief of Admiral David Farragut. Brewster also designed the third astragal with the dates 1861 and 1865, the Civil War’s beginning and ending dates.|$|E
50|$|The {{verandah}} edges rest on 25 cm high {{brick walls}} and are capped with painted timber boards. The posts {{are divided into}} two parts by stop chamfering, and have <b>astragals,</b> capitals and carved timber brackets. On the east-facing edge, a low timber seat fits between each post and forms a simple balustrade. The verandah area's floor is clad in narrow shot-edge timber boards and is approximately 3m wide. The exposed underside of its curved roof is not supported by rafters, except where a hip occurs, such as where the barrel-roofed entry porch intersects with it. The verandah area looking north is partially enclosed by timber framing that supports some fixed glass, a sliding glass door and a low weatherboard-clad balustrade. All timberwork, except that lining the floor, is painted.|$|E
5|$|The chase <b>astragal</b> and fillets: {{these are}} a second series of such rings located at the near end of the chase.|$|R
50|$|<b>Astragal</b> — A {{semi-circular}} molding {{attached to}} one {{of a pair of}} especially fire doors to cover the air gap where the doors meet.|$|R
5000|$|Torus — Convex, {{semi-circular}} molding, {{larger than}} an <b>astragal,</b> {{often at the}} base of a column, which may be enriched with leaves or plaiting.|$|R
5000|$|The light sits on {{a square}} {{reinforced}} concrete pier, 30 ft high and 64 ft on a side. [...] Atop the pier is a two-story base, 15 ft high and 30 ft on a side. [...] The cellar and first floor in the base were built to house diesel generators, boilers, and compressors to provide power and heat to the light, fog signal, and keeper's quarters. [...] The {{second floor of the}} base housed the keeper's quarters. The lighthouse tower is placed {{in the center of the}} building roof. The tower is 17 ft tall, and tapers from 16 ft at the base to 10 ft beneath the gallery. The entire light is covered on the exterior with steel plates. [...] The lantern atop the tower has helical <b>astragals,</b> and housed a red 3-1/2 order Fresnel lens.|$|E
5000|$|Though much altered, {{this is one}} of Scotland's most {{beautiful}} ancient churches. According to Crail Parish Church's website (see external link below) in its first form the church building consisted of an unaisled rectangular nave and chancel of romanesque design. In the early 13th century a fine western tower with small spire was added, and a double arcade of round pillars of variegated red sandstone in the nave. It was in this form in 1243 that the church was dedicated to St Maelrubha by the Bishop of St Andrews. (In later times it was known as St Mary's probably after a later dedication in a later period that disliked vestiges of the Celtic Church.) The side walls were rebuilt in Regency times, and the large pointed windows, filled with panes of clear glass held by <b>astragals</b> rather than leads, allow light to flood into the interior. The unaisled chancel, now housing a huge organ, has been shortened. The church retains some 17th-century woodwork. The early Christian cross-slab mentioned at the start of this article is on display in the church: it is of unusual form (perhaps 10th century), formerly set in the floor. The church building is open on some afternoons in the summer.|$|E
50|$|The large main {{entrance}} doorways are generally round arch openings symmetrically placed in gable ends and often flanking a smaller central window. Long side window and door openings are generally of the segmental arch headed type with multi-pane windows in carefully detailed cast iron frames, <b>astragals,</b> and pivoting sections. Door and window dressings are {{a combination of}} Helidon freestone, brickwork, or cement render usually with restrained use of coloured brick or stone voussoirs and keystones, raking arches and label moulds.In {{the early years of}} the twentieth century, well designed and finely detailed industrial brick structures such as the Power House, Erecting and Boiler Shops were constructed, completing the intended lateral expansion along the northern and southern sides of the Traverser. These buildings continued the style of the 1880s buildings, some with affinities to Romanesque detail. The final result, when viewed along the strong central axis of the Traverser, is a streetscape of robust brick industrial buildings. Each facade exhibits subtle variations on a simple architectural theme, and although the roof lines vary from simple pitched roofs to extensive saw tooth profiles, there is a great subtlety of scale and material texture which is aesthetically pleasing and impressive.The influence of quality engineering practice, upon the designs for the North Ipswich Railway Workshops is clearly evident in the drawings and specifications produced at this time.|$|E
50|$|Baguette — Thin, {{half-round}} molding, {{smaller than}} an <b>astragal,</b> sometimes carved, and enriched with foliages, pearls, ribbands, laurels, etc. When enriched with ornaments, {{it was also}} called chapelet.|$|R
5|$|The muzzle <b>astragal</b> and fillets are {{a series}} of three narrow rings running around the outside of the chase just behind the neck. Sometimes also collectively called the chase ring.|$|R
5000|$|Fluting — Vertical, {{half-round}} grooves {{cut into}} {{the surface of a}} column in regular intervals, each separated by a flat <b>astragal.</b> This ornament was used for all but the Tuscan order ...|$|R
5000|$|Phrygillus, was {{an ancient}} Greek artist, {{who appears to}} {{have been one of the}} most ancient, as well as one of the most celebrated medallists and {{engravers}} of precious stones. There is a very beautiful intaglio by him, representing Love seated and supporting himself on the ground, in the attitude of those figures of boys playing the game of <b>astragals,</b> which so often occurs in the works of ancient art. The form of the letters of the name ΦΡVΓΙΛΛ, the large size of the wings of the figure of Love, and the whole style of the gem, concur to show that the artist belonged to the earlier Greek school. There is also engraved upon this gem a bivalve shell, which also occurs on the coins of Syracuse whence it may be inferred that the artist was a Syracusan. This conjecture becomes a certainty through the fact, recently published by Raoul-Rochette, that there exist medals of Syracuse, on which the name of Phrygillus is inscribed. One medal of this type is in the possession of R. Rochette himself, who has given an engraving of it on the title-page of his Lettre a M. Schorn, by the side of an engraving of the gem already mentioned. Another medal of this type is in the collection of the Due de Luynes. The same collection contains another very beautiful Syracusan medal, in bronze, bearing the inscription ΦΡΥ, which no one can now hesitate to recognise as the initial letters of the name Phrygillus. Raoul-Rochette accounts these three medals to be among the most precious remains of ancient numismatic art.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the discovery of}} 25 abraded and perforated ovicaprid <b>astragals</b> in a burned house at the Gumelnita Copper Age settlement at Iepuresti in Southern Romania. They were analysed {{in terms of their}} processing, of the taphonomic processes that affected them (burning), and of their spatial distribution. These <b>astragals</b> were also analysed in the wider context of more or less similar discoveries made mainly south and east of the Carpathian Mountains, in Romania, but also south of the Danube, in Bulgaria...|$|E

50|$|An <b>astragal</b> {{may also}} {{be known as a}} “meeting stile seal”. It is {{sometimes}} confused with the wooden trim that divides the panes of a multi-light window or door, known as a muntin.|$|R
50|$|An annulet is also {{a narrow}} flat moulding, common {{in other parts of}} a column, viz. the bases, etc., as well as the capital. It is so called, because it {{encompasses}} the column round. In this sense, annulet is frequently used for baguette or little <b>astragal.</b>|$|R
25|$|Rebated doors, a term chiefly used in Britain, are {{double doors}} having a lip or overlap (i.e. a Rabbet) on the {{vertical}} edge(s) where they meet. Fire-rating {{can be achieved}} with an applied edge-guard or <b>astragal</b> molding on the meeting stile, {{in accordance with the}} American Fire door.|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{variation}} of 16 white and yellow astragal accessions collected from three protected regions of Isfahan province (Mooteh, Kolah-Ghazi and Ghamishloo) were evaluated using ISSR marker. Nine ISSR primers produced 221 bands in which 204 were polymorphic among astragal accessions. ISSR banding patterns were transformed into binary data of presence–absence and matrices were processed with NTSYS Ver. 2 software. Mantel correspondence {{tests were conducted}} to select the best similarity coefficient. Dendrogram was constructed using the simple matching coefficient with unweighted pair group mathematical average (UPGMA). Cluster analysis showed the presence of two large and five small groups and the PCoA data confirmed the results of clustering. Results showed that white <b>astragals</b> have more genetic similarity but yellow <b>astragals</b> have more genetic diversity and {{it is necessary to}} improve their systematic identification. The highest gene diversity was observed in Kolah-Ghazi (0. 366) and the least gene diversity belonged to Moote (0. 129). So, the regions with low gene diversity (e. g. Mooteh) should be more protected in relation to astragal accessions and it is necessary to apply genetic conservation strategies in these regions...|$|E

40|$|Radix astragali (root of Astragalus membranaceus) is an {{important}} traditional Chinese medicine. It {{has been used as}} a tonic herb for thousands of years in China. The water extract of the roots has a wide range of immunopotentiating effects and has been proven to be efficacious as an adjunct cancer therapy. Authentication of the herbal plant is routinely required for general practice in the field of herbal medicine. To facilitate rapid identification of numerous varieties of Radix <b>astragals</b> that are circulating on the herb markets, a rapid molecular genetic method, named 3 ' untranslated region (3 ' UTR) sequence-based amplified polymorphism (UAP), has been developed. A cDNA library was first built from transcripts of an authentic A. membranaceus species. Several cDNA clones specific to A. membranaceus were identified through subtractive hybridization of the A. membranaceus cDNA library with Arabidopsis total cellular RNA. On the basis of these cDNA sequences of the 3 ' untranslated region (3 ' UTR) of selected cDNA clones, a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed on genomic DNAs of the dry roots of several putative A. membranaceus. PCR fragment length polymorphism was found between A. membranaceus and its relatives. By using this method, it was possible to differentiate the authentic A. membranaceus root from those putative ones obtained from herbal medicine markets. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper applying UAP in the authentication of traditional Chinese medicine plants...|$|E
