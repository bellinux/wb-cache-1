5000|$|The {{compilation}} {{features the}} previously unreleased song [...] "Peterborough" [...] and an alternate version of [...] "Separated By Motorways". This version of [...] "Separated By Motorways" [...] {{differs from the}} single release, with the group opting to include <b>Alan</b> <b>Smyth's</b> demo version instead. The compilation also features rare information, pictures and early interviews with the band.|$|R
5000|$|The band's song [...] "Alpha" [...] was {{included}} in Alt Delete's era defining compilation Digital Penetration in 2006. In April 2007, the band released [...] "Gaunt/Plan A" [...] on Mother Tongue. The song was recorded by the Sheffield musician/producer <b>Alan</b> <b>Smyth</b> and was Steve Lamacq's single of the week on his Monday night Radio 1 new music show.|$|R
5000|$|In early 2011, The Violet May toured in Germany with The Chapman Family before {{releasing}} {{their debut}} EP entitled [...] "TV", {{along with a}} single of the same name. The EP was recorded in Sheffield's 2Fly Studios with producer <b>Alan</b> <b>Smyth,</b> who had previously worked with other notable bands from the city including Pulp, Arctic Monkeys, Reverend & The Makers, Richard Hawley and The Long Blondes.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, a distraught woman, Bernie (Shelly Cole), and her boyfriend, Nick (<b>Alan</b> <b>Smyth),</b> {{show up at}} the {{hospital}} where Jeanne works to see her brother, who was brought in earlier. The woman's behavior elicits suspicions from Jeanne (Scottie Thompson), and the man eventually dies and is taken down to the morgue. It becomes apparent that the dead man had been body packing heroin and that the bags had burst, killing him.|$|R
50|$|<b>Alan</b> <b>Smyth</b> is a music {{producer}} from Sheffield, England. He {{has worked}} {{with a number of}} bands, including Pulp, Arctic Monkeys, Reverend and The Makers, The Long Blondes, Milburn, Richard Hawley, The Scaramanga Six, Smokers Die Younger, Monkey Swallows the Universe, The Lodger, Little Man Tate, 65daysofstatic, Little Lost David, Albany, Dead Like Harry, The Silverfish, The Magi, Dead World Leaders, Little Ze, Jack's Attic, Smiling Ivy, Pink Sharabang and The Hurriers. He works from his own studio in the city, 2fly Studios.|$|R
50|$|Barradale {{continued}} to record and perform {{from his native}} Sheffield, teaming up with guitarist and songwriter <b>Alan</b> <b>Smyth,</b> later a producer based at his own 2-Fly Studios in the city. Their bands Fruit, Seafruit, were championed by broadcaster Jeff Cooper's 'XS' show (now radio2XS) at the radio station Hallam FM, where they recorded two sessions in 1996 and 1997. Cooper also employed Barradale as the narrator of a 1995 radio documentary for the BBC Sheffield Music 1995, which also featured Pulp's Jarvis Cocker and others.|$|R
5000|$|The Scaramanga Six’s sixth album, Cursed, (described by {{the band}} as [...] "our magnum hopeless" [...] and {{featuring}} the reworked material from A Pound of Flesh) {{was released in}} 2011. Produced by <b>Alan</b> <b>Smyth,</b> it featured guest appearances from Thomas Truax, playing (amongst other things) his Hornicator and Dracula’s Eyeball instruments. The album generated two further singles - [...] "Autopsy of the Mind" [...] (which [...] "dissect(ed) a failed relationship in CSI: Huddersfield style") and [...] "Trouble" [...] (a further fundraising release for Tim Smith's medical funds which was backed with the band's cover of Cardiacs' [...] "Everything is Easy"). It also included [...] "Walking Through Houses", the 2008 single from the previous Tim Smith sessions.|$|R
5000|$|The band {{recorded}} a remix called [...] "Kisspower" [...] with <b>Alan</b> <b>Smyth</b> of Fon Studios in November 1986, using Fons Akai S900 sampler. It included {{samples from the}} Prince original, Bruce Springsteen, Run-D.M.C. and other artists. Virgin wanted to release it but it was vetoed by Simon Draper of Virgin America over copyright concerns. It was eventually released as a run of 500 white label promotional copies. It {{would have been one}} of the first mainstream sample-based singles, six months before [...] "Pump Up the Volume" [...] and [...] "Say Kids What Time Is It?". [...] "Kisspower" [...] was acclaimed as a [...] "landmark" [...] and a [...] "cutnpaste trailblazer" [...] by musicians magazine Electronic Sound.|$|R
5000|$|The {{title track}} is co-written by Alex Turner {{of the band}} Arctic Monkeys: {{frontman}} Jon McClure are good friends, {{to the point of}} sharing a flat in Sheffield, and have written other songs, such as [...] "Old Yellow Bricks", from the Arctic Monkey's second album Favourite Worst Nightmare and also [...] "The Machine", which appears on Reverend and the Makers' album The State of Things. [...] "He Said He Loved Me", like the debut single [...] "Heavyweight Champion of the World" [...] is also attributed to <b>Alan</b> <b>Smyth</b> who produced the original demos for the band. The B-sides, [...] "You Get So Alone Sometimes It Just Makes Sense" [...] and [...] "God is in the TV" [...] are both co-written by Ed Cosens.|$|R
5000|$|... "Heavyweight Champion Of The World" [...] tells a {{story of}} not just under-achievers, but the {{majority}} who are trapped within repetitive lives, with the ironic hook [...] "just be like everybody else". Many songs by the band centre on the downward spiral of somebody's life. The song title is taken from a line of Barry Hines book 'A Kestrel For A Knave.' Like the song, the book's main character is an under-achieving young boy growing up in Yorkshire. The song has received rave reviews, and appeared as Zane Lowe's 'Hottest Record In The World Today', and is equally liked by Radio 1 DJs Nick Grimshaw and Greg James. The single is accredited to Jon McClure, Ed Cosens and <b>Alan</b> <b>Smyth,</b> acknowledging the work that Smyth did towards the demo of the song.|$|R
5000|$|In summer 2008, Standard Fare {{were signed}} to Thee SPC, an {{independent}} Sheffield label. A recording session followed and March 2009 saw the band's first release, a split single on 7” vinyl with Sheffield band Slow Down Tallahassee, featuring the song [...] "Dancing". A second 7” single, [...] "Fifteen" [...] {{was released on}} Thee SPC in January 2010. An agreement was signed with the Manchester based label, Melodic to co-release the band’s debut album The Noyelle Beat. [...] The album was released in both the UK and US in March 2010, [...] with the US release under Bar None Records. This {{was followed by a}} 7” release of ‘Philadelphia’. The Noyelle Beat featured songs recorded at Stockport’s LP Studios, and at 2Fly Studios in Sheffield with <b>Alan</b> <b>Smyth.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Lodger {{formed in}} 2004, after Leeds label Dance to the Radio offered {{to put out}} a single on the basis of demos that Ben Siddall {{recorded}} in his bedsit, the band name inspired by his accommodation. The initial line-up was Siddall on guitar and vocals with Lisa Harker on bass and Katie James on drums. After 3 sold-out limited 7"s ("Many Thanks For Your Honest Opinion" [...] on Dance to the Radio, [...] "Watching" [...] on Double Dragon, and [...] "Let Her Go" [...] on Angular Records) and touring around the UK and Europe with bands such as The Long Blondes and The Research, the group released their debut album Grown-Ups, produced by <b>Alan</b> <b>Smyth</b> and James Ford, in June 2007 on Angular Records in the UK, Slumberland Records in the US, Fabtone in Japan and Speak N Spell in Australia. By this time Harker and James had left the band, to be replaced by Joe Margetts and Bruce Renshaw.|$|R
2500|$|Reverend and The Makers {{released}} a 9-track demo in 2006, entitled [...] "Ten Songs". The artwork included a track list with ten songs, track 10 being [...] "Paris at Night". However this song {{was not made}} available for download; it only surfaced on the internet in August 2007. The demos were recorded at 2Fly Studios, and produced by <b>Alan</b> <b>Smyth,</b> McClure acknowledges the work Smyth put into the demos by accrediting the debut single; [...] "Heavyweight Champion of The World" [...] as McClure/Cosens/Smyth. Reverend and the Makers' music {{is a mix of}} indie guitar pop, electronica and a touch of Madchester-esque funk. Some of the internet demos feature members of other notable Sheffield musicians such as Alex Turner (Arctic Monkeys), Tim Hampton (Bromheads Jacket) and Mike Hughes (Little Ze). One of Reverend's inspirations is Manchester performance poet John Cooper Clarke and Reverend often performs his own poems, of a similar style, in between songs during his live sets. One of the B-sides to the debut single [...] "Heavyweight Champion of the World" [...] is a poem entitled [...] "Last Resort" [...] in which John Cooper Clarke and McClure read alternate stanzas. This poem was also duetted live when the band played live at Shoreditch's Spread Eagle in the first tour in May 2006.|$|R
5000|$|Also in {{the summer}} of 2003, Turner played seven gigs in York and Liverpool as a rhythm guitarist for the funk band Judan Suki, after meeting the lead singer Jon McClure on a bus. The {{experience}} made him [...] "more confident. Jon is a very confident character." [...] In August 2003, Turner recorded a demo with Judan Suki at Sheffield's 2fly Studios and asked <b>Alan</b> <b>Smyth</b> if he would produce his other band. Smyth obliged: “They were giddy. They weren’t the tightest of bands {{by any stretch of the}} imagination, but I thought they definitely had something special going on. I told Alex off for singing in an American voice at that first session.” Smyth introduced the band to Geoff Barradale, with whom he had once played in a band called Seafruit. Barradale became their manager after their third gig (at The Boardwalk) and paid for them to record four more three-song demos from late August 2003 to November 2004. Barradale drove the band around venues in the north of England to establish their reputation, handing out copies of the demo CDs after each show. Fans began sharing the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk demo compilation online and, by the end of 2004, audiences knew the words to the songs.|$|R
5000|$|The fold was {{short-lived}} however. Steve Mackey, {{a regular at}} their Sheffield and London gigs, was also studying in London and was asked to join the band as a bass player. The line-up now consisted of Cocker, Mackey, Senior, Candida Doyle, Nick Banks (drums). In mid-1989, they began recording another album for Fire, {{this time with a}} bigger budget and production from <b>Alan</b> <b>Smyth,</b> called Separations. This was a progression of the style of Freaks, with Leonard Cohen-esque ballads on side one and an acid house infused track-listing on side two. The disparate styles can be attributed to Cocker and Mackey's different and changing tastes; Mackey introduced Cocker to house music which led to them both going to raves, while Cocker introduced Mackey to [...] "Scott Walker and Serge Gainsbourg". Like Freaks, the release of Separations was delayed, to an extent lessening the potential impact. In the meantime, however, in 1991, a 12" [...] recording, [...] "My Legendary Girlfriend", became music periodical NMEs single of the week. Stuart Maconie described it in his review as [...] "a throbbing ferment of nightclub soul and teen opera". Furthermore, [...] "Countdown" [...] began to be mentioned in the mainstream press, heralding a turning point in Pulp's quest for fame.|$|R
5000|$|Reverend and The Makers {{released}} a 9-track demo in 2006, entitled [...] "Ten Songs". The artwork included a track list with ten songs, track 10 being [...] "Paris at Night".

50|$|In an <b>alternate</b> 1995, <b>Alan</b> and Sarah {{are married}} and expecting their first child. Alan's parents {{are still alive}} and {{successfully}} running the family business. He and Sarah meet Judy, Peter, and their parents Jim and Martha {{for the first time}} during a Christmas party. Alan offers Jim a job and convinces them to cancel their upcoming ski trip, averting their deaths.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Steven {{recalled}} {{the process as}} follows: [...] "As we started bashing out new songs we knew that something wasn’t quite right - {{there was a feeling}} of unresolve. We had 'a lost album' and it suddenly hit us all. Could we simply ignore the wealth of music and love we had created with Sir Tim? No… It felt strange at first. These were songs we had heard over and over a few years before and we were playing them all again. But instead of a turgid process of replication we found ourselves reigniting the flame we had then adding more and more to it." [...] The Morricones reworked and rewrote the songs as new versions, then recorded them in new sessions at 2fly Studios in Sheffield produced by <b>Alan</b> <b>Smyth</b> (Pulp, Arctic Monkeys, Richard Hawley and others). Cursed was also the most expansively-arranged Scaramanga Six album for many years, with the Morricone brothers’ saxophones bolstered by trumpet and trombone (recorded at the original Smith sessions), live strings, and additional keyboards played by former member Chris Catalyst. New York singer-songwriter and instrument inventor Thomas Truax also made a guest appearance, playing three of his own instruments - the Hornicator, the String-a-Ling and the mysterious Dracula’s Eyeball. Apart from the brass tracks, the only recording retained from the Smith sessions was [...] "Walking Through Houses" [...] which the Morricones decided [...] "had to stay as it was".|$|R
5000|$|As Director of Photography, he filmed mostly light-hearted comedies. He {{made several}} for {{producer}} Betty Box, including the Doctor films, {{based on the}} books by Richard Gordon, A Tale of Two Cities (1958) and The 39 Steps (1959). He was cinematographer for the Carry On comedy series, beginning with Carry On Sergeant in 1958, eventually <b>alternating</b> with <b>Alan</b> Hume as regular DoP. Between 1950 and 1971 he was the cinematographer on practically all the films directed by Ralph Thomas, a total of 32 productions.|$|R
5000|$|Between 2008 and 2010, Morrison {{presented}} the Drivetime afternoon shift where he consistently held 2nd {{place in the}} market but never broke to number one.

Morrison told the Sydney Morning Herald at the time [...] "it was luck and anyone who thinks otherwise is kidding themselves". Jones later remarked [...] "I'm not surprised, Jason is hugely talented and one day I won't be here so it's in good hands".|$|R

2500|$|In [...] 2, an <b>alternate</b> {{version of}} <b>Alan</b> Scott is featured. This Alan Scott's ring's origin is {{explained}} as having originally been a Green Lantern ring that was lost on Earth long ago. In this storyline, {{the first time}} Alan used his ring, he was knocked out from behind by {{a man with a}} wooden club. This caused Alan to believe the ring was weak against wood, thereby causing a mental block that prevented him from truly exerting his power against wooden objects or attacks. (This was confirmed by the Guardians, who explained that this was the reason behind the weakness to yellow of the Green Lantern Corps' rings. They simply told all new Green Lanterns that their rings were powerless against yellow to establish the same mental block.) ...|$|R
5000|$|On June 1, 2012, DC Comics {{announced}} that it would be introducing an <b>alternate</b> version of <b>Alan</b> Scott as a gay man in the title [...] "Earth 2." [...] The New 52 issue was released on June 6, 2012. In its story, an Alan Scott and his partner Sam were both passengers aboard a train, but the latter was killed when their train was wrecked in the railroad-bridge collapse that Scott alone survived, a magical green flame found Alan amongst the rubble. Telling him he is to become an avatar of the flame's great power, and that he must channel this power through an item of importance to his heart, Alan chooses the engagement ring he was to give his boyfriend, becoming the Green Lantern. This alternate version is {{not a member of the}} Green Lantern Corps, which doesn't exist in Earth 2, but rather adopts the name Green Lantern for himself, for his powers derives his mystical powers from the Green, the elemental force which connects plant life on Earth.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} differentially expressed genes relevant to orbital inflammation and orbital fat expansion in thyroid orbitopathy (TO) using microarray gene profiling in a case-control study. Methods: Human orbital adipose samples {{were obtained from}} individuals with active TO (n = 12), inactive TO (n = 21), and normal controls (n = 21). Gene expression profiles were examined using microarray analysis and were compared between active and inactive TO, and between active TO and normal controls. Top ranked differentially expressed genes were validated by real-time RT-PCR in an additional eight active TO, 13 inactive TO, and 11 normal controls and correlated with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and molecular pathways analysis. Results: Seven hundred twenty-one probes (683 genes) and 806 probes (735 genes) were significantly differentially expressed in comparing active to inactive TO and in comparing active TO to healthy controls, respectively. All selected genes were confirmed to be differentially expressed by real-time RT-PCR. Multiple top ranked genes in active versus inactive TO comparison are overrepresented by immune and inflammatory response genes. They include defensins (DEFA 1, DEFA 1 B, DEFA 3), which were overexpressed by 3. 05 - to 4. 14 -fold and TIMD 4 by 4. 20 -fold. Markers for adipogenesis were overexpressed including SCD, FADS 1, and SCDP 1. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed dysregulation of epigenetic signatures, T-cell activation, Th 1 differentiation, defensin pathway, cell adhesion, cytoskeleton organization, apoptosis, cell cycling, and lipid metabolism in active TO. Conclusions: Active TO is characterized by upregulation of genes involved in cell-mediated immune, innate immune, and inflammatory response and enhanced orbital adipogenesis. TIMD 4, DEFA 1, DEFA 1 B, and DEFA 3 genes {{may be involved in}} the innate immune-mediated orbital inflammation in TO. Epigenetic mechanisms {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of TO.
