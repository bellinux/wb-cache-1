But non-uniform blending or dispersion of complex resulted in phase separation, decomposition and inefficient energy transfer to reduce emission efficiency. The complexes were covalently attached to the main chain of polymers, which improved film quality and solubility. Eu(TTA) 2 (AA) phen as europium complex monomer (ECM) was prepared by Eu 3 + coordinating with 1, 10 -phenanthroline (phen), acrylic acid (AA) and 2 -thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA). Fluorescent polymer marked as p 1 - 30 (molar ratio for ECM/N-vinylcarbazole (NVK), 1 / 30) was synthesized. The emissions of ECM and p 1 - 30 in the films peaked at ca. 610 nm.

40|$|Imaging of {{molecular}} trafficking in cells and biological tissue aided by molecular-specific fluorescent labeling is very attractive, since it affords capturing the key processes in comprehensive biological context. Several {{shortcomings of the}} existing organic dye labeling technology, however, call for development of <b>alternative</b> <b>molecular</b> reporters, with improved photostability, reduced cytotoxicity, and an increased number of controllable surface moieties. Such <b>alternative</b> <b>molecular</b> reporters are represented by inorganic luminescent nanoparticles (NP) whose optical, physical, and chemical properties are discussed on the examples of luminescent nanodiamonds (LND) and upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP). The emission origins of these nanomaterials differ markedly. LND emission results from individual nitrogen-vacancy color-centers in a biocompatible nanodiamond host whose properties can be controlled via size and surface groups. Photophysics of UCNP is governed by the collective, nonlinear excitation transfer processes, resulting in conversion of longer-wavelength excitation to the shorter-wavelength emission. The emission/excitation spectral properties of UCNP falling within the biological tissue transparency window open new opportunities of almost complete suppression of the cell/tissue autofluorescence background. The developed surface of these nanoparticles represents a flexible platform populated with biocompatible surface moieties onto which cargo and targeting biomolecules can be firmly docked through a process called bioconjugation. These bioconjugated modules, e. g., nanodiamond-antibody, (quantum dot) -somatostatin, or (upconversion nanoparticle) -(mini-antibody) can gain admission into the cells by initiating the cell-specific, cell-recognized communication protocol.
