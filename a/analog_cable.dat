25|$|HBO {{has long}} {{maintained}} a policy {{not to run}} R-rated films on its primary channel between 6:00a.m. and 8:00p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time; this policy (which may have once stemmed from HBO's availability on <b>analog</b> <b>cable</b> tiers, while its multiplex channels generally required a digital cable subscription or at least scrambling) remains in place , despite {{the existence of the}} V-chip and other premium services having incorporated R-rated films onto their daytime schedules starting in the mid-1980s. The policy was also applied to all TV-MA rated programs after the TV Parental Guidelines were implemented on January 1, 1997; however the main HBO channel began airing a limited amount of TV-MA rated original series, movies and documentaries that contain some strong profanity and violence, but are largely devoid of nudity, and graphic violent or sexual content on weekends before 8:00p.m. Eastern in 2010. However, HBO does occasionally rebroadcast R-rated films as early as 6:00p.m. Eastern Time as part of its Sunday rebroadcast of the prior Saturday's movie premiere telecast, depending on the length of the film and the scheduling of any HBO original series that air after it.|$|E

2500|$|On February 1, 2009 during Super Bowl XLIII, Comcast's {{transmission}} of NBC affiliate KVOA (channel 4) in Tucson, Arizona was interrupted for approximately 20 seconds replacing the telecast {{of the game}} via NBC (which was not owned by Comcast at the time) with soft-core porn from the adult pay-per-view channel Shorteez. This accidental display affected Comcast's <b>analog</b> <b>cable</b> subscribers {{in parts of the}} Tucson area. The substitution appears to have been made at Comcast, not at KVOA, leaving KVOA's over-the-air, satellite and other cable providers viewers unaffected. Also, Comcast's high-definition {{transmission of}} KVOA was not affected. Comcast launched an investigation on the incident with the FBI stating that it was an [...] "isolated, malicious act". Comcast also offered to give a $10 credit to any customers who say they viewed the approximately 30-second clip. In October 2011, Frank Tanori Gonzalez, a former Cox Communications employee, admitted that he was responsible for the porn clip. He was ordered to serve three years probation and pay $1,000 in damages.|$|E

50|$|Digital audio {{provides}} {{several advantages}} over traditional analog audio distribution. Audio transmitted over <b>analog</b> <b>cables</b> can be {{adversely affected by}} signal degradation due to electromagnetic interference, high-frequency attenuation, and voltage drop over long cable runs. Thanks to digital multiplexing, the cabling requirements for digital audio distribution are almost always reduced when compared to analog audio. Dante also provides specific advantages over first-generation audio over Ethernet technologies, such as CobraNet and EtherSound. Technological advancements include native gigabit support, higher channel count, lower latency, and automatic configuration.|$|R

This work will also focus on a totally new parallel kine-matics possessing 5 degrees of freedom called Alpha 5. It has the exceptional ability to achieve rotations of ± 90 ◦ in amplitude on both, the A and B axis. The present kine-matics shows an important complexity in its mechanics and is therefore a more difficult structure to control.

The first set of memories shows Topher's introduction to the Dollhouse with DeWitt and Dominic, and his creation of a new imprinting system that used a different approach to the technology, leading {{to the development of the}} chair found in this episode. The old technology used <b>analog</b> <b>cables,</b> which took two hours to upload into an active.
