5|$|Between 2008 and 2016, IUCN Red List {{assessors}} for lions {{used only}} two subspecific names, P. l. leo for African lion populations and P. l. persica for the <b>Asiatic</b> <b>lion</b> population.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{morphology}} of 58 lion skulls {{in three}} European museums, the subspecies krugeri, nubica, persica, and senegalensis were assessed distinct; but bleyenberghi overlapped with senegalensis and krugeri. The <b>Asiatic</b> <b>lion</b> persica {{was the most}} distinctive, and the Cape lion had characteristics allying it more with P. l. persica than the other sub-Saharan lions.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the decline of lion population in Africa, several coordinated efforts involving lion conservation have been organised in an attempt to stem this decline. Lions are one species included in the Species Survival Plan, a coordinated attempt by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to increase its chances of survival. The plan was originally started in 1982 for the <b>Asiatic</b> <b>lion,</b> but was suspended when it was found that most Asiatic lions in North American zoos were not genetically pure, having been hybridised with African lions. The African lion plan started in 1993, focusing especially on the South African subspecies, although there are difficulties in assessing the genetic diversity of captive lions, since most individuals are of unknown origin, making maintenance of genetic diversity a problem.|$|E
5|$|Many Indian species {{descend from}} taxa {{originating}} in Gondwana, {{from which the}} Indian plate separated more than 105 million years before present. Peninsular India's subsequent movement towards and collision with the Laurasian landmass set off a mass exchange of species. Epochal volcanism and climatic changes 20 million years ago forced a mass extinction. Mammals then entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the rising Himalaya. Thus, while 45.8% of reptiles and 55.8% of amphibians are endemic, only 12.6% of mammals and 4.5% of birds are. Among them are the Nilgiri leaf monkey and Beddome's toad of the Western Ghats. India contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms. These include the <b>Asiatic</b> <b>lion,</b> the Bengal tiger, the snow leopard and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which, by ingesting the carrion of diclofenac-laced cattle, nearly became extinct.|$|E
5|$|While the subspecific {{status of}} the <b>Asiatic</b> <b>lion</b> (P. l. persica) is {{generally}} accepted, the systematic relationships among African lions are still not completely resolved. Mitochondrial variation in living African lions seemed to be modest according to some newer studies; therefore, all sub-Saharan lions have sometimes been considered a single subspecies. However, a recent study revealed that lions from western and central Africa differ genetically from lions of southern or eastern Africa. According to this study, West-Central African lions are {{more closely related to}} North African and Asian lions than to Southern or East African lions. These findings might be explained by a late Pleistocene extinction event of lions in western and central Africa, and a subsequent recolonisation of these parts from Asia.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, three European zoos {{imported}} pure <b>Asiatic</b> <b>lions</b> from India: the London Zoo obtained two pairs; the Zürich Zoologischer Garten one pair; and the Helsinki Zoo one male and two females. In 1994, the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) for <b>Asiatic</b> <b>lions</b> was initiated. The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) published the first European Studbook in 1999. By 2005, there were 80 <b>Asiatic</b> <b>lions</b> {{kept in the}} EEP — the only captive population outside of India.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Asiatic</b> <b>lion</b> is {{a common}} motif in Chinese art. They were first used in art during the late Spring and Autumn period (fifth or sixth century BC), and became much more popular during the Han Dynasty (206 BC – AD 220), when {{imperial}} guardian lions started {{to be placed in}} front of imperial palaces for protection. Because lions have never been native to China, early depictions were somewhat unrealistic; after the introduction of Buddhist art to China in the Tang Dynasty (after the sixth century AD), lions usually were wingless, with shorter, thicker bodies, and curly manes. The lion dance is a form of traditional dance in Chinese culture in which performers mimic a lion's movements in a lion costume, often with musical accompaniment from cymbals, drums, and gongs. They are performed at Chinese New Year, the August Moon Festival and other celebratory occasions for good luck.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Asiatic</b> <b>Lion</b> Reintroduction Project is an {{initiative}} of the Indian Government to provide safeguards to the <b>Asiatic</b> <b>lion</b> (Panthera leo persica) from extinction in the wild by means of reintroduction. The last wild population of the <b>Asiatic</b> <b>lion</b> {{is found in the}} Gir Forest region of the state of Gujarat. The single population faces the threats of epidemics, natural disasters and other anthropogenic factors. The project aims to establish a second independent population of Asiatic lions at the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. However, the proposed translocation is unpopular in Gujarat and has been bitterly contested by the state government.|$|E

25|$|The 14th <b>Asiatic</b> <b>Lion</b> Census 2015 was {{conducted}} in May 2015. In 2015, the population has been 523 (27% up compared to previous census in 2010). The population was 411 in 2010 and 359 in 2005. The population of lions in Junagadh District has been 268, Gir Somnath District has been 44, Amreli District has been 174 (highest increase) and Bhavangar District has been 37. There are 109 males, 201 females and 213 young/cubs.|$|E
25|$|The species {{frequently}} scavenges {{from the}} kills of felids such as tigers, leopards, cheetahs and caracals. A caracal can drive a subadult hyena from a carcass. The hyena usually wins in one-to-one disputes over carcasses with leopards, cheetahs and tiger cubs, but {{is dominated by}} adult tigers. In addition, the hyena is sympatric with the <b>Asiatic</b> <b>lion</b> in Gir Forest National Park, and the sloth bear in Balaram Ambaji Wildlife Sanctuary, in the Indian State of Gujarat.|$|E
25|$|The Lion Breeding Programme creates and {{maintains}} breeding centres.

At the time, many of the animals Vernay was seeking, such as the Sumatran rhinoceros and <b>Asiatic</b> <b>lion,</b> were already rare and facing the possibility of extinction. To acquire these specimens, Vernay {{would have to make}} many appeals to regional authorities in order to obtain hunting permits. The relations he would forge during this time would assist later museum related expeditions headed by Vernay in gaining access to areas previously restricted to foreign visitors.|$|E
25|$|The Central Zoo Authority of India (CZA) has {{identified}} the park as coordinating zoo for the breeding programmes for endangered species as per the National Zoo Policy {{adopted by the}} Government of India in 1988, which states that the main objective of zoos will be to complement and strengthen national efforts in the conservation of the country's rich biodiversity and that the species which have no chance of survival in the wild would be bred under ex-situ conditions. The park has {{a high rate of}} success in captive breeding of lion-tailed macaques. In 2010, the zoo had 22 lion-tailed macaques, from a breeding pair that were brought to the zoo in 1983. The park is also successful in breeding other rare species in captivity, including ostrich, Asian palm civet, Indian gaur, wild dog, <b>Asiatic</b> <b>lion,</b> Nilgiri langur, sangai, hippo, Malabar giant squirrel, white tiger, Asiatic wolf, panther and bison. The zoo is among four in the country to have an ostrich. The park also undertakes cross-breeding as part of its conservation efforts. The park is also a participating zoo of the CZA for the captive breeding of rock python, Nilgiri langur, lion-tailed macaque, <b>Asiatic</b> <b>lion,</b> wild dog, Asiatic wolf, and gaur. The zoo also promotes exterior conservation—conservation of rare species in their natural habitat—whereby individuals born in the zoo are released in the wild after adequate training, as per the guidelines of the CZA.|$|E
25|$|Clashes between tigers and lions {{have been}} reported, before humans extirpated lions or tigers {{in a number}} of places. Currently, the <b>Asiatic</b> <b>lion</b> is found in Kathiawar Peninsula, Gujarat, and the closest Bengal tiger {{population}} is at the border triangle of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. In particular, the Dangs' Forest in southeastern Gujarat, where Purna Wildlife Sanctuary and Vansda National Park are located, is a potential tiger habitat. Apart from that, the lion habitat in the Gir Forest is in the same ecoregion as Ranthambore and Sariska National Parks: the Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests. In pre-accession times, the Maharaja of Gwalior introduced African lions into this area, which is tiger habitat.|$|E
