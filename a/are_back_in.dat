He leaves with an offer to bankroll a new restaurant. In a flash-forward set six months later, the new restaurant is successful and closed for a private event: Carl and Inez's remarriage ceremony.|$|E

25|$|Greater issues {{arose in}} the 1990’s, when supermodel Kate Moss popularized the stick-thin figure instead. The fashion {{industry}} pushed her image further with the ‘heroin-chic’ look, which dominated the catwalks during that time. This was communicated through waifish appearances, bony structures, thin limbs, and an androgynous figure. Although this extreme period was only short-lived, the 2000’s saw {{the rise of the}} Victoria’s Secret models, who altered beauty norms to include slim but healthy figures, with large breasts and bottoms, flat and visible abs, and prominent thigh gaps. Hence, women started pursuing cosmetic surgery practices; on top of diets and exercise regimes, to attain the perfect appearance. Nevertheless, curves <b>are</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> season and positive measures are now being taken to promote a better body image. The emergence of fitness trends, plus-size models, and other better role models in the fashion and media industries are other factors at work too. Contrariwise, the advancement of technologies, and the pressures from the media, has unfortunately triggered an even greater societal importance on the way we look as an indication of our personal value.|$|E
25|$|Artemis is {{described}} as having pale skin, deep blue eyes, premature wrinkling near the eyes, and raven black hair. He is said to resemble his father. As of his adventures in The Lost Colony, Artemis has exchanged one eye with Holly Short {{as a result of}} a botched re-materialization and now possesses one blue eye and one hazel eye, and a time travel in The Time Paradox aged him to his chronological age of 18 but then back again upon his return to his own time. A similar re-materialization resulted in the swapping of the index and second fingers on his left hand. His smile is called vampire-like, and he maintains manicured hands. Artemis has a slight build and is not physically fit. He often wears Armani suits. It is also mentioned by himself that his first suit was a Zegna custom made as worn by Holly in The Time Paradox. As of , Artemis has reverted to his image as it was at the start of the series due to being placed in a new body grown by Foaly when he lost his during Opal's attempt to dominate the world and wipe out the human race. He now possesses two blue eyes and all fingers <b>are</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> their original place. It is noted, however, that Artemis has the physical appearance of a boy just over the age of 15 and now also has six toes on one foot.|$|E

500|$|Thin Lizzy are a {{hard rock}} band formed in Dublin, Ireland in 1969. Two of the {{founding}} members, drummer Brian Downey and bass guitarist and lead vocalist Phil Lynott, met while still in school. Lynott led the group throughout their recording career of twelve studio albums, writing most of the material. The singles [...] "Whiskey in the Jar" [...] (a traditional Irish ballad), [...] "Jailbreak", and [...] "The Boys <b>Are</b> <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> Town" [...] were [...] major international hits. After Lynott's death in 1986, various incarnations of the band emerged over the years based initially around guitarists Scott Gorham and John Sykes, though Sykes left the band in 2009. Gorham later continued with a new line-up including Downey.|$|E
500|$|Late in development, Jaleco {{commissioned}} Realtime Associates {{to provide}} background music, which no previous version of Maniac Mansion had featured. Realtime Associates' {{founder and president}} David Warhol noted that [...] "video games at that time had to have 'wall to wall' music". He brought in George [...] "The Fat Man" [...] Sanger and his band, along with David Hayes, to compose the score. Their goal was to create songs that suited each character, such as a punk rock theme for Razor, an electronic rock theme for Bernard and a version of Thin Lizzy's [...] "The Boys <b>Are</b> <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> Town" [...] for Dave Miller. Warhol translated their work into NES chiptune music.|$|E

500|$|On the island, the {{remaining}} survivors <b>are</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the past, attempting {{to start a}} fire, when they are attacked by a barrage of flaming arrows. Some of the survivors are able to escape, but Neil [...] "Frogurt" [...] {{and a few others}} are killed, and James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) are separated from the group. Lost in the jungle, they are captured by a group of armed military men who demand to know who they are, asserting that the island is theirs. The men are about to cut off Juliet's hand to extract information, when John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) ambushes them, helping Sawyer and Juliet free themselves.|$|E
500|$|On this album, {{the band}} segues {{immediately}} from [...] "Cowboy Song" [...] into [...] "The Boys <b>Are</b> <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> Town", {{on the line}} [...] "a cowboy's life is the life for me" [...] – the last chord of the former {{was the first of}} the latter, although their studio versions were recorded as separate songs. This segue between the two tracks remained a staple of the band's setlist for the rest of their career, and examples can be found on other live releases. The band had rearranged [...] "Still in Love with You" [...] to be slower and more emotional than the original studio version, and the version recorded on Live and Dangerous was considered by Putterford to be the highlight of Lynott's musical career.|$|E

500|$|After a {{successful}} multi-band tour {{in support of}} Status Quo, the band recorded the album Jailbreak, which proved to be their breakthrough record. Released on 26 March 1976, it featured the worldwide hit [...] "The Boys <b>Are</b> <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> Town" [...] which reached no. 8 in the UK, and no. 12 in the US, their first charting record in that country. The twin guitar sound had been fully developed by this time and was in evidence throughout the album, particularly on the hit single, and other tracks such as [...] "Emerald" [...] and [...] "Warriors". The album also charted well {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, and the follow-up single, [...] "Jailbreak", also performed well. Thin Lizzy toured the US in support of various bands such as Aerosmith, Rush and REO Speedwagon, and they planned to tour there again in June 1976, this time with Rainbow. However, Lynott fell ill with hepatitis and the tour was cancelled, which set them back a few months.|$|E
500|$|The {{remaining}} members of Thin Lizzy {{did not work}} together until the recording of the single [...] "Dedication" [...] in October 1990, when a rough demo of Lynott's called [...] "Guiding Light" [...] was worked into a finished song to commemorate {{the fifth anniversary of}} his death. The song dated from the Grand Slam days and had been originally written with guitarist Laurence Archer. Modern recording techniques were used to replace the guitar and drum tracks with new work by Downey and Gorham. Gary Moore had agreed to participate as well, but ultimately did not do so. The song charted in the UK at no. 35 during early 1991, and no. 2 in Ireland, and featured on another greatest hits compilation album, , released in February of that year, which reached no. 8 in the UK album chart. [...] However, a follow-up reissue of [...] "The Boys <b>Are</b> <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> Town" [...] only reached no. 63 in the UK, although it peaked at no. 16 in Ireland.|$|E
500|$|Overdrive {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics; Metacritic, a review aggregator website, gave the album an average score of 67 out of 100 from 17 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favourable reviews". NME awarded the album 7 out of 10 stars, with reviewer Stuart Huggett {{arguing that the}} album contained [...] "personal and political lyrics far smarter than Shonen Knife’s cartoon image suggests." [...] Zachary Houle of Pop Matters awarded the album six out of ten stars, and mused that Shonen Knife's fusing of punk and classic rock on the album [...] "somehow work". Houle, however, was critical of the band's penchant for bordering closely on copying other artists' music; he argued that [...] "Bad Luck Song" [...] and [...] "Black Crow" [...] are strikingly similar to Thin Lizzy's [...] "The Boys <b>Are</b> <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> Town" [...] and Kiss's [...] "Black Diamond", respectively, but felt that [...] "the album gets better as it goes along".|$|E
