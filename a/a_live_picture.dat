50|$|Document cameras, {{also known}} as visual presenters, visualisers (in the United Kingdom), digital overheads, or docucams, are {{real-time}} image capture devices for displaying an object to a large audience. Like an opaque projector, a document camera is able to magnify and project the images of actual, three-dimensional objects, as well as transparencies. They are, in essence, high resolution web cams, mounted on arms so as to facilitate their placement over a page. This allows a teacher, lecturer or presenter to write {{on a sheet of}} paper or to display a two or three-dimensional object while the audience watches. Theoretically, all objects can be displayed by a document camera. Most objects are simply placed under the camera. The camera takes the picture which in turn produces <b>a</b> <b>live</b> <b>picture</b> using a projector or monitor. Different types of document camera/visualizer allow great flexibility in terms of placement of objects. Larger objects, for example, can simply be placed {{in front of the camera}} and the camera rotated as necessary,or a ceiling mounted document camera can also be used to allow a larger working area to be used.|$|E

By processing a queue of user requests at different pan/tilt/zoom locations, the server can capture a single photograph for each user. While one user downloads a new live image, the robotic camera moves to capture images and service other independent user requests. The end-toend system enables each user to independently steer the robotic camera, viewing live snapshot pictures from a cellular phone...|$|E
40|$|Exile and Globalization are two postcolonial {{terms that}} reflect {{the reality of the}} {{communities}} and the influence of such terms on {{the lives of the people}} inside or outside their communities. Exile and globalization have gained special concern in the poetry of Abdullah Al Baraduni, a Yemeni poet. The article traces the influence of such terms upon the lives of Yemenis through two selected poems of Al Baraduni. Both terms would lead one of them to the other; in exile, the person would be distanced from his culture, language, tradition, religion and separated from his community, as a result, the person will be permeated by the global cultures that do not recognize any cultural or social restrictions on the other aspects of lives. Al Baraduni reflects <b>a</b> <b>live</b> <b>picture</b> of the Yemeni community in particular and the Arab community in general and how the person feels exiled in his/her country. Globalization makes the international communities get smaller and establishes many crossroads in their daily lives. Through these two postcolonial terms and through two poems of Al Baraduni, the article addresses these two concepts in Al Baraduni's poetry and how he depicts their influence upon the community in very attractive image, using brilliantly metaphorical images and interesting expressions that make exile and globalization as unavoidable terms in the lives of Arab people. Al Baraduni explicates the influence of exile and globalization upon the Yemeni lives in particular and the Arab world in general. It is inescapable influence reflected in all aspects of daily lives...|$|E

Before authors begin filming this, the authors conducted several research methods, such as literature, namely by looking for books related to the movie-making process. Moreover, the authors also conducted an analysis of some of the films made in reference to the character creation as well as analyzing the properties commonly used in a comedy movie. Film "AGUS" tells about the life of a young person who wanted to try his fortune village in the city. Are then faced with a dilemma, in which he must decide wisely over what happened. The process of making this film started pre-production process that begins with the design work of ideas and concepts. Writers develop it into a movie by using the techniques of filmmaking in general. This film uses a video editing software on finalizing, it will also facilitate the task of the writer in perfecting.

40|$|Two related {{bodies of}} work are presented, {{both of which}} aim to further the rapid {{development}} of next generation concentrating photovoltaic systems using high efficiency multi junction solar cells. They are complementary since the characterization of commercial devices and the systematic application of design principles for future designs must progress in parallel in order to accelerate iterative improvements. First addressed, is the field characterization of {{state of the art}} concentrating photovoltaic systems. Performance modeling and root cause analysis of deviations from the modeling results are critical for bringing reliable high value products to the market. Two complementary tools are presented that facilitate acceleration of the development cycle. The âDynamic real-time I V Curve Measurement Systemâ¦â provides <b>a</b> <b>live</b> <b>picture</b> of the current-voltage characteristics of a CPV module. This provides the user with an intuitive understanding of how module performance responds under perturbation. The âShutter technique for noninvasive individual cell characterization in sealed concentrating photovoltaic modules,â allows the user to probe individual cell characteristics within a sealed module. This facilitates non-invasive characterization of modules that are in situ. Together, these tools were used to diagnose the wide spread failure of epoxy connections between the carrier and the emitter of bypass diodes installed in sealed commercial modules. Next, the optimization principals that are used to choose energy yield maximizing bandgap combinations for multi-junction solar cells are investigated. It is well understood that, due to differences in the solar resource in different geographical locations, this is fundamentally a local optimization problem. However, until now, a robust methodology for determining the influences of geography and atmospheric content on the ideal design point has not been developed. This analysis is presented and the influence of changing environment on the representative spectra that are used to optimize bandgap combinations is demonstrated. Calculations are confirmed with ground measurements in Ottawa, Canada and the global trends are refined for this particular location. Further, as cell designers begin to take advantage of more flexible manufacturing processes, it is critical to know if and how optimization criteria must change for solar cells with more junctions. This analysis is expanded to account for the differences between cells with up to 8 subcell bandgaps. A number of software tools were also developed for the Sunlab during this work. A multi-junction solar cell model calibration tool was developed to determine the parameters that describe each subcell. The tool fits a two diode model to temperature dependent measurements of each subcell and provides the fitting parameters so that the performance of multi-junction solar cells composed of those subcells can be modeled for real world conditions before they are put on-sun. A multi-junction bandgap optimization tool was developed to more quickly and robustly determine the ideal bandgap combinations for a set of input spectra. The optimization process outputs the current results during iteration so that they may be visualized. Finally, software tools that compute annual energy yield for input multi-junction cell parameters were developed. Both a brute force tool that computes energy harvested at each time step, and an accelerated tool that first bins time steps into discrete bins were developed. These tools will continue to be used by members of the Sunlab...|$|E

40|$|To {{explore the}} {{question}} whether a promising concept that supports a UAV operator in separating the UAV from other traffic, also has potential benefits for Air Traffic Control, an identification and analysis of possibilities to add the conflict probing function to an existing Air Traffic Control system, the Multi-Aegis Site Emulator, was performed. The surveillance sensor type was a decisive aspect in this conversion, due to stringent requirements on position and velocity accuracy for effective conflict probing. Based on the results it was concluded that, within certain constraints, the envisioned implementation was technically feasible.
