60|$|Louise glanced <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> {{sat up in}} bed, {{and turned}} reproachfully toward Aline.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Claire did not speak. Then she looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> and got up.|$|E
60|$|Violet glanced <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> with {{an exclamation}} of dismayed annoyance. She leaned appealingly towards the croupier.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked across}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> thoughtfully, <b>watching</b> <b>her</b> face, {{curious to see}} whether his words might have any effect.|$|R
60|$|He nodded <b>at</b> <b>her</b> slightly, <b>watching</b> <b>her</b> fixedly, {{turning up}} {{the corners of his}} eyes slyly, his nose seeming slyly to sharpen.|$|R
60|$|Juan. <b>At</b> <b>her</b> lattice, <b>watching</b> for Lord Adelbert, and gazing on {{the flowers}} he hath sent.|$|R
60|$|Joan looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> She had {{an article}} to finish. Madge stood on tiptoe and kissed her.|$|E
60|$|An idea {{suddenly}} darted into Nancy's brain. At {{first she}} looked aghast. Then {{she laughed and}} glanced <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
60|$|No {{one was in}} {{the room}} but Marian. She was reading, and she looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> in surprise, when I came in.|$|E
6000|$|Then she went, {{giving him}} {{her hand as}} she parted from him; and he, {{as she left the}} room looked anxiously <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>watching</b> <b>her</b> countenance and her gait, and {{listening}} to the very fall of her footstep. [...] "Ah," [...] he said to himself; when he was alone, [...] "the young people have the best of it. The sun shines for them; but why should they have all? Poor as he is, he is a happy dog,--a happy dog. But she is twice too good for him. Why did she not take to one of her own country?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... [CHLOE {{starts up}} from the sofa feverishly, looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> [...] <b>watch,</b> <b>at</b> the window, <b>at</b> <b>her</b> watch; then softly crosses to the [...] window and opens it.] ...|$|R
60|$|JAMES [rushing <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{with the}} <b>watch</b> and chain]. Ha'e, Maggie.|$|R
6000|$|Before Miss Churton had {{finished}} welcoming Fan, Miss Starbrow, looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> and directly addressing the elder lady, {{said in a}} cold voice: ...|$|E
60|$|Fleur looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> and rose. His {{mother went}} with her into the house. Jon stayed with his father, puffing at the cigarette.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Gallilee's maid looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> {{when the}} {{carriage}} left Mr. Mool's house. [...] "We shall be {{nearly an hour}} late, before we get home," [...] she said.|$|E
5000|$|Carol- Lotty’s nurse <b>at</b> <b>her</b> clinic. She <b>watches</b> Jill while Vic and Lotty are away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it?" [...] he said, with {{a little}} laugh. [...] "Yes--well, it's not so bad----" [...] he was hesitating. The pale gleam was strong in his eyes, he was looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> steadily, <b>watching</b> <b>her,</b> as an animal might. Something leaped in her soul. She {{knew he was going}} to suggest to her that she should be as he was.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel still sat {{looking up}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face, and <b>watching</b> {{the effect of}} the poison of {{ambition}} which he had artfully instilled into her mind.|$|R
60|$|The {{evening was}} drawing on; {{it was nearly}} half past seven when Helena looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> remembering Louisa, who would be {{waiting for her to}} return to Cornwall.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Milroy {{had just}} looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> {{and had just}} put her hand once more to the bell-pull, {{when the door opened}} and the nurse entered the room.|$|E
60|$|Finding that I {{had nothing}} to say on my side, Mrs. Fosdyke looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> and remembered her {{domestic}} duties. To my relief, our interview came to an end.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hewet {{will be our}} barometer," [...] said Mr. Elliot. [...] "He will melt before I shall." [...] Indeed, if {{so much as a}} drop {{had melted}} off his spare ribs, the bones would have lain bare. The ladies were left alone now, {{surrounding}} The Times which lay upon the floor. Miss Allan looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> father's <b>watch.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{was still}} {{with her when}} the undertakers came, young {{men who had been}} to school with him. They touched her reverently, and in a quiet, businesslike fashion. They did not look <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> He <b>watched</b> jealously. He and Annie guarded her fiercely. They would not let anybody come to see her, and the {{neighbours}} were offended.|$|R
60|$|With {{this purpose}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> heart, she <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> fruit and nursed her flowers; found no task too hard, no sun too hot, no weed too unconquerable; {{and soon the}} garden David planted when his life seemed barren, yielded lovely harvests to swell his little daughter's portion.|$|R
6000|$|... "It wants {{a quarter}} to six at present," [...] said Bathsheba, looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] "I daresay he'll be in directly. Well, now then"--she looked into the book--"Joseph Poorgrass, are you there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A well." [...] Tasso relaxed. [...] "Then we'll find a well." [...] She looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] "We {{have about}} an hour, Major. Do {{you think we}} can find it in an hour?" ...|$|E
6000|$|As we {{went down}} {{the steps of the}} hotel Mrs. Colesworthy looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] "It is twenty-five minutes to twelve," [...] she said. [...] "We must get home as fast as we can." ...|$|E
60|$|From {{the moment}} that George got the first glimpse of her face, he was troubled {{with one of those}} {{fleeting}} and indefinite likenesses, which almost every body can remember, and has been, at times, perplexed with. He could not keep himself from looking <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>watching</b> <b>her</b> perpetually. <b>At</b> table, or sitting <b>at</b> <b>her</b> state-room door, still she would encounter the young man's eyes fixed on her, and politely withdrawn, when she showed, by her countenance, that she was sensible to the observation.|$|R
60|$|MISS HOWARD. I know it's hard {{your being}} the only one up the week since you've been here, {{with no one to}} talk to; but there's another patient due to-day. Maybe she'll be well enough to be around with you. (With a quick glance <b>at</b> <b>her</b> wrist <b>watch.)</b> She can't be coming unless she got in on the last train.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{distance}} between us shrank, and the light hoar-frost thawed insensibly. Ere an hour elapsed I was <b>at</b> <b>her</b> side, <b>watching</b> <b>her</b> sew, gathering her sweet smiles and her merry words, which fell for me abundantly. We sat, as we {{had a right to}} sit, side by side; my arm rested on her chair; I was near enough to count the stitches of her work, and to discern the eye of her needle. The door suddenly opened.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> and was {{surprised}} to find how early it was. She could catch him at the office and make him take her out to lunch. She put on her hat and went out.|$|E
6000|$|Mildred looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> {{and found}} it was nearly four o’clock. With a little care in its {{administration}} the baby’s food might last until morning, but not longer. For themselves, they must be content without food, unless— ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. CLANDON. What {{on earth}} {{are they going to}} do? (Going out.) I really must go and stop this--- (She follows them, {{speaking}} as she disappears. Gloria stares coolly at Valentine, and then deliberately looks <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.)</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{a lonely}} child, she wandered by the seashore, {{and on the}} links of Burntisland, {{collecting}} shells and flowers or spent the clear, cold nights <b>at</b> <b>her</b> window, <b>watching</b> the starlit heavens, whose mysteries she was destined one day to penetrate in all their profound and sublime laws, making clear to others that knowledge which she herself had acquired, {{at the cost of}} so hard a struggle.|$|R
60|$|In Brussels {{women would}} be weeping; and Crystal--forlorn and desolate--would perhaps be sitting <b>at</b> <b>her</b> window <b>watching</b> the stream of fugitives that came in--wounded and exhausted--from the field of battle, recounting tales of a {{catastrophe}} which had no parallel in modern times: and Crystal, seeing and hearing this, would think of the man she loved, and believing him to be dead would break her heart with sorrow.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{years later}} {{in a movie theater}} in Ferrara, Silvano sees Carmen again and later {{approaches}} her outside. As they walk past the Castello Estense, she speaks of words that need to be spoken, but he says the only words worth speaking are hidden inside. Silvano walks Carmen to her home, where she reveals that she lived with a man for a year, and only recently he left her. [...] "Words do us good," [...] she tells Silvano, [...] "even in writing. A woman expects them. She always does." [...] Although seemingly attracted to Silvano, Carmen rebufs his attempted kiss, and he leaves. Later he returns to her room, they undress, and he passes his hand over her skin as if unable to touch her. They move to passionately kiss, but they do not. Finally, he leaves without making passionate love to her. Out in the street, he looks back <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watching</b> from a window.|$|R
