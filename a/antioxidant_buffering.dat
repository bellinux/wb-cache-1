40|$|THE {{causes of}} {{decreased}} muscle function associated with advanced aging are multifactorial and include muscle atrophy (sarcopenia), alterations in motor unit activ-ity, and declines in metabolic efficiency. Exercise is a coun-termeasure that is partially effective for reversing {{the loss of}} muscle function. Although muscles in aged mammals adapt to chronic resistance exercise via improved muscular strength and muscle fiber hypertrophy, these adaptations are generally smaller than that reported in muscles from younger adult humans and animals (1, 2). The mechanisms that regu-late this attenuated adaptation to resistance exercise with advanced aging (3) are unknown, {{but it is possible}} that this may be mediated at least, in part, by the detrimental sys-temic effects associated with elevated oxidative stress (4).

40|$|Purpose. Investigate {{free radical}} {{production}} and <b>antioxidant</b> <b>buffering</b> in military pentathletes’ saliva after their {{performance of a}} standardized, running-based anaerobic sprint test (RAST). Methods. Seven members of the Brazilian Navy pentathlon team were recruited to perform a running-based anaerobic test (~ 90 sec). The participants provided samples of saliva {{before and after the}} test that were analyzed for biomarkers of oxidative stress such as lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant capacity and the quantity of two specific antioxidants, glutathione and uric acid. Results. The lipid peroxidation increased ~ 2 fold after RAST, despite an increase in total antioxidant capacity (46 %). The concentration of reduced glutathione did not change, while the uric acid concentration increased by 65 %. Conclusions. The evaluation in saliva following a sprint test that lasted no more than 90 sec was sensitive enough to reveal changes in redox state...|$|E
40|$|Seed {{germination}} {{is critical}} for plant establishment but {{little is known about}} how the reduction-oxidation (redox) environment of the cells in the emerging root meristem influences cell division. The glutathione redox potentials of the nuclei and cytosol were determined using redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP 2) in the Arabidopsis root apical meristem, in which cell cycle had been synchronised using hydroxyurea, within the period immediately after germination, in order to characterise the relationships between cellular redox status and cell cycle progression. The average glutathione redox potentials of the nuclei and cytosol were - 297. 5 mV ± 0. 7 and - 292. 8 mV ± 0. 6 respectively. However, a transient oxidation occurred in compartments during the G 1 phase of the cell cycle, as determined by the expression of cell cycle markers (CYCB 1; 1 -GUS, cytrap and cyclins). The effect of low <b>antioxidant</b> <b>buffering</b> capacity on the gene expression profiles of dry and imbibed seeds as well as the redox potentials of the nuclei and cytosol was determined using the ascorbate deficient vtc 2 - 1 and vtc 2 - 4 mutants. The glutathione redox potentials of the nuclei in the proliferation zone of vtc 2 - 1 radicles expressing roGPF 2 were - 282. 3 mV ± 0. 5 and the cytosol was - 282. 9 mV ± 0. 5. These increased levels of oxidation persisted throughout the period of measurement, a feature that was linked to changes in cell cycle progression. The transcriptome profiles of vtc 2 - 1 and vtc 2 - 4 dry seeds compared with that of wild-type seeds revealed large changes in the abundance of transcripts encoding transcription factors, redox components, and proteins involved in cell cycle and secondary metabolism. Fewer differences were shown for the transcriptome profiles of vtc 2 - 1 and vtc 2 - 4 imbibed seeds. Taken together these data show that <b>antioxidant</b> <b>buffering</b> capacity exerts a strong influence on cell cycle progression and gene expression without having marked effects on germination...|$|E
40|$|Spirulina is a photosynthesizing cyanophyte {{used as an}} {{important}} source of protein. It is multicellular, filamentous, unbranched and helically coiled blue-green microalgae which is mass cultured. Environmental stress is the major limiting factor for mass cultivation due to disturbances in this normal redox state caused by oxidative damage at the cellular level. Low temperature affects the biochemical composition of Spirulina. The balance between different pathways is disrupted and uncoupled resulting in transfer of electrons that have high energy state to molecular oxygen (O 2) to form reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS damages DNA, PSII, carbon fixation process, enzymes activity, ATP production, causes lipid peroxidation and affects the protein flexibility & structural changes which results in initiation of apoptosis. To overcome the challenges of ROS the photosynthetic organisms developed robust <b>antioxidant</b> and redox <b>buffering</b> systems composed of enzymatic antioxidants and non-enzymatic antioxidants and also increases photorespiration. </span...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Rats were chronically fed a nutritionally {{complete}} liquid diet containing 35 % {{of total}} calories as either ethanol, or (for the controls) an isocaloric amount of glucose. After 6 weeks of treatment, the feeding regime induced skeletal muscle myopathy as characterised by reductions in muscle weight and RNA content. Ethanol preferentially affected the metabolically glycolytic plantaris (Type II fibre-predominant) muscle of the rat, {{compared with the}} metabolically oxidative soleus (Type I fibre-predominant). The changes in the plantaris were associated with increases in the concentration (u. mol per g wet weight) of anserine (18 %) and carnosine (50 %). No significant changes were seen for the concentrations of either anserine or carnosine in the soleus muscle. The total contents (u. mol per muscle) of carnosine and anserine in the plantaris were not significantly altered by ethanol treatment, though {{a significant decrease in}} anserine content (30 %) occurred in the soleus. It is concluded that reductions in imidazole dipeptide content, considered to be <b>antioxidants</b> and/or intracellular <b>buffering</b> agents, are not mediating factors in the development of chronic experimental myopathy...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo do trabalho foi elaborar salame tipo italiano, substituindo parcialmente o NaCl por solução de lactato de potássio a 60 % na razão de 0, 75 e 1, 5 %, e acompanhar, durante a etapa de permanência do produto dentro da câmara (zero, 2 º, 7 º, 14 º, 21 º e 30 º dia), algumas características físico-químicas (TBARS, pH, umidade, a w, NO 2) e microbiológicas (bactérias lácticas, Micrococcaceae, Staphylococcus xylosus) na superfície do salame. Observou-se que nas superfícies dos salames que continham 1, 5 % de lactato de potássio os valores de TBARS e o número de colônias das bactérias lácticas, Micrococcaceae e Staphylococcus xylosus, foram menores, enquanto os valores de umidade, a w e pH, foram maiores do que os valores encontrados nas superfícies dos salames contendo 0, 75 % de lactato de potássio. A concentração de 1, 5 % de lactato de potássio apresentou ação antioxidante e tamponante, enquanto a concentração de 0, 75 % favoreceu o processo de desidratação e o desenvolvimento das bactérias lácticas, Micrococcaceae e Staphylococcus xylosus. The aim of {{this work}} was the {{formulation}} of Italian salami with partial substitution of NaCl by a solution of potassium lactate 60 % at concentrations of 0. 75 and 1. 5 %. Some physicochemical (TBARS, pH, moisture, a w, NO 2) as well as microbiological characteristics (lactic bacteria, Micrococcaceae, Staphylococcus xylosus) were monitored {{on the surface of}} the salamis during storage (day zero, 2, 7, 14, 21, and 30). The results showed that {{on the surface of the}} salami prepared with 1. 5 % of potassium lactate the values of TBARS and the counting of lactic acid bacteria, Micrococcaceae and Staphylococcus xylosus were lower than the results found on the surface of salamis prepared with 0. 75 % of potassium lactate. On the other hand, the results of moisture, aw, and pH were higher on the surface of salamis with 1. 5 % of potassium lactate, than on the surface of salamis with 0. 75 % of the salt. The concentration of 1. 5 % of the lactate salt showed an <b>antioxidant</b> and <b>buffering</b> ability while the lower concentration favored the dehydration process and the growth of lactic bacteria, Micrococcaceae and Staphylococcus xylosus...|$|R
40|$|Redox {{status of}} the {{unloaded}} diaphragm 1 Oxidative stress is an important mediator of diaphragm muscle atrophy and contractile dysfunction during prolonged periods of controlled mechanical ventilation (MV). To date, specific details related {{to the impact of}} MV on diaphragmatic redox status remain unknown. To fill this void, we tested the hypothesis that MV-induced diaphragmatic oxidative stress is the consequence of both an elevation in intracellular oxidant production in conjunction with a decrease in the <b>antioxidant</b> <b>buffering</b> capacity. Adult rats were assigned to one of two experimental groups: 1) control; or 2) 12 hours of MV. Compared to controls, diaphragms from MV animals demonstrated increased oxidant production, diminished total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and decreased glutathione levels. Heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) mRNA and protein levels increased (+ 23. 0 and + 5. 1 fold, respectively) following MV.

40|$|Adipose tissue lies at {{the core}} of energy metabolism, by not only {{releasing}} and taking up fatty acids (FA) according to the individuals overall surplus or deficit of energy, but also signaling other tissues to regulate their own metabolism. In the event that adipose tissue function is lost, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis can develop. Despite the wealth of knowledge that exists for how mature adipocytes function in both normal and diseased states, preadipocytes, which can safe guard against adipocyte dysfunction by differentiating and joining the adipocyte pool, have been overlooked. Therefore, how human preadipocytes function {{in the presence of a}} mixture of FA (oleate, palmitate, stearate and linoleate) that resembles a healthy individual's adipose tissue microenvironment was investigated. Experiments using a novel real-time flow cytometry device show that the maximal rate of mitochondrial superoxide accumulation, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) production, and lipid peroxidation occurred within seconds of exposure to FA. Although mitochondrial ROS occurred in a transient fashion (within 2 hours), preadipocytes still experienced a loss in respiration through depletion of NAD+ and NADH that manifested into overt oxidative stress and cell death after 24 hours of FA exposure. Despite observing cell death in 35 % of our population, the majority of preadipocytes were able to mount a protective response through increases in the mitochondrial <b>antioxidant</b> <b>buffering</b> capacity. Investigation into FOXO 1, one of the transcription factors that govern mitochondrial antioxidant gene transcription, revealed an increase in deacetylation as soon as six hours post FA exposure. Inhibition of FOXO 1 or SIRT 1, which deacetylates FOXO 1, exacerbated the toxic effects of FA suggesting that the SIRT 1 -FOXO 1 axis may play a beneficial role in protecting preadipocytes from constant exposure to FA. Furthermore, SIRT 1, FOXO 1 and mitochondrial antioxidant gene expression from human adipose tissue was correlated to insulin sensitivity further highlighting the potential importance of mitochondrial <b>antioxidant</b> <b>buffering</b> systems in adipose tissue function. Altogether, this study suggests that the preadipocyte survivability is centered on mitochondrial resistance to FA-induced ROS through up regulation of mitochondrial antioxidant systems.   Ph.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that free radicals or {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) play a primary role in the ageing process, especially in those tissues in which their generation is more pronounced, such as skeletal muscle (Fulle, et al. 2004). With aging {{a reduction in the}} cellular <b>antioxidant</b> <b>buffering</b> mechanisms (Hepple et al. 2003) and an increase in ROS generation due to mitochondrial dysfunction result in an increase in the oxidative stress to which cells are exposed (Barreiro et al., 2006). This results in damage to muscle components including myofibrilar proteins. Although the etiology of sarcopenia is still under investigation, reduced physical activity and oxidative stress have been found {{to play an important role}} (Jang et al. 2010; Argilés et al. 2015). Sarcopenia should then be fought through specific training designed to reduce the loss in muscle mass while minimizing ROS production. In this respect, exercise can induce antioxidant adaptation, thereby balancing oxidative stress and damage in aging skeletal muscle (Ji, 2001, 2002). Hence the present study aimed at testing the hypothesis that an innovative medium-intensity (60 % 1 RM) resistive exercise program would be effective in increasing muscle mass and strength while minimizing ROS production and oxidative stress in older sarcopenic individuals...|$|E
40|$|Aims] A three-step {{catalytic}} cycle {{is common to}} all peroxiredoxins (Prxs), despite structural and kinetic differences. The second step in 1 -Cys type Prxs {{is a matter of}} debate since they lack an additional cysteine to play the resolving role, as happens with the 2 -Cys Prxs. The aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate the role of glutathione (GSH) in the thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial Prx 1 p, a 1 -Cys type Prx. [Results] The peroxidatic Cys 91 residue of two Prx 1 p peptides can be linked by a disulfide, which can be reduced by thioredoxin and by GSH (Km= 6. 1 ¿¿M). GSH forms a mixed disulfide with the peroxidatic cysteine spontaneously in vitro and in vivo. Mitochondrial Trx 3 p deglutathionylates Prx 1 p without formation of GSSG so that GSH is not consumed in the process. The structural unit of native Prx 1 p is a dimer whose subunits are not covalently linked, but a hexameric assembly of three disulfide-bound dimers can also be formed. [Innovation] GSH is presented as a protective cofactor of Prx 1 p, which is not consumed during the peroxidase reaction, but provides a robust mechanism as the resolving cysteine and efficiently prevents Prx 1 p overoxidation. GSH exerts these roles at concentrations well below those commonly considered necessary for its <b>antioxidant</b> and redox <b>buffering</b> functions. [Conclusion] A 1 -Cys peroxide scavenging mechanism operates in yeast mitochondria involving an autonomous glutathione molecule and the thioredoxin system, which could have universal validity. Prx 1 p is fairly well protected from overoxidation, questioning its role in a floodgate mechanism for H 2 O 2 signaling.

40|$|An {{important}} constituent of {{the cellular}} <b>antioxidant</b> <b>buffering</b> system {{that controls the}} redox state of proteins is thioredoxin (TRX), a 13 kDa protein that catalyzes thiol-disulfide exchange reactions, regulates activation of transcription factors, and possesses several other biologic functions similar to cytokines. We have previously reported that TRX released from UVB-irradiated keratinocytes stimulates melanogenesis by upregulating MSH receptor expression and its binding activity in melanocytes. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effects of TRX on keratinocytes as an autocrine factor. TRX suppressed the UVB-induced production and secretion of α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and also suppressed proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA expression by normal human keratinocytes; however, TRX upregulated melanocortin 1 receptor (MC 1 -R) expression synergistically with UVB in normal human keratinocytes. These results suggest that exogenous TRX regulates expression of those genes in different manners. Furthermore, addition of an antibody against TRX induced cell death in keratinocytes, probably due to enhanced signaling of MSH, as it has been shown that MSH suppresses heat shock protein (hsp) 70 expression in differentiated keratinocytes, which express high levels of MC 1 -R and decreases their survival rate during oxidative stress. Taken together, the results suggest that keratinocyte-derived TRX regulates the expression of stress inducible neuropeptides and their receptor, and is critically involved in the survival of keratinocytes...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that NO and its {{reactive}} derivative peroxynitrite are implicated in the patho-genesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Patients dying with MS demonstrate increased astrocytic inducible nitric oxide synthase activity, as well as increased levels of iNOS mRNA. Peroxynitrite is a strong oxidant capable of damaging target tissues, particularly the brain, which {{is known to be}} endowed with poor <b>antioxidant</b> <b>buffering</b> capacity. Inducible nitric oxide synthase is upregu-lated in the central nervous system (CNS) of animals with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and in patients with MS. We have recently demonstrated in patients with active MS a sig-nificant increase of NOS activity associated with increased nitration of proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Acetylcarnitine is proposed as a therapeutic agent for several neurodegenerative dis-orders. Accordingly, in the present study, MS patients were treated for 6 months with acetylcar-nitine and compared with untreated MS subjects or with patients noninflammatory neurological conditions, taken as controls. Western blot analysis showed in MS patients increased nitrosative stress associated with a significant decrease of reduced glutathione (GSH). Increased levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and nitrosothiols were also observed. Interestingly, treatment of MS patients with acetylcarnitine resulted in decreased CSF levels of NO reactive metabolites and protein nitration, as well as increased content of GSH and GSH/GSSG ratio. Our data sustain the hypothesis that nitrosative stress is a major consequence of NO produced in MS-affected CNS and implicate a possible important role for acetylcarnitine in protecting brain against nitrosative stress, which may underlie the pathogenesis of MS.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the possible involvement of oxidative mechanisms in {{the pathogenesis of}} influenza A/PR 8 / 34 virus infection in mice. As a biochemical marker of oxidative stress, we determined the endo-genous concentrations of the antioxidants glutathione and vitamins C and E in their reduced and oxidized forms in the lungs, liver and blood plasma of control and infected animals. Following intranasal infection with 8 to 10 LDso, influenza virus was detected in the lungs, {{but not in the}} plasma, liver or other organs. Infection resulted in a decrease in the total concen-tration of glutathione and vitamins C and E, whereas no relevant change in the ratio of oxidized to total concentration of antioxidants was observed. Changes in the concentration of hepatic antioxidants were significant {{in the early stages of}} the infection. The results suggest that hepatic alterations may be caused indirectly by mechanisms related to the host response to virus infection. The observed general decrease in the <b>antioxidant</b> <b>buffering</b> capacity may reduce the ability of tissues to protect against potential oxidative stress. Such stress can occur during bacterial superinfections, which are common in influenza, thereby rendering the host more susceptible to he pathogenic effects of such agents. In addition, reactive oxygen species produced in the lung may inactivate protease inhibitors, resulting in increased protease activity. Using an in vitro system consisting of 0 t 1 -antiprotease, trypsin and HOC 1 as the oxidant, we have shown that the infectivity of influenza viruses can be increased up to lO 000 -fold by proteo-lytic cleavage of haemagglutinin, leading to activation of the fusogenic properties of this protein...|$|E
