5|$|Certain {{mushrooms}} enjoy usage as therapeutics in folk medicines, such as Traditional Chinese medicine. Notable medicinal mushrooms with a well-documented {{history of}} use include Agaricus subrufescens, Ganoderma lucidum, and Ophiocordyceps sinensis. Research has identified compounds produced by {{these and other}} fungi that have inhibitory biological effects against viruses and cancer cells. Specific metabolites, such as polysaccharide-K, ergotamine, and β-lactam antibiotics, <b>are</b> <b>routinely</b> used in clinical medicine. The shiitake mushroom {{is a source of}} lentinan, a clinical drug approved for use in cancer treatments in several countries, including Japan. In Europe and Japan, polysaccharide-K (brand name Krestin), a chemical derived from Trametes versicolor, is an approved adjuvant for cancer therapy.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{producing}} {{a new series of}} spots on the television front, the chain reused the commercials originally produced by Crispin, Porter + Bogusky from the initial product run. These commercials were only played on Thursdays, specifically for the social media meme known as Throwback Thursday, events that feature historical personal stories or happenings that <b>are</b> <b>routinely</b> run on various sites such as Facebook or Instagram. The only major change to the advertisements was the addition of the hashtag TBT to the lower left-hand corner of the video.|$|E
5|$|It {{may not be}} {{possible}} to observe every atom in the asymmetric unit. In many cases, disorder smears the electron density map. Weakly scattering atoms such as hydrogen <b>are</b> <b>routinely</b> invisible. It is also possible for a single atom to appear multiple times in an electron density map, e.g., if a protein sidechain has multiple (<4) allowed conformations. In still other cases, the crystallographer may detect that the covalent structure deduced for the molecule was incorrect, or changed. For example, proteins may be cleaved or undergo post-translational modifications that were not detected prior to the crystallization.|$|E
5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} unaware {{that they are}} {{infected}} with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research <b>are</b> <b>routinely</b> screened for HIV.|$|E

5|$|Several {{key issues}} <b>are</b> <b>routinely</b> raised by musicians and music scholars, when {{discussing}} {{the performance of}} Schubert's compositions for piano. These discussions also concern the last piano sonatas.

5|$|The {{brooding}} anemone (Epiactis prolifera) is gynodioecious, starting life as {{a female}} and later becoming hermaphroditic, so that populations consist of females and hermaphrodites. As a female, the eggs can develop parthenogenetically into female offspring without fertilisation, and as a hermaphrodite, the eggs <b>are</b> <b>routinely</b> self-fertilised. The larvae emerge from the anemone's mouth and tumble down the column, lodging in a fold near the pedal disc. Here they develop and grow, remaining for about three months before crawling off to start independent lives.|$|E
5|$|The {{toxicity}} of finely divided beryllium (dust or powder, mainly encountered in industrial settings where beryllium is produced or machined) is very well-documented. Solid beryllium metal does not carry the same hazards as airborne inhaled dust, but any hazard associated with physical contact is poorly documented. Workers handling finished beryllium pieces <b>are</b> <b>routinely</b> advised {{to handle them}} with gloves, both as a precaution and because many if not most applications of beryllium cannot tolerate residue of skin contact such as fingerprints.|$|E

They are also considered one of the charismatic megafauna, and are used as the face of conservation campaigns worldwide. In a 2004 online poll conducted by cable television channel Animal Planet, involving more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries, the tiger was voted the world's favourite animal with 21% of the vote, narrowly beating the dog.|$|E
5|$|Western Australia {{banned the}} import of common {{starlings}} in 1895. New flocks arriving from the east <b>are</b> <b>routinely</b> shot, while the less cautious juveniles are trapped and netted. New methods are being developed, such as tagging one bird and tracking it back to establish where {{other members of the}} flock roost. Another technique is to analyse the DNA of Australian common starling populations to track where the migration from eastern to western Australia is occurring so that better preventive strategies can be used. By 2009, only 300 common starlings were left in Western Australia, and the state committed a further A$400,000 in that year to continue the eradication programme.|$|E
5|$|Commercial diving {{operations}} may {{expose the}} diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational {{health and safety}} legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial diving operations are also constrained by the physical realities of the operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial diving operation, and this is also the case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense <b>are</b> <b>routinely</b> incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.|$|E

5|$|During the {{processing}} of bauxite to alumina in the Bayer process, gallium accumulates in the sodium hydroxide liquor. From this it can be extracted {{by a variety of}} methods. The most recent is the use of ion-exchange resin. Achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on the original concentration in the feed bauxite. At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15 % of the contained gallium is extractable. The remainder reports to the red mud and aluminium hydroxide streams. Gallium is removed from the ion-exchange resin in solution. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, it is further purified with zone melting or single-crystal extraction from a melt (Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% <b>are</b> <b>routinely</b> achieved and commercially available.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{electrical}} plant {{construction and}} well drilling cost about €2–5million perMW of electrical capacity, while the break–even price is 0.04–0.10€ perkW·h. Enhanced geothermal systems {{tend to be}} on the high side of these ranges, with capital costs above $4million perMW and break–even above $0.054 perkW·h in 2007. Direct heating applications can use much shallower wells with lower temperatures, so smaller systems with lower costs and risks are feasible. Residential geothermal heat pumps with a capacity of 10kilowatt (kW) <b>are</b> <b>routinely</b> installed for around $1–3,000 perkilowatt. District heating systems may benefit from economies of scale if demand is geographically dense, as in cities and greenhouses, but otherwise piping installation dominates capital costs. The capital cost of one such district heating system in Bavaria was estimated at somewhat over 1million€ perMW. Direct systems of any size are much simpler than electric generators and have lower maintenance costs perkW·h, but they must consume electricity to run pumps and compressors. Some governments subsidize geothermal projects.|$|E
5|$|Most strokes {{result from}} loss of blood supply, {{typically}} {{because of an}} embolus, rupture of a fatty plaque or narrowing of small arteries. Strokes can also result from bleeding within the brain. Transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) are strokes in which symptoms resolve within 24 hours. Investigation into the stroke will involve a medical examination (including a neurological examination) and the taking of a medical history, focusing on {{the duration of the}} symptoms and risk factors (including high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and smoking). Further investigation is needed in younger patients. An ECG and biotelemetry may be conducted to identify atrial fibrillation; an ultrasound can investigate narrowing of the carotid arteries; an echocardiogram can be used to look for clots within the heart, diseases of the heart valves or the presence of a patent foramen ovale. Blood tests <b>are</b> <b>routinely</b> done as part of the workup including diabetes tests and a lipid profile.|$|E
