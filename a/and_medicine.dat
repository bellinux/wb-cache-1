40|$|Aims. To {{investigate}} patients' {{attitudes toward}} complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine,</b> the education nurses provided about complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine</b> for treating depression and {{to test whether}} such education mediates the effect of complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine</b> use <b>and</b> attitudes toward complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine.</b> Background. Although we know that attitudes influence behaviour, very few studies simultaneously explore the relationship between attitudes, education and complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine</b> use. Design. Survey. Methods. This study was conducted {{as part of a}} larger survey, using face-to-face survey interviews with 206 adult patients aged 50 years or over and hospitalised in conventional hospitals in Taiwan for treatment of depression. The attitudes toward complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> patient education about complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine</b> instruments were specially developed for the study. Results. Participants expressed slightly favourable attitudes toward complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine.</b> Many participants (50 %) expressed that they were willing to try any potential treatment for depression. They believed that complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine</b> helped them to feel better and to live a happier life. However, 66 絥 of participants reported that they had inadequate knowledge of complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine.</b> Participants with a higher monthly income, longer depression duration and religious beliefs hold more positive attitudes toward complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine.</b> Most participants were not satisfied with the education they received about complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine.</b> Patient education about complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine</b> was found to be a mediator for the use of complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine.</b> Conclusion. Patient education from nurses may predict patients' attitudes toward complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine.</b> Continuing nursing education is needed to enable nurses to respond knowledgeably to concerns patients may have about complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> treatment options. Relevance to clinical practice. This study highlights the potential role of patient education about complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine</b> as an effective way of adjusting patients' attitudes toward complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> to link both patients' preferences for complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> health professionals' concerns about the proper use of complementary <b>and</b> alternative <b>medicine</b> for depression management and adverse drug interactions.
