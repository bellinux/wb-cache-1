Then as well as now, many of the virtual study programs were mainly based on text documents, but multimedia technologies have become increasingly popular as well. These web-based delivery modes are used in order to expand access to programs and services that can be offered anytime and anywhere. The spectrum of teaching modes in virtual education includes courses based on hypertext, videos, <b>audios,</b> <b>e-mails,</b> and video conferencing. Teaching on the web through courseware such as WebCT and Blackboard are also used. See Virtual education.|$|R

40|$|During the {{relatively}} short-duration Space Shuffle missions, a psychological support {{program for the}} astronauts has not been required. Such missions primarily require providing occasional communication with family members by means of <b>audio,</b> video or <b>e-mail,</b> and some diversions such as CD players. During the NASA-Mir Program, conducted from March 1995 through June 1998, mission duration increased to 4 - 6 months. As {{a result of these}} changes it was necessary for NASA to establish an operational Human Behavior and Performance Group (HBPG) to develop and implement a comprehensive program of psychological support. The Mir experience provided the opportunity to develop and implement a psychological support program for long-duration space missions. Many factors influence the support program, including individual preferences, mission duration, and environmental factors such as habitable and personal areas. Lessons learned from the Mir experience are being applied to improve the ISS psychological support program plan. This presentation will address which includes various preflight, in-flight, and post-flight support activities and tools that NASA's HBPG will provide to astronauts and their families for ISS missions...|$|R

Swann and Campbell, here to investigate multiple incidents, have a heated conference meeting with {{the man in charge}} of the Mars laboratories, Dr. Malcolm Betruger while the marine heads to Master Sergeant Thomas Kelly for orders. Kelly gives the marine instructions to find a scientist from the Delta Labs who has gone missing. The marine finds the scientist in a nearby decommissioned communications facility, where he is frantically trying to send a warning to the UAC on Earth about Betruger's teleportation experiments. However, as he tries to explain the situation to the marine, another teleportation test takes place and loses containment, at which point the entire Mars base is swept with an unnatural shockwave. This transforms most of the base's personnel into zombies as the forces of Hell invade through the teleporter's portal.|$|R

40|$|The growing {{popularity}} of new generation mobile terminals, known as „smartphones‟, has increased the variety and number of such devices. These devices {{make use of the}} resources offered by Universal Mobile Telecommunication Services (UMTS) networks to access on-line services such as web browsing, <b>e-mail,</b> <b>audio</b> and video streaming, etc. UMTS networks have to deal with an increasing amount of data traffic generated by smartphones. Because {{of the fact that the}} smartphone is battery powered and is trying to satisfy the needs of both applications and human users there is a need to be smarter about how to manage both network and terminal resources. This thesis explores the possibility of making a better use of the network and terminal resources by exploiting correlations in the events of the smartphone-generated traffic. We propose a mechanism, through which the network can predict if a terminal is going to produce data transmission or reception in a near future, based on past events in its traffic. According to this prediction, the network will be able to decide if it keeps or releases the resources allocated to the terminal. We analyze the benefits from the network and the terminal point o...|$|R

40|$|Recent audit {{research}} has indicated that junior auditors tend to use e-mail for client inquiries. Additionally, audit firms have expressed concerns regarding the ability of junior auditors to communicate professionally. In this study, I investigate whether receiving an auditor inquiry via e-mail differentially affects client responses as compared to more traditional modes of inquiry and whether those responses are affected by the auditor’s professional tone. In an experiment, experienced business professionals respond to a request for information from an auditor regarding a potential accounting adjustment. I varied the communication mode of the request (<b>e-mail,</b> <b>audio,</b> or visual) and the professional tone of the communication (more vs. less professional tone) and then measured the extent to which participants revealed information that either supported or did not support the client’s accounting position. I find that an auditor e-mail inquiry results in client responses that are more biased towards items that support the client’s position as compared to audio or visual inquiries. In addition, I find that clients respond in a more biased manner when the inquiry is worded in a less professional tone as compared to a more professional tone and that this tendency may be exacerbated when they receive the request via e-mail. Further underscoring the implications of these findings for audit outcomes, I find that clients are less likely to agree with an auditor’s proposed income-decreasing adjustment if the client did not personally reveal applicable information to the auditor...|$|R

This current study has researched on the various existing Multiuser detection (MUD) processes or proposals conducted by various research institutions around the world. It has identified the advantages that the past work offers, and it is these advantages that form the basis of the current research into the improvement techniques. The proposed Partial Parallel Pipelined Multiuser Detector (PPPMUD or P 3 MUD) has come about from two main flavours or directions of research. The first one seeks to promote the Soft Parallel Interference Cancellation technique as an effective bias mitigation technique. This bias occurring in the second stage decision statistics, exhibits a very harmful effect on system Bit Error Rate, (BER), particularly for large system loads. This current study goes further by carefully analysing the Soft Cancellation Factor, SCF behaviour to eventually derive and determine the optimum SCF value which exhibits positive characteristics when varied with the increasing system load (number of users). This optimum SCF value is called the universal SCF or SCFUNV, as it is theoretically supposed to perform favourably under various system loads. A favourable or acceptable performance would be characterised by low observed or measured BER during the system processing stages. A further enhancement to the operational performance of the SCFUNV algorithm is the SCFUNV Compensator, which is basically a compensation mechanism created by modelling the behaviour of the SCF values, and adjusts the SCFUNV depending on the system load, (number of simultaneous users). Thus, the SCFUNV is adaptively adjusted in order to perform acceptably under all load conditions. The second direction of research, as regards improvements in MUD techniques, involves the conventional Bit-Streaming, Pipelined Multiuser Detector. This came about due to the computational complexity as well as matrix inversions which affected earlier asynchronous multiuser detection techniques. This detector has a pipelined architecture which avoids multishot (block-based) detection and instead, processes the bits in a streaming fashion. The architecture consists of a matched filter followed by three stages of parallel interference cancellation, (PIC). This present study extends that research by outlining the advantages of incorporating the soft parallel interference cancellation technique, by way of the universal soft cancellation factor, (SCFUNV), into the conventional pipelined multiuser detector architecture to form the P 3 MUD architecture, which includes the compensator. The contributions of the proposed P 3 MUD system is that the observed BER output simulations are promising, with an observed overall decrease in the error rate for the P 3 MUD process, as compared to the conventional pipelined detection method. This decrease signifies an improvement offered by the proposed (P 3 MUD) algorithm. Further observed analysis indicates the possibility of decreasing the number of parallel interference cancellation stages from three to at least two, after the matched filter detection stage, without an observable change in system BER. Hence, the proposal of the two-stage P 3 MUD. Dissertation (MEng (Electronic)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006. Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineeringunrestricte...|$|R
