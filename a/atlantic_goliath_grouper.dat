25|$|Marine biota in {{the region}} have representatives of both the Indian and Pacific oceans which were caught in the Caribbean before the {{emergence}} of the Isthmus of Panama four million years ago. In the Caribbean Sea there are around 1,000 documented species of fish, including sharks (bull shark, tiger shark, silky shark and Caribbean reef shark), flying fish, giant oceanic manta ray, angel fish, spotfin butterflyfish, parrotfish, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Goliath</b> <b>grouper,</b> tarpon and moray eels. Throughout the Caribbean there is industrial catching of lobster and sardines (off the coast of Yucatán Peninsula).|$|E
25|$|The Formigas Bank is {{essentially}} a submarine volcano, inhabited by deep-dwelling marine species, coral and sponges. The cone is delimited approximately by the islets of the northwest and the Dollabarats reef to the southeast. In the ancient crater there is a rich community of species common to the Azores. Among the species typical of the area are wrasse (Mediterranean rainbow wrasse, ornate wrasse), damselfish, sergeant fish (yellow and black), grouper, Mediterranean parrotfish, and the emblematic <b>Atlantic</b> <b>goliath</b> <b>grouper,</b> Serranidae and barred hogfish. Alongside these are pelagic predators that also reside in the bank (African threadfish, longbill spearfish) and migratory species that travel between destinations (like the manta ray and whale shark).|$|E

40|$|The ecology, {{particularly}} the trophic ecology, of the Critically Endangered <b>goliath</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus itajara (Lichtenstein 1822) in French Guiana (France) is relatively unknown. Such information {{would provide a}} better understanding of the role that <b>goliath</b> <b>groupers</b> play in the marine ecosystem of French Guiana. This study focused on the feeding ecology of the <b>goliath</b> <b>grouper</b> through stomach-content and stable-isotope analyses of captured specimens. The dietary composition of <b>goliath</b> <b>groupers</b> in French Guiana was similar to that of <b>goliath</b> <b>groupers</b> from other areas of the species' range. However, in French Guiana, <b>goliath</b> <b>groupers</b> exhibited an ontogenetic shift in diet that has not been demonstrated elsewhere. Crustaceans, primarily crabs, were dominant in the diet of smaller individuals (< 120 cm), whereas demersal fishes, particularly catfish (Siluriformes), dominated the diet of larger individuals. Analysis of delta C- 13 and delta N- 15 in muscle samples indicated that: (1) larger fish fed more on higher trophic levels; (2) low seasonal and spatial variation existed in the diet; and (3) an apparent migration of early juveniles occurred from mangrove areas to rocky reefs. In French Guiana, adult and juvenile <b>goliath</b> <b>groupers</b> share marine rocky habitat, and the data suggest they may avoid food competition by a shift in diet with size...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} {{survival}} {{and growth of}} juvenile Pacific <b>goliath</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus quinquefasciatus) in captivity at low salinities. Materials and methods. We randomly selected twelve juvenile <b>goliath</b> <b>groupers</b> with an average standard length of 44. 2 ± 6. 1 cm and 1492 ± 476 g in body weight, and raised them for three months in the laboratory in waters of 32 - 26, 20, 10 and 5 parts per thousand of salinity. Results. All juvenile Pacific <b>goliath</b> <b>groupers</b> tolerated the initial gradual transfer from full strength seawater to salinities of 32 - 26, 20, 10, and 5 parts per thousand, which was done {{over a period of}} four days.

40|$|<b>Goliath</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus itajara) aggregations and {{relative}} abundances were described and mapped {{through the use}} of fishermen's local ecological knowledge in Babitonga Bay in southern Brazil. Six well-experienced informants were asked to individually provide information about <b>goliath</b> <b>grouper</b> abundance and distribution, drawn over a satellite image of the study area, which was later overlaid and gathered into a final map. According to our informants, the <b>goliath</b> <b>grouper</b> occurs along a broad salinity and depth range, from shallow estuarine areas (less than 5 m deep) with high freshwater input (smaller individuals, up to 150 kg) to coastal marine-dominated environments (at least 35 m deep); (larger individuals more common, frequently reaching more than 300 kg). Fishermen referred to <b>goliath</b> <b>groupers</b> inhabiting hard substrates such as rocky reefs around islands and continental shores, submerged rocky outcrops and shipwrecks (juveniles and adults). At least two aggregation sites mapped (ranging from 2 to 60 individuals) could be concluded as spawning aggregation sites through evidence of high abundance and spawning activity. Priority research and conservation targets were identified and discussed for Babitonga Bay (e. g., design of a tagging experimental program and establishment of a marine protected area). Fishers' resource mapping provided a means of exchanging information among various disciplines while maintaining methodological rigor in a clear and straightforward way of presenting fishers' knowledge. The use of fishers' sketch maps is a promising tool for marine conservation in Brazil, with special regard to adaptive co-management regimes, where frequent environmental re-evaluations are needed...|$|R

50|$|<b>Goliath</b> <b>groupers</b> are {{believed}} to be protogynous hermaphrodites, with individuals first maturing as females and only some large adults becoming males. Most groupers follow this pattern, but it has not yet been verified for the goliath.

50|$|<b>Goliath</b> <b>groupers</b> are {{believed}} to be protogynous hermaphrodites, which refer to organisms that are born female and {{at some point in their}} lifespans change sex to male.

50|$|They {{may reach}} {{extremely}} large sizes, growing to lengths of 8.2 feet (2.5 m) and can weigh {{as much as}} 800 pounds (363 kg). They are usually around 400 lb when mature.

They also tend to spawn in large aggregations returning like clockwork to the same locations making them particularly vulnerable to mass harvesting.|$|R
