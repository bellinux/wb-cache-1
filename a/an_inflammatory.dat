However, within the last decade, studies have observed microscopic anatomical changes indicating that plantar fasciitis is actually due to a noninflammatory structural breakdown of the plantar fascia rather than <b>an</b> <b>inflammatory</b> process.|$|E
5|$|Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is <b>an</b> <b>inflammatory</b> {{lung disease}} of unknown cause. It is a severe, {{progressive}} form of bronchiolitis, <b>an</b> <b>inflammatory</b> {{condition of the}} bronchioles (small air passages in the lungs). The term diffuse signifies that lesions appear throughout both lungs, while panbronchiolitis refers to inflammation found in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles (those involved in gas exchange). DPB causes severe inflammation and nodule-like lesions of terminal bronchioles, chronic sinusitis, and intense coughing with large amounts of sputum production.|$|E

5|$|A less {{invasive}} {{approach is}} thoracoscopy, {{usually in the}} form of a procedure called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The results from VATS-based pleural abrasion are slightly worse than those achieved using thoracotomy in the short term, but produce smaller scars in the skin. Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS offers a shorter in-hospital stays, less need for postoperative pain control, and a reduced risk of lung problems after surgery. VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis; this involves insufflation of talc, which activates <b>an</b> <b>inflammatory</b> reaction that causes the lung to adhere to the chest wall.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{patients}} present without any known risk factors evident, {{a number of}} risk factors {{for the development of}} cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, the most common of these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), <b>an</b> <b>inflammatory</b> disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. The mechanism by which PSC increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|Like other animals, fish {{suffer from}} {{diseases}} and parasites. To prevent disease {{they have a}} variety of defenses. Non-specific defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. If pathogens breach these defenses, fish can develop <b>an</b> <b>inflammatory</b> response that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an immune response. In recent years, vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example furunculosis vaccines in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koi.|$|E

5|$|Most {{men have}} a normal sperm count, but a high {{proportion}} of sperm are abnormal; they are less motile and do not survive as well. The reason for these abnormalities is not known, but research points to dysfunction of the seminal vesicles and prostate, which concentrate substances that are toxic to sperm. Cytokines, immune proteins which promote <b>an</b> <b>inflammatory</b> response, are present at higher concentrations in semen of men with SCI, as is platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase; both are harmful to sperm. Another immune-related response to SCI is the presence of a higher number of white blood cells in the semen.|$|E
5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} {{is caused}} by either a single instance of acute trauma to the knee, or repeated minor trauma to the knee. The trauma can cause extravasation of nearby fluids into the bursa, which stimulates <b>an</b> <b>inflammatory</b> response. This response occurs in two phases: The vascular phase, in which the {{blood flow to the}} surrounding area increases, and the cellular phase, in which leukocytes migrate from the blood to the affected area. Other possible causes include gout, sarcoidosis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, uremia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some cases are idiopathic, though these may be caused by trauma that the patient does not remember.|$|E
5|$|Prominent {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cholangiocarcinoma include abnormal liver function tests, abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss. Other symptoms such as generalized itching, fever, and changes in color of stool or urine may also occur. The disease is diagnosed through a combination of blood tests, imaging, endoscopy, and sometimes surgical exploration, with confirmation obtained after a pathologist examines cells from the tumor under a microscope. Known risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include primary sclerosing cholangitis (<b>an</b> <b>inflammatory</b> disease of the bile ducts), infection with the parasitic liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini or Clonorchis sinensis, some congenital liver malformations, and exposure to Thorotrast (thorium dioxide), a chemical formerly used in medical imaging.

5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} {{the most common cause of}} COPD, with factors such as air {{pollution}} and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes <b>an</b> <b>inflammatory</b> response in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve much with the use of a bronchodilator.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Hitler's release from prison, {{politics}} in Germany had become less combative and the economy had improved, limiting Hitler's opportunities for political agitation. As {{a result of the}} failed Beer Hall Putsch, the NSDAP and its affiliated organisations were banned in Bavaria. In a meeting with the Prime Minister of Bavaria Heinrich Held on 4 January 1925, Hitler agreed to respect the state's authority and promised that he would seek political power only through the democratic process. The meeting {{paved the way for the}} ban on the NSDAP to be lifted on 16 February. However, after <b>an</b> <b>inflammatory</b> speech he gave on 27 February, Hitler was barred from public speaking by the Bavarian authorities, a ban that remained in place until 1927. To advance his political ambitions in spite of the ban, Hitler appointed Gregor Strasser, Otto Strasser and Joseph Goebbels to organise and grow the NSDAP in northern Germany. Gregor Strasser steered a more independent political course, emphasising the socialist elements of the party's programme.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we study the {{inflammatory}} process {{resulting in the}} development of atherosclerosis. We develop a one- and two-dimensional models based on reaction-diffusion systems to describe the set up of <b>a</b> chronic <b>inflammatory</b> response in the intima of an artery vessel wall. The concentration of the oxidized low density lipoproteins (ox-LDL) in the intima is the critical parameter of the model. Low ox-LDL concentrations do not lead to <b>a</b> chronic <b>inflammatory</b> reaction. Intermediate ox-LDL concentrations correspond to a bistable system and can lead to a travelling wave propagation corresponding to <b>a</b> chronic <b>inflammatory</b> reaction. In this case the disease development depends on the initial condition. If the concentration of monocytes in the intima is sufficiently high, which can be caused by an inflammation related to other factors, then the development of atherosclerosis can start. Otherwise, the system returns to the stable disease free equilibrium. High ox-LDL concentrations correspond to a monostable system and even a small perturbation of the non inflammatory case leads to a travelling wave propagation which corresponds to <b>a</b> chronic <b>inflammatory</b> response.

5|$|Upon {{going to}} war against France, the British Royal Navy began intercepting ships of neutral {{countries}} bound for French ports. The French imported large amounts of American foodstuffs, and the British hoped to starve the French into defeat by intercepting these shipments. In November 1793 the British government widened the scope of these seizures to include any neutral ships trading with the French West Indies, including those flying the American flag. By the following March, over 250 U.S. merchant ships had been seized and their crews impressed. Americans were outraged, and angry protests erupted in several cities. Many Jeffersonians in Congress demanded a declaration of war, but Congressman James Madison instead called for strong economic retaliation, including an embargo on all trade with Britain. Further inflaming anti-British sentiment in Congress, news arrived while the matter was under debate that the Governor General of British North America, Lord Dorchester, had made <b>an</b> <b>inflammatory</b> speech inciting the Indians in the Northwest Territory against the Americans.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} different blood glucose levels on viscera injury, oxidative stress response and Wnt 5 <b>a</b> <b>inflammatory</b> pathway in children with sepsis. Methods: 70 children with sepsis treated in our hospital between January 2014 and December 2015 were retrospectively collected and divided into the sepsis group A (blood glucose ＞ 10 mmol/L) (n= 29) and the sepsis group B (blood glucose ≤ 10 mmol/L) (n= 41) according to the different blood glucose levels, and 50 healthy children who accepted vaccination and were with normal blood glucose levels in our hospital {{during the same period}} were selected as healthy control group. The day after admission, RIA method was used to determine liver function indexes; automatic biochemical analyzer was used to determine oxidative stress indexes; enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect Wnt 5 <b>a</b> <b>inflammatory</b> pathway index levels. Results: Liver function indexes total bilirubin (TBIL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels of sepsis group A were higher than those of sepsis group B and healthy control group (P< 0. 05); oxidative stress indexes advanced protein oxidation products (AOPPs), lipid hydrogen peroxide (LHP), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were higher than those of sepsis group B and healthy control group while glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) level was lower than that of sepsis group B and healthy control group (P< 0. 05); serum Wnt 5 <b>a</b> <b>inflammatory</b> pathway indexes interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) and macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 β (MIP- 1 β) levels were higher than those of sepsis group B and healthy control group (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: Sepsis children with high blood glucose are with severe liver function damage as well as intense oxidative stress and inflammatory response, which are the important indexes for severe illness and poor prognosis...|$|R
