40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to test {{innovative}} approach for enhancing <b>ascorbyl</b> palmitate stability in microemulsions for topical application by addition of newly synthesized co-antioxidant 4 -(tridecyloxy) benzaldehyde oxime (TDBO) and to investigate its antioxidant activity and finally to evaluate cytotoxicity of TDBO-loaded microemulsions on keratinocyte cells. TDBO significantly increased <b>ascorbyl</b> palmitate stability in oil-dispersed-in-water (o/w) microemulsions, most presumably due to reduction of <b>ascorbyl</b> palmitate radical back to <b>ascorbyl</b> palmitate, since TDBO free-radical scavenging activity was confirmed.

Blank and iron (Fe) loaded nanocarriers were prepared by a modified thin film method using <b>ascorbyl</b> palmitate and DSPE-PEG. Surface charge of the nanocarriers was modified by the inclusion of chitosan (CHI) during the formulation process. Blank and iron loaded <b>ascorbyl</b> palmitate/DSPE nanocarriers were visualised by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and physiochemical characterisations of the nanocarriers carried out to determine the mean particle size and zeta potential. Inclusion of chitosan imparted a net positive charge on the nanocarrier surface and also led to an increase in mean particle size. Iron entrapment in <b>ascorbyl</b> palmitate-Fe and <b>ascorbyl</b> palmitate-CHI-Fe nanocarriers was 67 % and 76 % respectively, suggesting a beneficial effect of chitosan on nanocarrier Fe entrapment.

40|$|International audienceAscorbyl {{lipophilic}} derivatives (Asc-C 2 to Asc-C(18 : 1)) were synthesized {{in a good}} yield using lipase from Staphylococcus xylosus {{produced in}} our laboratory and immobilized onto silica aerogel. Results showed that esterification {{had little effect on}} radical-scavenging capacity of purified <b>ascorbyl</b> esters using DPPH assay in ethanol. However, long chain fatty acid esters displayed higher protection of target lipids from oxidation. Moreover, compared to ascorbic acid, synthesized derivatives exhibited an antibacterial effect. Furthermore, <b>ascorbyl</b> derivatives were evaluated, for the first time, for their antileishmanial effects against visceral (Leishmania infantum) and cutaneous parasites (Leishmania major). Among all the tested compounds, only Asc-C 10, Asc-C 12, and Asc-C(18 : 1) exhibited antileishmanial activities. The interaction of <b>ascorbyl</b> esters with a phospholipid monolayer showed that only medium and unsaturated long chain (Asc-C 10 to Asc-C(18 : 1)) derivative esters were found to interact efficiently with mimetic membrane of leishmania.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of ascorbate oxidation was studied in rat liver microsomes. A continuous {{consumption of the}} added ascorbate was observed, which was accompanied with a prompt appearance of <b>ascorbyl</b> free radical and dehydroascorbate. Microsomes sustained steady-state level of <b>ascorbyl</b> free radical and dehydroascorbate till ascorbate was present in the medium. <b>Ascorbyl</b> free radical formation was diminished when microsomes had been pretreated with heat or trypsine. It was also decreased by addition of quercetin, econazole or metal chelators, including the copper specific neocuproine. Enzymatic (superoxide dismutase, catalase) and nonenzymatic (dimethyl sulfoxide, mannitol) antioxidants did not modify the microsomal production of <b>ascorbyl</b> free radical. Investigation of the subcellular distribution of ascorbate oxidation showed that the microsomal fraction of liver had the highest activity. The decrease of ascorbate oxidation after protease treatment and the negligible increase upon permeabilization of microsomal vesicles showed that a membrane protein {{is responsible for the}} activity, which is exposed to the outer surface of the endoplasmic reticulum.

Homology modelling of alpha 2 -gliadin and computational screening of compounds for their binding affinity to a common TG 2 binding motive (P) QLP were done by using computational approaches followed by experimental testing of TG 2 activity.
