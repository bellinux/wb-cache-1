5|$|One {{reason for}} the lack of sales, and for the poor {{condition}} of many surviving specimens, was that while the fair was open, the economic Panic of 1893 began, one of the worst depressions in the nation's history—fifty cents could make the difference between a family eating or starving {{at a time when the}} average visitor to the fair spent $1.18. Fairgoers were disinclined to exchange <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> for a fifty-cent piece, and those who had bought Columbian half dollars before the crash often spent their souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|The 1804 dollar or Bowed Liberty Dollar was <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> coin {{struck by}} the Mint of the United States, of which fifteen {{specimens}} are currently known to exist.

5|$|A severe depression, the Panic of 1873, {{began in}} the same year as passage of the act, and persisted for much of the decade. Many in the United States came to believe the gold {{standard}} too rigid to deal with economic hard times like those, and sought to restore bimetallism. The inflation caused by such a policy would enable debtors to repay what they owed more easily. The price of silver continued to fall—the silver in <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> in the new metric-weight subsidiary silver coins was worth only $.75 by mid-1876, though the price recovered some after that.|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd All rights reserved. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Bone metastases causing neuropathic pain (NBP) have {{traditionally}} been treated with fractionated radiotherapy (RT). A recently reported randomised Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group trial (TROG 96. 05) supports this approach in many cases [Roos DE, Turner SL, O'Brien PC et al. Randomised trial of 8 Gy in 1 versus 20 Gy in 5 fractions of radiotherapy for neuropathic pain due to bone metastases (Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group, TROG 96. 05). Radiother Oncol 2005; 75 : 54 - 63]. This study sought to compare costs to the Australian health-care system for patients receiving 1 versus 5 fractions for NBP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The RT and medication costs for 245 patients treated on TROG 96. 05 were determined from trial data out to 3 months from RT. Admission costs and causes were derived from hospital records. RESULTS: RT costs (including re-treatments) were calculated to be 222 and 724 Australian <b>dollars</b> (<b>A</b> <b>dollars)</b> per patient for the 8 Gy/ 1 and 20 Gy/ 5 arms, respectively. This difference increased when analgesics (<b>A</b> <b>dollars</b> 192 versus <b>A</b> <b>dollars</b> 229) and related hospital admissions (<b>A</b> <b>dollars</b> 1, 411 versus <b>A</b> <b>dollars</b> 1, 893) were considered. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated an incremental cost saving of between <b>A</b> <b>dollars</b> 795 and <b>A</b> <b>dollars</b> 1, 468 for single fraction RT. Admission rates had the strongest potential to distort cost differences. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical outcomes are paramount in choice of fractionation scheme but are optimally considered {{in the light of}} economic implications. Overall cost differences between fractionation schedules may vary greatly from those incurred by the RT treatment centre alone. Ideally, such economic evaluations should be planned at the outset of a trial. Christine A. Pollicino, Sandra L. Turner, Daniel E. Roos, and Peter C. O'Brie...|$|R

5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, Ace's output was {{approaching}} one hundred titles a year, still heavily {{dominated by the}} primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half <b>a</b> <b>dollar.</b> In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced {{an increase in the}} price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of Frank Herbert's Dune, were priced at 95 cents. With Ballantine Books, Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, the Mint {{had begun}} to strike {{copper-nickel}} clad coins instead of silver, due to rises in bullion prices. No dollar coins had been issued in thirty years, and none, initially, were minted in the new metal. Beginning in 1969, legislators sought to reintroduce <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> coin into commerce. After Eisenhower died in March of that year, {{there were a number}} of proposals to honor him with the new coin. While these bills generally commanded wide support, enactment was delayed by a dispute over whether the new coin should be in base metal or 40% silver. In 1970, a compromise was reached to strike the Eisenhower dollar in base metal for circulation, and in 40% silver as a collectible. President Richard Nixon, who had served as vice president under Eisenhower, signed legislation authorizing the new coin on December 31, 1970.|$|E

5|$|In his 1931 autobiography, {{the public}} {{relations}} pioneer Harry Reichenbach {{claimed responsibility for the}} controversy surrounding September Morn– and the work's resulting popularity. He stated that Braun and Company had acquired some 2,000 reproductions of the painting which they could not sell, and then hired him for $45 so that he could unload the stock. They then paid for a large lithograph reproduction to be made and put on display. Reichenbach, he stated, then contacted public figures to protest against the display. When there was no response, he accosted Comstock in his office and dragged him to the dealership, where some young children, whom Reichenbach had hired for fifty cents each, lusted over the display. The public relations man then worked towards maintaining interest in the work, prints of which had already increased in price– from 10 cents to <b>a</b> <b>dollar.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sherman and Hayes {{agreed to}} {{stockpile}} gold {{in preparation for}} the exchange of greenbacks for specie. The Act remained unpopular in some quarters, leading to four attempts to repeal it in the Senate and fourteen in the House—all unsuccessful. By this time, public confidence in the Treasury had grown to the extent that <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> in gold was worth only $1.05 in greenbacks. Once the public was confident that they could redeem greenbacks for gold, few actually did so; when the Act took effect in 1879, only $130,000 out of the $346,000,000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were redeemed. Greenbacks were now at parity with gold dollars, and the nation had, {{for the first time since}} the Civil War, a unified monetary system.|$|E
5|$|The United States trade dollar was <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> coin minted by the United States Mint {{to compete}} with other large silver trade coins that were already popular in East Asia. The idea first came about in the 1860s, {{when the price of}} silver began to decline due to {{increased}} mining efforts in the western United States. A bill providing in part for the issuance of the trade dollar was eventually put before Congress, where it was approved and later signed into law as the Coinage Act of 1873. The act made trade dollars legal tender up to five dollars. A number of designs were considered for the trade dollar, and an obverse and reverse created by William Barber were selected.|$|E

Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York World, started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000contributors, most of whom gave less than <b>a</b> <b>dollar.</b> The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} D-League, Clinkscales signed in 2013 with the Panama City Breeze of the semi-professional American Basketball League (ABL), with no {{indication}} that he joined any other team since his tenure with the BayHawks. On February 16, 2013, he scored 12 points with two three-pointers in a loss to the Emerald Coast Knights. While with the Breeze, Clinkscales (and his teammates) endured financial and domestic difficulties. He lived with five other teammates in a duplex house in Bay County, Florida. Because of financial issues, the league failed to pay the players—with Clinkscales solely receiving a check of $400—and canceled several games on its schedule. Later in the season, the players' duplex was supposedly leased by Breeze's head coach, Ty Fisher. A local broker filed a civil lawsuit against Fisher to evict the players, and county sheriff deputies soon forced them to leave the house. While living in the area, the players received aid from a local resident, Vonda Gainer, who they met at <b>a</b> <b>Dollar</b> Tree store. Gainer gave them food and washed their clothes. Despite their poor living conditions, the players failed to receive any aid by the league, with no contact or assurance from league CEO Steve Haney.|$|E

Murphy dropped out of school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton for <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> a day to help support his family; he also became skilled with a rifle, hunting small game to help feed them. After his mother died of endocarditis and pneumonia in 1941, he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store, garage and gas station in Greenville. Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Children's Home, a Christian orphanage in Quinlan.

5|$|As part {{of their}} Wizard research, the Air Force had {{developed}} a formula that compared {{the cost of an}} ICBM to the ABM needed to shoot it down. The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> figure; if the cost of the ICBM was less than that figure, the economic advantage was in favor of the offense - they could build more ICBMs for less money than the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated that it was almost always the case that the offense had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on Wizard, {{but as soon as the}} Army was handed sole control of the ABM efforts, they immediately submitted it to McElroy. McElroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting, but was concerned that the formula might be correct.|$|E

In addition to awards, Roddenberry also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame following a campaign by the fan clubs of Star Trek, which sought to have each fan donate <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> towards the overall $3500 cost of upkeep. Following these donations, the Committee {{in charge of the}} Walk of Fame voted Roddenberry in. The star was unveiled on September 4, 1985, at the 6600 block, near to the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Las Palmas. The induction ceremony was attended by all of the main cast of Star Trek, as well as Roger C. Carmel, who portrayed Harry Mudd in The Original Series. Following Roddenberry's death in 1991, he was posthumously awarded the Robert A. Heinlein Memorial Award by the National Space Society and The George Pal Memorial Award at the Saturn Awards. He was also awarded the Exceptional Public Service Medal by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).|$|E
5|$|In {{the remote}} Klondike, {{there was great}} demand for news and contact with the world outside. During {{the first months of}} the stampede in 1897, it was said that no news was too old to be read. In the lack of newspapers, some prospectors would read can labels until they knew them by heart. The {{following}} year, two teams fought their way over the passes to reach Dawson City first, complete with printing-presses, with the aim of gaining control of the newspaper market. Gene Kelly, the editor of the Klondike Nugget arrived first, but without his equipment, and it was the team behind the Midnight Sun who produced the first daily newspaper in Dawson. The Dawson Miner followed shortly after, bringing the number of daily newspapers in the town during the gold rush up to three. The Nugget sold for $24 ($680) as an annual subscription, and became well known for championing popular causes associated with miners and for its lucid coverage of scandals. Paper was often hard to find and during the winter of 1898–99, the Nugget had to be printed on butcher's wrapping paper. In the lack of paper, news could be told. In June, 1898, a prospector bought an edition of the Seattle Post-Intellinger at an auction and charged spectators <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> each to have it read aloud in one of Dawson's halls.|$|E
