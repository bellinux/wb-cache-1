40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the role of corporate offshoring strategy on offshoring decisions and performance. Based on 876 offshoring projects from 226 companies obtained by means of surveys conducted in the USA and Europe, we {{examine the effect of}} offshoring strategy on factors influencing firms' views of offshoring, and the effect of offshoring strategy on offshoring performance. Separate analyses were conducted for US and European companies in order to explore any regional heterogeneity in <b>offshoring.</b> <b>A</b> comparative analysis between companies with and without <b>an</b> <b>offshoring</b> strategy reveals that when making offshoring decisions, the former consider a broader range of factors (drivers, risks and locations) as important compared to companies without <b>an</b> <b>offshoring</b> strategy, suggesting association between offshoring strategy and managerial attention. The results also indicate that the adoption of <b>a</b> corporate <b>offshoring</b> strategy has <b>a</b> significant positive effect on cost savings achieved from offshore implementations, and that innovation activities have a significant negative impact on cost savings, but only for European companies.

5|$|The game's logo artwork {{was drawn}} by regular series artist Yoshitaka Amano. The kanji symbol {{used in the}} logo was drawn by Naora, who had {{designed}} the Shinra logo in Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. Naora specifically requested that he draw the logo due to this previous experience. To achieve the grittier atmosphere, Naora took a research trip to a Japanese military camp to learn what being a military cadet was like. The island of the Vermillion Perystilium was based on <b>an</b> <b>offshore</b> Japanese island he had visited prior to his involvement with the game, adding elements in-game such as <b>an</b> <b>offshore</b> ship wreck to symbolize his fear of the sea. He was also influenced by an incident where he saw a dead cat surrounded by other cats to portray the bond between members of Class Zero, and the game's themes, in promotional artwork.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{follows the}} {{diamonds}} to a pick-up by Bert Saxby, Whyte's head of security, and then onto a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where {{he finds that}} a satellite is being built by a laser refraction specialist, Professor Dr. Metz. Suspecting Whyte, Bond tries to confront him, but instead meets Blofeld, who captures the agent and explains {{to him that the}} satellite can blow up nuclear missiles. Blofeld admits that he intends to auction it to the highest bidder. Bond escapes and frees the captive Whyte and they establish that Blofeld is using <b>an</b> <b>offshore</b> oil rig as his base. Bond attacks the rig, stopping Blofeld's operation and dispersing his organisation.|$|E
40|$|Capability {{development}} {{can be defined}} as deliberate firm-level investment involving a search and learning process aimed at modifying or enhancing existing capabilities. Increasingly, firms are relocating advanced services to offshore locations resulting in the challenge of capability development in the offshore unit. Guided by the research question – what drives or impedes capability development in <b>an</b> <b>offshoring</b> context – the purpose of this thesis is to investigate how <b>an</b> idiosyncratic <b>offshoring</b> context affects capability development. The thesis consists of three papers using various datasets and qualitative methods that investigate capability development in <b>an</b> <b>offshoring</b> context. The first paper investigates how capability development takes place for a service-provider firm at the activity level. The second paper examines the transition made by <b>a</b> captive <b>offshore</b> unit, from performing standardized activities to R&D activities. The third paper examines capability development at the cluster level, and examines how spillovers from firms contribute to the emergence and evolution of clusters. Overall, this thesis argues that capability development is a path dependent process, and the offshoring context complicates the identification of capabilities lacking, the resources required to develop these capabilities and the alignment of supporting organizational processes. Captive offshore units and local service providers often perform back-office or standardized tasks that have been disaggregated from the value chain. In these cases, capability development presents a challenge, as firms need to take deliberate actions in order to develop capabilities, and identify the external linkages they must form to aid the capability development process...|$|R

5|$|On April 20, 2010, an {{explosion}} destroyed <b>an</b> <b>offshore</b> drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, {{and formed a}} bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review. As multiple efforts by BP failed, some {{in the media and}} public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Stormy weather {{can cause}} the sea level by the coast to rise by up to two metres. In the past, this has caused {{disastrous}} flooding in the town, {{the worst in the}} town's history being in 1953. Coastal defences were subsequently constructed including groynes, sea walls and shingle beach. In the 1990s, these defences were deemed to be inadequate and <b>an</b> <b>offshore</b> breakwater, now known as Neptune's Arm, was built to protect the most vulnerable areas of the town.|$|E
5|$|In South Korea, {{damage was}} {{heaviest}} in South Gyeongsang Province, where 71people were killed. Damage was particularly heavy in Busan, {{as well in}} as Yecheon, Ulsan, and Daegu. In Busan, strong winds wrecked 11lifting cranes, each weighing about 900tons, which injured five people and killed two in one incident. Many shipyards in the region were closed, and initial reports estimated {{it would take a}} year to fully reopen the Busan port. The estimated damage to the Busan port was about $50million (USD), causing cargo capacity to be cut by 20%. High waves turned a large ship on its side in Busan, and in Ulsan the waves knocked <b>an</b> <b>offshore</b> shipbuilding plant into a petroleum facility, damaging them both. Sixteen people were killed in Busan.|$|E
