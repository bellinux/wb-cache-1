The partition had gripped the Indian subcontinent with religious violence and the streets were filled with corpses. Some writers credit Gandhi's fasting and protests stopped the religious riots and communal violence. Others do not.

[...] The alleged haunting of the prison has been documented in numerous paranormal television series. Officials for Alcatraz have dismissed the reports of ghosts at Alcatraz as nonsense and deny their existence; an official for Alcatraz said in 1994, [...] "These ridiculous ghost stories will stop tourists from visiting. <b>And</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> these people say they heard canaries?

[...] Under Bemies' guidance, Geneva College became the first college in the United States to field a basketball team. [...] Interviewed in 2010, Ian Naismith, a basketball historian and the grandson of the sport's inventor, sought to settle disputing claims as to which college was the first to introduce basketball.

2500|$|Despite former {{guards and}} park rangers {{revealing}} their paranormal experiences at Alcatraz, officials for Alcatraz have publicly dismissed {{the reports of}} ghosts at Alcatraz as nonsense and deny their existence; an official for Alcatraz said in 1994, [...] "These ridiculous ghost stories will stop tourists from visiting. <b>And</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> these people say they heard canaries?

[...] Mary Forgione of the Los Angeles Times also stated that [...] "The National Park Service, which operates the island as a tourist site, pooh-poohs this, calling it Hollywood hype." [...] Alcatraz, run by the National Park Service, therefore does not operate an [...] "official ghost tour" [...] for tourists, but such tours, organized by independent parties, are permitted in the prison. Former prison guard Frank Healy, who served at Alcatraz {{as a young man}} from 1948 to 1951, has said that it was easy to gain a negative feeling at the prison {{at a time when it}} was all [...] "doom and gloom", although he said that if any place would have ghosts it would be Alcatraz. [...] Tracy Grant of The Washington Post, in discussing the book [...] "Ghost Hunt" [...] which documents the alleged haunting at Alcatraz, has said [...] "Authors Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson claim to be ghost hunters, and in this book they offer stories about the ghosts of inmates at Alcatraz prison and the idea that the ocean can be haunted. These stories are definitely scary, but don't take them too seriously. After all, ghosts aren't real. Are they?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Where is [...] learned? In life." [...] <b>And</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> earnestness be lost? How is it {{related to}} the resolution? Does [...] "love conquer everything?" [...] Kierkegaard thinks, [...] "a true {{conception}} of life and of oneself {{is required for the}} resolution of marriage; but this already implies the second great requirement, which is just like the first: a true conception of God. No one can have a true conception of God without having a corresponding conception of life and oneself, or a true conception of life without a corresponding conception of God, or a true conception of life without a corresponding conception of oneself. But a true conception of God is required; an understanding between God and the happy one is required, and thus a language is required in which they talk to each other. This language is the resolution, the only language in which God will involve himself with a human being." [...] He asks, [...] "Where does a person find guidance if he himself does not work out his own soul's salvation in fear and trembling"? He's writing about the wedding ceremony in this discourse just as he wrote about it in Either/Or and Repetition. Here he presents his own imaginative construction {{of the value of the}} single individual making a decision about marriage in the presence of God. Even though he never married he still knows that [...] "the adult learns only by appropriating and he essentially appropriates the essential only by doing it." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, Lucretius, {{describing}} atomism in his De rerum natura, gives {{very clear}} and compelling empirical arguments for the original atomist theory. He observes that any material is subject to irreversible decay. Through time, even hard rocks are slowly worn down by drops of water. Things have the tendency to get mixed up: Mix water with soil and mud will result, seldom disintegrating by itself. Wood decays. However, there are mechanisms in nature and technology to recreate [...] "pure" [...] materials like water, air, and metals. The seed of an oak will grow out into an oak tree, made of similar wood as historical oak trees, the wood of which has already decayed. The conclusion is that many properties of materials must derive from something inside, that will itself never decay, something that stores for eternity the same inherent, indivisible properties. The basic question is: Why has {{everything in the world}} not yet decayed, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> exactly some of the same materials, plants, and animals be recreated again and again? One obvious solution to explain how indivisible properties can be conveyed in a way not easily visible to human senses, is to hypothesize the existence of [...] "atoms". These classical [...] "atoms" [...] are nearer to humans' modern concept of [...] "molecule" [...] than to the atoms of modern science. The other central point of classical atomism is that there must be considerable open space between these [...] "atoms": the void. Lucretius gives reasonable arguments that the void is absolutely necessary to explain how gasses and liquids can flow and change shape, while metals can be molded without their basic material properties changing.|$|E
