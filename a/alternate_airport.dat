25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{arrived at}} Belfast City Airport at 07:15 {{after a short}} positioning flight from Belfast International Airport, and was refuelled for the planned route-trip to Cork and back. The flight specified Waterford Airport as the <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> for the sector to Cork. No second alternate was made. Boarding of the flight was delayed due to both crew members working on the passenger seats in the cabin; boarding commenced once that task was completed. Passengers chose their seats at random and the safety demonstration {{was carried out by}} the co-pilot.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} few months, the teams at TCA and Avro refined the requirements, which were signed off on 9 April 1946. They called for a 36-seat {{aircraft}} with a cruising speed of 425 miles per hour (684km/h), a range of 1,200 miles (1,900km), an average distance between stops of 250 miles (400km) and a longest single flight of 500 mi (800km). The difference between the range and maximum airport distances was {{to allow for the}} required 45 minutes stacking and diversion to a 120-mile (190-km)-distant <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> in a 20mph (30km/h) headwind. The aircraft also needed to be able to operate from existing 4,000ft (1,200m) runways. Load was 12,700lbs and 50 passengers.|$|E
500|$|At that point, First Officer Klotz radioed the controller, saying, [...] "ah well I {{think we}} need {{priority}} we're passing [...]" [...] The controller inquired as to how long the flight could hold {{as well as what}} their <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> was. Klotz replied at 20:46:03 that they could hold for five more minutes. The controller once again inquired as to their <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> and Klotz replied at 20:46:24, [...] "It was Boston but we can't do it now we, we, don't, we run out of fuel now." [...] A handoff controller listening in on the conversation called the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (NY TRACON) at 20:46:24 and advised the TRACON controller that Avianca Flight 52 could only hold for five more minutes. The handoff controller asked whether NY TRACON could take the flight or whether to send Avianca to its <b>alternate</b> <b>airport.</b> The NY TRACON controller replied, [...] "Slow him to one eight zero knots and I'll take him." [...] The handoff controller later testified that he had not heard Flight 52 say that they could no longer reach their <b>alternate</b> <b>airport.</b> At 20:46:47, the NY ARTCC radar controller cleared the flight to proceed to JFK at [...] and to slow to [...] Flight 52 departed the CAMRN holding pattern at 20:47.|$|E

50|$|Holding {{over the}} {{destination}} or <b>alternate</b> <b>airports</b> is a required {{part of some}} flight plans. Holding (circling in a pattern designated by the airport control tower) may be necessary if unexpected weather or congestion occurs at the airport. If the flight plan calls for hold planning, the additional fuel and hold time should appear on the flight plan.|$|R
500|$|Part of the {{subsequent}} NTSB investigation focused {{on the fact that}} the instrument approach at the destination airport was not legal for night landing, and the overall pressure applied on the charter company and flight crew by the charter customer to complete the flight into the original destination. According to witnesses, the charter customer, upon learning that the flight might have to be diverted to an <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> due to the night landing restriction, had his business assistant call Avjet management, to [...] "let them know that the airplane was not going to be redirected".|$|E
500|$|The NTSB {{investigators}} {{found that the}} weather data that the flight crew received in Medellín was nine to ten hours old. Additionally, the <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> on the flight plan, Logan International Airport in Boston, was forecast to be below the safe minima for landing. The NTSB also stated that the flight crew {{should have been more}} aware of these problems and cited these deficiencies as evidence of inadequacies in the dispatch of the airplane. The NTSB also found no evidence that the flight crew ever requested weather information en route or communicated with Avianca dispatchers about their fuel status and intents as other flights did. Flight 52 did not make contact with FAA flight service stations or flight watch en route, and the NTSB was unable to determine why. The flight did not express any concern to ATC about their fuel situation during the first two holding patterns that the flight made. The first indication of worry came at 20:09 when the flight crew inquired about delays at Boston. The NTSB posited that the flight crew might have become confused about the [...] "expect further clearance" [...] (EFC) times they were given. This confusion may have been the reason that the flight continued to hold, burning up its reserve fuel {{to the point where it}} could no longer divert to Boston.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "contributing factor" [...] to the {{accident}} was a long discussion with the Protocol director and {{the crew of the}} Yak-40 regarding the actual weather and the impossibility of landing at Smolensk in such weather conditions. The report found this discussion caused the Captain to experience [...] "clash of motives." [...] On one hand he knew that landing in the reported weather conditions was unsafe. On the other hand, he faced strong motivation to land at Smolensk anyway. He expected a strong negative reaction from the President if he chose to divert the airplane and land at an <b>alternate</b> <b>airport.</b>|$|E
50|$|Part {{of flight}} {{planning}} often involves {{the identification of}} one or more airports which can be flown to in case of unexpected conditions (such as weather) at the destination airport. The planning process must be careful to include only <b>alternate</b> <b>airports</b> which can be reached with the anticipated fuel load and total aircraft weight and that have capabilities necessary to handle the type of aircraft being flown.|$|R
50|$|Every airport {{approached}} by aircraft without landing gear must operate {{at least one}} ground carriage. In addition, <b>alternate</b> <b>airports</b> must be available if an airport is closed due to bad weather or a system failure. For emergency landings outside of runways, unsuitable flooring or unpaved ground cannot absorb the high wheel loads. Therefore, the landing gear of heavy long-haul aircraft in emergency landing on unsuitable ground is often not extended, since it would otherwise sink into ground first and then bend or break off.|$|R
50|$|Currently, {{the setup}} {{of a small}} scale {{demonstrator}} is envisioned, the full scale system is planned {{to be ready for}} market entry in 2035. The focus of the GroLaS study starts with long-haul cargo aircraft. In a first implementation of the system, the world's major cargo <b>airports</b> and corresponding <b>alternate</b> <b>airports</b> have to be equipped. The costs for an airport are expected to be 500 million euros. GroLaS is patented in Europe, the USA and China. A model in 1:87 scale, which was built in 2013, was exhibited at the Berlin Air Show in 2014.|$|R
2500|$|The MAK {{report found}} the [...] "immediate cause" [...] of the {{accident}} was {{the failure of the}} crew to make a timely decision to proceed to an <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> despite being warned multiple times of the poor weather conditions at Smolensk. Another immediate cause was the descent below minimums without visual contact with the ground as well as ignoring numerous TAWS warnings. This led to controlled flight into terrain. Additionally, the MAK report found an [...] "immediate cause" [...] {{of the accident}} was the presence in the cockpit of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Air Force, which placed extreme stress and [...] "psychological pressure" [...] on the Captain to [...] "continue descent in conditions of unjustified risk with a dominating aim of landing at any means." ...|$|E
50|$|Except {{for some}} US {{domestic}} flights, a flight plan normally has an <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> {{as well as}} a destination airport. The <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> is for use in case the destination airport becomes unusable while the flight is in progress (due to weather conditions, a strike, a crash, terrorist activity, etc.). This means that when the aircraft gets near the destination airport, it must still have enough alternate fuel and alternate reserve available to fly on to the <b>alternate</b> <b>airport.</b> Since the aircraft is not expected at the <b>alternate</b> <b>airport,</b> it must also have enough holding fuel to circle for a while (typically 30 minutes) near the <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> while a landing slot is found. United States domestic flights are not required to have sufficient fuel to proceed to an <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> when the weather at the destination is forecast to be better than 2000 ft ceilings and 3 statute miles of visibility; however, the 45-minute reserve at normal cruising speed still applies.|$|E
5000|$|US {{domestic}} operations conducted under Instrument Flight Rules: enough fuel {{to fly to}} the first point of intended landing, then fly to an <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> (if weather conditions require an <b>alternate</b> <b>airport),</b> then for 45 minutes thereafter at normal cruising speed ...|$|E

50|$|In {{response}} to the attacks on September 11, 2001, the FAA orders all planes out of the air. American and Canadian air traffic controllers face a difficult situation: how to safely re-route and land 4,000+ planes carrying close to a million people. For individual air traffic controllers, the work is chaotic, intense, and deceptively simple: pick a new route for each flight; radio instructions to turn; listen for pilot confirmation; hold traffic to keep airways from overcrowding. From Cleveland, Ohio to Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador, controllers on September 11 searched for <b>alternate</b> <b>airports</b> to land large jets as their traumatized colleagues return from breaktime having watched the attacks on TV.|$|R
50|$|The {{other factor}} {{which is also}} helpful is the {{positioning}} of the initial <b>alternate</b> <b>airport.</b>|$|E

The crew decided to divert to their <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> at Kangel Danda. The airplane touched down on its nose gear first and suffered some minor damage to the nose section.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, {{unlike the}} United States, unless {{specifically}} exempted {{by a company}} Operating Certificate, IFR flight plans require an <b>alternate</b> <b>airport,</b> regardless of the forecast destination weather. In order to {{be considered as a}} legally valid alternate, the airport must be forecast to be at or above certain weather minima at the estimated time of arrival (at the alternate). The minimum weather conditions vary based on the type of approach(es) available at the <b>alternate</b> <b>airport,</b> and may be found in the General section of the Canada Air Pilot (CAP).|$|E
25|$|Although a safe {{landing at}} Campbeltown was in doubt, {{the pilot was}} {{authorised}} to make an approach. Weather at his two designated <b>alternate</b> landing <b>airports</b> (Glasgow and Prestwick) was good in case the plane needed to divert.|$|R
50|$|The Hamilton International <b>Airport</b> is an <b>alternate,</b> relief <b>airport</b> to Pearson, {{but not in}} the GTA. Situated in Hamilton, 85 km {{southwest}} of Toronto, it is also a terminus for low-cost carrier, charter airline, and courier traffic.|$|R
50|$|Air {{navigation}} systems {{usually have}} a moving map display and are often connected to the autopilot for en-route navigation. Cockpit-mounted GNSS receivers and glass cockpits are appearing in general aviation aircraft of all sizes, using technologies such as WAAS or LAAS to increase accuracy.

Glider pilots use GNSS Flight Recorders to log GNSS data verifying their arrival at turn points in gliding competitions. Flight computers installed in many gliders also use GNSS to compute wind speed aloft, and glide paths to waypoints such as <b>alternate</b> <b>airports</b> or mountain passes, to aid en route decision making for cross-country soaring.|$|R

50|$|The airport has {{suffered}} {{from a lack of}} capacity due to restrictions on expansion, since it is located in a densely populated area. In 2014, Mexican authorities established and declared a maximum capacity of 61 operations per hour with a total of 16 rush hours (7:00 -22:59). Another issue with the airport is the limitation that its two runways provide, since they are used at 97.3% of their maximum capacity, leaving a very short room for new operations into the airport. Only government, military, commercial, and specially authorized aircraft are allowed to land at the airport. Private aircraft must use <b>alternate</b> <b>airports,</b> such as Lic. Adolfo López Mateos International Airport in Toluca, General Mariano Matamoros Airport in Cuernavaca, or Hermanos Serdán International Airport in Puebla.|$|R
2500|$|On February 21, 2007 Flight 172, an Adam Air Boeing 737-300 {{aircraft}} {{flying from}} Jakarta to Surabaya with registration PK-KKV (c/n 27284), {{had a hard}} landing at Juanda International Airport. The incident caused the fuselage of the plane to crack and bend at the middle, with {{the tail of the}} plane drooping towards the ground. There were no reports of serious injuries from the incident. Subsequent flights to the airport were diverted to <b>alternate</b> <b>airports.</b> As a result, six Adam Air 737s were grounded awaiting safety checks, but five of these were then put back in regular service. Adam Air described this as [...] "harsh punishment" [...] for an accident it blamed on poor weather conditions, but Vice President Jusuf Kalla has said that all Boeing 737-300s should be checked.|$|R
500|$|The plane bent upon {{landing at}} Juanda International Airport, with the {{fuselage}} breaking {{in the middle}} of the passenger section. The landing was particularly hard, with baggage being ejected from cabin lockers into the cabin space. The tail section of the plane was bent down compared to the rest of the plane. Subsequent flights to the airport were diverted to <b>alternate</b> <b>airports.</b> Adam Air's fleet of Boeing 737-300s were grounded for safety inspections in the interim. Immediately after the accident, Adam Air repainted the aircraft, covering the original orange livery with a plain white exterior. This is legally permissible, so long as no evidence is destroyed. Also in the immediate aftermath, a large number of passengers cancelled their flights with Adam Air, saying they had [...] "lost faith" [...] in the airline. They were all refunded in full.|$|R
