5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of Antony at the Battle of Actium in 31BC, Octavian {{consolidated}} his political power and in 27BC was named Augustus by the Roman Senate, becoming the first Roman emperor. Around this time, Tiridates II of Parthia briefly overthrew Phraates IV, {{who was able to}} quickly reestablish his rule with the aid of Scythian nomads. Tiridates fled to the Romans, taking one of Phraates' sons with him. In negotiations conducted in 20BC, Phraates arranged for the release of his kidnapped son. In return, the Romans received the lost legionary standards taken at Carrhae in 53BC, as well as any surviving prisoners of war. The Parthians viewed this exchange as <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> to regain the prince. Augustus hailed the return of the standards as a political victory over Parthia; this propaganda was celebrated in the minting of new coins, the building of a new temple to house the standards, and even in fine art such as the breastplate scene on his statue Augustus of Prima Porta.|$|E

25|$|Both of the lovers' fates are {{interwoven}} {{yet they}} deceive {{the other in}} a fight for dominance that Cleopatra wins for a while as the audience and other characters throughout the play know completely {{what is going on in}} the play filled with dramatic irony. Enobarbus once again knows of Antony's unrelenting attachment to Cleopatra and Cleopatra's mind games while the audience knows Cleopatra isn't dead as Antony kills himself over her. They both spent their whole lives trying to achieve higher fame than the other and became notorious for their lust. They are their own Gods and live separate from those that they call normal and watch. The play progresses into the protagonists decline in fame, leaving them to pursue a sure way into that immortality they coveted. They become immortals in death along with even more fame and has as well achieved their goal from the beginning. They die in the name of their love when they really die in the name of fame. A status of nobility higher than us and pity for the tragedy that is their relationship. The tragedy is Antony and Cleopatra's own happy ending as death was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> to become real gods. They proved that the only death that could touch them were by their own hand, further increasing that godly power they received from the people. Now they are apart from those they watched, now they are above them, and now they will be worshipped as gods.|$|E

As I have just said, its main mistake, in its early stages, was the unwholesome demand for perfection, at any cost. I hope enough has been advanced, in the chapter on the Nature of Gothic, to show the reader that perfection is not to be had from the general workman, but at the cost of everything,--of his whole life, thought, and energy. And Renaissance Europe thought this <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for manipulative perfection. Men like Verrocchio and Ghiberti were not to be had every day, nor in every place; and to require from the common workman execution or knowledge like theirs, was to require him to become their copyist. Their strength was great enough to enable them to join science with invention, method with emotion, finish with fire; but, in them, the invention and the fire were first, while Europe saw in them only the method and the finish. This was new to the minds of men, and they pursued it to the neglect of everything else. [...] "This," [...] they cried, [...] "we must have in all our work henceforward:" [...] and they were obeyed. The lower workman secured method and finish, and lost, in exchange for them, his soul.|$|E
50|$|In England the Conservation Foundation {{has begun}} propagating, distributing and {{planting}} clones of surviving indigenous elms, including field elms (but not the highly susceptible English elm), {{as part of}} a scheme to return elms to city and countryside.

5000|$|However, {{the band}} {{continued}} {{to struggle to}} gain recognition, {{partly due to the}} preference of heavy metal over techno in their hometown, according to singer Jenny. In 1991 they responded to a newspaper ad by producer John Ballard, who was looking for new talent. He was somewhat unsure about their potential, but did pass them on to Klas Lunding at Telegram Records, who helped them record an early demo for the song [...] "Wheel of Fortune" [...] in their newly renovated studio. A Jamaican reggae band resided in a studio next door to theirs, leading to a collaboration of ideas. This resulted in a fusion of reggae with pop which became the band's trademark sound. [...] "Wheel of Fortune" [...] did not convince Telegram to sign the band, and other labels in Sweden still showed no sign of interest. The demo was eventually sold for <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> the independent Danish label Mega Records in March 1992. [...] "Wheel of Fortune" [...] was re-recorded and released as a single in Denmark in May, but it failed to chart.

60|$|Well, the {{breaking}} of a collar-bone is <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the saving of such a match as that. So thought Tom Dimsdale as he made for the pavilion, with his father keeping off the exultant crowd upon one side and Jack Garraway upon the other. The doctor butted {{a path through the}} dense half-crazy mob with a vigour which showed that his son's talents in that direction were hereditary. Within half an hour Tom was safely ensconced {{in the corner of the}} carriage, with his shoulder braced back, secundum artem, and his arm supported by a sling. How quietly and deftly the two women slipped a shawl here and a rug there to save him from the jarring of the carriage! It is part of the angel nature of woman that when youth and strength are maimed and helpless they appeal to her more than they can ever do in the pride and flush of their power. Here lies the compensation of the unfortunate. Kate's dark blue eyes filled with ineffable compassion as she bent over him; and he, catching sight of that expression, felt a sudden new unaccountable spring of joy bubble up in his heart, which made all previous hopes and pleasures seem vapid and meaningless. The little god shoots hard and straight when his mark is still in the golden dawn of life. All the way back he lay with his head among the cushions, dreaming of ministering angels, his whole soul steeped in quiet contentment as it dwelt upon the sweet earnest eyes which had looked so tenderly into his. It had been an eventful day with the student. He had saved his side, he had broken his collar-bone, and now, most serious of all, he had realized that he was hopelessly in love.|$|E

How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; {{his mind is}} so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence. He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One man's life or death were but <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener's countenance. At first I perceived {{that he tried to}} suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: [...] "Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!" ...|$|E

60|$|Previous to this lady's {{execution}} {{there would}} {{appear to have been}} but few prosecuted to death on the score of witchcraft, although the want of the justiciary records of that period leaves us in uncertainty. But in the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries, when such charges grew general over Europe, cases of the kind occurred very often in Scotland, and, as we have already noticed, were sometimes of a peculiar character. There is, indeed, a certain monotony in most tales of the kind. The vassals are usually induced to sell themselves at <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> the Author of Ill, who, having commonly to do with women, drives a very hard bargain. On the contrary, when he was pleased to enact the female on a similar occasion, he brought his gallant, one William Barton, a fortune of no less than fifteen pounds, which, even supposing it to have been the Scottish denomination of coin, was a very liberal endowment compared with his niggardly conduct towards the fair sex on such an occasion. Neither did he pass false coin on this occasion, but, on the contrary, generously gave Burton a merk, to keep the fifteen pounds whole. In observing on Satan's conduct in this matter, Master George Sinclair observes that it is fortunate the Enemy is but seldom permitted to bribe so high (as £15 Scots); for were this the case, he might find few men or women capable of resisting his munificence. I look upon this {{as one of the most}} severe reflections on our forefathers' poverty which is extant.|$|R

After correcting for factors previously found to explain changes in two indicators of investor interest, analyst attention and institutional ownership, we find that firms with listed options exhibit significantly higher average levels of each of these variables than firms without listed options. Prior results regarding this issue are limited and contradictory.

5000|$|The vast {{majority}} of the reading public could not afford to own a private library, and while most of the state-run [...] "universal libraries" [...] set up in the 17th and 18th centuries were open to the public, they were not the only sources of reading material. On one end of the spectrum was the Bibliothèque Bleue, a collection of cheaply produced books published in Troyes, France. Intended for a largely rural and semi-literate audience these books included almanacs, retellings of medieval romances and condensed versions of popular novels, among other things. While some historians have argued against the Enlightenment's penetration into the lower classes, the Bibliothèque Bleue represents at least a desire to participate in Enlightenment sociability. Moving up the classes, a variety of institutions offered readers access to material without needing to buy anything. Libraries that lent out their material for <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>price</b> started <b>to</b> appear, and occasionally bookstores would offer <b>a</b> <b>small</b> lending library to their patrons. Coffee houses commonly offered books, journals and sometimes even popular novels to their customers.

This {{is an example of the}} triple or even quadruple function of the coffee house: reading material was often obtained, read, discussed and even produced on the premises.|$|R
