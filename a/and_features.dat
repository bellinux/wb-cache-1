40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel method for the {{simultaneous}} localization and mapping(SLAM) problem with two cameras. A single camera based approach {{suffers from a}} lack of information for <b>feature</b> initialization <b>and</b> the instability of covariance of the 3 D camera location <b>and</b> <b>feature</b> position. To solve this problem, we use two cameras which move independently, unlike the stereo camera. We derive new formulations for the extended Kalman filter and map management of two cameras. We also present a method for the new <b>features</b> initialization <b>and</b> <b>feature</b> matching with two cameras. In our method, the covariance of camera <b>and</b> <b>feature</b> location converges more rapidly. This characteristic enables a reduction of the computational complexity by fixing the feature position whose covariance converges. Experimental results prove that our approach estimates the 3 D camera location <b>and</b> <b>feature</b> position more accurately and the covariance of camera <b>and</b> <b>feature</b> location converges more rapidly when compared with the single camera case.
