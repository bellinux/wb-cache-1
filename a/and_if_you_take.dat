5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E
500|$|In a 1996 interview, Deal {{said that}} for Pacer, she focused on the vocals: [...] "Usually, I tend {{to spend more time}} with the instruments. Last Splash had quite a few instrumentals and quite a few songs where I might say five words. [...] songs are all vocal-heavy. The vocal leads, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> the vocal away, you don't have much of a song." [...] The sound of the album has been {{described}} as [...] "lo-fi".|$|E
500|$|In Round the Horne, as well {{as acting}} as link man, Horne also played other {{character}} roles in the film and melodrama spoofs, but always sounded exactly like Kenneth Horne. Referring to his ability with voices, he commented that [...] "between them Betty, Ken W., Hugh and Bill Pertwee can provide at least 100 voices, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> me into account the figure leaps to 101." [...] Williams reported that Horne had a card index mind, [...] "in which {{there seemed to be}} stored every funny voice, every dialect, every comedy trick, which he knew that each member of the cast was capable of", and would suggest a change in approach if a line did not work during rehearsals.|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{will fill}} your purse rarely, Guy. But let us {{hear more of}} this fighting. De Valles's ship {{must have been a}} great one, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> it with but your own sixty men {{it must have been a}} {{brilliant}} action." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{only thing}} for you to do, so far as I can see," [...] said the girl, slowly, [...] "is to make {{yourself}} up like a coalie. There are one or two colliers in the harbor, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> off your coat--I could send it on afterwards--rubbed yourself all over with coal-dust, and shaved off your moustache, I believe you would escape." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the South Park episode [...] "Trapped in the Closet", a satire of Scientology which {{aired on}} November 16, 2005, Hayes {{did not appear}} {{in his role as}} Chef. While {{appearing}} on the Opie and Anthony radio show about a month after the episode aired, Hayes was asked, [...] "What did you think about when Matt and Trey did that episode on Scientology?", he replied, [...] "One thing about Matt and Trey, they lampoon everybody, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> that [...] serious, I'll sell you the Brooklyn Bridge for two dollars. [...] That's what they do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Felps, {{we are not}} young rascals," [...] said Shep, with {{flashing}} eyes. [...] "We {{shot the}} deer in good faith <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> it from us I shall consider it stealing." ...|$|E
60|$|Man. I've {{lost all}} {{privilege}} to defend my life; <b>And,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> it now, 'tis no new conquest; Like fish, first {{taken in a}} river, then Bestowed in ponds to catch a second time.|$|E
60|$|I {{would not}} have you either stay or go; For <b>if</b> <b>you</b> stay you steal my love from me, <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> go <b>you</b> <b>take</b> my love away. Guido, though all the morning stars could sing They could not tell the measure of my love. I love you, Guido.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, you {{had better}} begin to-night, O'Grady. I am {{going to get away}} as soon as I can, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>take</b> my advice <b>you</b> will come too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never took}} a false name, and I've never yet told a lie to a woman. What lie? Why, the lie--. Take me or leave me, I say: <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> me, then it is..." [...] He hummed a snatch very low, {{leaning against the}} wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Flint, [...] "perhaps I am. But I believe you'll find he {{left for}} the capital on the eleven o'clock, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> the trouble to inquire from Bedding you will {{probably}} learn that the Throne Room is bespoken for the session." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'To {{bring you}} two gifts {{which he has}} just {{received}} from the country of the Moors,' answered Peronnik: 'the apple of delight and the woman of submission. If you eat the apple you will not desire anything else, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> the woman as your servant you will never wish for another.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Watch never hurted any {{creature}} yet," [...] said Bawcombe. He caught {{things just}} {{for his own}} amusement, but never injured them--he always let them go again. He would hunt mice in the fields, and when he captured one he would play with it like a cat, tossing it from him, then dashing after and recapturing it. Finally, he would let it go. He played with rabbits in the same way, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> a rabbit from him and examined it you would find it quite uninjured.|$|R
6000|$|If ever my St. George's schools come to any perfection, {{they shall}} have every one a jackdaw {{to give the}} {{children}} their first lessons in arithmetic. I'm sure {{he could do it}} perfectly. [...] "Now, Jack, take two from four, and show them how many are left." [...] "Now, Jack, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> the teaspoon out of this saucer, and put it into that, <b>and</b> then <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> two teaspoons out of two saucers, and put them into this, <b>and</b> then <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> one teaspoon out of this, and put it into that, how many spoons are there in this, and how many in that?"--and so on.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Good heavens! Lady Clem,' cried Lord Arthur, {{catching}} {{hold of her}} hand, 'you mustn't {{do anything}} of the kind. It is a homoeopathic medicine, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> it without having heartburn, it might do you no end of harm. Wait till you have an attack, and take it then. You will be astonished at the result.' ...|$|E
60|$|Harry. Why, the {{lie that}} comes glib to a man's tongue. None {{of that for}} me. I leave the sneaking off to them soft-spoken chaps you're {{thinking}} of. No!

6000|$|... "Adams," [...] he replied, {{glaring at}} me through his smoked spectacles, [...] "If you talk like that we shall quarrel. Maqueda change her mind indeed! Why, it {{is an insult to}} suggest such a thing, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> my advice you won't let Oliver hear you. Don't you remember, man, that she's in love with him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] {{the major}} said, [...] "that would suit us exactly. I shall drive in my dog-cart, which will carry four of us; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>take</b> Dick, {{that will make}} it all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] said he; [...] "we're messmates now, Master Pongo. Andy Battle's had a {{taste of}} slavery himself, and it isn't reasonable, my son. It frets in like rusty iron, my son; and Andy's supped his fill of it. I takes to your company wonnerful well, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>takes</b> to mine, then that's plain-sailing, says I. But <b>if</b> them apes <b>and</b> monkeys over yonder are more to your liking than a shipwrecked sailor, who's to blame ye? Every man to his own, says I; {{breeches}} to breeches, and bare to bare.

6000|$|... "That's what I said, {{a message}} from Old Mother Nature, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>take</b> my advice <b>you</b> will heed it," [...] {{retorted}} Chatterer. [...] "She says you are to come to school {{with the rest of}} us at sun-up to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope we are {{not very}} savage," [...] he said, smiling; [...] "but, indeed, I still say it is the safest rule. It {{would be the only}} one if you were really among unkind people; <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> so much to heart an unlucky neglect of mine, {{what would you do if}} the slight were a true one?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{is called}} [...] "Gunnfjoder," [...] the [...] "Battle Plume,"' {{answered}} Helga, 'and [...] "Gullfaxi" [...] means [...] "Golden Mane."

60|$|Lor. Nay, if {{you talk}} of {{consider}}ing, let us consider why we are alone. Do you think the friar left us together to tell beads? Love {{is a kind of}} penurious god, very niggardly of his opportunities: he must be watched like a hard-hearted treasurer; for he bolts out on the sudden, <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> him not in the nick, he vanishes in a twinkling.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You shall give {{nothing at}} all,' said Miss Maylie, smiling; 'for, as I told you before, we shall employ {{you in a}} hundred ways; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> only <b>take</b> half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will make me very happy indeed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{do nothing}} of the sort. It's yours, to do with as <b>you</b> please, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> won't <b>take</b> it, I'll give it to Maria. She'll {{know what to do}} with it. I'd suggest, though, that you hire a servant and take a good long rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|William banished him for life; {{but just}} before he departed, {{he came to the}} King, saying, [...] "I know not when I shall see <b>you</b> again, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>take</b> it, I would fain give you my blessing--the blessing of a father to his son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Roger, if {{you will}} take my advice you will make your ship your mistress. She will have her ways, but you will learn them, and will know just how much helm she requires, and how the sail should be trimmed; but with a woman no man attains to this knowledge, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> my advice, you will give them a wide berth.|$|E
6000|$|... "So far as I {{can make}} it out, this {{is a recipe for}} Loss of Weight. ("Ah!" [...] said Pyecraft.) I'm not {{absolutely}} sure, but I think it's that. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> my advice you'll leave it alone.

6000|$|... "Risk! {{and what}} is the mighty risk, I pray you?" [...] {{answered}} Varney. [...] "This fellow will come prowling again about your demesne or into your house, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> him for a house-breaker or a park-breaker, is it not most natural you should welcome him with cold steel or hot lead?
