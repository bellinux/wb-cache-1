Lobengula {{had so far}} accepted the financial payments described in the Rudd Concession (and continued {{to do so for}} years afterwards), but when the guns arrived in early April, he refused to take them. Jameson placed the weapons under a canvas cover in Maguire's camp, stayed at the kraal for ten days, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> south with Maguire in tow, leaving the rifles behind. A few weeks later, Lobengula dictated a letter for Fairbairn to write to the Queen—he said he had never intended to sign away mineral rights and that he and his izinDuna revoked their recognition of the document.|$|E

Initially scheduled for a single performance, the show was so popular that the troupe repeated it for another ten Sundays.|$|E

Phillips claimed the event happened one afternoon when he was home alone, Maddie came to his house asking him to come outside and play baseball, Phillips agreed even though he was not allowed to have friends over while his parents were not home. As the two were playing baseball, Maddie threw the ball at him and he hit it, which caused the ball to strike the 8-year-old's eye, causing her to bleed, leading Clifton to cry and scream. Phillips panicked, fearing the reaction that his father would give when he got home and saw the aftermath. Phillips proceeded to drag Clifton into his home and then into his room and strangle her with a phone cord for approximately 15 minutes. Soon after, he hit her again with the baseball bat and stashed her under his bed, not long after Josh's father entered the house, Phillips went to interact with his father for a short moment <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to his room and found that Clifton was still alive moaning under his bed, he took off the mattress and stabbed her 11 times, killing the 8-year-old.|$|E
500|$|By February 1969, Redding {{had grown}} weary of Hendrix's {{unpredictable}} {{work ethic and}} his creative control over the Experience's music. During the previous month's European tour, interpersonal relations within the group had deteriorated, particularly between Hendrix and Redding. In his diary, Redding documented the building frustration during early 1969 recording sessions: [...] "On the first day, as I nearly expected, there was nothing doing... On the second it was no show at all. I went to the pub for three hours, came back, {{and it was still}} ages before Jimi ambled in. Then we argued... On the last day, I just watched it happen for a while, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to my flat." [...] The last Experience sessions that included Redding—a re-recording of [...] "Stone Free" [...] for use as a possible single release—took place on April 14 at Olmstead and the Record Plant in New York. Hendrix then flew bassist Billy Cox to New York; they started recording and rehearsing together on April 21.|$|E
500|$|Tomb Raider III was {{originally}} released for the Microsoft Windows and PlayStation platforms on 20 November 1998, and immediately topped the UK games charts. Upon release, some minor bugs {{in the game}} were detected, the most significant of which prevented players from completing the Temple Ruins level if they saved the game in a specific area <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to that area. Although the bugs in the Microsoft Windows version were addressed {{with the release of}} a patch, the bugs in the PlayStation discs remained. To prevent further issues, Core Design quickly burned new gold discs with an updated version of the game. The game was ported to Mac OS computers in 1999. An expansion pack called Tomb Raider III: The Lost Artefact was released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS computers in March 2000. The expansion includes six levels set in several European locations, where Lara must learn of the existence of a fifth meteorite piece called the Hand of Rathmore.

While continuing the recording sessions on the album, he began working with rapper and record producer Kanye West on a song, where Kanye did the chorus.

The Game also {{was working on the}} album for his inspiration goals about reviving {{what it felt like to}} be involved in this whole hip hop scene in the West Coast, which was overshadowed over these past few years by these artists between the East to the South. In 2005, in the interview with Vibe magazine, 50 Cent stated that he was brought in by the Interscope Records to work on the album, claiming that was on the verge of being shelved and The Game was being dropped from the label. However, in the interview with Funkmaster Flex, The Game said that his status was never uncertain that he would be dropped from the label. 50 Cent also claimed that he wrote six songs of The Documentarys eighteen tracks—"Hate It or Love It", [...] "How We Do", [...] "Church for Thugs", [...] "Special", [...] "Higher", and [...] "Westside Story"—and didn't receiving any proper credit for his work. The Game denied those claims, saying that 50 Cent only wrote two songs on the album.|$|E

The Xbox version was also awarded the October [...] "Xbox Game of the Month" [...] award. Roper dismissed notions that the game was simply a Grand Theft Auto clone, arguing instead that it advanced the genre; [...] "much of Scarface is based on what we've seen in Grand Theft Auto. In fact, it's fairly obvious that Radical used said series as the blueprint <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> and re-evaluated its shortcomings. The result {{is that we have}} a game that fixes many of GTAs problematic elements." [...] He praised the basic gameplay, the storyline, the balls meter, rage mode, and the aiming system. Although he was somewhat critical of the map, arguing too many areas in the game are accessible via only one road, he concluded [...] "there are a whole lot of little things about Scarface that make it fun, but it's the sum of its parts that make it the overall great game that it is. It does a whole lot to fix many of the problems with other games in the genre, and it does an absolutely fantastic job of bringing the world of Scarface to gamers." [...] Mark Bozon and Chris Roper scored the Wii version 8.5 out of 10, also giving it an [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] award, and writing [...] "Scarface is a very impressive game, and while there isn't a ton of Wii-specific additions to the package, everything that was added makes a big difference." [...] Praising the controls, they wrote [...] "it's amazingly easy to target enemies and blow off specific body parts in the process." [...] They called it [...] "an intelligent, high-budget, astonishingly impressive game," [...] arguing [...] "Wii owners that fit in the hardcore crowd will absolutely eat this one up, as it's currently one of the deepest and most entertaining experiences on the system." ...|$|E
