5|$|A common {{source of}} data for {{archaeoastronomy}} {{is the study of}} alignments. This {{is based on the assumption}} that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} {{of carbon dioxide}} on the surface suggests that Titania may have a tenuous seasonal atmosphere of CO2, much {{like that of the}} Jovian moon Callisto. Other gases, like nitrogen or methane, <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> present, because Titania's weak gravity could not prevent them from escaping into space. At the maximum temperature attainable during Titania's summer solstice (89 K), the vapor pressure of carbon dioxide is about 300 μPa (3 nbar).|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{classified}} as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List (v3.1, 2007). Species are listed as such due to their wide distribution, presumed large population, or because they <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. When last assessed in 2007, the population trend was stable.|$|E

5|$|At the {{opposite}} end, at Ysgwrfa, the final five locks before Glynneath have been severed by a realignment {{of the road}} and the construction of a culvert, but the road has carried a lot less traffic since the A465 bypass was opened, and could possibly be rerouted along its original course, where the bridge over the canal still exists. The Neath Canal Act has not been repealed, and so there is still a right of navigation along this section, which should ease the process of reinstating it. The terminus would then be near the Lamb and Flag public house, south of the final two locks, which <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> restored.|$|E
5|$|Genotyping arrays {{designed}} for GWAS rely on linkage disequilibrium to provide {{coverage of the}} entire genome by genotyping a subset of variants. Because of this, the reported associated variants <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the actual causal variants. Associated regions can contain hundreds of variants spanning large regions and encompassing many different genes, making the biological interpretation of GWAS loci more difficult. Fine-mapping is a process to refine these lists of associated variants to a credible set most likely to include the causal variant.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, the Glover's pika {{is rated}} {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is {{because it is a}} {{widespread}} species, and it occurs in remote areas of China which <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affected by human activities. The current state of its population trend is unclear, as no natural historic or ecological investigation has been done on this species. However, being locally poisoned and trapped is a major threat to the Glover's pika populations. It is also regionally red listed as a species of least concern in China.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that smaller-sized P. rebeli from Hungary {{normally}} eclose {{at the end of}} June or mid-July; however, when these populations are studied in laboratories, they do not eclose until late August. This has led researchers to speculate that P. rebeli larvae that do not receive adequate food can still fully develop in one year and act as a functioning adult. However, they <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bivoltine (producing two broods in one season). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that certain researchers claim that P. rebeli larvae can have continuous development.|$|E
5|$|The wind-wind {{collision}} cone {{separates the}} winds of the two stars. For 55–75° behind the secondary, there is a thin hot wind typical of O or Wolf–Rayet stars. This allows some radiation from Eta Carinae B to be detected and its temperature can be estimated with some accuracy due to spectral lines that <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> produced by any other source. Although the secondary star has never been directly observed, there is widespread agreement on models where it has a temperature between 37,000K and 41,000K.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} theories concerning when the text was completed and concerning {{the identity of}} the author or authors, but archeological recoveries show The Art of War had taken roughly its current form by at least the early Han. Because it is impossible to prove definitively when the Art of War was completed before this date, the differing theories concerning the work's author or authors and date of completion <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> completely resolved. Some modern scholars believe that it contains not only the thoughts of its original author but also commentary and clarifications from later military theorists, such as Li Quan and Du Mu.|$|E

5|$|Whitetip reef sharks hunt {{primarily}} at night, when many fishes are asleep and easily taken. After dusk, groups of sharks methodically scour the reef, often breaking off pieces of coral in their vigorous pursuit of prey. Multiple sharks may target the same prey item, covering every exit route {{from a particular}} coral head. Each shark hunts for itself and in competition with the others in its group. Unlike blacktip reef sharks and grey reef sharks, whitetip reef sharks do not become more excited when feeding in groups and <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stirred into a feeding frenzy. Despite their nocturnal habits, whitetip reef sharks will hunt opportunistically in daytime. Off Borneo, this species gathers around reef drop-offs to feed on food brought up by the rising current. Off Hawaii, they follow Hawaiian monk seals (Monachus schauinslandi) and attempt to steal their catches. A whitetip reef shark can survive for six weeks without food.|$|E
5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that tolerance to therapeutic effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. Tolerance develops to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD therapeutic effects disappear with tolerance, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. Several studies {{have confirmed that}} long-term benzodiazepines are {{not significantly different from}} placebo for sleep or anxiety. This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because tolerance to benzodiazepine sedating effects develops more quickly than does tolerance to brainstem depressant effects, those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden respiratory depression, hypotension or death. Most patients with anxiety disorders and PTSD have symptoms that persist for at least several months, making tolerance to therapeutic effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long-term treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E
