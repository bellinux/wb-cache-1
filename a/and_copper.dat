Bile copper excretion was significantly higher at 7 -mo of pregnancy when samples from both breeds were pooled. From then onwards it declined to its lowest, one week post-partum. During pregnancy, plasma copper concentration increased slightly, reaching its highest level at 7 -mo of pregnancy and then decreased slightly until full term. In pooled samples from both breeds, the correlation between increase in bile <b>copper</b> excretion <b>and</b> plasma <b>copper</b> concentration from 0 to 7 -mo of pregnancy was high (r = 0. 85) and significant (p < 0. 05). Plasma zinc concentration decreased to the lowest level around 6 -mo of pregnancy but increased thereafter until full term. In cows that were dried off one week after parturition, major shifts in bile <b>and</b> plasma <b>copper</b> <b>and</b> zinc parameters occurred at one week following and these coincided with a marked decline of bile flow <b>and</b> bile <b>copper</b> <b>and</b> zinc excretion. By 3 -mo post-partum, biliary <b>copper</b> <b>and</b> zinc excretion <b>and</b> plasma <b>copper</b> <b>and</b> zinc concentrations had reached levels observed prior to pregnancy.
