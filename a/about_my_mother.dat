5|$|For the 72nd Academy Awards, the Academy invited 75 {{countries}} to submit films for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The submission deadline {{was set on}} November 1, 1999. Forty-seven countries submitted films to the Academy, surpassing the record set in 1994. The Asian nations of Bhutan, Nepal and Tajikistan submitted films {{for the first time}} ever. The nominations were announced on February 15, 2000, and the winner was revealed during the awards presentation held on March 26, 2000. Belgium's submission Rosetta was not nominated, even though it had received the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival the previous year. Nepal received its first and so far only nomination for Caravan, a film made in the Tibetan language, which is spoken in parts of Nepal, about the country's now disappearing salt-trade system. The four other nominated films came from France, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The latter received its nomination for Solomon and Gaenor, the first film made entirely in Welsh and Yiddish. Spain eventually won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for Pedro Almodóvar's All <b>About</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother.</b> It was the country's third win after Volver a Empezar (To Begin Again) in 1982 and Belle Époque in 1993. Almodóvar dedicated the award to the Spanish people and to Spain, and had to be dragged from the stage after an overlong speech in which he thanked numerous saints and relatives.|$|E
25|$|All <b>About</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> {{opened at}} the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, where Almodóvar won both the Best Director and the Ecumenical Jury prizes. The film {{garnered}} a strong critical reception and grossed over $67 million worldwide. All <b>About</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> has accordingly received more awards and honours than any other film in the Spanish motion picture industry, including Almodóvar's very first Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the Golden Globe in the same category, the BAFTA Awards for Best Direction and Best Film Not in the English Language as well as 6 Goyas in his native Spain.|$|E
25|$|Pedro Almodóvar's 1999 Academy Award-winning film, All <b>About</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother,</b> {{features}} a Spanish-language {{version of the}} play being performed {{by some of the}} supporting characters and the play itself {{plays an important role in}} the film. However, some of the film's dialogue is taken from the 1951 film version, not the original stage version.|$|E

25|$|After {{the success}} of All <b>About</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother,</b> Almodóvar took a break from filmmaking to focus on his {{production}} company El Deseo. During this break, Almodóvar had an idea for Talk to Her (2002), a film about two men, played by Javier Cámara and Darío Grandinetti, who become friends while {{taking care of the}} comatose women they love, played by Leonor Watling and Rosario Flores. Combining elements of modern dance and silent filmmaking with a narrative that embraces coincidence and fate, in the film, Almodóvar plots the lives of his characters, thrown together by unimaginably bad luck, towards an unexpected conclusion.|$|E
25|$|Almodóvar {{achieved}} {{international recognition}} for his black comedy-drama film Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1988), which {{was nominated for}} the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, {{and went on to}} more success with the dark romantic comedy film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990), the melodrama High Heels (1991) and the romantic drama thriller Live Flesh (1997). His subsequent two films won an Academy Award each: All <b>About</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> (1999) received the award for Best Foreign Language Film while Talk to Her (2002) earned him the award for Best Original Screenplay. Almodóvar followed this with the drama Volver (2006), the romantic thriller Broken Embraces (2009), the psychological thriller The Skin I Live In (2011) and the drama Julieta (2016), all of which were in competition for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. His films are marked by his employment of certain actors and creative personnel, complex narratives, melodrama, pop culture, popular songs, irreverent humour, strong colours, and glossy décor. Desire, passion, family, and identity are among Almodóvar's most prevalent themes.|$|E
500|$|In {{the period}} drama The Girl of Your Dreams (La niña de tus ojos), Cruz portrayed Macarena Granada, a singer {{who is in}} an on-and-off {{relationship}} with Antonio Resines's character, Blas. They {{are part of a}} Francoist film troupe that travels from Spain during the Spanish Civil War to Nazi Germany for a joint production with UFA. Cruz's performance in the film was praised by film critics, with Jonathan Holloland of Variety magazine writing [...] "if confirmation is still needed that Cruz is an actress first and a pretty face second, then here it is". A writer for Film4 commented that [...] "Cruz herself is the inevitable focus of the film" [...] but noted that overall the film [...] "looks great". Cruz's role as Macerna has been viewed as her [...] "largest role to date". For her performance, Cruz received a Goya Award and Spanish Actors' Union Award, and was nominated for a European Film Award. In 1999, Cruz worked with Almodóvar again in All <b>About</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother,</b> playing Sister María Rosa Sanz, a pregnant nun with AIDS. The film received favorable reviews, and was commercially successful, grossing over $67million worldwide, although it performed better at the box office internationally than domestically.|$|E

500|$|Tricky {{explained}} Maxinquayes {{title in}} an interview with Simon Reynolds: [...] "Quaye, that's this race of people in Africa, and 'Maxin,' that's my mum's name, Maxine, and I've just taken the E off"; Reynolds interpreted this as a [...] "place name" [...] similar to the Rastafarian idea of Zion. In another source, Tricky was reported as saying Quaye had also been his mother's surname. According to Greg Kot, his mother's name provided the album its title while her suicide, along with his father abandoning him and Tricky's lack of moral sense as a youth, helped inform his [...] "unsentimental grasp on reality", which was reflected in Maxinquayes [...] "collision of beauty and violence". In the opinion of Stylus Magazines Kenan Hebert, who called it [...] "a document of obsession, mistrust, misconduct, solipsism, and sociopathy", the songs dealing with dysfunctional sexual relationships and fear of intimacy were given a Freudian angle by his mother's influence on the album, including Tricky's reference to her on [...] "Aftermath". In an interview for The Wire, Tricky explained his mother's influence and his use of female vocalists like Topley-Bird: [...] "My first lyric ever on a song was 'your eyes resemble mine, you'll see as no others can'. I didn't have any kids then... so what am I talking about? Who am I talking <b>about?</b> <b>My</b> <b>mother...</b> used to write poetry but in her time she couldn't have done anything with that, there wasn't any opportunity. It's almost like she killed herself to give me the opportunity, my lyrics. I can never understand why I write as a female, I think I've got my mum's talent, I'm her vehicle. So I need a woman to sing that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Almodóvar's next film, All <b>About</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> (1999), {{grew out}} of a brief scene in The Flower of My Secret. The premise {{revolves}} around a woman Manuela (Cecilia Roth), who loses her teenage son, Esteban (Eloy Azorín) in a tragic accident. Filled with grief, Manuela decides to track down Esteban's transgender father, Lola (Toni Cantó), and notify him about the death of the son he never knew he had. Along the way she encounters an old friend, Agrado (Antonia San Juan), and meets up with a pregnant nun, Rosa (Penélope Cruz).|$|E
2500|$|Films {{depicting}} transgender issues include: Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean, The World According to Garp, The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, All <b>About</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> and The Crying Game. The film Different for Girls {{is notable}} for its {{depiction of a}} transsexual woman who meets up with, and forms a romantic relationship with, her former best friend from her all-male boarding school. Ma Vie en Rose portrays a six-year-old child who is gender variant. The film Wild Zero features Kwancharu Shitichai, a transsexual Thai actor. When the main character is conflicted about {{falling in love with}} a [...] "woman who is also a man", Guitar Wolf tells him [...] "Love knows no race, nationality or gender!" ...|$|E

2500|$|All of the episodes' {{titles are}} based on the name of a film or a novel. For example, episode [...] "The Wild Brunch" [...] evokes western film The Wild Bunch and [...] "Seventeen Candles" [...] Sixteen Candles. Episode [...] "All About My Brother" [...] refers to Pedro Almodóvar's All <b>About</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> while [...] "Pret-a-Poor-J" [...] came from Prêt-à-Porter. [...] "There Might Be Blood" [...] took its title from 2007 film There Will Be Blood. [...] "The Serena Also Rises" [...] was titled after novel The Sun Also Rises. The fifth-season episode [...] "The Big Sleep No More" [...] was named for the film The Big Sleep and the New York-based {{production}} Sleep No More. Episode [...] "Easy J" [...] was titled after Emma Stone's hit movie Easy A. Episode [...] "The Age of Dissonance", which was titled after Edith Wharton's novel The Age of Innocence, saw a high school production of the novel taking place, and [...] "The Blair Bitch Project" [...] was named after The Blair Witch Project. [...] "Victor, Victrola" [...] is named after the British-American musical comedy Victor/Victoria. [...] "Bad News Blair" [...] was named after the 1976 movie The Bad News Bears.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{revisited}} Almodóvar's familiar {{themes of}} the power of sisterhood and of family. Almodóvar shot parts of the film in Barcelona and used lush colors to emphasise the richness of the city. Dedicated to Bette Davis, Romy Schneider and Gena Rowlands, All <b>About</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> is steeped in theatricality, from its backstage setting to its plot, modeled on the works of Federico García Lorca and Tennessee Williams, to the characters' preoccupation with modes of performance. Almodóvar inserts a number of references to American cinema. One of the film's key scenes, where Manuela watches her son die, was inspired by John Cassavetes' 1977 film Opening Night. The film's title is also a nod to All About Eve, which Manuela and her son are shown watching in the film. The comic relief of the film centers on Agrado, a pre-operative transsexual. In one scene, she tells the story of her body and its relationship to plastic surgery and silicone, culminating with a statement of her own philosophy: [...] "you get to be more authentic the more you become like what you have dreamed of yourself".|$|E
2500|$|Almodóvar {{revealed}} the film's original title, Silencio, {{in an interview}} with the Financial Times after attending a preview of the musical of his film Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown at the Playhouse Theatre, London, in January 2015. Silence is [...] "the principal element that drives the worst things that happen to the main female protagonist", Almodóvar said. He also stated that the film was a return to drama and his [...] "cinema of women", [...] but claimed that the tone was different to that of his other feminine dramas like The Flower of My Secret (1995), All <b>About</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> (1999) and Volver (2006). He explained that he had finished the script, but was in the process of casting. In March 2015, Rossy de Palma, who frequently appears in Almodóvar's films, confirmed she had a role in the film, followed by the announcement that Emma Suárez and Adriana Ugarte were playing the older and younger versions of the film's protagonist. On the employment of two actresses, Almodóvar later said, [...] "I don't trust the effects of make-up for aging, and it's almost impossible for a young woman of 25 to have the presence of someone of 50. It isn't a matter of wrinkles, it's something more profound, the passing of time, on the outside and on the inside". Suárez also revealed that using two actresses was an homage to That Obscure Object of Desire (1977) by Luis Buñuel, in which two actresses also play the same character at different stages in life. El Deseo revealed more casting in March 2015.|$|E

60|$|I hated asking auntie questions, {{they seemed}} to worry and {{distress}} her so; but that evening, in view of my projected visit to Torquay, I was obliged to cross-examine her rather closely about many things. I wanted to know <b>about</b> <b>my</b> Torquay relations, {{and as far as}} possible <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> family. In the end I learned that the Willie Moores were cousins of ours on <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> side who had never quarrelled with my father, like Aunt Emma, and through whom alone accordingly, in the days of my First State, Aunt Emma was able to learn anything about me. They had a house at Torquay, and connections all around; for the Moores were Devonshire people. Aunt Emma was very anxious, if I went down there at all, I should stop with Mrs. Moore: for Minnie would be so grieved, she said, if I went to an hotel or took private lodgings. But I wouldn't hear of that myself. I knew nothing of the Moores--in my present condition--and I didn't like to trust myself in the hands of those who to me were perfect strangers. So I decided on going to the Imperial Hotel, and calling on the Moores quietly to pursue my investigation.|$|R
