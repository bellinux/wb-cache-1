5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>such</b> ill-fated {{settlement}} was Canemah, {{located near the}} Willamette Falls. Canemah prospered until 1861, when the same great flood swept most of the town over the falls. Even after reconstruction, much of the town's importance to river commerce ended in 1873 with completion of the Willamette Falls Locks. Ships no longer needed to dock and unload goods and passengers for portage around the falls. The remaining town officially survived until 1929, when it was annexed to Oregon City.|$|E

5|$|Another {{round of}} gunnery drills {{followed}} on 1013 January 1915 {{west of the}} Orkneys and Shetlands, {{this time with the}} entire fleet. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Vice Admiral David Beatty's Battlecruiser Fleet, but the main fleet did not become engaged in the Battle of Dogger Bank that took place the following day. On 710 March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. <b>Another</b> <b>such</b> cruise took place on 1619 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 1719 April, followed by gunnery drills off the Shetlands on 2021 April. The Grand Fleet conducted a sweep into the central North Sea on 1719 May without encountering any German vessels. In mid-June, the fleet conducted another round of gunnery training. On 25 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises. On 13 October the majority of the fleet conducted another sweep into the North Sea, returning to port on the 15th.

His cup final team-mate David Peach also played for Andover, this time in the 1983–84 season when he scored five goals for the club.

5|$|During {{the late}} 1820s, Heliade became {{involved}} in cultural policies. In 1827, he and Dinicu Golescu founded Soţietatea literară românească (the Romanian Literary Society), which, through its program (mapped out by Heliade himself), proposed Saint Sava's transformation into a college, the opening of <b>another</b> <b>such</b> institution in Craiova, {{and the creation of}} schools in virtually all Wallachian localities. In addition, Soţietatea attempted to encourage the establishment of Romanian-language newspapers, calling {{for an end to the}} state monopoly on printing presses. The grouping, headquartered on central Bucharest's Podul Mogoşoaiei, benefited from Golescu's experience abroad, and was soon joined by two future Princes, Gheorghe Bibescu and Barbu Dimitrie Ştirbei. Its character was based on Freemasonry; around that time, Heliade is known to have become a Freemason, as did a large section of his generation.|$|E
