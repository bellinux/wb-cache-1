40|$|The {{problems}} of oscillatory and vibratory loading are examined {{from the perspective}} of the rotor's structural response. Blade flap, chord, and torsion responses, from flight or wind tunnel tests of eight full-scale rotors are examined and compared for high-speed flight conditions in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> stall or maneuvers. Some important similarities and differences between rotors are considered, and it is pointed out that these observations are useful in determining the appropriate tests for development of theoretical prediction methods. Among other things, major similarities were found in the dominant flapping vibratory response which occurs at 3 /rev, and the root oscillatory chord bending for the CH- 34, the SA 349 / 2, and the UH- 60 A; differences noted include vibratory chord bending-moment behavior of the rotors, a difference in the damper-induced behavior of CH- 53 A root oscillatory chord bending, and unique torsion and pitch link loading behavior exhibited by the AH 1 -G articulated rotor...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{comprises}} the Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis {{to investigate the}} flow behaviour of a high speed single stage transonic axial flow compressor. Steady state analyses were carried out at design and part speed conditions to obtain the overall performance map using commercial CFD software ANSYS FLUENT. Radial distribution of flow parameters were obtained at 90 % of design speed for the choked flow and near stall flow conditions. The predicted data were validated against available experimental results. The end wall flow fields were studied {{with the help of}} velocity vector plots and Mach number contours at peak efficiency and near stall flow conditions at 60 % and 100 % design speeds. This study exhibited the nature of a transonic compressor, having strong interaction between the rotor passage shock and the tip leakage high blockage in the rotor blade passage.

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades {{numerous}} numerical procedures for crack propagation have been developed. Lately, enrichment methods (either local, such as SDA or global, such as XFEM) have been applied with success to simple problems, typically involving some intersections. For arbitrary finite strain propagation, numerous difficulties are encountered: modeling of intersection and coalescence, step size dependence and the presence of distorted finite elements. In order to overcome these difficulties, an approach fully capable of dealing with multiple advancing cracks and self-contact is presented (see Fig. 1). This approach makes use of a coupled Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method (ALE) and local tip remeshing. This is substantially less costly than a full remeshing while retaining its full versatility. Compared to full remeshing, angle measures and crack paths are superior. A consistent continuationbased linear control is used to force the critical tip to be exactly critical, while moving around the candidate set. The critical crack front is identified and propagated when one of the following criteria reaches a material limiting value: (i) the stress intensity factor; or (ii) the element-ahead tip stress. These are the control equations. The ability to solve crack intersection and coalescence problems is shown. Additionally, the independence from crack tip and step size and the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> and dagger-shaped finite elements is observed. Classic benchmarks are computed leading to excellent crack path and load-deflection results, where convergence rate is quadratic...|$|R

40|$|The Early Aurignacian is {{essentially}} characterised by the manufacture <b>of</b> Aurignacian retouched <b>blades,</b> strangled blades, carinated and nosed scrapers and/or end-scrapers and split-based points, amongst other materials. Both the last artefact and strangled blades are well-established type fossils for this Upper Palaeolithic industry. An apparent <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> strangled <b>blades</b> from {{the archaeological record}} in Eurasia is shown {{by the lack of}} research into this particular topic. In this sense, the main discussion of this thesis centres on possible explanations for this phenomenon. For instance, were strangled blades less fabricated than other types <b>of</b> Aurignacian <b>blades,</b> or have they simply been less studied by researchers? Perhaps their small numbers makes it appear that they are absent when in reality they are not. Additionally, could it be that their production is restricted to certain geographical areas in Eurasia? This thesis consists of a comparative study of 39 Eurasian Early Aurignacian sites, complemented by a case study that focuses on the Early Aurignacian <b>blade</b> assemblage <b>of</b> Les Cottés, a Middle and Upper Palaeolithic site located in France. This last study represents a physical examination of such industry in order to better help the analysis of those 39 sites. This comparative approach highlights a clear low number of sites with strangled blades, since only ten of them have yielded such artefacts. It also highlights a clear concentration of sites in the French region of Aquitaine, along with other sites within the country and the adjacent Spanish Cantabrian region. This phenomenon is verified both in the group with and the group without strangled blades. However, {{this may be due to}} an increased interest in this particular area of Europe, since it appears that the east has been less studied. Moreover, the fact that strangled blades are included in large lithic assemblages, and the fact that there is a lack of studies on them may have quickly induced this picture <b>of</b> <b>absence.</b> It seems that these artefacts only appear to be absence from these archaeological records...|$|R

40|$|Characteristics {{of fluid}} {{dynamics}} and noise of a multiblade radial fan have been experimentally investigated {{with respect to}} the effects of two parameters: inner diameter and the number <b>of</b> <b>blades.</b> The inner diameter D_i of 58 mm gave the highest fan efficiency and pressure coefficient.

40|$|The {{effect of}} leading-edge {{geometry}} on the wake/boundary-layer interaction was studied in a low-speed single-stage HP compressor. Both a 3 : 1 elliptic and a circular leading edge were tested on a controlled diffusion aerofoil stator blade. Experiments were undertaken on the stator suction surface; these included hotwire boundary-layer traverses, surface hotfilm measurements, and high resolution leading-edge pressure measurements. Steady {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) predictions were also performed to aid {{the interpretation of the}} results. The two leading-edge shapes gave rise to significantly different flows. For a blade with an elliptic leading edge (Blade A), the leading-edge boundary layer remained attached and laminar in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> wakes. The wake presence {{led to the formation of}} a thickened laminar boundary layer in which turbulent disturbances were observed to form. Measurements of the trailing-edge boundary layer indicated that the wake/leading-edge interaction for Blade A raised the suction-surface loss by 20 %. For a blade with a circular leading edge (Blade B), the leading-edge boundary-layer exhibited a separation bubble, which was observed to reattach laminar in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> wakes. The presence of the wake moved the separation position forward while inducing a turbulent reattachment upstream of the leading-edge time-average reattachment position. This produced a region of very high momentum thickness at the leading edge. The suction-surface loss was found to be 38 % higher for Blade B than for Blade A.

40|$|Abstract. Blade which {{transfers}} {{thermal energy}} of steam into power, {{is a basic}} component in steam turbine. The reliability <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> is heavily influenced by the operating environment. The rotating blade experiences large inertial load and the wake of nozzle flow impose large variations of aerodynamic load on blade, in addition, the last stage blade is also affected by corrosion, so accidents <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> happen from time to time. Preventing blade failure {{has become one of}} the major objectives of turbine design and in-service maintenance. It is said that the reason for most <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> failure is fatigue fracture. In this study, a synthetical numerical model has been developed to evaluate service life <b>of</b> <b>blade.</b> At first, a numerical model to analyze the excitation force, dynamic frequency and dynamic stress <b>of</b> steam turbine <b>blade</b> has been developed, based on the results of dynamic stress analysis, a model to evaluate the service life <b>of</b> turbine <b>blade</b> has been developed.
