40|$|Patients with {{antibody}} deficiencies {{are more}} prone to develop acute neutropenic episodes even during immunoglobulin replacement. The aims of this study were to evaluate the presence of <b>acute</b> <b>neutropenia</b> in 42 patients with primary antibody immunodeficiencies, currently receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and to describe the clinical and laboratory findings during neutropenic episodes. Of all patients, 10 (23. 8 %) presented <b>acute</b> <b>neutropenia</b> (absolute neutrophil count < 1500 cells/mm(3)) during follow up (mean of 6. 4 yr). The absolute neutrophil count ranged from 71 to 1488 cells/mm(3). Neutropenia was not clearly associated with antibiotic prophylactic therapy or immunoglobulin levels, while infections were associated with neutropenia in the majority of episodes. Most <b>acute</b> <b>neutropenia</b> episodes were mild or moderate, except in CVID patients who present more severe neutropenia. Although IVIG may have contributed to reducing the severity of neutropenia, it does not prevent its occurrence in all patients. In conclusion, primary immunodeficient patients, even submitted to IVIG replacement therapy, must be regularly evaluated for neutropenia in order to minimize the risk of infections and its appropriate approach...|$|E
40|$|Neutropenia {{is defined}} as the {{reduction}} in the absolute number of neutrophils in the blood circulation. <b>Acute</b> <b>neutropenia</b> is a relatively frequent finding, whereas disorders of production of neutrophils are quite rare. <b>Acute</b> <b>neutropenia</b> is often well tolerated and normalizes rapidly. Neutropenia arising as a result of underlying hematologic disorders is far more significant. Such a patient may be at risk for infectious complications and will likely require a thorough investigation. <b>Acute</b> <b>neutropenia</b> evolves over a few days and occurs when neutrophil use is rapid and production is impaired. Chronic neutropenia may last for 3 months or longer and is a result of reduced production, increased destruction, or excessive splenic sequestration of neutrophils. Neutropenia may be classified by whether it arises secondarily to causes extrinsic to BM myeloid cells, which is common; as an acquired disorder of myeloid progenitor cells, which is less frequent; or as an intrinsic defect arising from impaired proliferation and maturation of myeloid progenitor cells in the BM, which is rare. Severe neutropenia with absolute neutrophil counts below 500 /L increases susceptibility to bacterial or fungal infections. Multiple disorders of severe congenital neutropenia have been found by the discovery of genetic defects affecting differentiation, adhesion, and apoptosis of neutrophil precursors. Elucidation of the multiple genetic defects have provided insight into the biology of the cell involving membrane structures, secretory vesicles, mitochondrial metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, transcriptional regulation, and cytoskeletal dynamics, as well as the risk for myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia...|$|E

CdA was given at a fixed dose (5. 6 mg/m 2 /day) as a 2 -h intravenous (i. v.) infusion, immediately followed by a 1 -h i. v. infusion of CP, for 3 days. The initial daily CP dose was 200 mg/m 2, and was escalated by 100 mg/m 2 increments in successive cohorts of three to six patients to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). Additional patients were included at the MTD to extend toxicity and response analysis. Twenty-six patients received 68 cycles of chemotherapy. The MTD of CP after CdA 5. 6 mg/m 2, was 300 mg/m 2. <b>Acute</b> <b>neutropenia</b> was the dose-limiting toxicity of this regimen, which was otherwise well tolerated.

40|$|Hematopoietic tissues are {{the targets}} of {{numerous}} xenobiotics. Clinical hematotoxicity is either a decrease or an increase in peripheral blood cell counts {{in one or more}} cell lineages [...] a cytopenia or a cytosis, respectively [...] that carries a risk of an adverse clinical event. The purpose of in vitro hematotoxicology is the prediction of these adverse hematologic effects from the effects of the toxicants on human hematopoietic targets under controlled experimental conditions in the laboratory. Building on its important foundations in experimental hematology and the wealth of hematotoxicology data found in experimental oncology, this field of alternative toxicology has developed rapidly during the past decade. Although the colony-forming unit-granulocyte/monocyte neutrophil progenitor is most frequently evaluated, other defined progenitors and stem cells as well as cell types found in the marrow stroma can be evaluated in vitro. End points have been proposed for predicting toxicant exposure levels at the maximum tolerated dose and the no observable adverse effect level for the neutrophil lineage, and several clinical prediction models for neutropenia have developed {{to the point that they}} are ready for prospective evaluation and validation in both preclinical species and humans. Known predictive end points are the key to successful comparisons across species or across chemical structures when in vitro dose-response curves are nonparallel. Analytical chemistry support is critical for accurate interpretation of in vitro data and for relating the in vitro pharmacodynamics to the in vivo pharmacokinetics. In contrast to <b>acute</b> <b>neutropenia,</b> anemia and acute thrombocytopenia, as well as adverse effects from chronic toxicant exposure, are much more difficult to predict from in vitro data.

40|$|The {{vascular}} endothelium regulates vasomotor tone and blood fluidity through {{the release of}} paracrine factors, such as nitric oxide (NO). Acutely activated neutrophils {{have been shown to}} consume vasodilatory NO in vitro through the NAD(P) H oxidase-dependent generation of superoxide. As such, neutrophils may contribute to the endothelial dysfunction and increased vascular tone commonly observed in inflammatory vascular diseases. Herein, the experiments in this thesis set out to examine a role for neutrophils in the regulation of vascular tone. Initial experiments aimed to assess the capacity of inflammatory-primed neutrophils to consume NO in vitro. Inflammatory priming of human neutrophils resulted in significantly accelerated rates of NO disappearance from aerobic buffer in vitro in an NAD(P) H oxidase-dependent manner. Thus, neutrophil priming may have a detrimental effect on vascular homeostasis in vivo. With this in mind, subsequent chapters aimed to elucidate a role for neutrophils in regulating vascular tone in vivo using immunodepletion techniques. Following neutrophil depletion, mice exhibited a gradual fall in systolic blood pressure over 3 days, and phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction was significantly attenuated in thoracic aortae isolated from neutropenic animals compared to controls. There effects were due, at least in-part, to the interferon-y-dependent upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) bioactivity in the thoracic aortae of neutropenic mice. Thus, under physiological conditions, neutrophils may modulate vascular tone by negatively regulating the bioactivity of pro-inflammatory enzymes, such as iNOS. Finally, the effect of <b>acute</b> <b>neutropenia</b> on angiotensin (Ang) II-induced hypertension in vivo was examined. Neutrophil depletion prevented the onset of Ang II-induced hypertension, indicating that neutrophils may be directly involved in the development of hypertension associated with this octapeptide in vivo. In conclusion, the data described in this thesis highlight the diversity of neutrophil activities in vivo and in vitro and how changes in neutrophil phenotype may impact upon vascular physiology.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{high cost}} factors to help managers and clinicians to analyse the reasons of adverse costs and provide indications for financial negotiation. DESIGN: To locate high cost or long stay patients, the analysis was designed {{on the basis}} of a mixture of Weibull distributions. In this new model, the proportion of high cost patients was expressed according to the multinomial logistic regression, permitting the determination of high cost factors. SETTING: The 1993 French reference database, constituted in the framework of the national study of DRG costs, conducted by the French Ministry of Health. The database of discharge abstracts recorded in 1993 in the Dijon public teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The analyses were based on 1352 abstracts from the French reference database and 368 from the Dijon database concerning patients, aged 18 and over, suffering from leukaemia and lymphoma.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{relationship}} between oesophageal radiation dose volume metrics and dysphagia in patients having chemoradiation (CRT) for {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) is well established. There is also {{some evidence that}} neutropenia is a factor contributing to the severity of oesophagitis. We retrospectively analysed acute radiation oesophagitis (ARO) rates and severity in patients with NSCLC who received concurrent chemotherapy and high dose radiation therapy (CRT). We investigated if there was an association between grade of ARO, neutropenia and radiation dose volume metrics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with NSCLC having concurrent CRT who had RT dose and toxicity data available were eligible. Exclusion criteria included previous thoracic RT, treatment interruptions and non-standard dose regimens. RT dosimetrics included maximum and mean oesophageal dose, oesophagus dose volume and length data. RESULTS: Fifty four patients were eligible for analysis. 42 (78 %) patients received 60 Gy. Forty four (81 %) patients received carboplatin based chemotherapy. Forty eight (89 %) patients experienced ARO ≥ grade 1 (95 % CI: 78 % to 95 %). ARO grade was associated with mean dose (rs = 0. 27, p = 0. 049), V 20 (rs = 0. 31, p = 0. 024) and whole oesophageal circumference receiving 20 Gy (rs = 0. 32 p = 0. 019). In patients who received these doses, V 20 (n = 51, rs = 0. 36, p = 0. 011), V 35 (n = 43, rs = 0. 34, p = 0. 027) and V 60 (n = 25, rs = 0. 59, P = 0. 002) were associated with RO grade. Eleven of 25 (44 %) patients with ARO ≥ grade 2 also had ≥ grade 2 <b>acute</b> <b>neutropenia</b> compared with 5 of 29 (17 %) patients with RO grade 0 or 1 (p = 0. 035).

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown a marked {{difference in the}} inflammatory response to human C 5 a or C 5 a des arginine (Arg) instilled in rabbit lungs. These studies {{raised the question of}} where C 5 a and C 5 a des Arg are processes in vivo and what role neutrophils may play in the tissue distribution of these two mediators. After intravenous injection of purified, biologically active 125 I-C 5 a or 125 I-C 5 a des Arg, adult rabbits were serially bled and then killed at various time intervals. Although greater than 50 % of the injected radioactivity was cleared from the circulation within 2 min for both mediators, C 5 a des Arg persisted in the circulation longer than C 5 a. C 5 a instillation caused an <b>acute</b> <b>neutropenia,</b> whereas C 5 a des Arg caused a less severe and more prolonged neutropenia, preceding a neutrophilic response observed with both mediators. Clearance of the mediators was primarily seen in the highly vascularized organs: the lung, spleen, liver, and kidney. A time-dependent accumulation was seen initially in the lung, followed by the spleen, liver, and kidney. Histologic examination showed a marked {{increase in the number of}} neutrophils within the lung and spleen. Depletion of circulating neutrophils by nitrogen mustard pretreatment of rabbits showed no change in the amount of labeled mediator bound in the lung, whereas splenic accumulation was dependent on the presence of neutrophils. These results indicate that C 5 a and C 5 a des Arg are rapidly removed from the circulation by specific accumulation in vascularized tissues. Clearance by the lung was not affected by neutrophil depletion, whereas clearance by the spleen was dependent on neutrophils. These experiments further suggest there are neutrophil-dependent and neutrophil-independent mechanisms involved in the removal of C 5 a and C 5 a des Arg from the circulation and that binding of C 5 fragments in the pulmonary vasculature may precede and then induce neutrophil sequestration...|$|E

To examine the contribution of cell adhesion molecules in this process, we used blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to rat selectins and integrins in a model of PMNL margination (reflected by <b>acute</b> blood <b>neutropenia)</b> induced by N-formyl-met-leu-phe (FMLP) chemotactic factor infusion in normal or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -primed rats.

Pretreatment with mAbs to β 2 (WT. 3), VLA- 4 (TA- 2 F(ab) 2), and VLA- 5 (HMα 5 F(ab) 2) in combination inhibited the decrease by 50 % and to a greater degree than β 2 blockade alone (35 % inhibition). F(ab) 2 mAbs to L-(HRL- 3), P-(RMP- 1), plus E-(RME- 1) selectins had no effect but they potentiated inhibition by anti-β 2 + anti-VLA- 4 + anti-VLA 5 mAb treatment (69 % inhibition, P < 0. 05). Similar results were observed in the first 6 minutes in LPS-primed rats with complete inhibition of sequestration thereafter by combined selectin and integrin blockade.

40|$|The {{increase}} {{in the incidence of}} infections due to beta-lactam-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci has resulted in expanded use of vancomycin for such infections. Despite this, coagulase-negative staphylococci have remained susceptible to vancomycin in recent years. This report describes a strain of Staphylococcus haemolyticus with increased resistance to vancomycin (MIC, 8. 0 to 16 micrograms/ml). S. haemolyticus was initially isolated from a patient with <b>acute</b> leukemia and <b>neutropenia</b> in surveillance throat and stool cultures. The microdilution vancomycin MICs for these isolates were 1. 0 to 2. 0 micrograms/ml.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW Fever and {{neutropenia}} is {{the most}} common complication in the treatment of childhood cancer. This review will summarize recent publications that focus on improving the management of this condition as well as those that seek to optimize translational research efforts. RECENT FINDINGS A number of clinical decision rules are available to assist in the identification of low-risk fever and neutropenia however few have undergone external validation and formal impact analysis. Emerging evidence suggests <b>acute</b> fever and <b>neutropenia</b> management strategies should include time to antibiotic recommendations, and quality improvement initiatives have focused on eliminating barriers to early antibiotic administration. Despite reported increases in antimicrobial resistance, few studies have focused on the prediction, prevention, and optimal treatment of these infections and the effect on risk stratification remains unknown. A consensus guideline for paediatric fever and neutropenia research is now available and may help reduce some of the heterogeneity between studies that have previously limited the translation of evidence into clinical practice.

Methods: After a revision of arbitrary drug names and the deletion of duplicated submissions, AERs involving cisplatin (CDDP), carboplatin (CBDCA), or oxaliplatin (L-OHP) were analyzed. Authorized pharmacovigilance tools {{were used for the}} quantitative detection of signals, i. e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. Results: Based on 1, 644, 220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, CDDP, CBDCA, and L-OHP all proved to cause nausea, vomiting, <b>acute</b> renal failure, <b>neutropenia,</b> thrombocytopenia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy. Higher susceptibility to nausea was found for CDDP than CBDCA and L-OHP. Acute renal failure was also more predominant for CDDP, and CBDCA did not increase the blood level of creatinine. A stronger association with thrombocytopenia was suggested for CBDCA. Susceptibility to peripheral sensory neuropathy was greatest for L-OHP, but less extensive for CDDP and CBDCA.

40|$|It is now {{established}} that febrile neutropenic cancer patients constitute a heterogeneous population with a variable risk for serious medical complication development. Optimal patient management should take that risk into account by replacing, for instance, the classical, in-hospital administered, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics by newer therapeutic approaches including oral and/or outpatient therapeutic {{strategies for the}} 'low-risk' patients. The development of such approaches which have been shown safe and feasible, implies the existence of universally accepted, validated and reliable clinical prediction rules for the identification of these low-risk patients. Some prognostic factors predicting {{the response to the}} empiric treatment, the development of a bacteremia, and the final outcome of a febrile neutropenic episode have been established (such as duration and profoundness of <b>neutropenia,</b> <b>acute</b> leukemia, administration of chemotherapy for treatment of relapse, high temperature, shock and/or chills, inpatient status at fever onset) and some models combining them have already been proposed, firstly by Talcott and coworkers and more recently by the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) study section on infections. The sensitivity of these rules as a selection tool for identifying patients at low-risk of complication, however, needs to be improved and we have to assess their clinical usefulness, safety and/or reproducibility better in order to allow a more adequate choice between the therapeutic strategies, to continue to improve patients quality of life and to optimize the cost-effectiveness of the treatments.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure three separate time periods comprising the diagnosis and treatment of candidemia and to determine which one(s) is associated with hospital mortality. Patients with blood cultures positive for Candida spp. were identified. Subjects were excluded if no antifungal therapy was given or if there was preexisting antifungal therapy. Collected data included the time from blood culture collection to positivity (incubation period), the time from blood culture positivity to provider notification (provider notification period), and the time from provider notification to the first dose of antifungal given (antifungal initiation period). These times were assessed as predictors of inpatient mortality. A repeat analysis was done with adjustments for age, sex, race, underlying cancer, catheter removal, APACHE III score, <b>acute</b> renal failure, <b>neutropenia,</b> and non-Candida albicans species. A total of 106 episodes of candidemia were analyzed. The median incubation time was 32. 1 h and was associated with mortality (univariate hazard ratio per hour, 1. 025; P = 0. 001). The median provider notification and antifungal initiation periods were 0. 3 and 7. 5 h, respectively, and were not associated with mortality. Adjusted analysis yielded similar results. For cancer patients with candidemia, the incubation period accounts for a significant amount of time, compared with the provider notification and antifungal initiation times, and is associated with in-hospital mortality. Strategies to shorten the incubation time, such as utilizing rapid molecularly based diagnostic methods, may help reduce in-hospital mortality...|$|R
40|$|Background: Perianal {{infection}} {{is a common}} problem for patients with <b>acute</b> leukemia. However, <b>neutropenia</b> and bleeding tendency are relatively contraindicated to surgical intervention. The epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations and outcomes of perianal infection in leukemic patients are also rarely discussed. Method: The medical records of 1102 adult patients with acute leukemia at a tertiary medical center in Taiwan between 2001 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Result: The prevalence of perianal infection was 6. 7 % (74 of 1102) in adult patients with acute leukemia. Twenty-three (31 %) of the 74 patients had recurrent episodes of perianal infections. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia had higher recurrent rates than acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients (p = 0. 028). More than half (n = 61, 53 %) of the perianal infections were caused by gram-negative bacilli, followed by gram-positive cocci (n = 36, 31 %), anaerobes (n = 18, 15 %) and Candida (n = 1, 1 %) from pus culture. Eighteen patients experienced bacteremia (n = 24) or candidemia (n = 1). Overall 41 (68 %) of 60 patients had polymicrobial infection. Escherichia coli (25 %) {{was the most common}} micro-organism isolated, followed by Enterococcus species (22 %), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13 %), and Bacteroides species (11 %). Twenty-five (34 %) of 74 patients received surgical intervention. Acute leukemia patients with surgically managed anal fistulas tended to have fewer recurrences (p = 0. 067). Four (5 %) patients died within 30 days after diagnosis of perianal infection. Univariate analysis of 30...|$|R
