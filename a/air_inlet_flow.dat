Acquisition, reduction and ancillary programs were written for a Hewlett-Packard 9000 Series 300 computer/HP 3052 Data Acquisition System in HP BASIC 5. 0 / The new software was demonstrated and validated by conducting a set of surveys at the (near to stall) <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> angle of 48 degrees. The survey results showed a diminishing core of two-dimensional flow through the blading due to side wall boundary layer effects, and integration of upstream and downstream measurements gave an axial velocity-density ratio of 1. 108 and a NASA loss coefficient of 0. 097. Prior to the surveys, the probe was calibrated in a free jet facility, thus also revalidating the calibration software.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to realize multivariable control, tuning and online state {{estimation}} of some parameters of the FCC unit. We implemented two control structures with the manipulated variables being the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> rate in the regenerator, the regenerated catalyst flow rate and the feed flow rate and, the controlled variable being the temperatures in the riser and in the densed bed of the regenerator. A novel four transfer function is built and used for controllability studies. Hard constraints are imposed with respect to the manipulated variables. Simulation results show that the configuration made of two inputs and two outputs is more easy to tune for control purposes. Althought there are important dynamic interactions between the components of the FCC and important nonlinearities, linear model predictive control is able to maintain a smooth multivariable control of the plant, while taking into account the different constraints. Tuning strategy is implemented to improve the tracking of the set point. Online state estimation is carried out with the use of the extended Kalman filter.

Direct method was used for determination of the boiler thermal power. Correlation between boiler thermal power and bale residence time has been observed and simple empirical equation has been derived. General conclusions are as follows: the increase of the <b>flow</b> rate of <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> passing through the boiler furnace results in decrease of the bale residence time and increase of the boiler thermal power.

40|$|Fault {{diagnosis}} and durability of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFCs) {{have been identified}} among the critical issues {{that need to be}} overcome for a commercial viability of these power sources. Fuel cells fault diagnosis requires the knowledge of a number of fundamental parameters such as applied current, <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> rate Q, stack temperature and dew point temperature that usually need a special monitoring system and a specifically adapted fuel cell geometry. This might be difficult and even impossible in many fuel cell stacks. Such a constraint could only be possible in a laboratory setup and is not adapted to real application. Moreover, for the transportation application, which aims at minimizing the embedded instrumentation, simple diagnosis methods involving non-intrusive and easy-to-monitor parameters are highly desired. This paper presents a diagnosis procedure of water management issues in fuel cell, namely flooding and drying out, based on a limited number of parameters that are, besides, easyto-monitor. This procedure uses a black-box model based on neural networks that simulates, in case of healthy operation, the evolution of pressure drop at the cathode as well as fuel cell voltage. Two residuals are generated from the comparison between the actual operation of the fuel cell and the parameters calculated by a neural network in case of normal operation. The two residuals analysis permits the detection (by the means of comparison with a predetermined threshold) and the classification of fuel cell’s states-of-health between flooding, drying out or normal operation...|$|E
30|$|This {{first part}} of the {{sensitivity}} analysis, performed on room CO 2 concentrations, provides some interesting insights to reduce concentrations and uncertainties in the presented model configuration. First, an increase in the kitchen extracted flow rate can improve the air change rate, but would be energy consuming. Moreover, although this increase would reduce the average house CO 2 concentration, {{it may not be the}} most effective way to reduce CO 2 exposure in the bedrooms due to airflows in the building. The CO 2 concentration in bedrooms and its uncertainty would be reduced by the following measures: increasing the door undercuts and reducing the living room inlet and leakage areas (better air distribution respecting the expected airflow pattern) or increasing the inlet air area in the bedrooms. This last solution could also be applied in the bathroom, as it would have a beneficial effect on the bathroom CO 2 concentration. The use of CO 2 or presence detection controlled air inlet vents could reduce both the concentrations and the uncertainties. A numerical study conducted by Laverge et al. [13] concludes that CO 2 -controlled inlets can reduce both the exposure to high CO 2 concentration and the building energy demand. The CO 2 concentrations and uncertainties can also be reduced by the use of a balanced ventilation system that would provide an adjusted <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> rate in the different rooms [18]. Furthermore, both balanced ventilation and CO 2 controlled inlet systems are less sensitive to outdoor conditions [13, 14].|$|E

The main purpose is for easy handling and the preservation of the biochemical compounds. The biochemical compound in the powder produced is expected to have properties such as more stable and longer shelf life. K-carrageenan was used as coating material for the encapsulzation during the spray drying process.

40|$|AbstractReburning {{technology}} {{is one of}} the most promising and cost-effective NOx reduction strategies for combustion systems. In this study, NOx reduction in a CO boiler by reburning is investigated. This study adopts a CO boiler from the Formosa Petrochemical Corporation (FPC) in Taiwan as the model for numerical investigation. It is found that NOx reduction occurs mainly behind the DeNOx section where recirculation is strong. Without reburn air, the size of reburn fuel hole does not significantly influence the NOx reduction, although a larger size is a little better. Without reburn air, a larger reburn fuel hole yields a higher temperature near the reburn fuel hole and leads to a better NO reduction. Injection of reburn fuel without reburn air results in higher CO emission. For a “richer” primary fuel without reburn air, reburn fuel fraction and injection location do not significantly influence the NOx reduction. The reburn air closer to the reburn fuel yields a lower NO emission. Temperature decreases first and arises then near the reburn air injection location. Combustion is more complete when the <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate is increased. Increase of <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate yields a higher NO emission and a lower CO emission.

40|$|The {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) modeling technique {{was applied to the}} estimation of maximum benzene concentration for the vapor space inside a large-scaled and high-level radioactive waste tank at Savannah River site (SRS). The objective of the work was to perform the calculations for the benzene mixing behavior in the vapor space of Tank 48 {{and its impact on the}} local concentration of benzene. The calculations were used to evaluate the degree to which purge air mixes with benzene evolving from the liquid surface and its ability to prevent an unacceptable concentration of benzene from forming. The analysis was focused on changing the tank operating conditions to establish internal recirculation and changing the benzene evolution rate from the liquid surface. The model used a three-dimensional momentum coupled with multi-species transport. The calculations included potential operating conditions for air inlet and exhaust flows, recirculation flow rate, and benzene evolution rate with prototypic tank geometry. The flow conditions are assumed to be fully turbulent since Reynolds numbers for typical operating conditions are in the range of 20, 000 to 70, 000 based on the inlet conditions of the air purge system. A standard two-equation turbulence model was used. The modeling results for the typical gas mixing problems available in the literature were compared and verified through comparisons with the test results. The benchmarking results showed that the predictions are in good agreement with the analytical solutions and literature data. Additional sensitivity calculations included a reduced benzene evolution rate, reduced air inlet and exhaust flow, and forced internal recirculation. The modeling results showed that the vapor space was fairly well mixed and that benzene concentrations were relatively low when forced recirculation and 72 cfm ventilation air through the tank boundary were imposed. For the same 72 cfm <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> but without forced recirculation, the heavier benzene gas was stratified.

40|$|Air {{conditioning}} {{has traditionally}} been achieved by vapour compression equipment, which is considered very efficient when handling loads characterised by high sensible load fraction. These machines would perform poorly when they process air with high latent load fraction {{as in the case}} of humid climates. Global energy concern has accelerated the research on alternative technology options to replace traditional method or improve their performance. Hybrid liquid desiccant system has been proposed as an energy saving alternative to reduce the vapour compression unit size used in air conditioning application, and improve its performance. A hybrid system consisting of vapour compression unit, a liquid desiccant system consisting of an absorber and a regenerator, both of which are identical packed spray towers built from fibre glass with a cross sectional area of 600 x 600 mm from five pieces each. Each piece having a height of 200 mm to facilitate testing different heights of packing material, and a flat plate solar hot water collector with an auxiliary electrical heater to be used as supplement when solar energy is not enough or not available. This hybrid system was designed, fabricated and tested with emphasis on liquid desiccant sub-system. In this study, the performance of the absorber and the regenerator, which are the main items in the liquid desiccant system, was studied in terms of effectiveness. Both units were tested over a range of different inlet liquid desiccant concentration of 20 % to 40 % by weight, and inlet temperature of 20 oC, 25 oC, and 30 oC for the absorber, and 20 %, 25 % and 30 % liquid desiccant concentration at temperature range of 35 oC to 55 oC for the regenerator. Both components were tested at liquid desiccant flow rate between 3. 76 to 5. 01 l/min with different <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> rate 4. 9 to 6. 4 m 3 /min. Experimental results were recorded using a complete data acquisition system to collect and log the data of the desiccant sub-system and the vapour compression unit, which enables thermocouples readings. From the data collected, the coefficient of performance of the vapour compression unit was obtained using both refrigerant enthalpy and air enthalpy methods. Absorber effectiveness was found to be between 0. 5 and 0. 7, while the regenerator effectiveness was found to be between 0. 2 and 0. 6. A 800 mm packing height is found to be the breaking limit with both air supply either fully through the desiccant or partly (50 % through the desiccant), would result in an improvement in the performance of the vapour compression unit ranging from 17. 9 % to 54 %, which indicate the hybrid system potential for energy savings.

40|$|The {{cross flow}} from channel to channel through gas {{diffusion}} layer (GDL) under the land could {{play an important}} role for water removal in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. In this study, characteristics of liquid water removal from GDL have been investigated experimentally, through measuring unsteady pressure drop in a cell which has the GDL initially wet with liquid water. The thickness of GDL is carefully controlled by inserting various thicknesses of metal shims between the plates. It has been found that severe compression of GDL could result in excessive pressure drop from channel inlet to channel outlet. Removing liquid water from GDL by cross flow is difficult for GDL with high compression levels and for low <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates. However, effective water removal can still be achieved at high compression levels of GDL if the <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate is high.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Even though {{considerable}} {{research has}} been devoted to the drying of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and other pharmaceutical proteins, the majority of this research has focused on lyophilisation or spray drying (SD) for inhalation. Powders for reconstitution and subcutaneous (SC) injection need to comply with a significantly different set of product characteristics than those for inhalation. Therefore, following a formulation screening, the impact of spray drying process parameters on both powder characteristics and short- and long-term stability was determined for a model mAb formulation, using a design of experiments (DoE) approach that combined statistical tools with a set of orthogonal analytical techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS The mAb formulation was spray dried using a ProCepT Micro-Spray with <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate, <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> temperature, nozzle air flow rate, feed rate, feed concentration and nozzle diameter as factors which were varied at three levels according to a D-optimal design. The following responses were measured and evaluated for this study: Yield, angle of repose, residual water content (Karl Fischer titration), reconstitution time, particle size distribution (laser diffraction), particle morphology (SEM), solid state characterisation (XRPD and DSC), aggregation (SEC, DLS, OD 600). RESULTS Descriptive statistical models were obtained for several responses, suggesting the <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate {{to be one of the}} overall most influential process parameters. Large variations in particle morphology were observed with SEM, revealing that particle size distribution models, although statistically significant, were not representative for any relevant powder property. Additionally, the location of powder collection, i. e. collector/cyclone versus transport tube, had a noticeable influence on the particle size distribution of the spray dried powders. CONCLUSIONS Descriptive models were generated for a model mAb, which could prove to be useful tools in improving our understanding of process parameter influences on the mAb stability and particle characteristics of powders for reconstitution. The presented data also emphasises the importance of using orthogonal techniques and keeping the physicochemical meaning of responses in mind when designing a (bio) pharmaceutical drying process. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, air {{preheater}} is used the research object and its heat transfer law is studied by experiment and numerical simulation. The experimental {{data showed that}} with the increases of <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> velocity, the comprehensive heat transfer coefficient and heat transfer efficiency increase, but the temperature efficiency decreases and the resistance loss on the air side increases. The numerical simulation {{results showed that the}} larger the diameter of the tube, the better the heat transfer effect. When horizontal spacing in the range of 290 - 305 mm and longitudinal spacing is 70 - 90 mm, the heat transfer effect is best. The optimized heat exchanger structure is that diameter is 60 mm, horizontal spacing is 300 mm, longitudinal spacing is 90 mm. As the <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate increases, the heat transfer efficiency increases, but the temperature efficiency decreases and the resistance loss on the air side increases...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} automation procedure {{has been}} developed {{to be used in}} conjunction with an inverse hodograph method for the design of controlled diffusion blades. With this procedure a cascade of airfoils with a prescribed solidity, inlet Mach number, <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> angle, and air flow turning can be produced automatically. The trailing edge thickness of the airfoil, an important quantity in inverse methods, is also prescribed. The automation procedure consists of a multidimensional Newton iteration in which the objective design conditions are achieved by acting on the hodograph input parameters of the underlying inverse code. The method, although more general in scope, is applied in this paper to the design of axial flow compressor blade sections, and a wide range of examples is presented...|$|R
