5000|$|During {{the debate}} over <b>airspace</b> <b>reservation,</b> an {{explosive}} was set off near the Rom family home as a scare tactic. [...] During the motorized and snowmobile BWCAW use debates of the 70's, snowmobiles circled the Rom's house {{at all hours of}} the night. In 1974 Rom testified in Washington against motorized access. In 1975, during the important fishing opener and Memorial Day weekend, persons unhappy with his efforts blocked the entrance to his business with logging trucks.

Bob Olson Sr. said: [...] "There were a few people who like going back there with a canoe to fish.....but we never figured on crowds. Now you have to get a permit." ...|$|E
50|$|The Omnibus Territories Act of 2013 would {{convey to}} the {{government}} of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) submerged lands surrounding such Islands and extending three geographical miles outward from their coastlines.

50|$|If enacted H.R. 573 would {{accomplish}} {{two main}} things. First, {{to the government}} of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, it would convey submerged lands surrounding such Islands and extending three geographical miles outward from their coastlines.

5000|$|The bill H.R. 573 (...) (long title: To amend Public Law 93-435 {{with respect}} to the Northern Mariana Islands, {{providing}} parity with Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa) is a bill that was introduced into the United States House of Representatives in the 113th United States Congress. The bill would extend the geographic boundaries of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and would allow the United States Military to establish naval defensive sea areas and <b>airspace</b> <b>reservations</b> when necessary for national defense.|$|R

40|$|The primary aim of {{this work}} is the {{description}} and study of the technical and operational validation of an interface between an {{air traffic control system}} and an airspace management system to exchange data in real time. An intensive introduction to the functioning of the two system and particularly the interfaces is necessary to describe the validation technical correct. Technical aspects as well as functional aspects (settlement of <b>airspace</b> <b>reservations</b> in the accounting system as well as the activation of airspace in the air traffic control system) have to be understood and then described in a structured document...|$|R
40|$|The problem {{posed by}} Winsland Consulting was {{concerned}} with finding an efficient correlation between a 4 D flight path (the civilian require- ment) and a 4 D volume of restricted airspace (due to weather or mili- tary use). It further asked how this {{could be used to}} explore the best shape of <b>airspace</b> <b>reservations</b> in respect of: sensitivity to civil demand (daily and seasonal); best configuration (shape and time); and the best times to release military sectors to civil traffic (network and local level). The ESGI mathematicians developed a number of approaches that gave confidence that an airspace optimisation tool is feasible...|$|R
