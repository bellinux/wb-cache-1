5|$|At , Hughes faced future UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk, winning via {{unanimous}} decision. Hughes {{started the}} action by taking Sherk down immediately, passing to half guard. Sherk {{was able to}} stand {{for a few seconds}} before Hughes took him down again. In round two, they started to trade punches, but eventually Hughes took Sherk down. Like the first round, they stood up for <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>At</b> the beginning of the third round, Sherk took Hughes down, while Hughes attempted a kimura from the bottom. A late stand up led to a second takedown by Sherk. Round 4 saw Hughes using his strength to control the challenger on the ground. Sherk took Hughes down again in the fifth round, but the champion controlled {{the rest of the time}} sprawl-and-brawling as he finished on top. With the victory, he became the first man to ever defeat Sherk.|$|E
25|$|After marrying, Joseph and Jessie Wilson {{moved to}} the Southern United States in 1851 and came to fully {{identify}} with it, moving from Virginia deeper into the region as Wilson became a minister in Georgia and South Carolina. Joseph Wilson owned slaves, defended slavery, and also set up a Sunday school for his slaves. Both parents identified with the Confederacy during the American Civil War; they cared for wounded soldiers at their church, and Wilson's father briefly served as a chaplain to the Confederate Army. Woodrow Wilson's earliest memory, {{from the age of}} three, was of hearing that Abraham Lincoln had been elected and that a war was coming. Wilson would forever recall standing for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> General Robert E. Lee's side and looking up into his face.|$|E
500|$|McKinley's trip to Buffalo {{was part}} of a planned ten-day absence from Canton, {{beginning}} on September 4, 1901, which was to include a visit in Cleveland to an encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic; he was a member as a Union veteran. [...] The McKinleys stayed in Buffalo at the Milburn House, the large home of the Exposition's president, John G. Milburn. [...] On Saturday, September 7, they were to travel to Cleveland and stay first at the home of businessman and future Ohio governor Myron Herrick, a friend of the President, and then with McKinley's close friend and adviser, Ohio Senator Mark Hanna. [...] Upon arrival in Buffalo, the presidential party was driven through the fairgrounds {{on the way to the}} Milburn House, pausing for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> the Triumphal Bridge at the Exposition so the visitors could look upon the fair's attractions.|$|E

500|$|The website Rotten Tomatoes, which categorizes reviews as {{positive}} or negative, surveyed 37 critics {{and determined that}} 38% of the reviews were positive with a rating average of 4.9 out of 10. The website gives the consensus summary: [...] "While unconventional, Tank Girl isn't particularly clever or engaging, {{and none of the}} script's copious one-liners have any real zing." [...] Lamar Hafildason of the BBC gave the film one out of five stars, saying: [...] "Sadly, the BBC does not pay out for one-word reviews. If it did, then this review would read simply: 'tiresome'." [...] In 2001, Matt Brunson from Creative Loafing gave the film one and a half stars out of four concluding: [...] "a rockin' soundtrack... and a peek at Watts early in her career are the only ingredients saving this from a bomb rating." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars. While praising the film's ambition and energy, he said he could not [...] "care about it for much more than <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> a time, and after a while its manic energy wore [...] down." ...|$|E
2500|$|The B-sections of {{the plays}} {{tend to be}} songs in which the {{characters}} express their mood or character, or sing of love. The C-sections (in trochaic septenarii) tend {{to be associated with}} advancement of the plot. [...] "The beginning of the first long series of trochaic septenarii usually marks <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> which, after exposition and presentation of character, the plot begins to proceed in earnest." [...] (Moore) When a playwright moves directly from A to C, it often marks urgency or an especially significant moment in the plot.|$|E
2500|$|The {{architectural}} {{decoration of}} the surviving phase includes different and unusual motifs (e.g. the grooves of the column trunks, which are not all equal, but alternately wider and narrower). [...] This shows <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> which a new decorative style is being elaborated, amalgamating the Italic architectural style of the Republic (as shown, for example, in the Temple of Portunus) with the influences of the Hellenistic Greek East, emphasizing the old values of Augustus's new status quo whilst showing the regime's innovative cultural credentials. [...] This style would later be codified in the Forum of Augustus. [...] Other new features include the insertion of decorative elements meant to celebrate Octavian, such as the laurel in the frieze and capitals.|$|E

2500|$|Brinsmead's early {{views were}} an {{expression}} of [...] "historic Adventism". His primary opponents were his friend and former classmate Desmond Ford, for sixteen years head of the Department of Religion at Avondale College, Hans LaRondelle of the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary at Andrews University, and Edward Heppenstall,. In the 1960s he advocated a form of perfectionism which he described as the [...] "Sanctuary Awakening" [...] or [...] "Awakening" [...] message. The [...] "sanctuary" [...] element referred to the distinctive Seventh-day Adventist theological understanding of events believed to have begun in the year 1844 in a heavenly sanctuary, of which the earthly sanctuary in the Old Testament was understood to be a figure and [...] "type". In contrast to legalistic perfectionism, Brinsmead believed that as Jesus finished his mediatorial work in the heavenly sanctuary prior to the second advent, a special outpouring of the Holy Spirit would perfect and seal believers and grant them the ability to live sinlessly {{without the need for}} a mediator. [...] In so doing, he moved the point of spiritual transformation of living believers at the end of earth's history from <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> the Second Coming (along with the physical transformation described in 1 Corinthians 15), as believed by many Christians, to a unique event before it. [...] He claimed he was led to this position by the pre-advent judgment in Seventh-day Adventist eschatology. He also claimed it was a thoroughly evangelical concept of justification â€“ [...] "I taught sanctification by atonement, not by attainment." ...|$|E
