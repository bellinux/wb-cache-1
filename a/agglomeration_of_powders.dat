Their wettability was manipulated through the surface tension of the liquid, which was varied by the alcohol–water ratio. On coarse powders (glass beads and coal dust) the droplet either penetrates into the porous bed (at low surface tensions and contact angles), or sits on top and evaporates (at higher surface tensions and contact angles). Particles spontaneously coat drops of intermediate surface tension. The coating slows evaporation and remains as a dry agglomerate after evaporation. Drops that do not penetrate into the fine powder beds (molybdenite) spontaneously roll away, even when deposited carefully. The reason is that the powder surface behaves like a superhydrophobic one.
