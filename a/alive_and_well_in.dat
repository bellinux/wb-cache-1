5|$|According to Josiffe's account, a {{homosexual}} liaison with Thorpe began that same evening, at Thorpe's mother's home in Oxted, and continued for several years. Thorpe, while acknowledging that a friendship developed, denied any sexual dimension in the relationship. He organised accommodation for Josiffe in London, and a longer-term {{stay with a}} family in Barnstaple, within the North Devon constituency. He paid for advertisements in Country Life magazine, {{in an effort to}} find work with horses for his friend, arranged various temporary jobs, and promised to help Josiffe to realise an ambition to study dressage in France. On the basis of Josiffe's claim that his father had died in an air crash, Thorpe's solicitors investigated whether any money was due, but found that Albert Josiffe was <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> Orpington.|$|E
5|$|Polycystic {{kidney disease}} (PKD) is a slowly {{progressive}} disease affecting Persian and Persian-related breeds, in which fluid-filled cysts expand within the kidneys, destroying functional tissue. While renal cysts are observed {{with a low}} incidence in Maine Coons, PKD {{appears to be a}} misnomer in this particular breed. In a recent study spanning 8 years, renal cysts were documented by ultrasound in 7 of 187 healthy Maine Coons enrolled in a pre-breeding screening programme. The cysts were mostly single and unilateral (6/7, 85.7%) small (mean 3.6mm in diameter) and located at corticomedullary junction (4/6, 66.7%), thus different in size, numbers and location from those observed in Persian-related breeds. In the same study, not only did all six Maine Coon cats with renal cysts test negative for the PKD1 mutation, proving the disease in these cats to be unrelated to the PKD observed in Persians and related breeds, but gene sequencing of these cats failed to demonstrate any common genetic sequences. The presence of renal cysts, in the absence of other changes, does not appear to negatively impact the patients' quality of life, as those for which follow-up was available were reported <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> adulthood. Although the exact nature and clinical relevance of renal cysts in Maine Coons is currently unknown, its screening is still recommended for pre-breeding assessment. Ultrasonography is currently the only valid diagnostic method for its detection in this breed.|$|E

25|$|Dutugemunu's {{mother was}} Viharamahadevi, {{daughter}} of Tissa, king of Kalyani.

To placate it Tissa placed his daughter Devi in a golden boat with the words 'A King's Daughter' written on the side, and set her out to sea.

25|$|Following {{the great}} success of Curtain, Christie gave {{permission}} {{for the release}} of Sleeping Murder sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be released. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared {{to the rest of the}} Marple series— for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> Sleeping Murder although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.|$|E

25|$|In X-Men: Days of Future Past, the time-displaced Wolverine {{encourages}} the young Charles Xavier to later recruit Jean Grey {{for the future}} team, along with Ororo Munroe and Scott Summers, arguing that the good they accomplished outweighs the bad they experienced. Commentary in the film confirms that the young red-haired girl's identity in the field who was marveling at Magneto levitating the Robert F. Kennedy stadium was in fact Jean Grey as a young child. When the timeline resets, Logan is astonished to discover that Jean and Cyclops are <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> the new timeline, suggesting that {{the events of the}} original X-Men films played out very differently.|$|E
25|$|In February 2010, Gordon Lightfoot was {{the victim}} of a death hoax {{originating}} from Twitter, when then-CTV journalist David Akin posted on Twitter and Facebook that Lightfoot had died. Lightfoot was at a dental appointment at the time the rumors spread and found out when listening to the radio on his drive home. Lightfoot dispelled those rumors by phoning Charles Adler of CJOB, the DJ and radio station he heard reporting his demise, and did an interview expressing that he was <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well.</b> <b>In</b> 2012, Lightfoot continued to tour, telling a sold-out crowd June 15 at Ottawa's National Arts Centre that he still performs sixty times a year. Lightfoot played two shows at the NAC after his induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.|$|E
25|$|Plants are {{referred}} to as annuals which live only one year, biennials which live two years, and perennials which live longer than that. The longest-lived perennials, woody-stemmed plants such as trees and bushes, often live for hundreds and even thousands of years (one may question whether or not they may die of old age). A giant sequoia, General Sherman is <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> its third millennium. A Great Basin Bristlecone Pine called Methuselah is 4,848 years old (as of 2017) and the Bristlecone Pine called Prometheus was a little older still, at least 4,844 years (and possibly as old as 5,000 years), when it was cut down in 1964. The oldest known plant (possibly oldest living thing) is a clonal Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) tree colony in the Fishlake National Forest in Utah called Pando at about 80,000 years. Lichen, a symbiotic algae and fungal proto-plant, such as Rhizocarpon geographicum can live upwards of 10,000 years.|$|E

25|$|Evil businesswoman Angelica Nero {{intends to}} kill J.R. {{and his cousin}} Jack for double {{crossing}} her, but J.R. has her apprehended by the police. Unfortunately, Angelica has already had a bomb attached to Jack's car, which explodes with Jamie inside. After hearing this on the phone, J.R. runs {{out of his office}} to go to Jack's apartment. As he leaves the office, Sue Ellen arrives in the other elevator looking for him. As soon as she enters J.R.'s office, another bomb left by Angelica goes off, and the entire floor that houses Ewing Oil explodes, showering debris onto the street below. The scene then shifts to Pam in bed, the day after her marriage to Mark Graison. Pam wakes up to hear the shower running.

500|$|According to Wallace, [...] "for us Aspasia herself {{possesses}} and can possess {{almost no}} historical reality". Hence, Madeleine M.

She finally concludes that [...] "it {{is possible to}} map only the barest possibilities for [...] life". According to Charles W. Fornara and Loren J.

500|$|In {{a running}} gag most {{prevalent}} {{during the first}} five seasons of the series, Kenny would suffer an excruciating death before returning <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> the next episode {{with little or no}} definitive explanation given.

Since the show began its sixth season in 2002, the practice of killing Kenny has been seldom used by the show's creators. Various episodes have set up the gag, sometimes presenting a number of explanations for Kenny's unacknowledged reappearances.|$|E
500|$|Encouraged by a clairvoyant's {{assurance}} that her elder son was <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well,</b> <b>in</b> February 1863 Lady Tichborne, Roger's mother, began placing regular newspaper advertisements in The Times offering {{a reward for}} information about Roger Tichborne {{and the fate of}} the Bella. None of these produced results; however, in May 1865 Lady Tichborne saw an advertisement placed by Arthur Cubitt of Sydney, Australia, on behalf of his [...] "Missing Friends Agency". She wrote to him, and he agreed to place a series of notices in Australian newspapers.

A [...] "most liberal reward" [...] would be given [...] "for any information that may definitely point out his fate".|$|E
500|$|For {{these and}} other reasons, belief in {{evolutionary}} progress has remained [...] "a persistent heresy", among evolutionary biologists including E. O. Wilson and Simon Conway Morris, although often denied or veiled. The philosopher of biology Michael Ruse wrote that [...] "some {{of the most significant}} of today's evolutionists are progressionists, and that because of this we find (absolute) progressionism <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> their work." [...] He argued that progressionism has harmed the status of evolutionary biology as a mature, professional science. Presentations of evolution remain characteristically progressionist, with humans {{at the top of the}} [...] "Tower of Time" [...] in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., while Scientific American magazine could illustrate the history of life leading progressively from mammals to dinosaurs to primates and finally man. Ruse noted that at the popular level, progress and evolution are simply synonyms, as they were in the nineteenth century, though confidence in the value of cultural and technological progress has declined.|$|E
