5000|$|... #Caption: Working {{mechanism}} of a valveless pulse jet engine. The basic {{idea is that}} the column of air in the long exhaust pipe functions like the piston of a reciprocating engine. From another point of view, the engine is an acoustic resonator internally excited by resonating combustions in the chamber. The chamber acts as a pressure antinode which is compressed by the returning wave. The intake pipe acts as a kinematic antinode which sucks and exhausts gas. Note the longer length of the exhaust pipe—this is important as it prevents oxygen from entering the wrong way and igniting the system the wrong way. It does this because when the pulse ignites, there is still some exhaust gas in the exhaust pipe. That is sucked in before any additional oxygen is sucked in. Of course, the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>pipe</b> has already supplied the oxygen by that point and the pulse reignites.|$|E

5000|$|There were {{unprecedented}} Soviet {{requests for}} Western technological aid {{with the development}} of the Tu-144. The request was made despite obviously not helping to foster Soviet technological prestige, {{which was one of the}} key purposes of the Tu-144 programme. In 1977, the USSR approached Lucas Industries, a designer of the engine control system for Concorde, requesting help with the design of the electronic management system of the Tu-144 engines, and also asked BAC-Aérospatiale for assistance in improving the Tu-144 <b>air</b> <b>intakes.</b> (The design of air intakes' variable geometry and their control system was one of the most intricate features of Concorde, contributing to its fuel efficiency. Over half of the wind-tunnel time during Concorde development was spent on the design of <b>air</b> <b>intakes</b> and their control system.) In late 1978, the USSR requested a wide range of Concorde technologies, evidently reflecting the broad spectrum of unresolved Tu-144 technical issues. The list included de-icing equipment for the leading edge of the <b>air</b> <b>intakes,</b> fuel-system <b>pipes</b> and devices to improve durability of these pipes, drain valves for fuel tanks, fireproof paints, navigation and piloting equipment, systems and techniques for acoustical loading of airframe and controls (to test against acoustic fatigue caused by high jet-noise environment), ways to reinforce the airframe to withstand damage, firefighting equipment, including warning devices and lightning protection, emergency power supply, and landing gear spray guards (aka water deflectors or [...] "mud flaps" [...] that increase engine efficiency when taking off from wet airstrips). These requests were denied after the British government vetoed them on the ground that the same technologies, if transferred, could be also employed in Soviet bombers. Soviet approaches were also reported in British mainstream press of the time, such as The Times.|$|R

Throttling the charge in the <b>intake</b> <b>pipe</b> is a simpler method than coolant injection into the <b>intake</b> <b>pipe</b> particularly when only one cylinder is considerably hotter than any other.

50|$|Most {{vehicles}} manufactured {{from the}} mid-1970s until the mid-1990s have thermostatic <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> systems that regulate {{the temperature of}} the air entering the engine's intake tract, providing warm air when the engine is cold and cold air when the engine is warm to maximize performance, efficiency, and fuel economy.

Aftermarket cold <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> systems are marketed with claims of increased engine efficiency and performance.

40|$|The {{intake system}} {{is one of}} the {{components}} on the internal combustion engine most linked with the achievement of the high volumetric efficiency required of naturally aspirated engines. High performance racing engine intake systems have unusual geometry with separate <b>intake</b> <b>pipes</b> (often known as intake trumpets) housed in a common airbox. These intake trumpets are short pipes that are sometimes cylindrical but often conical. The flow within the intake system is very unsteady with high frequency wave action taking place. A carefully developed intake trumpet can use the wave action to tune the engine and therefore increase the performance distinctly. The intake tuning is strongly dependent on the acoustic properties of the intake system. Two important parameters are the pressure wave reflection coefficient at the open inflow end of the <b>intake</b> <b>pipe</b> (to tune the engine effectively) and the acoustic length of the <b>intake</b> <b>pipe</b> (to tune the engine at the appropriate engine speed). Acoustic measurements show that the open inflow end reflection coefficient decreases with inflow but increases with external (coaxial) flow. CFD calculations show that the vena contract a which gets created at the open inflow to the pipe disappears with coaxial flow. A conical inflow shape decreases the reflection coefficient at certain frequencies and influences the phase angle of the acoustic waves. One dimensional prediction models for the wave transfer inside these conical <b>intake</b> <b>pipes</b> are validated against acoustic measurement results. 4 The airbox decreases the reflection coefficient distinctly due to three dimensional resonances inside the airbox and limits the use of one dimensional prediction models, but the acoustic length can still be predicted accurately. Fuelling inside the <b>intake</b> <b>pipe</b> decreases the speed of sound by 10 % and thus increases the acoustic pipe length. Therefore it influences the engine tuning and needs be considered when developing intake systems. A new acoustic measurement method is introduced which allows the measurement of the acoustic pipe length within the conical part of the <b>intake</b> <b>pipe.</b> Finally, the time varying nature of the intake flow and intake acoustics is explored on a running racing engine by means of hot-wire and pressure measurements and shows the influence of intake acoustics on the fluctuating intake airflow velocity especially during the period when the intake valves are closed...|$|R
