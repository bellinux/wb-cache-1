5|$|Following the {{supposed}} deciphering of the Egyptian alphabet in July and October 1835, Smith ostensibly translated {{the majority of}} the Book of Abraham in November 1835 <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> minor revisions in March 1842. In translating the book, Smith dictated and Phelps, Warren Parrish, and Frederick G. Williams acted as scribes. The complete work was first published serially in Times and Seasons in 1842, and was later canonized in 1880 by the LDS Church as part of its Pearl of Great Price.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} balance issues, {{the game was}} initially very difficult, especially in the later stages. Nakamura had written a program that simulated every single combat {{that he used to}} adjust the games setting for character leveling and the strength of enemies players would encounter. This program failed to account for larger monster groups, however, which fell outside the model and caused the game to be very difficult. Further more, enemies leveling and weapons power were designed by area, but Koichi Nakamura didn't think over the boat, so if player get the boat to some land might be quickly killed. The developers realized there was a balance problem <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> modifications, such as limiting the number of enemies in Midenhall to groups of three, and moving the Cannock Castle closer to Midenhall Castle.|$|E
5|$|Flanagan's first {{concert was}} around 1945, with trombonist Frank Rosolino. Given Flanagan was only around 15 {{years old at}} the time, he could not stay in the bar area of the club; between sets, therefore, he went to another room <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> homework. As a teenager, he played in a band led by Lucky Thompson that also {{contained}} Pepper Adams and Kenny Burrell. Still in his teens, Flanagan also sat in on piano for some appearances by Charlie Parker in Detroit. During 1949, Flanagan had his first residence, at the Blue Bird Inn in Detroit. In 1950 he played with Rudy Rutherford, until the clarinetist returned to the Count Basie band. Flanagan then played jazz and rhythm and blues with saxophonist George Benson in Toledo, before being drafted into the army in 1951.|$|E

5|$|In fact, Puccini was {{at first}} less than {{enthusiastic}} about the idea for this comic opera– Florence as a setting did not appeal to him, and he feared the public would have {{little interest in the}} subject. However, he soon became interested, <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> work on the piece even while composing Suor Angelica. The religious-themed opera was completed in September 1917, and Puccini turned his full attention to Gianni Schicchi, although the war news and the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which Puccini lost a sister, distracted him from his work. The first draft was completed on 20 April 1918, and Puccini continued to refine and orchestrate it through the summer of 1918.|$|E

She also occasionally worked for other clients <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> pro bono work for women in family court. She spent time at local Democratic clubs, which allowed her to maintain contacts within the legal profession and become involved in local politics and campaigns. While organizing community opposition to a proposed building, Ferraro met lawyer and Democratic figure Mario Cuomo, who became a political mentor. In 1970, she {{was elected president of}} the Queens County Women's Bar Association.|$|E
5|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Berry was {{the fourth}} child {{in a family of}} six. He grew up in the north St. Louis {{neighborhood}} known as the Ville, an area where many middle-class people lived. His father, Henry William Berry (1895–1987), was a contractor and deacon of a nearby Baptist church; his mother, Martha Bell (Banks) (1894–1980), was a certified public school principal. Berry's upbringing allowed him to pursue his interest in music from an early age. He gave his first public performance in 1941 while still a student at Sumner High School; he was still a student there in 1944, when he was arrested for armed robbery after robbing three shops in Kansas City, Missouri, and then stealing a car at gunpoint with some friends. Berry's account in his autobiography is that his car broke down and he flagged down a passing car and stole it at gunpoint with a nonfunctional pistol. He was convicted and sent to the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men at Algoa, near Jefferson City, Missouri, where he formed a singing quartet <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> boxing. The singing group became competent enough that the authorities allowed it to perform outside the detention facility. Berry was released from the reformatory on his 21st birthday in 1947.|$|E

5|$|Toy Storys {{script was}} {{strongly}} influenced by the ideas of screenwriter Robert McKee. The members of Pixar's story team—Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Joe Ranft—were aware {{that most of them}} were beginners at writing for feature films. None of them had any feature story or writing credits to their name besides Ranft, who had taught a story class at CalArts <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> storyboard work prior. Seeking insight, Lasseter and Docter attended a three-day seminar in Los Angeles given by McKee. His principles, grounded in Aristotle's Poetics, dictated that a character emerges most realistically and compellingly from the choices that the protagonist makes in reaction to his problems. Disney also appointed Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow and, later, Joss Whedon to help develop the script. Whedon found that the script wasn't working but had a great structure, and added the character of Rex and sought a pivotal role for Barbie. The story team continued to touch up the script as production was underway. Among the late additions was the encounter between Buzz and the alien squeaky toys at Pizza Planet, which emerged from a brainstorming session with a dozen directors, story artists, and animators from Disney.|$|E

25|$|All {{group members}} were {{expected}} to work in common for the settlement. The women did domestic chores, while the men worked the farm <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> prospecting for gold, {{on a small scale}} and without much success. Water was scarce, but they installed a windmill-driven water pump and concrete cisterns for irrigating their fields. Members constructed the buildings themselves. There was no electricity or indoor plumbing, consistent with their belief in material simplicity. They also made their own furniture and household goods by hand, supplemented by Ogden's occasional shopping trips to Monticello. Despite this spartan existence, the colony continually added new members, the population growing to around 100 at its height in 19345.|$|E

25|$|In {{another version}} of the myth, Goram dug the Avon Gorge himself {{and there is no}} sign of Vincent in the story. Having {{completed}} the job, he carelessly fell over a barrow called Maes Knoll, on Dundry Hill south of Bristol, and plunged into the Severn estuary, as above. In yet another, Vincent and Goram shared a pickaxe as they went about their labours, and Vincent accidentally killed Goram by throwing it to him inaccurately halfway through their respective jobs. Vincent finished the Avon Gorge out of remorse <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> other major construction work like the Stanton Drew stone circles and even Stonehenge. One or the other giant is said to have created Maes Knoll hillfort and the pre-Anglo-Saxon period linear earthwork Wansdyke, south-east of Bristol, more or less accidentally with his digging tools. There are other variants.|$|E
25|$|After {{some initial}} studies with {{composer}} Rubin Goldmark, Copland traveled to Paris, where he first studied with Isidor Philipp and Paul Vidal, then with noted pedagogue Nadia Boulanger. He studied {{three years with}} Boulanger, whose eclectic approach to music inspired his own broad taste. Determined upon {{his return to the}} U.S. to make his way as a full-time composer, Copland gave lecture-recitals, wrote works on commission <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> teaching and writing. He found composing orchestral music in the modernist style he had adapted abroad a financially contradictory approach, particularly in light of the Great Depression. He shifted in the mid-1930s to a more accessible musical style which mirrored the German idea of Gebrauchsmusik ("music for use"), music that could serve utilitarian and artistic purposes. During the Depression years, he traveled extensively to Europe, Africa, and Mexico, formed an important friendship with Mexican composer Carlos Chávez and began composing his signature works.|$|E
