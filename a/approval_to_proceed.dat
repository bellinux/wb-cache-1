2500|$|Ibn Abi Du'ad {{remained}} highly influential under al-Mu'tasim's son and successor al-Wathiq (r. 842–847), who similarly {{maintained the}} doctrine that the Qur'an had been created.

[...] With the accession of al-Wathiq, however, the new caliph ordered that the severity of the mihnah be increased, giving advocates of the inquisition <b>approval</b> <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> with vigor. At the beginning of al-Wathiq's reign, Ibn Abi Du'ad appointed several new qadis to Baghdad who supported the mihnah, and in the provinces there was a marked increase of persecutions against individuals who were considered dissenters. In 845 the mihnah was even extended to Muslim prisoners held by the Byzantines, when Ibn Abi Du'ad sent an agent to test their opinion on Qur'anic createdness and ransomed only those who supported it, leaving those who did not in Byzantine custody.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the Israel National Oil Company (INOC) was granted shaft-sinking permits in the Golan Heights. It {{estimated}} a recovery potential of two {{million barrels of}} oil, equivalent {{at the time to}} $24 million. During the Yitzhak Rabin administration (1992–1995), the permits were suspended as efforts were undertaken to restart peace negotiations between Israel and Syria. In 1996, Benjamin Netanyahu granted preliminary <b>approval</b> <b>to</b> INOC <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> with oil exploration drilling in the Golan. INOC began undergoing a process of privatization in 1997, overseen by then-Director of the Government Companies Authority (GCA), Tzipi Livni.

In 2012, National Infrastructure Minister Uzi Landau approved exploratory drilling for oil and natural gas in the Golan. The following year, the Petroleum Council of Israel's Ministry of Energy and Water Resources secretly awarded a drilling license covering half the area of the Golan Heights to a local subsidiary of New Jersey-based Genie Energy Ltd. headed by Effi Eitam.|$|R
30|$|In comparison, {{although}} it was installed by a state-owned electricity distribution company, representatives of the Majan solar rooftop project have indicated difficulties in receiving approval for the project from the incumbent regime actors in the AER. Project approval was mainly delayed, {{because there is no}} element in the power sector law supporting the uptake of renewables, and the licensed electricity distribution companies are not allowed to generate their own electricity or source electricity from any providers other than the sole state-owned electricity provider in the country, Oman Power and Water Procurement company (interview 4).

40|$|The US ITER Project Office (USIPO) is {{responsible}} for the ITER central solenoid (CS) contribution to the ITER project. The Central Solenoid Insert (CSI) project will allow ITER validation the appropriate lengths of the conductors {{to be used in the}} full-scale CS coils under relevant conditions. The ITER Program plans to build and test a CSI to verify the performance of the CS conductor. The CSI is a one-layer solenoid with an inner diameter of 1. 48 m and a height of 4. 45 m between electric terminal ends. The coil weight with the terminals is approximately 820 kg without insulation. The major goal of the CSI is to measure the temperature margin of the CS under the ITER direct current (DC) operating conditions, including determining sensitivity to load cycles. Performance of the joints, ramp rate sensitivity, and stability against thermal or electromagnetic disturbances, electrical insulation, losses, and instrumentation are addressed separately and therefore are not major goals in this project. However, losses and joint performance will be tested during the CSI testing campaign. The USIPO will build the CSI that will be tested at the Central Solenoid Model Coil (CSMC) Test Facility at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), Naka, Japan. The industrial vendors (the Suppliers) will report to the USIPO (the Company). All <b>approvals</b> <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> will be issued by the Company, which in some cases, as specified in this document, will also require the approval of the ITER Organization. Responsibilities and obligations will be covered by respective contracts between the USIPO, called Company interchangeably, and the industrial Prime Contractors, called Suppliers. Different stages of work may be performed by more than one Prime Contractor, as described in this specification. Technical requirements of the contract between the Company and the Prime Contractor will be covered by the Fabrication Specifications developed by the Prime Contractor based on this document and approved by the Company and ITER. The Fabrication Specifications may reflect some national requirements and regulations that are not fully provided here. This document presents the ITER CSI specifications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Osborne Mine is an {{underground}} copper-gold operation in Northern Queensland that mines an ironstone deposit which hosts magnetite and silica with chalcopyrite, pyrite, and pyrrhotite. The mine setting is arid {{with the majority}} of make-up water being supplied from boreholes located {{on the edge of the}} Great Artesian Basin, some 28 km away. The development and implementation of thickened discharge for tailings management was initially motivated on the basis of potential water savings as well as the potential to reduce wall raising costs on the tailings dam. As trials progressed however, it became apparent that thickened discharge would not only achieve these but also would enable reductions in operating costs, improved rehabilitation potential, and more efficient use of available storage capacity. This paper describes the development and implementation of thickened discharge at Osborne. The operating strategy and the operating cost savings that have been realised are discussed, as is the design philosophy for a new tailings storage facility to accommodate the new method of deposition. The economic, geotechnical and rehabilitation assessments necessary <b>to</b> obtain regulatory <b>approvals</b> and <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> with this method of deposition on a long term basis are also detailed...|$|R
