40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the most common nursing diagnoses in chronic renal patients using as reference Imogene King's Conceptual System, which describes the three systems that form the basis for her model: personal, interpersonal and social. A data collecting tool with a supervised follow up was applied to 20 patients in a unit of dialysis in order to verify the patients' needs. The diagnoses were determined according to NANDA's Taxonomy II. In 50 % or more of the chronic renal clients nursing diagnoses were: risk of infection, altered protection and <b>altered</b> <b>comfort...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{identified}} the demographic profile, obstetric and clinical diagnoses, nursing diagnosis and most common collaboration problem among pregnant women subject to high-risk {{at a hospital}} in São Paulo, Brazil. Data were collected by means of a form based on Gordon's Functional Health Patterns. Nursing diagnoses were determined {{on the basis of the}} NANDA (North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) taxonomy. The nursing diagnoses found in 50 % or more of the pregnant women were: risk for infection (90. 1 %), altered health maintenance (84. 5 %), <b>altered</b> <b>comfort</b> (80. 3 %), risk of ineffective breastfeeding (59. 2 %), altered sexuality patterns (52. 1 %), fear (52. 1 %) and pain (50. 7 %). The collaboration problem found in 50 % or more of the cases was: potential complication: preterm labor (62. 0 %), potential complication: maternal tachycardia (54, 9 %) and potential complication: hypotension (54, 9 %). Thus, these results will allow us to guide the nursing care rendered to these pregnant women...|$|E

40|$|Patients who {{are dying}} of cancer usually give up eating and then stop drinking. This raises ethical {{dilemmas}} about providing nutritional support and fluid replacement. The decision-making process {{should be based on}} a knowledge of the risks and benefits of giving or withholding treatments. There is no clear evidence that increased nutritional support or fluid therapy <b>alters</b> <b>comfort,</b> mental status or survival of patients {{who are dying}}. Rarely, subcutaneous fluid administration in the dying patient may be justified if the family remain distressed despite due consideration of the lack of medical benefit versus the risks. Some cancer patients who are not imminently dying become dehydrated from reversible conditions such as hypercalcaemia. This may mimic the effects of advanced cancer. These conditions should be sought and fluid replacement therapy should be given along with the specific treatments for the condition...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{peripheral}} electrical stimulation on tooth pain threshold and comfort of oral soft tissue was evaluated in 30 children, using a double-blind, crossover, study design. Tooth pain threshold was measured {{before and after}} 8 minutes of electrical or sham stimulation. Comfort of oral soft tissue during placement of a rubber dam clamp was evaluated 3 minutes after electrical or sham stimulation was begun. Comfort level was rated by each subject and by the investigator, using a visual analog scale (VAS). Heart rate was measured before and immediately following placement of the clamp. Electrical stimulation significantly increased tooth pain threshold and reduced the cardiovascular stress response without <b>altering</b> <b>comfort</b> levels during placement of the clamp. These findings suggest that peripheral electrical stimulation applied in a pediatric dental setting alters sensory aspects of pain but not affective aspects of comfort...|$|R

30|$|Introduction: Sedation and {{analgesia}} {{is one of}} {{the basic}} themes in ICU as complications associated with excessive sedation negatively impact the morbidity and mortality of patients. The objective {{of this study is to}} show that the nurse implementation of a sedation and analgesia algorithm is beneficial to the patient in terms of sedative drugs reduction and thus overall decrease in duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and the morbidity and mortality which is associated with it, without <b>altering</b> patient <b>comfort</b> and tolerance of the environment.|$|R
30|$|Results: Eighty-eight {{patients}} were analyzed. The mean {{note in the}} comfort scale remained unchanged after vs. before drain removal in patients without HA (n =  43, + 0.04 points, ±  2.8), while it increased in patients with HA (n =  45, + 2.07, ±  2.7  + p =  0.001). Using our specific five item comfort score, patients and caregivers had a comparable level of satisfaction in HA and non-HA groups (Patients 17.4 20 and 16.3 20  + caregivers— 19 20 in both). A trend was observed in reduction of the consumption of morphine and Nitrous Oxid with HA, without <b>altering</b> their <b>comfort.</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} hardness and posting of orthoses on plantar profile and perceived comfort and support during cycling. Design: A repeated measures study with randomised order of orthoses, hardness, and posting conditions. Methods: Twenty-three cyclists cycled at a cadence of 90 rpm and a perceived exertion rating of twelve. Contoured soft and hard orthoses {{with or without a}} medial forefoot or lateral forefoot post were evaluated. Plantar contact area, mean pressure and peak pressure were measured for nine plantar regions using the pedar-X system and represented {{as a percentage of the}} total (CA%, MP%, and PP% respectively). Perceived comfort and support was rated on a visual analogue scale. Results: The softer orthosis significantly increased CA% (p = 0. 014) across the midfoot and heel with a decrease in the toe region and forefoot. MP% (p = 0. 034) and PP% (p = 0. 012) were significantly increased at the mid and lateral forefoot with reductions in MP% at the midfoot and in PP% at the hallux and toes. Forefoot posting significantly increased CA% (p = 0. 018) at the toes and forefoot and decreased it at the heel. PP% was significantly altered (p = 0. 013) based on posting position. Lateral forefoot posting significantly decreased heel comfort (p = 0. 036). Conclusion: When cycling, a soft, contoured orthosis increased contact across the midfoot and heel, modulating forefoot and midfoot plantar pressures but not <b>altering</b> <b>comfort</b> or support. Forefoot postings significantly modified contact areas and plantar pressures and reduced comfort at the heel...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Person {{sitting on}} a {{suspended}} seat, which is excited by floor motion (f. e. truck cab floor), plays a passive {{as well as an}} active role in influencing own vibratory motion. Transmissibility of the floor vibration to a person, occupying a suspended seat, differs therefore vastly from transmissibility of the floor vibration to a passive seat load. Identification of these human reactions could be important, as it could <b>alter</b> vibratory <b>comfort</b> criteria as well as demands on active control of suspended seats. Some hints for further research, which could lead to the identification of force reactions of a person {{sitting on a}} suspended seat excited by vibratory floor motion, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{sensation}} {{experienced by}} a subject in a confined environment is significantly {{affected by the}} radiative heat exchange between {{the human body and}} the surrounding surfaces: it contributes as far as 30 % of the whole thermal exchanges of the subject. Besides, the presence of high-intensity radiation sources like, for example, the sun, may appreciably modify the radiant field to which people are exposed. As a consequence, this could <b>alter</b> notably the <b>comfort</b> conditions. In order of properly taking into account this issue, a simple analytical method is introduced in this work, that allows the easy evaluation of the thermal radiant field induced by the presence of the solar radiation. An application to a typical thermal comfort computation is finally presented...|$|R
40|$|Light is an {{important}} factor in creating a comfortable and pleasant environment. This does not solely depend on visual information, but also on non-visual effects of light like its influence on alertness, mood, sleep-wake rhythm and wellbeing (e. g. van Bommel, 2006). It is likely that light also plays a role in thermoregulation and may affect thermal comfort. Thermal comfort is a major factor regarding satisfaction with the indoor environment. However, the relation and interaction between light, thermoregulation and thermal comfort is not fully known. Light is a key factor to regulate the circadian system, thereby controlling core body- and skin temperature cycles (Cajochen et al., 2005). Bright light in the evening can increase both core body temperature and the distal to proximal skin temperature gradient (Kim and Tokura, 2007). Additionally, the hue of light seems to be able to <b>alter</b> thermal <b>comfort.</b> The environment may be perceived as warmer under reddish light and cooler under bluish light (Albers et al., 2014). Yet it is unknown whether these effects of lights are of practical significance to improve thermal comfort. Moreover, knowledge on the role of timing, duration, intensity and colour of the light exposure is missing. The main objective of this study is to investigate the relation between light, thermoregulation and thermal comfort. Furthermore, we will explore how this knowledge can contribute to comfortable and healthy buildings. Therefore, the effects of bright and dim light on thermoregulation, human energy expenditure, thermal comfort and alertness will be studied...|$|R
40|$|Background: For {{patients}} with limited English profi-ciency, reports show improved health care outcomes when physicians are proficient {{in the language}} spoken by the patient. Formal language assessment has been explored {{as an effort to}} ensure language concordance, and it may be a valuable tool for helping medical stu-dents become bilingual health care providers. Objective: We assess current student interest in im-proving second language skills, self-reported language proficiency, and the effects of formal language assess-ment on the level of comfort with using this second language in a variety of clinical scenarios. Design: Mixed design including 1) cross-sectional baseline survey and 2) a randomized subgroup selected for intervention with formal language assessment and follow-up, using within-subjects analysis. 132 medical student volunteers completed an initial survey, 50 of which were randomly selected to complete a formal language assessment and a follow-up survey. Interventions: Spanish formal language assessment was utilized by telephone survey provided and assessed by Versant™. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported interest in becoming a bilingual health care provider, self-re-ported language proficiency, formally-assessed lan-guage proficiency, preferred modalities for learning a second language, and comfort level with using a sec-ond language in a variety of clinical scenarios. Results: Self-reported proficiency rating was correlat-ed with overall scores on formal assessment. Formal assessment did not <b>alter</b> reported <b>comfort</b> level with using a second language except in proficient/fluent stu-dents. These students reported a decrease in comfort with providing care in scenarios that are complex (3. 72 to 3. 41, p= 0. 005) and those that have medical-legal implications (3. 72 to 3. 44, p= 0. 05).

40|$|When {{exercise}} is undertaken in warm, humid conditions, the thermal gradient between {{the skin and}} environment, and the capacity for evaporative heat loss, are reduced. These factors, along {{with an increase in}} metabolic heat production, lower work capacity and exercise performance. Thermoreceptors located within the skin and deep in the body convey information on this accumulation of thermal energy to higher brain structures and, if mean body temperature rises uncontrollably, the cumulative neuronal input is thought to produce inhibitory signals that lower work capacity, such that metabolic heat production decreases to protect the organism from heat injury. Lessening these inhibitory signals may enhance or help to maintain exercise performance in the heat. The inhibitory signals might be lessened by cooling the skin and deep body temperature prior to or during exercise, or perhaps by applying menthol on the skin, or some combination of these. Menthol is a chemical compound that activates cold receptors (TRPM 8) in the skin to elicit cool sensations. These receptors are not otherwise activated unless cooled below 27 °C. Hence, menthol, when applied to the skin of heat stressed humans, may provide a “cool’’ neuronal input to higher brain structures in addition to the neuronal signals arising from warm thermoreceptors located within the body. But menthol may also induce a heat storage (cold defense) response that would then heighten the activity of warm receptors deep in the body. Therefore, {{it is not clear whether}} menthol might reduce, enhance or help to maintain exercise performance in heat stressed humans. Moreover, no studies have assessed the perceptual and thermoregulatory response to menthol during rest or exercise, or the consequence of its repeated use. Before it is recommended as a possible ergogenic aid, these studies should be undertaken. The early work presented in this thesis tested the hypotheses that a water-based spray, containing ethanol and/or menthol, would enhance evaporative cooling when sprayed on the skin, thereby lowering heat storage and improving thermal perception compared to an unsprayed Control condition; but menthol would also improve thermal perception independent of temperature by directly stimulating cold receptors, during rest and exercise in warm, humid conditions. The hypothesis that menthol-mediated cool sensations would not undergo any habituation after repeated exposures was also tested. The general approach to testing these hypotheses involved presenting human participants with a thermal challenge that would induce warm sensations and increase thermal discomfort, whilst encouraging a level of heat storage that could be compensated for by increasing heat loss through v sodilation and sweating. This was achieved by manipulating metabolic heat production through a combination of rest and fixed intensity exercise in warm (30 °C) and humid (70 %) conditions. The influence of a menthol solution spray was tested against the backdrop of this thermal challenge. The results supported the general hypothesis that a water-based upper-body spray containing menthol can increase sensations of coolth compared to no spraying or wateronly spraying during rest and exercise in warm, humid conditions, but menthol also influences body temperature regulation. The effect that menthol exerts over perception and thermoregulation differs by dose and fades with time. Specifically, 0. 2 % menthol spraying encourages heat storage by enhancing vasoconstriction, and there is no habituation in these responses. 0. 05 % menthol spraying did not encourage any additional heat storage compared to a Control spray. Menthol also influenced perception, with a 0. 2 % menthol spray promoting cooler sensations and greater irritation than 0. 05 % menthol and Control spraying. Compared to a Control spray, 0. 2 % menthol reduced thermal comfort during rest and improved it during exercise, while 0. 05 % menthol did not <b>alter</b> thermal <b>comfort</b> during rest, and may have improved it during exercise. Neither menthol spray influenced perceived exertion during exercise. Menthol-mediated cool sensations lasted 15 to 30 minutes. Both 0. 2 % and 0. 05 % menthol sprays underwent an habituation compared to the Control spray, with cool sensations diminishing after repeated daily exposures. It is concluded that a 0. 05 % menthol spray, which induces cool sensations without a significant heat storage response, could be considered as a perceptual cooling intervention with some capacity to enhance evaporative heat loss when sprayed on the skin during rest and moderate fixed-intensity exercise in the heat. A 0. 2 % menthol spray might be deployed later in exercise, but may increase heat storage and irritation. Further testing is required to identify whether menthol spraying improves maximal exercise performance. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The whole thesis was {{designed}} to investigate the relationship between energy efficiency and thermal comfort {{with regard to the}} way heat distribution in the passive house as well as control efficiency. In order to verify the assumed also performed simulations in the IDA Indoor Climate and Energy, which is a modern tool for simulation. 	When conducting the analysis of the influence, founded the air temperature in the building, the impact of heat distribution method, as well as closing the door openings and pipe insulation, on energy efficiency and thermal comfort in the test building (located in Trondheim, Norway). Considered temperature situations were divided into: - Stable temperature equal to 21 ºC - Room temperature variable during the day - during the day and hour 7 am to 11 pm, the temperature is 21 degrees whereas at night - would fall to 19 degrees. - The last case, the most complicated, similarly as in the previous case that varies in temperature during the day, but in addition, during the year (at Christmas - 25. 12 to 31. 12), the temperature would drop to 16 degrees because of the absence inhabitants. 	Among the above-mentioned objectives in terms of comfort, most preferably dropped situation where temperature change followed only during the day. The most unfavorable in this respect {{turned out to be an}} option with the temperature at a constant level. 	The most efficient option is to maintain a constant air temperature in the room. This is due to the increased energy demand, which occurs when you need to increase the temperature from 19 ºC (night) to 21 ºC (day). 	Another factor that could have a potential impact on thermal comfort and energy efficiency model was the way the distribution of heat in the building. Two possibilities were taken into consideration: - Standard system - where one radiator falls on one room, two-pipe system - Simplified layout - lines also carried out a two-pipe system, and the heaters are located one on the floor. 	With the introduction of this assumption, it turned out that a change in the distribution of heat does not have too much impact on <b>altering</b> perception of <b>comfort</b> but only if we make the assumption unhindered flow of air masses (warm) between the two rooms. Otherwise (assuming no heat flow) streamlined solution causes a strong feeling of thermal discomfort caused by excessive fluctuations in temperature between the rooms. This is where there is the need to adopt and verify the assumptions next - door open / closed. 	The last inspected the condition insulate distribution lines to the radiator heating medium. In the absence of pipe insulation heat loss to the environment they were almost twice as high as when the pipes were insulated. This could affect the feeling of comfort in the case of high-temperature heating. 	Based on these studies it was concluded that the best solution due to thermal comfort, energy efficiency, and even the economic aspect is to simplify the heating distribution system with mandatory leaving the door open and establish a constant temperature equal to 21 ºC in the analyzed object...|$|R
