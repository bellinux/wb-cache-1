40|$|Scannerless (flash) {{lidar system}} based on streak camera is able to realize {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) multi-spectral fluorescence imaging and 3 D imaging polarimetry. Compared with conventional lidar system, the flash lidar system overcomes image distortions caused by the motion between the target and the sensor platform. Other advantages of the flash lidar system are higher image update rates {{and the potential for}} creating a miniaturized lidar system. To meet the requirements for developing this new technology, a super small-sized, large photocathode area and meshless streak tube with spherical cathode and screen is designed with the aid of computer simulation technology (CST) software. The tube with nearly 28 mm wide photocathode work area contains two electrostatic focusing lens, a pair of deflection plates, and a 50 mm diameter output screen. The external dimension of the tube is merely 50 mm x 100 mm. And its electromagnetic fields are calculated in the CST Particle Studio based on the finite integration theory. Some dynamic properties of the tube are analyzed via observing different electron trajectories launched from a number of different points on the cathode. The influences of the deflector position on deflection sensitivity and spatial resolution are analyzed. Increasing the distance between the deflector and the <b>anode</b> <b>pin</b> hole leads to a worse deflection sensitivity but a better spatial resolution. As for the temporal resolution, three electron pulses separated by 30 ps can be well resolved by the streak tube in the dynamic mode. Thus, the dynamic temporal resolution of the streak tube is better than 30 ps. And a 10 lp/mm spatial resolution across the 28 mm long slit on the photocathode can be obtained by estimating modulation transfer functions of the electron trajectories. Temporal distortions at the entire photocathode working area are evaluated, and the data reveal that the larger the photocathode working area, the bigger the temporal distortions are. Also, the temporal distortion is present mainly in the photocathode-to-deflection plates region. In addition, the slit image of the streak tube working in the dynamic mode is simulated and presented. The phenomenon that the slit image is curved due to the temporal distortion is analyzed. Two rectangular electron pulses separated by 50 ps are well resolved by the streak tube. Therefore, the temporal resolution of this small-size steak tube is better than 50 ps with a rectangular slit dimension of 30 mm x 50 mu m on the photocathode, and its electron-optic magnification is 1. 2...|$|E
40|$|Pin tract {{infection}} is a prevalent complication in treatments with external fixation. This {{study focused on}} the external fixation utilized for the knee joint distraction treatment. In a previous study initiated by the UMC Utrecht 85 % of the patients got at least one pin tract infection during this treatment. A pin tract {{infection is}} caused by bacteria (mainly staphylococci) that form a biofilm {{on the surface of}} the external fixation pin. Currently, antibiotics are used to treat pin tract infections. High doses of antibiotics are needed to resolve a biofilm. Prevention of biofilm development is necessary to minimize the antibiotic use. The literature suggested that a small electric current could have an influence on the biofilm formation and therewith the chance of infection. The first aim of this study was to investigate the effect of three different current heights (20, 100 and 500 µA) on the bacteria on the surface of external fixation pins. The secondary aim was to develop a wearable device for the knee joint distraction treatment that could deliver this current to the pin tract. Results from the experiments showed that: it was possible to form a starting biofilm in 24 hours with Staphylococcus aureus on an external fixation pin and an electric current decreases the amount of viable bacteria on the pin and in the fluid surrounding it. The amplitude of the current had an influence on the extent to which the bacteria were killed. The ratio of viable bacteria {{on the surface of the}} <b>anode</b> <b>pins</b> was: 1 out of 18 (20 µA), 1 out of 200 (100 µA) and 1 out of 11 (500 µA). On the surface of the cathode pins this was: the same as control (20 µA), 1 out of 12 (100 µA) and zero (500 µA). In the fluids the ratio of viable bacteria were: 1 out of 9 (20 µA), 1 out of 10. 000 (100 µA) and 1 out of 100. 000 (500 µA). A different process was observed on the <b>anode</b> <b>pins</b> than on the cathode pins. A current of 500 µA was used in the developed prototypes of a wearable device. One of the two prototypes tested in-vitro, successfully killed bacteria and prevented biofilm formation on the surface of the external fixator pins. The developed wearable device has the potential to make pin tract infection a rare complication during the use of external fixation for the knee joint distraction treatment.

40|$|The {{effects of}} cathode material, cathode {{operating}} temperature, anode configuration, window materials, and hydrogen additives on laser lifetime are determined. Internally oxidized copper and silber-copper alloy cathodes were tested. The cathode operating temperature {{was raised in}} some tubes {{through the use of}} thermal insulation. Lasers incorporating thermally insulated silver copper oxide cathodes clearly yielded the longest lifetimes-typically in excess of 22, 000 hours. The use of platinum sheet versus platinum <b>pin</b> <b>anodes</b> had no observable effect on laser lifetime. Similarly, the choice of germanium, cadmium telluride, or zinc selenide as the optical window material appears to have no impact on lifetime...|$|R
30|$|After electrophoresis, {{the excess}} alkali is {{neutralized}} with Tris buffer (0.4  M, pH  7.5). When neutralization step occur, extruded DNA (single and double strand breaks) which are migrate towards <b>anode,</b> formed hair <b>pin</b> loop like structure. And when it stained with DNA binding dye, dye molecules are intercalate in between loop of extruded DNA and become visualized under fluorescent microscope. In the staining, slides are stained with {{any one of}} the DNA binding dye (Ethidium Bromide, Propidium Iodide, DAPI or YOYO) and stored in a humidified slide box until scored (Paul and Bhattacharya 2012). Ethidium Bromide is most commonly used DNA binding dye in the Comet assay.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{and testing of}} a soft x-ray gas pixel detector, which uses connector <b>pins</b> for the <b>anodes</b> is reported. Based on a commercial 100 pin connector block, a prototype detector of aperture 25. 4 mm x 25. 4 mm can be economically fabricated. The individual <b>pin</b> <b>anodes</b> all show the expected characteristics of small gas detectors capable of counting rates reaching 1 MHz per pin. A 2 -dimensional resistive divide readout system has been developed to permit the imaging properties of the detector to be explored in advance of true pixel readout electronics.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} new designs of Schottky, JBS and PiN diodes, which process {{technology}} {{is compatible with}} that of vertical power SiC JFETs. Three novel diode designs are proposed and we report their electrical characteristics. The P+ buried layer implant of the JFET {{is used for the}} <b>PiN</b> <b>anode</b> formation and for the P+ islands of the JBS. The Schottky diode differs from a standard Schottky diode since buried rings below the Schottky contact region have been included and the anode metal layer also contacts the buried P+ region at the diode periphery. With this last approach, the resulting Schottky diodes show low leakage currents and surge current capability, with a lower on-state voltage than the JBS...|$|R
40|$|Electro-osmotic {{dewatering}} (EOD) of 9. 1 wt % bentonite slurry {{was investigated}} using a stationary and rotating anode. The rotational speed varied from 0 to 300 rpm. Excessive slurry {{is necessary to}} load beyond the anode initially to maintain good contact between the anode and the dewatered slurry. The water removed from the slurry increased significantly with the rotational speed initially and reached a plateau at 240 rpm. This increase {{is found to be}} due to the "falling off" of the dry cake from the rotating anode. The average solid content of the cake in the chamber after EOD can be 24. 6 wt % with the anode rotating at 240 rpm and 3 times excessive initial loading of slurry. This solid content is 70. 8 % higher than that obtained using a stationary stainless steel <b>anode.</b> When a <b>pin</b> was inserted beneath the rotating anode, an optimal cake thickness of 5 mm was found in terms of water removal. The energy consumption for the process is < 20 % of the latent heat of water evaporation...|$|R
40|$|A {{high power}} HBr {{chemical}} laser {{was designed and}} constructed to give the maximum output energy and peak power of 1. 4 J and 1 MW, respectively, in multiline operation. The laser tube is 6 m long employing a pin-type TE shower discharge between bar <b>anodes</b> and 8000 <b>pin</b> cathodes. The effective discharge volume {{is estimated to be}} two liters. With addition of Ar buffer gas, the laser energy became almost twice as much as that in Br 2 + H 2 mixture. For single line operation with a Littrow mounted grating, twenty-nine lines of P 10 (1) - P 10 (10), P 21 (l) - P 21 (5), P 21 (7) - P 21 (11) and P 32 (3) - P 32 (11) were observed in the wavelengths ranging from 3. 934 µm 4. 586 µm. Seven lines of them, P 10 (1), P 10 (2), P 10 (3), P 21 (1), P 21 (2), P 21 (3) and P 32 (11) were observed for the first time.
