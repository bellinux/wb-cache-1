5|$|The spines of cacti {{are often}} useful in identification, since they vary greatly between species in number, color, size, shape and hardness, {{as well as}} in whether all the spines {{produced}} by an areole are similar or whether they are of distinct kinds. Most spines <b>are</b> <b>straight</b> or at most slightly curved, and are described as hair-like, bristle-like, needle-like or awl-like, depending on their length and thickness. Some cacti have flattened spines (e.g. Schlerocactus papyracanthus). Other cacti have hooked spines. Sometimes, one or more central spines are hooked, while outer spines <b>are</b> <b>straight</b> (e.g., Mammillaria rekoi).|$|E

40|$|A metric space X <b>is</b> called <b>straight</b> if any {{continuous}} real-valued function {{which is}} uniformly continuous on {{each set of}} a finite cover of X by closed sets, is itself uniformly continuous.

5|$|Epiacum is in {{some ways}} a typical Roman fort: inside the wall <b>are</b> <b>straight</b> roads which cross, a {{headquarters}} building (the Praetorium), the commandant's house, a set of barrack blocks for the cohort of auxiliary soldiers, and granaries to store food. Also as usual, there is a bath house and a temple (dedicated by the auxiliaries to the Emperor Caracalla) outside the wall. There is an altar to Mithras and another, as already mentioned, to Hercules.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, George {{published}} a revised arrangement that placed B.attenuata in the subgenus Banksia {{because of its}} flower spike, section Banksia because its styles <b>are</b> <b>straight</b> rather than hooked, and the series Cyrtostylis, a large and rather heterogenous series of twelve species. He conceded its large emarginate cotyledons (having a notch in their apex) were quite different from other members, {{and that it had}} similarities in flower architecture to another anomalous member B.elegans. He felt B.attenuata to have affinities to B.lindleyana and B.media.|$|E

5|$|In the skull, {{it has a}} {{significantly}} longer rostrum (the front part of the skull) and diastema (the gap between the incisors and the molars). Furthermore, it has shorter molar rows in both {{the upper and lower}} jaws. The back end of the incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate), which is located in front of the first molars, is rounded in eastern voalavo, but angular in northern voalavo. The sutures of the maxillary and palatine bones (the line where the two bones, part of the skull, join) <b>are</b> <b>straight</b> and parallel to each other, the toothrows, and the midline of the skull in eastern voalavo. Northern voalavo, in contrast, are more curved. Statistical analysis of measurements of the skull and teeth clearly separates the two species of Voalavo.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact {{dog that}} gives the {{impression}} of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs <b>are</b> <b>straight</b> and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.|$|E

5|$|The {{anamorphic}} form of P.semilanceata is an asexual {{stage in}} the fungus's life cycle involved {{in the development of}} mitotic diaspores (conidia). In culture, grown in a petri dish, the fungus forms a white to pale orange cottony or felt-like mat of mycelia. The conidia formed <b>are</b> <b>straight</b> to curved, measuring 2.0–8.0 by 1.1–2.0μm, and may contain one to several small intracellular droplets. Although little is known of the anamorphic stage of P.semilanceata beyond the confines of laboratory culture, in general, the morphology of the asexual structures may be used as classical characters in phylogenetic analyses to help understand the evolutionary relationships between related groups of fungi.|$|E
5|$|The long tail of Kentrosaurus {{results in}} a {{position}} of the center of mass that is unusually far back for a quadrupedal animal. It rests {{just in front of the}} hip, a position usually seen in bipedal dinosaurs. However, the femora <b>are</b> <b>straight</b> in Kentrosaurus, as opposed to typical bipeds, indicating a straight and vertical limb position. Thus, the hindlimbs, though powered by massive thigh muscles attached to a long ilium, did not support the animal alone, and the very robust forelimbs took up 10 to 15% of the bodyweight.|$|E
5|$|The front root {{is larger}} than the back one. In side view, the upper and back margins <b>are</b> <b>straight,</b> but the front margin is convex. There are eight cusps {{arranged}} in a row on the upper margin, the first of which is located about one third of the tooth's length from the front margin. Only the last is slightly worn, indicating that the tooth is from a young animal. Long ridges extend from the cusps diagonally toward the front on both the lingual and labial (outer) sides of the tooth. The first seven ridges on both sides are connected to the respective cusps, but the eighth ridges do not quite reach their cusp. On both sides of the tooth, there is also a small ridge behind the eighth ridge that extends to the back margin; these ridges are called the posterolabial and posterolingual ridge. An even smaller ridge is located below the ridge on the lingual side.|$|E

5|$|Krause {{and colleagues}} {{identified}} two teeth, MACN Pv-RN 249 and 250, as anterior upper premolars. 249 bears two longitudinal rows of cusps. One row (row A; possibly the lingual one) includes four cusps, the other (row B) includes at least two, but is damaged. In row A, {{there are three}} ridges (at the front, middle, and back) extending {{from the tip of}} the base of each cusp. The second and third cusps are largest and most widely separated from each other. In row B, one cusp bears three ridges, of which one extends towards the other cusp in the row and the two others towards row A) and the other cusp is damaged. 250 is more fragmentary, but bears at least five cusps and may represent the same tooth position as 249, though it would come from {{the opposite side of the}} mouth. The microstructure of the enamel of this tooth has been studied. With a width of about 55μm near the tip of a cusp, the enamel is thin. The enamel prisms <b>are</b> <b>straight,</b> small, and rounded and there is little material between the prisms. Small, rounded prisms are also seen in Gondwanatherium, Sudamerica, and other gondwanatheres, but in few multituberculates. Even in those multituberculates that do have small prisms, the prism sheath is closed, but the sheath is incomplete in Gondwanatherium and possibly Ferugliotherium.|$|E
5|$|The single known tooth, a worn left upper molar {{known as}} T Li 175, is large for a treeshrew, with {{a length of}} 3.57mm and width of 4.79mm. Although Mein and Ginsburg {{described}} it a second upper molar (M2), Ni and Qiu argued in 2012 {{that it is more}} likely a first upper molar (M1). It is dilambdodont (with a W-shaped chewing surface) and the labial surface (the side of the cheeks) is concave and bears a cingular crest. A well-developed small cusp, a mesostyle, is present on the labial side. The presence of the mesostyle distinguishes the animal from Ptilocercus, {{the only member of the}} treeshrew family Ptilocercidae. The lingual (tongue) side is narrow. A large cusp, the protocone, is on the front lingual corner. Two crests descend from it; one reaches the paracone on the front labial side and another approaches the metacone to the back of the tooth. A smaller cusp, a hypocone, is on the back lingual corner. This feature distinguishes T.miocenica both from the treeshrew genera Dendrogale, Prodendrogale, and Palaeotupaia, which lack the cusp entirely, and from Anathana and Urogale, which have a large hypocone. In T.miocenica the back and lingual sides of the hypocone <b>are</b> <b>straight</b> and form a right angle with each other. The tooth most closely resembles Tupaia species with a simple mesostyle, such as the common treeshrew (Tupaia glis). However, this species is smaller and unlike in T. miocenica, the hypocone is not isolated from the protocone by a narrow valley.|$|E
5|$|The thighbone is {{straight}} in front view. Seen {{from the same}} direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At {{the lower end of}} the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They <b>are</b> <b>straight</b> and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.|$|E
