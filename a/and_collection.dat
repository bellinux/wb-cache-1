40|$|The International Committee for University Museums <b>and</b> <b>Collections</b> (UMAC) {{identifies}} <b>and</b> {{enhances the}} strengths of university museums <b>and</b> <b>collections.</b> To do this, UMAC must find ground common to all the museums <b>and</b> <b>collections</b> in the sector. There is {{a dizzying array of}} fields of interest, sizes, staff, resources, ages and reputations. Seeing this variety, one gets the same sort of feelings as looking at the bright night sky in the countryside—feelings of wonder, confusion, fascination, variety, timelessness, futurity, life and belonging. Universities are simultaneously places of the old and new, of the ephemeral and the permanent, of the material and immaterial. Despite such diversity, university museums <b>and</b> <b>collections</b> are places where past heritage can, for the benefit of society, interact with current thoughts and ideas. All university museums can establish meaningful links across disciplines and between communities. In this paper, I present some metaphors concerning the role of university museums <b>and</b> <b>collections</b> <b>and</b> explain why UMAC makes a difference to the future of both museums and individuals...|$|R

5|$|A {{major element}} of {{gameplay}} is the optional discovery <b>and</b> <b>collection</b> of manuscript pages from Alan Wake's latest novel—Departure. Although Wake does not remember writing this book, its storyline {{seems to be}} becoming real around him. These readable manuscript pages are scattered around the game world, out of chronological order; they often describe scenes {{that have yet to}} occur and act as warning and instructions for proceeding through upcoming challenges. Other optional collectibles include coffee thermoses scattered around the game world (100 in all), as well as discovering television sets which show different episodes of the fictional Night Springs series, radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls' local radio station, and textual signs around the town. The radio shows and signs provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} town's history and culture. The game's downloadable content episodes introduce other collectibles such as alarm clocks.|$|E

5|$|According to the 2015 Louisiana Laws Revised Statutes, {{residents}} of any unincorporated area may propose to incorporate as a municipality if the area meets prescribed minimum population thresholds. Municipal corporations are divided based on population into three classes: cities, towns, and villages. Those having five thousand inhabitants or more {{are classified as}} cities; those having less than five thousand but more than one thousand inhabitants are classified as towns; and those having one thousand or fewer inhabitants are classified as villages. The governor may change the classification of the municipality if the board of aldermen requests a change and a census shows that the population has increased or decreased making it eligible for a different classification. Municipalities are granted powers to perform functions required by local governments including the levy <b>and</b> <b>collection</b> of taxes and to assume indebtedness.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a new {{emphasis}} on observing, classifying, and cataloging nature, 16th century natural philosophers in Europe began to establish extensive collections of fossil objects (as well as collections of plant and animal specimens), which were often stored in specially built cabinets to help organize them. Conrad Gesner published a 1565 work on fossils that contained one of the first detailed descriptions of such a cabinet <b>and</b> <b>collection.</b> The collection belonged to a member of the extensive network of correspondents that Gesner drew on for his works. Such informal correspondence networks among natural philosophers and collectors became increasingly important {{during the course of the}} 16th century and were direct forerunners of the scientific societies that would begin to form in the 17th century. These cabinet collections and correspondence networks played an important role in the development of natural philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Heat {{waves are}} a common feature of summers in the city. These heat waves place extra demand on {{electricity}} usage, leading to shortages. In extreme cases, these power shortages during heat waves can cause traffic jams and protests, such as the December 2013 heat wave (longest heat wave ever recorded in Buenos Aires) where increased energy demand lead to energy shortages and power cuts, protests against the government over the lack of service, and traffic jams {{as a result of}} these protests. However, most heat waves are of short duration (usually less than a week), and are followed by the passage of the cold, dry Pampero wind, which brings violent and intense thunderstorms with strong gusts and hail followed by cooler temperatures and lower humidity. Occasionally, a tornado can form, which can strike the city although most tornadoes are relatively weak and rarely cause deaths. The greatest risk for tornadoes occurs in the summer season due to the favourable conditions. These severe storms can damage cars, houses and disrupt public services such as transportation <b>and</b> <b>collection</b> and disposal of urban solid waste.|$|E

5|$|Linnaeus felt Uppsala was {{too noisy}} and unhealthy, so he bought two farms in 1758: Hammarby and Sävja. The next year, {{he bought a}} {{neighbouring}} farm, Edeby. He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby; initially it only had a small one-storey house, but in 1762 a new, larger main building was added. In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants {{that could not be}} grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala. He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where he moved his library <b>and</b> <b>collection</b> of plants. A fire that destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move.|$|E
5|$|Most known Albertosaurus {{individuals}} were aged 14 {{years or more}} {{at the time of}} death. Juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons, mainly preservation bias, where the smaller bones of younger animals {{were less likely to be}} preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults, <b>and</b> <b>collection</b> bias, where smaller fossils are less likely to be noticed by collectors in the field. Young Albertosaurus are relatively large for juvenile animals, but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults. It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of life history, rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile Albertosaurus are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.|$|E
5|$|Severe storms impact {{large cities}} {{more often and}} can damage cars, houses and disrupt public {{services}} such as transportation <b>and</b> <b>collection</b> and disposal of urban solid waste. The foothills of the Andes and the Sierras de Cordoba are vulnerable to hail. This is because the Andes force humid air from the Atlantic upwards, intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms, making hail more likely. Mendoza, a city located in the Andean foothills, experiences frequent hailstorms that can impact the agriculture of the region. Hailstorms have caused serious losses in both urban and rural areas. It is estimated that wine and fruit production experience yearly losses of US$50 million and US$30 million, respectively, due to hail. Most of these hailstorms occur in the summer although they can occur in winter, particularly in the east where warm and humid air from the north frequently collides with cold air from the south, leading to convective thunderstorms that can produce hail.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} nonlinear gameplay, allowing multiple {{different ways}} to achieve objectives. This includes travelling between different areas in an open world and making choices that determine the dialogues and order of events as well as alternative endings depending on who the player identifies as the culprit. However, {{only one of the}} characters is the true culprit, while the others are red herrings; if the player closes the case with the wrong culprit, then the player will face criticism from the police chief and need to re-open the case. The game includes a phone {{that could be used to}} manually dial any number, which is needed to contact several non-player characters. The game also features an inventory system requiring the examination <b>and</b> <b>collection</b> of items, which could be used as evidence later in the game.|$|E
5|$|The heavy toll on {{breeding}} birds, {{together with}} loss of habitat through drainage <b>and</b> <b>collection</b> by nineteenth-century trophy hunters and egg collectors, {{meant that the}} species became almost extinct in England by the 1880s, although recolonisation in small numbers has occurred since 1963. The draining of wetlands from the 1800s onwards in southern Sweden {{has resulted in the}} ruff's disappearance from many areas there, although it remains common in the north of the country. The use of insecticides and draining of wetlands has led to a {{decrease in the number of}} ruff in Denmark since the early 1900s. There are still areas where the ruff and other wetland birds are hunted legally or otherwise for food. A large-scale example is the capture of more than one million waterbirds (including ruffs) in a single year from Lake Chilwa in Malawi.|$|E
