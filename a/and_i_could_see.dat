500|$|Westenra is {{the second}} {{youngest}} UNICEF Ambassador to date, behind Selena Gomez. In 2005, Westenra visited Ghana to publicise her project, [...] "Bikes for Ghana", and actively helped with fundraising to purchase bicycles for young girls, allowing them {{to get to their}} schools from outlying surrounding areas. When she was later interviewed about this charity work, she had this to say: [...] "I met girls who had been given bikes <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> how much it meant to them. We wanted to borrow one just for a photo and they wouldn't let them go; they were really reluctant". 2 May 2007, SYD Edition, LOCAL: 5.|$|E
500|$|Several {{actors were}} {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Robert Modell, even Lance Henriksen, who went on to play the lead role in Millennium. Initially, Gilligan considered Harvey Fierstein for the role of Modell, but Robert Wisden read the script and [...] "blew us away". Rob Bowman was pleased with Wisden's performance and said, [...] "I thought Robert Wisden was great as Pusher. He is a very energized kind of confident actor with lots of ideas of his own. It took me about {{a day and a half}} to get him into it, and then I never had to speak to him again, because he had that look in his eyes. I would walk up to talk to him about the scene <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that he was already there.|$|E
500|$|While {{searching for}} investors, Nagy and Berwin {{learned that the}} {{homosexuality}} of the characters was not {{as much of an}} obstacle for securing financing as {{the fact that they were}} women. [...] "Having two women leads was the issue," [...] Nagy noted. In 2015, Berwin said that, in those days, it was a risky idea to play the role of Carol. [...] "As a project it came together with Cate Blanchett. You needed to always start with her role". Film4 Productions and Tessa Ross financed the development of the film and kept it alive throughout the years, as it [...] "underwent a decade-plus of revision under various directors and investors" [...] − including Hettie MacDonald, Kenneth Branagh, Kimberly Peirce, John Maybury, and Stephen Frears − until the project completely stalled. The long trek was a result of the struggles and roadblocks experienced with funding, rights, and trepidations about a film with a gay theme and two female leads. [...] "During its development, there was a very different kind of lesbian or gay movie that got financed", Nagy said. [...] "They were very agenda or issue driven, and this was not. In fact it insists on not being that in order to make the point. I would talk about that with financiers, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> them glaze over." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} with Diane Sawyer, Williams {{admitted that she}} had recently suffered a stroke. [...] "I opened my eyes <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> but I couldn't remember anything from the past," [...] she said. In June 2008, Williams attended Cyd Charisse's funeral, which she did while seated in a wheelchair.|$|E
2500|$|The {{greatest}} MMA fighter of {{all time}} is considered by experts, fighters and fans to be either heavyweight Fedor Emelianenko or middleweight Anderson Silva. UFC color commentator Joe Rogan responded to a fan's question: [...] "Joe, is Fedor the Greatest Of All Time? It's him or Anderson, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the argument going either way honestly. Both guys have had truly magical moments in competition {{against some of the}} best in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Screenwriter Dale Launer, who was {{a friend}} of the Rodger family, stated that he had counseled Rodger on {{approaching}} and befriending women, but that Rodger did not follow the advice. He said in an interview, [...] "I first met [...] when he was aged eight or nine <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> then that {{there was something wrong with}} him. I'm not a psychologist, but looking back now he strikes me as someone who was broken from the moment of conception." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{thinking}} all isn't {{quite as}} it should be aboard of this ship, sir," [...] said he. He was a hard-faced man, <b>and</b> yet <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that he had been startled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{must say}} {{there are some things}} I like over here," [...] said Miss Sophy, with courage. <b>And</b> indeed <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that she was a young woman of great decision.|$|R

2500|$|In 1997, Scientology {{administrator}} Peggy Crawford said in {{a statement}} to The Commercial Appeal: [...] "We definitely believe in God and we believe in individuals as spiritual beings." [...] Professor Paul Blankenship of the Memphis Theological Seminary studied Scientology and commented on this view, saying [...] "They do not do a lot of talking about God or Jesus. It's more getting your mind cleared, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> how they could say that that could be compatible. Scientology has not really developed into a complete religious tradition. They may very well develop." ...|$|E
2500|$|In On a Wing and a Prayer Campese wrote that, [...] "I {{was playing}} full-back and dropped a few bombs the All Blacks put up to me. I had a far from {{spectacular}} game {{and we ended}} up losing. Afterwards, I went in to have a shower <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that Jonsey was very upset... But what right did our coach have to tell the other players, [...] "Don't worry, fellows, you played without a full-back today'. I found that out two days later and you can imagine how I felt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Off-screen actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to quit the role after six years playing Natalie. She {{comments}} “'I'd been back {{for five years and}} had very little to do the year before. I quite like being busy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the scriptwriters were struggling with Natalie and where to place her so it seemed like the right time to go. It's nice that they've left it open, I'd hate to think the door was shut behind me. Absolutely, I'd like to go back, never say never. Maybe I'll track Janine down.” ...|$|E
6000|$|She was all logic now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>see,</b> {{between my}} light and my darkness, {{how she would}} remain so. Yet I was scarce satisfied. [...] "And it's only on 'that effect'----?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I often look at them, <b>and</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the low {{sunlight}} on the stems again. But I {{have never been}} that way but once,--to the churchyard with my mother." ...|$|R
60|$|There was a {{momentary}} jerk of Mary's hand, {{as she was}} filling a tumbler, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the restraint of self-command passing all over her. I had hit something, I knew; so I pursued my game.|$|R
2500|$|The song follows {{what would}} become {{trademark}} Brian May themes such as coming-of-age, nostalgia {{over the loss of}} childhood to the past, and the difficulties of life as an adult. There is also what could be an ambiguous reference to [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", in the lyric: [...] "When I was young it came to me; <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the sun breaking; Lucy was high and so was I; Dazzling, holding the world inside." [...] May is admittedly a Beatles fan and has commented in numerous interviews on their impact on him.|$|E
2500|$|Barresi: [...] "I {{called the}} editor at The Globe and I said, 'I have a tape, I'm {{on the way}} down town to hand it to the District Attorney.' And his words were, 'let us come with you.' And then I knew I had him. The next thought in my mind was I'm going to ask for $30,000. You always ask for twice as much as what you hope to get. He put me on hold, and within less than a minute he came back and he said 'well, we can't give you thirty, we'll give you ten.' I said 'make if fifteen,' he said 'you have a deal.'" [...] Reporter: [...] "Could you see the {{headlines}} coming? Barresi: [...] "Oh yeah, sure, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that money coming too." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carmichael joined ASCAP in 1931. The {{following}} year {{he began working}} as a songwriter for Ralph Peer's Southern Music Company, the first music firm to occupy the new Brill Building, which became famous as a New York songwriting mecca. The Great Depression rapidly {{put an end to}} the jazz scene of the Roaring Twenties. People were no longer attending clubs or buying music, forcing many musicians out of work. Carmichael was fortunate to retain his low-paying, but stable job as a songwriter with Southern Music. Beiderbecke's early death in 1931 also darkened Carmichael's mood. Of that time, he wrote later: [...] "I was tiring of jazz <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that other musicians were tiring as well. The boys were losing their enthusiasm for the hot stuff…. No more hot licks, no more thrills." ...|$|E
60|$|Her voice trembled a little, but {{one could}} hardly notice it. As for me, it brought those old enchanted days {{flooding}} back to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> what <b>I</b> was writing {{for a little}} while.|$|R
60|$|He {{broke into}} silent {{laughter}} again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> joined him. This {{was all so}} deeply characteristic of the life I had known in my youth that I writhed with delight.

6000|$|... "Never mind that," [...] said Rollo. [...] "I {{should like}} that. I {{would put the}} top back, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> all around. <b>I</b> should have a grand ride. I'll go. I wish Jennie had not gone to bed; she could have gone with me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Along with Beatles bandmate John Lennon {{and their}} wives, George Harrison first took the hallucinogenic drug Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in April 1965, when a dentist friend {{slipped it into}} their after-dinner coffee. The {{heightened}} perception induced by the hallucinogen inspired both musicians in their subsequent work with the Beatles, notably on the albums Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and led directly to a shared interest in Eastern philosophical concepts and meditation. Harrison later said of the profound change he felt {{as a result of}} first taking the drug: [...] "I had such an overwhelming feeling of well-being, that there was a God, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> him in every blade of grass. It was like gaining hundreds of years of experience within twelve hours. It changed me, {{and there was no way}} back to what I was before." ...|$|E
2500|$|With a {{capacity}} of 8,500, the Field House was packed. The home crowd waved U.S. flags and sang patriotic songs such as [...] "God Bless America". Before the game, Brooks read his players a statement he had written out {{on a piece of}} paper, telling them that [...] "You were born to be a player. You were meant to be here. This moment is yours." [...] Brooks believed they could win and later said, [...] "The Russians were ready to cut their own throats. But we had {{to get to the point}} to be ready to pick up the knife and hand it to them. So the morning of the game I called the team together and told them, 'It's meant to be. This is your moment and it's going to happen.' It's kind of corny <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> them thinking, 'Here goes Herb again....' But I believed it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "When I {{was about}} 700 feet I pushed the nose down to {{maintain}} height {{and noticed that}} the aircraft began to sink rapidly. I increased the throttle to little effect and then started {{to look for a}} safe landing place, but the area was full of high trees and houses. I increased the throttle and was able to hold height {{for a few minutes and}} then noticed the engine water temperature was over 100 degrees Celsius <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> steam from the left hand engine cowling. The engine lost power again and I saw a chance to land in some allotments, I pushed the control down to 45 degrees and hit the ground at the same angle. I was trapped by my foot and released myself after about two minutes, as I freed myself the engine caught fire. I managed to get to the door of the cabin and only one of the passengers was conscious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can depend}} upon you for that, Mr. Pathurst?" [...] His whole voice and manner had changed. It was {{practically}} a command, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>see</b> fangs, bared and menacing, sprouting in {{the jaws of}} that thing I fancied dwelt behind his eyes.|$|R
5000|$|... like {{opening that}} door all over again. Here {{were all these}} people making music together, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{immediately}} <b>see</b> myself as part of it.

60|$|The {{tide was}} quite low, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> over the reef; {{but in a}} few moments I had {{grounded}} the skiff and had sprung upon the wharf. Out on the ocean, about a mile away, I saw a boat, apparently a large one, approaching the island.|$|R
2500|$|On February 1, 2011, Sondheim joined former Salt Lake Tribune theatre critic Nancy Melich {{before an}} {{audience}} of 1,200 at Kingsbury Hall. Melich described the evening: He was visibly taken by the university choir, who sang two songs during the evening, [...] "Children Will Listen" [...] and [...] "Sunday", {{and then returned to}} reprise [...] "Sunday". During that final moment, Sondheim and I were standing, facing the choir of students from the University of Utah's opera program, our backs to the audience, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> tears welling in his eyes as the voices rang out. Then, all of a sudden, he raised his arms and began conducting, urging the student singers to go full out, which they did, the crescendo building, their eyes locked with his, until the final [...] "on an ordinary Sunday" [...] was sung. It was thrilling, and a perfect conclusion to a remarkable evening – nothing ordinary about it.|$|E
2500|$|Alderman {{was injured}} in the first test of the 1982-83 Ashes. He had taken 1-84 in the first innings {{when there was a}} pitch invasion. Alderman was hit {{in the back of the}} head by a member of the crowd, Gary Donnison. Alderman recalled, [...] "he ran off, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that there were no police in the {{vicinity}} so I attempted to apprehend him." [...] Alderman charged at Donnison and tackled him to the ground but fell on his shoulder and injured himself. [...] "I can't remember a lot of how I fell ... but I was immediately aware I was injured ... it was very painful indeed," [...] Alderman said. [...] "At the time I thought it would just pop back in - little did I know that it would be a year before I could bowl in a competitive match again," [...] he said. [...] "I had to learn to swim a mile a day for eight months. What is tough in sport, is that if you have a physical injury or problem, no one wants to know you. In a way, when I came back, it was like starting another career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Netanyahu defines {{capitalism}} as [...] "the {{ability to}} have individual initiative and competition to produce goods and services with profit, but not to shut out somebody else from {{trying to do the}} same." [...] He says that his views developed while he was working as an economic consult for Boston Consulting Group: [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the Boston Consulting Group looked at governments and worked for governments. They wanted to do a strategic plan for the government of Sweden. I was on that case and looked at other governments. So I went around to other governments in Europe in 1976 and I was looking at Britain. I was looking at France. I was looking at other countries, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that they were stymied by concentrations of power that prevented competition. And I thought, hmm, as bad as they are, ours was worse because we had very little room for private sector competition to the extent that we had government-controlled or union-controlled companies, and so you really didn't get the competition or the growth... And I said, well, if I ever have a chance, I'll change that." ...|$|E
