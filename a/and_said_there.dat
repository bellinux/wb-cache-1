5|$|A two-day {{political}} crisis followed the raid. It {{was obvious to}} the Ottoman government what Enver had allowed to occur. As soon as {{the news of the}} attack reached Istanbul, the Grand Vizier and the Cabinet forced Enver to wire a ceasefire order to Souchon. Several officials, including the Grand Vizier, threatened to resign in protest. Four later would, including Djavid Bey. Though many in the government thought it opportune to attack Russia, solidarity was regarded as vital and a letter of apology was soon drafted. On 31 October Enver informed the Germans of the planned apology <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was nothing he could do.|$|E

5|$|On September 22, 2011, Dugard {{filed suit}} in US District Court for the Northern District of California accusing the United States of failing to monitor Phillip {{when he was a}} federal parolee. Dugard alleged in her lawsuit against the federal {{government}} that parole officials should have returned Garrido to prison for any number of parole violations that preceded her abduction, including testing positive for drugs and alcohol. Her lawsuit was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 15, 2016. The court ruled in a 2–1 decision that Dugard had not been victimized by Garrido {{at the time he was}} placed under federal parole supervision, and there was no way to anticipate she would become his victim. As a result, federal authorities in California had no duty to protect her or other members of the general public from him. In a dissenting opinion, Chief District Court Judge William Smith said the majority had improperly analyzed Dugard's case, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was good reason to hold the government liable.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposals}} {{included an}} eight-storey flatted factory and 16 workshops with car parking above {{them as well}} as a new Assay Office, School of Jewellery, exhibition hall, restaurant, office block and shop. The flatted factory, known as the Hockley Centre (now the Big Peg), was completed in 1971. The workshops with the car parking space was completed in 1978 to the north of this. The scheme was not a success as there were complaints over the higher rent prices and many of the 150 firms that were displaced by the development moved elsewhere in the Quarter. As a result, the council abandoned the plan to progress further with the development <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> would be no more large scale redevelopment in the area.|$|E

Barack Obama reiterated the mention of Buffett <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> are also many other qualified Americans.

25|$|On 29 March 2004 Rau {{arrived at}} the Hann River Roadhouse in North Queensland. She was hitchhiking and {{travelling}} alone. Since it was the wet season, {{and she did not}} have a consistent plan for travel, the locals were concerned for her safety. On 30 March, locals took her from the Roadhouse to the nearby town of Coen, on the Cape York Peninsula. She was taken to the Exchange Hotel in Coen, where locals called the Queensland Police. There Rau gave several versions of her story, identifying herself as Anna Brotmeyer and Anna Schmidt, and spoke both English and German. She said that she was a tourist from Munich, Germany, and that she was planning to continue north as far as Weipa. However, she could not provide any documentation <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was no-one else in Australia who would know she was missing.|$|E
25|$|Although Goddard {{had brought}} {{his work in}} {{rocketry}} {{to the attention of}} the United States Army, between World Wars, he was rebuffed, since the Army largely failed to grasp the military application of large rockets <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was no money for new experimental weapons. German military intelligence, by contrast, had paid attention to Goddard's work. The Goddards noticed that some mail had been opened, and some mailed reports had gone missing. An accredited military attaché to the US, Friedrich von Boetticher, sent a four-page report to the Abwehr in 1936, and the spy Gustav Guellich sent a mixture of facts and made-up information, claiming to have visited Roswell and witnessed a launch. The Abwehr was very interested and responded with more questions about Goddard's work. Guellich's reports did include information about fuel mixtures and the important concept of fuel-curtain cooling, but thereafter the Germans received very little information about Goddard.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Gerasimos Tsourapas of the University of Birmingham {{argues that}} 'historically, Libya {{has been a}} {{preferred}} destination for Egyptian workers seeking opportunity abroad. The Egyptian state, longer established and more developed, sponsored much of this migration, having found that it could cater to the educational and bureaucratic staffing needs of its newly independent neighbor to the west.' With {{a large number of}} Egyptian temporary workers in Libya, there continue to be sporadic problems concerning entry permits, crossing fees and so on. In July 2005, Libya sent back 3,000 Egyptians with invalid work permits and no travel documents. Apparently the workers were victims of fraud by two Egyptian companies who had promised to obtain jobs and work permits in Libya. Later that month Egyptian human rights organizations accused Libya of executing four Egyptians without giving them a fair trial, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> were 15 other Egyptians on the Libyan death row. In March 2007, Libya said they were deporting 32,000 Egyptian workers who did not have papers showing they had been inoculated against avian flu, which would cost 70 dinars. In June 2009, 6000 Egyptians were stuck on the border because Libyan authorities demanded 500 dinars before allowing them to return to Egypt.|$|E
