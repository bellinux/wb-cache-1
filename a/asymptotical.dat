50|$|Parametric tests, such {{as those}} {{described}} in exact statistics, are exact tests when the parametric assumptions are fully met, but in practice {{the use of the}} term exact (significance) test is reserved for those tests that do not rest on parametric assumptions - non-parametric tests. However, in practice most implementations of non-parametric test software use <b>asymptotical</b> algorithms for obtaining the significance value, which makes the implementation of the test non-exact.|$|E

The scale symmetry is broken in two transitioning scales λ and Λ (non-absolute), which divide the scale space in three domains: (1) a classical domain, intermediary, where space-time doesn't depend on resolutions because the laws of movement dominate over scale laws; and two <b>asymptotical</b> domains towards (2) very small and (3) very large scales where scale laws dominate over the laws of movement, which makes explicit the fractal structure of space-time.|$|E
5000|$|The strong {{reductions}} {{listed above}} restrict {{the manner in}} which oracle information can be accessed by a decision procedure but do not otherwise limit the computational resources available. Thus if a set A is decidable then A is reducible to any set B under any of the strong reducibility relations listed above, even if A is not polynomial-time or exponential-time decidable. This is acceptable in the study of recursion theory, which is interested in theoretical computability, but it is not reasonable for computational complexity theory, which studies which sets can be decided under certain <b>asymptotical</b> resource bounds.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{consistency}} can {{be interpreted}} similarly. On the basis of <b>asymptotical</b> unbiasedness, a moderated version of the rational expectations hypothesis can be suggested in which familiarity with the theoretical parameters is not a requirement for the relevant model. An agent with access to sufficiently vast, quality information and high-level methodological skills could specify its own quasi-relevant model describing a specific macroeconomic system. By {{increasing the amount of}} information processed, this agent could further reduce its bias. If this agent were also focal, such as a central bank, then other agents would likely accept the proposed model and adjust their expectations accordingly. In this way, individual expectations become unbiased as much as possible, albeit against a background of considerable passivity. According to some researches, this is the theoretical background of the functionality of inflation targeting regimes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{generalization}} to functions taking {{values in}} any normed vector space is straightforward (replacing absolute values by norms), where f and g need not take their {{values in the}} same space. A generalization to functions g taking values in any topological group is also possible.The [...] "limiting process" [...] x→xo can also be generalized by introducing an arbitrary filter base, i.e. to directed nets f and g.The o notation {{can be used to}} define derivatives and differentiability in quite general spaces, and also (<b>asymptotical)</b> equivalence of functions,which is an equivalence relation and a more restrictive notion than the relationship [...] "f is Θ(g)" [...] from above. (It reduces to lim f / g = 1 if f and g are positive real valued functions.) For example, 2x is Θ(x), but 2x − x is not o(x).|$|E
5000|$|Kronheimer's {{early work}} was on {{gravitational}} instantons, {{in particular the}} classification of hyperkähler four manifolds with <b>asymptotical</b> locally euclidean geometry (ALE spaces)leading to the papers [...] "The construction of ALE spaces as hyper-Kähler quotients" [...] and [...] "A Torelli-type theorem for gravitational instantons." [...] He and Nakajimagave a construction of instantons on ALE spaces generalizing the Atiyah-Hitchin-Drinfeld-Manin construction. This constructions identified these moduli spaces asmoduli spaces for certain quivers (see [...] " [...] Yang-Mills instantons on ALE gravitational instantons.") He was the initial recipient of the Oberwolfach prize in 1998 {{on the basis of}} some of this work. Kronheimer has frequently collaborated with Tomasz Mrowka of MIT. Their collaboration began in Oberwolfach and their first work developed analoguesof Donaldson's invariants for 4-manifolds with a distinguished surface. They used the tools developed to prove a conjecture of Milnor, that four-ballgenus of a (p,q)- torus knot is (p-1)(q-1)/2. They then went on to develop these tools further and established a structure theorem for Donaldson's polynomial invariants using Kronheimer-Mrowka basic classes. After the arrival of Seiberg-Witten theory their work on embedded surfaces culminated in a proof of the Thom conjecture—which had been outstanding for several decades. Another of Kronheimer and Mrowka's results was a proof of the Property P conjecture for knots. They developed an instanton Floer invariant for knots which was used in their proof that Khovanov homology detects the unknot.|$|E

30|$|When using Halanay-type inequalities {{established}} {{in this paper}} to obtain the global <b>asymptotical</b> stability of the equilibrium of a discrete dynamical system with time delays, the positivity of the solutions should be initially guaranteed. This can be proved for many kinds of compartmental infectious disease models. Hence, it is direct to obtain the global <b>asymptotical</b> stability of the disease free equilibria of dynamical systems with time delays by applying Halanay-type inequalities. It is well known that, {{in order to obtain}} the global <b>asymptotical</b> stability of the positive equilibrium (x^*, y^*) of a dynamical system with time delays, the change of variables x̅=x-x^* and y̅=y-y^* is usually applied to transfer the global <b>asymptotical</b> stability of the positive equilibrium to the global <b>asymptotical</b> stability of the zero solution of the system with respect to x̄ and ȳ. However, after the change of variables, the positivity of x̄ and ȳ cannot be guaranteed. Hence, if one intends to employ Halanay-type inequalities to obtain the global <b>asymptotical</b> stability of the positive equilibrium, new techniques are needed to deal with x̄ and ȳ. This remains as future work.|$|E
