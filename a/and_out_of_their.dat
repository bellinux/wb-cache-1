5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) {{all the way to}} the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> non-breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E

More Celts arrived during the BC 3rd century, and in BC 1st century the people of Boii tried to conquer some of the Dacian territory {{on the eastern side}} of the Teiss river. The Dacians drove the Boii south across the Danube <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> territory, at which point the Boii abandoned any further plans for invasion.|$|E

Gerry Evans fathered her son, Michael, seven years ago and is seen as walking in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives as he chooses. As a result, Chris fluctuates between falling into a deep depression when he leaves, yet being renewed with optimism that his next visit will be a permanent stay.

25|$|In physiology, {{dead space}} is {{the volume of}} air which is inhaled that does not {{take part in the}} gas exchange, either because it remains in the {{conducting}} airways, or reaches alveoli that are not perfused or poorly perfused. In other words, not all the air in each breath is available for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Mammals breathe in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lungs, wasting that part of the inspiration which remains in the conducting airways where no gas exchange can occur. In humans, about a third of every resting breath has no change in O2 and CO2 levels.|$|E
25|$|By early 1978, the British Army forces {{involved}} in Operation Banner had recently replaced their ageing Bell H-13 Sioux helicopters {{for the more}} versatile Aérospatiale Gazelles. The introduction of the new machines increased the area covered on a reconnaissance sortie {{as well as the}} improved time spent in airborne missions. In the same period, the Provisional IRA received its first consignment of M60 machine guns from the Middle East, which were displayed by masked volunteers during a Bloody Sunday commemoration in Derry. Airborne operations were crucial for the British presence along the border, especially in south County Armagh, where the level of IRA activity meant that every supply and soldier had to be ferried in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> bases by helicopter since 1975.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} into a wealthy family in St. Louis, Missouri, {{grandson}} of the inventor and founder of the Burroughs Corporation, William Seward Burroughs I, and nephew of public relations manager Ivy Lee. Burroughs began writing essays and journals in early adolescence, but did not begin publicizing his writing until his thirties. He left home in 1932 to attend Harvard University, studied English, and anthropology as a postgraduate, and later attended medical school in Vienna. In 1942 Burroughs enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve during World War II, but was turned down by the Office of Strategic Services and Navy, after which he picked up the drug addiction that affected him {{for the rest of his}} life, while working a variety of jobs. In 1943, while living in New York City, he befriended Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mutual influence grew the foundation of the Beat Generation, which was later a defining influence on the 1960s counterculture.|$|E

25|$|James {{was formed}} in 1982 in Whalley Range, Manchester, when Paul Gilbertson persuaded his friend Jim Glennie to buy a bass guitar and form a band with him. Their line-up {{solidified}} when Gavan Whelan joined on drums. They played a string of gigs under the names Venereal and the Diseases and later, Volume Distortion, before settling on the name of Model Team International, then shortened to Model Team. They performed mostly improvised material derived from jam sessions, supporting the Fall at an early gig at Manchester Polytechnic. Vocalists and other musicians drifted rapidly in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> line-up, until the band encountered Tim Booth at a student disco. Gilbertson invited him to the band's scout hut in Withington to join the band as a dancer; he was soon promoted to lead singer. After a brief period under the name Tribal Outlook, the band renamed themselves James in August 1982. A gig at the Haçienda {{caught the attention of}} Tony Wilson of Factory Records. He offered James an album deal with Factory, but the band, by now a settled live act, were worried about tarnishing their material in the studio and settled instead for a three-track EP. Their debut release, the Jimone EP, was recorded at Strawberry Studios, Stockport, in August 1983 and released on Factory Records in September. It led to the band providing the support for The Smiths between February and April 1985 on the Meat is Murder tour. The Smiths covered James' 'What's The World' track during this tour.|$|E

In dry years, Los Angeles pumped ground water and drained all surface water, diverting all of it into its aqueduct and leaving Owens Valley ranchers without water. [...] Without water for irrigation, the holdout ranchers were forced off their ranches <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> communities; that included the town of Manzanar, which was abandoned by 1929.|$|E
500|$|Moreover, feminist economists {{critique}} {{the focus}} of neoclassical economics on monetary rewards. Nancy Folbre notes, [...] "legal rules and cultural norms can affect market outcomes in ways distinctly disadvantageous to women." [...] This includes occupational segregation resulting in unequal pay for women. Feminist research in these areas contradicts the neoclassical description of labor markets in which occupations are chosen freely by individuals acting alone <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own free will. Feminist economics also includes study of norms relevant to economics, challenging the traditional view that material incentives will reliably provide the goods we want and need (consumer sovereignty), which does not hold true for many people.|$|E

500|$|Richard Eisenbeis at Kotaku found Takumi very unlikable, to {{the point}} of being unsure whether the player is meant to sympathize with him. He also noted that the game was short {{compared}} to the later Science Adventure games, and that the main characters never come together as a group and are not a vital part of Takumi's life, with Takumi instead [...] "wandering in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> stories". Despite this, he found the plot and world gripping, and said that the game was not bad, but that it [...] "might as well be nothing" [...] compared to Steins;Gate. Jenni Lada at TechnologyTell recommended the game, calling it an interesting and mature story, but noted its lack of an English release as unfortunate. Game Informer included Chaos;Head on a list of games they wanted to see localized; they considered a localized version likely due to Steins;Gate English release in 2014.|$|E
500|$|Dragon Quest III {{is noted}} for greatly {{expanding}} upon the gameplay {{of the original}} Dragon Quest and Dragon Quest II. The game uses basic role-playing video game conventions such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. The battle system is turn-based like the other games in the series, though the remakes incorporate various interface changes from later titles. These include simpler door opening, a bag to store items instead of keeping them at a bank, quick item sorting with [...] "Tidy Item" [...] and [...] "Tidy Bag" [...] command, and a [...] "Full HP" [...] command to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells. And while earlier Dragon Quest games were non-linear in structure, Dragon Quest III featured an even more open-world experience. It also allowed the player to freely swap characters in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> party and introduced the day/night cycle in which certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at specific times of the day.|$|E
500|$|On {{creating}} the character, Fazekas said the writers [...] "wanted {{to be really}} specific about who the woman is that Jarvis is just madly in love with" [...] in order to highlight the strong, platonic relationship Jarvis has with Carter. Fazekas added, [...] "It makes sense in that, Jarvis likes Peggy Carter, so of course the woman he's in love with {{would not be a}} quiet, prim and proper lady ... We also wanted to be very clear that Peggy and Ana really like each other, and that there's no jealousy from Ana. Ana and Jarvis are so comfortable in their relationship, they're not going to be jealous of other people coming in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives." [...] On some of the differences between Ana and Edwin, Verbeek said, [...] "The first scene we had I walk in and I smack him on his ass, which is a sort of sexual, playful, fun thing they have. That's not something he would do, that's something she does, and he loves it." [...] D'Arcy later revealed that Verbeek had improvised this on their first day on set, after having [...] " [...] flown in", calling it [...] "brilliantly courageous ... to do it to an actor you don’t know" [...] and [...] "so perfectly what they were hoping that Ana would be like." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gait choice {{can have}} effects beyond {{immediate}} changes in limb movement and speed, notably {{in terms of}} ventilation. [...] Because they lack a diaphragm, lizards and salamanders must expand and contract their body wall in order to force air in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lungs, {{but these are the}} same muscles used to laterally undulate the body during locomotion. [...] Thus, they cannot move and breathe at the same time, a situation called Carrier's constraint, though some, such as monitor lizards, can circumvent this restriction via buccal pumping. [...] In contrast, the spinal flexion of a galloping mammal causes the abdominal viscera to act as a piston, inflating and deflating the lungs as the animal's spine flexes and extends, increasing ventilation and allowing greater oxygen exchange.|$|E

2500|$|Yellowjackets are {{sometimes}} mistakenly called [...] "bees" [...] (as in [...] "meat bees"), given {{that they are}} similar in size and sting, but yellowjackets are actually wasps. They may be confused with other wasps, such as hornets and paper wasps. Polistes dominula, a species of paper wasp, is very frequently misidentified as a yellowjacket. A typical yellowjacket worker is about 12mm (0.5in) long, with alternating bands on the abdomen; the queen is larger, about 19mm (0.75in) long (the different patterns on their abdomens help separate various species). Workers {{are sometimes}} confused with honey bees, especially when flying in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> nests. Yellowjackets, in contrast to honey bees, have yellow or white markings, are not covered with tan-brown dense hair on their bodies, do not carry pollen, {{and do not have}} the flattened hairy hind legs used to carry it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{explosion}} immediately killed 278 Confederate {{soldiers of}} the 18th and 22nd South Carolina, and stunned Confederate troops did not direct any significant musket or artillery fire at the enemy for at least 15 minutes. However, Ledlie's untrained division was not prepared for the explosion, and reports indicate they waited ten minutes before leaving their own entrenchments. Footbridges {{were supposed to have}} been placed to allow them to quickly cross their own trenches, but these were missing, meaning the men had to climb in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own trenches just to reach no-man's land. Once they had wandered to the crater, instead of moving around it as the black troops had been trained to do, they thought it would make an excellent rifle pit and it would be well to take cover. Therefore, they moved down into the crater itself, wasting valuable time while the Confederates, under Brig. Gen. William Mahone, gathered as many troops together as they could for a counterattack. In about an hour's time, they had formed up around the crater and began firing rifles and artillery down into it, in what Mahone later described as a [...] "turkey shoot". The plan had failed, but Burnside, instead of cutting his losses, sent in Ferrero's men. Now faced with considerable flanking fire, they also went down into the crater, and for the next few hours, Mahone's soldiers, along with those of Maj. Gen. Bushrod Johnson and artillery, slaughtered the IX Corps as it attempted to escape from the crater. Some Union troops eventually advanced and flanked to the right beyond the Crater to the earthworks and assaulted the Confederate lines, driving the Confederates back for several hours in hand-to-hand combat. Mahone's Confederates conducted a sweep out of a sunken gully area about [...] from {{the right side of the}} Union advance. This charge reclaimed the earthworks and drove the Union force back towards the east.|$|E
