500|$|Walternate learns of Walter's {{presence}} {{in the hospital and}} dispatches [...] "Fauxlivia" [...] (Torv) and [...] "Alt-Charlie" [...] (Kirk Acevedo) to apprehend him, but before their <b>arrival</b> <b>Bell</b> and Olivia liberate Walter and escape. Fauxlivia sees a surveillance shot of Olivia and Walter and decides to confer with Walternate about the doppelgängers. During a discussion in his office, Walternate lies to Peter about the doomsday machine's real purpose, claiming it can help to heal both worlds. Fauxlivia meets Peter in Walternate's office and subsequently drives him to his new apartment. Walter and Bell travel to Harvard to collect some equipment necessary for the journey back to their own universe, and Walter reveals his intense dislike for Bell, whom he considers to have been a selfish war profiteer while he himself was locked away for seventeen years. Bell tells Walter that the parallel universe equivalent of himself died in a car accident as a young man. Olivia confronts Fauxlivia, who recognizes that Olivia has feelings for Peter. The women fight, and after rendering Fauxlivia unconscious Olivia dyes her hair to assume Fauxlivia's identity. Meanwhile, Peter discovers that the machine is symbiotic and needs a particular human to control it—him.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{compiling}} a 66-35 record and winning three PFL championships {{at a school}} that had only posted one winning season before his <b>arrival,</b> <b>Bell's</b> contract was not renewed after the 2015 season due to [...] "philosophical differences". [...] While the school's administration {{wanted to keep the}} football program as-is, Bell had publicly mentioned his goal of eventually growing the non-scholarship Jacksonville program into a scholarship-based program which could better compete with other scholarship-supported programs in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).|$|R

50|$|Vanderbei’s <b>arrival</b> at <b>Bell</b> Labs {{coincided with}} Narendra Karmarkar’s {{discovery}} of a new polynomial-time algorithm for linear programming. In May 1985, {{he became the first}} nonmanagement team member of AT&T's Advanced Decision Support Systems venture, where he served as the interface to Karmarkar and as the lead developer of the first release of the linear programming software.|$|R
25|$|Upon Faisal's <b>arrival</b> in 1921, <b>Bell</b> {{advised him}} on local questions, {{including}} matters involving tribal geography and local business. She also supervised {{the selection of}} appointees for cabinet and other leadership posts in the new government.|$|R
50|$|Undecorated pottery {{continued}} {{from the}} Neolithic period {{up until the}} <b>arrival</b> of the <b>Bell</b> Beaker culture with its characteristic pottery style, which is mainly found around the Ebro Valley. Building of megalithic structures continued until the Late Bronze Age.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>arrival</b> of Derek <b>Bell</b> on harp gave The Chieftains a {{distinctive}} delicate sound. The slow air [...] "Mná na hÉireann" [...] (Women of Ireland), composed by Seán Ó Riada, {{was used in}} Stanley Kubrick's 1975 film Barry Lyndon. In 1996 Mike Oldfield recorded it on his album Voyager but credited it to [...] "Traditional".|$|R
50|$|Disney Fairies: Tinker Bell is an {{adventure}} {{game for the}} Nintendo DS. The game begins with Tinker <b>Bell's</b> <b>arrival</b> in Pixie Hollow, preparing each season. As the seasons progress, more areas from the game become accessible. After all four seasons are completed, every area may be visited and season preparations become optional and vary each time. Various different tasks must be accomplished, which are bestowed upon the player by other characters. Such tasks include deliveries, item repairs, requests for items and searching for insects.|$|R
25|$|In {{the sixth}} series, Nero and Clem have finally begun dating after their summer romance, but {{eventually}} break up after their several arguments. Clem departs in episode three {{to pursue a}} career in music. Dexter and Lizzie are expecting a baby, and eventually give birth to twins named Albert and Faraday. After his divorce in the previous series, and a brief relationship with newcomer Anastasia (Rachel Elizabeth Kelly), Bell finds himself living in a run-down caravan on the school grounds with his estranged son CJ (Rufus T King-Dabbs), a newcomer to the series. Dexter and Nero are both shocked at CJ's <b>arrival,</b> as <b>Bell</b> never mentioned in any previous series that he had a child. The series also introduces the characters of Polly Morgan (Mischa Eckersley), a fellow pupil of Nero's whom he tries to impress throughout the series and Owen's younger brother Chester (Rohan Green). In Series 6, Isobel Harlow was promoted to a series regular as she appeared in every episode.|$|R
2500|$|With the <b>arrival</b> of the <b>Bell</b> Aircraft P-59 Airacomet jet fighter, the Mojave Desert {{station was}} chosen as a secluded site for testing this super-secret airplane. The first XP-59 arrived on 21 September 1942, ground tests were {{underway}} five days later, and a first flight accomplished on 30 September when the XP-59 rose to [...] altitude for [...] during taxi testing. [...] However, the first official flight was 1 October 1942 with NACA, Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, Royal Air Force, Army, Bell and General Electric personnel on hand. [...] Additional World War II test flights included the Northrop JB-1 Bat.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1794 Mission San Luis Obispo {{went through}} {{extensive}} building operations. They helped build numerous buildings {{to accommodate the}} nearby Indians. They also made many improvements and additions to the Mission. The renovation was finally finished when they completed the quadrangle in 1819, celebrated a year later {{by the arrival of}} two mission bells from Lima, Peru. The <b>arrival</b> of the <b>bells</b> marked the end of improvements made to Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa for many years. In 1830 Fr. Luis Gil y Taboada took over the mission, but he died three years later. Then in 1842 the death of Fr. Ramon Abella marked the last Franciscan at the mission.|$|R
50|$|Stevenson's {{work on the}} Bell Rock and {{elsewhere}} provided a fund of anecdotes of the danger in which he placed himself. Returning from the Orkney Islands in 1794 on the sloop Elizabeth of Stromness, he {{had the good fortune}} to be rowed ashore when the Elizabeth became becalmed off Kinnaird Head; the ship was later driven back by a gale to Orkney, and there foundered losing all hands. On Bell Rock, which was covered by all but the lowest tide, he tells of an occasion when one of the crew boats drifted away leaving insufficient carrying capacity for the crew in the remaining boats; the situation was saved by the timely <b>arrival</b> of the <b>Bell</b> Rock pilot boat, on an errand to deliver mail to Stevenson.|$|R
25|$|Citizens of Zwolle are colloquially {{known as}} Blauwvingers (Bluefingers). This {{dates back to}} 1682, when the StMichael's church tower collapsed. The {{authorities}} were strapped for cash and saw {{no option but to}} sell the church bells to neighbouring city Kampen. To make sure that Kampen would not make too much profit from the deal, the local authorities asked a high price for the church bells. Kampen accepted, yet after the <b>arrival</b> of the <b>bells</b> it became clear, they were too damaged to be played. In revenge, Kampen paid in copper coins of four duiten (the equivalent of two-and-a-half cents). Zwolle distrusted Kampen and wanted to be sure they truly paid the entire price. After the rigorous counting of this vast amount of money, their fingers had turned blue from the copper.|$|R
25|$|Having {{been put}} in to bat by the West Indians, England started slowly, losing captain Alastair Cook (11), Jonathan Trott (0) and Gary Ballance (10) in the first session, but the <b>arrival</b> of Ian <b>Bell</b> and Joe Root to the crease with England on 34/3 saw the pair put on 177 runs for the fourth wicket. Root fell 17 runs short of a century when he played a {{delivery}} from Jerome Taylor onto his own stumps, but Bell managed to kick on to a century of his own, ably supported {{from the other end}} by Ben Stokes, adding 130 runs for the fifth wicket before Bell was caught behind off Kemar Roach for 143 {{at the end of the}} penultimate over of the day. Nevertheless, England reached the close of play on day 1 at 341/5.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after his}} <b>arrival</b> in Kansas, <b>Bell</b> saw and photographed the {{mutilated}} body of Sergeant Frederick Wyllyams, a U.S. soldier {{who had been}} killed by Indians. The gruesome image was published in Harper's Weekly, which railroad officials considered to be bad publicity and which caused them to become concerned that Bell intended to make money from sale of expedition photos. The railroad hired Alexander Gardner to be chief photographer for the survey expedition. However, the expedition split into two parties, and for a time Bell continued his photographic work {{as a member of the}} southern party that scouted a route through New Mexico and west along the 32nd parallel, while Gardner was part of the northern party that followed the 35th parallel. As an expedition member, Bell formed a friendship with the expedition's leader, General William J. Palmer, who was later to become his partner in several business ventures.|$|R
25|$|The Bell Homestead period {{began with}} the <b>arrival</b> of the <b>Bell</b> family {{in the summer of}} 1870 from their native Scotland, where two of their sons had died of {{tuberculosis}} and their middle son, Alexander Graham Bell, was additionally stricken and being consumed by disease. The Bell Homestead complex in the present day consists of several buildings with their own origins. The principal building at the site is Alexander Melville Bell's farmhouse, Melville House, along with its related greenhouse conservatory, outbuildings and fruit orchard. The farmhouse and its farmland were acquired for preservation as a museum in 1909. The Henderson Home, which had served as Canada's first telephone business office in downtown Brantford, was later moved to the site in 1969 and renovated extensively in 1970, to convert it into a separate telephone museum under the principal sponsorship of the county's largest telephone carrier, Bell Canada. As well, a tea house, a visitor reception centre with a mini audio-video theatre and related facilities were also added to the homestead to accommodate visitors and tour groups.|$|R
50|$|Stephen Linton {{founded the}} Eugene Bell Centennial Foundation in 1995 to provide {{teaching}} and research to North Korea. The foundation was {{named in honor of}} the 100th anniversary of the <b>arrival</b> of Eugene <b>Bell,</b> his ancestor, to Korea as a missionary. From 1996 to 1998, the foundation provided grain and other food aid to North Koreans. At the request of the North Korean government, the foundation began to focus on medical aid in 1998, spending the next ten years setting up a monitored supply chain that provided diagnostic and operating room assistance to medical facilities across North Korea. By 2008, drug-resistant tuberculosis, in particular multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, had emerged as a significant and untreated threat, prompting the North Korean government to invite Eugene Bell to aid patients with the disease. As of 2014, the Eugene Bell Foundation is providing aid to 12 treatment centers in the form of medicine, diagnostic equipment, and treatment consultation. In 2013, 885 patients received care at Eugene Bell-supported multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment centers, a number expected to rise to 1,500 by the end of 2014.|$|R
50|$|Later in the novel, Joppolo gains {{the admiration}} of Lieutenant Livingston, who invites Joppolo to come {{have a drink}} {{with some of his}} navy buddies. While there, Joppolo tells them of the town's need for a bell. Commander Robertson realizes that they might have exactly the bell that Adano needs, the USS Corelli. The <b>arrival</b> of the <b>bell</b> to the town coincides with a party that the town is hosting for Joppolo to express their {{gratitude}} for all of his great doings. Although the bell has arrived at the town, the engineers say that it will take them until the next morning to install it. At the same time Sergeant Borth, one of Major Joppolo's aides, finds a note from General Marvin that says that Joppolo has been relieved of duty as administrator of Adano because he countermanded General Marvin's order. Sergeant Borth tells Joppolo that he has been relieved from duty while they are at the party and hands Joppolo the order. The next morning, Joppolo leaves Adano, but does not say goodbye to anyone because he does not think he could. As the jeep is driving away, he tells the driver to stop for a moment. They hear the clear sound of a loud bell.|$|R
50|$|The initial use for Muroc was IV Bomber Command Operational Unit {{training}}. The B-25 Mitchell 41st and 30th Bombardment Groups and the A-20 Havoc 47th Bombardment Groups {{trained at}} the station in early 1942. The training provided newly graduated pilots eight to twelve weeks of training as a team using the same aircraft they would use in combat. The training mission was transferred to IV Fighter Command, with P-38 Lightning OTU training for the 78th and 81st Fighter Groups during 1942. The 360th Fighter Group and 382d Bombardment Groups were assigned permanently to Muroc in 1943 for P-38 Lightning and B-24 Liberator Replacement Training (RTU) of personnel.With the <b>arrival</b> of the <b>Bell</b> Aircraft P-59 Airacomet jet fighter, the Mojave Desert station was chosen as a secluded site for testing this super-secret airplane. The first XP-59 arrived on 21 September 1942, ground tests were underway five days later, and a first flight accomplished on 30 September when the XP-59 rose to ten feet altitude for one-half mile during taxi testing. However, the first official flight was 1 October 1942 with NACA, Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, Royal Air Force, Army, Bell and General Electric personnel on hand. Additional World War II test flights included the Northrop JB-1 Bat.|$|R
5000|$|Until the <b>arrival</b> of Andy <b>Bell</b> in the Autumn of 1999, White was the token southerner in the {{otherwise}} Mancunian Oasis. Initially known as 'Whitey', {{he was later}} re-christened 'Dave' by the band because he once served himself a drink from an unattended bar, therefore resembling the character Dave from [...] "The Winchester" [...] in the '70s TV series Minder. White commented on the [...] "North/South divide" [...] saying {{it was not that}} bad, but [...] "for ages I was the 'Cockney cunt' and they were the 'Manc fuckers'". In his book What's the Story? Ian Robertson stated that White was also known by the phrase [...] "Alan White - He's alright".White was also entrusted with the job of being Liam Gallagher's 'official' drinking partner and was also said to be his best friend in the band. Together the pair were known as 'Bert and Ernie', named after the Sesame Street-characters. In December 2002 Liam and White were involved in a high-profile brawl in a German bar. Consequently, Liam lost some of his front teeth, and White needed a brain scan after suffering minor head injuries. Both were arrested by the authorities and were released only after the band's management paid for their bail.|$|R
40|$|Frederick W. Sardeson was {{a highly}} capable, innovative, productive, and {{fascinating}} figure in geology, yet he never enjoyed admiration from most of his contemporaries or lasting distinction in his chosen field. Cut adrift from his teaching post in middle age, he had to live by nip and tuck thereafter. Nevertheless, his legacy of published geology is of interest still to students of the Lower Paleozoic rocks and fossils of the Upper Mississippi Valley, and to students of Ordovician fossils from several phyla. This report attempts to explain something of Sardeson's qualities and behavior, to give balance to the record of his professional accomplishments, and to throw {{some light on the}} practice of geology in the half century prior to World War II. How is it that one undertakes to study and report on such a person in detail? As a graduate student in geology at the University of Minnesota in 1949, I was assigned by W. Charles Bell to prepare a brief account of Sardeson and his contributions to the science of geology. Bell turned me on to Sardeson to help me prepare for my dissertation work on the lithoand biostratigraphy of the Middle Ordovician rocks of Fillmore County in southeastern Minnesota. Charlie Bell had told his students stories from his short acquaintance with Sardeson (1946 - 47), between <b>Bell's</b> <b>arrival</b> in Minneapolis and Sardeson's departure for Seattle, and I was able to recall those accounts. In addition, in 1949, I interviewed several persons who had known Sardeson. Among those were Frank F. Grout, recently retired from the Department of Geology and, as I now know, a major antagonist of Sardeson early in this century; plant ecologist William S. Cooper, who skirmished with Sardeson over the Anoka sandplain; and Frederick K. Butters, also of the Botany Department. Some biographical information came from the Minnesota Alumni office, and the President's office gave some details of his dismissal from the University. For the early orientation to Sardeson's work I also consulted some of his published works and the standard reference volumes...|$|R
