40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the fate of}} Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland (BLNS) following the 1999 free trade agreement between the European Union and South Africa. As members - with South Africa - of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), the BLNS countries are now effectively locked into reciprocal trade liberalization with the EU. The BLNS governments' <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>agreement</b> was accompanied by offers of various forms of financial assistance. The study clarifies the links between trade liberalization and financial compensation, and their longer-term implications for BLNS countries' economic relations with the EU. It finds that not economic adjustment but the political <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> free trade has {{played a leading role}} in the way compensation payments have been granted.

50|$|Israel imposed {{sanctions}} on the Palestinians and suspended {{the transfer of}} the taxes it collected on behalf of the PA. The US also imposed economic sanctions and prohibited all Hamas-related financial transactions. The Middle East Quartet called for reviewing all assistance to any new government against its commitment to the principles of nonviolence, recognition <b>of</b> Israel, and <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> previous <b>agreements</b> and obligations. As a result, the international community suspended its international aid to the Palestinians, causing big damage to the Palestinian economy. Eventually, aid was diverted via a Temporary International Mechanism or directly to the accounts of President Mahmoud Abbas, bypassing the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority.|$|R
