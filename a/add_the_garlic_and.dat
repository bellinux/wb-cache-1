The onion enzyme has a holoenzyme molecular weight of 200, 000 composed of four subunits of molecular weight 50, 000.

The results showed that <b>garlic,</b> ginger <b>and</b> mixtures contained 7. 41, 5. 85 and 6. 62 % crude protein respectively. Dietary treatment significantly influenced the final liveweights (FLW) of broiler chicks (P< 0. 001) and chickens (P< 0. 01). <b>The</b> mixtures of <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> ginger significantly (P< 0. 001) improved FLW and weight gain th of the 28 day old chicks than those of control birds. Garlic at 1. 5 and 2 % ginger significantly (P< 0. 01) decreased the FLW of the chickens relative to the control. Dietary treatment significantly (P< 0. 001) affected the carcass parts and organs development of broiler chickens. However, dietary <b>garlic,</b> ginger <b>and</b> mixtures {{did not affect the}} red blood cells and haemoglobin concentration of the chickens. <b>The</b> mixtures of <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> ginger exhibited better antilipidemic influence on the serum cholesterol, triacylglycerol and abdominal fat pad of the chickens than sole <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> ginger.
