XAS can be divided into X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), which provides information primarily about the geometry and oxidation state, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), which provides information about metal site ligation.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{development}} of new advanced technologies in the field of information storage and electronic devices requires a great effort in improving the performance of magnetic materials that are at the basis of the device’s functioning. Among the magnetic materials, chemically ordered binary alloys (L 10, L 12) are of significant interest due to the peculiar atomic arrangement within the crystallographic cell, which induces in the material, through the spin-orbit interaction, a high magnetocrystalline anisotropy. This project will aim at investigating by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) the degree of chemical order within different magnetic alloys and to understand the influence of specific process conditions (growth and annealing temperature, addition of a third element) on the transformation from the chemically disordered state (fcc structure) to the chemically ordered structure (fct or fcc L 10, L 12).

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} estimate the error when the flat-flux approximation is used to compute the resonance integral for a single <b>absorber</b> <b>element</b> embedded in a neutron source. The {{investigation was}} initiated by assuming a parabolic flux distribution in computing the flux-averaged escape probability which occurs in the collision density equation. Furthermore, also assumed were both wide resonance and narrow resonance expressions for the resonance integral. The fact that this simple model demonstrated {{a decrease in the}} resonance integral motivated the more detailed investigation of the thesis. An integral equation describing the collision density as a function of energy, position and angle is constructed and is subsequently specialized to the case of energy and spatial dependence. This equation is further simplified by expanding the spatial dependence in a series of Legendre polynomials (since a one-dimensional case is considered). In this form, the effects of slowing-down and flux depression may be accounted for to any degree of accuracy desired. The resulting integral equation for the energy dependence is thus solved numerically, considering the slowing down model and the infinite mass model as separate cases. From the solution obtained by the above method, the error ascribable to the flat-flux approximation is obtained. In addition to this, the error introduced in the resonance integral in assuming no slowing down in the absorber is deduced. Results by Chernick for bismuth rods, and by Corngold for uranium slabs, are compared to the latter case, and these agree to within the approximations made. ...|$|E

40|$|We are {{developing}} arrays of position-sensitive transition-edge sensor (POST) X-ray detectors for future astronomy missions such as NASA's Constellation-X. The POST consists of multiple absorbers thermally coupled {{to one or}} more transition-edge sensor (TES). Each <b>absorber</b> <b>element</b> has a different thermal coupling to the TES. This results in a distribution of different pulse shapes and enables position discrimination between the absorber elements. POST'S are motivated by the desire to achieve the largest possible focal plane area with the fewest number of readout channels and are ideally suited to increasing the Constellation-X focal plane area, without comprising on spatial sampling. Optimizing the performance of POST'S requires careful design of key parameters such as the thermal conductances between the absorbers, TES and the heat sink. as well as the absorber heat capacities.

40|$|Metallic {{magnetic}} calorimeters (MMC) {{are one of}} {{the most}} promising devices to provide very high energy resolution needed for future astronomical x-ray spectroscopy. MMC detectors can be built to large detector arrays having thousands of pixels. Position-sensitive magnetic (PoSM) microcalorimeters consist of multiple absorbers thermally coupled to one magnetic micro calorimeter. Each <b>absorber</b> <b>element</b> has a different thermal coupling to the MMC, resulting in a distribution of different pulse shapes and enabling position discrimination between the absorber elements. PoSMs therefore achieve the large focal plane area with fewer number of readout channels without compromising spatial sampling. Excellent performance of PoSMs was achieved by optimizing the designs of key parameters such as the thermal conductance among the absorbers, magnetic sensor, and heat sink, as well as the absorber heat capacities. Micro fab ri - cation techniques were developed to construct four-absorber PoSMs, in which each absorber consists of a two-layer composite of bismuth and gold. The energy resolution (FWHM full width at half maximum) was measured to be better than 5 eV at 6 keV x-rays for all four absorbers. Position determination was demonstrated with pulse-shape discrimination, as well as with pulse rise time. X-ray microcalorimeters are usually designed to thermalize as quickly as possible to avoid degradation in energy resolution from position dependence to the pulse shapes. Each pixel consists of an absorber and a temperature sensor, both decoupled from the cold bath through a weak thermal link. Each pixel requires a separate readout channel; for instance, with a SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device). For future astronomy missions where thousands to millions of resolution elements are required, having an individual SQUID readout channel for each pixel becomes difficult. One route to attaining these goals is a position-sensitive detector in which a large continuous or pixilated array of x-ray absorbers shares fewer numbers of temperature sensors. A means of discriminating the signals from different absorber positions, however, needs to be built into the device for each sensor. The design concept for the device is such that the shape of the temperature pulse with time depends on the location of the absorber. This inherent position sensitivity of the signal is then analyzed to determine the location of the event precisely, effectively yielding one device with many sub-pixels. With such devices, the total number of electronic channels required to read out a given number of pixels is significantly reduced. PoSMs were developed that consist of four discrete absorbers connected to a single magnetic sensor. The design concept can be extended to more than four absorbers per sensor. The thermal conductance between the sensor and each absorber is different by design and consequently, the pulse shapes are different depending upon which absorber the xrays are received, allowing position discrimination. A magnetic sensor was used in which a paramagnetic Au:Er temperature-sensitive material is located in a weak magnetic field. Deposition of energy from an x-ray photon causes an increase in temperature, which leads to a change of magnetization of the paramagnetic sensor, which is subsequently read out using a low noise dc-SQUID. The PoSM microcalorimeters are fully microfabricated: the Au:Er sensor is located above the meander, with a thin insulation gap in between. For this position-sensitive device, four electroplated absorbers are thermally linked to the sensor via heat links of different thermal conductance. One pixel is identical to that of a single-pixel design, consisting of an overhanging absorber fabricated directly on top of the sensor. It is therefore very strongly thermally coupled to it. The three other absorbers are supported directly on a silicon-nitride membrane. These absorbers are thermally coupled to the sensor via Ti (5 nm) /Au 250 nm) metal links. The strength of the links is parameterized by the number of gold squares making up the link. For detector performance, experimentally different pulse-shapes were demonstrated with 6 keV x-rays, which clearly show different rise times for different absorber positions. For energy resolution measurement, the PoSM was operated at 32 mK with an applied field that was generated using a persistent current of 50 mA. Over the four pixels, energy resolution ranges from 4. 4 to 4. 7 eV were demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the study}} is the {{investigation}} of the build-up of copper clusters in reactors pressure vessel (RPV) steels. The study comprises tests on RPV surveillance samples provided by a nuclear power plant, and on RPV reference samples. The reference steels, named Japanese Reference Quality (JRQ), were provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Moreover the study was completed with the investigation of some unirradiated binary alloys. To better understand the mechanism of cluster build-up in a simplified system, tests were performed on the binary alloy Fe-Cu containing 1. 3 at % Cu. The samples were annealed at 775 K for different times. They were analysed using x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy at the Cu K-edge, x-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that Cu cluster formation occurs even with short annealing times. These clusters with a diameter of a few nm have been observed to switch easily from bcc Fe-like to fcc Cu-like structure. While a short annealing time of 2. 5 h at 775 K does practically not change the good dilution of Cu in the bcc Fe matrix, an annealing treatment for 312 h leads to large fcc Cu precipitates. A linear combination analysis suggests that in the sample annealed for 8 h, Cu clusters are formed mostly in the same structure as the bcc matrix. A coexistence of bcc and fcc clusters is obtained for 115 h of annealing. TEM indicates the presence of precipitates with a diameter up to 60 nm for an annealing time of 312 h, and XRD provides complementary data about the clusters size distributions in differently annealed samples. The reactor pressure vessel (RPV) reference steel from IAEA submitted to neutron irradiation in a research reactor and subsequently thermally annealed and re-irradiated was investigated by XAFS spectroscopy. It could be expected that Cu and Ni atoms form nano-clusters. In the unirradiated sample and in the irradiated sample no significant clustering is detected. In all irradiated and subsequently annealed samples an increase of Cu and Ni atom densities are recorded around the x-ray absorbing atoms. Furthermore, the density of Cu and Ni atoms determined in the first and second shell around the absorber is found to be affected by irradiation and the annealing treatment. The comparison of the XAFS data at the Cu and Ni K-edges shows that these elements are in a bcc structure like the Fe host lattice. However, the local irradiation damage reduces the number of next neighbour atoms around copper; while the annealing reduces the number of vacancies. The number of Cu and Ni atoms around (Cu or Ni) absorbers then increases. The IAEA samples are very well characterised due to earlier analysis by atom probe tomography (APT) at the Oak-Ridge National Lab (ORNL) and mechanical tests, at the Paul Scherrer Institut. The possibility to compare XAFS and APT provided an invaluable opportunity to understand the differences and similarities among the two techniques. XAFS and APT are both very sensitive to nanostructures and both are element selective techniques. XAFS is highly sensible to the average environment of the <b>absorber</b> <b>element,</b> within < 0. 5 nm, so it delivers information about the short range order. The results show a general agreement and the differences were considered within the experimental error. Finally, surveillance samples from a Swiss nuclear power plant (KKG Kernkraftwerk Gösgen) were analysed by XAFS. The number of Cu and Ni atoms determined in the first and second shell around the absorbers is affected by irradiation and temperature. The comparison of the EXAFS data at the Cu and Ni K-edges shows that these elements are in a crystallographic structure similar to bcc Fe. There are indications that the formation of Cu and Ni clusters differs significantly; irradiation damage reduces the next neighbour number for both elements. Clusters were detected only around copper atoms: the number of Cu atoms in the first two shells was found to increase with the irradiation time. With EXAFS it could be verified that neutron irradiation in a power reactor leads to small changes of the local atomic environment around the investigated Cu and Ni atoms. Moreover, most of the local structural changes are obtained for the sample with the longest irradiation time. This lets assume that the reduction of the number of next neighbours in the bcc structure around Cu and Ni in the steel matrix is steadily increasing with the years of irradiation in the reactor. However it can be expected that the elevated temperature helps refilling the irradiation induced vacancies by a permanent annealing process. The detailed EXAFS analysis has demonstrated that the number of Cu atoms in the local vicinity of copper is enriched during irradiation in the power plant, while the local atomic environment around nickel seems to be less affected. Cu and Ni atoms behave similarly in the IAEA samples, but they show differences in the power reactor samples. The reasons for the different behaviour reside in the different irradiation processes: IAEA samples were strongly irradiated and then annealed at high temperature, while the KKG samples were irradiated at a higher temperature than the IAEA samples without any post irradiation annealing. Obviously neutron irradiation forms many vacancies and vacancies clusters, which are easily filled by solute atoms. In case of irradiation in the power reactor, there are fewer vacancies and the temperatures involved are lower than the annealing temperature of the IAEA reference samples; the atom cluster formation of Cu is slowed down and Ni is even less affected...|$|E

40|$|The {{expected}} {{increase of}} luminosity at sLHC {{by a factor}} of ten with respect to LHC luminosities has serious consequences for the signal reconstruction, radiation hardness requirements and operations of the ATLAS liquid argon calorimeters (EMEC, HEC, FCAL) in the endcap, respectively forward region. Small modules of each type of calorimeter have been built. The layout and the components used are very close to the ones used {{in the construction of the}} ATLAS calorimeter. The goal is to simulate in the high intensity proton beam at IHEP /Protvino the particle impact as expected for ATLAS in sLHC. Depending on the position in pseudorapidity |η|, each forward calorimeter has to cope with a different particle and energy flux. Placing <b>absorber</b> <b>elements</b> in-between the various small calorimeter modules, the particle and energy flux as expected in ATLAS later - given the variation due to |η| and longitudinal position - can be simulated very well...|$|R
40|$|The {{change of}} {{electrical}} conductivity in chalcopyrite i. e., Cu Inx, Ga 1 amp; 8722;x Se 2 or CIGSe solar cells induced by nanosecond laser pulses is investigated {{as a function}} of the elemental composition and its spatial distribution. The underlying laser induced phase transformation process, which results in a decomposition of the CIGSe semiconductor and a modification of its elemental composition, is utilized to form the monolithic series interconnection between front and back contact in CIGSe based thin film solar cells. The results show a dependence of the composition of the CIGSe layer and the resulting series resistance on the applied laser fluence. Lower series resistance is primarily related to an enhanced fraction of copper, gallium and zinc in the laser transformed zone resulting from selective vaporization of <b>absorber</b> <b>elements.</b> For intermediate laser fluences 0. 36 J cm 2 a patterning process is established that allows reliable and high quality series interconnection. Both, lower and higher laser fluences result in high series resistances due to incomplete phase transformation or damages of the back contact, respectively...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} and test program {{was conducted to}} evaluate means for increasing the effectiveness of low frequency sound absorbing liners for aircraft turbine engines. Three schemes for coupling low frequency <b>absorber</b> <b>elements</b> were considered. These schemes were analytically modeled and their impedance was predicted over a frequency range of 50 to 1, 000 Hz. An optimum and two off-optimum designs of the most promising, a parallel coupled scheme, were fabricated and tested in a flow duct facility. Impedance measurements were in good agreement with predicted values and validated the procedure used to transform modeled parameters to hardware designs. Measurements of attenuation for panels of coupled resonators were consistent with predictions based on measured impedance. All coupled resonator panels tested showed an increase in peak attenuation of about 50 % {{and an increase in}} attenuation bandwidth of one one-third octave band over that measured for an uncoupled panel. These attenuation characteristics equate to about 35 % greater reduction in source perceived noise level (PNL), relative to the uncoupled panel, or a reduction in treatment length of about 24 % for constant PNL reduction. The increased effectiveness of the coupled resonator concept for attenuation of low frequency broad spectrum noise is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. During {{the course}} of Hamburg/CfA Bright Quasar Survey we {{discovered}} a bright (B = 15. 9), high redshift (zem = 2. 51) quasar HS 1603 + 3820. The quasar has a rich complex of Civ absorbers, containing at least five systems, all within 3000 km s − 1 from one another. Despite large ejection velocity (vej> 5000 km s − 1 for all components) the complex {{is likely to be}} associated with the quasar. There are at least three more associated heavy <b>element</b> <b>absorbers,</b> two of which have zabs> zem. Together, they make one of the richest known complexes of associated heavy <b>element</b> <b>absorbers,</b> and the richest in objects with B< 16. The combination of redshift, brightness, richness of the metal absorption spectrum and richness of the associated absorption is unmatched among known quasars...|$|R
40|$|MBIR is a {{multipurpose}} fast sodium cooled {{research reactor}} with a thermal power of 150 MW {{designed for a}} broad range of applications in the field of experimental research, including endurance tests and optimization of operating modes for advanced types of fuel, fuel <b>elements,</b> <b>absorber</b> <b>elements</b> and fuel assemblies, radiation tests of advanced structural materials, production of isotopes for a variety of applications and so on [1, 2]. Therefore, one of the major requirements to this reactor is a high flux of neutrons (not lower than 5 ⋅ 1015 n/cm 2 s) depending, in turn, on the type of the fuel used. Vibrocompacted MOX fuel with a plutonium weight content of ∼ 38 % has been adopted currently as the standard MBIR fuel. The capabilities offered by the use of alternative highly dense fuel types in this reactor appear to be promising for the future large-scale nuclear power. The most attractive fuel types for advanced fast reactors are mixed nitride uranium–plutonium fuel and mixed metallic fuel (a three-component uranium-plutonium-zirconium alloy). Studies on the MBIR reactor, involving advanced dense fuel types, have shown that nitride fuel does not make it possible to achieve the required neutron flux value, while metallic fuel provides for the required neutron flux (practically the same as MOX fuel) and a high dpa rate but requires modified temperature conditions of irradiation. The specific neutronic properties of these fuel types, as compared to the standard MOX fuel, have also been identified...|$|R
