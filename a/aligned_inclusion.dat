40|$|Glacial {{hydrology}} {{plays an}} important role in the motion and melt of glaciers. The transport of water through glacial ice is still poorly understood. Previous studies show that much of the water is stored and routed through planar voids within the glacier. From borehole observations and previous radar surveys, the voids appear to have a preferential orientation. Transverse waves, including radar waves, and shear seismic waves, travel at different velocities when polarized at different orientations relative to <b>aligned</b> <b>inclusions.</b> I conducted two georadar surveys on Bench glacier, in the Chugach Mountains, AK. Bench glacier has been the field site of a collaborative effort to characterize these englacial voids, and their role in glacial hydrology. Since georadar velocity is commonly used to estimate glacial water content, it is important to know the orientation of the voids relative to the georadar olarization, in any estimation of the water content. From mixing models with <b>aligned</b> <b>inclusions,</b> I was able to estimate the degree of velocity anisotropy expected from water filled voids in glacier ice. Surveys over the same area conducted with different polarizations, yielded velocity estimates that were measurably different. The first survey was conducted in 2006. This was a large multi-offset multiazimuth 3 D survey. The grid was surveyed in three directions to measure the differences in the radar wave velocities due to orientation. This survey not only provided estimates of velocities in over 3000 locations, but also produced a 3 D volume showing englacial structure. The distribution of velocities in each direction was statistically different and showed an anisotropic velocity field that agreed with the theory and previous observations on Bench glacier. The second survey was a common midpoint survey conducted in 2008. This survey was designed to quickly test for and give an estimate of subsurface anisotropy. I collected common midpoint gathers with three different antenna configurations in five different directions. By doing so, I was able to sample the same part of the glacier with waves with different polarizations. Again this survey showed measurable anisotropy with the fastest velocity occurring when the wave was polarized perpendicular to the long axis of the voids. Both surveys show measurable anisotropy greater than the uncertainty in the velocity estimates. If preferentially <b>aligned</b> <b>inclusions</b> are suspected, it is necessary to assume an anisotropic velocity model. By assuming an isotropic velocity model, volumetric water content estimates ranged from 0 % to 8 %. By assuming an anisotropic model, the water content estimate is better constrained and found to be 1. 2 %. In this work, I demonstrate how to survey and determine velocity anisotropy resulting from <b>aligned</b> <b>inclusions</b> and the importance of an anisotropic velocity model for estimating water content in temperate glaciers...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe present work aims at {{determining}} a micromechanical {{model for}} the elastoplastic behavior of anisotropic metal-matrix composites reinforced by <b>aligned</b> <b>inclusions.</b> The microstructure of the studied material – hydrided and irradiated Zircaloy- 4 cladding tubes – {{is supposed to be}} made of an anisotropic and elastoplastic matrix (irradiated Zircaloy) containing <b>aligned</b> isotropic elastic <b>inclusions</b> (hydrides). The homogeneous behavior of this non-linear two-phase material is obtained by a linearization model based on the modified secant method (Ponte Castañeda and Willis, 1995). The behavior of the linear comparison composite is estimated by the model of Ponte Castañeda and Willis (1995). The anisotropy of the macroscopic behavior rises both from the shape of the inclusions and from the plastic anisotropy of the matrix. The model is compared to three-dimensional numerical simulations and experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Media {{containing}} <b>aligned</b> rotationally symmetrical <b>inclusions</b> show {{transverse isotropy}} {{with respect to}} elastic wave propagation. The characteristics {{of this type of}} anisotropy have been investigated {{in the first part of}} this thesis (chapters 2, 3, and 4) while its implications on Vertical Seismic Profiling have been investigated in the second part of this thesis (chapters 5, 6, and 7). Transverse isotropy due to <b>aligned</b> <b>inclusions</b> has been studied for inclusions ranging from flat cracks (very small aspect ratio a.) up to spheres (a. = 1) using Nishizawa's model (chapter 2). The resultant anisotropy as described by this model (which is based on a static approach) is identical to the anisotropy described by Hudson's crack model (based on the scattering of elastic waves) for inclusions with aspect ratios up to 0. 3. This result, which is surprising because Hudson's model has been derived for small aspect ratios (a. < 1), implies (assuming the validity of Nishizawa's model) that Hudson's model which is often used to interpret anisotropy observations can be applied to much larger aspect ratios than the aspect ratios for which it has been derived. Another characteristic of the anisotropy as described by Nishizawa's model is that almost spherical inclusions (a. =:: 1) result in elliptical anisotropy, which is a type of anisotropy that can never be due to sequences of thin isotropic layers. Sequences of isotropic layers and systems of large aligned fractures are just like <b>aligned</b> <b>inclusions</b> possible causes of transverse isotropy. Although these fractures and sequences of isotropic layers have a geometry that is different from the geometry of <b>aligned</b> <b>inclusions</b> they may result in the same anisotropy as <b>aligned</b> <b>inclusions</b> (chapters 3 and 4). The model describing the anisotropy due to large aligned fractures turns out to be identical to Hudson's crack model, whereas the model describing the anisotropy due to fine layering is identical to Hudson's model for ranges of aspect ratios that strongly depend on the fluid inside the inclusions. For the situations that these models are similar observed anisotropy can only be interpreted in terms of crack distributions if additional information shows the existence of cracks. However, for the situations where the similarity does not hold it is possible to distinguish between the causes of transverse isotropy (chapter 4). It should be realized, however, that other causes of transverse isotropy exist. Therefore, the 'separation' method described in this thesis should only be considered as a first step towards distinguishing between the causes of transverse isotropy. Because the 'representability' of cracked media by finely layered media strongly depends on the fluid inside the cracks, this 'representability' might not only be an interesting way to distinguish between the causes of transverse isotropy, but might also be an useful tool to investigate the nature of the fluid. Considering an uniformly cracked medium monitoring the nature of the fluid as a function of time or space could be very important for earthquake prediction or gas exploration, respectively. Studying anisotropy observations is a powerful way to obtain information about the internal structures of the rocks (such as <b>aligned</b> <b>inclusions,</b> thin layering) which have dimensions much smaller than the seismic wavelength used. Studying crack-induced anisotropy offers the possibility to monitor the stress-field that aligns the cracks. There is evidence that a changing stress strongly affects the aspect ratio of the cracks. The results of the first part of this thesis on the effect of a changing aspect ratio on crack-induced anisotropy have been used to develop methods to interpret anisotropy observations in multi-offset shear-wave VSPs in terms of a changing aspect ratio. Changes in the aspect ratio can be monitored in such VSPs (chapter 6) by studying the changes in the direction of wave propagation at which there is no shear-wave splitting. This technique which has been applied to synthetic shear-wave VSPs could become important if repeated VSPs are carried out to analyze temporal changes in anisotropy in terms of a changing stress-field. Although shear-wave splitting is often used as a key identifier of anisotropy one should be aware that shear-wave splitting can also be caused by transmission effects at interfaces in isotropic media (chapter 5). This effect should be taken into account first before shear-wave splitting is interpreted in terms of anisotropy. Anisotropy may give valuable information about the internal structures of rocks, but it may also lead to erroneous interpretations, when it is not properly taken into account. In chapter 7 this has been shown for an isotropic traveltime inversion scheme which, when applied to multi-offset VSP traveltime data in layered transversely isotropic media, may introduce errors in the depths of the interfaces separating the layers. Therefore, anisotropy should be included in inversion schemes. In a first attempt to develop inversion schemes that do take anisotropy into account a transversely isotropic traveltime inversion scheme has been developed and successfully applied to synthetic multi-offset VSP-data. The method developed is a robust method and further research is necessary to develop more elegant methods. Despite the robustness of the method the results of the transversely isotropic traveltime inversion scheme show, when compared with the results of the isotropic inversion scheme, that both an isotropic and a transversely isotropic model can explain the same traveltime data set (consisting of the arrival times of P- and first arriving S-waves). To attack this problem of non-uniqueness additional information (such as polarization, shear-wave splitting) should be incorporated in the inversion...|$|R

40|$|Seismic {{attenuation}} in fluid-saturated porous rocks {{can occur}} by geometric spreading, wave scattering or the internal dissipation of energy, most {{likely due to}} the squirt-flow mechanism. In principle, the pattern of seismic attenuation recorded on an array of sensors contains information about the medium, in terms of material heterogeneity and anisotropy, as well as material properties such as porosity, crack density, and pore-fluid composition and mobility. In practice, this inverse problem is challenging. Here we provide some insights into the effects of internal dissipation by analysing synthetic data produced by a hybrid numerical and analytical model for seismic wave propagation in a fractured medium embedded within a layered geological structure. The model {{is made up of}} one anisotropic and three isotropic horizontal layers. The anisotropic layer consists of a porous, fluid-saturated material containing vertically <b>aligned</b> <b>inclusions</b> representing a set of fractures. This combination allows squirt-flow to occur between the pores in the matrix and the model fractures. Our results show that the fluid mobility and the associated relaxation time of the fluid-pressure gradient control the frequency range over which attenuation occurs. This induced attenuation increases with incidence angle and azimuth away from the fracture strike-direction. Azimuthal variations in the induced attenuation are elliptical allowing the fracture orientations to be obtained from the axes of the ellipse. These observations hold out the potential of using seismic attenuation as an additional diagnostic in the characterisation of rock formations for a variety of applications including hydrocarbon exploration and production, subsurface storage of CO 2, and geothermal energy extraction...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} remain open to other {{possibilities}} for the origin of myrmekite, I report the following two sites in this presentation in which bulbous myrmekite {{on the border of}} perthitic orthoclase is suggested by other investigators to form by exsolution. Weinsberg (Moldanubian) Granite, Austria At the first site, the Weinsberg (Moldanubian) granite and an older quartz-monzonite facies of the South Bohemian pluton in Austria both contain orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene and must have crystallized from magmas at high temperatures. The granite contains orthoclase megacrysts (as much as 10 to 20 cm long), which (1) are chemically zoned with Ba-rich cores (1 to 2 % mol Cs; and locally as much as 6 to 8 % Cs) and (2) are mineralogically zoned with <b>aligned</b> <b>inclusions</b> of plagioclase whose subhedral to euhedral faces are parallel to potential faces of the orthoclase (from illustrations at poster session, III Hutton Symposium, Koller and Kloetzli, 1995; personal communication, Koller, 1996). The megacrysts are perthitic and locally are bordered by small bulbous myrmekite with tiny quartz vermicules. Plagioclase lamellae are absent in the orthoclase adjacent to the myrmekite. The myrmekite is also associated with symplectic biotite which Koller and Kloetzli (1995) suggest is formed by the breakdown reaction orthopyroxene + K-feldspar + water = biotite + quartz. Discussion Koller (personal communication at the Hutton Symposium, 1995) suggested that the myrmekite bordering the orthoclase megacrysts was formed by exsolution. If that is true, it should have contrasting characteristics with myrmekite formed by K-metasomatism. For example, myrmekite formed by exsolution should be associated with orthoclase, whereas myrmekite formed by K-replacement would most commonly be found bordering microcline rather than orthoclase (although myrmekite borders orthoclase in a few localities, such as the Cooma granodiorit...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the development of a constitutive theory for porous and composite materials, which is capable of predicting, approximately, the evolution of the microstructure and its influence on their effective response under general three-dimensional finite-strain loading conditions, such as those present in metal-forming operations. The theory is general enough to be used for linearly viscous, nonlinearly viscous and perfectly plastic composites with randomly oriented and distributed ellipsoidal inclusions (or pores), which, in the most general case, can change size, shape and orientation. In addition, the 2 ̆ 2 shape 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 orientation 2 ̆ 2 of their center-to-center statistical distribution functions can also evolve with the deformation. To illustrate the key features of the theory, the effective response of several two-phase systems, essentially consisting of random distributions of <b>aligned</b> <b>inclusions</b> (or pores) in different matrix materials, is considered under various loading conditions. The results show that the evolution of the relevant microstructural variables, as well as the effective response, depend in a complex fashion on the initial state of the microstructure, {{as well as on the}} specific boundary conditions. In particular, it is observed that the evolution of the microstructure can have significant implications for the flow strength and ultimate failure of the heterogeneous systems. For instance, for the case of composite materials composed of perfectly plastic constituents, or for the case of porous materials with a perfectly plastic matrix, the evolution of the microstructure could lead to failure by shear localization. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the theory for manufacturing-related applications, the constitutive model was implemented numerically using the finite element method, and applied to plane-strain and axisymmetric extrusion of initially uniform, isotropic porous metals. The results obtained suggest that the properties of the final product and the forces required to carry out the manufacturing process can be significantly affected by the resulting highly nonuniform, anisotropic changes in the microstructure. ...|$|R

The stiffness of a SMC panel with known state of fiber orientation is calculated using FEM. The influence of process induced fiber orientation is analysed. The fiber orientation for a realistic charge pattern for the panel has been obtained through mould filling simulation in a separate project. It is found that the fiber orientation has a rather small impact on the global stiffness. Only 0. 8 % lower stiffness compared to isotropic material model is obtained {{taking into account the}} fiber orientation distribution. The main reason for the low impact of the process induced fiber orientation is that the charge is symmetrically placed in the mould leading to a symmetric fiber orientation distribution.

40|$|A {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} for predicting the effective conductivities of heterogeneous media containing ellipsoidal inclusions of diverse shapes, spatial distributions, and orientations. This scheme yields explicit expressions for the effective conductivity tensor {{in terms of}} three microstructural parameters that characterize the shape, distribution, and orientation of the inclusions. By expanding the effective conductivity tensor {{in terms of the}} volume fraction of the inclusions, it is found that the effect of the shape of the distribution ellipsoid on the effective conductivity tensor is of a higher order in the volume fraction than the effect of the shape of the inclusions. The scheme proposed here generalizes the Maxwell formula to heterogeneous media containing multiple inclusions while also taking into account the orientation of the inclusions. Thus, the existing formulas in the literature are special cases of the general formulas given by the present scheme.

In literature, a widely dealt topic is that of calculating the overall permittivity of a dispersion of dielectric spheres in a homogeneous matrix: the well-known Maxwell formula solves the problem in the case of very diluted suspensions. Moreover, this relationship has been adapted, to yield correct results even if the dispersion in not strongly diluted, by means of the so-called Bruggeman’s procedure. In this paper, we apply this technique to perform a complete study on the equivalent permittivity of a dispersion of ellipsoids. The obtained solutions allow us to evaluate the effects of the shape of the inclusions on the overall electric behaviour of the mixture. In particular we find explicit expressions, which give the equivalent permittivity of the medium in terms of the eccentricities of the embedded ellipsoids and of some stoichiometric parameters. The treatment is carried out both for <b>aligned</b> ellipsoidal <b>inclusions</b> and for randomly oriented ellipsoids.

Differences in the microgeometry of the ceramic/polymer matrix with 0 - 3 connectivity and the presence of two piezo-active components with contrasting piezoelectric and mechanical properties lead to a considerable dependence of the piezoelectric performance, hydrostatic response and related parameters of the 1 - 0 - 3 composite on the aspect ratio and volume fraction of the <b>aligned</b> ceramic <b>inclusions.</b> The influence of the elastic anisotropy of the ceramic/polymer matrix on composite properties with changes in the aspect ratio and volume fraction of the inclusions is discussed.

Each {{of the thousands of}} microborings observed in 60 brachiopod fragments has changed shape by forming calcite partitions that have divided the original tubules into separate <b>aligned</b> fluid <b>inclusions.</b> On average, only 35 % of the original lengths of the microborings are preserved as fluid inclusions; values range from less than 5 % to about 85 %.

Preservation of parallel walls, fillings with luminescent calcite and high salinity of included fluid indicate that open-system cementation is the other mechanism responsible for alteration of the microborings. As most inclusions have leaked and refilled or stretched during thermal re-equilibration, these fluid inclusions are not particularly reliable as records of diagenetic history.

40|$|Seismic {{anisotropy}} {{across the}} Hikurangi subduction zone measured from shear-wave splitting exhibits strong lateral changes over distances of about 250 km. Teleseismic S-phases show trench-parallel fast polarisations with increasing delay times across the forearc and arc region. In the arc region, delay times reach up to 4. 5 s, {{one of the}} largest delay times measured in the world. Such large delay times suggest strong anisotropy or long travel paths through the anisotropic regions. Delay times decrease systematically in the backarc region. In contrast, local S-phases exhibit a distinct change from trench-parallel fast orientations in the forearc to rench-perpendicular in the backarc, with average delay times of 0. 35 s. In the far backarc, no apparent anisotropy is observed for teleseismic S-phases. The three different anisotropic regions across the subduction zone are interpreted by distinct anisotropic domains at depth: 1) In the forearc region, the observed "average" anisotropy (about 4 %) is attributed to trench-parallel mantle flow below the slab with possible contributions fromanisotropy in the slab. 2) In the arc region, high (up to 10 %) frequency dependent anisotropy in the mantle wedge, ascribed to melt, together with the sub-slab anisotropy add up to cause the observed high delay times. 3) In the far backarc region, the mantle wedge dynamic ends. The apparent isotropy must be caused by different dynamics, e. g. vertical mantle flow or small-scale convection, possibly induced by convective removal of thickened lithosphere. The proposed hypothesis is tested using anisotropicwave propagation in two-dimensional finite difference models. Large-scale models of the subduction zone (hundreds of kilometres) incorporating the proposed anisotropic domains of the initial interpretation result in synthetic shear-wave splittingmeasurements that closely resemble all large-scale features of real data observations across the central North Island. The preferred model constrains the high (10 %) anisotropy to the mantle wedge down to about 100 kmunder the CVR, bound to the west by an isotropic region under the western North Island; the slab is isotropic and the subslab region has average (3. 5 %) anisotropy, down to 300 km. This model succeeds in reproducing the constant splitting parameters in the forearc region, the strong lateral changes across the CVR and the apparent isotropy in the far backarc region, as well as the backazimuthal variations. The influence of melt on seismic anisotropy is examined with different small-scale (tens of kilometres) analytical modelling approaches calculating anisotropy due to melt occurring in inclusions, cracks or bands. Conclusions are kept conservative with the intention not to over-interpret the data due to model complexities. The models show that seismic anisotropy strongly depends on the scale of inclusions and wavelengths. Frequency dependent anisotropy for local and teleseismic shear-waves, e. g. for frequency ranges of 0. 01 - 1 Hz can be observed for <b>aligned</b> <b>inclusions</b> on the order of tens of meters. To test the proposed frequency dependence in the recorded data, two different approaches are introduced. Delay times exhibit a general trend of - 3 s/Hz. A more detailed analysis is difficult due to the restricted frequency content of the data. Future studies with intermediate frequency waves (such as regional S-phases) are needed to further investigate the cause of the discrepancy between local and teleseismic shear-wave splitting. An additional preliminary study of travel time residuals identifies a characteristic pattern across central North Island. Interpretation highlights the method as a valuable extension of the shear-wave splitting study and suggests a more detailed examination to be conducted in future...|$|R

Thomsen's (1986) anisotropy parameters (e, 7, 6) have been calculated at each stress level during the cracking and crack closing cycles using Nishizawa's (1982) theory. Test results indicate that anisotropy in the P-wave velocity is greater and more sensitive to the presence of aligned cracks than that observed for S waves. Modelling studies show that the P-wave anisotropy parameter is always greater than that of anisotropy parameter 8,for low crack densities and for small aspect ratios.

A {{major part of the}} work conducted involves the investigation of the effective damage responses due to damage evolutions of matrix microcracks and fiber breakages. Chapter 3 presents the effective elastic damage behavior of continuous fiber reinforced composites with evolutionary matrix microcracks. A cohesive penny-shape microcrack model is proposed within a two-step homogenization framework to achieve the effective elastic damage behavior of continuous fiber reinforced composites. In the proposed model, the size and the number density of microcracks are defined as two damage parameters to control the matrix microcrack evolution. In addition, the thermal effect is taken into account by taking advantage of the thermal eigenstrain and the Eshelby's equivalent inclusion principle. The overall coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the composite is systematically derived under the framework of micromechanics to describe the overall damage behavior of composites due to matrix microcrack evolution under temperature changes. Chapter 4 proposes a micromechanical evolutionary damage framework capable of predicting the overall mechanical behavior of and damage evolution in continuous fiber reinforced composites. In the framework, the effective stress fields in a single fiber due to an embedded penny-shaped fiber breakage are systematically derived by applying the double-inclusion theory. The notion of effective length denoting the distance between two adjacent breakages is introduced as a damage parameter while determining the damage evolution within a single fiber. This enables the modeling of the effective damage behavior of a single-fiber reinforced composite. As an application of the proposed framework, a micromechanical damage model is further proposed to simulate the fiber-dominated failure mechanism within a multi-fiber composite. A Weibull probability function is adopted to estimate the varying volume fractions of damaged fibers and intact fibers. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. In Chapter 5, based on the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and ensemble-volume averaging technique, an effective eigenstrain is newly proposed to quantify the homogenized stress fields in a single fiber due to multiple fiber breakages. In the proposed model, the number density evolution of fiber breakages is characterized by a two-parameter Weibull statistic with the temperature effect implicitly enclosed by properly adjusting the Weibull parameters. The damage criterion in the evolutionary damage model is theoretically derived. Utilization of the proposed damage framework, a homogeneous damage evolution model capable of simulating the material behavior of multi-fiber reinforced composite materials is developed. Chapter 6 presents two stochastic risk-competing models to simulate the fiber breakage evolution in a multi-fiber composite with an inhomogeneous fashion by considering different load sharing mechanisms. A unit cell model is adopted with each cell being assigned an initial weakness based on a normal distribution. Damage evolution inside each cell structure follows the micromechanical model presented in Chapter 5. Two risk-competing models are introduced subsequently to determine the damage sequence within the multi-fiber composite by computing the fracture probability based on the weakness of cells at each time step. It is observed that one risk-competing model tends to generate a concentrated damage pattern with broken fibers clustering in a T-shape or a cross-shape, while the other model yields a more diffused damage pattern. Finally, the overall stress-strain responses and the fiber breakage evolution are predicted and verified against experimental data. Chapter 7 examines the effective elastoplastic behavior of metal matrix composites (MMCs) containing unidirectionally aligned continuous fibers. A homogenization procedure is utilized to derive the overall yield function for the composite based on the probabilistic spatial distribution of <b>aligned</b> <b>inclusions.</b> Based on continuum plasticity, a plastic flow rule and a hardening law are postulated. These laws together with the proposed overall yield function then characterized the macroscopic elastoplastic behavior of the composite under three-dimensional arbitrary loading/unloading histories. The overall uniaxial elastoplastic stress-strain behavior of MMCs with aligned continuous fibers is investigated. Comparisons between theoretical predictions and experimental data for the composite are performed to illustrate the capability of the proposed method. Chapter 8 concludes the present research on micromechanics and effective elastic and elastoplastic behavior of continuous fiber reinforced MMCs. Finally, related future research topics are discussed briefly...|$|R

Current research on inclusion focuses on student outcomes and procedural changes and not the contexts and capabilities of education leaders who are implementing it. Empirical research that examines how schools have built the capacity for sustaining these models, especially through the perspectives of those who implement it, is limited to date. The purpose of the current study was to examine in depth one school 2 ̆ 7 s capacity development during their own inclusive education reform.

40|$|The Pelona Schist in the San Gabriel Mountains, {{southern}} California, {{formed in}} the Laramide subduction channel, exhibits multiple phases of deformation/metamorphism and provides valuable insights into the rheological properties of the subduction channel. Petrological and microstructural analysis indicates that the Pelona Schist has undergone three major deformational/metamorphic events. Subduction of volcanic and sedimentary protoliths during D 1 was recorded by <b>aligned</b> mineral <b>inclusions</b> in albite and epidote porphyroblasts. Metamorphic temperature and pressure {{at the end of}} subduction yielded by Raman spectroscopy of carbonaceous material and phengite barometry were 519  ±  20  °C and 10. 5  ±  0. 4  kbar, respectively. During D 1 the dominant deformation mechanism was quartz pressure solution, and the estimated shear stress at the end of D 1 was less than 10  MPa. D 2, the first stage exhumation of the Pelona Schist along the upper section of the subduction channel during return flow, was recorded by retrogressive metamorphism, isoclinal folding, and a pervasive schistosity that wraps around earlier porphyroblasts. Metagreywacke was deformed mainly by quartz pressure solution and metachert was deformed dominantly by dislocation creep during D 2. The shear stress in metagreywacke was less than 10  MPa and that in metachert was between 8. 3  +  2. 7 /−  1. 5 and 12. 9  + . 9 /−  2. 3  MPa, resulting in a strain rate of 1. 4  [*]×[*]  10 − 13 to 5. 5  [*]×[*]  10 − 13  s − 1. A topography driven model is proposed as the main driving force of D 2 exhumation. D 3 records normal-sense movement on the Vincent Fault, which separates the schist from overlying arc and continental basement. This resulted in the second stage of exhumation, creating a major synform and associated mylonitic fabric in the upper section of the Pelona Schist. Conditions at the beginning of D 3 were 390  ±  13  °C and 5. 8  ±  0. 8  kbar given by the TitaniQ thermometer and phengite geobarometer.

40|$|A {{composite}} {{model is}} proposed {{to describe the}} time-dependent response of the Earth's lower crust. The motivation for such it model is twofold: First, new observations of widespread postseismic deformation indicate that the deep continental crust responds viscoelastically, having both long-and short-term decay times. Second, by any number of observationally based rationales, the lower crust is compositionally and structurally heterogeneous over many length scales. For heterogeneities that have much smaller characteristic lengths than the minimum deformation wavelength of interest, the aggregate rheology can be described by composite media theory. For wavelengths {{of the order of}} the thickness of the lower crust (approx. = 25 - 40 km) and larger, composite theory may be applied to heterogeneities that are smaller than about several hundred meters, or equivalent to the vertical extent of a thick lower crustal mylonitic shear zone. The composite media theory developed here is constructed using both Eshelhy-Mori-Tanaka theory for <b>aligned</b> generalized spheroidal <b>inclusions</b> and a generalized self-consistent method. The inclusions and matrix are considered to be Maxwellian viscoelastic: a rheology that is consistent with past homogeneous models of postseismic stress relaxation. The composite theory presented here introduces a transient response to a suddenly imposed stress field which does not appear in homogeneous Maxwell models. Analytic expressions for the amplitude and duration of the transient and for the effective long-and short-term viscosities of the composite are given which describe the sensitivity to inclusion concentration (phi), to shape, and to ratio of inclusion-to-matrix viscosity (R) ...|$|R
40|$|Fine {{extinction}} bands (FEBs) (also {{known as}} deformation lamellae) visible with polarized light microscopy in quartz {{consist of a}} range of nanostructures, inferring different formation processes. Previous transmission electron microscopy studies have shown that most FEB nanostructures in naturally deformed quartz are elongated subgrains formed by recovery of dislocation slip bands. Here we show that three types of FEB nanostructure occur in naturally deformed vein quartz from the low-grade metamorphic High-Ardenne slate belt (Belgium). Prismatic oriented FEBs are defined by bands of dislocation walls. Dauphiné twin boundaries present along the FEB boundaries probably formed after FEB formation. In an example of two sub-rhombohedral oriented FEBs, developed as two sets in one grain, the finer FEB set consists of elongated subgrains, similar to FEBs described in previous transmission electron microscopy studies. The second wider FEB set consists of bands with different dislocation density and fluid-inclusion content. The wider FEB set is interpreted as bands with different plastic strain associated with the primary growth banding of the vein quartz grain. The nanometre-scale fluid inclusions are interpreted to have formed from structurally bounded hydroxyl groups that moreover facilitated formation of the elongate subgrains. Larger fluid <b>inclusions</b> <b>aligned</b> along FEBs are explained by fluid-inclusion redistribution along dislocation cores. The prismatic FEB nanostructure and the relation between FEBs and growth bands have not been recognized before, although related structures have been reported in experimentally deformed quartz. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|An {{explicit}} micromechanics-based nonlocal {{constitutive equation}} is derived that relates the ensemble averages {{of stress and}} strain for macroscopically transversely isotropic elastic composites consisting of a matrix containing a random distribution of <b>aligned</b> impenetrable spheroidal <b>inclusions</b> or voids. The analysis builds on and generalizes previous models developed by the authors [Drugan, W. J., Willis, J. R. 1996. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 48, 1359 - 1387; Monetto, L, Drugan, W. J., 2004. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 52, 359 - 393) wherein elastic composites containing spherical and randomly oriented spheroid-shaped inclusions were analyzed. One advance involves derivation of a closed-form statistical characterization of the aligned spheroidal microstructure that is valid for the full physically attainable range of inclusion volume fractions. This was accomplished by applying a simple scale transformation to a sensible model of the microstructure, {{without the use of}} rigid "security spheres". An explicit micromechanics-based nonlocal constitutive equation is derived by employing this statistical characterization. This constitutive equation is then employed to explore the nonlocal effects of both shape and orientation of inclusions on the macroscopic response of the composite. Finally, quantitative estimates of the characteristic internal length of the random material are derived for the extreme cases of spheroidal voids and rigid particles; this length is indicative of the minimum representative volume element (RVE) size needed for a standard local composite constitutive equation sensibly to characterize the composite's overall response. Among the results, it is found that this minimum volume element size must be substantially larger for accurate description of composites containing aligned stiff spheroids as compared with those containing randomly oriented spheroids or spherical particles...|$|R

It is my opinion that the strategic imperative behind success in mining industry is responsible mining. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine how an effective HR strategy can be a competitive advantage that contributes to the success of a mining project in the global mining industry.

40|$|The {{twenty-first century}} society fights against an {{inherent}} tendency to over-classify and label people. In {{the case of}} the aged, despite all efforts, the perception of the helpless, feeble older person still prevails. The {{truth of the matter is}} that people over sixty often do not fit this profile. The aged are a heterogeneous group with varying different skills and abilities in many different areas. This paper challenges prevalent mobile phone design decisions that appear to have been made based on the erroneous pre-conception of the incapable elder. Designers currently produce “senior” mobile phones that are, at best, inadequate and, at worst, insulting to a sector of society that deserves respect and consideration. Age does indeed influence mobile phone usage, and people over sixty often have specific and special needs, quite apart from age-related limitations, that predict their use of mobile phones. Most mobile phones designed for older users simply reduce the number of features: the so-called simplification approach. Apart from reducing the effectiveness of the phone, this approach often incorporates the fatal design flaw of using numbers or letters, on speed-dial buttons, which requires the user to remember the button–person mappings. In fact, this design rationale reduces the value of the phone to the user. This paper argues that mobile phone design for older users should be worth-centred (Cockton G in Designing worth is worth designing. In: Proceedings of the 4 th Nordic conference on human–computer interaction: changing roles. Oslo, Norway, pp 165 – 174, 2006) rather than simplification-driven. The worth-centred approach maximises worth to the user of the phone. This is achieved by maximising effectiveness while accommodating reduced capabilities. To maximise ease of use, and consequent accessibility, features may have to be reduced in an informed way. To facilitate this, a mapping process is proposed whereby user needs are linked to uses of the phone, and then to the features that facilitate these uses. Needs fall into a number of categories, and each category is characterised by a number of different uses, which form a usage space. Features can be linked to one or more usage spaces, and thus be used to support needs. The first step in the conducted research entailed the identification of the needs of the older mobile phone user. Then, it was determined whether these needs were indeed being met by the uses afforded in existing phones. Having concluded that most users’ needs were not being met, the next step was to capture data on the needs, limitations and expectations of people over the age of sixty. This was achieved by conducting a series of one-to-one interviews with a number of older mobile phone users and also supervising a participatory design experiment. Using the findings of the analysis, a usage space model is proposed, which serves to <b>align</b> feature <b>inclusion</b> with user needs. Based on this usage space model (the theoretical contribution), a prototype mobile phone design is presented as the practical contribution of the paper...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the spall properties of aluminum-magnesium (Al-Mg) alloys. Aluminum alloy 5083 (Al 5083) {{was used as a}} model alloy for the work performed in this study. Al-Mg alloys represent a light-weight and corrosion resistant alloy system often used in armor plating. It is desirable to process armor plate material to yield a microstructure that provides maximum resistance to spall failure due to blast and projectile impacts. The blast and impact resistance has often been quantified based on the measurement of the spall strength and the Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL). The spall properties of Al-Mg alloys were measured for four different microstructural states resultant from varying processing conditions. The four microstructures include: (a) textured grain structure from a rolled Al 5083 -H 116 plate, (b) sub-micron grain structure produced using equi-channel angular pressing (ECAP),(c) equiaxed grain structure, and (d) precipitation hardened microstucture from an Al- 9 wt. % Mg alloy. The overall results show that grain size is not the most dominant microstructural feature affecting spall strength in aluminum alloys, when the impact conditions are the same. Texture, especially if brittle <b>inclusions</b> <b>align</b> along the grains, appears to have the most dominant effect resulting in decreased spall strength. Furthermore, one-dimensional modeling shows that the inclusion size and distribution is the controlling factor for void formation during spalling. Grain size does affect the decompression rate dependence of each microstructure, whereby smaller grain sizes result in a larger power law exponent for fits of spall strength versus decompression rate. Unlike the spall strength, the HEL shows an increasing trend with decreased grain size, as would be expected from a Hall-Petch type effect, indicating that a smaller grain size is best for penetration resistance. Samples processed using ECAP alone provide the best combination of spall strength and HEL and therefore the most promise for improved blast and penetration resistance of aluminum-magnesium alloy armor plates.
