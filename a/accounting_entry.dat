5000|$|In the double-entry {{accounting}} system, {{at least two}} <b>accounting</b> <b>entries</b> are required to record each financial transaction. These entries may occur in asset, liability, equity, expense, or revenue accounts. Recording of a debit amount {{to one or more}} accounts and an equal credit amount to one or more accounts results in total debits being equal to total credits for all accounts in the general ledger. If the <b>accounting</b> <b>entries</b> are recorded without error, the aggregate balance of all accounts having Debit balances will be equal to the aggregate balance of all accounts having Credit balances. <b>Accounting</b> <b>entries</b> that debit and credit related accounts typically include the same date and identifying code in both accounts, so that in case of error, each debit and credit {{can be traced back to}} a journal and transaction source document, thus preserving an audit trail. The rules for formulating <b>accounting</b> <b>entries</b> are known as [...] "Golden Rules of Accounting". The <b>accounting</b> <b>entries</b> are recorded in the [...] "Books of Accounts". Regardless of which accounts and how many are impacted by a given transaction, the fundamental accounting equation of assets equal liabilities plus capital will hold.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: This {{thesis is}} about how the <b>accounting</b> <b>entry</b> {{provisions}} are linked to corporate market value. By statistically examining accounting and share data for 56 companies listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm, {{the question of whether}} accounting information regarding provisions are value relevant for investors is studied. Listed companies shall follow the rules of IAS 37 – Provisions, Contingent liabilities and Contingent assets, when preparing financial statements. Aim: The purpose of this thesis is {{to examine the relationship between}} reported information about provisions and investors assessment of listed companies that comply with IFRS-regulations, by statistically testing the value relevance of the <b>accounting</b> <b>entry.</b> Method: The study is based on a quantitative, deductive methodological approach. The value relevance of provisions is examined by statistically testing the collected empirical data based on the two models that is described in the reference frame. Results: The conclusion to be drawn from the study is that reported provisions have no statistically significant association with return on shares and thus is not value relevant. The study shows a correlation between reported earnings and returns, which is in line with previous studies. Suggestions for future research: Based on the statistical tests, the study has revealed that the <b>accounting</b> <b>entry</b> provisions are not value relevant for investors. Something that could be interesting to further explore is why provisions are not value relevant. I also think it would have been interesting to closer examine which components of the reported results that are related to the return on the company's shares. A suggestion could be to examine this by combining a quantitative statistical study with qualitative interviews to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships that might arise...|$|E

They are a pure <b>accounting</b> <b>entry.</b> They are named as such in the FMA, but they could also have been named ‘inflating expenses’ because it is their role: AD just inflate expenses without any corresponding outflow of cash (i.e. without any increase in E*). Following Stolowy and Breton (2004), they must be considered a form of creative accounting {{in spite of their}} legality, since the reported balance no longer truly presents the reality. For any given level of operating revenues, cash-draining operating expenses and true depreciation, AD deteriorate the reported balance of the statement of financial performance: BR[*]=[*]R −[*](E*[*]+[*]D[*]+[*]AD) where BR refers to the reported balance of the statement of financial performance, i.e. the one published in accounts and marred by AD.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} components of the balance sheet of a property-casualty insurance company is the loss reserve. In spite of what the term may suggest, a loss reserve is not a pot of funds set aside for the uncertain future. It is an <b>accounting</b> <b>entry,</b> a liability on the balance sheet. More precisely termed the unpaid-losses account, the loss reserve expresses the amount the company expects to pay out in the future to cover indemnity payments that will come due on policies already written for losses that have already been incurred and to cover the costs of dealing with the associated claims. The latter category of costs, which includes, for example, the litigation costs associated with settling claims, is called loss-adjustment expenses. I If loss reserves were determined {{solely on the basis of}} pure insurance-accounting theory, they would reflect only those factors that affect the size, frequency, and pattern of future claim payments and loss-adjustment expenses.

40|$|A cost {{transfer}} is an <b>accounting</b> <b>entry</b> that transfers costs between accounts to correct an accounting or clerical {{error in the}} original entry. A proper system of internal financial accounting control with respect to cost transfers dictates that such accounting entries be properly documented, explained and appropriate under the circumstances. In addition, Federal regulations and Cost Accounting Standards require that such transfers be treated consistently across all University funding sources. II. Scope This guideline establishes the requirements for recording cost transfers on the financial accounting records of the University in accordance with a proper system of internal financial accounting control and Federal regulations. The guideline also establishes {{the responsibility of the}} Principal Investigator (PI) to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the cost transfers made to or from their sponsored project accounts. In addition, the Departmental Administrator is responsible to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the cost transfers made to or from departmental funds. The University’s cost transfer guideline applies to all faculty and staff who record cost transfers on the accounting records of the University. It also applies to all sources of University funding including unrestricted, restricted, endowment, and plant funds. III. Guideline An appropriate cost {{transfer is}} made when the charge qualifies as a bona fide cost of the sponsored project or indirect activity being charged. Typically, cost transfers are appropriate when their purpose is to: • correct an accounting or clerical error in the original charge • reallocate resources between accounts for reasons other than covering an over or under expenditure of budgeted costs • transfer pre-award costs in the limited circumstances under which some sponsors will accept such costs according to the provisions o...|$|E
40|$|The Migration Act {{requires}} that a non-citizen who is detained {{is liable to}} pay the Australian government the costs {{of his or her}} detention. This liability includes costs for the transportation of the person to and from an immigration detention centre and the daily maintenance amount for each day the person spends in detention. In certain circumstances, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) may write off a person’s debt where it has been determined uneconomical to pursue. Additionally, a person may apply to the Department of Finance and Deregulation (Finance) to request a waiver of their debt. A write off does not extinguish the debt owing to the Australian government: it is merely an <b>accounting</b> <b>entry</b> and the recovery of the debt may be pursued at a later date. By contrast, a debt that is waived cannot be reinstated and is extinguished for all time. A non-citizen who has a debt owing to the Australian government may be refused a visa and/or be prevented from entering Australia at a later date if the debt has not been paid or if appropriate arrangements have not been made to repay the debt. Complaints to the Ombudsman’s office highlighted some inconsistencies with DIAC’s administration of debts. Some people complained about significant delay in processing a waiver request. In other cases {{there was a lack of}} comprehensive and timely information provided by DIAC about the debt waiver and write-off process. In July 2007, the Ombudsman initiated an own motion investigation to examine DIAC’s administration of debt waiver and write-off. Overall, the Ombudsman’s investigation found that DIAC is administering debt waiver and write-off according to the legislative and policy requirements. However, the investigation also found scope for improvement. In particular, DIAC can improve the information it provides to people, timeliness and prioritisation in processing cases, and the consistency and reasonableness of decisions on debt waiver and write-off...|$|E
