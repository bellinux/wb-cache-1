5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the mysteries developed after Isis's Hellenized cult reached Greece itself, later in the third century BCE. Much of the early evidence of Isis worship in Greece comes from aretalogies, poems in praise of the goddess. The wording of aretalogies from Maroneia and Andros, both from the first century BCE, closely links Isis with mystery rites. Petra Pakkanen says that these aretalogies prove the mysteries of Isis existed by that time, but Jan Bremmer argues that they only connect Isis with the Eleusinian Mysteries, not with distinctive rites of her own. Stronger evidence for mysteries of Isis {{is found in the}} first century CE, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> existed in the second. Temples to Isis in Greece may have developed their mysteries in response to the widespread belief that the Greek mystery cults had originated with Isis and Osiris in Egypt. They could have adapted elements of Eleusinian rites, and perhaps Dionysian mysteries as well, to reflect Egyptian mythology. The end product would have seemed to the Greeks like an authentic Egyptian precursor to Greek mysteries. Many Greco-Roman sources claim that Isis herself devised these rites.|$|E

Rhizomes {{may be able}} to survive and spread in drier conditions than stolons. The downside of this donor is that it is more distantly related to cultivated rice and the crosses and backcrosses are much more difficult to make. Descendents of the few successful crosses are mostly infertile, and few were perennial. Interestingly, many of the perennial plants lacked rhizomes. Rhizomes may not be essential for survival, but they may help plants survive stress <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> help them spread.|$|E

While there, he addressed a local Democratic Committee, reminiscing about his childhood and how his adopted mother overcame alcoholism. He also discussed his policy on the Iraq War, advocating devolving control to the Iraqi government: [...] "It's their country, it's their future and they should be willing to fight for it <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> should be willing to die for it."

As the conversation shifted focus to the Roger Rabbit sequel, Zemeckis stated that the sequel [...] "moves the story of Roger and Jessica Rabbit into {{the next few years}} of period film, moving on from film noir {{to the world of the}} 1950s". He also stated that the sequel would feature a [...] "digital Bob Hoskins", as Eddie Valiant would return in [...] "ghost form". While the director went on to state that the script is [...] "terrific" [...] and the film would still utilize hand-drawn animation, Zemeckis thinks that the chances of Disney green-lighting the sequel are [...] "slim".

500|$|In 870 Dumbarton was {{besieged by}} Amlaíb Conung and Ímar, [...] "the two kings of the Northmen", who [...] "returned to Dublin from Britain" [...] the {{following}} year with numerous captives. It is therefore likely that Scandinavian hegemony was already significant on the western coasts of Scotland by then. Amlaíb Conung is described as the [...] "son of the king of Lochlainn" [...] in the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland and Ó Corráin (1998) argues that Lochlainn [...] "is Viking Scotland and probably includes Man" [...] at this time suggesting an early date for an organised Kingdom of the Isles. In the same source Amlaíb Conung is also recorded as having gone {{to the aid of}} his father Gofraidh, who was under assault from Vikings in Lochlainn in about 872. Gofraidh died in 873 and may have been succeeded briefly by Ímar who also died that year. Amlaíb probably died in 874. A lament for Áed mac Cináeda, a Pictish king who died in 878, suggests Kintyre may have been lost to his kingdom at that time. The Norse may have taken the Isle of Man in 877 <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> held it by 900. In 902 the Vikings were expelled from Dublin for up to a dozen years, and a year later Ímar, the [...] "grandson of Ímar" [...] was killed in battle with the forces of Constantine II in mainland Scotland. [...] However these events were setbacks for the Norse rather than a definitive moment. Internecine fighting is recorded in the Annals of Ulster of 914, which describe Ragnall ua Ímair's defeat of Bárid mac Oitir in a naval battle off the Isle of Man.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} these ships was very {{controversial}} {{while they were}} being built in the 1870s, with many articles being published in the newspapers of the day by supporters and detractors, and later picked up by historians. One such account, published in 1875, claimed that Novgorod made an uncontrollable turn while on the Dniepr, while Reed, describing {{a time when the}} ship's engines on one side were reversed during a cruise in Sevastopol Bay, wrote: [...] "The circular form is so extremely favourable to this kind of handiness that the Novgorod can easily be revolved on her centre at a speed which quickly makes one giddy. She can, nevertheless, be promptly brought to rest, and, if, needed have her rotary motion reversed." [...] It would seem probable that the two reports quoted above were combined into the story as given by Fred T. Jane: [...] "On a trial cruise, they (Novgorod and [...] ) went up the Dniepr very nicely for some distance, till they turned to retire. Then the current caught them, and they were carried out to sea, whirled helplessly round and round, every soul on board helplessly incapacitated by vertigo." [...] The other criticisms made by Preston have been discussed earlier and the opinion of naval historian Stephen McLaughlin is a reasonable assessment of these ships: In the final analysis, the popovkas seem to have been relatively effective coast-defence vessels; certainly their combination of armament and armour could have only been carried by a conventional ship of much greater draught. Their faults – <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> had faults — were exaggerated by critics, both in Russia and abroad, and have left as a legacy stories of uncontrollable ships designed by incompetent men.|$|E

[...] Deeley wasn't surprised by the Universal response: [...] "The Deer Hunter was a United Artists sort of picture, whereas Convoy was more in the style of Universal.
