Supporters of lynching justified the practice as a way to assert dominance over <b>African</b> <b>Americans,</b> to whom they attributed a criminal nature. Lynching also provided a sense of white solidarity in a culture with changing demographics and power structures. Although lynching was tolerated by much of southern society, opponents of the practice emerged, including some religious leaders and the nascent National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).|$|E

40|$|Scholars of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> {{religion}} {{have done}} well to note the poignant role of cultural productions in the making, doing, and theorizing of religion and life options. Lacking in this discourse is critical attention to the religious significance of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> quilts, the quilters who make them, and the quilt-making process as source material {{for the study of}} <b>African</b> <b>American</b> religion. This dissertation adopts and thinks with the work of Anthony B. Pinn’s definition of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> religion as the quest for complex subjectivity, a desire or feeling for life meaning. Through a multi-disciplinary approach that draws on religious studies, sociology and art criticism/art history, the dissertation asserts that some <b>African</b> <b>American</b> quilters use scraps of mundane materials to craft visual testimonies that link the quest for complexity to everyday life. Research from the analyses allows scholars to gain deeper insight into the role of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> quilts in the expression of religion, and consider the cultural production of quilts as legitimate and viable source material for the study of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> religious life. Quilting Faith: <b>African</b> <b>American</b> Quilts as Source Material for the Study of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> Religion reveals that <b>African</b> <b>American</b> quilts are just as important to understanding <b>African</b> <b>American</b> religion as music, drama, dance, poetry, and slave narratives...|$|R
40|$|While {{mentoring}} {{has been}} promoted as the effective way to improve outcomes among at-risk students, there remain {{a number of problems}} for the mentoring of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students. There has been a growing concern that too many <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students continue to underperform in high school. This has greatly jeopardized their chances of attending college. The primary problem is that studies indicate that <b>African</b> <b>American</b> at-risk students are best mentored by <b>African</b> <b>American</b> staff persons, especially <b>African</b> <b>American</b> principals, but there is a dearth of research on the subject. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the influence of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> male high school principal mentors on the behavior and self-esteem of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> male at-risk high school students.

40|$|The <b>African</b> <b>American</b> man is {{destroyed}} physically or psychologically in many literary works {{because he is}} disliked and/or because of choices he makes. What is intriguing is that <b>African</b> <b>American</b> women writers Zora Neale Hurston and Alice Walker, in particular, destroy <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men characters in selected works even though they experienced oppression similar to the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> man {{as a result of}} race and sex. In making decisions to destroy their <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men characters physically and psychologically, these writers did not discount the goodness that the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> man possessed. In directly and indirectly expressing their rational for destroying the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> man, Walker and Hurston both were socially and culturally aware that he must be restored. Hurston and Walker are similar in technique, but they both bring their unique stance in their rationale for destroying their <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men characters. It is obvious that both have problems with the behaviors and/or attitudes of the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> man because of the oppression that each writer experienced with <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men personally. Hurston, through Their Eyes, seems to be more fixed in her perspective of the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> man than Walker. Although both writers see the antagonism in the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> man, Hurston seems to believe that <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men are affected by the negative past so much so that it becomes a fixed part of them, so they will always possess negative tendencies. Hurston as a writer during the 1920 s through the 1950 s was more focused on declaring herself and women in general as the most powerful sex, but she was aware that we must build up the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> man, and she indicated this through Their Eyes. Walker's The Third Life of Grange Copeland and The Color Purple speak highly of Walker's character in reference to the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> man. Even though each text is written years apart, Walker did not shift in her perspective. Walker was consistent in her physical or psychological destruction and revival of the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> man. Walker had to ability as a writer to do what her forerunner Hurston could not do through her text Their Eyes. She did not reveal that she was permanently damaged as a woman/writer {{as a result of her}} negative personal situations with <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men. She revealed that there was a need for the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> man, and her role as a woman and writer was to assist him in his plights. Hurston and Walker cannot be totally condemned as <b>African</b> <b>American</b> women writers for their rationale for destroying the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> man because I believe they were trying to alter others' perspective of the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> man. Their selected works bring awareness or remind the world that <b>African</b> <b>American</b> women today have to prune themselves against the negative and potential negative traits of their sons, brothers, husbands and/or fathers. The novels also have the ability to bring about conviction in some <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men as they recognize the negative attitudes and behaviors of the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men characters in these texts, and perhaps force the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> man to circumcise his heart and mind so he can increase his love for himself and those around him.
