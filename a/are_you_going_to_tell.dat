[...] "You’ve got {{to give me a}} really damn good reason why somebody, who is in the prime of their career and are doing really good work, why on earth they should stop? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a male who {{is at the top of}} his game in whatever domain, that he needs to step down and retire?". Speaking to series creators Michelle Grace Hunder and Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore, Arena goes on to talk about the importance of female solidarity, mentioning how competition between women can be (and has been) dismantled by supportive relationships and encouragement of other women. Arena says [...] "Get out of the ring. Take your boxing gloves off. Be convinced in the argument of your thoughts and your dreams".|$|E

How <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> presuppose that a {{girl like}} Miss Pasmer is {{interested}} in an idiot like you? I mean me, of course." [...] Mavering broke off with a dolorous laugh. [...] "And if you can't presuppose it, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do {{when it comes to}} the point? You've got to shillyshally, and then you've got to go it blind. I tell you it's a leap in the dark." ...|$|R

[...] "But tell us privately, William, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> depend on a {{straight}} ball and speed, or <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give them some curves and fadeaways?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the noodles}} are {{traditionally}} eaten at weddings, the expression [...] "When <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> feed us guksu?"

6000|$|... 'I thought so. There was a {{dishonesty}} {{about your}} dear eyes {{which has never}} been there before, and love-making and dishonesty are inseparable as coupled hounds.

6000|$|... "Mr. Maraton," [...] he said, [...] "now I {{am going}} to ask you this question. To-morrow you go to Manchester to {{pronounce}} your doctrines. To-morrow you are going to incite the working people of England practically to revolt. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them that it is for posterity they must strike? Do you mean, when you thunder at them from the platforms, to tell them the truth?--to tell them that the good which you promise is not for them nor for their children, nor their children's children, but for the unborn generations?

6000|$|... "Do as you're bid, will you, {{and give}} me the whisky. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me when I'm to eat and when I'm to drink, like a child?" [...] This he said in that tone of voice which made Mrs. Moulder know that he meant to be obeyed; and though she was sure {{that he would make}} himself drunk, she was {{compelled}} to minister to his desires. She got the whisky and hot water, the lemon and sugar, and set the things beside him; and then she retired to the sofa. John Kenneby the while sat perfectly silent looking on. Perhaps he was considering whether {{he would be able to}} emulate the domestic management of Dockwrath or of Moulder when he should have taken to himself Mrs. Smiley and the Kingsland brick-field.|$|E
6000|$|America {{has given}} us {{an example of this}} in her {{political}} system; perhaps she will now oblige in her educational. I confess that I look very eagerly and watchfully towards America in many ways. After the war she will be more emphatically than ever, in material things, the most important and powerful nation of the earth. We British have a legitimate and somewhat breathless interest in the use she will make of her strength, {{and in the course of}} her national life, for this will greatly influence the course of our own. But power for real light and leading in America will depend, not so much on her material wealth, or her armed force, as on what the attitude towards life and the ideals of her citizens are going to be. Americans have a certain eagerness for knowledge; they have also, for all their absorption in success, the aspiring eye. They do want the good thing. They don't always know it when they see it, but they want it. These qualities, in combination with material strength, give America her chance. Yet, if she does not set her face against [...] "Gadarening," [...] we are all bound for downhill. If she goes in for spreadeagleism, if her aspirations are towards quantity not quality, we shall all go on being commonised. If she should get that purse-and-power-proud fever which comes from national success, we are all bound for another world flare-up. The burden of proving that democracy can be real and yet live up to an ideal of health and beauty will be on America's shoulders, and on ours. What are we and Americans going to make of our inner life, of our individual habits of thought? What are we going to reverence, and what despise? Do we mean to lead in spirit and in truth, not in mere money and guns? Britain is an old country, still in her prime, I hope; but America is as yet on the threshold. Is she to step out into the sight of the world as a great leader? That is for America the long decision, to be worked out, not so much in her Senate and her Congress, as in her homes and schools. On America, after the war, the destiny of civilisation may hang for the next century. If she mislays, indeed, if she does not improve the power of self-criticism--that special dry American humour which the great Lincoln had--she might soon develop the intolerant provincialism which has so often been the bane of the earth and the undoing of nations. If she gets swelled-head the world will get cold-feet. Above all, if she does not solve the problems of town life, of Capital and Labour, of the distribution of wealth, of national health, and attain to a mastery over inventions and machinery--she is in for a cycle of mere anarchy, disruption, and dictatorships, into which we shall all follow. The motto [...] "noblesse oblige" [...] applies as much to democracy as ever it did to the old-time aristocrat. It applies with terrific vividness to America. Ancestry and Nature have bestowed on her great gifts. Behind her stand Conscience, Enterprise, Independence, and Ability--such were the companions of the first Americans, and are the comrades of American citizens to this day. She has abounding energy, an unequalled spirit of discovery; a vast territory not half developed, and great natural beauty. I remember sitting on a bench overlooking the Grand Canyon of Arizona; the sun was shining into it, and a snow-storm was whirling down there. All that most marvellous work of Nature was flooded to the brim with rose and tawny-gold, with white, and wine-dark shadows; the colossal carvings as of huge rock-gods and sacrificial altars, and great beasts, along its sides, were made living by the very mystery of light and darkness, on that violent day of spring--I remember sitting there, and an old gentleman passing close behind, leaning towards me and saying in a sly, gentle voice: [...] "How <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> it to the folks at home?" [...] America has so much that one despairs of telling to the folks at home, so much grand beauty to be to her an inspiration and uplift towards high and free thought and vision. Great poems of Nature she has, wrought in the large, to make of her and keep her a noble people. In our beloved Britain--all told, not half the size of Texas--there is a quiet beauty of a sort which America has not. I walked not long ago from Worthing to the little village of Steyning, in the South Downs. It was such a day as one too seldom gets in England; when the sun was dipping and there came on the cool chalky hills the smile of late afternoon, and across a smooth valley on the rim of the Down one saw a tiny group of trees, one little building, and a stack, against the clear-blue, pale sky--it was like a glimpse of Heaven, so utterly pure in line and colour, so removed, and touching. The tale of loveliness in our land is varied and unending, but it is not in the grand manner. America has the grand manner in her scenery and in her blood, for over there all are the children of adventure and daring, every single white man an emigrant himself or a descendant of one who had the pluck to emigrate. She has already had past-masters in dignity, but she has still to reach as a nation the grand manner in achievement. She knows her own dangers and failings, her qualities and powers; but she cannot realise the intense concern and interest, deep down behind our provoking stolidities, with which we of the old country watch her, feeling that what she does reacts on us above all nations, and will ever react more and more. Underneath surface differences and irritations we English-speaking peoples are fast bound together. May it not be in misery and iron! If America walks upright, so shall we; if she goes bowed under the weight of machines, money, and materialism, we, too, shall creep our ways. We run a long race, we nations; a generation is but a day. But in a day a man may leave the track, and never again recover it! ...|$|E

5000|$|On October 18, 2007, Stark {{made the}} {{following}} {{comments on the}} House floor during a debate with Congressman Joe Barton of Texas: [...] Republicans sure don't care about finding $200 billion to fight the illegal war in Iraq. Where {{are you going to}} get that money? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us lies like you're telling us today? Is that how you're going to fund the war? You don't have money to fund the war or children. But you're going to spend it to blow up innocent people if we can get enough kids to grow old enough for you to send to Iraq to get their heads blown off for the President's amusement. [...] Following the initial criticism to his statements, when asked by a radio station if he would take back any of his statements, Stark responded [...] "Absolutely not. I may have dishonored the Commander-in-Chief, but I think he’s done pretty well to dishonor himself without any help from me." [...] The same day, his office also issued a press release, saying in part: [...] I have nothing but respect for our brave men and women in uniform and wish them the very best. But I respect neither the Commander-in-Chief who keeps them in harms sic way nor the chickenhawks in Congress who vote to deny children health care." [...] Five days later on October 23, after the House voted down a censure resolution against Stark sponsored by Minority Leader John Boehner, he said: [...] I apologize for this reason: I think we have serious issues before us, the issue of providing medical care to children, the issue about what we’re going to do about a war that we’re divided about how to end.|$|E
5000|$|She {{became a}} member of a girl group named G.L.A.M. in 2009, and later joined B.C.G., another girl group. She filmed a music video as part of G.L.A.M. for a song titled [...] "JellyBean" [...] in 2009. During this time, Gomez also began {{recording}} herself singing and rapping songs using Garageband, and created a YouTube account to post covers of popular songs online. She also began writing her own songs, and by the age of thirteen had taught herself how to play guitar. Gomez befriended production duo The Jam when she was thirteen, who liked Gomez's written work. The trio began working on material together, resulting in the covers of the songs [...] "Otis" [...] (2011), [...] "Lighters" [...] (2011), [...] "Novacane" [...] (2011) and Take Care (2011). These songs were meant {{to be part of a}} mixtape, titled @itsbeckygomez, though this project never came to fruition. Her cover of [...] "Otis" [...] caught the attention of renowned producer Dr. Luke, who had worked with artists including Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus, among others. Luke scheduled a meeting with Gomez, and asked her to play guitar for him; he later signed her to his Kemosabe Records record label, through RCA Records. In reference to her video clip for [...] "Otis", Luke claimed [...] "I would have signed her off that video alone. I was 100 percent in. She has so much personality and her voice just pops out of the speakers. Then I met her and discovered she could also sing and play the guitar and I thought, 'This is even better.' Then I found out she could write and it was like, 'What else <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me, that you’re also Van Gogh?' Her potential is limitless." [...] Shortly after signing with the label, Gomez began work on her debut album.|$|E
