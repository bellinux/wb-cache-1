Polyethylene hot melts have high pot life stability, are not prone to charring, and are suitable for moderate temperature ranges and on porous non-flexible substrates. Nitrogen or carbon dioxide can be introduced into the melt, forming a foam which increases spreading and open time and decreases transfer of heat to the substrate, allowing use of more heat-sensitive substrates; polyethylene-based HMAs are usually used.

40|$|AbstractA theory {{parallel}} {{to that for}} blocking pairs of polyhedra is developed for <b>anti-blocking</b> pairs of polyhedra, and certain combinatorial results and problems are discussed in this framework. Blocking pairs of polyhedra are intimately related to maximum packing problems, <b>anti-blocking</b> pairs to minimum covering problems. Let B = {x ∈ R+n | Ax ≤ 1 }, where A is a non-negative matrix and 1 = (1,…, 1). The anti-blocker of the convex polyhedron B is defined to be the convex polyhedron B = {x ∈ R+n | x · B ≤ 1 }. It is shown that B = B and a method is described for finding a non-negative matrix B such that B={x ∈ R+itn | Bx ≤ 1 }. In particular, if A is the incidence matrix {{of a family of}} subsets of { 1,…, n} having the property that each subset of {{a member of the family}} is again a member of the family, a method is described for finding the facets of the convex hull of the rows of A. It is shown that <b>anti-blocking</b> pairs are characterized by a min-max equality, the analog of the max-flow min-cut equality for blocking pairs, or by a max-max inequality, the analog of the length-width inequality for blocking pairs. Finally, the theory of <b>anti-blocking</b> pairs is applied to certain problems in extremal combinatorics. A main result is the following. If A and B are an <b>anti-blocking</b> pair of (0, 1) -matrices, then the min-max equality holds strongly for both ordered pairs A, B and B, A, i. e., both covering problems yA ≥ w, y ≥ 0, min 1 · y, and yB ≥ w, y ≥ 0, min 1 · y, have integer solutions y for all integer vectors w. Conversely, if A is a (0, 1) -matrix with anti-blocker B, and if the min-max equality holds strongly for A, B, then all essential rows of B are (0, 1) -vectors.

The electric motor vehicle {{is different from the}} vehicle with traditionalinternal combustion engine because the former is equipped with one or more brushless DCmotors instead. Recently, research related to regenerative, short-circuit braking or brakingwith the aid of super capacitors has been mostly devoted to discussing the improvement ofbraking performance. However, as far as we are aware, none of the published documentaddressed the issue of anti-lock braking systems (ABS) for electrical motorcycles. An ABS isa safety mechanism for vehicles which prevents the wheels on a motor vehicle from lockingup (or ceasing to rotate) while braking. This project intends to develop a novel method forrealizing a non-mechanical ABS controller for electrical motorcycles based on the applicationof regenerative and short-circuit braking mechanism. Boundary layer velocity control will beproposed to ensure the optimal wheel rotating speed under the optimal slip ration between thetires and road. The <b>anti-block</b> braking controller controls the motor's low-side braking circuitto induce an effect of open or short circuit on the motor stator's coil to generate brakingactions similar to those in the conventional mechanical ABS control mechanism.

To fully realize the idea and verify its applicabilityin real world, a customized electrical scooter and a testing platform will be fulfilled as well. 電動機車的驅動有別於傳統內燃機，它是運用無刷直流馬達取代汽柴油引擎。由於電動機車馬力較小，傳統上大多採基本機械式輪鼓或碟式煞車。廣泛應用於汽柴油車輛之ABS 煞車控制機制，從未應用於電動機車。本計畫擬發展一創新概念，利用電動機車馬達由電動機轉發電機當加重負載產生負載效應的現象，來開發專屬於電動機車的ABS。將煞車系統透過對發電機的點放磁通短路來實現擬ABS 煞車動作，完全不需依賴傳統式液壓控制。最近國外研究電動機車的相關論文雖曾對回充煞車、短路煞車、動能煞車進行初步探討，文獻中未曾看到將電動機車煞車系統與防鎖死煞車系統整合的研究。本計畫擬以此為研究對象，提出一種創新的電子式煞車且兼具車輪轉速維持的防鎖死煞車系統。本計畫透過霍爾訊號對速度的變化建立車輪轉速模型，接著透過數位訊號處理器運算車速與輪速的滑差與理想滑差，且同時運用邊界層速度控制(boundary layer velocitycontrol) 設定安全滑差下對應的最佳車輪轉速，最後透過電子式煞車解調前後輪煞車力，必要時施放點放煞車命令。另外透過滑差值的運算，自動切換煞車模式，同時運用回充煞車可強化續航力與短路煞車力矩較大的特性，調節最佳煞車力。最後，本計畫將依上述原理真正研製一全球首創可實際上路使用的電動機車ABS 煞車系統控制器...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of {{electronics}} systems embedded in cars has dramatically increased. These devices control {{a large number of}} functionalities involving safety (e. g. <b>Anti-block</b> Braking System (ABS) control and Engine control), position (e. g. Global Position System (GPS)) or personal device connectivity (e. g. Bluetooth connection). Such an increased complexity of car electronics has made modern cars more vulnerable to cyber-attacks as there is a large number of potential access points given to a potential malicious entities. For this reason, the automotive industry is focusing towards the research of innovative security solutions to protect in-car systems. A valid approach to the current security demands in Automotive field is the Secure Hardware Extension (SHE) specified by the Hersteller Initiative Software (HIS) consortia, which encloses a set of useful functions for Automotive Security. The SHE improves a generic automotive microcontroller by the addition of a secure zone for the protection of cryptographic parameters (i. e. used in confidentiality-protected communications) and an authentication-based software environment. Therefore, it fulfills the recent needs of the automotive world in terms of confidentiality protection of data flowing over the various networks and a safe HW-SW interaction. In this work a flexible and efficient SHE module has been developed. The implemented SHE architecture consists of three major hardware sub-blocks: a cryptographic core, a cipher keys storage core and a control unit for interfacing with the external world such as a general purpose microprocessor. The cryptographic core is based on a flexible and efficient hardware implementation of the AES algorithm with the possibility of working with the Electronic Code Book (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) and Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) modes. On the other hand, the cipher keys that are contained within the SHE module can only be manipulated through specific secure interfaces. Furthermore, part of the work was the development of the software to control and verify the SHE functionality, making the HW/SW co-design a fundamental aspect of the project. The communication between the external processor and the system is an Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) bus, which interacts with the SHE by a memory-mapped interface. The novelty introduced by this thesis is the implementation of an efficient SHE and the addition of cryptographic functions as 256 -bits keys support for the AES. The involved cryptographic algorithms have been tested against the official test vectors provided by the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST). The prototype of the SHE was implemented on a Xilinx Zynq- 7000 board reaching a 148 MHz clock frequency. The occupation of the final system is lower than 5 % of the LUTs and 2 % of the registers available on the FPGA. The SHE module has also been synthesized on a 40 nm standard-cell CMOS technology at 210 MHz leading to a size of 236 Kgates. In terms of performance, the reachable throughput at 148 MHz frequency is 34 Mbps for ECB, 33 Mbps for CBC and 16 Mbps for CMAC mode...|$|R
30|$|The present work {{describes}} pretreatment {{processes of}} thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer (TPU) material, {{used as an}} adhesive in powder form, that results in the increased peeling resistance of joints. The TPU in powder form is an environmentally-friendly adhesive and provides safer bonding conditions in the shoe manufacturing industry. TPU particles are soft and require an <b>anti-blocking</b> agent to prevent agglomeration. However, particles covered by such an <b>anti-blocking</b> agent may account for a low peeling resistance in the resulting joints. To overcome this disadvantage, two pretreatment processes for the TPU adhesive were evaluated. The results of a two-step wet washing process, representing a conventional solvent-based procedure that involves both {{the application of a}} solvent and a powder separation step, are compared to the performance of a one-step dry plasma treatment process. The process type did not affect the size and agglomeration behavior of the particles, and both processes were effective in improving joint strength according to peeling test results. Spectroscopic investigation of the particle surface after washing or plasma treatment indicated some zinc concentration, which is interpreted to result from the <b>anti-blocking</b> agent. The crystallinity of the TPU, investigated by thermal analysis, was higher after pretreatment. The obtained results indicate that TPU in powder form is a versatile adhesive for the shoe industry with a safer application compared to solvent based adhesive systems.|$|E

Perfect graphs are, e. g., characterized as precisely those graphs G where the stable set polytope STAB(G) coincides with the clique constraint stable set polytope QSTAB(G). For all imperfect graphs STAB(G) ⊂ QSTAB(G) holds and, therefore, it is natural to measure imperfection {{in terms of the}} difference between STAB(G) and QSTAB(G). Several concepts have been developed in this direction, for instance the dilation ratio of STAB(G) and QSTAB(G) which is equivalent to the imperfection ratio imp(G) of G.

Malvenuto and Reutenauer (2011) introduced 'double posets', that is, (finite) sets equipped with two partial orders, as a generalization of Stanley's labelled posets. Many combinatorial constructions can be naturally phrased in terms of double posets. We introduce the 'double order polytope' and the 'double chain polytope' and we amply demonstrate that they geometrically capture double posets, i. e., {{the interaction between the}} two partial orders. We describe the facial structures, Ehrhart polynomials, and volumes of these polytopes in terms of the combinatorics of double posets. We also describe a curious connection to Geissinger's valuation polytopes and we characterize 2 -level polytopes among our double poset polytopes. Fulkerson's 'anti-blocking' polytopes from combinatorial optimization subsume stable set polytopes of graphs and chain polytopes of posets.

PVDF membranes were washed thoroughly with TBST 5 – 6 times, 5  min each. Blocking solution was used to dilute corresponding HRP-labeled secondary antibodies (Wuhan Boster Biological Engineering Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China). Membranes were then immersed in secondary antibody incubation media, incubated on a shaking bed {{at room temperature for}} 2  h. PVDF membranes were then sufficiently washed with TBST for 5 - 6 times, 5  min each. An appropriate amount of ECL substrate solution (Thermo, Shanghai, China) was added to each membrane and incubated for several minutes. After fluorescence bands were visible, developing and fixing solutions were added in turn. Each experiment was repeated three times. The densitometry of the targeted protein COX- 2 and reference bands were analyzed using a biological electrophoresis image analysis system, and the relative expression of the targeted protein was obtained by comparing the densitometry of the targeted bands and internal references for the same sample.|$|E
40|$|<b>Anti-blocking</b> system (ABS) brake {{controllers}} pose unique {{challenges to}} the designer: a) For optimal performance, the controller must operate at an unstable equilibrium point, b) Depending on road conditions, the maximum braking torque may vary over a wide range, c) The tire slippage measurement signal, crucial for controller performance, is both highly uncertain and noisy, d) On rough roads, the tire slip ratio varies widely and rapidly due to tire bouncing, and e) The braking system contains transportation delays which limit the control system bandwidth. A digital controller design was chosen which combines a fuzzy logic element and a decision logic network. The controller identifies the current road condition and generates a command braking pressure signal, based on current and past readings of the slip ratio and brake pressure. The controller detects wheel blockage immediately and avoids excessive slipping. The ABS system performance is examined on a quarter vehicle model with nonlinear elastic suspension. The parallelity of the fuzzy logic evaluation process ensures rapid computation of the controller output signal, requiring less time and fewer computation steps than controllers with adaptive identification. The robustness of the braking system is investigated on rough roads and {{in the presence of}} large measurement noise. This paper describes design criteria, and the decision and rule structure of the control system. The simulation results present the system 2 ̆ 7 s performance on various road types and under rapidly changing road condition...|$|E
40|$|Many {{countries}} and administrative domains exploit {{control over their}} communication infrastructure to censor online content. This paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of Kaleidoscope, a peer-to-peer system of relays that enables users within a censored domain to access blocked content. The main challenge facing Kaleidoscope is to resist the censor’s efforts to block the circumvention system itself. Kaleidoscope achieves blocking-resilience using restricted service discovery that allows each user to discover a small set of unblocked relays while only exposing {{a small fraction of}} relays to the censor. To restrict service discovery, Kaleidoscope leverages a trust network where links reflects real-world social relationships among users and uses a limited advertisement protocol based on random routes to disseminate relay addresses along the trust network; the number of nodes reached by a relay advertisement should ideally be inversely proportional to the maximum fraction of infiltration and is independent of the network size. To increase service availability in large networks with few exit relay nodes, Kaleidoscope forwards the actual data traffic across multiple relay hops without risking exposure of exit relays. Using detailed analysis and simulations, we show that Kaleidoscope provides> 90 % service availability even under substantial infiltration (close to 0. 5 % of edges) and when only 30 % of the relay nodes are online. We have implemented and deployed our system on a small scale serving over 100, 000 requests to 40 censored users (relatively small user base to realize Kaleidoscope’s <b>anti-blocking</b> guarantees) spread across different {{countries and}} administrative domains over a 6 -month period. ...|$|E
40|$|Conservation tillage (CT) {{is defined}} as a system of {{planting}} (seeding) crops into untilled soil by opening a narrow slot, trench or band only of sufficient width and depth to obtain proper seed coverage. No other soil tillage is done (Phillips and Young, 1973). This has been demonstrated and extended by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture (Gao et al., 1999) in the annual double-cropping (winter wheat - Triticum aestivum, L., and summer maize - Zea mays, L.) regions of northern China since 1997. No-till seeding of maize after wheat harvest has been achieved with increasing success in these regions and several small–medium-sized no-till maize seeders have been developed for these conditions (Li et al., 2000), but no-till seeding of wheat after maize harvest is still a problem (Gao et al., 2003). No-till wheat seeders, equipped with various kinds of maize residue <b>anti-blocking</b> mechanisms (e. g. strip-choppers, powered cutting discs), were designed to cut through maize stubble (Yao et al. 2009). In annual double-cropping regions of northern China, the strip-till seeder using a powered rotor to till shallow strips ahead of the seed opener is the most widespread option to plant crops into stubble, but with high power consumption and soil disturbance. This approach was shown to reduce soil water storage and retention capacity due to low residue cover on seedbeds (Wei et al., 2005), which does not conform to the principles of conservation agriculture. A power chain unit residue management attachment for a more conventional no-till seeder unit has since been developed to overcome these problems, and this paper reports a comparative evaluation of the powered-chain no-till seeder (PCNTS) and strip till seeder (STS). ...|$|E
