5|$|<b>At</b> <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> {{mentioned}} above, {{children play}} with sounds and learn methods {{to help them}} learn words. There is a relationship between children's prelinguistic phonetic skills and their lexical progress at age two: failure to develop the required phonetic skills in their prelinguistic period results in children's delay in producing words. Environmental influences may affect children's phonological development, such as hearing loss {{as a result of}} ear infections. Deaf infants and children with hearing problems due to infections are usually delayed in the beginning of vocal babbling.|$|E
30|$|How to {{calculate}} the motion equation of total population or labor population? Here, we follow Lu and Cai (2014)’s work and assume that fertility level is fully controlled by the fertility policy; under this condition, if we know policy fertility level for each period, and will also know initial population distribution and corresponding mortality <b>at</b> <b>each</b> age <b>stage,</b> we will also know future population distribution <b>at</b> <b>each</b> age <b>stage.</b> According to “ 2014 Chinese population and Employment Statistics Yearbook,” TFR is about 1.3 in 2013, that is TFR of maintaining the fertility policy unchanged, the policy TFR of universal two-child policy is about 2.0.We put population distribution in 2014 for different gender <b>at</b> <b>each</b> age <b>stage</b> as an initial population distribution and put mortality between 2003 and 2013 for different gender <b>at</b> <b>each</b> age <b>stage</b> as population update criteria. Firstly, we calculate population distribution for different gender <b>at</b> <b>each</b> age <b>stage,</b> we get {{the number of people}} <b>at</b> <b>each</b> age <b>stage</b> by the sum of the number of population for different gender for <b>each</b> age <b>stage,</b> and then we get the total population by adding the number of the population <b>at</b> <b>each</b> age group. Secondly, the number of newborn babies every year depends on the number of women of childbearing age (aged 15 – 49) and corresponding fertility level <b>at</b> <b>each</b> age <b>stage.</b>|$|R

5|$|Grasshoppers undergo {{incomplete}} metamorphosis: they repeatedly moult (undergo ecdysis), each instar becoming {{larger and}} more like an adult, with the wing-buds increasing in size <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>stage.</b> The number of instars varies between species but is often six. After the final moult, the wings are inflated and become fully functional. The migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes, spends about 25 to 30 days as a nymph, depending on sex and temperature, and lives for about 51 days as an adult.|$|E

5|$|Inland batik or batik kraton (Javanese court batik) is {{the oldest}} form of batik {{tradition}} known in Java. Inland batik has earthy colour such as black, indigo, brown, and sogan (brown-yellow colour made from the tree Peltophorum pterocarpum), sometimes against a white background, with symbolic patterns that are mostly free from outside influence. Certain patterns are reserved for royalty, while other are worn on specific occasions. At a Javanese wedding for example, the bride wears specific patterns <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> of the ceremony. Noted inland batiks are produced in Solo and Jogjakarta, cities traditionally regarded as the centre of Javanese culture. Batik Solo typically has sogan background and is preserved by the Susuhunan and Mangkunegaran Court. Batik Jogja typically has white background and is preserved by the Yogyakarta Sultanate and Pakualaman Court.|$|E

40|$|Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) {{design flow}} {{consists}} of several steps involved with Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. For an ASIC designer {{it is very}} important to know the status of design development. Finding the status of the actual design is currently a manual work. It is difficult to track the status and error information using log/report files generated by the tool at different stages of design flow. Therefore it is necessary to develop an automated tool to solve these issues and hence to reduce the designer effort significantly. In this paper smart data monitoring (dashboard) system is developed as an automated solution using PERL scripting language. The 8 -bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is designed for the verification of developed dashboard system. The log/report files are generated <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>stages</b> of the design. The information like errors, warnings, time of execution and report parameters are extracted from the design runs and stored in to database using the dashboard system. The stored design status information and report results are visualized in a single window dashboard view <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>stages</b> of the design flow. The developed dashboard system is generic and can be used for any kind of ASIC design. Thus monitoring multiple design products using dashboard, the time and effort required for checking design status is reducedsignificantly...|$|R
