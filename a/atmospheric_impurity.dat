The structural characteristics and electric field-induced properties of semiconductor NaBiTe 2 films with Cr contacts are investigated. Roomtemperature time {{dependence of the}} current flowing through the investigated structures under applied electric field is also discussed.

5000|$|He {{investigated}} {{the principle of}} action of many different gases. He investigated numerous mine disasters, especially the toxic gases which killed most miners after firedamp and coal dust explosions. The toxic mixtures of gases found in mines included afterdamp, blackdamp and whitedamp. His description of the way a flame safety lamp {{can be used to}} detect firedamp by the increase in height of the flame, and chokedamp by the dying of the flame, is a classic exposition in his textbook, Respiration. Although electronic gas detectors are now used widely in all coal mines, flame lamps are still used extensively for their ease and simplicity of operation. Electronic gas detectors rely on a catalytic chip which can be poisoned by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>impurities.</b>|$|R
40|$|Ice cores from Penny Ice Cap, Baffin Island, Canada, provide {{continuous}} Holocene {{records of}} oxygen isotopic composition (d 18 O, proxy for temperature) and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>impurities.</b> A time scale was established {{with the use}} of altered seasonal variations, some volcanic horizons, and the age {{for the end of the}} Wisconsin ice age determined from the GRIP and GISP 2 ice cores. There is pre-Holocene ice near the bed. The change in d 18 O since the last glacial maximum (LGM) is at least 12. 5 per mil, compared with an expected value of 7 per mil, suggesting that LGM ice originated at the much higher elevations of the then existing Foxe Dome and Foxe Ridge of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The LGM d 18 O values suggest thick ice frozen to the bed of Hudson Bay...|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} high {{temperature}} X-ray techniques the crystal structure of lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, ytterbium, and possibly gadolinium {{was found to}} be body-centered cubic at temperatures near their respective melting points. For ytterbium a hexagonal close-packed structure was also observed, which was shown to be stabilized by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>impurities.</b> Evidence for possible high temperature crystalline transformations in gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, and lutetium was obtained by means of electrical resistance measurements; erbium gave no such evidence. X-ray data were used to derive empirical equations which describe thermal expansions coefficients of scandium, yttrium and the rare-earth metals. Europium exhibits a rapidly decreasing coefficient of expansion with increasing temperature, which may be a consequence of a gradual promotion of one of the 4 f electrons into the conduction band. The hexagonal rare-earth metals were found to have nearly the same axial ratio at their respective transformation temperatures...|$|R
30|$|Discolouration due to metal {{corrosion}} {{is observed}} when composite artefacts of uncoated metal and porous stone {{are located in}} an outdoor environment [2 – 4]. The corrosion mechanism observed in connection with uncoated bronze statues and monuments is generally well understood [1, 2, 5]. The first step is oxidation of copper metal by atmospheric dioxygen (O 2), which creates a layer of cuprite (Cu 2 O), which in turn reacts with rain and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>impurities</b> to subsequently build up a layer of greenish patina [6 – 9]. The patina consists mainly of salts of basic copper(II) sulphates, such as brochantite (Cu 4 (SO 4)(OH) 6), {{and to a lesser}} extent of basic copper(II) chlorides like atacamite (Cu 2 Cl(OH) 3) [5 – 8] and in rarer cases also malachite (Cu 2 (CO 3)(OH) 2) [9]. Dissolution of the patina by rainwater transports the soluble ions to the nearby porous stone material, where reprecipitation occurs and greenish stains are subsequently formed in the pores and on the surface of the stone material [1, 2].|$|R
40|$|FLuorescence in Air from SHowers (FLASH) or E- 165 is an {{experiment}} {{to be carried}} out at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). It aims to measure the total and the spectrally resolved air fluorescence yield of electromagnetic showers with an accuracy of better than 10 %. The experiment explores the energy dependence of the yield down to the lowest energies effective in air showers, ∼ 100 keV. For this experiment, the SLAC linac will deliver a 28. 5 GeV electron beam at intensities of 107 to 109 particles per pulse. A thin target run will allow us to measure the fluorescence yield per beam track depending on pressure and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>impurities.</b> Later, the interaction of the beam in a thick target will mimic the distribution of electron energies found deep in cosmic ray induced air showers. In June 2002, a test experiment at SLAC measuring the total fluorescence of air and nitrogen between 300 and 400 nm in a thin target mode has proven the feasibility of such {{an experiment}}. Results of this test run will be presented. 1...|$|R
40|$|The pyrochemical {{conditioning}} of spent {{nuclear fuel}} {{for the purpose of}} final disposal is currently being demonstrated at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). One aspect of this program is to develop a lithium preprocessing stage for the Fuel Conditioning Facility (FCF). Furthermore, a pilot scale of this preprocessing stage is being designed by ANL-W to demonstrate the in situ hot cell capability of this process. In this pilot scale system, fused lithium chloride salt is saturated with molten lithium to form a powerful fluxing compound with a vigorous reducing agent. During this stage of the fuel conditioning, the reduction will take place at a nominal temperature of 650 C in an argon-cell atmosphere contaminated with up to 10, 000 ppm nitrogen, 100 ppm oxygen and 100 ppm of moisture. The maximum local temperature was calculated to be 725 C on the inner shell of the reduction vessel during operation. One of the significant concerns of this project is the system`s corrosion response in the presence of irradiated commercial fuel as well as <b>atmospheric</b> <b>impurities.</b> The purpose of this work was to demonstrate the potential corrosivity of the salt matrix in a worse case environment as well as provide a boundary for allowable impurities in the system during operation...|$|R
40|$|The pyrochemical {{conditions}} of {{spent nuclear fuel}} {{for the purpose of}} final disposal is being demonstrated at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). One aspect of this program is to develop a lithium preprocessing stage for the Fuel Conditioning Facility (FCF). One of the design considerations under investigation in this program is the system`s corrosion response in the presence of irradiated commercial fuel as well as <b>atmospheric</b> <b>impurities.</b> Static corrosion coupon tests have been completed which demonstrate the potential corrosivity of the salt matrix in a worse case environment as well as provide a boundary for allowable impurities in the system during operation. The literature concerning corrosion of either fused salts or molten metals consistently emphasizes three similar features which are common to both systems: (1) the overall corrosion rate is strongly dependent on temperature, impurity concentration and flow velocity; (2) many different mechanisms can be involved in a specific corrosion process; and (3) corrosion rates will significantly increase as all three of these independent variables are increased. The qualitative and quantitative understanding of these corrosion results is important for this spent fuel program since all of these variables will increase as the process scale increases. The purpose of this work was to determine if any data existed which could provide a quantitative expectation for corrosion rates of refractory metals in a lithium chloride salt bath...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{synthesis}} 2 –substituted– 4, 5 –diphenyl–N–alkyl imidazole derivatives. {{and evaluate}} their antibacterial activity. MethodsA mixture of benzil (10 mmol) and ammonium acetate (0. 1 mol) (immediately fused) in {{glacial acetic acid}} (25 mL) was stirred at 80 – 100 °C for 1 h under nitrogen atmosphere (to prevent incorporation of any <b>atmospheric</b> <b>impurities</b> and moisture). Substituted aldehydes (10 mmol) in glacial acetic acid (5 mL) was added drop-wise {{over a period of}} 15 – 20 min at the same temperature and stirred for another 4 h, the progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC test using ethyl acetate as eluent. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, 1 HNMR, 13 CNMR and by mass spectroscopy. ResultsAll the synthesized compounds were confirmed by spectroscopical techniques and evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus(S. aurius), Bacilus subtilus (B. subtilus), and Escheria coli (E. coli). These compounds showed antibacterial activity (zone of inhibition) against S. aurius ranged from 3 mm to 9 mmin diameter, B. subtilus, 4 – 8 mm, and E. coli 5 – 12 mm. Out of 2 a- 2 e, only 2 a and 2 b showed some sort of activity but none of them had considerable activity compared with that of the standard. ConclusionsAll the synthesized compounds show moderate activity against the tested bacteria S. aurius, B. subtilus, and E. coli. So, further structural modification is necessary to improve the antibacterial action of 2 -substituted- 4, 5 -diphenyl-N-alkyl imidazole derivatives...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} reduction of oxygen (O 2) {{has been studied}} on commercially-available integrated Pt thin-film electrodes (TFEs). Chemically reversible (but electrochemically quasi-reversible) cyclic voltammetry was observed in the room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([C 2 mim][NTf 2]), showing superior behaviour of TFEs compared to screen-printed electrodes for oxygen sensing. As a step towards the preparation of robust gas sensors, the RTIL was mechanically stabilised on the TFE surface {{by the addition of}} poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). At a PMMA concentration in the RTIL of ca. 50 % mass, electrolyte flow was not evident. O 2 reduction peak currents were found to decrease systematically with increasing PMMA content, reflecting the higher viscosity of the electrolyte medium. Linear calibration graphs were obtained for 0 – 100 % vol. oxygen at all PMMA–RTIL mixtures studied. The sensitivities decreased as [PMMA] increased, but the limits of detection were relatively unchanged. Mechanical stability of the sensors was tested in different orientations (flat, upside down, sideways) with both the neat RTIL and 50 % mass electrolyte. Whilst the electrochemical responses were dramatically changed for the neat RTIL, the responses in the PMMA–RTIL mixture were independent of electrode orientation. Additionally, the oxygen response in the PMMA–RTIL mixture was less affected by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>impurities</b> and moisture, compared to the neat RTIL. This suggests that these low-cost miniaturised devices can successfully be used for oxygen sensing applications in field situations, especially where portability is essential...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} fast and {{flexible}} method for the fabrication of Au nanocolumns. Au nanostructures were produced by pulsed laser deposition in air at <b>atmospheric</b> pressure. No <b>impurities</b> or Au compounds were {{detected in the}} resulting samples. The nanoparticles and nanoaggregates produced in the ablated plasma at atmospheric pressure {{led to the formation}} of chain-like nanostructures on the substrate. The dependence of the surface morphology of the samples on the deposition geometry used in the experimental set up was studied. Nanocolumns of different size and density were produced by varying the angle between the plasma plume and the substrate. The electrical, optical, and hydrophobic properties of the samples were studied and discussed in relation to their morphology. All of the nanostructures were conductive, with conductivity increasing with the accumulation of ablated material on the substrate. The modification of the electrical properties of the nanostructures was demonstrated by irradiation by infrared light. The Au nanostructures fabricated by the proposed technology are difficult to prepare by other methods, which makes the simple implementation and realization in ambient conditions presented in this work more ideal for industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|Pioneering {{studies of}} lead (Pb) {{concentrations}} in polar ice by Clair C. Patterson and co-workers (e. g. Murozumi et al., 1969; Boutron and Patterson, 1983, 1986) revealed important information on climatic changes dating {{many thousands of}} years in the past and the effect that humans have had on these pristine environments. Rosman and co-workers (e. g. Rosman et al., 1993, 1994 a) extended this research utilising the isotopic composition of Pb preserved in the ice to identify the source regions of both natural and anthropogenic Pb transported to the polar regions, thereby adding significantly to the understanding of atmospheric transport mechanisms and the impact of continental anthropogenic activity on the pristine polar environments. This thesis extends this area of research by investigating seasonal and short-term variability in Pb, Ba and In concentrations and Pb isotopes through the accurate sectioning of decontaminated glacial ice cores at high spatial resolution. This improves our understanding of the processes impacting on the deep ice core records, which, in turn, expands the interpretation and application of these records. A new sample preparation technique, incorporating a mechanised circular saw blade arrangement into the lathe design, first described by Candelone et al. (1994), has been developed to sample glacial ice cores at high spatial resolution with minimal contamination. This technique was extensively tested using artificially made ice cores, prepared from ultra-pure water, to quantify and minimise the Pb, Ba and In contamination associated with the process. The residual contamination in each inner core slice from the procedure amounted to 0. 2 ± 0. 2 pg Pb with [superscript] 206 Pb/[superscript] 207 Pb, [superscript] 208 Pb/[superscript] 207 Pb and [superscript] 206 Pb/[superscript] 204 Pb ratios of 1. 16 ± 0. 12, 2. 35 ± 0. 16 and 15. 3 ± 6. 7 respectively, 1. 5 ± 0. 4 pg Ba and 0. 6 ± 2. 0 fg In. This technique was then utilised to obtain high resolution analyses of Pb, Ba and In concentrations, and Pb isotopes in ice core sections recovered from Law Dome, East Antarctica and from the East Rongbuk Glacier on the northern slope of Mount Everest in the Himalaya. Law Dome, East Antarctic Holocene ice cores provide strong evidence for the transport of anthropogenic Pb from Australia to the Law Dome environment during the late 19 th century, with [superscript] 206 Pb/[superscript] 207 Pb and [superscript] 208 Pb/[superscript] 207 Pb ratios as low as 1. 061 ± 0. 001 and 2. 339 ± 0. 002 respectively, in close agreement with the Pb isotopic characteristics of Australian Broken Hill Pb ores. The onset of anthropogenic pollution of the Law Dome environment occurred in spring 1889 AD, associated with the onset of Pb ore smelting activities in Port Pirie, South Australia. Seasonal variability is most clearly seen in anthropogenic Pb and Ba (as a proxy for mineral dust) concentrations where peaks in concentrations generally occur in the autumn and spring periods, with consistently low concentrations during winter. Lead isotopic [superscript] 206 Pb/[superscript] 207 Pb ratios are inversely correlated with residual (anthropogenic + crustal) Pb concentrations with the lowest ratios occurring during periods of high Pb concentrations. The observed seasonal variability is associated with the annual cycle in position and strength of the Antarctic Circumpolar Trough, a region of low pressure situated off the coast of Antarctica, which moves closest to the Antarctic coast and increases in strength during the autumn and spring seasons. Concurrently, a strengthening of the Southern Ocean westerlies entrains and transports more <b>atmospheric</b> <b>impurities</b> from continental regions such as Australia. The low Pb concentrations and relatively more radiogenic [superscript] 206 Pb/[superscript] 207 Pb ratios that appear in the winter layers are indicators of aerosol inputs into the Law Dome environment from a well mixed Southern Hemisphere atmospheric background. Law Dome deep ice core sections, sampled at short-term resolution, show variability in all measured species over time indicating a general instability in temperature (as indicated by δ 18 O compositions) and environmental conditions (as indicated by elemental concentrations) prevailing during the periods of time integrated by the ice. Based on Pb isotopic [superscript] 206 Pb/[superscript] 207 Pb ratios, which reach values of 1. 225 ± 0. 004 and 1. 230 ± 0. 003 in glacial, and last glacial – Holocene transition ice respectively, noticeable volcanic Pb contributions are found to occur in both time periods, reaching as high as ~ 39 % and ~ 46 % respectively. These increases are associated with a decrease in mineral dust concentrations due to relatively warmer climatic conditions prevailing within the times integrated by the ice core sections. A link between temperature and environmental conditions in glacial ice is observed when changes in δ 18 O compositions (as a proxy for temperature) exceed 0. 24 ‰. In contrast, there is no link between temperature and environmental conditions during the last glacial – Holocene transition period, demonstrating a complicated climatic and environmental state existing at Law Dome at this time that incorporates aspects of both cold and warm climates. The high spatial resolution sectioning of continental glacial ice cores recovered from the East Rongbuk Glacier on the northern slopes of Mount Everest, and dated to the 18 th and 20 th centuries, has similarly shown variability in all measured species over time. Elemental Pb, Ba and In concentrations are very well correlated in all ice core sections confirming the environment of the East Rongbuk Glacier, within the investigated time periods, to be strongly controlled by the input of mineral dust. Isotopic [superscript] 206 Pb/[superscript] 207 Pb ratios in 18 th century ice range from 1. 18 – 1. 21 which are attributed to a natural mineral dust background devoid of any influences of anthropogenic [or volcanic] activity. During 18 th century monsoon periods (when mineral dust concentrations are generally low), local Himalayan material plays an important role on crustal inputs into the sampling region, with some inputs of Indian derived material possibly sourced to the Indian Peninsula, and Trans-Himalayan belt/Lhasa block material sourced to locations slightly north of Mount Everest. During non-monsoon periods (when mineral dust concentrations are generally high), it is likely that mineral dust from regions in northern Africa and central Asia are impacting on the high altitude Himalaya, with some possible contributions from the arid regions in north-western India and local Himalayan material. Based on elemental (Pb/Ba) and Pb isotopic ratios, there is no indication ofanthropogenic [or volcanic] Pb contributions in the 20 th century East RongbukGlacier ice core samples indicating that, prior to 1952 AD, the high altitude samplingsite was isolated from the effects of anthropogenic Pb pollution. Consequently, inthe 20 th century, Pb transported to the East Rongbuk Glacier site is sourced tomineral dust. An increase in elemental concentrations is observed in 20 th century ice,indicating increased mineral dust deposition relative to the 18 th century. Concurrently, a marked change in the isotopic characteristics of 20 th century ice coredata, relative to 18 th century ice core data, is observed, with a clear segregation ofmonsoon and non-monsoon data and the transition of 20 th century data to lessradiogenic values. This adjustment likely reflects environmental changes that haveoccurred from the 18 th to the 20 th centuries...|$|R
