25|$|The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{is adapted}} from the Inclusion of Others in the Self (IOS) Scale by Aron et al. (1992). The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{contains}} seven pairs of Venn diagrams that range in how far apart the circles are. In the first pair, there is no overlap but <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to the second, or third pair, the circles begin to overlap more and more. In the last pair (the seventh pair) the circles completely overlap. Participants respond to eight items by choosing the pair of circles that best denotes their connection with that particular item. A sample item is “The connection between you and a wild animal (such as a squirrel, deer, or wolf).” There are also eight other items to this scale that assess how connected participants feel to people. This scale shows acceptable reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.75) and validity (correlations with concern for environment). This scale is not contaminated with social desirability biases. The NR scale, the Allo-Inclusive scale, and the CN scale are highly correlated with one another suggesting they {{are all part of}} the nature connectedness construct.|$|E

[...] Casamassina and Mueller offered similar opinions, while Shepperd criticized the game's low camera angle and arbitrary targeting system. Bettenhausen dismissed the game's multiplayer mode as a failed adaptation of the Mario Party series. Fahey concurred, adding that a multiplayer racing mode would have been preferable to [...] "lame" [...] minigames. Casamassina compared the games to those in : [...] "only a handful of them really stand out and some are downright pointless, but overall gamers will probably be happy that they were included."

Desson Howe, {{in his review}} for the Washington Post, wrote, [...] "Soderbergh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan, who based this on a British television miniseries of the same name, have created an often exhilarating, soup-to-nuts exposé of the world's most lucrative trade". In his review for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers wrote, [...] "The hand-held camerawork [...] Soderbergh himself did the holdingprovides a documentary feel that rivets attention". However, Richard Schickel, in his review for Time, wrote, [...] "there is a possibly predictable downside to this multiplicity of story lines: they keep interrupting one another.

Scorsese first read the novel in 1989 and obtained the movie rights soon afterwards. When asked why he retained interest in the project for over 26 years, Scorsese stated: [...] "As you get older, ideas go and come. Questions, answers, loss of the answer again and more questions, and this is what really interests me. Yes, the cinema and the people in my life and my family are most important, but ultimately <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> older, there's got to be more... Silence is just something that I'm drawn to in that way. It's been an obsession, it has to be done... it's a strong, wonderful true story, a thriller in a way, but it deals with those questions." ...|$|E

If you are creative, you get busier <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> older." [...] Bennett continued to record and tour steadily, doing a hundred shows a year {{by the end of the}} 1990s. In concert Bennett often makes a point of singing one song (usually [...] "Fly Me to the Moon") without any microphone or amplification, demonstrating his skills at vocal projection. One show, Tony Bennett's Wonderful World: Live From San Francisco, was made into a PBS special. Bennett also created the idea behind, and starred in the first episode of, the A Network's popular Live by Request series, for which he won an Emmy Award. In addition to numerous television guest performances, Bennett has had cameo appearances as himself in films such as The Scout, Analyze This, and Bruce Almighty.|$|E
500|$|... "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] {{is written}} about divorce {{from the point}} of view of a {{helpless}} child. Its heavier sound was inspired by bands the group's members were listening to in the two weeks they wrote their fourth album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, such as Fugazi and Refused. Primarily written by guitarist Tom DeLonge, the song is biographical in nature. He and bassist Mark Hoppus were growing up when their parents divorced. For Hoppus, he was eight years old when he was sent to live with his father. [...] "The thing you realize <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> older is that parents don’t know what the hell they’re doing and neither will you when you get to be a parent.

Tom Hall {{was impressed with}} Brown's work, particularly music for the planet Democratus. Hall worked with musician Ron Jones and a local Dallas band to record the game's two funk numbers by mid-1998. Tom Hall planned for each character {{to have their own}} theme music, and for songs to change via interaction or exploration. He spoke of the planned music, [...] "The Anachronox sound will be industrial, mixed with forties bluesy swing. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> on later in the game, the music gets scarier, more chaotic, and gets down to hard-core metal." [...] Developers integrated DirectMusic support in 1999 to allow dynamic changing of background music. Sound programmer Henrik Jonsson implemented 3D sound and other capabilities using the Miles Sound System. Developers also planned to use software called Magpie Pro to lip-sync animated mouths to spoken words. The team chose not to record voices for each line of dialogue, as Tom Hall felt certain speech would become repetitive. The Undermain Theatre group of Dallas provided several voices. Tom Hall voiced PAL-18 reportedly because [...] "no one else got it goofy enough".|$|E

[...] When EastEnders began in 1985 viewers had watched Den's affairs and manipulation gradually take their toll on his wife, Angie, who was unable {{to compete in the}} games he played. Chrissie was intended to be a contrast to her predecessor; where Angie turned to alcohol, Chrissie was more Den's [...] "equal" [...] and could be just as devious and calculating, with Oberman observing how [...] "Angie was all knee-jerk reaction, but Chrissie is more of a plotter and schemer – just like Den." [...] Comparing Den's two wives, Oberman remarked: [...] "Chrissie's much cooler than Angie. Her motto is, 'revenge is a dish best served cold'. She's tougher than Angie and she can hold it together much better." [...] Indeed, according to Oberman, producers deliberately wanted to take Den's second marriage down a different path to his first; whereas the relationship between Den and Angie had been likened to Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, that between Den and Chrissie was modelled on Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Like Den, Chrissie had an acerbic tongue and their relationship was marked by verbal fencing in the manner of Hepburn and Tracy: [...] "What's great is that they've written Den an equal", Oberman noted, [...] "It'll be interesting to see their little sparring matches." [...] The attraction was intended to be mutual, unlike Den's one-sided marriage to Angie. Trying to win Chrissie around into giving their marriage another try, Den declared: [...] "I know we've got a great relationship even when we're tearing lumps out of each other, you give as good <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> and that's the sort of marriage I've always wanted".
