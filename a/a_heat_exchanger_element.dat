40|$|HTR-TN {{has been}} created in 2000 for {{building}} a coherent partnership {{for the development of}} HTR technology in Europe. For that purpose, HTR-TN elaborated a roadmap for {{the emergence of a new}} generation of industrial HTRs and is widely contributing to the implementation of the first steps of this roadmap. Through 9 coordinated contracts obtained in the 5 th EURATOM Framework Programme (FP 5), HTR-TN recovered the basis of past European HTR experience, addressed key feasibility issues for Generation IV high temperature systems and made significant advances in the fields of reactor physics (improved calculation methods), fuel (high quality fabrication and very high burn-up behaviour), waste management, qualification of materials for higher performance, component development and definition of safety approach for modular HTRs. In the 6 th Framework Programme (FP 6), a new integrated project, RAPHAEL, continues the technology developments addressed in FP 5 and explores solutions for improving HTR performances towards higher temperatures (above 900 °C) and burn-up (up to 200 GWd/tHM) – the VHTR objective. Moreover HTR-TN initiated other complementary actions in FP 6. The RAPHAEL project has launched key experiments for HTR development: continuation of the graphite irradiation programme started in FP 5 in HFR to higher fluences and temperature, test of <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>element</b> in a helium loop (HE-FUS 3, ENEA), irradiation of representative fuel coating material samples for modelling the evolution of their properties, fuel accident heat-up tests in the KÜFA facility, integral air ingress tests (NACOK, FZJ), isotopic analysis of fuel irradiated to very high burn-up (170 GWd/tHM) … HTR-TN partners consider that beyond mere electricity generation, the main motivation for developing a new generation of HTRs is their potential for providing high temperature heat for industrial processes. But coupling a nuclear reactor with an industrial process is a very challenging target requiring a large R&D effort. Therefore after developing base technologies for modular HTRs in FP 5 and FP 6, the future objective should be the demonstration of such a coupling by a large scale prototype experiment matching a HTR heat source and an industrial application. In particular during the 7 th Framework Programme (FP 7), the infrastructure necessary for qualifying the components of the prototype should be developed (large test loops, irradiation facilities, etc).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The micro-fluidic {{arrangement for}} detecting chemical, biochemical molecules and/or particles contained in liquid samples, comprises measuring channel (1) for {{the flow of the}} liquid, barrier elements (2) arranged on the measuring channel, and <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> The barrier <b>elements</b> change the direction of flow of a part of the liquid sample, so that a part of the liquid sample does not flow parallelly to the longitudinal axis of the measuring channel. On bottom of the measuring channel a catcher molecules and/or catcher substances are immobilized in stripes shaped manner. The barrier elements are arranged in an interval in an angle of 1 - 90 degrees in reference to the longitudinal axis of the measuring channel and are not led across the entire width of the measuring channel. Between the barrier elements and the bottom of the measuring channel, a free gap, by which a part of the liquid sample flows, is trained. <b>A</b> <b>heated</b> liquid is led through the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> The <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is formed with a Peltier element or controllable heating element. The measuring channel is sealed by a vacuum seal. The detection takes place optically and mass sensitively. Surface plasmones are stimulated during the detection. The arrangement keeps a constant internal pressure. The barrier elements alternately coming from the side edge of the measuring channel, are built and a front side end of barrier elements is arranged at the opposite side edge in a distance, so that a part of the liquid sample flows through the measuring channel with constantly changing direction of flow or flows through a meander shaped manner. USE - For detecting chemical, biochemical molecules and/or particles contained in liquid samples (claimed) such a rinsing liquid or buffer solution. ADVANTAGE - The arrangement achieves a high binding rate of analytes according to preimmobilized specific captures, thus avoiding measurement error and increasing sensitivity and safety of the analysis. This arrangement requires small volume of liquid samples, thus leading reduction of costs...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} a simple methodology for cost estimation of <b>a</b> near optimal <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> network, which comprises mixed materials of construction. In traditional pinch technology and mathematical programming {{it is usually}} assumed that all <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> in <b>a</b> network obey a single cost model. This implies that all <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> in <b>a</b> network are of the same type and use the same materials of construction (an assumption that is unwarranted). The method introduced in this article enables the designer to decomposes {{the total cost of}} <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> into two <b>elements,</b> namely cost of the tubes and cost of the shell, thereby predict a more reliable cost for the network. By subsequent use of the binary variables and evaluation of the physical conditions of the streams, one can assign the streams to pass either through shell or tubes. Whereby, shell and tubes can be of different materials and therefore different cost models can be applied. Another advantage of the approach is that the pressure drop in each side of the exchanger (shell or tubes) can be assessed leading to more accurate evaluation of corresponding heat transfer coefficient for each individual stream. Finally an objective function (total cost) can be defined based on mixed materials of construction and different values of heat transfer coefficients. The proposed mode...|$|R
