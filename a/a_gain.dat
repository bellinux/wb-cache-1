In his first game as a college halfback, Chappuis completed seven of eighteen passes for <b>a</b> <b>gain</b> of 80yards, and also rushed for 49yards in a 9–0 win over the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. Chappuis' predecessor as Michigan's halfback, Heisman Trophy winner Tom Harmon, completed seven passes in a single game only three times in three years, a feat accomplished by Chappuis in his first game.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of his success in leading the Hokies to a bowl game win, Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick was named {{the most valuable player}} of the winning team. Vick finished the game having completed 10 of 18 passes for 205 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Vick also ran the ball nine times for <b>a</b> <b>gain</b> of 21 yards and a touchdown.

5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was downed in the {{end zone}} for a touchback. Texas' offense thus began its drive at its 20-yard line. The first play of the drive was an end-around that gained 10yards and a first down for Texas. After an {{incomplete}} pass, Mitchell gained five yards on a counter run. On third down, Williams caught a six-yard pass for a first down at the Texas 41-yard line. Mitchell ran six yards on first down, but was stopped after <b>a</b> <b>gain</b> of just one yard on second down. The second-down play caused the final seconds to tick off the clock in the third quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech leading, 1410.|$|E
5|$|After {{kicking off}} {{to start the}} game, Arizona got the ball first in the second half. Their first drive went three-and-out. After a 51-yard punt, Nevada took over at their own 11-yard line. They put {{together}} an 11-play, 89-yard drive that culminated with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Cody Fajardo to Richy Turner. During the course of throwing the touchdown pass, Fajardo hurt his hand and was seen shaking it {{on his way to}} the end zone to celebrate the score. He returned for Nevada's next offensive drive. Arizona's next drive got them into Nevada territory, but an interception thrown by Matt Scott ended any hopes of scoring. Nevada took the field and drove 84 yards down the field on 15 plays. Near the end of the drive once Nevada was inside the 10-yard line, Fajardo ran the ball for <b>a</b> <b>gain</b> of three yards. During the course of the play, he took a hit to the head from an Arizona defender. He exited the game for one play, but subsequently returned on that drive and scored a one-yard rushing touchdown. Arizona was held scoreless in the quarter, and heading into the final quarter of regulation, Nevada possessed a 45-28 lead.|$|E

5|$|HTT is {{expressed}} in all mammalian cells. The highest concentrations {{are found in the}} brain and testes, with moderate amounts in the liver, heart, and lungs. The function of HTT in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, cell signaling, and intracellular transporting. In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found. In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. Caspase, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an anti-apoptotic agent preventing programmed cell death and controls the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis. HTT also facilitates vesicular transport and synaptic transmission and controls neuronal gene transcription. If the expression of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, brain cell survival is improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT. In humans the disruption of the normal gene does not cause the disease. It is thought that the disease is not caused by inadequate production of HTT, but by <b>a</b> <b>gain</b> of toxic function of mHTT.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Dugan {{developed}} <b>a</b> <b>gain</b> limiting improvement to the automixing algorithm. The Dugan Gain Limiting System was patented in September 1989 and {{presented to the}} 87th AES convention in October. Dugan described for the AES his prototype of an automixer to be inserted into selected microphone channels of a mixing console, operated by a person, to help in mixing multiple live microphones to have less reverberation and noise, more focus on the desired sound, eliminating the mixing engineer's problem of too-slow human reaction time. The gain limiting system provided smooth, continuous control over the equivalent number of open microphones (NOM) that the automixer would send at its outputs. The NOM could be set anywhere between 1 and 10, with higher settings sounding more natural for a recording in a studio, and lower settings offering greater control of acoustic feedback {{in the presence of}} sound reinforcement loudspeakers. An embodiment of Dugan's three patents was produced as the Model D Automatic Mixing Controller, a 3U rack unit handling 8 channels which could be linked with up to 11 other Model Ds to automatically mix as many as 96 channels simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Maryland {{advanced}} to the Oklahoma 20-yard line, and Tatum elected for a field goal attempt. Now against the wind, the kick failed, with the ball going wide right. The Sooners took over on downs and halfback Jack Ging completed a pass to end Max Boydston for a five-yard gain. Ging then rushed for threeyards. On the next play, Calame pitched to Grigg who ran {{to the left and}} picked up 12yards for a first down. Calame then completed a pass to back Bob Burris for sixyards. Grigg faked a pass and ran to the right for <b>a</b> <b>gain</b> of 12yards and a first down on the Maryland 39-yard line. The Terrapins stopped two Sooner rushing attempts before Calame connected with Burris again for an 11-yard gain. Burris then rushed for threemore yards to advance to the Maryland 25. Tatum called a time-out. On third down with oneyard to go, Calame faked a handoff to Ging and executed an option run to the left. He pitched to Grigg and threw a block. Grigg was tackled at the goal-line but managed to extend his body into the endzone. Buddy Leake made the extra point. Shortly before halftime, Calame suffered a separated collarbone. With back-up Pat O'Neal also injured, only third-string quarterback Jack Van Pool remained, and he had little game experience.|$|E

5|$|North Carolina's post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Virginia Tech 25-yard line, and the Hokies prepared for their second possession of the game. Parker was stopped for no gain on a run attempt, and another attempt on the next play was stopped for a loss of a yard. Facing third down, Clark attempted to scramble for the first down, but was stopped after <b>a</b> <b>gain</b> of six yards. Having gone three and out, the Hokies punted again. The kick was downed at the 36-yard line, and North Carolina's offense returned for its second possession of the game. On the first play of the drive, Linton gained two yards on a run up {{the middle of the}} field. On the next play, Keldorf completed a 62-yard pass to Octavus Barnes, who had broken free of the Virginia Tech defense. Barnes sprinted into the end zone for a touchdown, and after the extra point kick, North Carolina led 100 with 6:07 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to the missed field goal, Alabama {{began its}} drive at its 25-yard line—the line of {{scrimmage}} for the field goal. In the drive's first play, Zow completed a seven-yard pass to wide receiver Calvin Hall. Alexander then ran {{to the left side}} for a two-yard gain. On third down, Alexander gained three yards and a first down. After that, Moore sacked Zow for a two-yard loss, to the 35-yard line. After the sack, Zow was hit again by the Virginia Tech defense and fumbled the ball. The fumble was scooped up by an Alabama player, however, and resulted in <b>a</b> <b>gain</b> of four yards. Zow then completed a pass to Alexander at the 50-yard line for a first down. Once there, Alabama was twice penalized five yards for false starts on consecutive plays. The penalties ran out the final seconds of the first quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech leading, 70.|$|E
5|$|The Hokie kickoff {{rolled into}} the end zone for a touchback, and North Carolina started its second drive of the half from its 20-yard line. The first play of the drive was a three-yard run, and it was {{followed}} by a six-yard pass from Keldorf to Linton. Needing a single yard for a first down, the Tar Heels rushed straight ahead and gained two yards and the first down at the 31-yard line. North Carolina continued to move the ball efficiently: Linton gained two yards on a rushing play, then Keldorf threw a short pass to Linton that gained 37 yards after Linton broke free of the Virginia Tech defense. The play resulted in a first down at the Virginia Tech 31-yard line. There, however, Keldorf was sacked for a three-yard loss. After the sack, Keldorf completed a 21-yard pass to Crumpler for a first down at the 13-yard line. Keldorf then attempted to scramble for <b>a</b> <b>gain,</b> but was stopped for no gain. That play was the final one of the quarter, which ended with North Carolina still in possession of a firm lead, 283.|$|E

Oxendine was tackled after <b>a</b> <b>gain</b> of two yards, then Tech was penalized five yards for an illegal shift. After being pushed back to the 30-yard line, Druckenmiller completed a 28-yard pass to Still, who picked up a first down at the Texas two-yard line. On the next play, Parker rushed through the Texas defense for the Hokies' first offensive touchdown of the game. The extra point kick was good, and with 2:32 remaining in the third quarter, Virginia Tech took its first lead of the game.|$|E
5|$|The kick was downed by Virginia Tech at the State 22-yard {{line with}} 5:22 {{remaining}} in the game. On the first play of the drive, Jones gained 13 yards and a first down at the 45-yard line of Florida State. This {{was followed by a}} 22-yard run and a first down by Jones at the Tech 33-yard line. Three more runs by Jones gained another nine yards, but rather than attempt a field goal, Bowden ordered his offense to attempt to convert the first down. A quarterback sneak resulted in just enough of <b>a</b> <b>gain</b> for a first down, and State's drive continued. On the first play after the conversion, Rix completed a 23-yard pass to Walker for a touchdown. The score and subsequent extra point gave State a 3017 lead with 2:14 {{remaining in the}} game.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Alabama 27-yard line. On Alabama's first play of the game, Crimson Tide quarterback Andrew Zow was sacked by Virginia Tech defender Corey Moore for a loss of seven yards. Running back Shaun Alexander regained five of those lost yards on the next play, then Zow was again sacked by the Tech defense. Alabama thus went three and out to begin the game and prepared for the game's first punt. During the kick, Virginia Tech defender Keion Carpenter broke through the offensive line of Alabama and blocked the punt. Thanks to the blocked punt, the Virginia Tech offense started at the Alabama 14-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Stith ran the ball straight ahead for <b>a</b> <b>gain</b> of one yard. Clark then attempted a pass into the end zone, but the ball was intercepted by Alabama defender Fernando Bryant.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{second drive}} {{of the game}} started at its 28-yard line after the penalty.

Two running plays after the long play gained little yardage, then Tech appeared to gain a touchdown on a passing play from Noel to wide receiver Ernst Wilford. During the play, however, a Tech offensive lineman committed a holding penalty that negated the score. After a 10-yard penalty, Noel fumbled the ball. The loose ball was recovered by Florida State at the State 45-yard line, and Tech was denied a chance to score.|$|E
5|$|Scott tallied {{the go-ahead}} {{touchdown}} to complete Maryland's comeback, 20–17. The following week, Maryland fell to a heavy underdog again when a reeling Virginia team engineered a 31–0 shutout. Scott, then the leading rusher in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), had 11carries but {{was held to}} just 36yards. Despite the setback, Scott retained {{the lead in the}} ACC with 96.4rushing yards per game. After a bye week, Maryland shutout 21st-ranked Wake Forest, 26–0. Scott had 18carries for a game-high of 73yards, threw a nine-yard touchdown pass, and had three fumbles. In the first quarter, Scott fumbled at the Wake Forest 25-yard line, but was able to recover the ball. Two plays later, he executed a halfback option, where he took the handoff and threw a nine-yard pass to Heyward-Bey for a touchdown. It was Scott's first pass attempt and completion. Scott fumbled twice more in the first half, and Wake Forest recovered only to miss a field goal attempt each time. Against NC State, Scott had 23carries for 163yards and a 24-yard touchdown. In the fourth quarter, after the third play of Maryland's game-winning drive, Meggett replaced Scott, who had re-injured his shoulder. With the sixth win, Maryland attained bowl eligibility. Scott remained the ACC leading rusher with 102.6yards per game. He was deemed questionable before the Virginia Tech game, but did see action. However, the Virginia Tech line held Scott to 11yards on 10carries, although he did manage five receptions for 57yards. Against 17th-ranked North Carolina, Scott recorded 129rushing yards and a three-yard touchdown run. Maryland entered its penultimate regular season game against Florida State still within reach of the Atlantic Division title, and with it, a berth in the ACC Championship Game. Florida State, however, dashed Maryland's title hopes in a 37–3 rout in which Scott recorded 82rushing yards, but fumbled twice. In the fourth quarter, defensive end Everette Brown forced Scott to fumble, which was seen as the end to any potential comeback. Against a tough Boston College line, the Maryland rushing attack faltered, which forced quarterback Chris Turner to resort mostly to the pass. Scott rushed 13times for <b>a</b> <b>gain</b> of just 19yards.|$|E
