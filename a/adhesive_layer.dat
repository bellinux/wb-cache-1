60|$|The tips of both branches, {{when they}} {{come into contact with}} a stick, grasp it like any {{ordinary}} tendril. But {{in the course of a}} few days, the lower surface swells and becomes developed into a cellular layer, which adapts itself closely to the wood, and firmly adheres to it. This layer is analogous to the adhesive discs formed by the extremities of the tendrils of some species of Bignonia and of Ampelopsis; but in the Hanburya the layer is developed along the terminal inner surface, sometimes for a length of 1.75 inches, and not at the extreme tip. The layer is white, whilst the tendril is green, and near the tip it is sometimes thicker than the tendril itself; it generally spreads a little beyond the sides of the tendril, and is fringed with free elongated cells, which have enlarged globular or retort-shaped heads. This cellular layer apparently secretes some resinous cement; for its adhesion to the wood was not lessened by an immersion of 24 hrs. in alcohol or water, but was quite loosened by a similar immersion in ether or turpentine. After a tendril has once firmly coiled itself round a stick, it is difficult to imagine of what use the adhesive cellular layer can be. Owing to the spiral contraction which soon ensues, the tendrils were never able to remain, excepting in one instance, in contact with a thick post or a nearly flat surface; if they had quickly become attached by means of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer,</b> this would evidently have been of service to the plant.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a {{durability}} study of the effects of exposing externally-bonded CFRP-concrete beams to three elevated water temperatures (25 °C, 40 °C and 60 °C). The effects of the heated water environments on the <b>adhesive</b> bonding <b>layer</b> between the CFRP and concrete beams were evaluated by quantifying: (1) the changes of delaminations within the <b>adhesive</b> bonding <b>layer,</b> (2) the changes in resistance to direct shear force and (3) the changes of failure mode distribution. Before the exposure, the condition of the <b>adhesive</b> bonding <b>layer</b> was inspected by infrared thermography (IRT). After exposure, the deterioration of the same bonding layer and failure mode distributions were measured by analyzing the visual photos on the failed CFRP strips. The failure modes were found to be affected largely by the combined effect of elevated temperature and moisture ingress, in which three types were identified: failure at concrete beams, at <b>adhesive</b> bonding <b>layer</b> and interface between CFRP strip and concrete. With these methods, results of 54 specimens show that the <b>adhesive</b> bonding <b>layers</b> of all the specimens had gradually deteriorated in the 40 °C and 60 °C water baths. This deterioration was due to the weakening of the <b>adhesive</b> bonding <b>layers</b> when the glass transition temperature (T g) or the heat distortion temperature (HDT) was approached or even exceeded, and gradual development of delaminations at <b>adhesive</b> bonding <b>layer.</b> Department of Civil and Environmental EngineeringDepartment of Building and Real Estat...|$|R

Asymmetric double butt strap specimens of glass and polycarbonate were manufactured using photobond 53517 adhesive. These were tested at room temperature in laboratory air in zwick Z 10 universal testing machines. Specimens were tensile tested at different strain rates and subjected to creep and low cycle fatigue tests with different hold times.

40|$|Water {{entrapment}} {{occurs at}} resin-dentin interfaces of one-step self-etch adhesives. We hypothesized that by preventing water fluxes from dentin, any water entrapment would {{be attributed to}} incomplete removal of adhesive solvents. We tested this hypothesis by bonding to transparent carious dentin containing occluded dentinal tubules. An experimental single-bottle, one-step self-etch adhesive was applied to flat surfaces of caries-affected dentin surrounded by sound dentin, with or without pulpal pressure. Resin-dentin interfaces were examined with TEM after silver-impregnation. Although caries-affected dentin was highly porous, <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers</b> were devoid of silver deposits when tubules were occluded. Conversely, variable extents of water-treeing and water-droplets were identified from <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers</b> in bonded sound dentin. Water-treeing and water-droplet formation, being manifestations of evaporative and convective water fluxes, can be eliminated during bonding to occluded transparent carious dentin. However, the highly porous nature of this clinically relevant substrate after bonding may lead to potentially undesirable consequences. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Synopsis: The {{modeling}} {{and analysis of}} un-reinforced masonry walls strengthened with externally bonded unidirectional composite laminates and subjected to out-of-plane loading is investigated. The model is based on variational principles, static equilibrium, and compatibility between the structural components, which include the masonry units (blocks), the mortar joints, the FRP strips, and the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers.</b> The modeling of the masonry block and the mortar joints follows the small displacements and the Bernoulli-Euler beam theories. The strengthening FRP strips are modeled following the lamination theory and the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers</b> are modeled as two dimensional linear elastic continuum. The effects of cracking of the mortar joints and the debonding of the composite laminates near the mortar joints are also considered. A numerical example is presented.

50|$|Electronic {{components}} are first positioned onto an <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> of a temporary or permanent substrate {{according to the}} customers needs and design parameters.

The <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> is then cut (after removing the temporary substrate if it exists) or drilled out over the component leads mechanically or by laser ablation.

If needed, other encapsulation layers of components or vias can be placed {{on top of each other}} to make multi-level circuit connections. This construction is then coated with copper where needed to provide traces. Thus, this finished circuit board can now receive a conformal coating to protect against the environment, and then be placed into an assembly housing or be sent to another section for mechanical and/or electrical connections with other PCBs.|$|E
