5|$|The main use {{of uranium}} in the {{civilian}} sector is to fuel nuclear power plants. One kilogram of uranium-235 can theoretically produce about 20terajoules of energy (2joules), assuming complete fission; <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> as 1500 tonnes of coal.|$|E
5|$|The exact mass-luminosity {{relationship}} {{depends on}} how efficiently energy can be transported from the core to the surface. A higher opacity has an insulating effect that retains more energy at the core, so the star {{does not need to}} produce <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> to remain in hydrostatic equilibrium. By contrast, a lower opacity means energy escapes more rapidly and the star must burn more fuel to remain in equilibrium. Note, however, that a sufficiently high opacity can result in energy transport via convection, which changes the conditions needed to remain in equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|The {{sources of}} most GRBs are billions of {{light years away}} from Earth, {{implying}} that the explosions are both extremely energetic (a typical burst releases <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> {{in a few seconds}} as the Sun will in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime) and extremely rare (a few per galaxy per million years). All observed GRBs have originated from outside the Milky Way galaxy, although a related class of phenomena, soft gamma repeater flares, are associated with magnetars within the Milky Way. It has been hypothesized that a gamma-ray burst in the Milky Way, pointing directly towards the Earth, could cause a mass extinction event.|$|E
25|$|A {{saturated}} liquid contains <b>as</b> <b>much</b> thermal <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> it can without boiling (or conversely a saturated vapor contains as little thermal energy {{as it can}} without condensing).|$|R
50|$|The {{range that}} powered flight {{articles}} can achieve is ultimately limited by their drag, as well <b>as</b> how <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> they can store {{on board and}} how efficiently they can turn that energy into propulsion.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{function}} of pigments in plants is photosynthesis, which uses the green pigment chlorophyll {{along with several}} red and yellow pigments that help to capture <b>as</b> <b>much</b> light <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> possible.|$|R
5|$|From the first, {{research}} into the Super was directed by Teller, who was its most enthusiastic proponent. Although this work was always considered secondary to the objective of developing a fission bomb, the prospect of creating more powerful bombs was sufficient to keep it going. The Berkeley summer conference had convinced Teller that the Super was technologically feasible. An important contribution was made by Emil Konopinski, who suggested that deuterium could more easily be ignited if it was mixed with tritium. Bethe noted that a tritium-deuterium (T-D) reaction releases five times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> as a deuterium-deuterium (D-D) reaction. This was not immediately followed up, because tritium was hard to obtain, and there were hopes that deuterium could be easily ignited by a fission bomb, but the cross sections of T-D and D-D were measured by Manley's group in Chicago and Holloway's at Purdue.|$|E
5|$|Herschel wedges, {{also called}} Solar Diagonals, are {{effective}} and inexpensive for small telescopes. The sunlight that is {{destined for the}} eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface {{of a piece of}} glass. Only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected. The rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is reflected, making the device fail-safe. Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> as using the naked eye, possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.|$|E
25|$|A {{rigorous}} {{treatment of}} OTEC reveals that a 20°C temperature difference will provide <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> as a hydroelectric plant with 34m {{head for the}} same volume of water flow.|$|E
50|$|Acoustic {{absorption}} is {{of particular}} interest in soundproofing. Soundproofing aims to absorb <b>as</b> <b>much</b> sound <b>energy</b> (often in particular frequencies) as possible converting it into heat or transmitting it away from a certain location.|$|R
50|$|Kites can {{be flown}} {{high above the}} ship, taking {{advantage}} of stronger, steadier winds. For example, a kite flying on a 200 m line will have twice <b>as</b> <b>much</b> wind <b>energy</b> available {{to it as a}} kite on a 10 m line.|$|R
30|$|Based on Equation  4, the DOD for the ‘Trojan L 16 P’ {{battery is}} 70 %, {{which means that}} the battery has {{delivered}} 70 % of its energy and has 30 % of its energy reserved. DOD can always be treated <b>as</b> how <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> the battery delivered.|$|R
25|$|Since {{there are}} two wing strokes (the {{upstroke}} and downstroke) in each cycle of the wing movement, the kinetic energy is 2×43=86erg. This is about <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> as is consumed in hovering itself.|$|E
25|$|Every {{five years}} a year-long slow quake occurs beneath Wellington, {{stretching}} from Kapiti to the Marlborough Sounds. It was first measured in 2003, and reappeared in 2008 and 2013. It releases <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> as a magnitude 7 quake, {{but as it}} happens slowly there is no damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{achievements}} of SpaceShipOne are more {{comparable to the}} X-15 than orbiting spacecraft like the Space Shuttle. Accelerating a spacecraft to orbital speed requires more than 60 times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> as accelerating it to Mach 3. It would also require an elaborate heat shield to safely dissipate that energy during re-entry.|$|E
2500|$|The Mini E's {{regenerative}} braking {{was designed to}} capture <b>as</b> <b>much</b> kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> possible giving it a distinct driving characteristic. [...] When the driver released the acceleration pedal, the Mini E started braking, slowing it down significantly as if the brake pedal were pressed.|$|R
50|$|It {{is equally}} {{important}} to charge the batteries <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible in periods of daylight when the car is not racing. To capture <b>as</b> <b>much</b> solar <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> possible, the solar panels are generally directed such that these are perpendicular to the incident sun rays. Sometimes the whole solar array is tilted for this purpose.|$|R
2500|$|The primary {{function}} of pigments in plants is photosynthesis, which uses the green pigment chlorophyll {{along with several}} red and yellow pigments that help to capture <b>as</b> <b>much</b> light <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> possible. [...] Pigments are also {{an important factor in}} attracting insects to flowers to encourage pollination.|$|R
25|$|Since {{opening a}} window {{was not an}} option, the {{structure}} also required huge air conditioners to control the temperature and avoid killing the plants within. For every unit of solar energy that entered the structure, the air conditioners would expend approximately three times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> to cool the habitat back down.|$|E
25|$|All proto- and mid-life stars radiate {{enormous}} amounts of energy generated by fusion processes. Mass for mass, the deuterium–tritium fusion process releases roughly three times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> as uranium-235 fission, and millions of times more energy than a chemical reaction such as the burning of coal. It {{is the goal of}} a fusion power station to harness this energy to produce electricity.|$|E
25|$|Extra {{energetic}} photons: Photons travelling through galaxy clusters should gain {{energy and}} then lose it {{again on the}} way out. The accelerating expansion of the Universe should stop the photons returning all the energy, but even taking this into account photons from {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation gain twice <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> as expected. This may indicate that gravity falls off faster than inverse-squared at certain distance scales.|$|E
30|$|Our {{comparison}} of the average energy spectra during average solar wind conditions and during CIR events indicates that the average ion energy is not strongly affected by the CIR. This means {{that the increase in}} available energy is relatively effective in removing ions, <b>as</b> not <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> is wasted in further acceleration of ions that would anyway escape.|$|R
25|$|Since the {{kinetic energy}} {{increases}} with {{the square of}} the speed, an object doubling its speed has four times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> kinetic <b>energy.</b> For example, a car traveling twice as fast as another requires four times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> distance to stop, assuming a constant braking force. As a consequence of this quadrupling, it takes four times the work to double the speed.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{accelerate}} the vehicle to 69 mph, DUSC 2015 relies upon an in-house designed in-wheel motor. A new brushless DC motor was manufactured. 16 inches in diameter and theoretical efficiency in excess of 90%, the new in-hub motor design ensures <b>as</b> <b>much</b> solar <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> possible is converted into mechanical energy.|$|R
25|$|The building's design {{incorporates}} {{goals for}} earning a LEED Platinum and a Net-Zero rating, {{meaning that it}} will generate <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> as it consumes. The Moore School was selected by the U.S. Energy Department to partner with its national laboratories in its Net-Zero Energy Commercial Building Partnership program. As {{a result of the}} partnership, the Moore School has benefitted from expertise in energy technologies and building systems and design and operating practices.|$|E
25|$|The VLT has {{observed}} the afterglow of the farthest known gamma-ray burst. With a measured redshift of 8.2, {{the light from}} this very remote astronomical source has taken more than 13billion years to reach the earth. It occurred {{when the universe was}} less than 600million years old (less than five percent of its present age), and released 300 times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> in a few seconds as the sun will in its entire lifetime (more than 10billion years).|$|E
25|$|Reactor efficiency. Conventional {{reactors}} consume {{less than}} one percent of the mined uranium, leaving the rest as waste. With perfectly working reprocessing LFTR may consume up to about 99% of its thorium fuel. The improved fuel efficiency means that 1 ton of natural thorium in a LFTR produces <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> as 35 t of enriched uranium in conventional reactors (requiring 250 t of natural uranium), or 4,166,000 tons of black coal in a coal power plant.|$|E
2500|$|Metro Vancouver {{operates}} and maintains the liquid waste facility, which includes managing [...] "the network of trunk sewers, pumping stations and {{wastewater treatment plants}} that connect with municipal sewer systems". Throughout operations, the organization is committed to protecting {{public health and the}} environment, and recovering <b>as</b> <b>much</b> resources (<b>energy,</b> nutrients, etc.) as possible out of the waste stream.|$|R
40|$|Low voltage {{photovoltaic}} systems require high efficient converters to deliver <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible <b>energy</b> to the load with high gain DC voltage conversion. This paper present efficient step-up DC/DC converter {{composed of two}} identical phases driven interchangeably. Simulation of theoretical assumption and discussion on power losses has been carried out. The use of silicon carbide components and current sharing technique assures efficiency within wide power range. Index Terms: PV-Photovoltaic, L-Inductor, D-Diode...|$|R
50|$|However, {{the total}} energy for a mission depends on total {{propellant}} use, as well <b>as</b> how <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> is needed {{per unit of}} propellant. For low exhaust velocity {{with respect to the}} mission delta-v, enormous amounts of reaction mass is needed. In fact a very low exhaust velocity is not energy efficient at all for this reason; {{but it turns out that}} neither are very high exhaust velocities.|$|R
25|$|Through a {{laboratory}} experiment, {{it was discovered}} that the quality of the food Vespula vulgaris consumes directly affects its body temperature. The higher the quality of the prey, measured by the amount of sucrose present in the food, the higher thorax temperature it had. Such high thorax temperature indicates the wasp's excitement and motivation to collect the offered food. The wasps will want to absorb <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> as possible because the output of the energy directly coordinates to the power of flight muscles. Higher thorax temperature therefore means more power in thoracic flight muscles, leading to faster movement and in overall, more foraging.|$|E
25|$|In 1973 Kelly began {{regularly}} making large-scale outdoor sculpture. Kelly gave up painted surfaces, instead choosing unvarnished steel, aluminum or bronze, {{often in}} totem-like configurations such as Curve XXIII (1981). While the totemic forms of his freestanding sculptures can {{measure up to}} 15 feet tall, his wall reliefs can span more than 14 feet wide. Kelly’s sculpture “is founded on its adherence to absolute simplicity and clarity of form.” For his 1980s sculptures, {{during this period of}} his time in Spencertown, the artist devoted for the first time <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> to his sculptures as to his painting, and in the process producing over sixty percent of his total 140 sculptures.|$|E
25|$|Clades B and C {{are found}} more {{frequently}} in the deeper water regions, which may explain the higher susceptibility to increased temperatures. Terrestrial plants that receive less sunlight because they {{are found in the}} undergrowth can be analogized to clades B, C, and D. Since clades B through D are found at deeper depths, they require an elevated light absorption rate to be able to synthesize <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy.</b> With elevated absorption rates at UV wavelengths, the deeper occurring phylotypes are more prone to coral bleaching versus the more shallow clades. Clade D has been observed to be high temperature-tolerant, and as a result it has a higher rate of survival than clades B and C.|$|E
5|$|Corn (USA), or maize (British English), is {{the second}} most {{palatable}} grain. It provides twice <b>as</b> <b>much</b> digestible <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber. Because of these characteristics, it is easy to over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy corn is poisonous if fed to horses.|$|R
50|$|D-T (deuterium-tritium) fusion is {{the fusion}} {{reaction}} {{that produces the}} most energetic neutrons, with 14.1 MeV of kinetic energy and traveling at 17% {{of the speed of}} light. D-T fusion is also the easiest fusion reaction to ignite, reaching near-peak rates even when the deuterium and tritium nuclei have only a thousandth <b>as</b> <b>much</b> kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> the 14.1 MeV that will be produced.|$|R
