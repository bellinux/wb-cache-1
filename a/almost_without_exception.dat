40|$|This {{article is}} devoted {{to the study of the}} ideological {{attitude}} of the courts and élites of the peripheral, independent kingdoms when faced with the political problems of the dominance of the Assyrian empire and of its unrestrained imperialistic expansionism. The article is aimed at contrasting and modifying a theory largely prevailing among the historians of the Ancient Near East and especially of the Biblical world. According to it, the élites of the peripheral countries subject to the ideological, political and military pressure by the Assyrian empire would have adopted, <b>almost</b> <b>without</b> <b>exceptions,</b> a rigidly uniform and constant hostility and would have brought about an obstinate resistance against acculturation, political enslavement and territorial incorporation. This theory is now disproved when considering a recently discovered text, a short Luwian royal inscription by Warikas, king of Hiyawa / Adaniya (a Ist millennium state extending in Classical Cilicia, south-eastern Anatolia). In this inscription, the Cilician king boasts with utmost proud that the Assyrian king (most probably Tiglath-pileser III, 742 - 725 BCE) has become his own "father and mother" and that his own dynasty and the Assyrian dynasty have been fused into "a single house". In other words, a peripheral king subject to a heavy pressure like that exerted by Tiglath-pileser III (who smashed and annexed many Syrian kingdoms) is proud to officially celebrate his alliance with Assyria and his familial link with the Assyrian dynasty - exactly the contrary of the commonly shared opinion. A parallel is traced between Warikas' text and the inscriptions by Bar-rakib, king of Sam'al (a northern Syrian kingdom west of Hiyawa/Cilicia), who also boasts to have been, like his father, an ally of the Assyrian king...|$|R
500|$|There are differing {{accounts}} {{as to how}} Caligari {{was first}} received by audiences and critics immediately after its release. Stephen Brockmann, Anton Kaes and film theorist Kristin Thompson say it was popular with both {{the general public and}} well-respected by critics. Robinson wrote, [...] "The German critics, <b>almost</b> <b>without</b> <b>exception,</b> ranged from favourable to ecstatic". Kracauer said critics were [...] "unanimous in praising Caligari as the first work of art on the screen", but also said it was [...] "too high-brow to become popular in Germany". Barlow said it was often the subject of critical disapproval, which he believes is because early film reviewers attempted to assign fixed definitions to the young art of cinema, and thus had trouble accepting the bizarre and unusual elements of Caligari. Some critics felt it imitated a stage production too closely. Other commentators, like critic Herbert Jhering and novelist Blaise Cendrars, objected to the presentation of the story as a madman's delusion because they felt it belittled Expressionism as an artform. Theatre critic Helmut Grosse condemned the film's visual design as clichéd and derivative, calling it a [...] "cartoon and (a) reproduction of designs rather than from what actually took place on stage". Several reviewers, like Kurt Tucholsky and Blaise Cendrars, criticized the use of real actors in front of artificially-painted sets, saying it created an inconsistent level of stylization. Critic Herbert Ihering echoed this point in a 1920 review: [...] "If actors are acting without energy and are playing within landscapes and rooms which are formally 'excessive', the continuity of the principle is missing".|$|E
500|$|Part of {{the legacy}} {{associated}} with the fu is its use {{as a form of}} sociopolitical protest, such as the theme of the loyal minister who has been unjustly exiled by the ruler or those in power at the court, rather than receiving the promotion and respect which he truly deserves. In the Verses of Chu, one of the works attributed to Qu Yuan is the [...] "Li Sao", {{which is one of the}} earliest known works in this tradition, both as ancestral to the fu as well as its incorporation of political criticism as a theme of poetry. [...] The theme of unjust exile is related to the development of Xiaoxiang poetry, or the [...] poetry stylistically or thematically based upon lamenting the unjust exile of the poet, either directly, or allegorically through the use of the persona of a friend or historical figure (a safer course in the case of a poet-official who might be punished for any too blatant criticism of the current emperor). During the Han Dynasty, along with the development of the fu stylistically, the idea that it incorporate political criticism through indirection and allegory also developed. Han Dynasty historian and author Ban Gu in his Book of Han pointedly refers to a fu by Qu Yuan as a literary example of the use of the theme of the loyal minister who has been unjustly exiled, rather than receiving the promotion and respect which he truly deserves. As Hellmut Wilhelm puts it: [...] "...the Han fu can easily be classified into a limited number of types. All types have one feature in common: <b>almost</b> <b>without</b> <b>exception</b> they can be and have been interpreted as voicing criticism—either of the ruler, the ruler's behavior, or certain political acts or plans of the ruler; or of the court officials or the ruler's favorites; or, generally, of the lack of discrimination in the employment of officials. The few examples that are positive in tone recommend the authors or their peers for employment, or even contain specific political suggestions. In short, almost all fu have a political purport, and, in addition, almost all of them deal with the relationship between the ruler and his officials." [...] Seen in context, Ban Gu's discussion of Qu Yuan and the Chu sao style is less to the point of the actual evolutionary path of the fu and more to the point that the main purpose of the fu is political and social criticism through poetic indirection: thus, in fu, paradoxically, the [...] "fantastic descriptions and an overflowing rhetoric...can be reduced to...restraint", as the sociopolitical criticism which was key to the fu was constrained within a very subtle, elaborately indirect, occasional, and allusive mode.|$|E

As it is well-known, the right wing FIDESZ government, which came to power with a 2 / 3 supermajority in Parliament, has embarked upon a totally new economic policy as from mid- 2010. Within this setting, illiberal constitutional changes and unortodox economic policies were implemented. Renationalization was a significant (but not the most important) building block of this. As we analysed the individual transactions, {{it turned out that}} actually many of them were initiated by the previous, Socialist led government. In other words, there are interesting elements of continuity here, especially in the energy sector. Another interesting finding is, that <b>almost</b> <b>without</b> <b>exceptions,</b> the renationalization deals were not implemented by force, the Hungarian state paid quite generously to the sellers. In the case of the largest deals, there is even reason to speak of sweetheart deals through which the Hungarian government tried to make favour to German and US businesses. So far, the renationalization affected more than 200 firms (including banks) for which some HUF 1600 bn (2 ̆ 248 5 bn 2 ̆ 0 ac) state money was used. This figure, just as the sums involved in the individual transactions are somewhat misleading, if compared to the privatization revenues generated by previous governments prior to 2010. However, if all transactions 2 ̆ 013 i. e. asset sales and asset purchases 2 ̆ 013 are expressed as a percentage of Hungary 2 ̆ 019 s annual GDP, it becomes clear that the post 2010 nationalization deals were much smaller than the 1990 - 2000 privatization deals...|$|R

However, towards 1980 ’s a new industrial venture namely garments manufacturing factories started to grow with some favorable policy support from the Government and preferential treatment of major apparel importing countries by guaranteed share of their market. Methods: The data collection method is primary survey on employees of garment industry and experts of the same industry supported by secondary research on previous research, industry report, government paper, and interview of resource persons.

While the original strategy for group buying in China was self-organized and executed, most of the group buying in Europe and North America is done only through online intermediaries. Interested buyers are, most often, asked for credit card details, which will be charged only when a required number of buyers register. <b>Almost</b> <b>without</b> an <b>exception,</b> intermediaries charge vendors a percentage fee in the range of up to 50% of the total value of the whole deal. Due to this business model, group buying remains limited to the physical services sector and is not seeing growth as with the original strategy in the People's Republic of China.Nevertheless, intermediaries with fairly identical business models are appearing daily, especially across the United Kingdom and Germany. The most notable characteristic of all those intermediaries is the selected deals orientation towards local markets, bound to cities and towns. Leaders include Groupon (and their United Kingdom's spinoff, MyCityDeal), LivingSocial, Plum district, BuyWithMe (Bought by GILT in winter 2011), and TeamBuy (Canada), with hundreds of copycats in different languages. The Groupon and other group buying sites’ business model is working with local retail stores and restaurants with location-targeted coupons but national chains are also participating.
