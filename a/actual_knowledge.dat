25|$|Apart {{of these}} active {{interventions}} into Nubian affairs, the Mameluks also {{put a lot}} pressure on the Christians inside their borders. The patriarch of Alexandria was forced to cancel the dispatchment of priests to Alwa, which was problematic, since Alodia, like the other Coptic nations of Africa, was dependent upon Egyptian bishops. The consequential deterioration of Christian faith is attested by Portuguese sources from the early 16th century. A traveller and companion of Francisco Álvares, who visited Nubia in around 1500, states that the Nubians considered themselves Christian, but were so lacking in Christian instruction {{that they had no}} <b>actual</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the faith. In 1520, Nubian ambassadors reached Ethiopia and asked the emperor for priests. They claimed that no more priests could reach Nubia because of wars between Muslims, leading to a decline of Christianity in their land.|$|E

25|$|Roads are, {{by their}} nature, used by {{vehicles}} {{and it is}} clearly foreseeable that a person left lying on the road is {{at risk of being}} further injured by an inattentive driver. Hence, if A leaves B on the road with knowledge of that risk and a foreseeable event occurs, A remains the more proximate cause. This leaves whether the test of foresight should be subjective, objective or hybrid (i.e. both subjective and objective). Obviously, there is no difficulty in holding A liable if A had <b>actual</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the likelihood that B would be further injured by a driver. The fault which caused the initial injury is compounded by the omission to move B to a safer place or call for assistance. But let us assume that A never averts the possibility of further injury.

Process of grafting was realized with mixer Brabender at temperature 230 °C, speed was 30 RPM and reaction time 6 minutes. 2, 5 -dimethyl- 2, 5 bis(tert-buthylperoxy) hexane (Luperox 101) was used as iniciator.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the factors, which affect decision-making on regular personal saving behaviour {{in the context}} of an emerging market in Vietnam. Focusing on financial literacy, the paper uses a combined measure of <b>actual</b> financial <b>knowledge</b> and a self-assessment of overall financial knowledge. The sample of the study consists of 240 commercial banks customers selected in 12 branches of four banks in Ho Chi Minh City. The questionnaire covers: (1) actual financial knowledge; (2) self-rating of financial knowledge; (3) financial risk tolerance; and (4) demographic characteristics of the respondents. The results of a logistic regression analysis show that perceived and actual financial literacy have separate effects on regular personal saving. Particularly, <b>actual</b> financial <b>knowledge</b> has a statistically significant positive relationship with regular personal saving with odds ratio higher than 6. 5 times. However, perceived financial knowledge and financial risk tolerance factor are not statistically significant with regular personal saving. Finally, this paper offers evidence that the interaction variable, which is used to combine education level with their major study, has a statistically significant relationship with regular personal saving. © Foundation of International Studies and CSR, 2017...|$|R
