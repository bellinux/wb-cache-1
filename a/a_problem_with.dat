5|$|<b>A</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> early bombsights {{was that}} they could only correct {{for the effects of}} the wind in a simple way and {{required}} the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind from the target, to minimise the complexity of the required calculations. This made it difficult to attack moving targets and allowed anti-aircraft artillery to sight their weapons along the wind line.|$|E
5|$|After {{her parents}} {{divorced}} {{when she was}} approximately four years old, Laurer had three different stepfathers and one stepmother. According to Laurer, her first stepfather threatened suicide at one point, and her biological father, who once accidentally stabbed her mother in the thigh with a bread knife, had <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> alcoholism. From 1973 to 1983, she, her siblings and her mother moved several times.|$|E

He retired as chairman of the board of EDO Corporation in 2002.|$|E
30|$|For <b>a</b> closed <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> {{external}} motivation, {{there is}} Responsive creativity, that being {{one in which}} solutions are required for a specific issue (e.g., a group brainstorming assembled to perform in a given project). For <b>a</b> closed <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> internal motivation, there is the Contributory creativity where there are voluntary contributions to <b>a</b> specific <b>problem</b> (e.g., open innovation). For <b>an</b> open <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> external motivation, there is Expected creativity, which requires solutions to problems that must be discovered (e.g., the process of a Design Thinking consultancy can fit here). Finally, to <b>an</b> open <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> internal motivation, there is Proactive creativity where a voluntary solution is developed to problems {{that had not yet}} been discovered (e.g., an unexpected suggestion that solves <b>an</b> unknown <b>problem).</b>|$|R

5|$|Books are {{sometimes}} attacked by cockroaches, silverfish, book mites, booklice, and various beetles which {{feed on the}} covers, paper, bindings and glue. They leave behind physical damage {{in the form of}} tiny holes as well as staining from their faeces. Book pests include the larder beetle, and the larvae of the black carpet beetle and the drugstore beetle which attack leather-bound books, while the common clothes moth and the brown house moth attack cloth bindings. These attacks are largely <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> historic books, because modern bookbinding materials are less susceptible to this type of damage.|$|E

Finishing work on platform reconstruction, lighting, and landscaping lasted the spring of 2013, culminating in a reopening ceremony in June.|$|E
