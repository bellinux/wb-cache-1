5|$|Clark's ruling drew a {{resolution}} of condemnation from the Kentucky General Assembly. He was summoned {{to appear before the}} legislature, but opted to respond to their charges in writing instead. Incensed, the legislature attempted to removed him from office, but the vote of 5935 fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. In October 1823, Clark's decision was upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals; that decision touched off the Old Court-New Court controversy, wherein the legislature attempted to abolish the Court of Appeals <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a more sympathetic court.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{cast and}} production changes over the years, Last of the Summer Wine {{continued to be}} popular with viewers and was renewed year after year despite reports to the contrary. Rumours circulated {{as early as the}} 1980s that the BBC wanted to end the show <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a new programme aimed at a younger audience. Its popularity made this decision hard to justify, however, since even repeats sometimes received ratings of as many as five million viewers per episode.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, the University of Dayton {{released}} a Master Plan {{which called for}} the renovation and construction of several houses, an extension to Stonemill Road to connect directly to Evanston Avenue, and the enlargement and clean-up of the parking areas in the alleys behind the houses. Despite ongoing rumors, there were no plans to raze the Ghetto <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with more high-density housing and other university buildings, despite the landlocked nature of the campus.|$|E
5|$|Sharp's {{role in the}} Relief Party's plan {{to abolish}} the old court <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a new, more {{favorable}} court is not known. As he was the administration's chief legal counsel, historians believe he was closely involved. He {{is known to have}} issued the order for Old Court clerk Achilles Sneed to turn over his records to New Court clerk Francis P. Blair. By practicing as state attorney general before the New Court to the exclusion of the Old Court, Sharp provided it a measure of legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} the witch Cackletta and her {{assistant}} Fawful (disguised as good-will ambassadors) arriving to steal Princess Peach's voice <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with explosives. After being {{summoned to the}} palace by Toad, Mario and Luigi confront and subdue Bowser, who coincidentally was attempting to kidnap Peach. Bowser decides against doing so, and teams up with Mario and Luigi to take her voice back from Cackletta, who has fled to the Beanbean Kingdom, {{with the intention of}} kidnapping Peach afterward when her voice would not destroy his castle.|$|E

5|$|A second {{attempt to}} gain the {{agreement}} of Militia colonels to the proposed amalgamation was made in late June, and was strongly opposed. All fourteen of the Militia representatives insisted that overseas service should be done by complete Militia battalions, rather than drafts sent to regular battalions. A third meeting, in October, proposed that the Militia join with the Volunteers as the senior element of the Territorial Force; this, too, was rejected. As both possible approaches {{for dealing with the}} Militia had been strongly opposed, the decision was taken to do away with it entirely <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a newly created force, the Special Reserve, which would incorporate those elements of the Militia willing to be transferred.|$|E
5|$|Cal Poly Pomona's {{dominant}} landmark is a futurist-styled administrative facility {{known as}} the CLA Building which was designed by Antoine Predock and opened in 1993. The building’s peculiar shape (standing out by a triangular-shaped “skyroom” atop its eight-story tower) {{has become a symbol}} of the university; in addition, its close location to film studios based in the Hollywood borough of Los Angeles have prompted its inclusion in motion pictures such as Gattaca and Impostor. In 2013, the California State University Board of Trustees voted to demolish the building <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a new academic/faculty complex because of severe seismic risks.|$|E

5|$|In May, {{costs for}} {{construction}} of the station were again increased to $4.1 million. The increased costs were primarily associated with the relocation of fiber optic lines during {{the construction of the}} pedestrian tunnel. To reduce overall costs, village officials asked for architects to remove the tunnel <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with an elevated walkway over the tracks. In October 2004, the village board gave final approval to the revised station plan with a pedestrian bridge. The $3.2 million estimated cost of the station was to be financed through a pair of federal transportation grants in addition to the village borrowing against its tax incremental financing district from the adjacent industrial park.|$|E
5|$|In the 2001 {{parliamentary}} election the party lost the gains {{it had made}} according to opinion polling but maintained its position from the 1997 election, it got 14.6% and 26 members in the parliament. The election result allowed them to unseat the Labour Party government of Jens Stoltenberg <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a three-party coalition led by Christian Democrat Kjell Magne Bondevik. However, the coalition continued to decline to govern together with the Progress Party as they considered the political differences too large. The Progress Party eventually decided to tolerate the coalition, as it promised to invest more in defence, open more private hospitals and open for more competition in the public sector. In 2002 the Progress Party again advanced in the opinion polls {{and for a while}} became the largest party.|$|E
5|$|Norsk Hydro {{announced}} in 1963 a savings plan for its four plants in Norway; Chief Executive Officer Rolf Østbye {{made it clear}} that new technology in the production of ammonia would force the closure of the plant at Rjukan, <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a petroleum-based process at Herøya. The Rjukan situation, as it was named in the press, became a source of conflict between the local community and Norsk Hydro; initially 250 jobs were to be moved to Herøya, but in 1964 Norsk Hydro applied for permission to build a power line from Rjukan to Herøya—what would become the death sentence for the Rjukan Line. Permission for the construction of the power line was granted in 1968. Production of fertilizer was moved to Herøya and Glomfjord, and Rjukan transferred to production of kalkammonsalpeter in 1963 and ammonium nitrate in 1964.|$|E

5|$|Owsley studied law under John Boyle. After briefly {{serving in}} the state legislature, he was {{appointed}} by Governor Charles Scott to serve alongside Boyle on the Kentucky Court of Appeals. During his service on the court, Owsley {{was involved in the}} Old Court-New Court controversy. In 1824, the state legislature, unhappy with the court's rulings against debt relief legislation, attempted to abolish the court <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a new court. For a time, both courts operated simultaneously, and both claimed to be the court of last resort in the state. Supporters of the old court won control of the legislature and abolished the new court in 1826. Owsley resigned from the Court of Appeals two years later.|$|E
5|$|The Roseland Ballroom {{opened in}} its first Manhattan {{location}} at 51st Street in 1919, after moving from Philadelphia. It moved to its current location at 52nd Street in 1956, as a converted skating rink. The venue began as a hall for ballroom dancing and orchestra groups, but later shifted its focus through various eras of popular music, including disco, grunge, and EDM. While the Roseland Ballroom has seen performances from a both up-and-coming bands and established acts, rumors have been circulating since 1996 about the venue's demise, after Ginsberg filed plans to tear down its low-rise, three-story structure <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a 59-story high-rise. It was announced on October 19, 2013 that the Roseland Ballroom would be closing in April 2014, after over 50 years of operation at its current location.|$|E
5|$|The {{build-up}} for One Night Stand {{occurred on}} both Raw and SmackDown {{heading into the}} pay-per-view, but build-up behind the scenes began several months earlier, as WWE was bringing back ECW full-time. The news that WWE was planning to bring back ECW was leaked {{in the middle of}} April as Vince McMahon decided to revive ECW as a full-time brand. Reports beforehand stated that WWE was prepared to bring back ECW immediately after WrestleMania 22. WWE opted to cancel its webcast Velocity <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with the new ECW program. The new brand was officially confirmed by WWE on May 25, 2006, with its debut show airing on June 13, 2006 on the Sci Fi Channel.|$|E

5|$|After a long {{absence from}} politics, Marshall {{was called to}} one final act of public service. Upon the death of Martin D. Hardin who had been elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1823 but died before he could take office, Marshall pursued an {{abbreviated}} campaign for the vacant seat and defeated Jeptha Dudley {{by a margin of}} 3 votes. The primary issue of the day was the Old Court – New Court controversy, an attempt by the legislature to abolish the extant Court of Appeals <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a new court in retaliation for overturning a replevin law passed in a previous legislative session. Marshall enjoyed a higher level of support in this election by virtue of his support for the Old Court, which was the prevailing sentiment in his district. His actions in the session, however, appear to have been unremarkable, and he did not seek reelection {{at the end of his}} term.|$|E
5|$|GMG Radio {{was taken}} over by rival Global Radio in June 2012. Global's {{purchase}} of the company was referred to Ofcom, the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission amid concerns that Global's market share may be disproportionately large {{as a result of the}} deal, and consequently not in the public interest. GMG Radio subsequently changed its name to Real and Smooth Radio Ltd. A report issued by the Competition Commission in May 2013 highlighted competitiveness issues and recommended a full or partial sale of Real and Smooth. Real and Smooth Radio Ltd and Global continued to operate as separate companies while the takeover was investigated. Smooth moved its operations from Manchester to Global's London headquarters in October 2013. In February 2014, Global were given permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with another station. Global also sold eight of its regional stations, including three operated under the Smooth brand, and announced that Smooth would replace much of its Gold network on the medium wave frequency. The Smooth brand was relaunched as a network of regional stations in March 2014.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, Rowan was {{appointed}} to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, serving until his resignation 1821. He was again elected to the state legislature in 1823. With the state reeling from the Panic of 1819, Rowan became the leader of a group of legislators dedicated to enacting laws favorable to the state's large debtor class. He believed {{the will of the people}} was sovereign and roundly denounced the Court of Appeals for striking down debt relief legislation as unconstitutional. He led the effort to impeach the offending justices, and when that effort failed, spearheaded a movement to abolish the court entirely <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a new one, touching off the Old Court – New Court controversy. New Court partisans in the legislature elected Rowan to the U.S. Senate in 1824. During his term, the nascent Whig Party ascended to power in the state legislature, and at the expiration of his term in 1831, the Whigs replaced him with party founder Henry Clay.|$|E
