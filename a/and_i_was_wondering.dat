6000|$|... "I am {{not quite}} worn out; {{but is it}} not an unfair question, {{considering}} my present employment? This skein is getting mixed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> if you {{would allow me to}} help you in straightening it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah. I {{heard from}} Brander {{that she was}} shut up there, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> whether you had run against her. He is very savage at what he calls her vagaries. Did she get through the {{starvation}} all right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes when I'm {{alone in}} the bush I think of God. Mr Young has been {{talking to me about}} Him lately, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>and</b> wanting to know more about Him. Do you know {{anything}} about Him, father?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are like}} two fires of green weeds in a mealie patch, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> which {{of you will}} be the first to break into flame or whether you will both be choked by the reek of your own thoughts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We've {{just come}} on a visit, you know," [...] said Ozma. [...] "Both Dorothy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>wondering</b> how we should pass the day when we {{happened}} to think we'd not been to your Quadling Country for weeks, so we took the Sawhorse and rode straight here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{were many}} queer things inside, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> {{what they could}} be {{when all of a}} sudden I saw him. He was lying down, and there was {{something}} the matter with him. I tapped on the window to him and then I hurried back here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--"--Jno. Peters coughed tactfully--"I {{see that}} you are engaged with a client, Mr. Samuel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> if any little point of law had arisen with which you did not feel {{yourself}} quite capable of coping, in which case I might perhaps be of assistance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I'm {{very proud of}} the part I played," [...] and though Courthorne smiled there was a faint flush in his face. [...] "Still, you see, I hadn't a dollar then, and what could I do? Any way, that's done with, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> if you would let me congratulate you. Potter seems to be a general favorite." ...|$|E
40|$|Hamlin Garland, letter, 1913 March 3, to Francis W. Shepardson, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA. "In {{conversation}} with Nathaniel Butler I learned {{that you were}} in charge of the open lectures of the summer term at the Universtiy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> whether you cannot use me for another series similar to the one I gave several years ago. " [...] first line...|$|R
6000|$|... "Egad, Richard," [...] said my Lord, {{when we had}} got to my lodgings, [...] "I {{made him}} change colour, did I not? Do {{you know how the}} little fool looks to me? 'Od's life, he looks hunted, and cursed near brought to earth. We must fetch this thing to a point, Richard. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> what Chartersea's next move will be," [...] he added thoughtfully.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{question}} of mental equipment that was on the carpet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still <b>wondering</b> whether he meant what he said.|$|R
6000|$|We breakfasted as silently on {{his part}} as we had supped, but when we had finished, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> {{what he was going}} to let me do with myself, and on the whole what the deuce I had come for, he said, in the longest speech I had yet had from him, [...] "Wouldn't you like to come up and see what I've been doing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before {{you can go}} out on {{the road}} and learn the more {{complicated}} and higher details of the profession," [...] he said, [...] "you will, of course, have to work in the car-house with the men who install and repair the motors. (By this time I was sure that it was his daughter, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> how much stock he might own in the company.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Deringham seemed thoughtful. The man's grim code of honour, {{inflexible}} {{as it was}} primitive, caused her, for {{no apparent}} reason, indefinite misgivings, and she made a little gesture of weariness. [...] "I think," [...] she said, [...] "it {{would be better if}} we did not talk of Carnaby, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> if {{it would be possible to}} catch a trout if there is a little more wind presently." ...|$|E
60|$|While Robertson <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>wondering</b> what {{we should}} do with the poor old {{creature}} whom it seemed cruel to leave here to perish, she cleared up the question by suddenly expiring before our eyes. Uttering the name of someone with whom, doubtless, she had been familiar in her youth, three or four times over, she just sank down and seemed to go to sleep and on examination we found that she was dead. So we left her and went on.|$|R
40|$|Hamlin Garland, letter, 1913 March 8, to Jarvis Hunt, 53 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois, USA. "I {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in the design for the new building you are to erect on Michigan Avenue opposite the Public Library, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> whether you have not {{a photograph of the}} design which you could let me have [...] or rather, that you could let the Craftsman have to illustrate an article which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> writing for them on The New Chicago. " [...] first line...|$|R
6000|$|The boys {{resumed their}} seats. 'Your mamma <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>wondering</b> what you boys are to become, {{and we do}} not see any {{openings}} likely to occur here. Now, what should you say to us all emigrating?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] he said, [...] "I don't know; but, after all, it wouldn't {{be worth}} while our raising wheat here unless there were folks back East to eat it, and {{if some of}} them only eat it {{in the shape of}} dainty cakes that doesn't affect the question. Anyway, there's only another dance or two, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> whether I could drive you home; I've got Wyllard's Ontario sleigh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had noticed}} {{there was a}} kind of a village back of the beach, and enough scenery to outfit a dozen moving-picture shows. But I thought, of course, it was a cannibal suburb, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> whether I was to be served with carrots or mushrooms. And, as I say, this dressed-up man sits beside me, and we become friends in the space of a minute or two. For an hour we talked, and he told me all about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Naturally, I was {{somewhat}} abashed," [...] {{he said in}} the account he was presently called to give Isabel of the interview, [...] "but I remembered that I was an American citizen, and tried to maintain a decent composure. For several minutes we sat silent behind a dish of flabby cucumbers, expecting the dinner, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> whether I should address him in French or German,--for I knew you'd never forgive me if I let slip such a chance,--when he turned and spoke himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My father <b>and</b> mother, <b>I</b> mean," [...] I {{explained}} in some confusion, [...] "were just of the com--of the ordinary size. <b>And</b> what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>is,</b> whether you yourself would be sorry--in quite a general way, of course--if you found your practice going down like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can assure}} you that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> eminently respectable, but find other respectable people tiresome." [...] The man who wrote the {{foregoing}} certainly had me guessing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still <b>wondering</b> whether or not he'd have found me tiresome, or what the deuce he did mean.|$|R
5000|$|... “We were in {{the worst}} {{physical}} condition {{we have been in}} the season <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still <b>wondering</b> how some of them stayed in there as well as they did. These boys certainly are fighters and they’ve got plenty of guts. It’s hard to beat that kind of team.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{had been}} {{at work on a}} big double-sheet sketch, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> what people would think of it at home. The sight of that field taught me a good deal. It looked just like a bed of horrible toadstools in all colours, and--I'd never seen men in bulk go back to their {{beginnings}} before. So I began to understand that men and women were only material to work with, and that what they said or did was of no consequence. See? Strictly speaking, you might just as well put your ear down to the palette to catch what your colours are saying.' ...|$|E
60|$|But, {{sitting at}} work, {{not far from}} Doctor Strong, was a very pretty young lady--whom he called Annie, and who was his daughter, I supposed--who got {{me out of my}} {{difficulty}} by kneeling down to put Doctor Strong's shoes on, and button his gaiters, which she did with great cheerfulness and quickness. When she had finished, and we were going out to the schoolroom, I was much surprised to hear Mr. Wickfield, in bidding her good morning, address her as 'Mrs. Strong'; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> could she be Doctor Strong's son's wife, or could she be Mrs. Doctor Strong, when Doctor Strong himself unconsciously enlightened me.|$|E

6000|$|... "I thank you, indeed," [...] Malcolm replied. [...] "It will of {{all things}} be the most pleasant; the doctor has told me that <b>I</b> shall not <b>be</b> fit for duty until the spring, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>wondering</b> how ever <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> able {{to pass the time}} until then." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "My {{very dear}} Clive," [...] Alice wrote. [...] "I am feeling awfully low {{spirited}} dearest since hearing such very terrible news relating to this fearful war. It just feels {{too heavy to}} bear. Whenever will it end <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> always <b>wondering</b> how you <b>are,</b> my poor dear Clive away over in that wretched place..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no!" [...] said Willy; [...] "everybody is well, {{so far as}} I know. <b>I</b> {{guess you}} <b>are</b> <b>wondering</b> why there <b>is</b> nobody here to meet you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>wondering</b> at that too. They must have thought {{that you did not}} want to be bothered when you were {{attending}} to your baggage <b>and</b> things. <b>Is</b> anybody with you?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{house of}} Shaws stood some five full storeys high, not {{counting}} lofts. Well, as I advanced, {{it seemed to}} me the stair grew airier and a thought more lightsome; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> what might be the cause of this change, when a second blink of the summer lightning came and went. If I did not cry out, it was because fear had me by the throat; and if I did not fall, it was more by Heaven's mercy than my own strength. It was not only that the flash shone in on every side through breaches in the wall, so that I seemed to be clambering aloft upon an open scaffold, but the same passing brightness showed me the steps were of unequal length, and that one of my feet rested that moment within two inches of the well.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was walking}} {{the other day}} in a kitchen garden, which I find has somehow got {{attached}} to my premises, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> why I liked it. After a prolonged spiritual self-analysis I {{came to the conclusion that}} I like a kitchen garden because it contains things to eat. I do not mean that a kitchen garden is ugly; a kitchen garden is often very beautiful. The mixture of green and purple on some monstrous cabbage is much subtler and grander than the mere freakish and theatrical splashing of yellow and violet on a pansy. Few of the flowers merely meant for ornament are so ethereal as a potato. A kitchen garden is as beautiful as an orchard; but why is it that the word [...] "orchard" [...] sounds as beautiful as the word [...] "flower-garden," [...] and yet also sounds more satisfactory? I suggest again my extraordinarily dark and delicate discovery: that it contains things to eat.|$|E
6000|$|The next afternoon, {{while we}} were sitting in the park waiting for the Troy band to begin playing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> just when they would reach the [...] "Washington Post March," [...] which I like because I can always be sure of it, my unknown friends came strolling our way. The man looked bewildered and bored, with {{something}} of desperation in his troubled eye, and his wife looked tired and disheartened. The young girl, still in white duck, wore the same air of passive injury I had noted in her the night before. Their faces all three lighted up at sight of me; but they faded again at the cold and meagre response I made to their smiles under correction of my wife's fears of them. I own it was base of me; but I had begun to feel myself that it might be too large a contract to attempt their consolation, and, in fact, after one is fifty scarcely any romance will keep overnight.|$|E
50|$|We are all glad to {{hear from}} you and we are {{glad to hear}} you are all well and have got back home safe <b>and</b> well <b>i</b> hope you have done well by {{travelling}} on your account <b>and</b> situation <b>i</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> what had become of you all a few days a go and we did not know but you ware all dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was passing}} the 'ouse," [...] ses Bill Chambers, looking round at us, [...] "and I see an old man's {{face at the}} bedroom winder, <b>and</b> while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> who 'e <b>was</b> a hand come and drawed 'im away. I see 'im as plain as ever I see {{anything}} in my life, and the hand, too. Big and dirty it was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "P'r'aps you'd better start, in {{case she}} reckernizes my voice," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "Pitch it in strong about me <b>and</b> 'ow <b>I</b> <b>was</b> always <b>wondering</b> what had 'appened to her." ...|$|R
