40|$|Abstract—Web {{applications}} are becoming the predominant {{means by which}} users interact with online content. However, current authentication approaches use a single <b>authentication</b> <b>credential</b> to manage access permissions, which is too inflexible for distributed programs with unique security and privacy requirements for each component. In this paper, we introduce DAuth, an authorization mechanism that allows fine-grained and flexible control of access permissions derived from a single <b>authentication</b> <b>credential</b> for distributed consumers of web applications. We implement DAuth {{as a proxy for}} a Twitter social networking application within our distributed Elastic Application framework and find it introduces negligible overhead and requires only minor modification of existing applications. Through our evaluation, we demonstrate DAuth improves on existing web authentication mechanisms to support distributed web application consumers and can be implemented as a proxy to web applications that do not wish to develop their own implementation.

40|$|Abstract—Authentication using {{centralized}} methods is {{a primary}} trust mechanism within most large-scale, enterprise computer networks. This paper proposes using graphs to represent user authentication activity within the network. Using this mechanism over a real enterprise network dataset, we find that non-privileged users and users with system administration privileges have distinguishable graph attributes in terms of size and complexity. In addition, we find that user authentication graphs provide intuitive insights into network user behavior. We believe that understanding these differences in even greater detail will lead to improved user behavior profiling and the elusive detection of <b>authentication</b> <b>credential</b> misuse.

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, most of {{sensitive}} applications over insecure network {{are protected by}} some authenticated secure channel which is highly relies on specific authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocol. Nevertheless, the leakage of <b>authentication</b> <b>credential</b> used in AKE protocol somehow result in unauthorized exploitation of credential information via identity impersonation (IDI) attack. To {{address the problem of}} IDI, we introduce a new dynamic authentication factor for AKE protocols, i. e., the secret execution states, to either prevent IDI attack by detecting attempts thereof, or limit its consequences by on-line detecting situations of previously unidentified IDI. In this paper, we model the security for authenticated key exchange with synchronized states (AKESS) based on Bellare-Rogaway model, and we particularly formalize the IDI and IDI detection. We propose a generic execution states synchronization framework for AKE, in which we utilize the session key to generate the secret execution states on both sides, and present a new AKESS protocol which is provably secure in the standard model. Our goal is to enhance the security of existing authenticated key exchange with long-lived key (AKELL) protocols by equipping them with the capabilities of both IDI prevention and detection without modifications on those protocols...|$|R

In addition, Liberty described {{a circle of}} trust, where each participating domain is trusted to accurately document the processes used to identify a user, the type of authentication system used, and any policies associated with the resulting <b>authentication</b> <b>credentials.</b> Other members of the circle of trust may examine these policies to determine whether to trust such information.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] With {{the passing}} of each day, Grid {{computing}} and Cloud computing are becoming an important integral part of various applications. More and more software professionals and corporate are focusing on these high performance computing mechanisms. These mechanisms are tremendously evolving as users are also continuously striving for smarter applications and solutions. And as these mechanisms are evolving, their development environment, architecture, middleware and security aspects are also evolving. Security is now became an area of concern for all business applications. The information security issues are there all over the field of Grid computing. One {{of the keys to}} survive new and emerging threats is by providing policy based access and context sensitive access to the users. Businesses should ensure that they only give the right access to the right people and they should get the information on who is on their network and what they are doing. This paper discusses and reviews various properties, characteristics, and challenges of the security middleware approaches available. The review reveals that many options of security in middleware are available but there are still many issues and challenges yet to be solved. The information provided in this paper can be used by those organizations which needs proper security mechanism in distributed communication so that a strong security model can be devised further. This paper also puts a challenge to us to devise proper security policies for such communication protocols.

50|$|SMTP AUTH {{can be used}} also on port 25. Usually, servers reject RCPT TO {{commands}} that imply relaying unless <b>authentication</b> <b>credentials</b> {{have been}} accepted. The specification recommends that servers issue 530 5.7.0 Authentication required in response to most commands in case the server is configured to require authentication and the client hasn't done it yet. Only servers listening on port 587, or private servers, should be configured that way, not a Message eXchange (MX). However, the historical trait that SMTP is not authenticated by default results in a different behavior with regard to access protocols, in some cases; for example, when using AUTH EXTERNAL after STARTTLS.|$|E

40|$|As {{the number}} of {{connected}} applications increases, user convenience makes them use the same password, which can create vulnerabilities in an organization’s infrastructure. Therefore, those with security concerns regarding these activities, conducted in the electronic environment, came to {{support the idea of}} ​​Single Sign-On systems, having the user in mind. This concept facilitates the authentication process to various resources available on the Internet, or locally, using a single pair of credentials, only once, so it makes the „one for all” password, the method of writing passwords on post-it’s glued to the monitor, or keeping them stored in unsecured text files, sent into oblivion. This paper aims to make a comprehensive analysis of the infrastructure of security and authentication systems on the market. On the other hand, the project presents the implementation of several open source solutions such as OpenID, NTLM in PHP or the Central Authentication Service. For the application that uses OpenID an online store that has an administration page, to which access is restricted using OpenID credentials, was further secured by filtering these IDs in a MySQL database to prevent access to anyone having a valid OpenID credential. For the demonstration of NTLM enabled SSO, another website is used in which access has been blocked to a page. For accessing the page, a valid Windows <b>authentication</b> <b>credential</b> is required. Both the online-shop and demonstration site for NTLM are written in PHP. In addition, the systems using them are implemented also using PHP.
