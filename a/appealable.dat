They consist of a chief probation officer, one or more juvenile probation officers, and support staff. Youth Courts have jurisdiction over misdemeanor and felony acts committed by those charged as a juvenile under the law. There is a Youth Court in every judicial district, and ecisions of the Youth Court are <b>appealable</b> directly to the Montana Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|The Montana Worker's Compensation Court was {{established}} by the Montana Workers' Compensation Act in 1975. There is a single Workers' Compensation Court. It has a single judge, appointed by the governor. The Worker's Compensation Court has statewide jurisdiction, and holds trials in Billings, Great Falls, Helena, Kalispell, and Missoula. The court hears cases arising under the Montana Workers' Compensation Act, and is the court of original jurisdiction for reviews of orders and regulations issued by the Montana Department of Labor and Industry. Decisions of the court are <b>appealable</b> directly to the Montana Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|The {{petition}} must be timely filed {{within the}} allowable time. The Court cannot extend {{the time for}} filing which is set by statute. A $60 filing fee must be paid when the petition is filed. Once the petition is filed, payment of the underlying tax ordinarily is postponed until the case has been decided. In certain tax disputes involving $50,000 or less, taxpayers may elect to have the case conducted under the Court's simplified small tax case procedure. Trials in small tax cases generally are less formal and result in a speedier disposition. However, decisions entered pursuant to small tax case procedures are not <b>appealable</b> and are not precedential.|$|E
25|$|Michigan's {{personal}} income tax is set to a flat rate of 4.25%. In addition, 22cities impose income taxes; rates are set at 1% for residents and 0.5% for non-residents in all but four cities. Michigan's state sales tax is 6%, though items such as food and medication are exempted from sales tax. Property taxes are assessed on the local level, but every property owner's local assessment contributes six mills (a rate of $6 per $1000 of property value) to the statutory State Education Tax. Property taxes are <b>appealable</b> to local boards of review and need {{the approval of the}} local electorate to exceed millage rates prescribed by state law and local charters. In 2011, the state repealed its business tax and replaced it with a 6% corporate income tax which substantially reduced taxes on business. Article IX of the Constitution of the State of Michigan also provides limitations on how much the state can tax.|$|E
25|$|Far {{and away}} the most common mode by which a case reaches the Supreme Court is through an appeal from a {{decision}} rendered by a lower court. Appealed cases generally originate from lawsuits or criminal indictments filed and tried before the trial courts. These decisions of the trial courts may then be elevated on appeal to the Court of Appeals, or more rarely, directly to the Supreme Court if only “questions of law” are involved. Apart from decisions of the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court may also directly review on appeal decisions rendered by the Sandiganbayan and the Court of Tax Appeals. Decisions rendered by administrative agencies are not directly <b>appealable</b> to the Supreme Court, they must be first challenged before the Court of Appeals. However, decisions of the Commission on Elections may be elevated directly for review to the Supreme Court, although the procedure is not, strictly speaking, {{in the nature of}} an appeal.|$|E
500|$|Two {{hours after}} the event ended, Castroneves was judged to have {{overtaken}} under caution and was demoted from third to fourth. Castroneves stated {{that he did not}} understand why the penalty was issued after the race and that it appeared [...] "very unfair". He said that the penalty was not <b>appealable.</b> Da Matta felt Castroneves had forgotten a change in the pit lane speed limit, and that he did not abide by the series' regulations. Nevertheless, he was happy {{that he was able to}} finish third, and revealed that his team held their own celebration after hearing about the penalty. Although Servià finished in tenth place, race officials had recorded his result as 15th. His team manager Phil Howard met with CART officials to discuss the issue and Servià's final finishing position was corrected to tenth. Ninth-place finisher Franchitti said his car was good in the event's first half, although as the temperature dropped it became [...] "nervous" [...] entering and exiting the track's turns in the race's second stint, and stated he could have dealt with his result had he gained his desired finishing position.|$|E
500|$|In the January–March 1995 {{edition of}} El Machete, the EBP {{published}} an essay discussing {{the origins of}} corruption, reaching the conclusion that [...] "the institutions creates by the capitalist and economic power to regulate the daily life of its citizens [...] represents the biggest example of corruption" [...] by proving a stage for corrupt individuals seeking individual benefit. In calling for a [...] "political, economic and social revolution", the organization concluded that only [...] "an organized force [...] political liberty." [...] In another section, the organization argued that Roselló was an [...] "inexperienced politician and administration" [...] and a [...] "figure manufactored by the wealthy interest to do their bidding". The EPB cited their belief that the governor was carrying out an agenda to discredit and dismantle the public workforce {{in an attempt to}} facilitate statehood by reducing public spending and making Puerto Rico more <b>appealable</b> to the economically conservative elements in the United States. To counter this, the organization urged unions to move [...] "beyond economic issues and to open [...] national struggle" [...] against privatization efforts taken by the Rosselló administration. The EPB also criticized the governor and several politicians and such as Romero Barceló, Baltasar Corrada del Rio and General Emilio Díaz Colón that pursued {{the construction of a new}} home base for the United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) at Puerto Rico in anticipation of the approaching deadline that the Torrijos-Carter Treaties established for the transfer of control over the Panama Canal from the United States to Panama in 1977. [...] The organization believed that this was an attempt to benefit economically and to fully integrate Puerto Rico into the military apparatus of the United States, [...] " [...] sip by sip". Led by advisor Alberto Goachet, the initiative offered to provide satellite dishes, ports, transportation and low cost accommodations and facilities. Citing that the base would serve as to launch incursions that secure control over Latin America, the EPB called out the lack of action by the PIP and its president, Manuel Rodríguez Orellana. The organization also expressed it support to the efforts of eviromentalist organizations that opposed the passing of a Japanese vessel carrying a load of plutonium through the Mona Passage in its route from France to the Panama Canal.|$|E

2500|$|On Friday, May 4, a U.S. District Court Judge {{issued a}} Temporary Restraining Order precluding the State of Tennessee from {{executing}} Workman until a preliminary injunction hearing assesses {{the constitutionality of}} Tennessee's revised procedure for administering lethal injections. However, this restraining order was vacated by a two-to-one decision of the U.S. Court for Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on Monday, May 7 and Workman was moved to death watch. The decision to vacate the restraining order was stridently criticized, on both procedural and substantive grounds, by the dissenting Judge Cole. Judge Cole wrote, [...] "The majority's opinion rests on a profound jurisdictional defect: There is no <b>appealable</b> order before this Court. The district court issued a temporary restraining order, not a preliminary injunction [...] [...] [...] The district court's TRO cannot be magically transformed into a preliminary injunction, which is an <b>appealable</b> order, even though the State {{and a majority of}} this Court may wish it." ...|$|E

[...] In the re-examination process, which involves several rounds of discussion between the USPTO and the parties, the USPTO initially agreed with Consumer Watchdog and rejected all the claims in all three patents, however in response, WARF amended the claims of all three patents {{to make them more}} narrow, and in 2008 the USPTO found the amended claims in all three patents to be patentable. The decision on one of the patents (7,029,913) was <b>appealable,</b> while the decisions on the other two were not. Consumer Watchdog appealed the granting of the '913 patent to the USPTO's Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (BPAI) which granted the appeal, and in 2010 the BPAI decided that the amended claims of the '913 patent were not patentable. [...] However, WARF was able to re-open prosecution of the case and did so, amending the claims of the '913 patent again to make them more narrow, and in January 2013 the amended claims were allowed.|$|E

(1) No Wisconsin {{resident}} having minor issue {{not in his}} {{custody and}} which he is under obligation to support by any court order or judgment, may marry in this state or elsewhere, without the order of either the court of this state which granted such judgment or support order, or the court having divorce jurisdiction in the county of this state where such minor issue resides or where the marriage license application is made. No marriage license shall be issued to any such person except upon court order. The court, within 5 days after such permission is sought by verified petition in a special proceeding, shall direct a court hearing {{to be held in}} the matter to allow said person to submit proof of his compliance with such prior court obligation. No such order shall be granted, or hearing held, unless both parties to the intended marriage appear, and unless the person, agency, institution, welfare department or other entity having the legal or actual custody of such minor issue is given notice of such proceeding by personal service of a copy of the petition at least 5 days prior to the hearing, except that such appearance or notice may be waived by the court upon good cause shown, and, if the minor issue were of a prior marriage, unless a 5-day notice thereof is given to the family court commissioner of the county where such permission is sought, who shall attend such hearing, and to the family court commissioner of the court which granted such divorce judgment. If the divorce judgment was granted in a foreign court, service shall be made on the clerk of that court. Upon the hearing, if said person submits such proof and makes a showing that such children are not then and are not likely thereafter to become public charges, the court shall grant such order, a copy of which shall be filed in any prior proceeding under s. 52.37 or divorce action of such person in this state affected thereby; otherwise permission for a license shall be withheld until such proof is submitted and such showing is made, but any court order withholding such permission is an <b>appealable</b> order.

50|$|A decree {{is often}} a final determination, {{but there are also}} {{interlocutory}} decrees.

5000|$|Another {{important}} {{election that}} an EEO Counselor must inform the counselee of is mixed cases. Essentially, a mixed {{case is a}} claim of discrimination that is <b>appealable</b> to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). Regulations related to mixed cases {{can be found at}} 29 C.F.R. § 1614.302. To determine if MSPB may have jurisdiction there are two important questions that must be answered. First, does the employee have standing to appear before the MSPB? [...] "For example, a probationary employee does not have standing to go to MSPB on an EEO-based claim. Employees of certain agencies, e.g., the FBI, CIA, TVA, the U.S. Postal Service, and certain non-appropriated fund activities (such as the Army and Air Force Exchange) do not have standing. Those employees may, however, pursue their claims through the regular EEO process with their agency." [...] Secondly, does the claim occur from an action <b>appealable</b> to MSPB? Commonly, the more severe the personnel action at hand, the more likely it will be <b>appealable</b> to MSPB, e.g., removal, suspension for more than 14 days, and reduction in grade.|$|E
5000|$|... 2. The District Court's {{denial of}} {{qualified}} immunity, {{to the extent}} it turned on a question of law, is an <b>appealable</b> [...] "final decision" [...] {{within the meaning of}} 28 U.S.C. § 1291 notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment. Qualified immunity, similar to absolute immunity, is an entitlement not to stand trial under certain circumstances. Such entitlement is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability; and like absolute immunity, it is effectively lot if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial. Accordingly, the reasoning that underlies the immediate appealability of the denial of absolute immunity indicates that the denial of qualified immunity should be similarly <b>appealable</b> under the [...] "collateral order" [...] doctrine; in each case, the district court's decision is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. The denial of qualified immunity also meets the additional criteria for an <b>appealable</b> interlocutory order: it conclusively determines the disputed question, and it involves a claim of rights separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action. P P. 524-530.|$|E
