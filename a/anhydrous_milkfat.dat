40|$|Milkfat was {{extracted}} quantitatively from dairy {{foods and}} the vitamins A, E and beta-carotene in the extract were analysed by normal phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a silica column, a fluorescence detector and a UV/visible detector. Products such as butter and <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milkfat</b> were dissolved simply in hexane, whereas milk and milk powders underwent a Rose-Gottlieb fat extraction prior to HPLC analysis. The extraction method used as superior to commonly used saponification procedures {{in terms of}} speed as well as reduced loss and isomerization of the vitamin components in the food, because the chemical form of the vitamin is not changed to a less stable form such as retinol during extraction. The individual geometrical isomers of vitamin A, which possess different in vivo vitamin activities, were uniquely identified and quantified. Recovery studies showed satisfactory results for all three vitamins. The simultaneous nature of the assay allowed the estimation of the total vitamin A activity of the food because both vitamin A and pro-vitamin A (beta-carotene) were quantified. The single extraction and single HPLC analysis used for the three vitamins made the method well suited for routine work. (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Limite...|$|E
40|$|Under {{the trade}} name lipolysed milkfat (LMF), {{concentrated}} cheese flavours obtained via enzymatic treatments of cheese (or other dairy substrates) {{have been made}} available in increasing numbers. In this research effort, (<b>anhydrous)</b> <b>milkfats</b> from cows, ewes and goats were used as substrates for production of cheesy flavours. Those milkfats were subjected to modifications brought about by ten different (commercial) lipases and one cutinase, and the free fatty acids released were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography. Both the degrees of hydrolysis and the free fatty acid profiles of the final products {{were similar to those}} reported for several LMF products, although specific keynotes could be pinpointed. Consequently, those milkfats may represent alternative raw materials for manufacture of cheesy flavours, while contributing to alleviate the problem derived from the increasing surplus of milkfat in Western countries...|$|R
40|$|Blends of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milkfat</b> (AMF) and {{linseed oil}} (70 / 30), and AMF, {{rapeseed}} oil (RO) and linseed oil (LO), 70 / 20 / 10, were submitted to enzymatic interesterification. The oxidative {{stability of the}} blends, the interesterified (IE) blends and IE blends with 50 ppm -tocopherol added as antioxidant were studied. Samples were stored in open flasks at 60 °C, 25 °C and 4 °C, and periodically submitted to peroxide, p-anisidine, TBA value determination and UV measurement at 232 and 268 nm. The analysis of volatile compounds {{was carried out by}} SPME for the samples stored at 60 °C. Peroxides appeared to be the only significant oxidation products after 12 weeks storage at 4 °C. As expected, the binary blends (BB) were more sensitive to oxidation than the ternary blends (TB). The BB were associated with increased volatile emission compared to TB. Interesterification led to variable effects on the oxidation of fat mixtures, depending on composition and temperature (beneficial effect on BB, at both 25 °C and 60 °C, and a rather neutral effect on TB). The IE blends exhibited higher volatile release prior to ageing. A pro-oxidant effect of -tocopherol addition was observed at 25 °C on both BB and TB. At 60 °C, an antioxidant effect was observed on TB. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Lipozyme TL IM {{was used}} in a solvent-free batch and microaqueous system for enzymatic interesterification of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milkfat</b> (AMF) with linseed oil (LO) in binary blends and with {{rapeseed}} oil (RO) in one ternary blend. The aim was to obtain and characterize physicochemically fats enriched with unsaturated C- 18 fatty acids (oleic, linoleic, and, especially, linolenic acids) from natural vegetable oils. Binary blends of AMF/LO 100 / 0, 90 / 10, 80 / 20, 70 / 30, and 60 / 40 (w/w) were interesterified. The change in triacylglycerol (TAG) profiles showed that quasi-equilibrium conditions were reached after 4 - 6 h of reaction. Free fatty acid contents < 1 %. The decrease in solid fat content and in dropping point temperature obtained with increasing content of LO and interesterification resulted in good plastic properties for the products originating from the blends 70 / 30 and 60 / 40. This was confirmed by textural measurements. Melting profiles determined by differential scanning calorimetry showed complete disappearance of low-melting TAGs from LO {{and the formation of}} intermediary species with a lower melting temperature. Oxidative stability of the interesterified products was diminished with increasing LO content, resulting in low oxidation induction times. A ternary blend composed of AMF/RO/LO 70 / 20 / 10 gave satisfactory rheological and oxidative properties, fulfilling the requirements for a marketable spread and, moreover, offering increased potential health benefits due to the enriched content in polyunsatured fatty acid residues.

40|$|Halloumi {{cheese is}} made in some Middle Eastern {{countries}} from sheep's and goat's milk. It is a hard, unripened white cheese that tastes like immature Cheddar, {{and it has the}} capacity to melt and stretch when heated. The present investigation was undertaken to provide information on the manufacture of Halloumi cheese from fresh cow's milk, to define a process for its manufacture from recombined milk, and to examine the application of ultrafiltration procedures to Halloumi manufacture. The first part of the research programme was conducted {{in order to determine the}} optimal manufacturing conditions for making Halloumi from fresh cow's milk, and to establish appropriate methods of measuring physical properties of the cheese (stretchability, meltability and fat loss). It was found that those manufacturing variables which altered the rate and extent of acid development (percentage of starter, priming, cooking temperature and time) had a marked effect on cheese physical properties. These variables could be altered by the cheesemaker to optimize Halloumi properties. previous reports indicated that Halloumi with desired properties could not be made from recombined milk. The second part of this thesis describes a study of the manufacture of Halloumi from recombined milk (milk made by recombining skim milk powder with <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milkfat).</b> Two main reasons for this were considered, namely, the effect of homogenization treatment used in the recombining process, and the quality of the powder used. It was demonstrated that high homogenization pressures resulted in poor stretchability and meltability of the cheese. In contrast low pressure homogenization gave cheese with satisfactory properties. A model based on the viscoelastic behaviour of polymer systems was described in an attempt to explain how the homogenization treatments influence the stretching behaviour of the cheese network, and it was possible to verify the model in suitable experiments. The preheat temperatures of the skim milk used in the manufacture of skim milk powders were also shown to markedly affect the properties of the cheese. High preheat temperature resulted in reduced stretchability and meltability of the cheese. It was likely that this was due to alteration of the mineral balance and to denaturation of whey proteins. The concentration of total solids prior to spray drying was shown to have no significant effect on the properties of the cheese. In the final part of the investigation, the application of UF to the manufacture of Halloumi cheese was studied using fresh UF milk, and skim milk powder prepared from UF skim milk. When a 5 : 1 UF concentrate of fresh milk was used, some modification in the setting time and cutting device was necessary. The quality of UF Halloumi was very similar to that of the control cheese. In considering the manufacture of Halloumi from recombined milk using UF skim milk powder, the effects on the cheese quality of variations in the ratio of protein to fat, in the solids concentration of the recombined milk, and in the calcium content of the UF skim milk powder were investigated. Best results were obtained when the cheese was manufactured from recombined milk with a low protein-to-fat ratio. The use of low-calcium UF skim milk powder, as opposed to high-calcium powder, resulted in some improvement in the quality of the cheese. Varying the concentration of the recombined milk solids had no significant effect on the cheese properties. The present investigation has demonstrated that good quality Halloumi cheese having the desirable typical stretchability and meltability can be made not only from fresh cow's milk, but also from recombined and UF milks provided that appropriate materials and manufacturing procedures are used...|$|E
40|$|Air-suspension {{particle}} coating is {{a process}} by which thin coatings are applied to powder particles. The coatings can be formulated to act as permeable barriers to increase powder shelf-life or to impart controlled release character. The ultimate objective of a coating operation is to produce individual particles, each with a well-controlled, even coating. This project {{was focused on the}} air-suspension coating of fine powders of ~ 100 µm in diameter for the dairy industry. Despite the widespread use of the technology in the pharmaceutical industry, its use in the food industry has been limited. Little is known about the fundamental mechanisms, and so published work to date is product and equipment specific and is statistical in the way the experimental design and analysis has been approached. This 'black box' approach is time consuming and costly. Better methods based on an understanding of the physical and chemical mechanisms are needed to deal with the numerous products and constantly changing formulations typical of the dairy industry. This thesis proposes a new approach to air-suspension particle coating research. The basis of this 'micro-level process approach', is to deconvolute the complex coating process into smaller manageable parts based on classical physical phenomena for which descriptions already exist. The thesis identifies and develops an understanding of the key micro-level processes controlling coated product quality and process performance. Four were selected for further study: drying, droplet impact and spreading, and stickiness which encompasses the two key micro-level processes of droplet impact and adherence and inter-particle agglomeration. They were studied separately to deconvolute the variable effects and interactions. Kinetic data were collected for the drying droplets containing maltodextrins, whey protein isolate and gum arabic. A mathematical model, based on 'ideal shrinkage' was developed to predict the drying kinetics of single droplets with particular interest {{in the development of the}} surface glass transition temperature. The model accurately predicted the kinetics until significant morphological changes occurred in the droplet. To better predict the kinetics late in the drying process, the droplet radius was set to be constant at a time based on the surface proximity to the surface glass transition temperature (critical X concept). This was done to arrest droplet shrinkage in line with experimental observations and to more accurately depict the drying of high molecular weight, amorphous glass forming polymers. After this point, a new flexible calculation scheme was used to better predict the variation in internal droplet structure as either a dense, 'collapsed shell' structure or a 'dense skin-porous crumb' structure. Further study should focus on the surface and internal droplet structure (porosity and mechanical integrity) development during drying, particularly the conditions leading to the arresting of the droplet radius and the subsequent rate of skin thickness progression. The critical X concept was used to make industrial-scale predictions of the optimum drying conditions that ensure maximum droplet impact and adherence efficiency and minimum inter-particle agglomeration in a Würster-style coating operation. This enabled the prediction of two key design parameters, the nozzle distance from the powder impact point and the Würster insert height. The span in design parameters showed that there is significant opportunity for design optimisation based on the critical X concept. A probe tack test was used to map the level of stickiness of droplets of different coating materials as they dried. As skin formation progressed, the stickiness passed through a maximum, in most cases to arrive at a point at which the droplet was no longer sticky at all (non-adhesive state). The maximum point of stickiness represents the ideal state to ensure successful droplet-substrate impact and adherence. The minimum point of stickiness represents the ideal state to prevent unwanted inter-particle agglomeration. The time interval between the onset of stickiness and the non-adhesive state was particularly dependent on the addition of plasticisers, but also on the formulation and the drying air conditions. Future work should look to establish a possible relationship between the surface glass transition temperature and the probe tack test stickiness measurements. The impact and spreading of droplets containing maltodextrin DE 5 on to solid <b>anhydrous</b> <b>milkfat</b> was studied using a high speed video camera. It was found that the final spread diameter was able to be fixed close to the maximum spread diameter by using surfactants, thus avoiding significant recoil. Because existing literature focuses on predicting the maximum spread diameter, this work defines a need for adequate prediction methods for the final spread diameter, as this is the significant parameter in coating applications. Formulation and operating guidelines were established to independently optimise each micro-level process. These were used in a series of population based coating experiments in a pilot-scale Würster coater. This study highlighted the limited flexibility of the standard 'off-the-shelf' Würster coating apparatus for the coating of fine sized dairy powders. Because of this, the validation of the guidelines were inconclusive and optimisation could not be carried out. Further validation work is required on a custom-built apparatus for dairy powders. This work has advanced the fundamental knowledge of the coating process and is independent of material, equipment and scale. This knowledge, based on physical and chemical mechanisms, can be used to develop coating formulations and identify optimum process conditions for successful coating in less time and at less expense than is current practice. The next step is to put the guidelines into practice and craft the engineering of a continuous coating apparatus for dairy powder applications...|$|E
