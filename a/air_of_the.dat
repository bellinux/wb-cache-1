5|$|Soon {{after his}} birth, in {{accordance}} with the traditions of the Quraysh, Khalid was sent to a Bedouin tribe in the desert, where a foster mother nursed him and brought him up in the clear, dry and unpolluted <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> desert. At the age of five or six, he returned to his parents in Mecca. During his childhood Khalid suffered a mild attack of smallpox, which he survived, but it left some pockmarks on his left cheek.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{to double}} his $7,000 salary from the {{previous}} season, Henderson became embroiled in a contract dispute with the Red Wings prior to the 1966–67 NHL season, before the team acceded to his demands. He then spent the year attempting to overcome injuries; a case of tracheitis forced him to miss several early season games and led the team to consider having him play wearing a surgical mask {{to protect against the}} cold <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arena. Henderson eventually spent time in the dry air of Arizona to cure the ailment, but he also suffered from torn chest muscles and ultimately missed a third of the season. On the ice, Henderson scored 21 goals and 40 points in 49 games.|$|E

5|$|The Prana (breath, vital <b>air)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body is {{dispersed}} {{within and}} outside the body. The first aim of yoga is to become aware and control this vital air, to be equal to or lower than the inner fire within one's body. This inner fire resides in the middle part of the body, and he calls it the Nabhi (center) and a Chakra. This is the residence of the Jiva, and the vital air nourishes it from below while one is alive. Just above this Nabhi is the kundalini which normally is dormant. Yoga awakens her, by bringing vital air and heat to her.|$|E
5|$|Operation Varsity was {{the only}} time the Locust was used in action with the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment or the British Army as a whole. A report issued {{at the end of a}} conference held by the Director (<b>Air)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War Office in January 1946 {{confirmed}} that the Locust design was considered obsolete; any light tanks to be used in post-war airborne formations would be made from completely new designs. The British Army disposed of a small number of Locusts by transferring them to foreign militaries. Several had their main armaments removed and were used by the Belgian Army as command tanks for their M4 Sherman regiments, and a few Locusts even found their way back to the U.S., where they had their turrets removed and served as agricultural tractors. A larger number of Locusts served with the Egyptian Army, replacing a number of older tank models, such as the Vickers-Armstrong Mark V light tank, that the Egyptian military had acquired during the interwar period. Several company-sized units of Locusts were used by the Egyptians during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.|$|E
25|$|The CPR mask is the {{preferred}} method of ventilating a patient when only one rescuer is available.

25|$|The city of Pécs {{is located}} {{near to the}} border of Croatia. Its {{southern}} part is rather plain whereas its northern part belongs to slope of the Mecsek mountain.

25|$|In large office towers, the {{lighting}} system is {{integrated with the}} heating and ventilation system.

However, this waste heat becomes a liability when using air conditioning.|$|E
25|$|The {{attempt was}} {{accomplished}} by reaching a speed of Mach 2.1, then pulling up to create a ballistic trajectory beyond the altitude its wings could continue to function. The engines flamed out in the thin atmosphere, and the aircraft rolled onto its back. This had already been experienced in previous flights, and so the pilot simply released the controls and the aircraft regained control naturally as it descended back into the thicker <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time as the Second World War campaigns against the Axis Forces in Africa and Italy, British and American forces were also {{fighting}} the Japanese in the Pacific. This campaign began on 8 December 1941, the day after the Japanese attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor, and took place in the sea and <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean as well as on the ground, with the Allies defending Malaya and Singapore against Japanese invasion.|$|E
25|$|For Psyche's third task, she {{is given}} a crystal vessel in which to collect the black water spewed by {{the source of the}} rivers Styx and Cocytus. Climbing the cliff from which it issues, she is daunted by the foreboding <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> place and dragons slithering through the rocks, and falls into despair. Jupiter himself takes pity on her, and sends his eagle to battle the dragons and {{retrieve}} the water for her.|$|E
25|$|Experts soon {{agreed that}} the cause was a {{hydrogen}} explosion. Almost certainly the hydrogen was formed inside the reactor vessel because of falling water levels exposing zircaloy structures/fuel assembly cladding, which then reacted with steam and produced hydrogen, with the hydrogen subsequently vented into the containment building. When the hydrogen reached ignition concentration in the <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secondary containment building, an ignition source such as a spark triggered a hydrogen-oxygen explosion, blowing out the walls of this building from the inside.|$|E

25|$|The village's Victorian and Edwardian {{expansion}} {{was largely}} {{a response to the}} greater commuting opportunities available following the arrival of the railway in the village in 1869. The laying of a railway line through Kilmacolm occurred in order to provide a direct boat train link between Glasgow's St Enoch station and the harbour at Princes Pier in Greenock. The clean <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parish was hailed as having great health benefits, attracting both visitors and new residents who constructed significant residential properties in the village.|$|E
25|$|Australia's {{climate is}} governed largely by {{its size and}} by the hot, sinking <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{subtropical}} high pressure belt. This moves north and south with Antarctica. But it is variable, with frequent droughts lasting several seasons—thought to be caused {{in part by the}} El Niño-Southern Oscillation. The climate varies widely due to its large geographical size, but by far the largest part of Australia is desert or semi-arid. Only the south-east and south-west corners have a temperate climate and moderately fertile soil. The northern part of the country has a tropical climate, varied between tropical rainforests, grasslands and part desert.|$|E
25|$|Autumn in the United Kingdom lasts from September to November. The {{season is}} notorious for being unsettledas cool polar air moves southwards {{following}} the sun, it meets the warm <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tropics and produces {{an area of}} great disturbance along which the country lies. This combined with the warm ocean due to heating throughout the spring and summer, produces the unsettled weather of autumn. In addition, when the air is particularly cold temperatures on land may be colder than the ocean, resulting in significant amounts of condensation and clouds which bring rain to the country.|$|E

25|$|On 20 November 1970, the two Warning Stars, {{using the}} call signs Frog 01 and Frog 02 respectively, took off ten minutes apart at 22:00 from Korat to take {{station at the}} low {{altitude}} Alpha orbit over the Gulf of Tonkin, with Frog 02 as a backup standby. The 17-man crews were advised in the <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature of the rescue mission and their role, providing MiG warning and directing Air Force F-4 Phantom CAP intercepts. As Frog 01 began its climb to the higher Bravo orbit, it experienced a ruptured oil line that forced the shutdown of one engine. As planned, Frog 02 became the primary aircraft when Frog 01 made an emergency landing at Danang.|$|E
25|$|Lead weights can be {{coated with}} a {{protective}} outer layer such as plastic or paint, and this is commonly used for lead abatement. This prevents the lead from corroding or being ground into dust by rubbing, and helps to cushion impacts. However the protection is reduced if the coating is cracked or otherwise damaged. Soft plastics may become brittle over time due to UV degradation {{from the sun and}} loss of plasticizers, leading to cracking and shattering. Encapsulation materials are usually of near neutral buoyancy in water, and reduce the average density of the weights, making the weights slightly less effective, and increasing the overall weight in <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diving equipment.|$|E
25|$|Decatur came to {{love the}} sea and sailing in a {{roundabout}} manner. When Stephen was eight years old, he developed a severe case of whooping cough. In those days, a supposed tonic for this condition was exposure to the salt <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea. It was decided that Stephen Jr. would accompany his father aboard a merchant ship on his next voyage to Europe. Sailing across the Atlantic and back {{proved to be an}} effective remedy, and Decatur came home completely recovered. In the days following young Stephen's return he was jubilant about his adventure on the high sea and spoke of wanting to go sailing often. His parents had different aspirations, especially his mother who had hopes that Stephen would one day become an Episcopal clergyman, and tried to discourage the eight-year-old from such jaunty ambitions, fearing such would distract Stephen from his studies.|$|E
