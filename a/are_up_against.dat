2500|$|David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill, {{concerned}} that the violence would cause {{the collapse of the}} new Northern Ireland administration, organised a meeting in London between Irish republican leader Michael Collins and Sir James Craig, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, both to try to stop the IRA violence which Collins had been tacitly encouraging and supporting, and to pressure Craig to provide more protection for Catholics. Craig denied the nationalist assertion that the McMahon killings were part of an anti-Catholic pogrom on behalf of state forces, telling the Parliament of Northern Ireland that, [...] "no such thing has ever been the policy of Protestants here ... The Ulster men <b>are</b> <b>up</b> <b>against,</b> not Catholics but ... up against rebels, that they <b>are</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> murder, Bolshevism and up against those enemies not only of Ulster but of the [...] Empire".|$|E

For a multitude unused to discipline is a hindrance to itself, when successful, in completing the victory, when routed, in taking to flight. Besides your forefathers, when but few in number, have many a time conquered multitudes; what then is the natural consequence of the glories of your ancestry, your constant exercises, your military discipline, but that though fewer in number, you should overcome multitudes?"

2500|$|On Monday 8 January, Pye Records {{issued a}} 45 rpm single {{of the song}} [...] "I'm Backing Britain" [...] {{supporting}} the campaign. Written by Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent, and sung by Bruce Forsyth, the chorus included [...] "The feeling is growing, so let's keep it going, the good times are blowing our way". All involved in making the single took cuts in their fees or royalties so that the single sold for 5 shillings instead of the going rate of 7s d. Forsyth happily endorsed the campaign: [...] "The country has always done its best when it is up against the wall. If everyone realises what we <b>are</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> {{we can get out}} of trouble easily." [...] However, the song did not make the charts; it sold only 7319 copies.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{time after}} the start of Gheorghe Tătărescu's premiership and Ion Inculeț's {{leadership}} of the Internal Affairs Ministry, repression of the Legion ceased, a measure which reflected Carol's hope to ensure a new period of stability. In 1936, during a youth congress in Târgu Mureș, Codreanu agreed to the formation of a permanent Death Squad, which immediately showed its goals with the killing of Mihai Stelescu by a group deemed Decemviri (led by Ion Caratănase), neutralizing the Crusades campaign of exposing the Guard's weaknesses, and silencing Stelescu's claims that Codreanu was hypocritical in his official display of ascetism, politically corrupt, uncultured, and a plagiarist. In 1936, Codreanu published an essay entitled [...] "The Resurrection of the Race", where he wrote:"I will under underline this once again: we are not up against a few pathetic individuals who have landed here by chance and who now seek protection and shelter. We <b>are</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> a fully-fledged Jewish state, an entire army which has come here with its sights set on conquest. The movement of the Jewish population and its penetration into Romania are being carried out in accordance with precise plans. In all probability, the 'Great Jewish Council' is planning {{the creation of a new}} Palestine on a strip of land, starting out on the Baltic Sea, embraces a part of Poland and Czechoslovakia and half of Romania right across to the Black Sea...The worse thing that Jews and politicians have done to us, the greatest danger that they have exposed our people to, is not the way they are seizing the riches and possessions of our country, destroying the Romanian middle class, the way they swamp our schools and liberal professions, or the pernicious influence they are having on our whole political life, although these already constitute mortal dangers for a people. The greatest danger they pose to the people is rather that they are undermining us racially, that they are destroying the racial, Romano-Dacian structure of our people and call into being a type of human being that is nothing, but a racial wreck." [...] The year was also marked by the deaths and ostentatious funerals of Moța (by then, the movement's vice president) and Vasile Marin, who had volunteered on Francisco Franco's side in the Spanish Civil War and had been killed in the Majadahonda battle. Codreanu also published his autobiographical and ideological essay Pentru legionari ("For the Legionaries" [...] or [...] "For My Legionaries").|$|E
