Combining episodes written by Luther Murdock and <b>Aiken</b> Woodruff, Dalton: <b>Code</b> of Vengeance II found Dalton {{travelling}} first to Houston, Texas, to help friend Jeanne Bennett (played by Karen Landry) locate her husbandâ€”his former commanding officer, Major Monty Bennett (Donnelly Rhodes). [...] When he discovers that Major Bennett is now aiding the New Patriots, a conservative paramilitary group of Vietnam veterans bent on overthrowing the United States government, he sets off for the Florida Everglades to stop them. [...] The New Patriots' plan is to commit acts of domestic terrorism while framing an Arab group for the atrocities {{in the belief that}} this will allow them to seize control of the government they feel betrayed them in Vietnam. [...] Ultimately, Dalton confronts his former commander in the swamp and, after a long and unexplained flashback sequence of combat in Vietnam, Dalton stops both his commander and the group's plans.|$|R
