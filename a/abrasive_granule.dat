40|$|Abstract. The {{results of}} the {{research}} of {{the interaction of the}} <b>abrasive</b> <b>granule</b> with processed surface at vibroabrasive processing are presented. The mechanism of the micro cutting process is described on the base of the analysis of the nature of single traces of the processing, dynamic parameters of the process, geometric parameters of abrasive grains and granules...|$|E
40|$|A {{relationship}} permitting {{to determine}} the amount of metal to be removed {{from the surface of the}} job has been established for the first time; a mechanism defining the interaction between the <b>abrasive</b> <b>granule</b> and the surface of the job in the conditions of the vibration machining using a hinged-arm drive has been studied. Optimum relationships have been set for the surface roughness and the abrasive wear. Methods of determining the technological parameters of the process have been devised.

40|$|DE 10303741 A UPAB: 20040910 NOVELTY - A {{process for}} {{separating}} a longitudinal member, especially a polymer optical fibre, comprises cutting the member (2) using a separating tool (1) cutting edge, and then smoothing the separation surface. Separating and smoothing {{are carried out}} in a single step using the tool. A tool surface with <b>abrasive</b> <b>granules</b> (3) is used to smooth cut. The separation tool surface is smooth and is heated during separation. Heating is carried out using a radiation source (5), eg a light source. USE - The process is used to separate a longitudinal member, especially a polymer optical fibre. ADVANTAGE - The cut is smooth and minimizes optical losses...|$|R
50|$|Since the {{morphology}} of the hypsodont tooth is {{suited to}} a more abrasive diet, hypsodonty was thought to have evolved concurrently with the spread of grasslands. During the Cretaceous Period (145-66 million years ago), the Great Plains were covered by a shallow inland sea called the Western Interior Seaway which began to recede during the Late Cretaceous to the Paleocene (65-55 million years ago), leaving behind thick marine deposits and a relatively flat terrain. During the Miocene and Pliocene epochs (25 million years), the continental climate became favorable {{to the evolution of}} grasslands. Existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread. The grasslands provided a new niche for mammals, including many ungulates that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets. Grass contains silica-rich phytoliths (<b>abrasive</b> <b>granules),</b> which wear away dental tissue more quickly. So the spread of grasslands was linked to the development of high-crowned (hypsodont) teeth in grazers.|$|R
25|$|Non-slagging gasifiers produce dry ash {{similar to}} that {{produced}} by conventional coal combustion, which can be an environmental liability if the ash (typically containing heavy metals) is leachable or caustic, and if the ash must be stored in ash ponds. Slagging gasifiers, which are utilized at many of the major coal gasification applications worldwide, have considerable advantage in that ash components are fused into a glassy slag, capturing trace heavy metals in the non-leachable glassy matrix, rendering the material non-toxic. This non-hazardous slag has multiple beneficial uses such as aggregate in concrete, aggregate in asphalt for road construction, grit in <b>abrasive</b> blasting, roofing <b>granules,</b> etc.|$|R
