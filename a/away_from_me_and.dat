25|$|Astaire {{continued}} {{to act in}} the 1970s, appearing on television as the father of Robert Wagner's character, Alexander Mundy, in It Takes a Thief and in such films as The Towering Inferno (1974), in which he danced with Jennifer Jones and for which he received his only Academy Award nomination, in the category of Best Supporting Actor. He voiced the mailman narrator in the 1970s animated television specials Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town and The Easter Bunny Is Comin' to Town. Astaire also appeared in the first two That's Entertainment! documentaries, in the mid 1970s. In the second, aged seventy-six, he performed song-and-dance routines with Kelly, his last dance performances in a musical film. In the summer of 1975, he made three albums in London, Attitude Dancing, They Can't Take These <b>Away</b> <b>from</b> <b>Me,</b> <b>and</b> A Couple of Song and Dance Men, the last an album of duets with Bing Crosby. In 1976, Astaire played a supporting role, as a dog owner, in the cult movie The Amazing Dobermans, co-starring Barbara Eden and James Franciscus. Fred Astaire played Dr. Seamus Scully in the French film The Purple Taxi (1977).|$|E
500|$|Vonnegut did not {{particularly}} sympathize with liberalism or conservatism, and mused on the specious simplicity of American politics. [...] "If {{you want to}} take my guns <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> you're all for murdering fetuses, and love it when homosexuals marry each other [...] you're a liberal. If you are against those perversions and for the rich, you're a conservative. What could be simpler?" [...] Regarding political parties, Vonnegut said, [...] "The two real political parties in America are the Winners and the Losers. The people don’t acknowledge this. They claim membership in two imaginary parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, instead." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{conception}} of the album, Aguilera told MTV News that [...] "it is a new beginning, a re-introduction {{of myself as a}} new artist in a way, because for the first time people are really seeing and getting to know who I really am". She also revealed, [...] "Coming off of the height of being a part of such a big pop-craze phenomenon, that imagery of that cookie-cutter sweetheart, without it being me, I just had to take it all down and get it <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> that is why I actually named the album Stripped, because it is about being emotionally stripped down and pretty bare to open my soul and heart". [...] "Walk Away" [...] was written by Aguilera, Scott Storch and Matt Morris, with production handled by Storch.|$|E

500|$|..... And when Michel {{gets his}} strokes of genius and, {{in the video}} for [...] "Army of Me", wants a dentist that's a gorilla to find a diamond in my mouth, some people call it nonsense. But it's {{probably}} the most realistic way of expressing what situation I'm in - all these people trying to take things <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> the gorilla finding a diamond that I don't know I have and then stealing it. [...] "Army of Me" [...] is so much about me actually learning that I have to defend myself. I {{have to stand up}} and fight the fucking gorilla. Once I've got the diamond and I run away with it, it becomes massive 'cos it's mine. But if the gorilla had kept it, it would have gone really tiny. That's surrealism for me.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{learning}} of his mistress' arrest, Pasternak telephoned Liuisa Popova {{and asked her}} to come at once to Gogol Boulevard. She found him sitting on a bench near the Palace of Soviets Metro Station. Weeping, Pasternak told her, [...] "Everything is finished now. They've taken her <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I'll never see her again. It's like death, even worse." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Hosea {{referred}} to Israel’s worship of other gods as spiritual adultery: [...] “How I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts, which have turned <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> by their eyes, which have lusted after their idols.” [...] This {{led to a}} broken covenant between Yahweh and Israel and “divorce,” manifested as defeat by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon followed by exile, from which the northern kingdom never recovered.|$|E
2500|$|The prophetic books (Nevi’im) recount a {{continuing}} struggle against idolatry. For example, the biblical prophet Jeremiah complains: [...] "According {{to the number}} of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah."

2500|$|On {{his return}} to California, London {{was unable to find}} work and relied on odd jobs such as cutting grass. He {{submitted}} a query letter to the San Francisco Bulletin proposing a story about his Alaskan adventure, but the idea was rejected because, as the editor told him, [...] "Interest in Alaska has subsided in an amazing degree." [...] A few years later, London wrote a short story about a dog named Bâtard who, {{at the end of the}} story, kills his master. London sold the piece to Cosmopolitan Magazine, which published it in the June 1902 issue under the title [...] "Diablo— A Dog". London's biographer, Earle Labor, says that London then began work on The Call of the Wild to [...] "redeem the species" [...] from his dark characterization of dogs in [...] "Bâtard". Expecting to write a short story, London explains: [...] "I meant it to be a companion to my other dog story [...] "Bâtard"... but it got <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> instead of 4,000 words it ran 32,000 before I could call a halt." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her glance {{was again}} remote as she said: [...] "I cannot take that murder case seriously. It all seems a {{thousand}} miles <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> now. <b>And</b> yet I am afraid for daddy's sake. Why connect me with it? Is there no other woman to accuse? Do you suppose a woman did the shooting? I don't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us be {{a little}} society of three, and do what we can. I shall begin at home, and watch over brother Ned; for lately he has been growing <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> somehow, <b>and</b> I'm afraid he is {{beginning}} to be 'gay.' I shall get teased unmercifully; but I won't mind if I keep him safe." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} once, on deck, {{in bright}} day, touching {{him on the}} shoulder as preliminary to giving an order. His back was toward <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> at the first feel of my hand he leaped upright in the air <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> snarling <b>and</b> turning his head as he leaped. He had for the moment mistaken me for the man he hated.|$|R
2500|$|Once Dawn Doughnuts became {{profitable}} in late 1936, Smith {{wrote an}} 85-page outline for {{what became the}} four core Lensman novels; in early 1937, Tremaine committed to buying them. Segmenting the story into four novels required considerable effort to avoid dangling loose ends; Smith cites Edgar Rice Burroughs as a negative example. After the outline was complete, he wrote a more detailed outline of Galactic Patrol, plus a detailed graph of its structure, with [...] "peaks of emotional intensity and the valleys of characterization and background material." [...] He notes, however, that he {{was never able to}} follow any of his outlines at all closely, as the [...] "characters get <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> do exactly as they damn please." [...] After completing the rough draft of Galactic Patrol, he wrote the concluding chapter of the last book in the series, Children of the Lens. Galactic Patrol was published in the September 1937 through February 1938 issues of Astounding; unlike the revised book edition, it was not set in the same universe as Triplanetary.|$|E
60|$|She {{sank back}} upon the couch <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> {{began to laugh}} very softly.|$|E
60|$|She turned <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> {{answered}} {{the man on}} her left, who had just addressed her....|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why {{do you go}} <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> so often, <b>and</b> keep away?' asked Florence. 'And why do you {{sometimes}} look so strangely on me, dear Mama? You do so, do you not?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{first the}} earth seemed to slip <b>away</b> <b>from</b> under <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> time to stand still. Then I was myself again, and could listen {{steadily}} to all he said. It was only this,--I {{had been born}} with a strong nature in a feeble frame, had lived too fast, wasted health ignorantly, and was past help." ...|$|R
60|$|At once I {{realized}} that I {{was in a}} very awkward predicament. For, about twelve feet <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> John <b>and</b> Mary Cavendish were standing facing each other, and they were evidently quarrelling. And, quite as evidently, they were unaware of my vicinity, for before I could move or speak John repeated the words which had aroused <b>me</b> <b>from</b> my dream.|$|R
60|$|With {{those words}} he turned <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> began walking irritably {{up and down}} the room.|$|E
60|$|The moment I {{mentioned}} her father, she shrank <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> {{burst into}} a violent fit of crying.|$|E
60|$|He gently {{drew his}} hand <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> sighed {{as he did}} it. Perhaps she had {{sometimes}} kissed his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{he insisted}} that I should try Hilo out--myself, rather--at private rehearsal. He was a handful, a glorious handful. But not vicious, not malicious. He got <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> over <b>and</b> over again, but I never let him know. I was not afraid, <b>and</b> that helped <b>me</b> keep always a feel of him that {{prevented}} him from thinking that he was even a jump ahead of me.|$|R
6000|$|At length {{he said to}} her, [...] "I am a man to my word. I {{have kept}} my oath for twenty-one years; and now I can drink with a good conscience....If I don't do for him--well, I am a fearful {{practical}} joker when I choose! He has taken <b>away</b> everything <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> by heavens, if I meet him I won't answer for my deeds!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no,' {{she said}} desperately, 'I cannot, I {{will not give}} him up! Your ladyship took him <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> alive, <b>and</b> gave him back to me only when he was dead. Now I will keep him! I am truly his widow. More truly than you, my lady! for I love him and mourn for him, and call myself by his dear name, and your ladyship does neither!' ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, with a {{crashing}} in the bushes, the cub was hauled <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> then I saw Hiram at the rope.|$|E
60|$|It was my {{turn now}} to hold HER. She tried to break <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> get down first to the door.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not all, grandmother,' {{answered}} he; 'there {{are still}} some who keep <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> say that I have not fasted long enough.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! ah! old rogue," [...] {{repeated}} the insufferable Colonel, gnashing his ruined teeth at him, as if, for some incomprehensible reason, {{he wished to}} tear him to pieces and devour him. [...] "I know you. You are taking the life <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> villain! <b>and</b> I {{told you it was}} my inheritance. And I told you there was a Bloody Footstep, bearing its track down through my race.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is already}} done," [...] her visitor answered. [...] "To-morrow {{the world will}} know his guilt and my shame. Ah," [...] she cried, her voice {{suddenly}} changing, [...] "I had forgotten. Turn your face <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> Helen Thurwell, <b>and</b> listen." ...|$|R
60|$|And then, {{without a}} moment's warning, {{the fire of}} indignation which had leaped up to help me {{suddenly}} died out. He was standing respectfully <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> pale <b>and</b> dignified. His face was full of emotion, and his hands were trembling; but some instinct seemed to have told him how I hated his touch, {{and he did not}} attempt even to hold my hand. Oh! that moment, terrible as it was at the time, will be very sweet to think upon in after days.|$|R
