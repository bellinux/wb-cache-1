Personnel recruitment {{is the process}} of identifying qualified candidates in the workforce <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> to apply for jobs within an organization. Personnel recruitment processes include developing job announcements, placing ads, defining key qualifications for applicants, and screening out unqualified applicants.|$|E
25|$|In 1877–1878, the Romanian War of Independence (or more specifically, Romania's {{contribution}} to the Russo-Turkish War) {{opened the way for}} the country's evolution into a Kingdom of Romania (1880). Although independence occurred under a National Liberal mandate, Bonifaciu's cousin is widely credited with having helped modernize the Romanian Land Forces <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> battle-ready. Bonifaciu also contributed, on the humanitarian side, publishing the collection Quelques vers, which specified that it collected money au profit des blessés ("to help the wounded").|$|E
25|$|Rescue, {{and where}} necessary, resuscitation, should be started {{as early as}} {{possible}} for best results. If conscious, the person should be taken out of the water as soon as possible. In-water resuscitation may increase the chances of a favourable result by a factor of about three, if there will be any delay in getting the person out of the water, but the necessary skills require training. Only rescue ventilation is practicable in the water, chest compressions require a suitable platform, so in-water assessment of circulation is pointless. If the person does not respond after a few breaths, cardiac arrest may be assumed, <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> out of the water becomes the priority.|$|E

25|$|Well {{aware of}} the dangers posed by German armor, Barnes was {{instrumental}} in getting the 90 mm gun in the M36 tank destroyer <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> shipped to Europe over the opposition of the Army Ground Forces, which believed that the 75 and 76 mm guns were adequate. However, he did not approve {{of the idea of}} mounting a 90 mm in the Sherman; rather, he sought to develop a better tank. The T20 Medium Tank, developed in May 1942, was faster, with more armor and a lower silhouette than the Sherman. Further development work led to the T23, which incorporated an electrical transmission. The electrical transmission made the tank easier to operate, but at a cost in weight and maintenance, and was therefore rejected by the Army Ground Forces. He therefore reverted to conventional transmissions for the improved T25 and T26 models, mounting the 90 mm gun, which would eventually become the M26 Pershing.|$|E
25|$|Heat stroke {{can occur}} in dogs, {{especially}} in flat-faced breeds such as the Bulldog or in giant breeds. Breed, lack of water, exercise, and high ambient temperature predispose dogs to heat stroke. Signs include vomiting, diarrhea, collapse, difficulty breathing, and body temperature approaching 42°C to 43°C. Treatment includes cooling the dogs with wet towels and fans, intravenous fluid therapy, and other supportive care. If a dog's temperature begin to drop to around 40°C, stop the cooling process. Once a dog’s body begins to cool, it can drop quickly <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> too cool can create different problems. Allow the dog {{only a couple of}} laps of water until their temperature begins to drop to a more normal level. Do not allow a dog to gulp large quantities of water. If a dog is panting excessively and then drinks a lot of water, he will swallow large amounts of air with the water and this can cause an equally life-threatening case of gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat) in their stomach.|$|E
25|$|The seven person crew of STS-131 {{was awakened}} {{to begin their}} first full day in space on Flight Day 2. Due {{to the lack of}} Ku-band communication, changes to the crews daily plan were read up for them to write out. After their post sleep activities, {{commander}} Alan Poindexter and pilot Jim Dutton fired Discoverys Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines to correct and further refine the shuttle's path to the ISS. Astronauts Naoko Yamazaki and Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger began activating and checking out the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) also known as the Canadarm. While Metcalf-Lindenburger and Yamazaki were working with Canadarm, Stephanie Wilson was getting equipment together and set up to record the inspections of the shuttle's heat shield. The inspections were recorded so they could be downlinked to the ground once docked to the ISS. Once all that work was done, commander Poindexter and pilot Dutton joined Metcalf-Lindenburger, Yamazaki, and Wilson to conduct the inspection of the shuttle's heat shield. While the inspection was going on, Rick Mastracchio and Clayton Anderson were on the mid-deck of Discovery checking out the Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> ready for their three spacewalks. The last portion of the crew day was spent preparing and checking out all of the tools used during rendezvous.|$|E

500|$|Herman Cyril McNeile, MC (28 September 1888 – 14 August 1937), {{commonly}} known as Cyril McNeile and publishing under the name H. C. McNeile or the pseudonym Sapper, was a British soldier and author. Drawing on his experiences in the trenches during the First World War, he started writing short stories <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> published in the Daily Mail.

500|$|In March 1989, the Chili Peppers {{embarked}} on a two-month tour to break-in the new lineup. The [...] "Positive Mental Octopus tour" [...] saw the band play small venues throughout the United States, including several concerts on the East and West Coast. During this period, Frusciante began to assert more energy and his ego [...] "got a little swollen", according to Flea, [...] "He was running around being rude to girls <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> pissed off.

[...] Another incident, following a performance at the George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, caused legal repercussions; a student accused Kiedis of engaging in sexual misconduct and indecent exposure. The vocalist was subsequently arrested and released on bail pending a trial that was to be set for a later date.|$|E
500|$|Another {{topic in}} current RMS {{research}} pertains to pharmaceuticals. [...] Scientists {{are still trying}} to tackle the difficult task of administering drugs into the brain <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> past the selective blood–brain barrier. [...] In a recent study, researchers tested the role of the RMS in “intranasal delivery of drugs into the CNS”. [...] In this study, the experimenters disrupted the RMS in mice, which obstructed “the uptake of intranasally administered radioligands into the CNS.” [...] Fluorescent tracers were also used to track the medicine throughout the brain. [...] It was found that the medicine spread to all regions of the brain, including the olfactory bulb. [...] The study concluded that the RMS was extremely prevalent and necessary in the central nervous system in order to deliver drugs intranasally. [...] The study also noted that this research on the RMS is not sufficient, but instead needs to be expanded. [...] Some of the limits and capabilities of the RMS are still unknown, {{as well as some of}} the hazards of it. [...] If drugs are to be administered into the CNS through the RMS, all of the details of the RMS must be known in order to ensure safe delivery of the drugs to the brain.|$|E

2500|$|However, Smith's {{personal}} {{desire to}} make money began to get linked with his political desires. Already it had been spotted that Smith's painting and decorating firm received {{more than half of}} the contracts for council housing. In 1962 he established a public relations firm to support redevelopment of other urban centres in the north-east, and later nationwide. This company formed links with John Poulson, an architect keen for the business and known for paying those who could supply it. Smith eventually received £156,000 from Poulson for his work, which typically involved signing up local councillors on to the payroll of his companies <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> to push their councils to accept Poulson's prepackaged redevelopment schemes.

The group included then bassist Tom Strasman and Chilean-born vocalist and guitarist Alain Johannes. With Strasman set on becoming a lawyer, he quit the band to keep his grades up and focus on college. At this point, Flea was brought into the mix. Shortly after hanging out with the band, and attending a few shows, Kiedis was offered a position in the band by Flea.

They said the results had been confirmed dozens of times and they had no doubts about them. In the accompanying press release Fleischmann was quoted saying: [...] "What we have done is to open the door of a new research area, our indications are that the discovery will be relatively easy to make into a usable technology for generating heat and power, but continued work is needed, first, to further understand the science and secondly, to determine its value to energy economics." ...|$|E
