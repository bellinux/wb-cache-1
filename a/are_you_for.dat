2500|$|The {{questionnaire}} to 200 writers asked the following question: [...] "Are you for, or against, the legal government {{and people of}} Republican Spain? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>for,</b> or against, Franco and Fascism? For it is impossible any longer to take no side." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The time {{is coming}} when justice will be laid {{to the line}} and righteousness to the plummet; when we shall take the old broadsword and ask, <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> God? And {{if you are not}} heartily on the Lord's side, you will be hewn down." ...|$|E
6000|$|I say to them, What else <b>are</b> <b>you</b> made <b>for?</b> It shuts them up. They haven't {{a word to}} answer. What else <b>are</b> <b>you</b> made <b>for?</b> That clinches it.' ...|$|R

2500|$|I {{was brought}} {{straight}} to the blocks. Cell 17, D wing H1 or 2. I was stripped and beaten. The screws who knew me said, 'We are the bosses now. There are no OCs here'. A screw said to me, 'What size {{are you in the}} waist and what size <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> shoes?' I asked him 'What for?' and he told me 'For a uniform'. I said, 'You have got to be joking'. I {{was the only one in}} the H-Blocks. They dragged me into the cell. Davy Long [...] wanted me to compromise. He suggested I wore my own shoes and trousers if I wore a prison shirt. I just laughed. He locked the door. I lay on the floor all night without mattress, blankets or anything else. The heat was reasonable in all fairness and I slept.|$|E

"She is right, nevertheless, Rosy, and so <b>are</b> <b>you,</b> <b>for</b> the {{two things}} go together, and in helping seven lads you are unconsciously doing much to improve one lass," [...] said Dr. Alec, {{stopping}} to nod and smile at the bright-faced figure resting on the old bamboo chair, after a lively game of battledore and shuttlecock, {{in place of a}} run which a storm prevented.|$|E

"I may grant all this," [...] said Bridgenorth; [...] "but {{what the}} better <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> my good opinion, {{or for the}} ease with which I can forgive you the injury which you aimed at me? You are in my custody as a magistrate, accused of abetting the foul, bloody, and heathenish plot, for the {{establishment}} of Popery, the murder of the King, and the general massacre of all true Protestants." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Grizel!" [...] she echoed. [...] "You are {{not angry}} with me, <b>are</b> <b>you,</b> <b>for</b> being almost sorry for her? She {{used to be}} so different. 'Where is your independence, Grizel?' I say to her, and she shakes her sorrowful head. The little girl I used to be need not look for me any more; if we were to meet in the Den she would not know me now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “What? <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> a walk, Bess?” {{cried the}} Judge, {{suspending}} his movements {{for a moment}} to smile, with a father’s fondness, at the display of womanly grace and beauty that his child presented. “Remember the heats of July, my daughter; nor venture further than thou canst retrace before the meridian. Where is thy parasol, girl? thou wilt lose tine polish of that brow, under this sun and southern breeze, unless thou guard it with unusual care.” ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{know that}} you women love to pray with me, but praying in your inner rooms <b>is</b> better <b>for</b> <b>you</b> than praying in your house, and praying in your house <b>is</b> better <b>for</b> <b>you</b> that praying in your {{courtyard}}, and praying in your courtyard <b>is</b> better <b>for</b> <b>you</b> than praying in your local mosque, and praying in your local mosque <b>is</b> better <b>for</b> <b>you</b> than praying in my mosque.|$|R

The doctor {{says that the}} Dutchman's sword has cleft right through your shoulder-bone. 'Tis well that it is your left, for {{it may be that}} you will never have its full use again.

"My dear lady," [...] he {{answered}} her look, [...] "this very imprudent young man {{seems to have}} burnt his boats, and no doubt recks very little if, in that heroical conflagration, he burns our fingers. Speaking, however, as your family adviser"--and he laid enough stress on it {{to convince me that}} there was no love lost between him and the interloping Chevenix--"I suggest that we gain nothing by protracting this scene {{in the face of a}} crowded assembly. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> the card-room, madam?" ...|$|E
60|$|There {{are those}} who are {{dissatisfied}} with me. To such I would say: You desire peace, and you blame me {{that we do not have}} it. But how can we attain it? There are but three conceivable ways. First, to suppress the rebellion by force of arms. This I am trying to do. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> it? If you are, so far we are agreed. If you are not for it, a second way is to give up the Union. I am against this. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> it? If you are, you should say so plainly. If you are not for force, nor yet for dissolution, there only remains some imaginable compromise. I do not believe any compromise embracing the maintenance of the Union is now possible. All I learn leads to a directly opposite belief. The strength of the rebellion is its military, its army. That army dominates all the country and all the people within its range. Any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range, in opposition to that army, is simply nothing for the present, because such man or men have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise, if one were made with them.|$|E

6000|$|Arrived at Transham, {{that little}} town upon a hill which the Morton Plough Works had created, they were soon in Stanley's car, {{whirling}} into the sleepy peace of a Worcestershire afternoon. Would this young bird nestling {{up against him}} echo Flora's verdict: 'I feel all body there!' or would she take to its fatted luxury as a duck to water? And he said: [...] "By the way, your aunt's 'Bigwigs' set in on a Saturday. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> staying and seeing the lions feed, or do we cut back?" ...|$|E
60|$|Ethel. Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> ever harping about Lord Farintosh and his titles? I {{thought it}} was only women who were jealous--you gentlemen say so.--(Hurriedly.) I am going to-night with grandmamma to the Minister of the Interior, {{and then to the}} Russian ball; and to-morrow to the Tuileries. We dine at the Embassy first; and on Sunday, I suppose, we shall go to the Rue d'Aguesseau. I can hardly come here before Mon---. Madam de Florac! Little Leonore is very like you--resembles you very much. My cousin says he longs to make a drawing of her.|$|E

6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] {{answered}} my friend, rising from his chair. [...] "I'll let you know, and Mr. Melas also.
