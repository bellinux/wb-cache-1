Being a strong Catholic himself, he was aligned with the Catholic perspective that rejected mixed-sex education, in contrast with Protestantism.|$|E

Afterward, he moved to Jackson, Mississippi where he began his legal career. From 1838 to 1839, he served <b>as</b> <b>Reading</b> Clerk for the Mississippi state senate.|$|E
5|$|People {{who engage}} in {{intellectual}} activities such <b>as</b> <b>reading,</b> playing board games, completing crossword puzzles, playing musical instruments, or regular social interaction show a reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease. This {{is compatible with the}} cognitive reserve theory, which states that some life experiences result in more efficient neural functioning providing the individual a cognitive reserve that delays the onset of dementia manifestations. Education delays the onset of AD syndrome without changing the duration of the disease. Learning a second language even later in life seems to delay getting Alzheimer disease.|$|E

Diplomats Theodor von Sickel and Carlrichard Brühl believe that the document is not the original as it lacks a seal and the lines are unusually shaped.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>Reading</b> has grown, its suburbs have spread: to {{the west}} between the two rivers into {{the foothills of the}} Berkshire Downs as far as Calcot, Tilehurst and Purley; to the south and {{south-east}} {{on the south side of}} the Kennet as far as Whitley Wood, Lower Earley and Woodley; and to the north of the Thames into the Chiltern Hills as far as Caversham Heights, Emmer Green and Caversham Park Village. Outside the central area, the floors of the valleys containing the two rivers remain largely unimproved floodplain. Apart from the M4 curving to the south there is only one road across the Kennet floodplain. All other routes between the three built-up areas are in the central area, which is a cause of road congestion there.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{was not an}} {{especially}} pious king by medieval standards. In England, he provided steady patronage to the monastic houses, but established few new monasteries and was relatively conservative in determining which he did support, favouring those with established links to his family, such <b>as</b> <b>Reading</b> Abbey. In this regard Henry's religious tastes {{appear to have been}} influenced by his mother, and indeed before his ascension a number of religious charters were issued in their joint names. Henry did found a number of religious hospitals in England and France. After the death of Becket, Henry built and endowed various monasteries in France, primarily to improve his popular image. Since travel by sea during the period was dangerous, he would also take full confession before setting sail and use auguries to determine the best time to travel. Henry's movements may also have been planned to take advantage of saints' days and other fortuitous occasions.|$|E
5|$|Internally, {{the ground}} floor of the west wing housed the dining room, service areas and led through to the kitchen and bakehouse. The service area was fitted with a {{mezzanine}} floor to provide sleeping facilities for male servants; the sleeping quarters for female servants were {{on the top floor of}} the mansion to keep the two sexes a good distance away from each other. On the same level, the east wing had a study with ante-room set in the northwest corner, a boudoir, two drawing rooms and a billiard room. An expansive library, divided into sections by pillars, was between the boudoir and study, beside the large bay window. The first floor, accessed via the main staircase positioned within the entrance hall, had all the family bedrooms, and featured balconies. Hip baths were carried to the bedrooms each evening as no bathrooms were incorporated. Cubitt had furniture workshops in London where the majority of the mansion's furnishings and fittings were crafted from mahogany. Nurseries were on the top floor beside the female servant accommodation. Around thirty rooms made up the basement, among them a smoking room where editions of Punch and The Illustrated London News were supplied <b>as</b> <b>reading</b> material. The remaining rooms on the basement level were workshops, wine cellars and individual parlours for the butler, housekeeper and other principal servants, together with general storerooms.|$|E
