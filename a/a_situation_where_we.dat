In 1995, USC was in negotiations to hire Amaker to replace interim coach Charlie Parker, who replaced George Raveling following a car accident. The reason his negotiations with USC failed was compensation since Amaker was both a Duke assistant coach and earned an additional $100,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) through a summer youth day camp. That summer, Duke promoted Amaker from assistant basketball coach to associate head coach. Krzyzewski returned to coaching in October 1995. USC went on to hire Parker, who did not last a full season as head coach. In 1996, Amaker was rumored to be on the short list to replace interim coach Steve Lavin at UCLA in 1997. When the Northwestern job opened up again in 1997, he was not under consideration because athletic director Rick Taylor sought a candidate with Division I head coaching postseason experience.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDickert (1988) {{settled a}} {{well-known}} conjecture on unambiguous liftings to words of Möbius functions for free partially commutative monoids.

This question has been reconsidered by König (1992) and a conjecture has been formulated there. Our results solve the open problem and settle this conjecture (Remark 4. 8). We show that there is a canonical one-to-one correspondence between unambiguous Möbius functions and confluent semi-commutation systems (Theorem 5. 1). This identification is due to some graph-theoretic characterizationobtained by Diekert (1991) and which allows one to apply some interesting complexity results (Section 6).
