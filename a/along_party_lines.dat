5|$|Following {{a lengthy}} discussion, {{the vote on}} Thorne-Begland's {{nomination}} was held shortly after 1 am on May 15.

Following the vote, the House of Delegates adjourned for the year.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Commission {{began its}} {{work and the}} {{proceedings}} were followed closely and eagerly debated by the public. As Playford did not commute Stuart's sentence, Dunstan introduced a bill to abolish capital punishment. The vote was split <b>along</b> <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> and was thus defeated, but Dunstan used the opportunity to attack the Playmander with much effect in the media, portraying the failed legislation as an unjust triumph of a malapportioned minority who had a vengeance mentality over an electorally repressed majority who wanted a humane outcome.|$|E

5|$|The committee's {{investigation}} {{lasted from}} May 1911 to April 1912. At its conclusion, the committee split <b>along</b> <b>party</b> <b>lines.</b> Stanley authored the majority report which condemned alleged price fixing by U.S. Steel and censured President Theodore Roosevelt {{for his role}} in U.S. Steel's purchase of the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company. The minority report, authored by Republican Augustus P. Gardner, absolved Roosevelt and downplayed the price fixing charges. Stanley's report also recommended a number of changes to strengthen the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Though his recommendations were not enacted into law during his time in the House, many of them were eventually included in the Clayton Antitrust Act.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Fraser's accession, {{controversy}} arose {{over the}} Whitlam government's actions {{in trying to}} restart peace talks in Vietnam. As the North prepared to end the civil war, Whitlam sent cables to both Vietnamese governments, telling Parliament that both cables were substantially the same. The Opposition contended he had misled Parliament, and a motion to censure Whitlam was defeated <b>along</b> <b>party</b> <b>lines.</b> The Opposition also attacked Whitlam for not allowing enough South Vietnamese refugees into Australia, with Fraser calling for the entry of 50,000. Freudenberg alleges that 1,026Vietnamese refugees entered Australia in the final eight months of the Whitlam government, and only 399 in 1976 under Fraser. However, by 1977, Australia had accepted over five thousand refugees.|$|E
5|$|The Senate later acquitted Clinton on both charges. The Senate {{refused to}} meet to hold an {{impeachment}} trial {{before the end of}} the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams & Connolly. The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge. Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally <b>along</b> <b>party</b> <b>lines,</b> with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.|$|E
5000|$|In the 109th Congress, Walsh voted <b>along</b> Republican <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> for 84% of his votes. [...] In the 110th Congress, Walsh's votes {{placed him}} as a centrist between Democrats and Republicans.|$|R
50|$|The Yukon Legislative Assembly is {{the only}} {{legislature}} in Canada's territories which is organized <b>along</b> political <b>party</b> <b>lines.</b> In Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, the legislative assemblies are instead elected on a non-partisan consensus government model.|$|R
40|$|This article {{summarizes}} {{research on}} the analysis of roll call votes in the European Parliament since the European Parliament was elected by universal suffrage and draws lessons about legislative behavior in the European Parliament. The research shows that voting in the European Parliament occurs <b>along</b> supranational <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> and not <b>along</b> geographical <b>lines.</b> <b>Party</b> cohesion has increased with {{the powers of the}} European Parliament. This increased cohesion is the reflection of European party discipline based on cohesion of national party groups. Moreover, coalition frequency is related mostly to ideological closeness between party groups. (JEL codes: D 72, F 53, P 16) Copyright, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
5|$|The most {{politically}} charged issue in Kentucky during Breckinridge's campaign, however, was the Old Court-New Court controversy. The Panic of 1819 had left many Kentuckians in dire financial straits. Legislators sought to relieve {{some of the}} financial burden by passing a law of replevin which favored debtors. The Kentucky Court of Appeals, (the highest court in the Commonwealth at the time,) declared the law unconstitutional. The next year, an incensed General Assembly passed legislation that dissolved the court {{and replaced it with}} a new court. Neither court acknowledged the other as valid, and a confused public lost respect for public authority in general. The issue was generally split <b>along</b> <b>party</b> <b>lines,</b> with Democrats generally favoring the New Court and Whigs favoring the Old Court.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{version of}} the bill passed the House largely <b>along</b> <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> in December by a vote of 223–202, and passed the Senate with {{amendments}} in May 2010 with a vote of 59–39 again largely <b>along</b> <b>party</b> <b>lines.</b> The bill then moved to conference committee, where the Senate bill was used as the base text although a few House provisions were included in the bill's base text.|$|E

50|$|The {{political}} system in Nunavut is not organized <b>along</b> political <b>party</b> <b>lines,</b> but instead uses a consensus government model in which the Executive Council of Nunavut is selected {{by the members of}} the Legislative Assembly at the Nunavut Leadership Forum. At the 2008 forum, held on November 14, 2008, Eva Aariak was selected as the new Premier of Nunavut.|$|R
50|$|The {{court at}} that time had four Democrats and one Republican. The court {{ruled in favor of}} the {{governor}} in a 4-1 decision, <b>along</b> straight <b>party</b> <b>lines.</b> It decided that the governor is in fact {{the chief executive of the}} state, and the legislature could not revoke his powers or delegate them if they were expressly granted to him in the state constitution.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his first}} year in Congress, Congressional Quarterly {{reported}} that Quinn's voting record was 84-85% Republican in support of the <b>party</b> <b>line.</b> [...] During {{his first year}}, while there were issues that he voted in favor of, there were also those that he voted against, including a $16 million community development stimulus package for Buffalo. [...] The Buffalo News reported that Quinn's consistency in voting <b>along</b> Republican <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> was reflected in 87% of his votes by 2001.|$|R
25|$|During the 2007 {{legislative}} session, Renfroe fulfilled {{a campaign}} promise to sponsor legislation banning almost all abortions and redefining pregnancy in state law {{to begin at}} conception. After intense lobbying by both pro-life and pro-choice groups, the measure was defeated <b>along</b> <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> in the Senate Judiciary Committee.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Bono {{was added}} to the House Judiciary Committee by the Republican {{leadership}} in anticipation of the consideration of impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, thus becoming the only Republican woman on the committee. Bono voted <b>along</b> <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> on all four motions for impeachment in both the committee and on the House floor, despite other moderate Republican House members voting against Articles II, III, and IV.|$|E
25|$|John Doolittle {{voted against}} the first House bill, which passed <b>along</b> <b>party</b> <b>lines.</b> It would have added $47 {{billion over five years}} to the $25 billion cost of the program and added about 5 million people to the program, {{including}} children, some legal immigrants, pregnant women, and adults aged 18 and 19. The bill was to be financed mainly by an increase in cigarette taxes.|$|E
50|$|Thomas Sampson (c. 1517 - 1589) was an English Puritan theologian. A Marian exile, {{he was one}} of the Geneva Bible translators. On {{his return}} to England, he had trouble with {{conformity}} to the Anglican practices.

50|$|On March 5, 2004, Senate Concurrent Resolution 95, {{sponsored}} by Senator Don Nickles, {{was introduced in}} the Senate. Debate occurred in the Senate from March 8 to 12 and the Senate adopted an amended resolution shortly after 1 a.m. Friday March 12, 2004 with a vote of 51 to 45 <b>along</b> strict <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> except for Zell Miller, Democrat of Georgia, voting Yea. The resolution was then sent to the House.|$|R
25|$|According to Gallup, {{the overall}} {{popularity}} of the law fell and then improved during Obama's tenure, but more disapproved of it (52%) than approved of it (44%) as of November 2016. Popularity was divided <b>along</b> <b>party</b> <b>lines,</b> with Democrats having a much more favorable view of the law. Individual elements were considerably more popular than the law overall, although the mandate requiring people to have insurance remained highly unpopular.|$|E
25|$|Woolf {{was elected}} to the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories in the 1902 election, {{defeating}} Heber Simeon Allen in the district of Cardston. He served in this capacity until 1905, when the new province of Alberta was created out of part of the Northwest Territories. Though in keeping with territorial custom Woolf had served as an independent in the territorial legislature, federally he was a Liberal, and in the debate over whether Alberta's politics should be conducted on an independent basis or <b>along</b> <b>party</b> <b>lines,</b> he was a strong advocate of the latter option.|$|E
25|$|In July 2009, Smith {{requested}} {{a meeting with}} the head of the Justice Department's Voting Rights Section in order to discuss whether political appointees had been involved in the decision to narrow the case, stating that news reports contradicted the Justice Department's earlier claim that political appointees had not been involved, and that earlier congressional inquiries about this had been unsuccessful. Smith and Wolf also requested that the voter intimidation charges which had been previously been dropped be refiled. In January 2010, after several unsuccessful attempts at obtaining the requested information from the department, Wolf sought a resolution of inquiry that would have forced the Justice Department to provide Congress with the details of why it narrowed the case. In a vote <b>along</b> <b>party</b> <b>lines,</b> the resolution was defeated 15-14.|$|E
50|$|The {{outcome of}} voting under STV is {{proportional}} {{within a single}} election to the collective preference of voters, assuming voters have ranked their real preferences and vote <b>along</b> strict <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> (assuming <b>parties</b> and no individual independents participate in the election). However, due to other voting mechanisms usually {{used in conjunction with}} STV, such as a district or constituency system, an election using STV may not guarantee proportionality across all districts put together.|$|R
5000|$|Civil unions {{were only}} {{available}} to same-sex couples in New Hampshire. On April 4, 2007, the NH House passed a civil unions bill HB437 with {{a vote of}} 243 to 129 which, if the bill were made law, would imbue partners in same-sex civil unions with the same [...] "rights, responsibilities and obligations" [...] as heterosexual couples in marriages. On April 26, 2007, the NH State Senate approved the civil unions bill 14-10 <b>along</b> political <b>party</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{military}} establishment was initially unenthusiastic about the CPTP concept, quite unimpressed by any program initiated and administered by civilians. Congress, too, was split <b>along</b> mostly <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> {{as to the}} value of the CPTP. Isolationists branded the program as provocative saber-rattling that threatened the nation's neutrality; others slammed it as a pork barrel waste of tax dollars, while supporters touted the positive impacts on the aviation industry and the defense value of a vastly enlarged base of trained pilots.|$|R
25|$|The U.S. House of Representatives had {{the right}} to make the final {{determination}} as to whether Buchanan will hold the seat {{for the remainder of the}} term or be replaced by Jennings. In April, a three-person House task force was created to evaluate the election. In early May, the task force voted <b>along</b> <b>party</b> <b>lines</b> to refer an investigation into Florida’s 13th district House race to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). On 25 February 2008, the committee and the House accepted the GAO's findings that no machine error was demonstrated as sufficient to have altered the outcome of the election. The House passed HR 989 affirming the findings of the committee, accepting the results of the 2006 race and formally dismissing Jennings' challenge of the election's results. Jennings formally dropped her challenge shortly thereafter to focus on her 2008 rematch against Buchanan.|$|E
500|$|Other {{legislation}} passed during Gerry's second year included a bill broadening {{the membership of}} Harvard's Board of Overseers to diversify its religious membership, and another that liberalized religious taxes. [...] The Harvard bill had significant political slant because the recent split between orthodox Congregationalists and Unitarians also divided the state to some extent <b>along</b> <b>party</b> <b>lines,</b> and Federalist Unitarians had recently gained control over the Harvard board.|$|E
500|$|Politicians {{generally}} reacted <b>along</b> <b>party</b> <b>lines,</b> with Senator Mundt stating, [...] "Nixon's {{speech is}} complete vindication {{against one of}} the most vicious smears in American history."
