5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form along linear {{bands of}} temperature/dewpoint gradient with significant vertical wind shear, {{and are thus}} classified as baroclinic cyclones. Initially, cyclogenesis, or low pressure formation, occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the upper level jetstream known as a jet streak. The favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants, where divergence ensues. The divergence causes air to rush out {{from the top of}} the air column. As mass in the column is reduced, atmospheric pressure at surface level (the weight of the air column) is reduced. The lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone (a low pressure system). The lowered pressure acts to draw in air, creating convergence in the low-level wind field. Low-level convergence and upper-level divergence imply upward motion within the column, making cyclones tend to be cloudy. As the cyclone strengthens, the cold front sweeps towards the equator and moves <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the cyclone. Meanwhile, its associated warm front progresses more slowly, as the cooler air ahead of the system is denser, and therefore more difficult to dislodge. Later, the cyclones occlude as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the warm front, forcing a tongue, or trowal, of warm air aloft. Eventually, the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken.|$|E
5|$|In each of {{his first}} two seasons, Hextall {{accumulated}} 104penalty minutes during the regular season, {{the first time that}} a goaltender had collected over 100. In the 1988–89 season, he broke his own record, being assessed 113penalty minutes, the most by any goaltender in an NHL season (as of 2015). Hextall completed the 1988–89 regular season with 30wins, the third consecutive season in which he had recorded so many, and the first time a goaltender had recorded 30wins in each of their first three seasons in the NHL. The Flyers finished fourth in the Patrick Division and qualified for the playoffs. They faced the Washington Capitals in the first round, and the teams shared the first four games. The Flyers won the fifth, despite being 5–4 down in the third period. Flyers' defenceman Mark Howe credited their victory to Hextall. Late in the game, the Capitals pulled their goaltender, and Hextall scored the second goal of his career. The puck was shot into the Flyers' left defensive zone by Scott Stevens, and Hextall went <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> his net, controlled the puck and shot at goal. He became the first goaltender to score a goal in the NHL playoffs. The Flyers won 8–5, and went on to win the series 4–2, which Joe Sexton of The New York Times attributed primarily to Hextall's return to form.|$|E

25|$|The {{performance}} finally improved but {{the result}} stayed the same when Middlesbrough went to Old Trafford, where Matthew Bates started a Middlesbrough game {{for the first time}} since the end of the 2005–06 season. Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson had spoken before the game, hoping to banish the rift that existed between the two clubs. Things probably weren't helped when Pogatetz, defending a corner, put his hands <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> Cristiano Ronaldo's neck a corner and the United player went down, claiming a penalty. The spat continued when the players walked off the pitch for half time. Dimitar Berbatov's goal was the decisive moment in the game when he fired home to give his side a 1–0 victory, and left Middlesbrough hovering above the relegation zone on goal difference and without a win in eight games.|$|E

25|$|The {{entrance}} is {{situated at the}} back of the Saw Plaza. The exterior queue line consists of mock razor wire fences and various large torture implements rusting on the ground (most of which come from the films). Walkie talkie announcements are heard from policemen inside the building, often sounding as if they are panicking. Loud ambient music is played throughout the area. The queue travels <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the warehouse and then into the building itself. Inside, riders walk through a dimly lit corridor, with four shotguns hanging from the ceiling. The guns 'fire' every few minutes to give a jump effect. The corridor leads up some stairs past a cage with a trap (the Rack from Saw III) seen in it. On special occasions, live actors are placed in this cage and act as Jigsaw's victims. Travelling up the stairs, Billy the Puppet can be seen and heard on TV monitors up the stairs to the station. Above the queue, a body is seen tangled in barbed wire (referencing the first Saw), before the queue goes into the station. In here, mannequin parts are fixed in various small devices or hanging from the walls, and misted windows flash on the wall opposite the queue.|$|E
25|$|On another note several {{athletic}} {{facilities are}} being renovated, {{and the new}} $8 million academic center will be located beneath the Norton Terrace {{at the south end}} of Papa John's Cardinal Stadium. It will be centrally located between two of the university's cornerstone buildings, the Swain Student Activities Center and Papa John's Cardinal Stadium. It will have seating capacity for over 5,300 fans and will feature a 15,500 square foot training center that will include identical locker rooms for each team, coaches' offices and a sports medicine training room. This stadium will be the second largest project the athletic department has undertaken behind Papa John's Cardinal Stadium. Furthermore, a $4 million expansion of Jim Patterson Stadium includes the addition of 1,500 chair back seats, two-tiered ground level terraces, a visiting team locker room, and a 6,400 square foot terrace atop the chair back seats connecting the first and third base sides. The new Jim Patterson Stadium will have a total capacity of 5,000. Along with the $2.75 million expansion of U of L's softball stadium will feature a team clubhouse with a locker room, a video room, and a players' lounge. The Dan Ulmer Stadium will see the addition of 200 chair back seats, bringing the seating capacity to 1,000.

25|$|The first {{points of}} the match came from a penalty in the ninth minute. Brisbane's Shaun Berrigan, playing at hooker, tried to burrow over the Storm's try-line from dummy half but was ruled {{to have had the}} ball taken from his arms by Billy Slater in a two-man tackle. The {{resulting}} penalty kick by captain Darren Lockyer in front of the posts was a gift two points for the Broncos to take an early 2-0 lead. Three minutes later, Melbourne halfback Cooper Cronk kicked a 40/20 coming out of his side's territory. Following the subsequent scrum in an attacking position, the Storm raided Brisbane's line and got the first try of the match. Scott Hill did well to evade a few attempted tackles and shoot a remarkable pass <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a Broncos defender and into the arms of winger Steve Turner who dived over out wide. Cameron Smith missed the conversion, leaving the score at 4-2. Brisbane then got a scrum of their own close to Melbourne's line after Turner knocked on trying to take a Lockyer bomb. Lockyer, moving across-field fed the ball back inside to Justin Hodges who went over untouched to put the ball down near the posts, affording the Broncos captain another easy kick.No more points were scored {{in the first half and}} Brisbane went into the break with an 8-4 lead. Darren Lockyer was limping around in the dressing room but went on to play through the rest of the game.|$|E
