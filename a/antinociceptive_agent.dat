40|$|SummaryOpioid drugs, such as morphine, {{are among}} the most {{effective}} analgesics available. However, their utility for the treatment of chronic pain is limited by side effects including tolerance and dependence. Morphine acts primarily through the mu-opioid receptor (MOP-R) [1], which is also a target of endogenous opioids. However, unlike endogenous ligands, morphine fails to promote substantial receptor endocytosis both in vitro [2 – 5] and in vivo [6 – 11]. Receptor endocytosis serves at least two important functions in signal transduction. First, desensitization and endocytosis act as an “off” switch by uncoupling receptors from G protein. Second, endocytosis functions as an “on” switch, resensitizing receptors by recycling them to the plasma membrane. Thus, both the off and on function of the MOP-R are altered in response to morphine compared to endogenous ligands. To examine whether the low degree of endocytosis induced by morphine contributes to tolerance and dependence, we generated a knockin mouse that expresses a mutant MOP-R that undergoes morphine-induced endocytosis. Morphine remains an excellent <b>antinociceptive</b> <b>agent</b> in these mice. Importantly, these mice display substantially reduced antinociceptive tolerance and physical dependence.

A hybrid of two PQ urea 2 showed a strong antimalarial activity, confirming the previous findings of the high activity of bis(8 -aminoquinolines) and other bisantimalarial drugs.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} functions of the opioid system is the control of pain. Among the three main opioid receptor classes (μ, δ, κ), the μ (MOR) is the main type targeted for pharmacotherapy of pain. Opioid analgesics such as morphine, oxycodone and fentanyl are agonists at the MOR and are the mainstay for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pain. However, adverse effects related to opioid use are severe and often lead to early discontinuation and inadequate analgesia. The development of more effective and safer medications for the management of pain still remains a major direction in pharmaceutical research. Chemical approaches towards the identification of novel MOR analgesics with reduced side effects include structural modifications of 14 -alkoxy-N-methylmorphinan- 6 -ones in key positions that are important for binding, selectivity, potency, and efficacy at opioid receptors. This paper describes a representative strategy to improve the therapeutic usefulness of opioid analgesics from the morphinan class of drugs by targeting position 5.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the toxicity and antinociceptive effects of ethanolic extracts of H. patens leaves. The toxicity of H. patens leaves (500 – 5000 mg/kg) was evaluated in acute (14 days) and subacute (28 days) assays. In the subacute assay, a blood analysis (both hematology and chemistry) was carried out. The antinociceptive effects of H. patens leaves (50 – 200 mg/kg) were evaluated using thermal-induced nociception (hot plate) and the chemical-induced nociceptive tests (acid acetic and formalin). In the acute toxicity test, the LD 50 estimated for H. patens leaves was 2964 mg/kg i. p. and > 5000 mg/kg p. o., whereas in the subacute test HPE did not affect hematological or biochemical parameters. In chemical-induced nociception models, H. patens (100 and 200 mg/kg p. o.) showed antinociceptive effects with similar activity than 100 mg/kg naproxen. In the hot plate test, HPE at 100 mg/kg (17 %) and 200 mg/kg (25 %) showed moderate antinociceptive effects. HPE could be a good source of <b>antinociceptive</b> <b>agents</b> because of its good activity and low toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{are effective}} anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs although they also induce unwanted side effects {{due to the}} inhibition of the physiological effects regulated by prostaglandins. This {{has led to the}} search for new compounds with fewer side effects, such as the nitro-NSAIDs (NO-NSAIDs). Paracetamol is an analgesic drug devoid of some of the side effect of the NSAIDs but without anti-inflammatory activity. NCX- 701 is a nitric oxide releasing version of paracetamol with anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. We have tested, in the single motor unit technique, the antinociceptive actions of intravenous cumulative doses of NCX- 701 vs paracetamol, studying their antinociceptive effects in responses to noxious mechanical and electrical stimulation (wind-up). Paracetamol did not induce any significant effect at the doses tested (maximum of 480 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1, 72. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1). NCX- 701 however was very effective in reducing responses to noxious mechanical stimulation (32 ± 10 % of control response) and wind-up (ED 50 of 147 ± 1 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1, 41. 5 ± 0. 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1). The inhibition was not reversed by 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 of the opioid antagonist naloxone. In control experiments performed with either the vehicle or the NO donor NOC- 18, no significant changes were observed in the nociceptive responses studied. We conclude that NCX- 701 is a very effective non-opioid <b>antinociceptive</b> <b>agent</b> in normal animals and its action is located mainly at central areas. The antinociceptive effect was not due solely to the release of NO...|$|E
40|$|Background C fibre {{hyperexcitability}} {{is fundamental}} to chronic pain development in humans and rodents; therefore, peripheral sensory neuronal sensitization {{plays a role in}} the development of mechanical hyperalgesia. However, the axonal properties and underlying mechanisms that are associated to these chronic pain states still require investigation. Methods Teased fibre electrophysiology of the saphenous nerve was used to identify C fibres in naïve and nerve-injured rats. C fibres were identified using electrical stimulation which further provided conduction velocity slowing profiles. From these nerve filaments evoked responses to mechanical stimuli were recorded. Vehicle or galanin were applied directly to the saphenous nerve trunk prior to stimulation. Results Increased levels of mechanically evoked activity in mechano-sensitive C fibres was associated to reduced conduction failure, enhanced conduction velocity latency recovery and reduced conduction velocity slowing. Mechanical hyperalgesia developed in nerve-injured animals in which mechano-sensitive C fibres demonstrated increased mechanically evoked responses and reduced rate of adaptation. Mechano-sensitive C fibres in nerve-injured animals had reduced levels of conduction velocity slowing, enhanced rate of conduction velocity recovery and reduced firing frequency failure versus naïve animals; all hallmarks of enhanced sensory neuronal excitability. Directly applying the <b>antinociceptive</b> <b>agent</b> galanin to the saphenous nerve trunk in naive animals led to increased conduction failure, reduced latency recovery rate and increased levels of conduction velocity slowing. Discussion Nerve injury-induced enhanced neural responses to mechanical stimulation are associated to defined parameters setout by conduction velocity slowing, mediated via axonal processing. Application of galanin inhibits axonal excitability...|$|E
40|$|Opioids are {{the most}} {{effective}} analgesics for pain management, and efficient pain control is a therapeutic priority. Herein, we describe the synthesis and pharmacological activities of the 5 -benzyl analogue of the μ opioid analgesic 14 -methoxymetopon (14 -MM). The result of {{the replacement of the}} 5 -methyl in 14 -MM with a benzyl group on in vitro opioid receptor binding and functional profiles, and in vivo behavioural properties, i. e. nociception and motor activity, was investigated. In rodent brain membranes, the 5 -benzyl derivative showed high affinity at the μ opioid receptor and decreased interaction with δ and κ receptors, hence displaying a similar binding profile as 14 -MM. It displayed potent agonist activity in vitro and in vivo. In in vitro guanosine- 5 ′-O-(3 -[35 S]thio) -triphosphate ([35 S]GTPγS) binding assay, it activated G-proteins in rat brain membranes through a μ opioid receptor-mediated mechanism having significantly enhanced potency compared to DAMGO (d-Ala 2,Me-Phe 4,Gly-ol 5]enkephalin), and to the μ opioid agonist morphinans 14 -MM, 14 -O-methyloxymorphone (14 -OMO) and morphine. In vivo, the 5 -benzyl analogue of 14 -MM elicited dose-dependent and naloxone-sensitive antinociceptive effects in hot-plate and tail-flick tests in mice after subcutaneous (s. c.) administration. Its analgesic potency was comparable to 14 -MM, and was 50 -fold higher than that of morphine. Contrary to morphine, 14 -MM and 14 -OMO, no motor dysfunction was produced by the new opioid in the mouse rotarod test at any of the tested doses. In summary, the 5 -benzyl analogue of 14 -MM emerged as a novel potent μ opioid <b>antinociceptive</b> <b>agent</b> with reduced propensity to cause unwanted motor impairment...|$|E
40|$|Research so far {{has only}} shown that edible red macroalgae, Sarcodia ceylanica {{has the ability to}} {{eliminate}} free radicals and anti-diabetic, anti-bacterial properties. This study was conducted both in vitro and in vivo on the ethyl acetate extract (PD 1) of farmed red macroalgae in order to explore its anti-inflammatory properties. In order to study the in vitro anti-inflammatory effects of PD 1, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce inflammatory responses in murine macrophages. For evaluating the potential in vivo anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects of PD 1, we used carrageenan-induced rat paw edema to produce inflammatory pain. The in vitro results indicated that PD 1 inhibited the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory protein, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in macrophages. Oral PD 1 can reduce carrageenan-induced paw edema and inflammatory nociception. PD 1 can significantly inhibit carrageenan-induced leukocyte infiltration, as well as the protein expression of inflammatory mediators (iNOS, interleukin- 1 β, and myeloperoxidase) in inflammatory tissue. The above results indicated that PD 1 has great potential to be turned into a functional food or used in the development of new anti-inflammatory and <b>antinociceptive</b> <b>agents.</b> The results from this study are expected to help scientists in the continued development of Sarcodia ceylanica for other biomedical applications...|$|R

One {{of the most}} important functions of the opioid system is the control of pain. Among the three main opioid receptor classes (μ, δ, κ), the μ (MOR) is the main type targeted for pharmacotherapy of pain. Opioid analgesics such as morphine, oxycodone and fentanyl are agonists at the MOR and are the mainstay for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pain. However, adverse effects related to opioid use are severe and often lead to early discontinuation and inadequate analgesia. The development of more effective and safer medications for themanagement of pain still remains amajor direction in pharmaceutical research. Chemical approaches towards the identification of novel MOR analgesics with reduced side effects include structural modifications of 14 -alkoxy-N-methylmorphinan- 6 -ones in key positions that are important for binding, selectivity, potency, and efficacy at opioid receptors. This paper describes a representative strategy to improve the therapeutic usefulness of opioid analgesics from the morphinan class of drugs by targeting position 5. The focus is on chemical and biological studies and structure-activity relationships of this series of ligands. We report on 14 -alkoxymorphinan- 6 -ones having amethyl and benzyl group at position 5 as strong opioid <b>antinociceptive</b> <b>agents</b> with reduced propensity to cause undesired effects compared to morphine although interacting selectively with MORs. 1...|$|R
40|$|Fifty-four Sprague-Dawley rats {{weighing}} 200 ~ 240 [*]g {{were randomly}} divided into sham-operated group (sham group), vehicle-treated SNL group (model group), and Tan IIA-treated SNL group (Tan IIA group). Tan IIA was administered intraperitoneally to rats in the Tan IIA-treated group at {{a dose of}} 30 [*]mg/kg daily for 14 days after SNL surgery. Paw withdrawal mechanical thresholds (PWTs) and paw withdrawal thermal latencies (PWLs) were measured. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1) and Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR 4) mRNA and protein expression in the spinal cord were measured. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β), and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) in the spinal cord were measured, too. Both the mechanical and heat pain thresholds were significantly decreased. After Tan IIA treatment, HMGB 1, and TLR 4 mRNA and protein levels, the expression of TNF-α and IF- 1 β was reduced significantly. In conclusion, Tanshinone IIA reversed SNL-induced thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia and downregulated HMGB 1 and TLR 4 levels and inhibited the HMGB 1 -TLR 4 pathway. Tanshinone IIA inhibited TNF-α and IL- 1 β expression but not IF- 10 expression in the spinal cords of SNL rats. These results indicate that Tanshinone IIA inhibited SNL-induced neuropathic pain via multiple effects, and targeting the HMGB 1 -TLR 4 pathway could {{serve as the basis}} of new <b>antinociceptive</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
