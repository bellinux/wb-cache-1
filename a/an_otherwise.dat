5|$|Ages for star {{clusters}} {{can be estimated}} by comparing the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram for the cluster with theoretical models of stellar evolution. Using this technique, ages for the Pleiades of between 75 and 150 million years have been estimated. The wide spread in estimated ages {{is a result of}} uncertainties in stellar evolution models, which include factors such as convective overshoot, in which a convective zone within a star penetrates <b>an</b> <b>otherwise</b> non-convective zone, resulting in higher apparent ages.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Felix was looping {{offshore}} {{the eastern}} United States, it produced swells of 26ft (8m) along the Nova Scotia coast on <b>an</b> <b>otherwise</b> sunny day. Beaches were closed. Buoys near the Newfoundland coast recorded wave heights of 49ft (15m), while buoys farther offshore reported wave heights of 82ft (27.5m). The outer rainbands {{of the storm}} dropped light rainfall, peaking at around 3.43mm (87mm) in northern Newfoundland. Offshore Caithness in Scotland, waves from the remnants of Felix submerged an experimental wave power station, damaging it further after previous waves damaged the system.|$|E
5|$|As already described, chiral liquid-crystal {{molecules}} usually {{give rise}} to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a stereogenic center. An additional requirement is that the system not be racemic: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, {{a small amount of}} chiral dopant in <b>an</b> <b>otherwise</b> achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{withdrawal}} from the area around Orsogna, the 2nd New Zealand Division {{was one of a}} number of divisions that was transferred from the Eighth Army to the Fifth Army, then engaged on the western side of the Apennines. This was part of an overall strategy to breach the Gustav Line and break <b>an</b> <b>otherwise</b> deadlocked Italian front. Together with the 4th Indian Division and supporting British and American artillery, the division formed the New Zealand Corps, under the command of Freyberg. The corps moved to Cassino, the defenders of which had resisted American forces for several weeks.|$|E

5|$|Gediminas' origins are unclear, {{but recent}} {{research}} suggests that Skalmantas, <b>an</b> <b>otherwise</b> unknown historical figure, was Gediminas' grandfather or father and {{could be considered the}} dynasty's founder. Because none of his brothers or sisters had known heirs, Gediminas, who sired at least twelve children, had the advantage in establishing sovereignty over his siblings. Known for his diplomatic skills, Gediminas arranged his children's marriages to suit the goals of his foreign policy: his sons consolidated Lithuanian power within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while his daughters established or strengthened alliances with the rulers of areas in modern-day Russia, Ukraine and Poland.|$|E

5|$|In DNA, fraying {{occurs when}} non-{{complementary}} regions exist {{at the end}} of <b>an</b> <b>otherwise</b> complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible. Branched DNA can be used in nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{entered the}} race for the Republican {{nomination}} for President in 2000, but he lost a heated primary season contest to George W. Bush of Texas. He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals, but was defeated by Democratic nominee Barack Obama in the general election, losing by a 365–173 electoral college margin. He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration, especially in regard to foreign policy matters. By 2013, however, he had become a key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in <b>an</b> <b>otherwise</b> partisan environment. In 2015, McCain became chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.|$|E

Although Feura Bush Road is now NY910A, an unsigned reference route, it was once part of NY32. From Feura Bush Road, NY335 heads northward as a two-lane street named Elsmere Avenue, passing several housing tracts in <b>an</b> <b>otherwise</b> open area of the town. After a half-mile (0.8km), the route meets the Delmar Bypass, a four-lane divided highway carrying NY32 through Bethlehem.
