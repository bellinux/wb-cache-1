25|$|MTV Unplugged in New York is a live album by American grunge band Nirvana.

25|$|Traditional folk music, {{having been}} in a slow decline from {{mainstream}} popularity since the 1970s, began to enjoy a resurgence in the 1990s, benefiting from the more general interest in World music. The arrival, and sometimes mainstream success, of acts like Kate Rusby, Nancy Kerr, Kathryn Tickell, Spiers and Boden, Seth Lakeman, Eliza Carthy, Runrig and Capercaillie, all largely concerned with <b>acoustic</b> <b>performance</b> of traditional material, marked a radical turn around in the fortunes of British folk music. This {{was reflected in the}} adoption creation of the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2000 and the profile for folk music was as high as it had been for over thirty years.|$|E
25|$|The head-joint tube is tapered {{slightly}} {{towards the}} closed end. Boehm described {{the shape of}} the taper as parabolic. Examination of his flutes did not reveal a true parabolic curve, but the taper is more complex than a truncated cone. The head joint is the most difficult part to construct because the lip plate and tone hole have critical dimensions, edges, and angles which vary slightly between manufacturers and in individual flutes, especially where they are handmade. Head joint geometry appears particularly critical to <b>acoustic</b> <b>performance</b> and tone, but there is no clear consensus on a particular shape amongst manufacturers. Acoustic impedance of the embouchure hole appears the most critical parameter. Critical variables affecting this acoustic impedance include: chimney length (hole between lip-plate and head tube), chimney diameter, and radiuses or curvature of the ends of the chimney. Generally, the shorter the hole, the more quickly a flute can be played; the longer the hole, the more complex the tone. Finding a particularly good example of a flute is dependent on play-testing. Head joint upgrades are usually suggested as a way to improve the tone of an instrument.|$|E

25|$|The peak of {{traditional}} English folk, like progressive and electric folk, was the mid- to late-1970s, when, {{for a time}} it threatened to break through into the mainstream. By {{the end of the}} decade, however, it was in decline. The attendance at, and numbers of folk clubs began to decrease, probably as new musical and social trends, including punk rock, new wave and electronic music began to dominate. Although many acts like Martin Carthy and the Watersons continued to perform successfully, there were very few significant new acts pursuing traditional forms in the 1980s. This began to change with a new generation in the 1990s. The arrival and sometimes mainstream success of acts like Kate Rusby, Bellowhead, Nancy Kerr, Kathryn Tickell, Jim Moray, Spiers and Boden, Seth Lakeman, Frank Turner, Laura Marling and Eliza Carthy, all largely concerned with <b>acoustic</b> <b>performance</b> {{of traditional}} material, marked a radical turn around in the fortunes of the tradition. This was reflected in the adoption creation of the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2000, which gave the music a much needed status and focus and the profile of folk music is as high in England today as it has been for over thirty years.|$|E

It {{is one of five}} such acoustic performances that Lewis recorded of songs from Glassheart in August 2012. Deekay from soul music website Soulculture.co.uk praised the <b>acoustic</b> <b>performance,</b> saying that while the original version [...] "just about added up to the sum of its individually brilliant parts", the acoustic [...] " [...] perhaps even better than the original".

Jordan Zivitz of Montreal Gazette praised the performance, writing that the dancers [...] "nearly stole the show in their employer’s absence during another costume change, set to Illuminati's woozy thump".
