25|$|A small core of men, {{mostly in}} Companies A and E, were {{veterans}} of General N. B. Pearce's Brigade of Arkansas State Troops and had fought at Wilson's Creek in 1861, mostly in Captain Larkin Bunch's {{company of the}} 4th Regiment, Arkansas State Troops. These men were mostly pro-Southern in attitude; but by far {{the majority of the}} men conscripted into the other companies in the regiment were either pro-Union or decidedly neutral and wanted <b>absolutely</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with the war. They were conscripted to fight for a cause they did not believe in. This attitude is expressed very clearly in the autobiography of Pleasant Houston Spears.|$|E

[...] "I couldn't believe it was happening. Casablanca had been my creation; Jack had <b>absolutely</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with it. As the audience gasped, I {{tried to get out}} of the row of seats and into the aisle, but the entire Warner family sat blocking me. I had no alternative but to sit down again, humiliated and furious.... Almost forty years later, I still haven't recovered from the shock." ...|$|E
500|$|Kaja: 1988–2008 {{became a}} bestseller in Norway. The book reached second {{place on the}} bestseller list of the Bestseller Association in Norway for general literature, in May 2009. Kaja: 1988–2008 sparked renewed {{controversy}} over perceptions of Scientology activities in Norway. In {{a review of the}} book, Dagbladet noted that because the author was writing both as a private individual and as a physician, [...] "he is trained to look at the familiar and intimate with professionalism and distance." [...] Upon the book's publication, representative Matthias Fosse of the Church of Scientology stated, [...] "Church of Scientology had <b>absolutely</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with this young woman's decision to take her own life. We are sorry for the loss the family has suffered, but this young woman was never a member of the Church of Scientology and never participated in any of the church activities." ...|$|E

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{said the}} episode [...] "had plenty of standout bits" [...] {{but that it}} [...] "represented a major flaw" [...] and [...] "perhaps in the program as a whole", citing that [...] "here {{seems to be more}} of an emphasis on comedic 'bits' rather than comedic 'situations,' which doesn't bode well for a situation comedy." [...] He explained that [...] "The Baby Show" [...] in particular [...] "felt very disjointed, bouncing between jokes more than storylines. It even opened with a Jenna surprise-birthday segment that was funny for what it was, but had <b>absolutely</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the rest of}} the show." [...] Canning gave the episode a 7.0 out 10 rating. TV Guides Matt Mitovich liked that Josh had a story in this episode, and said that his impression of Tracy was [...] "pretty good". He remarked that [...] "The Baby Show" [...] was [...] "a solid episode, if a bit too theme-y for my broad-sitcom liking." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{taking a}} pay cut to start the 1949 season, Feller pitched on Opening Day against the St. Louis Browns. During the game, he injured his {{shoulder}} and missed the rest of April. His performances were mixed {{in the rest of}} the season and he finished the year with a 15-14 record and a 3.75 ERA. Before the 1950 season, Feller suggested to Indians management he take {{a pay cut}}, and did so. Indians general manager Hank Greenberg said, [...] "He himself made the suggestion. In fact, he offered to take more than the 25 per cent maximum pay cut allowed. There was <b>absolutely</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> it. We all agreed quickly on the figure after Bob showed up yesterday." [...] In a win over the Detroit Tigers in the second game of a doubleheader, Feller became the 53rd pitcher to win 200 games. Throughout the year, players noted that his velocity had returned, and, winning games with finesse rather than power, he was again effective. He finished the year with 16 wins and a 3.43 ERA.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Washington Post, Khalifa said the controversial scene was satirical and should be taken as such, claiming that Hollywood films depicted Muslims in a far more negative light than any pornographer could. Among those who publicly spoke out to defend her decision to become an adult performer was British-Lebanese author Nasri Atallah, who stated, [...] "The moral indignation ... is wrong for two reasons. First and foremost, as a woman, she is free to do as she pleases with her body. As a sentient human being with agency, who lives halfway across the world, she {{is in charge of}} her own life and owes <b>absolutely</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> the country where she happened to be born." [...] Khalifa herself said of the controversy: [...] "Women's rights in Lebanon are a long way from being taken seriously if a Lebanese American porn star that no longer resides there can cause such an uproar. What I once boasted to people as being the most Westernized nation in the Middle East, I now see as devastatingly archaic and oppressed." ...|$|E

The {{lyrics of}} the album focus on real world events, such as Hurricane Katrina and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

[...] On January 12, 2011, Rise Against announced the release date of Endgame as March 15, 2011.

500|$|Following {{the release}} of Jessica Jones, David Priest at net wrote about how the series rescues [...] "Marvel from itself ... Jessica Jones takes big steps forward in terms of theme, craft and diversity. It's a good story first, and a superhero show second. And for the first time, the MCU seems like it matters. Our culture needs stories like this. Here's hoping Marvel keeps them coming." [...] For Paul Tassi and Erik Kain of Forbes, {{watching}} the series made them question the MCU, with Kain feeling that the [...] "morally complex, violent, dark world of Jessica Jones {{has no place in}} the MCU ... right now, the MCU is holding back shows like Jessica Jones and Daredevil, while those shows are contributing <b>absolutely</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> the MCU." [...] Tassi {{went so far as to}} wonder what [...] "the point of the Marvel Cinematic Universe" [...] is, lamenting the lack of major crossovers in the franchise since the Winter Soldier reveal on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and saying that Jessica Jones is [...] "so far removed from the world of The Avengers, it might as well not be in the same universe at all ... really don't understand the point of [...] if they're going to keep everything within it separated off in these little boxes". Conversely, Eric Francisco of Inverse called Jessica Joness lack of overt connections to the MCU [...] "the show's chief advantage. Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU's scope really is, Jessica Jones also proves the MCU's thematic durability." ...|$|E
