Data were collected from different contractors, consultants & clients to analyses the contractor's financing state {{and the effect of}} the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> methods on the contractor's finance. Interviews and the documentary research are the two methods adopted for the data collection. From the data analysed during this research {{it is clear that the}} almost of all contractors are facing to cash flow problems during the projects. The existing <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> practice of providing 20 % advance at the beginning of the project is not sufficient to overcome these cash flow problems. Therefore improvement in the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> system is urgently required for the development of the construction sector in Sri Lanka. The main conclusions of the research were that a better <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> proposal couldn't be generalize. The three advance payment" proposals considered in the research were: A. Providing <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> of 20 % at the beginning. B. 20 % advance at the beginning and another 10 % advance at the middle third of the project; and C. Providing 20 % advance & the material advances for the main construction materials. The suitable <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> proposal has a greater bearing on the variable factors for the contractors finance. These variable factors and their effect on each of these <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> proposals are analysed and presented. By observing in to the data analysed it's clear that the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> system for each and every contract, must be decided by considering limitations of the contractors finance. Presently the client & the consultant decide the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> method. But this system has to be modified, as the contractor will be able to request for his preferred <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> option. By looking in to the other possible alternatives available for the contractors,(for to find the finance); going for his preferred <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> system is profitable for the contractor even after allowing of a discount to the client. Therefore the existing <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> system can be used to improve the contractors finance without increasing the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> percentage. However allowing the selection of the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> option to the contractor may create an another difficulty in evaluation of the contracts at the tendering stage. If the request for discount percentages, for each and every <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> option &their modifications (Delayed <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> recovery or reduced payback period) are included in the tender document the evaluation of the tender can be done under the grounds of equity...|$|R

The Greek navy argued that the ship, which was designed in 1912, was now obsolete and that under the Treaty of Versailles it could not be armed by the German shipyard anyway. The Greeks requested that Vulcan return <b>advance</b> <b>payments</b> made before the war had stopped work. The dispute went before the Greco-German Mixed Arbitral Tribunal (established under Article 304 of the Treaty of Versailles), which dragged on throughout the 1920s. In 1924, a Dutch admiral was appointed by the tribunal to evaluate the Greek complaints, and he ultimately sided with Vulcan, probably in part due to Greek inquiries to Vulcan earlier that year as to the possibility of modernizing the design. Vulcan's response did not satisfy Greek requirements, so the proposal was dropped.|$|E

Accurate cash flow forecasting is essential to all contractors in the construction Industry for successful operation and existence in the long run. At initial stages of a project the cash flow aspect of the contractor is negative. The main role of project financing is to cover up this negative flow in a beneficial, cost effective manner. Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> enhances the quality and productivity in the construction industry. It improves the performance and cost efficiency of the contractors as well as the clients. Cash data in relation to thirty projects were collected. Three criteria, no Mobilization Advance, 20 % of the initial contract sum as the Mobilization Advance paid at the inception of the project and 20 % of the initial contract sum as Mobilization Advance given in stages, were identified to determine the differences in the effects of cash flow. The effect of these different criteria on the cumulative cash flow was examined. Further Scheduled Performance Index was calculated for further analysis. Results show and confirm that Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> has a big bearing on the contractors' existence and their motivation towards attaining objectives of the project. Research confirms that Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> is a necessity in the Sri Lankan construction industry.

2500|$|The {{unsustainable}} {{exploitation of}} these tropical hardwoods, particularly rosewood from the SAVA Region, has escalated significantly {{since the start}} of the 2009 Malagasy political crisis. [...] Thousands of poorly paid Malagasy loggers have flooded into the national parks—especially in the northeast—building roads, setting up logging camps, and cutting down even the most difficult to reach rosewood trees. [...] Illegal activities are openly flaunted, armed militia have descended upon local villages, and a rosewood mafia easily bribe government officials, buying export permits with ease. [...] These illegal operations are funded in part by <b>advance</b> <b>payments</b> for future shipments (financed by Chinese expatriates and Chinese importers) and by loans from large, international banks. [...] Demand is fueled mostly by a growing Chinese middle class and their desire for exotic imperial-style furniture. [...] European and American demand for high-end musical instruments and furniture have also played a role. [...] However, public scrutiny has put significant pressure on shipping companies involved in the trade, and the United States is starting to enforce the Lacey Act by investigating companies with suspected involvement in the illegal trade of Malagasy precious woods.|$|E

[...] The EIA and Global Witness reported further that logging operations also received significant funds from a network of Chinese importers based in Antananarivo. [...] These importers are part of a recently established expatriate community of Chinese people in Madagascar. [...] Many hold passports due to a questionable practice started by the Prime Minister under former president Marc Ravalomanana, where Chinese immigrants could buy passports for 500,000 ariary or $2,500 per person. [...] According to an October issue of the Madagascar Tribune, these importers operate by selling Chinese household and electronic goods in Madagascar, using artificial customs declarations to under-report both their sales and their revenue, and then instead of repatriating the proceeds, they use the money to finance the tropical wood purchases of their compatriots in the SAVA Region.|$|E
