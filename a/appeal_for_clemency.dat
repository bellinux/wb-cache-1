25|$|Jaywant Joglekar, who {{authored}} a book euologising Savarkar as 'Father of Hindu Nationalism', considers Savarkar's <b>appeal</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> {{a tactical}} ploy, like Shivaji's letter to Aurangzeb, during his arrest at Agra etc.|$|E
25|$|August 24, 2007 – Secretary Ermita officially announces that, due to {{political}} implications, the <b>appeal</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> by the 14 soldiers was archived, {{even if the}} Bureau of Pardons and Parole was still reviewing the plea. Ermita refuses to give a timeframe for the review.|$|E
25|$|Following the Supreme Court decision, an <b>appeal</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> {{was made}} to U.S. President Harry S Truman; Truman, however, {{declined}} to intervene and left the matter entirely {{in the hands of}} the military authorities. In due course, General MacArthur confirmed the sentence of the Commission.|$|E
50|$|After Jarvie {{successfully}} <b>appeals</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> <b>for</b> {{them from}} the lady, pleading kinship, Frank is sent as emissary to the Duke's camp.

25|$|Eventually, the Lehi {{members were}} found guilty and, on 18 January 1945, sentenced to death. Their <b>appeals</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> were dismissed, {{probably}} partly in response to pressure from Winston Churchill, who had been Moyne's ally and close personal friend. They were hanged on 23 March 1945.|$|R
50|$|Subsequently, {{some of the}} Donatists {{engaged in}} {{sporadic}} violence against orthodox priests. Marcellinus presided at the trials of those arrested. Augustine <b>appealed</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> both to Marcellinus and Marcellinus's brother Apringius, who was proconsul for Africa. Noonan views the fact that Augustine and Marcellinus remained close friends as suggesting that the bishop's petition was granted.|$|R
25|$|In 1999, the U.S. Supreme Court {{declined}} to overturn Jones's death sentence. Jones's final <b>appeal</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> from President of the United States George W. Bush and his final appeal at the U.S. Supreme Court failed on March 17, 2003. On March 18, 2003, Jones was executed at USP Terre Haute, {{making him the}} third federal prisoner executed since federal executions resumed in 2001. McBride's family and a friend attended the execution.|$|E
25|$|Sandiford {{had seven}} days to {{lodge an appeal}} {{following}} the sentence. An initial letter of appeal drafted by diplomats was rejected by court officials because guidelines require an appeal to be filed from the prison. On 28 January Gede Ketut Rantam, registrar of Denpasar District Court in Bali confirmed his office had received an appeal request from Sandiford. She was then given a further fourteen days to file a more detailed appeal. The appellate system of Indonesia has three levels; the High Court, the Supreme Court, and a direct <b>appeal</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> to the President.|$|E
25|$|The two men {{became the}} first Westerners to be {{executed}} under Malaysia's new tougher laws for drug offences that prescribe death for anyone convicted of having over 15grams of heroin. Barlow {{was born in the}} United Kingdom in Stoke-on-Trent and held dual British and Australian nationalities. Barlow's family made appeals to Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher to make a protest about the impending execution, and Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Bill Hayden made an <b>appeal</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> to the Malaysian government. The executions caused public outcry and strained political relations between Australia and Malaysia at the time.|$|E
25|$|Napalm Death also congratulated the {{president}} of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, {{a fan of the}} band, on their Facebook fan page recently; however, after the Bali Nine and the Lindsay Sandiford case, he came under fire from the band, as well as many others within the metal scene including Tony Iommi, after their <b>appeals</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> were ignored.|$|R
5000|$|Petre Gheorghe and Nicolae Atanasoff {{were found}} guilty of [...] "crime against the state's security", being sentenced to capital punishment—as had been {{requested}} by the military prosecutor, Major P. Pârvănescu. The accused were then held at the Ploiești Penitentiary. Their <b>appeals</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> were denied, as was a request for pardon that they sent to King Michael I.|$|R
50|$|Attempts by his {{counsel and}} {{sympathetic}} friends to secure his release were unsuccessful, despite his <b>appeals</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency.</b> Initially {{he agreed to}} be bound over, but he retracted on learning that the other prisoners had refused to be bailed. He was fined 2000 marks and imprisoned in the Tower until his release in 1633, by which time his first wife had died.|$|R
25|$|Hendricks codified Indiana's {{laws for}} the first time in 1822, {{creating}} the Indiana Code. In 1824 a Seneca family was murdered by a group of men near Pendleton, Indiana, and tension between the natives in northern Indiana and the settlements in central Indiana moved quickly toward conflict. Governor Hendricks, hoping to maintain peace and enforce justice for the tribe, ordered the murderers to be captured and tried. While one of the murderers escaped, the others where captured and all were sentenced to death. One of the murderers was a minor and was later pardoned by Governor James B. Ray. Governor Hendricks had denied his <b>appeal</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> and used the execution to show the natives his goodwill. This was the first time a white man was executed for killing a Native American in the United States.|$|E
25|$|With the {{expulsion}} of the Jesuits from the Baja California peninsula, Gálvez engaged the Franciscan Order {{to take over the}} spiritual affairs of the missions there. Even after the arrival of Junípero Serra and his fellow Franciscan friars, the Spanish military — having evicted the Jesuits from the missions they had established — continued running the missions' practical business. In 1768, Gálvez toured the Baja chain of missions. Angered over the sloppy administration he found there, he reprimanded the soldier commissioners stationed at the missions. In August, he signed a decree turning all of Baja's missions — except mission Loreto — over fully to the Franciscan friars. He banned card-playing and gambling at mission settlements. Overruling the Franciscans' <b>appeal</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> for miscreant soldiers, Gálvez punished most of them by assigning them to the upcoming expedition to Alta California — and discharged the rest from military service.|$|E
25|$|The four-month trial, {{which began}} on April 11, 1961, was highly publicized and covered by radio, newspaper, and {{television}} journalists {{from around the}} world. Of the 756 seats made available in the theatre, 474 were designated {{for members of the}} press; journalists also viewed the proceedings via closed-circuit television in an adjacent press room. Another 570 viewers watched on a closed-circuit screen in the nearby Ratisbonne Monastery. Israelis had the opportunity to watch live television broadcasts of the proceedings, and videotape was flown daily to the United States for broadcast the following day. A bulletproof glass wall was erected between the stage where the judges sat and the spectator seating, and Eichmann sat inside his own bulletproof glass booth with armed guards at his side. The trial concluded on August 14, 1961; on December 13 the court found Eichmann guilty of crimes against humanity. The death penalty was issued on December 15. Eichmann's attorneys appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court, but the court upheld the verdict on May 29, 1962. After a last-minute <b>appeal</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> to Israeli president Yitzhak Ben-Zvi was also refused, Eichmann was executed shortly after midnight on June 1, 1962.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, both Däubler-Gmelin and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer <b>appealed</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> <b>for</b> the LaGrand brothers, two German {{citizens}} {{sentenced to}} death in Arizona. According to the German government, the LaGrands had been denied their rights as German citizens because prosecutors did not inform the German consulate of the brothers' arrest in 1982 until a decade later. However, both were put {{to death in a}} cloud of cyanide gas.|$|R
50|$|The son of Basque {{immigrants}} from Bizkaia and a native {{speaker of the}} Basque language, Cenarrusa has been a longtime proponent of increased autonomy in the Basque Country, particularly in Spain. In the 1970s he worked with the Democratic U.S. Senator from Idaho, Frank Church, {{in an effort to}} curtail foreign aid to the Franco regime. Cenarrusa has also <b>appealed</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> <b>for</b> Basque political prisoners in Spain.|$|R
50|$|Two days later, after <b>appeals</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> {{had been}} turned down, they became two of the last people in Germany to be {{beheaded}} by axe, at Plötzensee Prison in Berlin. In 1938, Adolf Hitler decreed that all future executions should be by hanging or the guillotine, although {{at least one other}} woman, the Romanian-Jewish communist Olga Bancic, did later die by the axe in Stuttgart in 1944.|$|R
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 12 March, while sailing near the Louisiade Islands, one of the ship's stokers was stabbed {{fourteen}} times, and died from peritonitis during the night. Before dying, the stoker informed the ship's surgeon that he had threatened to expose the homosexual relationship between two other stokers, {{which led to the}} attack. The two accused stokers were imprisoned, and a court-martial was held between 15 and 18 March, while the ship was anchored at Nouméa. The stokers were found guilty of the first ever murder aboard an Australian warship; under British naval regulations (which the RAN was operating under), the men were to be hanged from the cruiser's yardarm. However, despite Captain Harold Farncomb's aggressive prosecution of the two men, he successfully requested that the death sentences be put off at least until the ship returned home. As the men were convicted under British military law, the matter of commuting their sentences was out of Australian hands until an <b>appeal</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> was made to King George VI, who downgraded the sentence to life imprisonment. This situation had arisen because the Australian government had not yet adopted the Statute of Westminster 1931, a British Act which defined the Dominions as sovereign governments capable of amending or repealing previous British legislation affecting them, while preventing the British government from legislating on the Dominions' behalf unless requested. Prompted by the murder, along with issues relating to the legal control of shipping in Australian ports, and the National Security Act, a bill ratifying the Statute was passed on 9 October and backdated {{to the start of the}} war. The sentences of the two stokers were reduced several times, and they were freed in September 1950.|$|E
2500|$|Found {{guilty of}} these charges they have been sentenced to hang and their <b>appeal</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> dismissed. This is not a {{reprisal}} for the execution of three Jews but a [...] "routine judicial fact." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yong's lawyer {{urged the}} Government of Malaysia to take Yong's {{case to the}} International Court of Justice to {{determine}} whether Singapore's conduct has violated local and international law. Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman subsequently sent an <b>appeal</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> on Yong's behalf to the Singapore Government in July 2010.|$|E
5000|$|Having {{made some}} {{criticisms of the}} Nazi régime, {{including}} the statement [...] "This {{is the end of}} the Third Reich, and the guilty can now be brought to punishment", Arndt was denounced in 1944 and sentenced to death on 11 May. Despite many <b>appeals</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> from academic quarters, Arndt was executed on 26 June 1944 at Zuchthaus Brandenburg-Görden. He was 53 years old.|$|R
50|$|Visitors still {{flocked to}} Vásquez's jail cell, {{many of them}} women. He signed autographs and posed for photographs. Vásquez sold the photos {{from the window of}} his cell and used {{the money to pay for}} his legal defense. After his conviction, he <b>appealed</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency.</b> It was denied by Governor Romualdo Pacheco. Vásquez calmly met his fate in San Jose on March 19, 1875. He was 39 years old.|$|R
50|$|August 21, 2007 - The 24th {{anniversary of}} Ninoy’s murder. Chief Justice Andres Narvasa <b>appealed</b> <b>for</b> {{the closure of}} the case; Juan Ponce Enrile asked for the review <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> in favor of the 14 convicts; Palawan Bishop Pedro Arigo, {{chairman}} of the CBCP’s Episcopal Commission on Prison Pastoral Care (ECPPC) asked pardon for the convicts; Corazon Aquino and Benigno Aquino III forgave the 14 soldiers but opposed their <b>appeals</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> or parole (which Sec. Raul Gonzales submitted to the President on 2004); Eduardo Ermita stated that the Bureau of Pardons and Parole had recommended a grant of executive clemency.|$|R
2500|$|West Australian newspaper: -Transferred {{to death}} row, Penang jail (August 1985) and await news of their <b>appeal</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> (Nov. 1985 - June 1986.

2500|$|After the {{rejection}} of their appeal, Australia's Foreign Minister Bill Hayden contacted the Governor of Penang asking that the sentence be commuted to imprisonment on humanitarian grounds. Hayden stated that [...] "I have always been and remain firmly opposed to capital punishment, and accordingly I will be pressing the presentation of this <b>appeal</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> with {{a great sense of}} urgency." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 1987 {{an amnesty}} was {{announced}} by the Gorbachev Politburo, but it required individual prisoners to write an <b>appeal</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency,</b> and to sign a statement promising not to commit [...] "illegal" [...] behavior in the future, before they were freed. Like {{a number of other}} political prisoners Velikanova refused to agree to such conditions, and she served her full term of exile.|$|E
2500|$|After his arrest, Glitter {{was turned}} over to provincial police from Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu and {{returned}} to Vũng Tàu and held on suspicion of having sex with the two underage girls. Glitter was held in jail throughout the criminal investigation, which was completed on 26 December 2005. The charge of rape was dropped for [...] "lack of evidence" [...] (according to Glitter's lawyer), although the singer admitted that an 11-year-old girl had slept in his bed. Glitter could have faced execution by firing squad if found guilty of child rape. After having received compensatory payments from Glitter, the families of the girls <b>appealed</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency</b> <b>for</b> him.|$|R
50|$|In 1999 whilst {{evacuating}} Yugoslavia, Pratt {{and fellow}} Australian Peter Wallace and Yugoslav Branko Jelen, were arrested by Yugoslav authorities and accused of spying for NATO and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Pratt {{was forced to}} make a video taped confession, which was broadcast worldwide. After spending 5 months of a 12-year sentence in jail in Yugoslavia, he was released in September 1999 by former Serb Leader, Slobodan Milosevic after <b>appeals</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency.</b>|$|R
50|$|Private Smith (army serial number: 33288266) was {{subsequently}} court-martialled at RAF Attlebridge, {{convicted of murder}} and executed by hanging on the gallows at HMP Shepton Mallet on 8 May 1945 (i.e. VE day), despite <b>appeals</b> <b>for</b> <b>clemency,</b> including one from Lady Ellen Teichman. His companion, Private Wijpacha was charged with being an accessory to murder, but was not sentenced to death.
