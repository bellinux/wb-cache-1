2500|$|Kelp forests {{have been}} {{important}} to human existence for thousands of years. Indeed, many now theorise that the first colonisation of the Americas was due to fishing communities following the Pacific kelp forests during the last ice age. One theory contends that the kelp forests that would have stretched from northeast Asia to the American Pacific coast would have provided many benefits to ancient boaters. The kelp forests would have provided many sustenance opportunities, as well as acting {{as a type of}} buffer from rough water. Besides these benefits, researchers believe that the kelp forests might have helped early boaters navigate, acting as a type of [...] "kelp highway". Theorists also suggest that the kelp forests would have helped these ancient colonists by providing a stable way of life and preventing them from having to adapt to new ecosystems and develop new survival methods even as they traveled thousands of miles. [...] Modern economies are based on fisheries of kelp-associated species such as [...] lobster and rockfish. Humans can also harvest kelp directly to feed aquaculture species such as [...] abalone and to extract the compound <b>alginic</b> acid, which is used in products like toothpaste and antacids. Kelp forests are valued for recreational activities such as SCUBA diving and kayaking; the industries that support these sports represent one benefit related to the ecosystem and the enjoyment derived from these activities represents another. All of these are examples of ecosystem services provided specifically by kelp forests.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Alginic</b> acid, {{also called}} algin or alginate, is an anionic {{polysaccharide}} distributed widely {{in the cell}} walls of brown algae, where through binding with water it forms a viscous gum.

50|$|The {{processes}} for {{the manufacture of}} sodium alginate from brown seaweeds fall into two categories: 1) Calcium alginate method and, 2) <b>Alginic</b> acid method. The chemistry of the processes used to make sodium alginate from brown seaweeds is relatively simple. The difficulties of the processes arise from the physical separations which are required, such as the need to filter slimy residues from viscous solutions or to separate gelatinous precipitates which hold large amounts of liquid within the structure and which resist filtration and centrifugation.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that phlorotannins are first sequestered in physodes under their polar, reactive form before being oxidized and complexed to the <b>alginic</b> acid of brown algla cell wall by a peroxidase.

50|$|L digitata was {{traditionally}} {{used as a}} fertiliser {{and spread}} on the land. In the 18th century it was burnt to extract the potash it contained {{for use in the}} glass industry.

It is still used as an organic fertiliser but also for the extraction of <b>alginic</b> acid, the manufacture of toothpastes and cosmetics, and in the food industry for binding, thickening and moulding. It is used in Japan and China for making dashi, a soup stock, and for other culinary purposes.|$|E
50|$|Alginate, or <b>alginic</b> acid, is {{a natural}} acidic linear {{polysaccharide}} derived from seaweed. It is composed of α-L-guluronate and β-D-mannuronate. Bulk alginate is widely used in the food industry and for medical purposes due to its unique characteristics such as high viscosity in aqueous solution and gel-forming property {{in the presence of}} calcium ions. Previous studies have also shown that alginate oligosaccharides may act as growth promoting agents on some plant cells. The effect of an alginate oligosaccharide mixture (AOM) on N. oculata was studied. The growth rate of this alga was significantly increased by AOM. Moreover, AOM appeared to alleviate the algicidal effect of Cu2+ significantly. These results suggests that AOM can be used a growth promoting supplement for N. oculata culture.|$|E

50|$|Eisenia arborea, or the {{southern}} sea palm (not {{to be confused}} with the sea palm), is a dominant species of kelp that is found in the Northern and Eastern Pacific from Vancouver Island, Canada south to Isla Magdalena, Mexico, and along the coast of Baja California. They are commonly found from the midtidal areas stretching to the subtidal areas. It is an edible seaweed, a source of nutrients for grazing marine invertebrates and a source of <b>alginic</b> acid, a food thickener. Some of the algas have a hollow stripe above its holdfast with two branches terminating in multiple blades. Eisenia arborea is studied in order to predict environmental stress in oceans intertidal zones. Hollow stripes where present when the Eisenia arborea did not receive essential nutrients for its thalli development. Eisenia arborea with hollow stripes are believed to be evolved algae in order to increase their survival in harsh living conditions. They play a huge role in determining environmental stress.|$|E
5000|$|A Taiwanese manufacturer's {{recipe for}} {{imitation}} shark fin (素翅) contains water, gelatin, <b>alginic</b> acid, sugar, casein, and triolein {{to reproduce the}} chewy, gelatinous texture of shark fins. It is known as suchì in Chinese Mandarin and sou ci in Chinese Cantonese, literally means [...] "vegetarian fin". Konjac gel (known as moyu tofu in Chinese Mandarin, mo wu dau fu in Chinese Cantonese, and konnyaku in Japanese) {{can also be used}} as a substitute for shark fin once it is shredded into thin strands using a grater or food processor. While cellophane noodles are also often used as an alternative to shark fins, some cooks find them too soft and unable to withstand longer cooking that allows flavors to be absorbed. Other substitutes for shark fin are cucurbita ficifolia (shark fin melon), chicken breast, jinhua ham, vermicelli, soy, and pig's skin or gelatin. As with shark fin soups, ingredients such as edible mushrooms, kelps, seaweeds, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and beaten eggs may be used to improve the taste.|$|E
