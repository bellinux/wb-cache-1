5|$|Helium is {{the least}} {{water-soluble}} monatomic gas, {{and one of the}} least water-soluble of any gas (CF4, SF6, and C4F8 have lower mole fraction solubilities: 0.3802, 0.4394, and 0.2372 x2/10−5, respectively, versus helium's 0.70797 x2/10−5), and helium's index of refraction is closer to unity than that of any other gas. Helium has a negative Joule–Thomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand. Only below its Joule–Thomson inversion temperature (of about 32 to 50K <b>at</b> <b>1</b> <b>atmosphere)</b> does it cool upon free expansion. Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling.|$|E

40|$|To {{characterize}} early {{blood and}} tissue markers predictive of decompression sickness (DCS), this {{study focused on}} identifying changes in inflammatory mediators during the 24 -h period immediately following compression-decompression of female Sprague-Dawley rats. Early blood and tissue markers predictive of DCS include inflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). Increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), were detected in the circulation 6 h after decompression. Increased levels of only IL- 6 were observed at 24 h. Compared with control animals maintained <b>at</b> <b>1</b> <b>atmospheres</b> absolute pressure ATA (101 kPascal), significant increases in expression of E-selectin, and L-selectin, as well as intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), were observed immunohistochemically in the lungs and brains of the rats 6 h after exposure to 2 (203 kPascal), 3 (303 kPascal), or 4 (404 kPascal) ATA, followed by rapid decompression. These levels drop by 24 h. In contrast to the observations in brain, greater increases in expression of E-selectin and L-selectin around vessels and connective tissue were seen at 24 h after decompression in the quadriceps of rats exposed to either 3 or 4 ATA. Significant increases in expression of the A 2 A receptor, which modulates inflammation by downregulating production of these cytokines, were detected only in the quadriceps removed at 24 h after decompression from 4 ATA.
