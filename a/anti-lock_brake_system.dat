25|$|ESC {{is built}} {{on top of an}} <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system,</b> and all ESC-equipped {{vehicles}} are fitted with traction control. The ESC components include a yaw rate sensor, a lateral acceleration sensor, a steering wheel sensor, and an upgraded integrated control unit. In the US, Federal regulations require that ESC be installed as a standard feature on all passenger cars and light trucks as of the 2012 model year. According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration research, ABS in 2005 cost an estimated US$368; ESC cost a further US$111. The retail price of ESC varies; as a stand-alone option it retails for as little as $250 USD. ESC was once rarely offered as a sole option, and was generally not available for aftermarket installation. Instead, it was frequently bundled with other features or more expensive trims, so the cost of a package that included ESC was several thousand dollars. Nonetheless, ESC is considered highly cost-effective and it might pay for itself in reduced insurance premiums.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2012, General Atomics {{released}} a new trailing arm {{design for the}} Reaper's main landing gear; benefits include an over 30 percent increase in landing weight capacity, a 12 percent increase in gross takeoff weight (from [...] to [...] ), a maintenance-free shock absorber (eliminating the need for nitrogen pressurization), a fully rejected takeoff brake system, and provisions for automatic takeoff and landing capability and <b>Anti-lock</b> <b>Brake</b> <b>System</b> (ABS) field upgrades. In April 2012, General Atomics announced possible upgrades to USAF Reapers, including two extra [...] fuel pods under the wings to increase endurance to 37 hours. The wingspan can also be increased to , increasing endurance to 42 hours. The USAF has bought 38 Reaper Extended Range (ER) versions, carrying external fuel tanks (which don't affect weapon capacity), the heavy-weight landing gear, a four-bladed propeller, a new fuel management system which ensures fuel and thermal balance among external tank, wing, and fuselage fuel sources, and an alcohol water injection (AWI) system to shorten required runway takeoff length; these features increase endurance from 27 to 33–35 hours, while the company is still pitching the lengthened wing option. The Reaper ER first flew operationally in August 2015. The aircraft also has the sensor ball replaced with a high-definition camera, better communications so ground controllers can see the higher quality video, software to enable automatic detection of threats and tracking of 12 moving targets at once, {{and the ability to}} [...] "super ripple" [...] fire missiles within 0.32 seconds of each other.|$|E

50|$|The 1010 and 1110 {{have the}} same weight rating, the {{difference}} being in the front suspension: independent, by torsion-bars, for the 1010, and of a solid I-beam construction for the 1110 (and all heavier versions). A first for the segment was the option of a Bendix <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> called Adaptive Braking System by International. Operating only on the rear wheels, it was made available the pickups (and Travelalls) in late 1971. Due to the expense of this novel system, it was a rarely selected option.|$|E

50|$|Slidepad is an Intelligent Brake Distribution (IBD) technology, {{aimed at}} making braking easier for novice or casual cyclists, {{integrates}} into V-brake systems to provide single-lever braking. It modulates the front brake force in real time, {{based on the}} road surface and rider weight position, and avoids front wheel lockup accidents when applying the front brake. It was designed to prevent riders from flipping over their handlebars when applying the front brake. Once the brake pads {{make contact with the}} rear wheel, the Slidepad slides forward, which pulls a cable that is connected to the front brakes.
