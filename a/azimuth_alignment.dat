The [...] "Auto Center Phase" [...] and [...] "Learn Phase" [...] features will also work, but are not recommended. There are sometimes slight offsets caused by various mixing effects and, to a lesser extent, tape-head misalignment; studio reverb or naturally decaying reverb is a prime example. As a waveform decays in a large room, it naturally changes phase. In Auto Center phase, this is (generally) shown as the upper frequencies making a drastic change. Tape head misalignment (azimuth) also will cause a phase change in upper frequencies. One {{should be aware of}} this when attempting to remove Haeco processing and not use auto-phase options. <b>Azimuth</b> <b>alignment</b> adjustment tools can however be used AFTER Haeco has been removed.|$|E

In {{the process}} of {{inertial}} alignment for an strapdowm inertial navigation system(SINS) on stationary base, the azimuth error’s poor observability leads to its long alignment time. In order to solve the problem,the paper considers inertial alignment as an optimizing process with the application of improved artificial fish swarm algorithm. Simulation results show that improved artificial fish swarm algorithm has rapidly,global and local optimizing characteristics. After applicating on SINS initial alignment,alignment accuracy is almost {{the same as the}} limited precision,however,the <b>azimuth</b> <b>alignment</b> times are greatly reduced...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{concerns}} have emerged regarding interferometry with TOPS, {{since it has}} been stated that a highly accurate <b>azimuth</b> <b>alignment</b> is needed to avoid phase bias in the interferometric phase. However, one should distinguish between effects due to limited geometric accuracy related to the static scene (e. g., orbit or DEM), and geophysical signals (actual azimuth displacements), which might give rise to legitimate phase jumps at the border between subsequent bursts. This paper addresses this topic and suggests an alternative methodology to process and interpret TOPS interferograms of non-stationary scenarios...|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the fact}} that MEMS-IMU has the {{advantages}} of small size, low cost, low power consumption, high reliability and convenient batch production, it has been widely applied to engineering fields and has become an important developing direction for inertial navigation system (Groves 2013; Noureldin et al. 2013). However, the gyro has a poor precision and is unable to complete the <b>azimuth</b> angle <b>alignment</b> independently, which needs other sensors to assist the initial alignment. In recent years, integrated alignment method has been applied gradually, which includes GPS, magnetometer, odometer, IMU and other sensors (Georgy et al., 2011; Ali and Elsheimy, 2013; Chang et al. 2017). With the development of multi-sensor information fusion techniques, MIMU/GPS/magnetometer integrated navigation system has been widely used in navigation and positioning, which could improve the initial alignment accuracy effectively (Khoder and Jida, 2014). However, magnetometer often causes observation outliers for it is highly susceptible to abnormal interference of unknown magnetic field (Zhou et al. 2016), the influence of GPS receiver signal occlusion (Teng et al. 2011), and the multi-path effect (Azarbad and Mosavi, 2014), which may produce observation outliers and result in large errors in initial alignment.|$|R
40|$|The on-orbit {{alignment}} of the antenna beams of both the X-band and C-band radar systems during operations of the shuttle radar topography mission/X-band synthetic aperture radar (SRTM/X-SAR) was a key requirement for achieving best interferometric performance. In this paper, we consider the X-SAR antenna beam <b>alignment</b> in <b>azimuth.</b> For a single-pass cross-track SAR interferometer, we establish the relation between yaw and pitch mis{{alignment of}} the antenna beams and the resulting relative shift of the Doppler frequency bands. This relation is used to provide solutions for the mechanical adjustments of the outboard antenna and electronic beam steering to correct for azimuth misalignment. Furthermore, {{the effects of the}} X-SAR effective outboard antenna pattern on the <b>azimuth</b> beam <b>alignment</b> are analyzed. As a result, a so-called "relaxing" factor is derived, which increases the limit for the difference in antenna azimuth angle with respect to the requirement on spectral overlap, and hence spatial interferogram resolution. However, we also show that the alignment requirement is driven by the constraint on decreasing the azimuth ambiguity-to-signal ratio (AASR) for the effective outboard antenna pattern to reduce the resulting additional height error. The strategy for misalignment determination and correction is presented, and results of the analysis of the in-flight X-SAR antenna beam alignment are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Solar chromospheric fibrils, as {{observed}} {{in the core of}} strong chromospheric spectral lines, extend from photospheric field concentrations suggesting that they trace magnetic field lines. These images have been historically used as proxies of magnetic fields for many purposes. We use a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze several tens of thousands of pixels in spectro-polarimetric chromospheric images of penumbrae and chromospheric fibrils. We compare the alignment between the field azimuth inferred from the linear polarization signals through the transverse Zeeman effect and the direction of the fibrils in the image. We conclude that, in the analyzed fields of view, fibrils are often well aligned with the magnetic field <b>azimuth.</b> Despite this <b>alignment,</b> the analysis also shows that there is a non-negligible dispersion. In penumbral filaments, we find a dispersion {{with a standard deviation of}} ~ 16 degrees, while this dispersion goes up to ~ 34 degrees in less magnetized regions.

40|$|The STRAP IV {{attitude}} control system was designed, tested, and successfully launched to provide stable high accuracy pointing at nontrackable X-ray sources. On its initial flight (May 19, 1972), the STRAP IV control system updated its high accuracy, rate integrating gyros on two successive stellar targets and then maneuvered the rocket body to point the experimental payload at two separate X-ray sources and an X-ray-free background location. The third axis, which remained {{under the control of}} a coarse free gyro, was updated by a technique of successive star-target coordinate transformation to ensure the correct fine-axis <b>azimuth</b> <b>alignment</b> for the high accuracy inertial maneuvers. Pointing accuracies of 4 arc min with limit cycle stability of less than 20 arc sec peak to peak were obtained on all targets...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- An {{alternative}} {{solution to the}} velocity based self-alignment of strapdown inertial navigation system is proposed. It {{is well known that}} a simple Kalman filter based solution to the above problem fails to provide accurate <b>azimuth</b> <b>alignment</b> due to the inherent lack of observability of the model in the presence of instrument bias. Earlier researchers use external digital filters to obtain improved estimation of selected states and substitute these into the filter. The current paper demonstrates that a simple augmentation of the output vector with the inertial measurement unit signals and an extended Kalman filter would yield similar or better alignment performance compared to such ad hoc additional digital filters. The proposed method improves the convergence rate of azimuth attitude error even in the presence of gyro bias and makes it relatively independent of the gyro noise. Results of comparative performance of the two filters using Monte Carlo simulation have been provided...|$|E
40|$|During Centaur launch {{operations}} {{the launch}} azimuth of the inertial platform's U-accelerometer input axis must be accurately established and maintained. This {{is accomplished by}} using an optically closed loop system with a long-range autotheodolite whose line of sight was established by a first-order survey. A collimated light beam from the autotheodolite intercepts a reflecting Porro prism mounted on the platform azimuth gimbal. Thus, any deviation of the Porro prism from its predetermined heading is optically detected by the autotheodolite. The error signal produced is used to torque the azimuth gimbal back to its required launch azimuth. The heading of the U-accelerometer input axis is therefore maintained automatically. Previously, the autotheodolite system could not distinguish between vehicle sway and rotational motion of the inertial platform unless at least three prisms were used. One prism was mounted on the inertial platform to maintain <b>azimuth</b> <b>alignment,</b> and two prisms were mounted externally on the vehicle to track sway. For example, the automatic azimuth-laying theodolite (AALT-SV-M 2) on the Saturn vehilce used three prisms. The results of testing and modifying the AALT-SV-M 2 autotheodolite to simultaneously monitor and maintain alignment of the inertial platform and track the sway of the vehicle from a single Porro prism...|$|E
40|$|High spatial {{resolution}} imagery and large apertures {{go hand in}} hand but small satellite volume constraints place a direct limit on monolithic aperture mirror systems. Deployable optical systems hold promise of overcoming aperture size constraints and greatly enhancing small satellite imaging capabilities. The Space Dynamics Laboratory (SDL) is currently researching deployable optics suitable for small spacecraft and has developed a passively aligned deployable mirror. The team recently built a proof-of-principle mirror and a single parabolic mirror segment or “petal” measured for deployment repeatability. They measured elevation (tilt) and <b>azimuth</b> (tip) angular <b>alignment</b> repeatability to be 0. 6 arcseconds or 2. 9 μrad (1 sigma) in each axis after a ten deployment sequence. The SDL team used optical modeling to study the effects of these alignment errors on a multiple petal parabolic primary mirror part of a Cassegrain imaging system. The model indicates that excellent image quality is possible in the short wave infrared (SWIR) to long wave infrared (LWIR) bands. Work continues on a four segment deployable primary mirror with an aperture diameter of 152 mm. The goal is to fabricate the mirror segments and demonstrate repeatable interferometric wavefront error measurements...|$|R
