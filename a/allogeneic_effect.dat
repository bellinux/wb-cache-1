40|$|The <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect</b> {{has been}} shown to replace the {{requirement}} for carrier-specific helper thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes in secondary antihapten antibody responses in guinea pigs or mice. Attempts to enhance primary antibody responses to either 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl (DNP) -keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) or DNP-ovalbumin (OVA) by the <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect</b> have failed, and frequently result in suppression. However, the present studies have demonstrated a clear <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect</b> on primary anti-DNP responses to a DNP-conjugate of the copolymer of D-glutamic acid and D-lysine, DNP-D-GL. This compound, for which no carrier-specific helper T cells exist, normally induces a state of DNP-specific tolerance in the doses employed. However, normal (BALB/c x A/J) F 1 recipients developed primary anti-DNP antibody responses, and of the IgG class, when DNP-D-GL was administered shortly after the transfer of allogeneic parental A strain lymphoid cells. To test the possibility that the presence of KLH-specific T lymphocytes might inhibit the expression of the <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect</b> on the primary response to DNP-KLH, studies were undertaken using T cell-depleted spleen cells. In this model, the <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect</b> again enhanced the primary response to DNP-D-GL, but still failed to enhance the primary response to DNP-KLH. These studies indicate that the structure of the molecule employed and its specific interaction with the bone marrow-derived (B) cell membrane may be critical in the capacity of primed and unprimed B cells to be influenced by the <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|E

This finding places great restrictions on model systems used to study the possibility of cooperative interactions between carrier-primed T and hapten-specific B lymphocytes of differing histocompatibilities. For brevity, we will again refer to antigen-specific cell interactions as "physiologic " T-B cell cooperation, contrasting with the <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect.</b> In this report, we describe appropriate in vivo and in vitro experimental protocols designed to study physiologic cooperation between histoincompatible T and B cells under conditions that avoid the <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect.</b> These results provide unequivocal proof that totally histoincompatible carrier-primed T lymphocytes fail to provide the required stimulus for the responses of B cells to hapten-carrier conjugates, whereas semiallogeneic T and B cells are capable of interacting effectively in the normal manner, and effect physiologic cooperatio...|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} noted marked {{differences between the}} in vitro responses of human B lymphocytes to stimulation with soluble antigens vs. stimulation with mitogens. In the present study, these differences were analyzed {{in terms of the}} precursor frequencies for the T cells and B cells involved {{and in terms of the}} radiation sensitivity of the T cells providing help in the two systems. Marked differences were found between antigen-induced and mitogen-induced systems with regard to T cell precursor frequencies and radiation sensitivity. In contrast, the precursor frequencies for the B cells involved in the two systems were approximately the same. In addition, having developed a system for the study of human antigen-specific B cell responses, we were interested in delineating the nature of the <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effects</b> that might be operative in this system. Marked <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effects,</b> both positive and negative, were noted in this system and will need to be taken into account in any studies that try to address the question of the genetic restriction, if any, that exists in human antigen-specific T cell-B cell collaboration.

40|$|T cells primed {{in mixed}} {{lymphocyte}} culture exert {{both positive and}} negative <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effects</b> on B cells expressing the appropriate alloantigens. The positive and negative effects can be separated by limiting dilution analysis: positive effects, measured by production of anti-sheep erythrocyte antibody, are revealed when low numbers of primed T cells are added to cultures of B cells and sheep erythrocytes, while suppression of the response occurs at higher T-cell inputs. In the present report, these negative <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effects</b> have been analysed in detail. Suppression was qualitatively and quantitatively similar when helper T cell activity was provided from any of several sources. Helper T cells in the alloantigen-primed population gave rise to active T-cell replacing factors even under conditions in which all microcultures were suppressed and suppressor cells were present at a high multiplicity in every well. The degree of suppression was influenced by the multiplicity of B cells in culture; as the number of B cells increased, more suppressor cells were required to inactivate a microculture. Taken together, these data indicate that the targets of the suppressor cells are B cells and not helper T cells or T-cell replacing factors. Although suppressor cells can prevent the activation of B cells by the more frequent helper cells in the primed T-cell population, detailed analysis of the stoichiometry of the suppression demonstrated that a single suppressor cell is capable of inactivating {{only a limited number of}} B cells, suggesting that a 'ratio-dominance' model of suppression is operative in this system...|$|R
40|$|Specific {{antibody}} {{responses to}} influenza virus were obtained in vitro from human blood mononuclear cells (PBM). The addition of allogeneic T cells to responding PBM profoundly suppressed antigen-induced antibody responses, {{but had no}} effect on pokeweed mitogen (PWM) -induced polyclonal Ig formation. This raised the possibility that suppression by allogeneic T cells may result from the activation of antigen- specific T suppressor (Ts) cells rather than nonspecific <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effects.</b> The frequency of allogeneic Ts in PBM from a number of different donors, estimated in a series of limiting dilution analyses, was found to range from 0. 8 X 10 (- 5) to 4. 5 X 10 (- 5), which is more typical of antigen-specific than alloreactive T cells. By adding limiting numbers of allogeneic T cells to antibody-forming cultures stimulated simultaneously with two non-cross-reacting antigens (influenza A and B strain viruses A/X 31 and B/HK), it was possible to demonstrate suppression of the response to one antigen, but not the other, in the same culture well. Moreover, the frequency of wells in which the response to both antigens was suppressed was not significantly different from that predicted from the calculated frequency of specific allogeneic Ts. These results show that allogeneic suppression was antigen specific, and was not due to non-specific <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effects.</b> By separating T cell preparations into Leu- 3 a+ (helper) and Leu- 2 a+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) T cell subsets, suppression was shown to be mediated by a radiosensitive Leu- 2 a+ T cell. The removal of Leu- 2 a+ cells from T cell preparations abrogated the suppressor effect and permitted T cell collaboration with B cells, across an HLA-A, -B, and -DR barrier. This result shows that in at least some combinations, suppression rather than major histocompatibility complex restriction is the reason for the failure of allogeneic T and B cells to collaborate in T cell-dependent antibody responses...|$|R

40|$|Allospecific mouse T cells, {{positively}} {{selected in}} one-way mixed lymphocyte culture were maintained for 3 yr in tissue culture by sequential restimulation. Such proliferating T cells were tested {{for their ability}} to induce a positive allogeneic effect: activating B cells in an in vitro primary humoral response to sheep erythrocytes. It was found that such T lymphocytes could function as helper cells. Helper activity was shown to be specific in that the B cells activated had to share major histocompatibility complex (H- 2) antigens with the strain used for selection of the cell line. Intra H- 2 mapping showed that antigens coded in the IAk subregion {{played an important role in}} the induction of the positive <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect.</b> Supernatant factors could substitute for the allogeneic T cells in activation of the in vitro humoral response. However, such supernates exhibited no strain specificity.

Suppression arising from <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effects</b> between the host and the transferred T or B cells was excluded by the use of tolerant as well as normal adoptive recipients; both were functionally equivalent.

40|$|The role of antigen {{presenting}} {{cells in}} specific in-vitro antibody responses to influenza virus by human lymphocytes was investigated. Demonstration of {{a requirement for}} accessory cells necessitated vigorous depletion procedures. Accessory cells were removed by passage of mononuclear cells through a Sephadex G 10 column followed by separation of cells bearing antigens defined by the monoclonal antibodies OKM 1 and UCHM 1 by fluorescence-activated cell sorting or panning. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated in this way were unable to respond to influenza virus by antibody production in either round-bottom or flat-bottom culture wells. The response could be reconstituted by either irradiated plastic-adherent cells or G 10 non-adherent OKM 1 /UCHM 1 positive cells in both autologous or allogeneic (HLA-DR different) combinations.

40|$|The {{recognition}} by T cells of soluble antigen {{is one of}} the important steps in the initiation of immune response. Antigen recognition is a complex event and requires, in addition to immunocompetent T cells and antigen, a second cell type that can present antigen to the T cell in order for the T cell to be stimulated (1, 2). Such antigen-presenting cells must share selected regions of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1 with the responding T cells in order to efficiently present antigen (3, 4). Thus, immune T cells are restricted by MHC determinants expressed on antigen-presenting cells as well as by antigen specificity. To study immunocompetent cellular interactions in depth, precise characterization of such restricting determinants is essential. Clones of antigen-reactive T cells derived from murine systems have provided powerful tools for analyzing the nature of restricting determinants expressed on antigen-presenting cells. These clones of antigen-reactive cells have allowed us to examine the restricting determinants in the absence of effects of contaminant cells that might exert inhibitory or nonspecific <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effects.</b> In a previous paper, w...|$|R
40|$|Responses to the {{synthetic}} terpolymer L-glutamic acid, L-lysine, L-tyrosine (GLT) in the mouse {{are controlled by}} H- 2 - 1 inked Ir-GLTgenes. (Responder × nonresponder) F(1) hybrid mice, themselves phenotypic responders, can be primed with GLT to develop specific helper cells capable of interacting with 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl hapten (DNP) -primed F(1) B cells in response to DNP-GLT. Unlike the indiscriminant ability of F(1) helper T cells for conventional antigens (i. e. not Ir gene-controlled), which can help B cells of either parental type (as well as F(1)) equally well, GLT-primed F(1) T cells can only provide help under normal circumstances for B lymphocytes of responder parent origin; {{they are unable to}} communicate effectively with nonresponder parental B cells (1, and the present studies). The present studies reveal, however, that the induction of a parental cell-induced <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect</b> during priming of F(1) mice to GLT actually dictates the direction of cooperating preference that will be displayed by such F(1) helper cells for B cells of one parental type or the other. Thus, F(1) T cells, primed to GLT under the influence of an <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect</b> induced by parental BALB/c cells, develop into effective helpers for nonresponder A/J B cells, but fail to develop effective helpers for responder BALB/c B cells, and vice-versa. In contrast, F(1) T cells, primed to GLT under the influence of an <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect</b> induced by either parental type, display significantly enhanced levels of helper activity for B cells derived from F(1) donors. These results are interpreted to reflect the existence of two interdependent events provoked by the allogeneic effect: one event augments the differentiation of GLT-specific helper T cells belonging to the subset corresponding to the opposite parental type; this would explain the development of increased helper activity provided to partner B cells of opposite parental type (as well as of F(1) origin). The second event, we postulate, involves the production of responses against the receptors which normally self-recognize native cell interaction determinants; this form of anti-idiotype response is restricted against self- recognizing receptors of the same parental type used for induction of the <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect,</b> hence explaining diminished helper activity of such F(1) cells for partner B lymphocytes of corresponding parental type...|$|E

This "allogeneic effect" has been demonstrated to result from the capacity of residual, apparently radioresistant, T cells in the irradiated host to exert an active effect on the transferred histoincompatible B lymphocytes. This conclusion derives from two corroborative experiments.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} framework is presented which explores two models of suppressor cell-target cell interactions in T-dependent antibody responses. The {{first is the}} full-dominance model, in which a single or limited number of suppressor cells can entirely suppress an immune response irrespective of the multiplicity of other effector cells present. The second is the ratio-dominance model, in which a suppressor cell is capable of inactivating only {{a certain number of}} target cells. Thus, the multiplicity of target cells in a given microculture well influences the degree of suppression. Both models are evaluated using limiting dilution analysis and two systems are explored. In the first model, suppressor cells alone are titrated into microculture wells containing all other cells required for an immune response. In the second, suppressor cells are added from populations containing a mixture of helper T cells as well as suppressor cells. This latter type of analysis is similar to that in which populations of T cells primed to alloantigens in mixed lymphocyte cultures are analysed for positive (help) and negative (suppression) <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effects.</b> The analysis allows us to conclude that such suppressor cells operate via a mechanism best described by a ratio-dominance model...|$|R

Pilarski (5) reported that the interaction between unprimed peripheral Th cells and CTL. P from the thymus occurred between allogeneic as well as syngeneic T cells, as long as both could respond to stimulator alloantigens.

Thus, spleen cells from DNP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) -primed mice manifest good secondary anti-DNP responses to a challenge with DNP-KLH, but not with DNP-bovine gamma globulin (BGG), after adoptive transfer to irradiated syngeneic recipients. However, a good adoptive transfer secondary anti-DNP response of such cells can be elicited with DNP-BGG when a second transfer of allogeneic lymphoid cells, in appropriate numbers, is carried out 24 hr before secondary challenge. The advantage to this system is that the DNP-primed cell population {{as well as the}} population of allogeneic lymphoid cells are accessible to experimental manipulation such that the T lymphocytes of one or the other can be removed. Utilizing this model, we have established that the <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect</b> on antibody production can operate on a population of primed B lymphocytes which have been depleted of their isologous T lymphocytes by in vitro incubation with anti-θ serum plus complement.

40|$|Since the {{description}} of the in vivo <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect</b> in inbred guinea pigs (1 - 3) and more recent extension of the system to inbred mice (4 - 7), considerable attention has been focused on this phenomenon as a model of the regulatory mechanisms of activated T lymphocytes on immune responses in vivo (for reviews, see references 8 and 9). The <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect,</b> as first described, demonstrated that the transfer of allogeneic immunocompetent lymphoid cells to animals previously primed with a hapten-carrier conjugate, such as 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl (DNP) -keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), 1 markedly enhanced the antihapten antibody response to an appropriately timed secondary challenge with that hapten coupled to an unrelated carrier. This phenomenon has been shown to require the initiation of an active graft-vs. -host (GVH) reaction in the lymphoid tissues of the primed host (1) and to reflect the direct interaction of donor T lymphocytes recognizing foreign histocompatibility determinants on primed host B lymphocytes, irrespective of the presence of host T cells (5).

Furthermore, the transfer of allogeneic cells prepares DNP-OVA-primed recipients for a striking secondary anti-DNP response to DNP-BGG; this occurs in equal degree whether or not the cells are derived from BGG-primed donors. We suggest that the allogeneic cells function by virtue of a specific immunologic attack of grafted cells on host cells. This conclusion is made on the basis of the following evidence: (a) The failure of observing the phenomenon with L 2 C leukemia cells and irradiated strain 2 lymph node and spleen cells which, although capable of initiating a host-versus-graft response, are incapable of mediating graft-versus-host reactions; and (b) the inability of (strain 2 x strain 13) F 1 hybrids to mediate the <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect</b> in strain 13 recipients.

40|$|Suppressor T (Ts) 1 {{cells are}} known to be {{involved}} in the regulation of most immune responses, including antibody production (1, 2), delayed-type hypersensitivity (3), cytotoxicity (4), and responses to mitogens (5). In addition, Ts activated by antigens coded for by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (aliogeneic Ts) have been found to be important in the regulation of various allogeneic responses. Thus, allogeneic Ts {{are known to}} inhibit mixed lymphocyte responses (6) and, in vivo, they are probably responsible for the loss of immune competence in animals undergoing graft-vs. -host (GvH) reactions (7, 8). Similarly, allogeneic Ts activated in pregnancy inhibit the generation of cytotoxic T cells (CTL) to paternal antigens and may be important for maternal tolerance of the fetus (9, 10). One of the more successful means for studying allogeneic suppression has been the potent inhibition of in vitro antibody responses by histoincompatible T cells (11, 12). With this model, allogeneic Ts in both mouse and man have been shown to be radiosensitive T cells belonging to the suppressor/cytotoxic subset with the surface phenotype Ly-l+ 2 ÷ and Leu- 2 a ÷, respectively (11, 13 - 16). They are, therefore, distinct from T cells mediating positive <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effects</b> that are radioresistant and Ly-l+ 2 - (17).

40|$|The studies {{presented}} here {{have focused on}} the important question of reversibility of inactivation of DNP-specific B lymphocytes induced by the DNP derivative of the copolymer of D-glutamic acid and D-lysine (D-GL). In so doing, we have analyzed the capacity of a strong T-cell stimulus, such as that provided by the <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect,</b> and of gentle enzymatic treatment with trypsin to alter, prevent, or reverse the tolerance induced by DNP-D-GL. Under experimental conditions in which DNP-specific B lymphocytes were exposed first to the tolerogenic molecule, and rendered markedly unresponsive by such exposure either in vitro or in vivo, subsequent exposure to an <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect</b> failed to appreciably reverse or alter the tolerant state. This contrasts directly with the capacity of DNP-D-GL to serve as a stimulus for DNP-specific B lymphocytes when the critical moment of specific binding occurs subsequent to the development of an <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect.</b> In another series of experiments, the effects of enzymatic treatment with trypsin on the tolerant B-cell population were found to vary depending on the stage of tolerance at which such treatment was performed. Thus, when exposure of cells to DNP-D-GL for a relatively short time in vitro is carried out at low temperature (4 °C), the development of tolerance can be interceded by immediate trypsinization. In contrast, cells exposed to DNP-D-GL {{for longer periods of time}} and/or at 37 °C were not reversed to responsiveness by trypsinization. These data were interpreted to indicate that: (a) the effect(s) of trypsin in reversing (or preventing) tolerance at the cellular level does not depend necessarily on the susceptibility of the tolerogenic moiety to the action of the enzyme, and (b) the generation of the tolerance-inducing signal involves metabolic cellular processes that can be delayed somewhat by low temperature leaving such cells relatively more susceptible to intercedent manipulations such as trypsinization. Taken collectively, therefore, the evidence obtained in these studies reinforces the concept of central tolerance in B cells induced by DNP-D-GL as reflecting sub- or intracellular inactivating events...|$|E

Thus, the phenomenon requires the existence of an active graft-versus-host (GVH) 1 reaction in which the primed B lymphocytes are those of the host cell population. The occurrence of a host rejection reaction is not only not required, but also appears to play little, if any, role (1, 3). This suggests that, by direct action on primed B cells, the <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect</b> obviates entirely the need for the interaction between isologous T and B lymphocytes specific for the challenging conjugate, or, alternatively, enhances the functional effectiveness of the small number of isologous T cells specific for the second carrier. To approach this issue directly requires a system in which both cell populations, i. e. the 2, 4 -dinotrophenyl (DNP) -primed population and a population of allogeneic lymphoid cells, are accessible to experimental manipulation such that the T lymphocytes of one or the other can be selectively removed.

40|$|These {{studies were}} carried out to {{investigate}} the potential helper T cell repertoire specific for the random copolymer poly(L-Glu 55,L-Ala 35, L-Phe 9) n(GL phi 9) of responder, nonresponder, and (responder x nonresponder) F 1 murine strains. We tested the ability of these T cells to collaborate with dinitrophenyl (DNP) -specific primary and secondary B lymphocytes of each strain in response to the antigen CNP-GL phi 9 in the splenic-fragment culture system. The results of these experiments show that there are GL phi 9 -specific T lymphocytes in the responder, nonresponder, and F 1 strains; but that these three GL phi 9 -specific T cell populations differ in their collaborative potential. Responder T cells are able to collaborate with their own syngeneic responder B cells as well as the allogeneic nonresponder B cells in a syngeneic fashion. The F 1 T cell population resembles that of the nonresponder in its ability to collaborate with only responder B cells in a syngeneic fashion. Analysis carried out using appropriately selected mouse strains indicate that these results are unlikely to be a result of positive or negative <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effects.</b> The results obtained suggest that individuals within a given murine strain do possess the capacity to collaborate in a syngeneic fashion with B cells of any other MHC- allogeneic strain as well as their own MHC-identical B cells. The nonresponder status in the response to GL phi 9 appears {{to be the result of}} a deletion of T cells capable of recognizing antigen in the context of B cells of the nonresponder haplotype. Thus, the MHC gene products appear to play a determinative role in shaping the expressed helper T cell specificity repertoire within an individual mouse strain...|$|R

To evaluate the potential benefit from transient post-allo-SCT alloreactivity, we {{took advantage of the}} Société Française de Greffe de Moëlle et Thérapie Cellulaire (SFGM-TC) registry to colligate 14 patients with an efficient and long-lasting <b>allogeneic</b> (GVL) <b>effect</b> after allo-SCT for haematological malignancies, despite transient or absent engraftment. None received a second allogeneic graft after autologous recovery. The median duration of remission after autologous reconstitution was 118 (12 - 252) months. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that some patients were cured before allo-SCT, this retrospective analysis does strongly suggest that an efficient GVL effect can be observed without sustained donor engraftment, and that the transient presence of donor T cells might be sufficient to induce a powerful GVL effect...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the antigenic requirements for restimulation of H- 2 - restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) in vitro {{to determine whether}} H- 2 I region-restricted helper T cells are required in these responses. In one set of experiments, we studied the in vitro response of (responder x nonresponder) F(1) female T cells to the male antigen H-Y. We chose to examine this response {{because it has been}} suggested that the defect in nonresponder strains is a failure of helper T cells to recognize H-Y in association with nonresponder I region determinants. However, we find that nonresponder male stimulator cells are as effective as F(1) male stimulator cells at inducing H-Y-specific CTL responses. This finding calls into question reports that secondary CTL responses to H-Y are dependent upon the activation of H-Y- specific helper T cells restricted to responder type I region determinants. In a second set of experiments, we examined the requirements for restimulation of H- 2 -restricted T cells specific for minor-histocompatibility antigens from long-term mixed lymphocyte cultures. These cultures were established by repeatedly restimulating cultures of specific T cells with H- 2 -matched stimulator cells expressing foreign minor histocompatibility antigens. We found that H- 2 D-restricted T ceils, including CTL, could be restimulated with cells that were matched with the responding cells at only the D region genes. This response did not appear to result from positive <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effects</b> or from antigen processing and “representation” by responder type APC that might contaminate the cultures. Thus, we find no evidence for a requirement for I region-restricted helper T cells in these CTL responses. However, helper T cells are required because we find that CTL lines derived by limit-dilution cloning from these long-term MLC are absolutely dependent upon exogenous helper factors for growth. The most simple interpretation of these results is that the helper cells are restricted to H- 2 antigens other than I region antigens or to antigens that code outside of the H- 2 complex. Finally, we show that factor-dependent CTL lines must recognize their specific antigen to proliferate, even in the presence of exogenous factors. The requirement of activated CTL for antigen to proliferate provides an explanation for how specific CTL can be selectively enriched in MLC by specific antigen stimulation. Furthermore, it is at variance with reports that memory CTL or activated CTL require only interleukin 2 for restimulation...|$|R

The results showed that whereas gammaM PFC arose on the 3 rd d after immunization, gamma 1 -, gamma 2 -, and gammaA-secreting PFC arose on the 4 th to 5 th d after immunization. They appeared in association with gammaM-secreting PFC because they were detected with the gammaM blocking method but not with the sequential method. By the 7 th d most gamma 1, gamma 2, and gammaA PFC were detected by the sequential method as well, indicating that those antibodies were secreted independently of cells secreting gammaM. When the numbers of double-class-secreting PFC were evaluated on the 5 th d, the following results were obtained: 83 % of gammaM PFC were secreting either gamma 1 (25 %), gamma 2 (55 %), or gammaA (2 %). We interpret these data as evidence for an antigen-driven class differentiation from gammaM to gammaA and from gammaM to gammaG in the majority of anti-SSS- III-secreting clones without T-cell help. When an <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect</b> was provided by inoculation of parental BALB/c spleen cells together with antigen, the numbers of all classes of PFC were increased. Furthermore, the frequency of gammaM-gammaG (108 %) or gammaM-gammaA (9 %) double- class secretors was increased, and gammaM-independent gammaG and gammaA secretors were detected earlier, indicating an overall maturation- promoting effect. In addition, prolonged appearance of gammaA PFC was dependent on the <b>allogeneic</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{identified}} 19 {{persons with}} B-cell {{chronic lymphocytic leukemia}} (CLL) who received genetically identical twin blood cell or bone marrow transplants after high-dose conditioning. Ten are alive (eight disease-free) with a median follow-up of 89 months (range, 31 - 171 months); 5 -year relapse rate was 50 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 26 - 73 %). Estimated 5 -year survival and disease-free survival were 61 % (95 % CI, 37 - 82 %) and 45 % (95 % CI, 23 - 68 %). In two of four patients tested at 12 and 21 months by polymerase chain reaction no evidence of residual CLL was detected post-transplant. In one recipient who relapsed at 6 years, molecular studies showed a different CLL clone from that detected pretransplant. This clone was subsequently identified in the donor suggesting transfer of occult leukemia {{at the time of}} transplant. Genetically identical twin transplants can result in long-term disease-free survival and molecular remissions, these data suggest the potential for CLL control in the absence of <b>allogeneic</b> graft-versus-leukemia <b>effect.</b> The case of leukemia transfer indicates the need for careful evaluation of donors prior to graft collection.

40|$|W 3 / 25 {{antibody}} is the monoclonal {{product of}} a hybrid cell resulting from the fusion of a mouse myeloma cell line with spleen cells from a mouse immunized with rat thymocytes. Pure clones have been derived, and segregants free of parental myeloma chains have been isolated. Previous {{studies have shown that}} this antibody recognizes a subpopulation of T cells among rat thoracic duct lymphocytes. In the work reported here, three T-cell functions were assayed after separating rat thoracic duct lymphocytes on the fluorescence-activated cell sorter on the basis of labeling with W 3 / 25 antibody. Two of the functional activities appeared to be completely segregated by this procedure. Thus, helper cell activity for an anti-hapten plaque-forming cell response was confined to the labeled population, whereas the <b>allogeneic</b> suppressive <b>effect</b> produced in a parental vector F 1 adoptive transfer was mediated by cells in the unlabeled fraction. The third function, graft-versus-host activity, was almost entirely contained within the labeled subpopulation.

40|$|These {{experiments}} explored {{mechanisms of}} control of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using a murine model of MHC-matched, minor histocompatibility antigen–mismatched transplantation. The central hypothesis examined was that addition of active vaccination against leukemia cells would substantially increase the effectiveness of allogeneic donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) against ALL present in the host after transplantation. Although vaccination did increase the magnitude of type I T cell responses against leukemia cells associated with DLI, it {{did not lead to}} substantial improvement in long-term survival. Analysis of immunologic mechanisms of leukemia progression demonstrated that the failure of vaccination was not because of antigen loss in leukemia cells. However, analysis of survival provided surprising findings that, in addition to very modest type I T cell responses, a B cell response that produced antibodies that bind leukemia cells was found in long-term survivors. The risk of death from leukemia was significantly lower in recipients that had higher levels of such antibodies. These studies raise the hypothesis that stimulation of B cell responses after transplantation may provide a novel way to enhance <b>allogeneic</b> graft-versus-leukemia <b>effects</b> associated with transplantation...|$|R
