30|$|China thus is {{a society}} where {{economic}} growth has materially benefited from all strata of society. Perhaps {{a combination of both}} one’s <b>absolute</b> <b>standard</b> of living and the perception of one’s place in the income distribution, which includes the possibility that the perception is accurate, together define a belief in middle class identity. At any rate, it seems that at least in China, achieving a particular <b>absolute</b> <b>standard</b> of living is not sufficient to consider oneself middle class.|$|R
30|$|Centering {{decreases}} the <b>absolute</b> <b>standard</b> deviations of the extracted components. Yet the variance percentages {{of the higher}} order components increase substantially. This signifies that important amounts of the initial variation are redistributed among the higher order components 2, 3 and 4. On the contrary, performing the analysis without centering results in higher <b>absolute</b> <b>standard</b> deviations. Nonetheless, the variance percentages of the higher order components are substantially reduced {{in comparison to the}} 1 st component. We then observe that centering relocates a lot of the information included in postfire band 2 in the 2 nd component (eigenvector increases from 0.53 in case A to 0.73 in case C).|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we compare a {{competency}} system based on an <b>absolute</b> <b>standard</b> vs. a competitive grading system (tournament) {{in terms of the}} student effort level they are able to motivate. We prove, unlike other previous work, that more risk does not always discourage effort under a competency grading system. Furthermore, relative advantage depends crucially {{on the nature of the}} noise distorting academic achievement. If systematic factors prevail then a tournament is preferred to a competency system based on <b>absolute</b> <b>standards,</b> while if idiosyncratic factors predominate the last is more efficient. Comparisons are effective only and only if the passing standard is fixed at the efficient level that promotes in the student the highest optimal effort. ...|$|R

60|$|Verification of Instruments.--On {{arriving}} at the sea-level, make daily observations with your boiling-point thermometer, barometer, and aneroid, as they are all subject to changes in their index-errors. As soon as you have an opportunity, compare them with a <b>standard</b> <b>barometer,</b> compare also your ordinary thermometer and azimuth-compass with standard instruments, and finally, have them carefully re-verified at the Kew observatory on your return to England. A vast deal of labour has been wholly thrown away by travellers owing to their neglecting to ascertain the index-errors of these instruments {{at the close of}} their journey. A careful observer ought to have eliminated the effects of instrumental errors from his sextant observations; nevertheless it will be satisfactory to him, and it may clear up some apparent anomalies, to have his entire instrumental outfit re-verified at Kew.|$|R

Bloom suggest that the using <b>absolute</b> <b>standards</b> rather than competitive criteria, help students to collaborate and facilitates mastery.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- A {{series of}} {{experiments}} {{with a variety of}} teaching methodologies was conducted in a number of engineering science classes over a period of 2 years. These experiments included incorporating active learning into the classroom through reduced lecture time and more in-class problem solving by students, assigning open-ended problems with each homework assignment, cooperative learning through team homework assignments, team in-class problems, allowing students to work examinations in pairs, and grading with an <b>absolute</b> <b>standard</b> instead of a mixed absolute/relative standard. Following each experiment, student opinions were surveyed. Students preferred active learning in classes (less lecture) and working assignments in teams. Students had mixed feelings on working exams in pairs. The experiment of using an <b>absolute</b> grading <b>standard</b> convinced the author to continue with the mixed absolute/relative method previously employed...|$|R
40|$|The redox {{properties}} of monolayer-protected gold nanoclusters (MPCs) are considered {{from both the}} theoretical and experimental viewpoints. The “absolute standard redox potential ” ([EZ/Z- 10]abs) of MPCs is first derived from electrostatic considerations. A linear dependence of the <b>absolute</b> <b>standard</b> redox potential on the valence state of MPCs is theoretically predicted and verified experimentally. By employing ferricinium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) as a reference redox couple, the average valence state of MPCs at a given potential can be estimated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a discussion of}} Angovian methods of standard setting – methods which are widely used {{with the intent of}} defining criterion-referenced <b>absolute</b> <b>standards</b> for tests in medical education. Most practitioners, although purporting to pursue <b>absolute,</b> criterion-referenced <b>standards,</b> have unwittingly slipped into focussing on norm-referenced concepts of „borderline ‟ students and their predicted ability to answer assessment items in a test. This slippage has been facilitated by a shift in language from the original concept of „minimally acceptable ‟ persons to the modern concept of „borderline‟ persons. The inability of university academics to predict accurately the performance of „borderline ‟ graduate-entry medical students is illustrated by presentation of data obtained from three successive cohorts of a small regional medical school during the years 2010 - 2012. Other data are presented to show how student performance, both „borderline ‟ and general, can be significantly altered by switching fro...|$|R

40|$|Similarity or {{distance}} measures play {{an important}} role in various pattern recognition applications such as classification, clustering, change detection, information retrieval, energy minimization and optimization problems. We shall analyze theoretically the two most popular quality measures MSE and SSIM used in image processing by showing their origin, similarities/differences and advantages/drawbacks. Both measures depend on the same parameters: sample means, standard deviations and correlation coefficient.

Guilt cultures emphasize punishment and forgiveness as ways of restoring the moral order; shame cultures stress self-denial and humility as ways of restoring the social order.
