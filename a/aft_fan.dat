25|$|The Power Jets W.2/700 {{turbojet}} engine {{was intended to}} be the first powerplant for the M.52.

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{characteristics of}} a large scale V/STOL transport model powered by tip-turbine driven lift fans were investigated. The model had four fans; the forward fans were mounted in pods forward of the wing at midsemispan. The <b>aft</b> <b>fans</b> were placed in cruise nacelles behind and above the wing. A cascade of variable camber exit louvers was placed behind each of the lift-cruise fans to turn the fan flow in the lift direction for hover and transition to wing supported flight. The wing of the model was mounted above the fuselage, had an aspect ratio of 5. 8, sweepback of 35 deg at the quarter chord line and a taper ratio of 0. 3. Various configurations of the model were tested to explore the transition speed range. Fan performance, turning effectiveness of the variable camber exit louvers, longitudinal and lateral-directional characteristics with fan operation in crossflow are presented...|$|R

Reheat was later fight trialled in the W.2/700 engines in a Meteor I. The technique increased the Meteor's speed by 30-40mph.

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} turbofans was a derivative of the General Electric J79 turbojet, known as the CJ805-23, which featured an integrated aft fan/low-pressure (LP) turbine unit located in the turbojet exhaust jetpipe. Hot gas from the turbojet turbine exhaust expanded through the LP turbine, the fan blades being a radial extension of the turbine blades. This aft-fan configuration was later exploited in the General Electric GE-36 UDF (propfan) demonstrator of the early 80s. One {{of the problems with}} the <b>aft</b> <b>fan</b> configuration is hot gas leakage from the LP turbine to the fan.|$|E

50|$|As {{part of the}} {{development}} process, a smaller prototype called the Airbus E-Fan was built and flown in 2014. The first flight was from the company's facility in Bordeaux, France. The E-Fan is a composite, tandem two-seat low-wing aircraft. Two ducted fans are mounted {{on either side of}} its <b>aft</b> fuselage; each <b>fan</b> is driven by an electric motor of 30 kW maximum output. The batteries are lithium-ion type, sized to provide about 30 minutes of flight time.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is constructed}} from carbon (fiber)-composite.Two 770 liters air-conditioned cells on its sides {{are designed to}} receive stretchers and casualties. The cells will also have devices for transfusions during flight. Initial interior cabin noise was measured in hover at 95 decibels without any incorporated acoustic treatment or liners.An additional 1,100 liters are available in an optional belly mounted compartment. The fuselage forms an airfoil and generates over 50% of lift at high speed (US Patent # 7,806,362B2). An aerodynamic bulge between the ducted fans keeps the airflow attached to it, hence generating lift, while diverting the airflow into the <b>aft</b> <b>fan</b> for increased thrust.|$|E

50|$|The Garrett ATF3 (US {{military}} designation F104) is a 3-spool {{turbofan engine}} {{developed at the}} California division of Garrett AiResearch. Due to mergers it is currently supported by Honeywell Aerospace. The engine is unusual as the core flow path is twice reversed 180 deg. <b>Aft</b> of the <b>fan,</b> the axial compressor has five stages, after which the gas path progresses to the aft end of the engine. There, it is reversed 180 deg and flows through a centrifugal compressor stage, the combustors and then the turbine stages. Beyond this, the flow is then reversed 180 deg again to exit in the fan bypass duct. All engine accessories are mounted on the aft end of the engine under an engine tail-cone.|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been {{completed}} to quantify the contribution of fan broadband noise to advanced high bypass turbofan engine system noise levels. The result suggests that reducing fan broadband noise can produce 3 to 4 EPNdB in engine system noise reduction, once the fan tones are eliminated. Further, {{in conjunction with the}} elimination of fan tones and an increase in bypass ratio, a potential reduction of 7 to 10 EPNdB in system noise can be achieved. In addition, an initial assessment of engine broadband noise source mechanisms has been made, concluding that the dominant source of fan broadband noise is the interaction of incident inlet boundary layer turbulence with the fan rotor. This source has two contributors, i. e., unsteady life dipole response and steady loading quadrupole response. The quadrupole contribution was found {{to be the most important}} component, suggesting that broadband noise reduction can be achieved by the reduction of steady loading field-turbulence field quadrupole interaction. Finally, for a controlled experimental quantification and verification, the study recommends that further broadband noise tests be done on a simulated engine rig, such as the GE Aircraft Engine Universal Propulsion Simulator, rather than testing on an engine statically in an outdoor arena The rig should be capable of generating forward and <b>aft</b> propagating <b>fan</b> noise, and it needs to be tested in a large freejet or a wind tunnel...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. Within the {{compression}} system {{of a gas}} turbine engine {{a significant amount of}} air is removed to fulfil various requirements associated with cooling, ventilation and sealing. Flow is usually removed through off-takes located in regions where space is restricted, whilst the flow is highly complex containing blade wakes, secondary flows and other flow features. This paper investigates the performance of a pitot style off-take aimed at providing a high pressure recovery in a relatively short length. For this to be achieved some pre-diffusion of the flow is required upstream of the off-take (i. e. by making the off-take larger than the captured streamtube). Although applicable to a variety of applications, the system is targeted at an intercooled aero-engine concept where the off-take would be located <b>aft</b> of the <b>fan</b> Outlet Guide Vane (OGV) root and provide coolant flow to the heat exchangers. Measurements and numerical predictions are initially presented for a baseline configuration with no off-take present. This enabled the OGV near field region to be characterised and provided a datum, relative to which the effects of introducing an off-take could be assessed. With the off-take present a variety of configurations were investigated including different levels of pre-diffusion, prior to the off-take, and different off-take positions. For very compact systems of short length, such that the gap between the OGV and off-take is relatively small, the amount of pre-diffusion achievable is limited by the off-take pressure field {{and its impact on the}} upstream OGV row. This pressure field is also influenced by parameters such as the non-dimensional off-take height and splitter thickness. The paper analyses the relative importance of these various effects in order to provide some preliminary design rules. For systems of increased length a significant amount of flow pre-diffusion can be achieved with little performance penalty. However, the pre-diffusion level is eventually limited by the increased distortion and pressure losses associated with the captured streamtube...|$|R
50|$|The normal {{definition}} for the bypass ratio (BPR) of a turbofan engine is the ratio between the {{mass flow rate}} of the bypass stream to the mass flow rate entering the core. A 10:1 bypass ratio, for example, means that 10 kg of air passes through the bypass duct for every 1 kg of air passing through the core. Note that in an <b>aft</b> <b>fan</b> engine, like the General Electric CJ805-23, all of the fan air enters the bypass stream, whereas on most turbofans only the air entering the outer section of the fan passes to the bypass duct. Another special case is the General Electric TF39 {{where most of the}} fan air plus some of the low pressure compressor air enter the bypass duct.|$|E
5000|$|The unique {{feature of}} the -23 was the {{transonic}} single stage fan. [...] NACA had {{done a lot of}} research on multistage transonic compressors during the 50's. Using this data, GE decided to design and test a high pressure ratio single stage transonic fan. Much to their amazement the unit more than met the design target, including that of high efficiency. A modified version of this research unit was subsequently incorporated into the CJ805-23 <b>aft</b> <b>fan.</b> With no experience of transonic fan design and little time available, Pratt & Whitney had to resort to using 2 fan stages to produce a similar pressure ratio for their JT-3D turbofan. Although not an overhung design, the -23 transonic fan did not require any inlet guide vanes. There was, however, a series of structural vanes to help support the fan casing.|$|E
5000|$|The General Electric X353-5 was an unusual, high bypass ratio, liftfan system {{developed}} for the Ryan XV-5 Vertifan V/STOL research aircraft [...] (known earlier as the VZ-11). Two General Electric J85-5 turbojets were used for propulsion in wing-borne flight. During lift, the exhaust from these turbojets was diverted through ducting {{to a pair of}} vertically mounted turbine/fan units buried in the aircraft wings (one in the starboard wing, the other in the port wing). These turbine/fan units were similar in concept to the <b>aft</b> <b>fan</b> units on the General Electric CJ805 -23, the main difference being that the turbine blades of the X353-5 were outboard of the fan, rather than inboard. Each engine supplied half the exhaust gas needed to drive each fan unit. A cross-over duct kept both fans turning uniformly in the event of either engine failing. The aircraft also had a smaller turbine/fan mounted in the aircraft nose, which was used to control pitch. This pitch fan was similar in design to the main fan units and utilised 10.5% of the gas generator exhaust gas flow. Beneath each fan was a series of spanwise exit louvres, ganged together, which were used to vector the fan thrust in lift mode. Effectively, the bypass ratio was 12.16:1 in lift mode.|$|E
40|$|A TF- 34 engine with an {{acoustically treated}} ground test nacelle was built and tested to {{determine}} the feasibility of suppressing fan and core engine noise to the stringent levels required for STOL or short-haul commercial aircraft. The design incorporates wall treatment for the fan and core plus three treated splitter rings in the inlet and two treated splitters in the <b>aft</b> <b>fan</b> duct. Maximum suppression of fan tone noise of 40 - 45 dB was obtained from both the inlet and <b>aft</b> <b>fan</b> treatment. At rated fan speed, overall noise was reduced by 21 PNdB to a value of 94 PNdB on a 500 -foot sideline. The overall noise reduction value was limited by the jet noise floor. Thrust losses due to the acoustic treatment are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Aft</b> <b>fan</b> {{noise is}} {{becoming}} a more dominant source as engine bypass ratio is increased and improved methods are required for its control. Bypass liners are especially effective in attenuating <b>aft</b> <b>fan</b> noise, but, in recent papers we introduced {{the idea of using}} acoustic linings on external parts of the aero-engine nacelle, such as the afterbody and plug nozzle. We showed that when the afterbody is acoustically lined, it can reduces the far field broadband sound power by up to 3 dB in the absence of flow, an experimental result which was confirmed with calculations using a commercially available CAA code. In this paper, we extend the previous computations to include the effects of a two-stream coaxial flow using the same CAA code but with a new 1 D membrane element to represent the shear layers. The results, supported by two analytical models, confirm our expectations that the AL could also provide significant reductions in <b>aft</b> <b>fan</b> with flow. As anticipated the main flow effect is to refract the no-flow insertion loss to larger angles outside the cone of silence, with little or no benefits inside the cone of silence. However, it should be emphasised that although the results obtained so far are with a representative mean flow, the geometry is still idealized and these and other computations have to be validated with data from large-scale tests based on a fully realistic geometry and flow...|$|E

40|$|An {{approximately}} 0. 25 {{scale model}} of the transition section of a tandem fan variable cycle engine nacelle was tested in the NASA Lewis Research Center 10 -by- 10 foot wind tunnel. Two 12 -inch, tip-turbine driven fans were used to simulate a tandem fan engine. Three testing modes simulated a V/STOL tandem fan airplane. Parallel mode has two separate propulsion streams for maximum low speed performance. A front inlet, fan, and downward vectorable nozzle forms one stream. An auxilliary top inlet provides air to the <b>aft</b> <b>fan</b> - supplying the core engine and aft vectorable nozzle. Front nozzle and top inlet closure, and removal of a blocker door separating the two streams configures the tandem fan for series mode operations as a typical aircraft propulsion system. Transition mode operation is formed by intermediate settings of the front nozzle, blocker door, and top inlet. Emphasis was on the total pressure recovery and flow distortion at the <b>aft</b> <b>fan</b> face. A range of fan flow rates were tested at tunnel airspeeds from 0 to 240 knots, and angles-of-attack from - 10 to 40 deg for all three modes.

40|$|<b>Aft</b> <b>fan</b> {{noise is}} {{becoming}} a more dominant source as engine bypass ratio is increased and improved methods are for required for its control. Acoustic linings are {{an effective means of}} reducing internally generated noise and bypass liners are especially effective in attenuating <b>aft</b> <b>fan</b> noise. Previous calculations have shown that as the fan noise emerges from the bypass exhaust nozzle, {{a significant part of the}} sound field radiates directly out through the shear layer but there is also another propagation path, along which the sound field is first reflected from the hard âafterbodyâ before it propagates out to the far field. It has been suggested that if the afterbody were acoustically lined, it would reduce the strength of that reflected field and hence the far field noise level. Here we describe results from some preliminary tests on a rig, using scaled, locally reacting, linear SDOF acoustic linings to simulate the conventional, internal bypass liners and also the new external Afterbody Liner (AL). The measured data from this âNo-flowâ rig indicate that up to 3 dB PWL insertion loss can be achieved with an AL in addition to that achieved with conventional bypass liners. Calculations agree well with the measured PWL insertion loss spectrum although the measured SPL reductions are not so well predicted at some angles. This novel application of conventional liner technology to the external afterbody of an engine nacelle may provide some significant reductions in aft broadband fan noise levels although it should be emphasised that the results obtained so far are without flow...|$|E

Several {{studies have shown that}} residents in these areas experience problems such as stress and sleep disturbance.

As a result, large amounts of resources have been diverted towards the improvement of existing noise attenuation technologies and the development of more effective ones.
