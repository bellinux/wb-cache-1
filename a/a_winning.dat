5|$|Maddux {{made the}} most putouts in a season (39) three times in his career (1990, 1991, and 1993). The American League leader is Frank Lary, who made 32 putouts for the Detroit Tigers in 1961. Kaat is the leader in assists; he made 72 with the Minnesota Twins in 1962. The National League leader, Maddux, trails him by one (71 assists in 1996). Many {{pitchers}} have posted errorless seasons and 1.000 fielding percentages in their winning seasons; Mussina is the leader with four perfect seasons in the field. Guidry (19821984) and Mussina (19961998) both accomplished the feat in three consecutive seasons. The most double plays turned by <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> pitcher is nine, accomplished by Maddux in 2006. Four pitchers have also thrown no wild pitches in <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> season: Maddux (1997, 2006), Kaat (1975), Shantz (1961, 1962), and Rogers (2005). In contrast, the most wild pitches in <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> season is 18, by the knuckleballing Niekro. The fewest balks in <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> season is zero, achieved many times, but Maddux accomplished the feat the most time in his wins (12 balk-free seasons in 18 years). The most balks in <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> season is five, by Mike Norris in 1981 and Orel Hershiser in 1988. Langston picked off the most runners from the pitcher's mound in <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> season, with 10 in 1993; four pitchers are tied for the National League lead with 5 pickoffs. Rogers posted both the highest (100% in 2002) and lowest (0% in 2005) caught stealing percentage in <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> season. Shantz' 1961 season tied Rogers' 0% mark for lowest percentage caught, and three pitchers are tied for the National League lead (67% caught).|$|E
5|$|Rebounding {{from their}} 2008 campaign, the 2009 Sounds {{achieved}} a 75–69 record under new manager Don Money.

The 2010 season proved to be reminiscent of the previous campaign. Though Nashville finished the year with <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> 77–67 record under Money, it was only good enough to place fourth (last) in the division.|$|E
