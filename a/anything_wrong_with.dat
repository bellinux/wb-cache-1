500|$|From the 1930s, Jinnah {{suffered}} from tuberculosis; only {{his sister and}} a few others close to him were aware of his condition. Jinnah believed public knowledge of his lung ailments would hurt him politically. In a 1938 letter, he wrote to a supporter that [...] "you must have read in the papers how during my tours... I suffered, which was not because there was <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> me, but the irregularities [...] and over-strain told upon my health". Many years later, Mountbatten stated that if he had known Jinnah was so physically ill, he would have stalled, hoping Jinnah's death would avert partition.

And, of course, he totally neglected his health..." [...] Jinnah worked with a tin of Craven [...] "A" [...] cigarettes at his desk, of which he had smoked 50 or more a day for the previous 30 years, as well as a box of Cuban cigars. [...] As his health got worse, he took longer and longer rest breaks in the private wing of Government House in Karachi, where only he, Fatima and the servants were allowed.|$|E
500|$|Waugh was {{approached}} at the Oberoi by an Indian man, {{who was also}} staying at the hotel. The man called himself [...] "John" [...] and gave no surname. John {{said he was a}} man who had won money betting on cricket and asked Waugh to provide pitch and weather information; he also asked the Australian to reveal inside knowledge about the team, such as tactics and player selections, in exchange for US$4,000. Waugh accepted the money and agreed to provide information about the pitch and weather, but he refused to divulge the tactics that the Australians intended to use against their opposition, or information on which players would play and what their role would be. Information on pitch conditions provides an insight into the strategies that the team might adopt and which players might be used, and teams will field different players depending on the pitch, as their skills are suited to different conditions. The arrangement with John remained in place until the end of the 1994–95 Australian summer. Waugh later said that at the time, he did not see <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> his actions, reasoning that the agreement was similar to a player speculating about their form and the playing conditions in a pre-match media interview.|$|E

500|$|In Britain, the {{reception}} was highly favourable. In their joint review for Record Mirror, Richard Green and Peter Jones found the album [...] "full of musical ingenuity" [...] yet [...] "controversial", and added: [...] "There are parts that will split the pop fraternity neatly down the middle." [...] Allen Evans of the NME highlighted the album's [...] "electronic effects", McCartney's [...] "penchant for the classics" [...] and Harrison's [...] "stunning {{use of the}} sitar" [...] as diverse elements that distinguished it as a group effort, such that the four band members' [...] "individual personalities are now showing through loud and clear". Evans concluded: [...] "this is a brilliant album which underlines {{once and for all}} that the Beatles have definitely broken the bounds of what we used to call pop." [...] Having found Rubber Soul [...] "almost monotonous" [...] at times, Melody Maker lauded the new release as a work that would [...] "change the direction of pop music". Peter Clayton, a jazz critic for Gramophone magazine, described it as [...] "an astonishing collection" [...] that defied easy categorisation since much of the album had no precedent in the context of pop music. Clayton concluded: [...] "if there's <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the record at all it is that such a diet of newness might give the ordinary pop-picker indigestion." ...|$|E
500|$|While under Phleps' command, the {{division}} committed many crimes against {{the civilian population}} of the NDH, especially during Case White and Case Black. These included [...] "burning villages, massacre of inhabitants, torture and murder of captured partisans", and {{the division}} thereby developed a distinctive reputation for cruelty. These charges have been denied by Kumm, among others. But the divisional orders routinely called for the annihilation of hostile civilian population and documents by the Waffen-SS themselves show that these orders were put into practice. For example, Himmler's police representative in the NDH, SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Polizei Konstantin Kammerhofer, reported on 15 July 1943 that units of the 7th SS Division had shot the Muslim population of Kosutica, about 40 men, women, and children gathered in a [...] "church". The division claimed that [...] "bandits" [...] in the village had opened fire, but the police could not discover any traces of combat. Such incidents, which jeopardized the plan to raise a Muslim SS division, led to a dispute between Kammerhofer and Phleps' successor Oberkamp. Himmler ordered Phleps to intervene and Phleps reported on 7 September 1943 {{that he could not}} discover <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the shootings in Kosutica and that Kammerhofer and Oberkamp had resolved their dispute. The war crimes committed by the 7th SS Division became the subject of international controversy when Waldheim's service in the Balkans became public in the mid-1980s, during his successful bid for the Austrian presidency.|$|E
500|$|Francis {{expresses a}} resentment {{of all forms}} of authority, {{particularly}} during the end of the frame story, when he feels he has been institutionalized because of the madness of the authorities, not because there is <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> him. Francis can be seen, at least within the main narrative, as a symbol of reason and enlightenment triumphing over the irrational tyrant and unmasking the absurdity of social authority. But Kracauer contended the frame story undermines that premise. He argues if not for the frame story, the tale of Francis's efforts against Dr. Caligari would have been a praiseworthy example of independence and rebellion against authority. However, with the addition of the frame story, which places the veracity of Francis's claims into question, Kracauer argues the film glorifies authority and turns a reactionary story into an authoritarian film: [...] "The result of these modifications was to falsify the action and to ultimately reduce it to the ravings of a madman." [...] Kracauer believed these changes were not necessarily intentional, but rather an [...] "instinctive submission to the necessities of the screen" [...] because commercial films had to [...] "answer to mass desires". Fritz Lang disagreed with Kracaucer's argument, and instead believes the frame story makes the film's revolutionary inclinations more convincing, not less. David Robinson said, as time passed, filmgoers have been less inclined to interpret the film as a vindication of authority because modern audiences have grown more skeptical of authority in general, and are more inclined to believe Francis's story and interpret the asylum director as wrongly committing Francis to silence him.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} disorders of consciousness goes by the name anosognosia, a Greek-derived term meaning unawareness of disease. [...] This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way, most commonly {{as a result of a}} stroke, but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that there is <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> them. [...] The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain, giving rise to a syndrome known as hemispatial neglect, characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move. [...] When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies: [...] one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him. [...] An even more striking type of anosognosia is Anton–Babinski syndrome, a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.|$|E

[...] in his review of the song on its release as a single, despite his earlier review of Rings Around the World claiming that the album would benefit from the removal of the [...] "Status Quo-ish title track". Q described the track as [...] "excellent" [...] while PopMatters claimed the song [...] "sounds so much like ELO that it blows away everything on last year's ELO reunion album" [...] and the Dallas Observer stated that [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] is a [...] "Beach Boys/Beatles/ELO homage as fine as the '70s heyday of Roy Wood's Wizzard or very early Cheap Trick".Pitchfork Media stated that the song [...] "takes the upbeat Britpop of their debut album and layers on spectral details" [...] while Uncut described the track as [...] "tooled up rock 'n' roll modelled on [...] "Surfin' USA". The Guardian claimed the song's lyrics tackle environmental issues with a [...] "sharp wit" [...] while Drowned in Sound saw them as evidence that chief songwriter Gruff Rhys was [...] "taking his lyrics a little bit more seriously". The song was placed at number 21 in the 2001 Festive Fifty on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show.
