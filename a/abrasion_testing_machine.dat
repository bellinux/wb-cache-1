40|$|Four {{biomimetic}} non-smoothed surface specimens {{with different}} shapes were prepared by laser processing. Tests {{were conducted on}} MMU- 5 G wear and <b>abrasion</b> <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> to study the influencing rule of non-smoothed surfaces on counter pairs. The {{results show that the}} mass loss of the friction pair matching with the non-smoothed units is much greater than the ones matching with the smooth specimens. The pairs matching with different non-smoothed units suffer differently. The non-smoothed surface protruding zone exerts micro cutting on counter pairs. The striation causes the greatest mass loss of the pairs than the other non-smoothed units, which almost doubles the damage of the grid ones suffering the least. The difference in pairs damage is attributed to the different mechanism of undertaking the load in the process of wear. The damage can be alleviated effectively by changing the shapes of the units without increasing or decreasing the area ratio of the non-smoothed units...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As {{a kind of}} {{complicated}} mechanical automation, most of key parts of breech mechanism are cams delivering forces and movements by parts ’ outline and figure. The major fault mode of breech mechanism is grain abrasion caused by dry sliding friction. There are no feasible and practical technologies to simulate and predict the abrasion failure lives of key parts for breech mechanism. A new simulation and prediction method is firstly put forward in this paper. Based on Pro/E and ADAMS, the virtual prototype of breech mechanism of semiautomatic vertical sliding-wedge type is established. Key parts ’ load spectrum can be obtained based on virtual prototype.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the surface {{roughness}} of two aesthetic composite restorative materials after tooth brush abrasion by profilometric methods. Materials and methods: Class I cavity preparations for a posterior composite resin were made on the occlusal surfaces of extracted molars and the samples were restored with Nano ceram X mono (Dentsply) and Giomer (Shofu), light cured and polished (Shofu kit). The samples were then subjected to a custom made <b>abrasion</b> <b>testing</b> <b>machine,</b> simulating tooth brush abrasion at 20, 000 cycles in two consecutive runs, with 10, 000 cycles each in a tooth paste slurry using a weight load of 250 g. The surface texture and roughness of the worn samples after each cycle were examined by SEM and Profilometer. Results: The scanning electron microscopy analysis showed selectively more abraded matrix particles in Giomer compared to the nanocomposites. ANOVA proved highly significant differences between the two groups. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study it can be concluded that toothbrushing abrasion of the nanocomposite resin results in significantly different surface roughness and surface morphology...|$|E
40|$|The wear {{behaviour}} of {{a series}} of chromium containing white irons has been investigated under conditions of high stress grinding abrasion using a specimen on track <b>abrasion</b> <b>testing</b> <b>machine.</b> The measured abrasion resistance of the irons has been explained in terms of microstructure and hardness and with respect to the wear damage observed at and beneath abraded surfaces. During abrasion material removal occurred by cracking and detachment from the matrix of eutectic carbides as well as by penetration and micromachining effects of the abrasive grits being crushed at the wearing surface. Under the particular test conditions used martensitic matrix structures gave higher resistance to abrasion than austenitic or pearlitic. However, no simple relationship was found between general hardness or matrix microhardness at wear surfaces and abrasion resistance, and the test yielded pessimistic results for austenitic irons. The fine structures of the 15 % Cr and 30 % Cr alloys were studied by thin foil transmission electron microscopy. It was found that both the matrix and carbide constituents could be thinned for examination at 100 Kv using conventional dishing followed by ion beam thinning. Flany of the rodlike eutectic N 7 C 3 carbides were seen to consist of clusters of scalier rods with individual 117 C 3 crystals quite often containing central cores of matrix constituent. 3 oth eutectic and secondary N 7 C 3 carbides were found to contain stacking faults on planes normal to the basal plane. In the eutectic carbides in the 30 A Cr iron there was evidence of an in-situ PI 7 C 3 C. transition which had taken place during the hardening heat treatment of this alloy. In the as-cast austenitic matrix iron strain induced martensite was produced at the wear surface contributing to work hardening. The significance of these findings have been discussed in relation to wear performance...|$|E

40|$|Motorcycle crashes {{represent}} a significant health burden to the community, accounting for 22 % of serious casualties on Australian roads each year. In addition, {{it is well}} known and accepted that motorcyclists are significantly overrepresented in crashes given that motorcycle usage accounts for only one percent of vehicle kilometres travelled (ATC, 2011; BITRE, 2009). Soft tissue injuries are the most common injuries experienced by crashed motorcyclists (NSAI, 1998, 2003, 2010). Protective clothing has been developed to help prevent these injuries, yet the performance of protective clothing in Australia is still variable (de Rome et al., 2011). In Australia, while there are no design standards for motorcycle protective clothing, there are non-mandatory Australian Guidelines for manufacturing. However, the guidelines specify the use of an <b>abrasion</b> <b>testing</b> <b>machine</b> which is not designed for the purpose of testing motorcycle protective clothing. Therefore, at present in Australia, there are no mechanisms in place to help maintain a high quality of performance. There is a European Standard for motorcycle protective clothing and this Standard specifies the general requirements for clothing intended to protect the rider against mechanical injury. This Standard (EN 13595) was developed from work undertaken by Woods who examined crash damage to 100 motorcycle suits (99 leather and 1 Kevlar) and observed where damage most frequently occurred as well as the type of damage. Based on the damage distribution, a clothing template was developed that specified four zones, each with different levels of protection dependent upon the clothing’s ability to resist the main types of damage: burst, cut, abrasion and tear. (Woods, 1996 a, 1996 b). It is still unknown how well the performance of materials in the laboratory tests of EN 13595 relates to the performance of clothing in real world motorcycle crashes. With a larger variety of fabrics currently available to motorcycle riders, the performance of clothing in the real world may have varied since Woods developed the Cambridge Abrasion machine in 1996. There is a need to validate the observations on which the EU Standard requirements are based, particularly using a greater range of materials and more modern materials. Additionally, there has been no study since the work of Woods (Woods, 1996 b) that examines the adequacy of the test methods. The objective {{of this study was to}} address this gap and, as abrasion resistance is considered to be the highest priority compared to other damage types (Meredith, Brown, Ivers, & de Rome, 2013), this study set out to determine whether the approach taken to assess abrasion resistance in the EU Standard is appropriate. Specifically, the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the abrasion resistance performance of the clothing worn by the motorcycle riders when tested as required in EN 13595 and the probability of real world injury outcome.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper was to present the results of a special <b>abrasion</b> <b>test</b> of poly(vinyl chloride) and {{polypropylene}} filled with calcium carbonate pipes. <b>Abrasion</b> <b>test’s</b> results for pipes were compared with results of standard <b>abrasion</b> <b>test</b> (Taber method) and hardness test. Design/methodology/approach: Short cuts of pipe were subjected to erosion caused by erodent, usually a mixture of special kind of sand and water. The changes of pipe’s wall thickness was a measure of resistance to erosion. Additionally abrasion resistance was measured using Taber method and ball-hardness was measured using Brinell apparatus. Findings: Calcium carbonate filled polypropylene exhibited lower resistance to abrasion than hard poly(vinyl chloride). Probably it is the result of filler presence in polypropylene. No correlation between hardness and abrasion resistance was found. Research limitations/implications: Applied method may be used to compare different pipe’s materials but its results may not be applied to other plastics products and to other abrasion conditions. Practical implications: <b>Abrasion</b> <b>test</b> used in the research may be applied to compare different materials and different pipelines components. Achieved results showed that calcium carbonate without surface preparation decrease abrasion resistance of polypropylene. Originality/value: Applied method is rarely used for polymer materials testing. Results of presented research may be interesting for pipe manufactures and polymer pipe’s formulations producers...|$|R

40|$|Ice {{abrasion}} {{has been}} reviewed. Concrete and ice and {{their most important}} properties in accordance to ice abrasion have been studied. Concrete strength and contact pressure between ice and concrete {{is found to be}} important factors. Former studies of ice abrasion differ in their conclusions of which parameters they include in their ice abrasion models. The different parameters are; ice contact pressure, ice sliding speed, temperature, concrete strength, size of aggregate, total sliding distance. Different models include {{one or more of these}} parameters. Some of the previous experiments has come to different conclusions, possible reasons for these differences has been discussed. A detailed description of the NTNU Ice Abrasion Laboratory is given. The <b>abrasion</b> <b>test</b> apparatus is based on the sliding contact <b>abrasion</b> <b>test</b> principle. A concrete specimen is mounted and an ice cylinder is slid on top of the concrete with applied pressure. Pressure, speed and temperature are all fully controllable to create different test scenarios. A custom made National Instruments LabView program is used to control, monitor and log the activities in the abrasion laboratory. Ice <b>abrasion</b> <b>testing</b> has been done at the NTNU Ice Abrasion Laboratory, investigating a possible difference in abrasion rate for identical concrete with unlike initial treatment. A total of four concretes sample were tested. All four of them were saturated after this saturation period 2 of them was <b>abrasion</b> <b>tested</b> directly and 2 of them were dried, resaturated and then <b>abrasion</b> <b>tested.</b> <b>Abrasion</b> results were distorted by cracking of the concrete samples. No conclusive data on the abrasion rate were obtained. Two possible reasons for cracking of the concrete samples were found. The concrete samples have not been stored in best possible way before testing, which may have caused them to weaken. Secondly the ice abrasion machine has a weakness somewhere under the concrete sample. Either the concrete bedding its bearings or the load sensors yields during testing allowing the concrete to tilt up and down as the ice moves back and forth. Tilting of the concrete sample creates a bigger strain for the concrete at the turning point of ice cylinder. Measurers to remove this problem are discussed. </p...|$|R

Microencapsulation technology is used into textiles to confer new properties and added value. There {{are a lot of}} different active core microcapsules used in the textile industry such as durable fragrances, skin softeners, insect repellents, dyes, vitamins, antimicrobials, phase change materials, etc. The effect of microcapsules is usually measured by the presence of a property such as odour measurements when flavors are encapsulated. Neverthless, some properties such as hydration, antibacterial, insect repellents, etc., can´t be tested without analytical methods. Microcapsulated products can be applied on fabrics by impregnation, bath exhaustion, foam, spraying and coating. The most extended industrial application is by padding.

40|$|ABSTRACT：A {{new piece}} of test equipment, the slurry wear tester (SWT), was {{proposed}} in this study to evaluate the wear behavior of rubber vulcanizate in environmental contact with slurry. Natural rubber (NR) and chloroprene rubber (CR) were chosen as the basic matrices to test the slurry wear. The fluids used to fill the chamber of the SWT were 35 % HCl and NaCl solution. The Akron <b>abrasion</b> <b>test</b> was used for comparison with SWT. According {{to the results of}} the Akron <b>abrasion</b> <b>test,</b> CR vulcanizate abraded more rapidly than NR vulcanizate under same test condition. It was found that the hysteresis of rubber was key factor contribute to the wear behavior. However, the slurry wear rate of the NR and CR vulcanizates did not change significantly, even with changes in the concentration of acid and the immersion time in both HCl and NaCl solutions; the fluid decreased the friction between the abrasive paper and the specimen. It also reduced the heat generated from repeated deformation and wear debris at the surface of the SWT's abrasion arm. Thus, these phenomena affected the wear behavior of rubber vulcanizate and caused different results in the conventional Akron <b>abrasion</b> <b>test.</b> This outcome could have resulted in an incorrect analysis if the slurry wear behavior of the rubber vulcanizat...|$|R

Thus to {{investigate}} one of the etiological factors as tooth brushing procedure is clinical relevant in order to select the best material combination that may prevent damage of resin dental restoration′s abrasion. Aims: This study evaluated the influence of tooth brushing on mass loss and surface roughness of direct Venus (Vs) and indirect Signum (Sg) resin composites, with and without a surface sealant, Fortify (F). Materials and Methods: Twenty-four specimens were prepared with each resin composite, using their proprietary curing units, according to manufacturer′s instructions. All the specimens were polished and ultrasonically cleaned in distilled water for 5 minutes. Half of the specimens of each resin (n = 12) were covered with F (Vs F and Sg F), except for the control (C) specimens (Vs C and Sg C), which were not sealed. Mass loss (ML) as well as surface roughness (Ra) was measured for all the specimens. Then, the specimens were subjected to toothbrush-dentifrice <b>abrasion,</b> using a <b>testing</b> <b>machine</b> for 67. 000 brushing strokes, in an abrasive slurry. After brushing simulation, the specimens were removed from the holder, rinsed thoroughly and blot dried with soft absorbent paper. The abrasion of the material was quantitatively determined with final measurements of ML and surface roughness, using the method described above. Results: ML data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the analysis indicated that resin composites were not statistically different; however, the specimens sealed with F showed higher ML. Ra mean values of the groups Vs F and Sg F significantly increased. Conclusion: Tooth brushing affects mainly the roughness of the direct and indirect resin composites veneered with a sealant...|$|R
