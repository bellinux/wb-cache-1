Attracted by the undeveloped resources of the country, he removed to West Tennessee, then an almost unbroken wilderness, and settled near Memphis, Tennessee, which {{was at that time}} little more than an Indian trading post. It is an evidence of the success with which he devoted himself to his favorite pursuit, that he obtained the premium for the best bale of short staple cotton exhibited at the World's Fair, The Great Exhibition, in London, in 1851. He took a prominent part in the organization of an Agricultural Society, of which he was for many years the President, and his contributions to the <b>agricultural</b> <b>literature</b> of the day were extensive and valuable. His services in this department, and {{in the development of the}} great Mississippi River valley, were recognized at the [...] "Internal Improvement Convention," [...] which met at Memphis, in 1835, and of which John C.

50|$|Seven {{texts from}} Late Antiquity {{constitute}} the {{main sources of}} the Hippiatrica: the veterinary manuals of Apsyrtus, Eumelus (a veterinary practitioner in Thebes, Greece), Hierocles, Hippocrates, and Theomnestus, {{as well as the}} work of Pelagonius (originally a Latin text translated into Greek), and the chapter on horses from the agricultural compilation of Anatolius. Although the aforementioned authors allude to their classical Greek veterinary predecessors (i.e. Xenophon and Simon of Athens), the roots of their tradition mainly lie in Hellenistic <b>agricultural</b> <b>literature</b> derived from Mago of Carthage. In the 10th century AD, two more sources from Late Antiquity were added to the Hippiatrica: a work by Tiberius and an anonymous set of Prognoses and Remedies (Greek: Προγνώσεις καὶ ἰάσεις). Content-wise, the sources in the Hippiatrica provide no systematic exposition of veterinary art and emphasize practical treatment rather than on aetiology or medical theory. However, the compilation contains a wide variety of literary forms and styles: proverbs, poetry, incantations, letters, instructions, prooimia, medical definitions, recipes, and reminiscences. In the entire Hippiatrica, the name of Cheiron, the Greek centaur associated with healing and linked with veterinary medicine, appears twice (as a deity) {{in the form of a}} rhetorical invocation and in the form of a spell; a remedy called a cheironeion (Greek: χειρώνειον) is named after the mythological figure.|$|E
5000|$|Up {{until the}} time of the Board's {{founding}} (and those in other states) agricultural science had been in a state of relative neglect in this country, with the small amount of literature printed mainly being reprints from European journals, and the journals of other sciences, industry and the arts dwarfing the <b>agricultural</b> <b>literature</b> that did exist. Over the next two decades Flint would help to rectify this through the publishing of numerous annual reports and outside literature. Some examples of this include the first of his reports which contained an extensive history of agriculture in the Commonwealth, the fourth of which contained a treatise on [...] "Grasses and Foraging Plants", a revised edition of Harris's Injurious Insects, and a 450 book on [...] "Milch Cows and Dairy Farming", all of which would go on to be printed for several more editions. His work was well received: Paul A. Chadbourne, a board member and future president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College himself, once stated Flint's treatise on grasses [...] "embodies the most practical and scientific information on the history, culture and nutritive value of the grasses and the grains. His style of writing is plain, simple, forcible and judiciously adapted to the ends he has in view. The large number of illustrations of the different species of grasses are drawn with great care and accuracy, and greatly facilitate the study and identification of unknown specimens." ...|$|E
