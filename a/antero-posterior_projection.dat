40|$|Introduction. The use of {{bone graft}} is still {{debatable}} for treating comminuted fracture. Autograft is the gold standardof bone graft. However, {{it has a}} limitation in supply. Therefore, the use of other source of graft (allograft, xenograft,or synthetic) is increasing. Graft must have good biocompatibility {{in order to enhance}} fracture healing. Materials and methods. Randomized post test only control group was conducted in 30 Sprague-Dawley rats inorder to evaluate biocompatibility of the scaffold. We used hidroxyapatite (HA) -Bongros®, nanocrystalline (HA) -CaSO 4 (Perossal®), nanocrystalline HA (Ostim®), morselized bovine xenograft (BATAN), dan local HA from dr. Sutomo Hospital as the scaffold. Tissue reaction (foreign body giant cell (FBGC) and lymphocyte), radiological andhistological score was evaluated at 8 th weeks. Results. The amount of FBGC and histological score showed significant difference (p= 0, 003 and p= 0, 013). LocalHA scaffold showed the most FBGC accumulation. There {{was no significant difference in}} the amount of lymphocyte(p= 0, 397) and radiological score (p= 0, 204 for <b>antero-posterior</b> <b>projection</b> and p= 0, 506 for medio-lateral projection). There was significant correlation between the amount of foreign body giant cell and histological score (p= 0, 034). Conclusions. Both physical and chemical factor influenced biocompatibility of scaffold. Scaffolds that have poresshowed better histological score compared to that has none. Chemical compound of the scaffold play important rolein tissue reaction. The amount of FBGC showed the cytotoxic level of the scaffold...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Human {{dosimetry}} studies play {{a central}} role in radioligand development for positron emission tomography (PET). Drawing regions of interest (ROIs) on the PET images is used to measure the dose in each organ. In the study aspects related to ROI delineation methods were evaluated for two radioligands of different biodistribution (intestinal vs urinary). Procedures PET images were simulated from a human voxel-based phantom. Several ROI delineation methods were tested: <b>antero-posterior</b> <b>projections</b> (AP), 3 D sub-samples of the organs (S), and a 3 D volume covering the whole-organ (W). Inter- and intra-operator variability ROI drawing was evaluated by using human data. Results The effective dose estimates using S and W methods were comparable to the true values. AP methods overestimated (49 %) the dose for the radioligand with intestinal biodistribution. Moreover, the AP method showed the highest inter-operator variability: 11 ± 1 %. Conclusions The sub-sampled organ method showed the best balance between quantitative accuracy and inter- and intra-operator variability. Postprint (author's final draft...|$|R

40|$|Background: Rib {{fracture}} is {{the most}} common thoracic injury. It is thought to be present in 10 % of all traumatic injuries and in almost 40 % of patients who sustained severe non-penetrating trauma. There are 12 pairs of ribs. This study reviews various methods of acquisition and reconstruction of radiographic images of traumatic rib fractures {{in order to determine the}} optimal views and to simplify rib fracture diagnostics. Material/Methods: Eight different plain radiography pictures of ribs were performed with the patient in an erect position. The following projections were obtained in sequence: oblique at 45 ° or 30 ° angle on inspiration, oblique at 45 ° or 30 ° angle on expiration as well as 45 ° and 39 ° projections during slow and fast breathing. All radiographic examinations were performed using a Philips three-phase scanner installed at the Al- Razi Hospital in Jenin, Palestine. Results: The results demonstrate that the 45 ° <b>antero-posterior</b> oblique <b>projection</b> performed on expiration is recommended for diagnostics and interpretation of traumatic rib fractures. Conclusions: Conclusion emerging from this study are such that for a 45 ° oblique view on expiration is recommended for radiographic imaging of patients with clinical signs of fracture, e. g. evaluation of lower rib fractures, while 45 ° oblique view during fast breathing is recommended for suspected upper rib fractures.

40|$|Background: Cut-out {{failure is}} one of the most common {{complications}} in the Gamma 3 nail fixation system. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine pre-operative or intra-operative risk factors for cut-out failure of lag screws in unstable, intertrochanteric fractures fixed with short Gamma 3 nails. Methods: One hundred and seventy-six patients over 60 years of age, with unstable intertrochanteric fractures (AO/OTA 31 -A 2, 31 -A 3) treated with short Gamma 3 nails were included in this study. All patients completed a minimum of 1 -year follow-up. Analysis of post-operative radiographs included assessment for cut-out failure of lag screw, appropriateness of the entry point, posterior lag screw axis, fracture gaps, posterior displacement of the proximal fragment, and tip-apex distance. Results: Of the 176 patients in this study, 22 patients were identified with cut-out failure. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that improper entry point in an <b>antero-posterior</b> <b>projection</b> (odds ratio 10. 39, 95 % confidence interval 1. 74 – 78. 4), posterior displacement distance of the proximal fragment in a lateral projection (odds ratio 1. 35, 95 % confidence interval 1. 17 – 1. 59), and female sex (odds ratio 17. 14, 95 % confidence interval 1. 88 – 876. 11) were correlated with cut-out failure. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the importance of an optimal position of reduction in the lateral projection in reducing the risk of cut-out failure. In addition, sex difference in bone mineral density, proximal femur geometry, and the bone strength in elderly females may explain why female sex is a risk factor...|$|E
40|$|Current {{standards}} in implant dentistry aim to provide natural prosthetic restorations with the finest esthetic and functional outcomes. Several parameters {{have been suggested}} {{in order to achieve}} gold-standard results: adequate bone height, width, <b>antero-posterior</b> <b>projection,</b> adequate soft tissue quantity and quality, preservation of buccal sulcus, adequate papillae, and gingival contour. Thus the preservation and reconstruction of the alveolar bone and surrounding soft tissues for the placement of dental implants {{has become one of the}} bases of the contemporary practice of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Since its introduction in 1996, alveolar distraction osteogenesis has been considered a viable technique for reconstruction of alveolar bone prior to implant placement Alveolar distraction is a technique in constant evolution. A review of literature within the past 14 years reveal that clear indications for its use exist with outcomes similar and sometimes even more predictable than traditional bone grafting techniques in preparation for implant placement. Although, complications also exist with alveolar distraction, it seems that the majority of them are minor and easy to manage. Appropriate patient selection and a better understanding of the technique are paramount in successful bone regeneration with alveolar distraction osteogenesis. In this way we present three studies with three majors objectives 1 º-To determine the implant stability in osseodistraction-generated bone after a 2 -month consolidation period, assessed by resonance frequency analysis Conclusion: under the limitations of this study, osseodistraction offers –after a 2 month consolidation period- a high primary and secondary stabilities after implant placement. 2 º To determine the feasibility of the transport distraction osteogenesis on the reconstruction of the maxillary defects of oncologic patients Conclusion: Transport distraction osteogeneis can be considered a recommendable reconstructive option after oral cancer treatment –including radiotherapy- particularly for high-surgical-risk, collaborative patients. In the early ages of the technique, many case series reported high percentages of complications, mostly minor in nature. Many of these complications could have been minimized by a comprehensive treatment planning. 3 º To determine if three-dimensional image studies and stererolithografic models ease surgical planning and improve the final results of the treatment. Conclusion: Using of computadorized-aided planning does not avoid the necessity of other techniques of planning and vector control during the distraction treatment...|$|E
40|$|Hip {{fracture}} risk rises 100 - to 1000 -fold {{over six}} decades of age, {{but only a}} minor part of this increase is explained by declining BMD. A potentially independent cause of fragility is cortical thinning predisposing to local crushing, in which bone tissue's material disintegrates at the microscopic level when compressed beyond its capacity to maintain integrity. Elastic instability or buckling of a much thinned cortex might alternatively occur under compression. In a buckle, the cortex moves approximately {{at right angles to}} the direction of load, thereby distorting its microstructure, eventually to the point of disintegration. By resisting buckling movement, trabecular buttressing would protect the femoral neck cortex against this type of failure but not against crushing. We quantified the effect of aging on trabecular BMD in the femoral neck and assessed its contribution to cortical elastic stability, which determines resistance to buckling. Using CT, we measured ex vivo the distribution of bone in the midfemoral necks of 35 female and 33 male proximal femurs from cases of sudden death in those 20 - 95 yr of age. We calculated the critical stress sigma(cr), at which the cortex was predicted to buckle locally, from the geometric properties and density of the cortical zone most highly loaded in a sideways fall. Using long-established engineering principles, we estimated the amount by which stability or buckling resistance was increased by the trabecular bone supporting the most stressed cortical sector in each femoral neck. We repeated these measurements and calculations in an age- and sex-matched series of femoral necks donated by women who had suffered intracapsular hip fracture and controls, using histological measurements of cortical thickness to improve accuracy. With normal aging, trabecular BMD declined asymmetrically, fastest in the supero-lateral one-half (in <b>antero-posterior</b> <b>projection)</b> of the trabecular compartment. When viewed axially with respect to the femoral neck, the most rapid loss of trabecular bone occurred in the posterior part of this region (supero-posterior [S-P]), amounting to a 42 % reduction in women (34 % in men) over five decades of adult age. Because local cortical bone thickness declined comparably, age had no significant effect on the relative contributions of cortical and trabecular bone to elastic stability, and trabecular bone was calculated to contribute 40 % (in men) and 43 % (in women) to the S-P cortex of its overall elastic stability. Hip fracture cases had reduced elastic stability compared with age-matched controls, with a median reduction of 49 % or 37 %, depending on whether thickness was measured histologically or by CT (pQCT; p < 0. 002 for both). This effect was because of reduced cortical thickness and density. Trabecular BMD was similar in hip fracture cases and controls. The capacity of the femur to resist fracture in a sideways fall becomes compromised with normal aging because cortical thickness and trabecular BMD in the most compressed part of the femoral neck both decline substantially. This decline is relatively more rapid than that of femoral neck areal BMD. If elastic instability rather than cortical crushing initiates the fracture event, interventions that increase trabecular bone in the proximal femur have great potential to reduce fracture risk because the gradient defining the increase in elastic stability with increasing trabecular BMD is steep, and most hip fracture cases have sufficient trabecular bone for anabolic therapies to build on...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Physical and {{technical}} differences exist between imaging on an x-ray tabletop and imaging on a trolley. This study evaluates how trolley imaging impacts image quality and radiation dose for an <b>antero-posterior</b> (AP) pelvis <b>projection</b> whilst subsequently exploring means of optimising this imaging examination. Methods: An anthropomorphic pelvis phantom was imaged on a commercially available trolley under various conditions. Variables explored included two mattresses, two image receptor holder positions, three source to image distances (SIDs) and four mAs values. Image quality was evaluated using relative visual grading analysis with the reference image acquired on the x-ray tabletop. Contrast to noise ratio (CNR) was calculated. Effective dose was established using Monte Carlo simulation. Optimisation scores were derived {{as a figure}} of merit by dividing effective dose with visual image quality scores. Results: Visual image quality reduced significantly (p < 0. 05) whilst effective dose increased significantly (p < 0. 05) for images acquired on the trolley using identical acquisition parameters to the reference image. The trolley image with the highest optimisation score was acquired using 130 cm SID, 20 mAs, the standard mattress and platform not elevated. A difference of 12. 8 mm {{was found between the}} image with the lowest and highest magnification factor (18...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the cat superior colliculus (SC), {{in conjunction with the}} accurate measurement of elicited eye movements and histologically verified electrode positions, has revealed a striking antero-posterior variation in collicular organization. Three zones could be defined in the SC on the basis of eye movement patterns and associated neck muscle EMG activity evoked from the deeper layers. The Anterior zone was coextensive with the central 25 degrees of the visual retinotopically coded map contained in the superficial layers. Saccades evoked from this zone were also retinotopically coded, and the latency of EMG activity depended on the position of the eye in the orbit. A similar observation applies to the entire monkey SC. The Intermediate zone was coextensive with the 25 degrees [...] 70 degrees of visual projections. Saccades evoked from this region were "goal-directed" and were associated with invariant, short latency EMG responses. The Posterior zone was found in the extreme caudo-lateral portion of the SC. Eye movements evoked from this zone were centering saccades associated with constant latency EMG activity. The present results in conjunction with previously demonstrated <b>antero-posterior</b> variations in <b>projections</b> to the SC, suggest that the motor strategies controlling gaze shifts toward visual targets vary depending on the location of the target in the visual field...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Chest {{radiography}} {{remains a}} critical tool for diagnosing intrathoracic tuberculosis (TB) {{in young children}} {{who are unable to}} expectorate. We describe the radiological findings in children under 3 years of age investigated for TB in the district of Manhica, southern Mozambique, an area with a high prevalence of TB and HIV. METHODS: Digital <b>antero-posterior</b> and lateral <b>projections</b> were performed and reviewed by two independent readers, using a standardized template. Readers included a local pediatrician and a pediatric radiologist blinded to all clinical information. International consensus case definitions for intra-thoracic TB in children were applied. RESULTS: A total of 766 children were evaluated of whom 43 (5. 6 %) had TB. The most frequent lesion found in TB cases was air space consolidation (65. 1 %), followed by suggestive hilar lymphadenopathy (17. 1 %) and pleural effusion (7. 0 %). Air space consolidation was significantly more common in TB cases than in non-TB cases (odds ratio 8. 9; 95 % CI: 1. 6 - 50. 5), as were hilar lymphadenopathy (OR 17. 2; 95 % CI: 5. 7 - 52. 1). The only case with miliary infiltrates and 3 with pleural effusions occurred in HIV-infected children. CONCLUSION: Frequent air space consolidation complicates radiological distinction between TB and bacterial pneumonia in young children, underscoring the need for epidemiological contextualization and consideration of all relevant signs and symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Family {{relatives}} {{of children with}} nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) who presumably carry a genetic risk yet do not manifest overt oral clefts, often present with distinct facial morphology of unknown genetic etiology. This study investigates distinct facial morphology among unaffected relatives and examines whether candidate genes previously associated with overt NSCL/P and left-right body patterning are correlated with such facial morphology. Cases were unaffected {{relatives of}} individuals with NSCL/P (n = 188) and controls (n = 194) were individuals without family history of NSCL/P. Cases and controls were genotyped for 20 SNPs across 13 candidate genes for NSCL/P (PAX 7, ABCA 4 -ARHGAP 29, IRF 6, MSX 1, PITX 2, 8 q 24, FOXE 1, TGFB 3 and MAFB) and left-right body patterning (LEFTY 1, LEFTY 2, ISL 1 and SNAI 1). Facial shape and asymmetry phenotypes were obtained via principal component analyses and Procrustes analysis of variance from 32 coordinate landmarks, digitized on 3 D facial images. Case-control comparisons of phenotypes obtained were performed via multivariate regression adjusting for age and gender. Phenotypes that differed significantly (P < 0. 05) between cases and controls were regressed on the SNPs one at a time. Cases had significantly (P < 0. 05) more profile concavity with upper face retrusion, upturned noses with obtuse nasolabial angles, more protrusive chins, increased lower facial heights, thinner and more retrusive lips and more protrusive foreheads. Furthermore, cases showed significantly more directional asymmetry compared to controls. Several of these phenotypes {{were significantly associated with}} genetic variants (P < 0. 05). Facial height and width were associated with SNAI 1. Midface <b>antero-posterior</b> (AP) <b>projection</b> was associated with LEFTY 1. The AP position of the chin was related to SNAI 1, IRF 6, MSX 1 and MAFB. The AP position of the forehead and the width of the mouth were associated with ABCA 4 -ARHGAP 29 and MAFB. Lastly, facial asymmetry was related to LEFTY 1, LEFTY 2 and SNAI 1. This study demonstrates that, genes underlying lip and palate formation and left-right patterning also contribute to facial features characteristic of the NSCL/P spectrum.

40|$|Increasing beam {{energies}} {{are well}} {{established as a}} radiation dose-reducing tool in diagnostic radiology. This has led to useful recommendations by the Commission of European Communities (CEC) for appropriate kVp values to be employed {{for a variety of}} examinations. The current work tests the hypothesis that kVp levels above those recommended by the CEC will result in reduced patient dose while still producing images of acceptable quality. This study explored the effect of a range of kVp levels within and above CEC recommendations for lumbar spine radiology. A phantom investigation facilitated selection of appropriate kVp levels for a patient study (n= 59) : 81 kVp (CEC) and 96 kVp (non-CEC) for the AP projection and 90 kVp (CEC) and 102 kVp (non-CEC) for the lateral projection. Entrance surface and effective dose were calculated and image quality quantified using CEC image criteria and images of a detail contrast test tool. Data analysis demonstrated significant reduction in effective radiation dose for AP (29. 9 %) and lateral (24. 6 %) when a kVp value above the CEC range was employed compared with a kVp recommended by the CEC. Although significant reductions in total image quality of 18. 3 % and 10. 1 % for the <b>antero-posterior</b> and lateral <b>projections,</b> respectively, were noted, all patient images produced with all kVp values were considered acceptable by each member of the evaluative panel with all image criteria receiving a score of 2 (out of 3) or better. The psychophysical tests revealed minor non-significant reductions in visualisation scores. The current study demonstrated that kVp values outside the CEC recommended range offer reductions in dose while producing acceptable images. Practitioners should be guided, rather than constrained, by the CEC recommendations on good radiographic technique. The need for further work exploring the effect of higher energies on visualisation of subtle pathological lesions has been identified...|$|R
40|$|Background and rationale: Optimising {{radiation}} dose and image quality in medical imaging {{is essential in}} minimising radiation risk and ensuring images are fit for purpose. This thesis uses novel methods for image quality assessment and {{radiation dose}}/image quality optimisation. The <b>antero-posterior</b> (AP) pelvis <b>projection</b> {{was used as a}} focus for optimisation. Methods: In {{the first part of this}} thesis a visual grading image quality assessment scale is developed and validated in order to assess radiographic image quality. The scale validation is conducted in two phases; the initial phase uses phantom images and is further tested in phase two with cadaveric images. The scale development and validation is guided by psychometric theory and in particular Bandura’s guidelines. In the second part of this thesis a framework is developed to systematically optimise the radiation dose and image quality for AP pelvis radiographic examinations. The methodology development for this section is guided by the factorial based experimental design. The optimisation includes manual and automatic exposure control modes. The image quality is visually assessed using the previously developed (novel) image quality scale and physically using a signal to noise ratio. The optimisation work is conducted with the aim of achieving two objectives: 1) identifying the optimum practice that would produce images with suitable quality and low radiation dose; 2) conducting a systematic investigation into the main effect of the primary acquisition factors on the response variables (e. g. image quality (IQ) and effective dose (E)). Results: A scale of 24 items was produced. These scale items had good inter-item correlation (≥ 0. 2) and high factor loadings (≥ 0. 32). Cronbach's alpha (reliability) revealed that the scale has acceptable levels of internal reliability for both phantom and cadaver (α= 0. 8 and 0. 9, respectively). The factor analysis suggested that the scale is multidimensional (assessing multiple quality themes). Accordingly, it is likely that this scale will be applicable in both clinical and research practices. The optimum practice was identified, resulting in suitable quality images with a lower dose (i. e. 88 to 94...|$|R
