30|$|The Young’s modulus of CLT with {{different}} widths {{was measured using}} a longitudinal vibration method. Similarly, the elastic modulus of CLT corresponding to different lay-ups was measured using dynamic and static methods. The Young’s modulus by the longitudinal vibration method and the true bending Young’s modulus without shear effect, and the shear modulus by the Timoshenko–Goens–Hearmon (TGH) flexural vibration method [12, 13] were measured as the dynamic method. In a typical process, true bending Young’s and shear moduli by the TGH method were measured under in-plane and out-of-plane directions. During the process, CLT was supported at 0.224 times of its length from both the ends. Flexural vibration was excited at the center using a hammer. The motion of CLT was detected using a microphone or an <b>acceleration</b> <b>pickup</b> at the edge. In general, the first, third, and fifth resonance frequencies were obtained through a fast Fourier transform (FFT) comparator (Ono Sokki Co., Ltd., CF- 4500). However, the true bending Young’s and shear moduli were not measured in 3 - 3 -Ma, 3 - 3 -Mi and 3 - 4 -Mi CLT along the out-of-plane direction because the resonance frequencies could not be detected.|$|E

The Passing Sight Distance (PSD) {{has always been a}} subject of studies and research that underline two series of factors that influence the PSD mainly: the first is the size and performance of vehicles, the second is the driver responses to environmental stimuli. This paper presents a study on the differences in some current procedures and guide‐lines used to estimate minimum PSD requirements for highway design. The research starts from a field study of passing maneuvers on two‐lane highways and from a collection of characteristic data of passenger cars. A data obtained by video recordings was used to study some factors influencing the distance value as the actual speed, <b>acceleration</b> (<b>pickup)</b> of vehicles. From the two classical rule models (flying passing, Italian rules, accelerative passing, U. S.) and some modified to these it has simulated the PSD values with data brought by physical characteristics and performance of the passenger cars sold in Italy. The data were corrected with some behavioral characteristics hypothesized for the drivers. It has been supposed three kinds of drivers: a prudent, a normal and an aggressive driver. These drivers with different behavioral kinds influence the simulation data. At the end is showed an analysis of different PSD models and a first approximate model that could link the PSD to the passing vehicle spee...|$|E

This technique models {{the injection}} of thermal and <b>pickup</b> ions, the <b>acceleration</b> of these ions, and {{the determination of the}} shock structure {{under the influence of the}} accelerated ions. The essential effects of injection are treated in a mostly self-consistent manner, including effects from shock obliquity, cross-field diffusion, and pitch-angle scattering. Using recent determinations of pickup ion densities, we are able to match the absolute flux of hydrogen in the ACRs by assuming that pickup ion scattering mean free paths, at the termination shock, are much less than an AU and that moderately strong cross-field diffusion occurs. Simultaneously, we match the flux ratios He + /H + or O + /H + to within a factor ∼ 3. If the conditions of strong scattering apply, no pre-termination-shock injection phase is required and the injection and <b>acceleration</b> of <b>pickup</b> ions at the termination shock is totally analogous to the injection and acceleration of ions at highly oblique interplanetary shocks recently observed by the Ulysses spacecraft. ...|$|R

During the first out-of-ecliptic excursion of Ulysses (1992 – 1996), the HI-SCALE instrument measured corotating energetic particle intensity enhancements characterized by low values (< 10) of the 0. 5 – 1. 0 MeV nucleon - 1 H/He intensity ratio. During the second out-of-ecliptic excursion of Ulysses (1999 – 2002), the more frequent occurrence of solar energetic particle events resulted in almost continuously high (< 20) values of the H/He ratio, even at the highest heliolatitudes reached by Ulysses. Comparison with in-ecliptic measurements from an identical instrument on the ACE spacecraft showed similar H/He values at ACE and Ulysses, suggesting a remarkable uniformity of energetic particle intensities in the solar maximum heliosphere at high heliolatitudes and in the ecliptic plane. In-ecliptic observations of the H/He intensity ratio from the IMP- 8 spacecraft show variations between solar maximum and solar minimum similar to those observed by Ulysses at high heliographic latitudes.

40|$|A {{new model}} of the cold Io torus is described. Ions and energy are {{injected}} into the system by independent processes so that the mass balance is isolated from the energy balance.

The primary energy loss mechanism of the plasma is collisionally excited line emission at optical wavelengths. The primary ion source is radial diffusion inward from the hot torus on a time scale of 140 - 710 days. The primary ion loss mechanism is a novel two-step enhanced recombination mechanism involving charge exchange between thermal ions and an extended cloud of neutral SO 2 molecules, followed by rapid dissociative recombination of the resultant molecular ion.

A comparison of the regions upstream and downstream of the bow shock is made to assess {{the relative merits of}} each as a site for stochastic acceleration of ions above the pickup energy through interaction with low-frequency MHD waves. In the far upstream region the data are most consistent with a model where pickup ions generate a low level of MHD waves but remain relatively scatter-free. In the downstream region intense magnetic fluctuations gives rise to rapid isotropization of the ions and a second-order stochastic acceleration. The properties of the MHD power spectrum are related to the energetic ion spectrum in the framework of a leaky box model where the bulk of the acceleration occurs downstream of the shock throughout the cometosheath.

40|$|The <b>acceleration</b> of cometary <b>pickup</b> ions by {{magnetohydrodynamic}} waves at P/Giacobini-Zinner is examined {{in a model}} where acceleration predominantly occurs downstream of the bow shock throughout the cometosheath where intense magnetic turbulence exists.

This principal loss mechanism for the ions is spatial diffusion out of the acceleration region moderated by the self-same accelerating waves. This particular feature constrains the model {{in a way that the}} predicted ion spectrum is uniquely determined by the power spectrum of the magnetic turbulence. At both P/Giacobini-Zinner and P/Halley, the turbulence is non-Kolmogoroff with a spectral index of 2 resulting in an ion spectral behavior that is approximately an exponential in ion speed, consistent with a recent analysis of the Giacobini-Zinner data (see Richardson et al.) ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{species of}} pickup ions, both of {{interstellar}} origin and from an inner, distributed source {{have been discovered}} {{using data from the}} Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) on Ulysses. Velocity distribution functions of these ions were measured for the first time over heliocentric distances between 1. 35 and 5. 4  AU, both at high and low latitudes, and in the disturbed slow solar wind as well as the steady fast wind of the polar coronal holes. This has given us the first glance at plasma properties of suprathermal ions in various solar wind flows, and is enabling us to study the chemical and, in the case of He, the isotopic composition of the local interstellar cloud. Among the new findings are (a)  the surprisingly weak pitch-angle scattering of low rigidity, suprathermal ions leading to strongly anisotropic velocity distributions in radial magnetic fields, (b)  the efficient injection and consequent <b>acceleration</b> of <b>pickup</b> ions, especially He+ and H+, in the turbulent solar wind, and (c)  the discovery of a new extended source releasing carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and possibly other atoms and molecules in the inner solar system.

40|$|Hybrid (kinetic ion/fluid electron) {{simulations}} {{have been}} used to study self-consistently the injection and initial stages of <b>acceleration</b> of interstellar <b>pickup</b> ions at the solar wind termination shock. Results are presented from one-dimensional simulations of high Mach number oblique (40 deg- 50 deg) shocks with a 10 % population of interstellar pickup hydrogen. In these simulations, the pickup ions, the solar wind ions, the shock fields and the waves are all treated self-consistently. Pickup ions reflected by the shock excite large amplitude (DELTA. B / B approximately 0. 3) upstream magnetosonic waves. These waves, in turn, scatter the pickup hydrogen, as expected in the diffusive shock acceleration process. The spectrum of excited waves broadens in time. We find that, for the parameters studied, the termination shock efficiently injects and accelerates the interstellar pickup hydrogen, and thus this work represents a microscopic verification of this anomalous cosmic ray injection mechanism. Comparison of injected fluxes from the simulations with Voyager fluxes extrapolated to the termination shock suggests that injection at the termination shock is probably greater than injection by interplanetary shocks. A study of accelerated pickup ion orbits shows that the energy gain comes predominantly from shock drift acceleration in the shock front, with the upstream waves aiding the acceleration by allowing multiple encounters with the shock...|$|R

40|$|Heliospheric {{energetic}} neutral atoms (ENAs) {{that will}} be measured by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) originate from the heliosheath. The heliosheath {{is formed as a}} result of the interaction of the solar wind (SW) with the circum-heliospheric interstellar medium (CHISM). The expected fluxes of ENAs are strongly dependent on the nature of this interaction. In turn, the interaction of the solar wind with the local interstellar cloud has a complex and multi-component nature. Detailed theoretical modeling of the interaction between the SW and the local interstellar medium is required to understand the physics of the heliosheath and to predict and explain the heliospheric ENAs. This paper summarizes current state-of-art kinetic-gasdynamic models of the SW/CHISM interaction. We shall restrict our discussion to the kinetic-gasdynamic and kinetic-magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models developed by the Moscow group. This paper summarizes briefly the main results of the first self-consistent, two-component, kinetic-gasdynamic model by Baranov and Malama (J. Geophys.

40|$|<b>Acceleration</b> of {{interstellar}} <b>pickup</b> H(+) and He(+) {{as well as}} of solar wind protons and alpha particles has been observed on Ulysses during the passage of a corotating interaction region (CIR) at approximately 4. 5 AU. Injection efficiencies for both the high thermal speed interstellar pickup ions (H(+) and He(+)) and the low thermal speed solar wind ions (H(+) and He(++) are derived using velocity distribution functions of protons, pickup He(+) and alpha particles from less than 1 to 60 keV/e and of ions (principally protons) above approximately 60 keV. The observed spatial variations of the few keV and the few hundred keV accelerated pickup protons across the forward shock of CIR indicate a two stage acceleration mechanism. Thermal ions are first accelerated to speeds of 3 to 4 times the solar wind speed inside the CIR, presumably by some statistical mechanism, before reaching higher energies by a shock acceleration process. Our results also indicate that (1) the injection efficiencies for pickup ions are almost 100 times higher than they are for solar wind ions, (2) pickup H(+) and He(+) are the two most abundant suprathermal ion species and they carry a large fraction of the particle thermal pressure, (3) the injection efficiency is highest for protons, lowest for He(+), and intermediate for alpha particles, (4) both H(+) and He(+) have identical spectral shapes above the cutoff speed for pickup ions, and (5) the solar wind frame velocity distribution function of protons has the form F(w) = F(sub o) w(sup - 4) for 1 is less than w is less than approximately 5, where w is the ion speed divided by the solar wind speed. Above w approximately 5 - 10 the proton spectrum becomes steeper.
