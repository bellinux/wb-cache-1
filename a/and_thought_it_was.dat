5|$|During Harrison's administration, the Lakota Sioux, {{previously}} {{confined to}} reservations in South Dakota, grew restive {{under the influence}} of Wovoka, a medicine man, who encouraged them to participate in a spiritual movement called the Ghost Dance. Many in Washington did not understand the predominantly religious nature of the Ghost Dance, <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a militant movement being used to rally Native Americans against the government. On December 29, 1890, troops from the Seventh Cavalry clashed with the Sioux at Wounded Knee. The result was a massacre of at least 146 Sioux, including many women and children; the dead Sioux were buried in a mass grave. In reaction Harrison directed Major General Nelson A. Miles to investigate and ordered 3500 federal troops to South Dakota; the uprising was brought to an end. Wounded Knee is considered the last major American Indian battle in the 19th century. Harrison's general policy on American Indians was to encourage assimilation into white society and, despite the massacre, he believed the policy to have been generally successful. This policy, known as the allotment system and embodied in the Dawes Act, was favored by liberal reformers at the time, but eventually proved detrimental to American Indians as they sold most of their land at low prices to white speculators.|$|E
5|$|India Knight, {{a novelist}} and {{columnist}} for The Sunday Times, tweeted on 9 July 2013 {{that she had}} been reading The Cuckoo's Calling <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> good for a début novel. In response, a tweeter called Jude Callegari said that the author was Rowling. Knight queried this but got no further reply. Knight notified Richard Brooks, arts editor of the Sunday Times, who began his own investigation. After discovering that Rowling and Galbraith had the same agent and editor, he sent the books for linguistic analysis which found similarities, and subsequently contacted Rowling's agent who confirmed it was Rowling's pseudonym. Within days of Rowling being revealed as the author, sales of the book rose by 4,000%, and Little Brown printed another 140,000 copies to meet the increase in demand. , a signed copy of the first edition sold for US$4,453 (£2,950), while an unsold signed first-edition copy was being offered for $6,188 (£3,950).|$|E

25|$|In the Letter, Rousseau {{rejected}} the traditional notion of male politicians {{being responsible for}} moral reform, <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> women's responsibility. He considered women, {{by virtue of their}} nature, to be the primary agents of moral reform, and that the success of the state depends on the harmony within private, domestic life. Rousseau opposed marriage without love (i.e. marriage for financial reasons, order, lust, convenience). In Rousseau's opinion, true love for the nurturing, feminine mother, instead of lustful love for a mistress, {{goes hand in hand with}} patriotism and civic harmony. The legislator's task is to make sure a society's women are in order.|$|E

After briefly exploring the land south of present-day St. Augustine, the expedition sailed south to the bottom of the Florida peninsula, through the Florida Keys, and up the west coast as far north as Charlotte Harbor, where they briefly skirmished with the Calusa before heading back to Puerto Rico.|$|E

25|$|The Mishna and Talmud (Avodah Zara 8a) {{describe}} a pagan festival called Saturna which occurs {{for eight days}} before the winter solstice. It is followed for eight days after the solstice with a festival called Kalenda culminating with the Kalends of January. The Talmud ascribes the origins of this festival to Adam, who saw that the days were getting shorter <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> punishment for his sin. He was afraid {{that the world was}} returning to the chaos and emptiness that existed before creation. He sat and fasted for eight days. Once he saw that the days were getting longer again he realized that this was the natural cycle of the world, so made eight days of celebration. The Talmud states that this festival was later turned into a pagan festival.|$|E

Anthropologist Carlos Garma Navarro criticized that the accusations were first brought before the mass media, <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> very likely that the accusations were an attempt to give the church a bad image.

The number and positioning of the stones according to Wood, corresponded to the Pythagorean planetary system of worlds, with three of the circles corresponding to the solar, lunar and Earth cycles. This deeply influenced his plans for a circle of 30 houses called The Circus in Bath, an ambitious architectural project completed by his son John Wood, the Younger.|$|E

Dominic Cooper took {{on the role of}} John Willoughby, Brandon's rival for Marianne's affections. Describing his character, Cooper said [...] "The way I tried to persuade myself he wasn't too bad was that he's a 25-year-old young guy and he genuinely falls in love with Marianne – he's not just doing it for one moment in time."

Judy Daniel from Sinclair User called the gameplay [...] "dodgy" [...] <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not one of Singleton's best games. A reviewer for Computer Gamer was more negative towards the game. While saying that the game had interesting ideas in it, they did not think that the ideas worked together.

An audience of Los Angeles entertainment journalists, critics, and others greeted the film with guffaws and hoots at a screening in Century City while other viewers in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore responded with derisive laughter or simply walked out. At a post-launch publicity event, Travolta, on asking assembled journalists if they had enjoyed it, received no reply. He later asserted that other filmmakers had enjoyed the movie: [...] "When I felt better about everything was when George Lucas and Quentin Tarantino, {{and a lot of}} people that I felt knew what they were doing, saw it <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a great piece of science fiction."

Though he felt the episode did not quite match up to [...] "Peter", Ramsey Isler from IGN rated [...] "Subject 13" [...] an 8.5/10.

Redding {{was inspired by the}} Beatles album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and tried to create a similar sound, against the label's wishes. His wife Zelma disliked its atypical melody. The Stax crew were also dissatisfied with the new sound; Stewart thought that it was not R, while bassist Donald [...] "Duck" [...] Dunn feared it would damage Stax's reputation. However, Redding wanted to expand his musical style <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> his best song, correctly believing it would top the charts.
