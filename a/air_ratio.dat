Based on ground monitoring air quality data collected in 2015 in Chinese cities above the prefectural level, this study identifies the spatiotemporal variations {{of air pollution}} and its associated driving factors in China using descriptive statistics and geographical detector methods. The {{results show that the}} average <b>air</b> pollution <b>ratio</b> and continuous <b>air</b> pollution <b>ratio</b> across Chinese cities in 2015 were 23. 1 ± 16. 9 % and 16. 2 ± 14. 8 %. The highest levels of <b>air</b> pollution <b>ratio</b> and continuous <b>air</b> pollution <b>ratio</b> were observed in northern China, especially in the Bohai Rim region and Xinjiang province, and the lowest levels were found in southern China. The average and maximum levels of continuous air pollution show distinct spatial variations when compared with those of the continuous <b>air</b> pollution <b>ratio.</b> Monthly changes in both <b>air</b> pollution <b>ratio</b> and continuous <b>air</b> pollution <b>ratio</b> have a U-shaped variation, indicating that the highest levels of air pollution occurred in winter and the lowest levels happened in summer. The results of the geographical detector model further reveal that the effect intensity of natural factors on the spatial disparity of the <b>air</b> pollution <b>ratio</b> is greater than that of human-related factors. Specifically, among natural factors, the annual average temperature, land relief, and relative humidity have the greatest and most significant negative effects on the <b>air</b> pollution <b>ratio,</b> whereas human factors such as population density, the number of vehicles, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) witness the strongest and most significant positive effects on <b>air</b> pollution <b>ratio...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cost {{reduction}} plays {{a significant}} role in the field of concentrated solar thermal energy. It is therefore essential to quantify all factors that influence the energy conversion efficiency. The <b>air</b> return <b>ratio</b> is a key factor for the overall efficiency of the open volumetric receiver. It is the fraction of the blown out air which is sucked in again through the solar receiver. To achieve a high receiver efficiency it is therefore important to increase the <b>air</b> return <b>ratio.</b> Many variables such as wind speed and direction, geometry of the receiver design and operational mode influence the air flow in front of the receiver. This in turn influences the <b>air</b> return <b>ratio.</b> It is therefore of vital importance to be able to measure the <b>air</b> return <b>ratio</b> and furthermore visualize the air flow in front of the receiver. The air return value was prior to this work unknown on a large scale and under concentrated solar irradiation. The development of a measurement technique for the quantification of the <b>air</b> return <b>ratio</b> with maximum accuracy is the main objective of this thesis. The second objective lies in the visualization of the returned air. This improves the understanding of the occurring flow phenomena which govern the <b>air</b> return <b>ratio.</b> The measurement methods were developed at a lab scale, tested under operating conditions and successfully demonstrated at the solar tower Jülich. In order to measure the <b>air</b> return <b>ratio,</b> three variants of a novel circular tracer gas measurement technique have been developed. The tracer gas is injected either continuously or intermittently into the open air system. The tracer gas is diluted by the imperfect <b>air</b> return <b>ratio.</b> The mole fraction of the injected noble gas helium is measured with a mass spectrometer within the air system, from which the <b>air</b> return <b>ratio</b> is determined. A temporal resolution of 0. 5 s has been achieved. A maximal <b>air</b> return <b>ratio</b> of (68. 6 ± 0. 7) % with 95 % confidence interval has been measured during irradiation with concentrated sunlight at the solar tower power plant Jülich. This is higher than thepreviously assumed <b>air</b> return <b>ratio</b> of 60 %. This difference corresponds to a 4 − 5 % higher overall system efficiency. The return air in front of the receiver was visualized for the first time with the newly developed Induced Infrared Thermography. Hereby, carbon dioxide is added to the return air.

However, the low density of the acetylene/air mixture is such that the total combustion energy is quite low and weak containers such as bamboo or even glass rarely shatter.

In reality, most fuels consist {{of a combination of}} heptane, octane, a handful of other alkanes, plus additives including detergents, and possibly oxygenators such as MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) or ethanol/methanol. These compounds all alter the stoichiometric ratio, with most of the additives pushing the ratio downward (oxygenators bring extra oxygen to the combustion event in liquid form that is released at time of combustions; for MTBE-laden fuel, a stoichiometric ratio can be as low as 14.1:1). Vehicles that use an oxygen sensor or other feedback loop to control fuel to <b>air</b> <b>ratio</b> (lambda control), compensate automatically for this change in the fuel's stoichiometric rate by measuring the exhaust gas composition and controlling fuel volume. Vehicles without such controls (such as most motorcycles until recently, and cars predating the mid-1980s) may have difficulties running certain fuel blends (especially winter fuels used in some areas) and may require different jets (or otherwise have the fueling ratios altered) to compensate. Vehicles that use oxygen sensors can monitor the air-fuel ratio with an air-fuel ratio meter.|$|E
