25|$|<b>A</b> <b>Moment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Earth {{proved to}} be very controversial, {{especially}} among environmentalists. Easterbrook was accused of mischaracterizing data concerning environmental health, using faulty logic, and being overly optimistic. Other reviewers, like Michael Specter in The New York Times, had praise for the book's efforts to raise positive points {{in the debate over}} environmental policy.|$|E
500|$|The {{head of the}} {{household}} takes a jug of wine and pours some on the badnjak; in some regions, he may strew wheat grains over the logs. He then proposes a toast: [...] "Grant, O God, that there be health and joy in this home, that our grain and grapevines yield well, that children be born healthy to us, that our property increase in the field, pen, and barn!" [...] or, [...] "Hail, badnjak, veseljak! I give you wheat and wine, and you give me every good thing and peace!" [...] or similar. The name veseljak, literally [...] "jovial one", is used along with badnjak in some areas. The head drinks a draught of wine from the jug, after which it is passed to other members of household. In the clan of Kuči, wine is poured on the [...] "beard" [...] of the badnjak, and then a little girl sits for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> log—for the well-being of the cattle. Christmas Eve dinner follows, which traditionally includes a round loaf of unleavened bread, beans, fish, walnuts, honey, and red wine. The bread is not cut with a knife, but broken with hands.|$|E
2500|$|Norman Borlaug, one of {{the most}} {{important}} figures in the Green Revolution, was the subject of an admiring Easterbrook article in 1997, and again in 2009 marking Borlaug's passing. [...] Both articles said that Borlaug had disproved the earlier dire predictions of Paul R. Ehrlich, author of the 1968 book The Population Bomb. [...] Ehrlich has severely criticized Easterbrook’s 1995 book <b>A</b> <b>Moment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Earth.|$|E

2500|$|Easterbrook {{wrote the}} book <b>A</b> <b>Moment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Earth (1995), subtitled [...] "the coming age of {{environmental}} optimism," [...] which presaged Bjørn Lomborg's book The Skeptical Environmentalist, first published in Danish three years later; Easterbrook argued that many environmental indicators, with the notable exception of greenhouse gas production, are positive. He called the environmental movement [...] "among the most welcome social developments of the twentieth century," [...] but criticized environmentalists who promoted {{what he saw as}} overly pessimistic views that did not accept signs of improvement and progress.|$|E
2500|$|The {{center of}} {{pressure}} [...] is {{the point where the}} total sum of a pressure field acts on a body, causing a force to act through that point. The total force vector acting at the {{center of pressure}} is the value of the integrated vectorial pressure field. [...] The resultant force and center of pressure location produce equivalent force and moment on the body as the original pressure field. Pressure fields occur in both static and dynamic fluid mechanics. [...] Specification of the center of pressure, the reference point from which the center of pressure is referenced, and the associated force vector allows the moment generated about any point to be computed by a translation from the reference point to the desired new point. It is common for the center of pressure to be located on the body, but in fluid flows it is possible for the pressure field to exert <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> body of such magnitude that the center of pressure is located outside the body.|$|E
