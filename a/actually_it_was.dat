25|$|These {{purposes}} of the emperors and Lê Văn Hưu explained why the historian chose {{the foundation of the}} Kingdom of Nam Việt in 207 BC by Triệu Đà as the starting point for the history of Vietnam, an opinion which was challenged by several Vietnamese historians from Ngô Thì Sĩ in eighteenth century to modern historians because the kings of Nam Việt were of Chinese origin. Based on the independence of Nam Việt from the Han dynasty, Lê Văn Hưu considered its founder Triệu Đà the first and fine example of a Vietnamese ruler caring for the independence of the country. Another example for Lê Văn Hưu's interest in the theme of Vietnam's equality with China was his remark on the enthronement in 968 of Đinh Tiên Hoàng who was considered by Lê Văn Hưu the successor of Triệu Đà in reclaiming the identity of Vietnam while <b>actually</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Ngô Quyền who marked the end of the northern domination in Vietnam in 938 with his victory in the Battle of Bạch Đằng. According to the historian, it was Đinh Tiên Hoàng and not Ngô Quyền who had the major contribution in re-establishing the independent status of the country from China because Ngô Quyền was content only with the position of King (Vương) while Đinh Tiền Hoàng took a further step in designating himself as the emperor (Hoàng đế) of the country and was thus equal to the emperor of the Song dynasty.|$|E

2500|$|The First {{battle of}} Komárom {{was one of}} the most {{important}} battles of the Hungarian War of Independence, fought on 26 April 1849, between the Hungarian and the Austrian Imperial main armies, which ended, in some opinions with a Hungarian victory, while others say that <b>actually</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> undecided. This battle was part of the Hungarian Spring Campaign. [...] After the revolutionary army attacked and destroyed the Austrian blockade around the fortress, the Imperials, because of receiving reinforcements which made them numerically much superior than their enemies, successfully counterattacked, but after they secured the situation, they retreated towards Győr, leaving the trenches and much of their siege artillery in Hungarian hands. With this battle the Hungarian revolutionary army relieved the fortress of Komárom from a very long imperial siege, and forced the enemy to retreat in the westernmost land strip of Kingdom of Hungary. After this battle, following a long debate about among the Hungarian military and political leaders, in which direction to continue their advancement: towards Vienna, the Habsburg capital, or Buda the Hungarian capital, which fortress was still held by Austrian forces, the second option was chosen.|$|E

2500|$|George Harrison wrote [...] "Life Itself" [...] and {{the other}} songs for his album Somewhere in England between mid 1979 and {{the early part of}} 1980. Harrison's songwriting at this time contrasted in tone with the light-heartedness of his two {{previous}} albums, Thirty Three & 1/3 (1976) and George Harrison (1979). Both of these works had continued to present a softening in the artist's spiritual vision since 1974, the year in which he had publicly espoused a hard-line Hindu religiosity in his North American concerts with Ravi Shankar and in devotional songs such as [...] "It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)". While promoting his self-titled 1979 album, Harrison said that he was no longer interested in promoting so obvious a religious message as he had in his biggest hit, [...] "My Sweet Lord". Later in 1979, the content of his HandMade Films comedy Monty Python's Life of Brian attracted controversy from Christian religious groups, a point to which Harrison later responded: [...] "All it made fun of was people's stupidity in the story [...] … <b>Actually</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> upholding Him and knocking all the idiotic stuff that goes on around religion …" [...] Songs such as [...] "Life Itself", [...] "Writing's on the Wall" [...] and [...] "Sat Singing" [...] nevertheless reflected his return to more spiritually focused songwriting, recalling the themes of Harrison's albums All Things Must Pass (1970) and Living in the Material World (1973).|$|E

Coulter said she agreed that probable cause existed in the case, but that refusing consent, being in flight school and overstaying a visa should not constitute grounds for a search. Citing a poll which found that 98 percent of Muslims between the ages of 20 and 45 said they would not fight for Britain in the war in Afghanistan, and that 48 percent said they would fight for Osama bin Laden she asserted [...] "any Muslim who has attended a mosque in Europe—certainly in England, where Moussaoui lived—has had 'affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups,'" [...] so that she parsed Rowley's position as meaning that [...] "'probable cause' existed to search Moussaoui's computer because he was a Muslim who had lived in England." [...] Coulter says the poll was [...] "by the [...] "Daily Telegraph", <b>actually</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> by Sunrise, an [...] "Asian" [...] (i.e., Indian subcontinent-oriented) radio station, canvassing the opinions of 500 Muslims in Greater London (not Britain as a whole), mainly of Pakistani origin and aged between 20 and 45.
