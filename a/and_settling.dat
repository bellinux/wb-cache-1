A commander without a command he subsequently took ship back to France and there retired from his commission, later returning to his family <b>and</b> <b>settling</b> on Île de France. The action temporarily left the French with no naval forces in the East Indies at all, although raiding cruises by privateers still posed a considerable threat to the British Indian Ocean trade routes. The only subsequent reinforcement to arrive in the region during the war was the frigate Chiffone was intercepted and captured at the Battle of Mahé shortly after arrival in 1801, although substantial reinforcements did reach Île de France before the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803.|$|E

He eventually rose to be three times mayor of Hulster Ambacht and twice mayor of Hulst. Thanks to powerful allies in the Middelburg chamber of the VOC he was able to successfully appeal for the cancellation of the fines placed on him, and the money was returned. In 1640 he married Anna van Driel, who died that same year while giving birth to Nuyts' third son, also called Pieter. In 1649 he married his third (or perhaps fourth) and final wife, Agnes Granier, who was to outlive him.|$|E

Despite his mother's protectiveness, Parseghian became involved in sports from an early age, and developed a reputation as the toughest kid in his class. He was hired by Akron's Board of Education in the eighth grade to patrol his school's grounds at night to deter vandals.|$|E

5|$|Diptera {{is one of}} {{the major}} insect orders and are of {{considerable}} ecological and human importance. Flies are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives. Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination. Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research, but less benignly, mosquitoes are vectors for malaria, dengue, West Nile fever, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious diseases, and houseflies spread food-borne illnesses. Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers, buzzing <b>and</b> <b>settling</b> on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids. Larger flies such as tsetse flies and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle. Blowfly larvae, known as gentles, and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as fishing bait and as food for carnivorous animals. They are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wounds.|$|E
5|$|In April 1943 Graf Zeppelin {{was again}} towed eastward, first to Gotenhafen, {{then to the}} {{roadstead}} at Swinemünde and finally berthed at a back-water wharf in the Parnitz River, two miles (3km) from Stettin, {{where she had been}} briefly docked in 1941. There she languished {{for the next two years}} with only a 40-man custodial crew in attendance. When Red Army forces neared the city in April 1945, the ship's Kingston valves were opened, flooding her lower spaces <b>and</b> <b>settling</b> her firmly into the mud in shallow water. A ten-man engineering squad then rigged the vessel's interior with demolition and depth charges in order to hole the hull and destroy vital machinery. At 6pm on 25 April 1945, just as the Soviets entered Stettin, commander Wolfgang Kähler radioed the squad to detonate the explosives. Smoke billowing from the carrier's funnel confirmed the charges had gone off, rendering the ship useless to her new owners for many months to come.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to conservative pressure to constrain Röhm, Hitler left for Neudeck {{to meet with}} Hindenburg. Blomberg, who had been meeting with the President, uncharacteristically reproached Hitler for not having moved against Röhm earlier. He then told Hitler that Hindenburg was close to declaring martial law and turning the government over to the Reichswehr if Hitler did not take immediate steps against Röhm and his brownshirts. Hitler had hesitated for months in moving against Röhm, {{in part due to}} Röhm's visibility as the leader of a national militia with millions of members. However, the threat of a declaration of martial law from Hindenburg, the only person in Germany with the authority to potentially depose the Nazi regime, put Hitler under pressure to act. He left Neudeck with the intention of both destroying Röhm <b>and</b> <b>settling</b> scores with old enemies. Both Himmler and Göring welcomed Hitler's decision, since both had much to gain by Röhm's downfall– the independence of the SS for Himmler, and the removal of a rival for the future command of the army for Göring.|$|E

5|$|Morris also {{continued}} writing poetry and began designing illuminated manuscripts and embroidered hangings. In March 1857, Bell and Dandy {{published a book}} of Morris's poems, The Defence of Guenevere, which was largely self-funded by the author. It did not sell well and garnered few reviews, {{most of which were}} unsympathetic. Disconcerted, Morris would not publish again for a further eight years. In October 1857 Morris met Jane Burden, a woman from a poor working-class background, at a theatre performance and asked her to model for him. Smitten with her, he entered into a relationship with her and they were engaged in spring 1858; Burden would later admit however that she never loved Morris. They were married in a low-key ceremony held at St Michael at the North Gate church in Oxford on 26 April 1859, before honeymooning in Bruges, Belgium, <b>and</b> <b>settling</b> temporarily at 41 Great Ormond Street, London.|$|E
5|$|Poniatowski's {{plans were}} ruined by the Kościuszko Uprising. The king did not {{encourage}} it, {{but once it}} began he supported it, seeing no other honorable option. Its defeat {{marked the end of}} the Commonwealth. Poniatowski tried to govern the country in the brief period after the defeat of the Uprising, but on 2 December 1794, Catherine demanded that he leave Warsaw, a request to which he acceded on 7 January 1795, leaving the capital under Russian military escort <b>and</b> <b>settling</b> briefly in Grodno. On 24 October 1795, the act of the final, Third Partition of Poland was signed; one month and one day later, on 25 November, Poniatowski signed his abdication. Catherine died on 17 November 1796, succeeded by Paul I of Russia. On 15 February 1797, Poniatowski left for Saint Petersburg, Russia. He hoped to be allowed to travel abroad, but was not able to secure permission to do so. A virtual prisoner in St. Petersburg's Marble Palace, he subsisted on a pension granted to him by Catherine. Despite financial troubles, he still supported some of his former allies, and he tried to represent the Polish case at the Russian court. He also worked on his memoirs.|$|E
5|$|The {{sport of}} {{baseball}} {{began to be}} played {{in the years following}} the Civil War; a team known as the St. Louis Brown Stockings was founded in 1875. The Brown Stockings were {{a founding member of the}} National League and became a hometown favorite, defeating the Chicago White Stockings (later the Chicago Cubs) in their opener on May 6, 1875. The original Brown Stockings club closed in 1878, and an unrelated National League team with the same name was founded in 1882. This team repeatedly changed its name, shortening to the Browns in 1883, becoming the Perfectos in 1899, <b>and</b> <b>settling</b> on the St. Louis Cardinals in 1900. In 1902, a team moved to St. Louis from Milwaukee and adopted the name St. Louis Browns, although they had no relation to the previous Browns or Brown Stockings. From 1902 until the 1950s, St. Louis was home to two Major League teams.|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} that from Rajaf, a group journeyed southeast <b>and</b> <b>settled</b> at Aru, few kilometers, southeast of Rajaf. That group founded the Olubo ethnic group.

25|$|The {{downward}} movement of large, solid objects by scour <b>and</b> <b>settling</b> processes {{has been documented}} by Jesse E. McNinch, John T. Wells, and other researchers. They concluded that large, heavy objects could sink into the sea bottom by several m without significant lateral movement {{as the result of}} scour <b>and</b> <b>settling</b> processes if an erosion-resistant layer of sediment was not encountered. In case of the beachrock blocks composing the Bimini Road and other pieces underlying it, the erosion-resistant layer that limited how far they were dropped downward by scour <b>and</b> <b>settling</b> processes is the Pleistocene limestone on which they now rest.|$|E
