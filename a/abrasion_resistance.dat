25|$|Various {{methods can}} used to prepare {{cross-linked}} polyethylene (PE-X) from thermoplastic polyethylene (PE-LD, PE-LLD or PE-HD). By crosslinking low-temperature impact strength, <b>abrasion</b> <b>resistance</b> and environmental stress cracking resistance {{can be increased}} significantly, whereas hardness and rigidity are somewhat reduced. PE-X does not melt anymore (analogous to elastomers) and is thermally resistant (over longer periods of up to 120°C, for short periods without mechanical load up to 250°C). With increasing crosslinking density also the maximum shear modulus increases (even at higher temperatures). PE-X has significantly enhanced properties compared with ordinary PE. As PE-X is infusible, always the final pre-products or the mold part are cross-linked.|$|E

2500|$|Neoprene {{is a type}} of {{synthetic}} rubber which can be foamed during manufacture to a high proportion of tiny enclosed gas bubbles, forming a buoyant and thermally-insulating material, called [...] "foamed neoprene", [...] "foam-neoprene" [...] or [...] "expanded neoprene". Wetsuits are made from this material as it is a good insulator, waterproof, and is flexible enough for comfortable wear. The neoprene alone is very flexible, but not very resistant to tearing, so it is skinned with a layer of knit fabric bonded to each side for strength and <b>abrasion</b> <b>resistance.</b> Foamed neoprene may be used for the shell of a drysuit, providing some insulation due to the gas within the material, as in a standard wetsuit. If torn or punctured, leading to flooding, a foam-neoprene suit retains the insulation and buoyancy of the gas bubbles, like a wet suit, which is proportional to the thickness of the foam, Although foamed-neoprene dry suits provide some insulation, thermal under-suits are usually worn in cold water.|$|E

2500|$|Activated carbon can be {{manufactured}} from carbonaceous material, including coal (bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite), peat, wood, or nutshells (e.g., coconut). The manufacturing process {{consists of two}} phases, carbonization and activation. The carbonization process includes drying and then heating to separate by-products, including tars and other hydrocarbons from the raw material, {{as well as to}} drive off any gases generated. The process is completed by heating the material over [...] in an oxygen-free atmosphere that cannot support combustion. The carbonized particles are then [...] "activated" [...] by exposing them to an oxidizing agent, usually steam or carbon dioxide at high temperature. This agent burns off the pore blocking structures created during the carbonization phase and so, they develop a porous, three-dimensional graphite lattice structure. The size of the pores developed during activation {{is a function of the}} time that they spend in this stage. Longer exposure times result in larger pore sizes. The most popular aqueous phase carbons are bituminous based because of their hardness, <b>abrasion</b> <b>resistance,</b> pore size distribution, and low cost, but their effectiveness needs to be tested in each application to determine the optimal product.|$|E

In the present study, complex wastes derived from the automobile industry {{have been used as}} an input stream for the modification of steel surfaces. High <b>abrasion</b> and corrosion <b>resistance</b> steels have attracted much interest in industrial applications because costs associated with product failure can be minimized. Although these classes of steel increase the <b>abrasion</b> and corrosion <b>resistance,</b> they contain expensive alloying elements that increase cost and in addition, complicate production techniques. For this reason, several surface hardening techniques have been developed to improve the <b>abrasion</b> and corrosion <b>resistance</b> of less expensive carbon steel, but these techniques are in general not cost-effective. In this study, a complex industrial waste stream has been transformed in situ via precisely controlled high temperature reactions to produce a chemically-bonded ceramic surface on normal carbon steel. The ceramic surface increases both the compressive strength of the steel, and therefore its <b>abrasion</b> and corrosion <b>resistance.</b> Furthermore, by modifying the composition of the waste input and the processing parameters, the ceramic surface can be effectively customized to match the intended application of the steel.
