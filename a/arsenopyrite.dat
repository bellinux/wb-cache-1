5|$|In 1863, the German chemists Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter were testing ores {{from the}} mines around Freiberg, Saxony. They {{dissolved}} the minerals pyrite, <b>arsenopyrite,</b> galena and sphalerite in hydrochloric acid and distilled raw zinc chloride. Reich, who was color-blind, employed Richter {{as an assistant}} for detecting the colored spectral lines. Knowing that ores from that region sometimes contain thallium, they searched for the green thallium emission spectrum lines. Instead, they found a bright blue line. Because that blue line did not match any known element, they hypothesized a new element was present in the minerals. They named the element indium, from the indigo color seen in its spectrum, after the Latin indicum, meaning 'of India'.|$|E
25|$|Aqueous cyanide is hydrolyzed rapidly, {{especially}} in sunlight. It can mobilize some heavy metals such as mercury if present. Gold {{can also be}} associated with <b>arsenopyrite</b> (FeAsS), {{which is similar to}} iron pyrite (fool's gold), wherein half of the sulfur atoms are replaced by arsenic. Gold-containing <b>arsenopyrite</b> ores are similarly reactive toward inorganic cyanide.|$|E

30|$|The arsenic {{does not}} present {{statistic}} correlation with SO 42 − or other majority ions, {{which indicates that}} the origin of As is not come from pyrite or <b>arsenopyrites</b> minerals sources associate with natural rich formations and mine activities (Table  2) (Smedley and Kinniburgh 2002). The low correlation values (zeros and negative) obtained between As and other ions in Table  2 show {{that it is not}} associated with these elements. This further supports the position that they exist in the form of oxides, which are solubilized in groundwater.|$|R
30|$|The {{land use}} pattern within the basin is primarily, farming (cocoa and food crops) and gold mining. Large acreages of virgin forest were removed and {{replaced}} with cocoa farms. In addition, food crops, such as cassava, yam, cocoyam, plantain, as well as fruits, such as banana; oranges etc, are produced together with cocoa for subsistence. Gold mining within the basin is of two types, “large-scale” and “small-scale” (“Galamsey”). “Large-scale” mining is conducted by heap leach technique or roasting of ore. Oxidised ores derived from sulphide principally <b>arsenopyrites,</b> realgar, orpiment, and pyrites in the weathered zones are heap leached by cyanidation (Kortatsi 2007). Paleoplacer (free milling ore) is mined from deep zones crushed, milled, and cyanided (Kortatsi 2007). “Small-scale” mining involves extracting gold from ochrosols soils mainly from stream floors by mercury amalgamation (Kortatsi 2007).|$|R
30|$|Arsenic {{occurs as}} a major {{component}} in more than 200 minerals, such as elemental arsenic, orpiment, galena, <b>arsenopyrites,</b> marcasite and realgar. Two dominating species of inorganic forms of arsenic which exist in natural water are arsenite (As(III)) and arsenate (As(V)). Arsenite (As(III)) is usually more mobile and toxic than arsenate (As(V)) as the predominant As(III) compound is neutral in charge (Korte and Fernando 1991; Neff 1997). Contamination of {{arsenic in drinking water}} is gradually increasing. It enters into the blood from water, gets concentrated with time and causes cancer of liver, prostate, kidney, skin, lungs and bladder. It is one of the probable risks to instigate hyperkeratosis and change in skin pigmentation (Meng et al. 2000, 2002; Mondal et al. 2006). Long-term exposure of arsenic terminates the function of nervous system and cardiovascular, which may finally lead to death.|$|R
25|$|The {{deposits}} include diverse secondary minerals such as <b>arsenopyrite,</b> anglesite, baryte, bournonite, cerussite, chalcopyrite, freibergite, galena, mimetite, pyrite, pyromorphite, quartz, semseyite, sphalerite, stannite, tetrahedrite and wulfenite.|$|E
25|$|Driggith and Potts Gill Mines worked low {{temperature}} lead-zinc-copper veins {{on the eastern}} and northern slopes of High Pike. <b>Arsenopyrite</b> is abundant there, and its oxidation in veins that also contain primary lead, zinc and copper sulfides has produced a range of supergene arsenates.|$|E
25|$|On {{roasting}} <b>arsenopyrite</b> in air, arsenic sublimes as arsenic(III) oxide leaving iron oxides, while roasting without air {{results in}} the production of metallic arsenic. Further purification from sulfur and other chalcogens is achieved by sublimation in vacuum, in a hydrogen atmosphere, or by distillation from molten lead-arsenic mixture.|$|E
40|$|Surveillance of {{drinking}} water is a necessary action intended to prevent the general public from contaminating water borne diseases. In this study, arsenic concentrations in 22 borehole water samples from various locations in the Wassa West district have been studied using Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis. The samples were irradiated using a 30 kW tank-in-pool Ghana Research Reactor- 1 operating at a thermal neutron flux of 5 × 10 n/s. cm 2. Elevated levels of arsenic were found in virtually all the 22 samples. Arsenic concentration in the samples ranged from 0. 06 ppm to 9. 43 ppm. (Mean- 2. 23,Standard Error of Mean- 0. 57) with minimum concentration of 0. 06 ppm occurring at Ayensukrom No. 1 and the maximum occurring at Tamsu- 9. 43 ppm. These values far exceed the World Health Organization’s recommended value of 0. 01 ppm for arsenic in drinking water. The occurrence of arsenic in the area is traced {{to the existence of}} sulphide minerals such as <b>arsenopyrites</b> (FeAsS 2) present in the underlying Birimian Basement rocks in the area...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe river Ankobra {{flows through}} the {{principal}} gold mining centres in Western Ghana, draining a total area of 8272 km 2 to join the Atlantic ocean. Mercury is used by thousands of small-scale miners {{in the region to}} amalgamate gold. Ores mined in some deep shafts and surface mines are <b>arsenopyrites</b> and the region is marked by the presence of heaps of arsenic - rich mine tailings from both past and recent activities. This study was conducted {{to assess the impact of}} mining activities on the distribution and speciation of arsenic and mercury in the aquatic environment of the Ankobra River. In all, water (filtered and non-filtered) and bed sediments were collected from various locations within the watershed. Principal parameters investigated include total mercury, arsenic (III), arsenic (V), monomethylarsonic acid (MMAA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA). Seasonal and spatial variations of these parameters were investigated. Quality control systems were adopted at both the environmental and analytical stages of the study. In general, areas close to the mining centres are the most polluted. As (V) /As (III) ratios in water are reversed after the first 100 -km of the river length with the onset of industrial influence downstream...|$|R
30|$|Owing to the {{discharge}} of mine effluents into river and stream sources through mining activities, several of the surface water resources which hitherto, served as potable sources for the communities within the Lower Pra Basin, have become polluted and unsuitable for use as drinking and potable water supply. Communities within the basin thus rely heavily on groundwater as sources for drinking and domestic purposes. However, sulphide rocks that contain gold ore, which is prevalent in the area often contain pyrite and <b>arsenopyrites.</b> Exposure of these rocks to the atmosphere often results in acid mine drainage generation (low pH waters) and subsequent mobilization of trace metals in high proportions into the groundwater system. The indiscriminate use of Hg and other chemicals through “small-scale” mining activities within the basin also lead to the pollution of surface- and groundwater resources. The resultant of all these is {{the change in the}} characteristics of both surface-and groundwater resources which serve as sources of potable water supply to the communities that rely on them. Earlier studies within the basin include: Catchment-Based Monitoring Project in Ghana-National IWRM Plan (2010), Ahialey et al. (2010), Bayitse (2011) and Tay et al. (2014, 2015). These studies failed to apply multivariate statistical methods to unveil the hidden structures and subsequently delineate the factors responsible for groundwater pollution within the Lower Pra Basin.|$|R
25|$|Minerals {{with the}} formula MAsS and MAs2 (M = Fe, Ni, Co) are the {{dominant}} commercial sources of arsenic, together with realgar (an arsenic sulfide mineral) and native arsenic. An illustrative mineral is <b>arsenopyrite</b> (FeAsS), which is structurally related to iron pyrite. Many minor As-containing minerals are known. Arsenic also occurs in various organic {{forms in the}} environment.|$|E
25|$|Most {{arsenic oxide}} is, however, {{obtained}} as a volatile by-product of {{the processing of}} other ores. For example, <b>arsenopyrite,</b> a common impurity in gold- and copper-containing ores, liberates arsenic trioxide upon heating in air. The processing of such minerals has led to numerous cases of poisonings. Only in China are arsenic ores intentionally mined.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} iron, copper, arsenic and zinc ores such as <b>arsenopyrite,</b> pyrrhotite, pyrite and {{chalcopyrite}} with sphalerite, are present as small veins and in quartz veins throughout north-trending shear zones that cut the iron-rich tholeiitic basalts of the Arsenic Lake Formation. Dikes composed of quartz-feldspar porphyry run parallel to or lie within the shear zones and are {{cut by the}} mineralization. Chalcopyrite occupies later fractures which intersect massive <b>arsenopyrite.</b> Sparse quartz veins normally exist in or adjacent to the arsenopyrite-rich zones. Several northeast-trending deformation zones intersect pyroxenite of a mafic sill in northwest Strathy Township. Within these high-strain zones quartz veins normally contain chalcopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite with exsolved pentlandite and traces of sphalerite and galena. Chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and pentlandite are deposited throughout shear zones which lack quartz veining. These zones are not known to contain large amounts of gold, although investigations are incomplete. It is also unknown if platinum group metals (which include platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium and ruthenium) exist in these zones because no searches for platinum group elements have been undertaken.|$|E
40|$|The recent {{availability}} of an incomplete genomic sequence from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans {{allowed us to}} continue and strengthen the demanding task of investigating the proteome and its functional implications in this extremophilic microorganism. The proteins of At. ferrooxidans were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and their levels of synthesis and the microsequencing of their N-terminal end amino acids were determined. To link the 2 D gel spots of interest with the genes that encodes them, we studied the global changes in gene expression of At. ferrooxidans when the bacterium was confronted with phosphate starvation. By comparing the amino acid sequences of the proteins whose synthesis was induced or repressed under these conditions, with the available At. ferrooxidans genomic database, we found several putative genes whose expression {{may be related to}} phosphate starvation. Analysis of the genome DNA sequences upstream and downstream of these genes showed us details of the structure of putative operons present in At. ferrooxidans, strongly suggesting the existence of a Pho regulon containing the putative genes phoB, phoR, pstS, pstC,pstA, pYtB, phoU, ppx and ppk. Some differences were seen in the organization of the genes in the possible Pho regulon of At. ferrooxidans when compared with the Pho operons from other microorganisms. This was specially evident in the organization of the genes involved in polyphosphate metabolism (ppk and ppx). Regulation of phosphate metabolism is of particular relevance when At, ferrooxidans grows in the presence of <b>arsenopyrites,</b> which release arsenate, a structural analog of phosphate. Structural comparison between the specific phosphate-binding protein PstS from Escherichia coli and the corresponding At. ferrooxidans homolog showed that both proteins are highly conserved, including the phosphate/arsenate binding site, which shares seven of the eight amino acid residues necessary for the hydrogen bonding to the four oxygens of phosphate...|$|R
40|$|The gold {{deposits}} of the Ouro Preto area (Minas Gerais, Brazil) occur {{along the main}} tectonic contact responsible for the thrusting of the Paleoproterozoic units (Minas Supergroup) onto the gneissic and metasedimentary Archean units (Rio das Velhas Supergroup) during the Brasiliano (ca. 600 Ma) tectonic event. These deposits are {{claimed to be the}} most complex of the Quadrilátero Ferrífero, with orebodies lying parallel to the thrust-related stretching lineation. Based on structural, mineralogical, geochronological, and fluid inclusion constraints, our study demonstrates that the gold-bearing quartz veins were formed in response to late orogenic collapse tectonics that led, in this area, to gravity backsliding of the nappes. During these movements, sigmoidal voids were created and filled by elongate quartz grains associated with sulfides, tourmaline, and carbonates. Inferred hydrothermal effects were responsible for the formation of illite, sulfides, carbonate, garnet, and green biotite within the matrix. Large <b>arsenopyrites</b> within the veins were affected by three stages of fracturing during which the metallic phases and associated gold were deposited. Gold, wherever it is in contact with Bi-related minerals, occurs in the form of electrum, maldonite, or aurostibite. Fluid inclusion studies show that this event was associated with the entrapment of both CO 2 -rich and H 2 O salt-rich fluids. The process was initiated after the Brasiliano thrusting event (ca. 500 °C, 8 kbars) and in P-T conditions close to 300 ° to 400 °C and 2 kbars. An age of ca. 485 to 490 Ma has been obtained by 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of hydrothermal biotite and muscovite. This study demonstrates that the Ouro Preto gold deposits were formed in a context of late orogenic collapse tectonics, drastically different from the conventional auriferous shear zone model. This could account for their relative paucity compared to other mesothermal gold deposits...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the nearby}} Potts Gill Mine, Caldbeck Fells, Cumbria, on dumps from the Endeavor level, {{it has been}} found as minute, pearly, lath-like {{crystals}} in fractures in arsenopyrite-rich dolomite.

2500|$|The {{mineralization}} at Big Dan {{was discovered}} around 1900 when {{the area was}} being surveyed for the Ontario Northland Railway route. It is situated in the north-south trending Big Dan Shear Zone, a [...] long fault shear that intersects the mine site. Here, sparse massive veinlets of <b>arsenopyrite</b> with minor chalcopyrite, pyrite and pyrrhotite are present. Minor traces of gold and silver ore with sporadic nickel, copper and zinc values also exist in the shear zone.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mineralization}} at Beanland {{was discovered}} by Paul Hermiston and Robert McCauley in 1934. It is situated in a vertical dipping quartz vein network that is [...] long and has a maximum width of [...] Two types of mineralization exist, one type being auriferous quartz-carbonate veins with combinations of pyrite, galena, sphalerite and chalcopyrite present. The other is a simpler quartz vein {{with a combination of}} chalcopyrite, <b>arsenopyrite</b> and pyrite mineralization. The auriferous pyrite-sulfide quartz veins are the most important mineral structures and most of the underground development work was performed on them, including the Beanland Vein. These quartz veins are on the southeastern margin of the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone, which is known for a high frequency of gold occurrences.|$|E
2500|$|Arsenic has {{a similar}} {{electronegativity}} and ionization energies to its lighter congener phosphorus and as such readily forms covalent molecules {{with most of the}} nonmetals. Though stable in dry air, arsenic forms a golden-bronze tarnish upon exposure to humidity which eventually becomes a black surface layer. When heated in air, arsenic oxidizes to arsenic trioxide; the fumes from this reaction have an odor resembling garlic. This odor can be detected on striking arsenide minerals such as <b>arsenopyrite</b> with a hammer. It burns in oxygen to form arsenic trioxide and arsenic pentoxide, which have the same structure as the more well-known phosphorus compounds, and in fluorine to give arsenic pentafluoride. Arsenic (and some arsenic compounds) sublimes upon heating at atmospheric pressure, converting directly to a gaseous form without an intervening liquid state at [...] The triple point is 3.63MPa and [...] Arsenic makes arsenic acid with concentrated nitric acid, arsenous acid with dilute nitric acid, and arsenic trioxide with concentrated sulfuric acid; however, it does not react with water, alkalis, or non-oxidising acids. Arsenic reacts with metals to form arsenides, though these are not ionic compounds containing the As3− ion as the formation of such an anion would be highly endothermic and even the group 1 arsenides have properties of intermetallic compounds. Like germanium, selenium, and bromine, which like arsenic succeed the 3d transition series, arsenic is much less stable in the group oxidation state of +5 than its vertical neighbors phosphorus and antimony, and hence arsenic pentoxide and arsenic acid are potent oxidizers.|$|E
2500|$|The TGB {{contains}} massive banded iron formations {{and several}} precious metal and base metal deposits. The banded iron formations range from [...] to [...] {{to more than}} [...] thick. Remnants of volcanic vents are an important locator for mineral potential in the Temagami belt because they are adjacent to rocks that contain certain types of mineralization. At the Link Lake Formation, good evidence for copper-zinc massive sulfide deposits has been discovered in associated volcanic rocks. Some gold mineralization may also be associated with volcanic vents. Studies of greenstone terranes in the Superior craton have shown that large gold deposits are associated with regional deformation zones. Therefore, the Northeast Arm Deformation Zone, the Link Lake Shear Zone and the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone are obvious high potential areas. A number of scattered pyrite deposits can be found throughout the Northeast Arm Deformation Zone. The high frequency of gold mineralization in and near the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone suggests that this deformation zone may very well also contain gold deposits; at least 11 have been discovered within a [...] length of the deformation zone. The gold deposits are found in many rock types, indicating a stronger gold-bearing system with the potential of larger gold deposits. A number of gold-pyrite deposits exist in felsic volcanic rocks overlying the Older Volcanic Complex, near and on the northwestern part of the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. These deposits were likely formed during {{the creation of the}} Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. At the Younger Volcanic Complex, gold exists in quartz veins containing base metal sulfides. It is also known to exist in pyrite associated with deformed magnetite-rich iron formations, sericitized and carbonatized felsic volcanic rock, quartz-pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite-pentlandite-pyrite zones within deformation zones and in north-trending, chloritized shear zones containing <b>arsenopyrite,</b> pyrrhotite, pyrite and chalcopyrite.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Arsenopyrite</b> is an iron arsenic sulfide (FeAsS). It {{is a hard}} (Mohs 5.5-6) metallic, opaque, steel grey to silver white mineral with a {{relatively}} high specific gravity of 6.1. [...] When dissolved in nitric acid, it releases elemental sulfur. When <b>arsenopyrite</b> is heated, it becomes magnetic and gives off toxic fumes. With 46% arsenic content, <b>arsenopyrite,</b> along with orpiment, is a principal ore of arsenic. When deposits of <b>arsenopyrite</b> become exposed to the atmosphere, usually due to mining, the mineral will slowly oxidize, converting the arsenic into oxides that are more soluble in water, leading to acid mine drainage.|$|E

50|$|From the {{perspective}} of classical inorganic chemistry, which assigns formal oxidation states to each atom, pyrite is probably best described as Fe2+S22−.

In contrast, molybdenite, MoS2, features isolated sulfide (S2−) centers and the oxidation state of molybdenum is Mo4+. The mineral <b>arsenopyrite</b> has the formula FeAsS. Whereas pyrite has S2 subunits, <b>arsenopyrite</b> has AsS units, formally derived from deprotonation of H2AsSH.
