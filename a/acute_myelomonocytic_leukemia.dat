40|$|Interleukin 1 (IL- 1) or lymphocyte-activating factor, a {{monokine}} {{released in}} vitro by cultured monocytes or macrophages, acts {{on a variety}} of somatic and immunerelated target cells in a genetically unrestricted manner (1 - 5). It has long been recognized that fibroblasts appear at sites of inflammatory reactions after macrophages and play a pivotal role in the repair of damaged connective tissue by synthesizing and remodeling components of the matrix (e. g., collagens, fibronectin, and proteoglycans) (6). In this report, we have observed that IL- 1 is a potent stimulator of fibroblast collagenase production in vitro. This finding suggests that ILl may be a major effector molecule by which macrophages modulate not only fibroblast growth but collagenase production as well (4, 5). Materials and Methods IL- 1 Purification. In preliminary studies, we found that IL- 1 isolated from normal human peripheral blood monocytes was contaminated by lymphokines (personal observation by A.

40|$|Objective: Unusual {{clinical}} course Background: Renal {{failure is}} a common presentation of <b>acute</b> <b>myelomonocytic</b> and monocytic <b>leukemia.</b> It is usually the re-sult of a combined glomerular and tubular dysfunction and {{is associated with a}} poor prognosis. No guidelines exist for treatment. Case Report: We herein describe the case of a 78 -year-old Caucasian man who presented with acute myeloid leukemia M 5, leukostasis with a white count of 340 000 /ml, and acute renal failure with a creatinine of 7. 7 /dL. The patient was initially treated with leukapheresis and 3 days of idarubicin in the setting of continuous renal replacement therapy that resulted in rapid reversal of his renal failure. He then received 7 days of continuous infusion cy-tarabine and went into a complete remission. Conclusions: Renal failure may complicate the presentation of AML but can be reversible with treatment. Dose adjustment of the chemotherapy is not needed and the treatment can be greatly facilitated with the use of continuous renal replacement therapy, as indicated in our case report. In addition, we emphasize that organ dysfunction, even in elderly patients, is not necessarily a contraindication to aggressive treatment if it is felt to be disease...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{myeloid leukemia}} arising from chronic <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> is {{currently}} classified as {{acute myeloid leukemia}} with myelodysplasia-related changes, a high-risk subtype. However, the specific features of these cases have not been well described. We studied 38 patients with chronic <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> who progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. We compared the clinicopathologic and genetic features of these cases with 180 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia and 34 patients with acute myeloid leukemia following myelodysplastic syndromes. We also examined features associated with progression from chronic <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> to <b>acute</b> myeloid leukemia by comparing the progressed chronic <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> cases with a cohort of chronic <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> cases that did not transform to acute myeloid leukemia. Higher white blood cell count, marrow cellularity, karyotype risk score, and Revised International Prognostic Scoring System score were associated with more rapid progression from chronic <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> to <b>acute</b> myeloid leukemia. Patients with acute myeloid <b>leukemia</b> ex chronic <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> were older (P< 0. 01) {{and less likely to}} receive aggressive treatment (P= 0. 02) than de novo acute myeloid leukemia patients. Most cases showed monocytic differentiation and fell into the intermediate acute myeloid leukemia karyotype risk group; 55 % had normal karyotype and 17 % had NPM 1 mutation. Median overall survival was 6 months, which was inferior to de novo acute myeloid leukemia (17 months, P= 0. 002) but similar to post myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia. On multivariate analysis of all acute myeloid leukemia patients, only age and karyotype were independent prognostic variables for overall survival. Our findings indicate that acute myeloid <b>leukemia</b> following chronic <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> displays aggressive behavior and support placement of these cases within the category of acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes. The poor prognosis of these patients may be related to an older population and lack of favorable-prognosis karyotypes that characterize many de novo acute myeloid leukemia cases...|$|R

50|$|Acute {{myeloblastic leukemia}} (AML) {{is a group}} of {{malignant}} bone marrow neoplasms of myeloidprecursors of white blood cells. <b>Acute</b> <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (AML-M4) is a common type of pediatric AML. However, the condition is rare and represents approximately 3% of all leukemias during childhood and has an incidence of 1.1 - 1.7 per million per year. The symptoms may be aspecific: asthenia, pallor, fever, dizziness and respiratory symptoms. More specific symptoms are bruises and/or (excessive) bleeding, coagulation disorders (DIC), neurological disorders and gingival hyperplasia. Diagnostic methods include blood analysis, bone marrow aspirate for cytochemical, immunological and cytogeneticalanalysis, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) investigations. A characteristic chromosomal abnormalityobserved in AML-M4 is inv(16). Treatment includes intensive multidrug chemotherapy and in selected cases allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Nevertheless, outcome of AML remains poor with anoverall survival of 35-60%. Children with AML-M4 carrying the inv(16) abnormality have a better prognosis (61% 5-year overall survival).

40|$|Background. Chronic <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> {{is close}} to, but {{separate}} from both myeloproliferative neoplasms and myelodysplastic syndromes, and shows either myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic features. We ask whether this distinction {{may have a}} molecular basis. Design and Methods. We established the gene expression profiles of 39 samples of chronic <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (including 12 CD 34 -positive) and 32 CD 34 -positive samples of myelodysplastic syndromes by using Affymetrix microarrays, and studied the status of 18 genes by Sanger sequencing and array-comparative genomic hybridization in 53 samples. Results. Analysis of 12 mRNAS from chronic <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> established a gene expression signature of 122 probe sets differentially expressed between proliferative and dysplastic cases of chronic <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia.</b> As compared to the former, the latter overexpressed genes involved in red blood cell biology. When applied to 32 myelodysplastic syndromes this gene expression signature was able to discriminate refractory anemias with ring sideroblasts from refractory anemias with excess of blasts. By comparing mRNAS from these two forms of myelodysplastic syndromes we derived a second gene expression signature. This signature separated the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative forms of chronic <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemias.</b> These results were validated by using two independent gene expression data sets. We found that myelodysplastic chronic <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> are characterized by mutations in transcription/epigenetic regulators (ASXL 1, RUNX 1, TET 2) and splicing genes (SRSF 2) {{and the absence of}} mutations in signaling genes.

40|$|Chronic <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> is a clonal {{stem cell}} {{disorder}} that is characterized mainly by absolute peripheral monocytosis. This disease can present myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic characteristics. According to the classification {{established by the}} World Health Organization, chronic <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> is inserted {{in a group of}} myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorders; its diagnosis requires the presence of persistent monocytosis and dysplasia involving one or more myeloid cell lineages. Furthermore, there should be an absence of the Philadelphia chromosome and the BCR/ABL fusion gene and less than 20 % blasts in the blood or bone marrow. Phenotypically, the cells in chronic <b>myelomonocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> can present <b>myelomonocytic</b> antigens, such as CD 33 and CD 13, overexpressions of CD 56 and CD 2 and variable expressions of HLA-DR, CD 36, CD 14, CD 15, CD 68 and CD 64.
