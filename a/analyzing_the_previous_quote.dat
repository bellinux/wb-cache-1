30|$|This was a {{question}} where instructor M never expressed {{anything other than a}} traditional view of the teacher controlling the direction of class. Every answer reflected the idea of sticking to the syllabus, from “I guess when I’m setting up the syllabus…” on the pre-course interview to “I decide when I’m making up my syllabus what topics I want to cover; I move on according to the syllabus rather than whether or not they’re getting it, and that’s probably wrong” on the post-course interview.

Just as the outcomes of an instructional strategy can impact a teacher’s beliefs or attitudes, these changes in the personal domain can change how an instructor views certain outcomes. For instructor M who initially had a very traditional lecture style, stopping to let students talk and work together was something that was uncomfortable for her and signaled a loss of control, and she viewed it as a negative outcome. As seen in some of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>quotes,</b> she is starting to become more comfortable with the idea of student talk and activity in the classroom and beginning to view it as a positive outcome indicative of increased engagement.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This article {{seeks to}} shed {{new light on}} our {{understanding}} of the work of the film producer, discussing the creative nature of this craft. It does that by searching for answers to two questions: Firstly, up to what point can we talk about creativity in the producing of films? And secondly, how is that creativity practiced? To deal with both these questions it offers a historical overview of the creative producer and how it is presently considered. Finally, it also briefly addresses the influence of digital revolution in the production process. The ‘Unsung Heroes’ “Most people have absolutely no concept of what producers do, even people in the film business…” ⎯BARBARA BROCCOLI (co-producer of James Bond movies). “Every producer is different ⎯it’s been so different on every movie that I’ve worked on.

However, {{in that case}} something is wrong, there is something contradictory in the memories of Imrich Vida and Michal Kovács: “The interest was great, and after all, we urged the youth to play, too!” The idea of founding our own team came up immediately; however, some basic statutes would have been necessary for that, {{but we did not}} have available anything like that.

The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Then the Service reached its central episode with the Te Deum sung to Sir Arthur Sullivan’s music, deprived, through {{the absence of}} strings, of its full orchestral beauty, but wrought up from exquisite tenderness to a pitch of dignity and strength." [...] Note the reference in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>quote</b> to <b>the</b> absence of strings: The cathedral was unable to procure a suitable string section, and so the Te Deum was premiered without strings. [...] The Musical Times was also favourably impressed by the piece:In every page of the score we can trace {{the hand of the}} skilled musician, once a Chorister of the Chapel Royal. Moreover the work is impregnated with a robustness distinctly national in the directness of its diatonic expression. The introduction of the composer's familiar hymn tune 'Onward Christian Soldiers' — first in fragments and afterwards in its entirety — infuses a military element into this Thanksgiving Te Deum, the significance of which is obvious.|$|R

3000|$|Some {{interviewees}} articulated that interracial {{marriage with}} adoptees would be “easier” than with someone of migrant background {{due to the}} lack of cultural differences. The remark that it is easier to have a relationship with an adoptee is interesting. While the comment indicates that adoptees’ cultural similarity with Swedes makes the relationship “easier”, compared to having a relationship with someone of migrant origin, it also infers that there is something about adoptees that makes a relationship with them somehow different to a relationship with white Swedes. I argue this not only because of the comparison that it is “easier” but also because none of the interviewees specifically articulated that having a relationship with adoptees is the same as having a relationship with someone of a Swedish origin, even though interviewees were convinced that “adoptees are Swedes”. What <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>quote</b> and several others below express is that these differences infer the racial and visible differences. While looking at the survey results, one interviewee stated that the attitudes toward adoptees “then only have to do with the physical, like skin color and appearance, hair color, whatever it might be.” Another interviewee determinedly expressed the following in response to the non-existing differences in attitudes towards adoptees and migrants: [...]...|$|R
