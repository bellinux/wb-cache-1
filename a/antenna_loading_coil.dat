5000|$|The {{equivalent}} circuit of the <b>antenna</b> (including <b>loading</b> <b>coil)</b> is the series {{combination of the}} capacitive reactance of the antenna, the inductive reactance of the <b>loading</b> <b>coil,</b> and the radiation resistance and the other resistances of the antenna-ground circuit. So the input impedance is ...|$|R
5000|$|... 27 MHz is a {{relatively}} long wavelength for mobile communications, and the choice of antenna has a considerable impact {{on the performance of}} a CB radio. A common mobile antenna is a quarter-wave vertical whip. This is roughly nine feet (2.7 m) tall; it is mounted low on the vehicle body, and often has a spring-and-ball mount to enhance its flexibility when scraping or striking overhead objects. Where a nine-foot whip is undesirable, shorter <b>antennas</b> include <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> to make the antenna impedance the same as a physically longer <b>antenna.</b> The <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> may be on the bottom, middle, or top of the antenna, while some antennas are wound in a continuously-loaded helix.|$|R
30|$|Ni-Cd ferrite, is a soft {{magnetic}} material, with a spinel {{crystal structure}} with widespread applications in recording heads, <b>antenna</b> rods, <b>loading</b> <b>coils,</b> microwave devices, core material for power transformers {{due to their}} high resistivity and low eddy current losses [11 – 13]. Nanocrystalline soft ferrites exhibit high coercivities and low saturation magnetization {{compared to the other}} conventional ferrites [14].|$|R
2500|$|So {{to make an}} {{electrically}} short <b>antenna</b> resonant, a <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> {{is inserted}} in series with the antenna. [...] The inductive reactance of the coil is equal and opposite to, and cancels, the capacitive reactance of the <b>antenna,</b> so the <b>loaded</b> <b>antenna</b> presents a pure resistance to the transmission line, preventing energy from being reflected.|$|R
5000|$|At low {{frequencies}} (such as AM broadcast), arrays of vertical towers {{are used to}} achieve directionality [...] and they will occupy large areas of land. For reception, a long Beverage antenna can have significant directivity. For non directional portable use, a short vertical antenna or small loop antenna works well, with the main design challenge being that of impedance matching. With a vertical <b>antenna</b> a <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> {{at the base of}} the antenna may be employed to cancel the reactive component of impedance; small loop antennas are tuned with parallel capacitors for this purpose.|$|R
5000|$|To {{reduce the}} length of a whip antenna to make it less cumbersome, an {{inductor}} (<b>loading</b> <b>coil)</b> is often added in series with it. This allows the antenna to be made much shorter than the normal length of a quarter-wavelength, and still be resonant, by cancelling out the capacitive reactance of the short antenna. The coil is added {{at the base of the}} whip (called a base-loaded whip) or occasionally in the middle (center-loaded whip). In the most widely used form, the rubber ducky <b>antenna,</b> the <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> is integrated with the antenna itself by making the whip out of a narrow helix of springy wire. The helix distributes the inductance along the antenna's length, improving the radiation pattern, and also makes it more flexible. Another alternative occasionally used to shorten the antenna is to add a [...] "capacity hat", a metal screen or radiating wires, at the end. However all these electrically short whips have lower gain than a full length quarter-wave whip.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the ground}} waves {{used in this}} band require {{vertical}} polarization, vertical antennas are used for transmission, usually mast radiators, either insulated {{from the ground and}} fed at the bottom, or occasionally fed through guy-wires. T-antennas and inverted L-antennas are used when antenna height is an issue. Nearly all LF antennas are electrically short, shorter than one quarter of the radiated wavelength, so their low radiation resistance makes them inefficient, requiring very low resistance grounds and conductors to avoid dissipating transmitter power. These electrically short <b>antennas</b> need <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> of high inductance to bring them into resonance. Many antenna types, such as the umbrella antenna and L- and T-antenna, use capacitive top-loading (a [...] "top hat"), {{in the form of a}} network of horizontal wires attached to the top of the vertical radiator. The capacitance improves the efficiency of the antenna without increasing its height or its supporting structures.|$|R

In this context a line without <b>load</b> <b>coils</b> {{is referred to as}} an unloaded line.|$|R
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined This paper {{deals with}} {{detection}} and localization of <b>load</b> <b>coils</b> in the copper access network. The <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> is a legacy device {{that must be}} removed before deploying broadband services on twisted-pair transmission lines. The proposed methods do not require dedicated hardware but utilize the already installed transceivers for one-port measurements of the line input impedance. The number of <b>load</b> <b>coils</b> is detected by {{counting the number of}} resonance peaks in the line impedance spectrum. An approximative model of the symmetric loaded line is presented, from which a low-complexity <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> locator is derived. For nonsymmetric lines, a <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> locator using model-based optimization is proposed. The two methods are compared and evaluated by computer simulations and by laboratory measurements on real transmission lines. The estimation results indicate that up to five <b>load</b> <b>coils</b> can be robustly detected and located with the proposed methods...|$|R
50|$|Because DSL {{operates}} {{above the}} 3.4 kHz voice limit, it cannot {{pass through a}} <b>load</b> <b>coil,</b> which is an inductive coil {{that is designed to}} counteract loss caused by shunt capacitance (capacitance between the two wires of the twisted pair). <b>Load</b> <b>coils</b> are commonly set at regular intervals in lines placed only for POTS. A DSL signal cannot pass through a properly installed and working <b>load</b> <b>coil,</b> while voice service cannot be maintained past a certain distance without such coils. Therefore, some areas that are within range for DSL service are disqualified from eligibility because of <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> placement. Because of this, phone companies endeavor to remove <b>load</b> <b>coils</b> on copper loops that can operate without them, and by conditioning other lines to avoid them through the use of fiber to the neighborhood or node (FTTN).|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "multiple-tuned flattop antenna" [...] is {{a variant}} of the T antenna used in high power low {{frequency}} transmitters to reduce ground power losses. [...] It consists of a long capacitive top-load consisting of multiple parallel wires supported by a line of transmission towers, sometimes several miles long. Several vertical radiator wires hang down from the top-load, each attached to its own ground through a <b>loading</b> <b>coil.</b> The <b>antenna</b> is driven either at one of the radiator wires, or more often {{at one end of the}} top-load, by bringing the wires of the top-load diagonally down to the transmitter. Although the vertical wires are separated, the distance between them is small compared to the length of the LF waves, so the currents in them are in phase and they can be considered as one radiator. Since the antenna current flows into the ground through N parallel <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> and grounds rather than one, the equivalent <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> and ground resistance, and therefore the power dissipated in the <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> and ground, is reduced to 1/N that of a simple T antenna. [...] The antenna was used in the powerful radio stations of the wireless telegraphy era but has fallen out of favor due to the expense of multiple <b>loading</b> <b>coils.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{required}} {{increase in}} L {{is achieved by}} loading the cable with a metal with high magnetic permeability. It is also possible to load a cable of conventional construction by adding discrete <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> at regular intervals. This is not identical to a distributed loading, the difference being that with <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> there is distortionless transmission up to a definite cut-off frequency beyond which the attenuation increases rapidly.|$|R
50|$|Without <b>loading</b> <b>coils,</b> {{the line}} {{response}} {{is dominated by}} the resistance and capacitance of the line with the attenuation gently increasing with frequency. With <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> of exactly the right inductance, neither capacitance nor inductance dominate: the response is flat, waveforms are undistorted and the characteristic impedance is resistive up to the cutoff frequency. The coincidental formation of an audio frequency filter is also beneficial in that noise is reduced.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a magnetic resonance {{wireless power transfer}} (WPT) system that uses three coils, a planar receiver and operates at 6. 78 MHz,. Effective power transfer is ensured by establishing an impedance matching condition for this WPT system. A metamaterial (MTM) array having dimensions of 20 cm. 30 cm is also positioned near the <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> to concentrate the magnetic field and enhance the transfer efficiency.

The highest transfer efficiency improvement is about 55 % at a distance of 20 cm with the ground plane.

50|$|Since it is {{shorter than}} λ/4 the T antenna {{has a high}} {{capacitive}} reactance. In transmitting antennas, to make the antenna resonant {{so it can be}} driven efficiently, this capacitance must be canceled out by adding an inductor, a <b>loading</b> <b>coil,</b> in series with the bottom of the antenna. Particularly at lower frequencies, the high inductance and capacitance compared to its low radiation resistance makes the <b>loaded</b> <b>antenna</b> behave like a high Q tuned circuit, with a narrow bandwidth over which it will remain impedance matched to the transmission line, compared to a λ/4 monopole. To operate over a large frequency range the <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> often must be adjustable, and adjusted when the frequency is changed to keep the SWR low. The high Q also causes a high voltage on the antenna, roughly Q times the driving-point voltage. The insulators at the ends must be designed to withstand these voltages. In high power transmitters the output power is often limited by the onset of corona discharge on the wires.|$|R
2500|$|A common {{application}} of <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> {{is to improve}} the voice-frequency amplitude response characteristics of the twisted balanced pairs in a telephone cable. [...] Because twisted pair is a balanced format, half the <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> must be inserted in each leg of the pair to maintain the balance. [...] It is common for both these windings to be formed on the same core. [...] This increases the flux linkages, without which the number of turns on the coil would need to be increased.|$|R
5000|$|In 1897 Campbell went to {{work for}} AT&T in Boston. He {{developed}} a method for transmitting analog telephony over much greater distances than had previously been possible by the insertion of <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> into the line at carefully calculated intervals to increase the inductance. Engineer Michael I. Pupin also patented a similar system and AT&T paid Pupin a very large sum for his patents, so that development would continue without a legal battle. In fact, neither man was the first to suggest the idea of <b>loading</b> <b>coils,</b> that credit goes to Oliver Heaviside in an 1887 article. [...] Heaviside, however, never patented the idea; indeed, he took no commercial advantage of any of his brilliant work. [...] Despite the rather arcane legal arguments surrounding this, it is unquestionable that Campbell was the first to actually construct a telephone circuit using <b>loading</b> <b>coils.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Unloaded phantom is {{a phantom}} {{configuration}} of loaded lines (a circuit fitted with <b>loading</b> <b>coils).</b> The idea {{here is not}} to create additional circuits. Rather, the purpose is to cancel or greatly reduce the effect of the <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> fitted to a line. The reason for doing this is that loaded lines have a definite cut-off frequency and it may be desired to equalise the line to a frequency which is higher than this, for example to make a circuit suitable for use by a broadcaster. Ideally, the loading would be removed or reduced for a permanent connection, but this is not feasible for temporary arrangements such as a requirement for outside broadcast. Instead, two circuits in a phantom configuration can be used to greatly reduce the inductance being inserted by the <b>loading</b> <b>coils,</b> and hence the loading effect.|$|R
