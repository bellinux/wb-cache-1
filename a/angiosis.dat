40|$|HISTORY: A 76 -year-old {{woman and}} a 62 -year-old man were both {{referred}} to our clinic because of an unexplained weight loss, increasing dry cough and shortness of breath. INVESTIGATIONS: Investigations revealed an adenocarcinoma of the colon with retroperitoneal, mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph node metastasis and poorly differentiated carcinoma of the prostate with extensive bone metastases. During their hospital stay both patients developed increasing shortness of breath and clinical signs of right heart failure. Echocardiography confirmed severe pulmonary hypertension and dilatation of the right ventricle in both patients. Despite {{the high degree of}} clinical suspicion CT scans of the thorax could not demonstrate pulmonary embolism. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: During the following days the patients condition deteriorated further and both patients' died from irreversible right heart failure. Both autopsies showed extensive metastatic adenocarcinoma with marked <b>angiosis</b> carcinomatosa of the lungs with numerous occlusions of small arteries and arterioles and resulting cor pulmonale. Thrombotic pulmonary embolism could not be detected. CONCLUSION: In patients with malignant neoplasms, especially adenocarcinomas, dyspnea and signs of increasing pulmonary artery pressure, the possibility of a microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism should be considered after exclusion of more usual causes especially thrombotic pulmonary embolism. In selected cases a cytologic examination of blood aspirated from a wedged pulmonary artery catheter can be performed to prove <b>angiosis</b> is carcinomatosa...|$|E
40|$|Uteri from 50 necropsied nonpregnant Japanese Thoroughbred brood mares (1 â€“ 30 {{years of}} age) were {{investigated}} {{to clarify the}} histopathological characteristics of endometrosis in Japanese Thoroughbred mares and the distribution pattern of endometrosis lesions in the uterus as a whole. Endometrosis was observed in all animals over 6 {{years of age and}} in all of the 21 mares aged over 12 years of age. The affected mares showed elastofibrosis of arteries, veins and lymphatic vessels in the uterine wall, atrophy of the uterine smooth muscle layers and hyperplasia of collagen fibers among the smooth muscle fascicles of the myometrium, in addition to pathomorphologic features of endometrosis such as stromal endometrial fibrosis accompanied by endometrial atrophy, periglandular fibrosis and reduction of uterine glands. The severity of the histopathological changes increased with advancing age. Lymphatic vessels with elastofibrosis showed marked lymph congestion, leading to lymphatic edema. With increasing age, the extent of the distribution of these lesions tended to expand from focal to diffuse involvement of the entire uterus. Based on these findings, we speculate that aging plays a role in the pathogenesis of endometrosis; circulatory disturbances due to intrauterine <b>angiosis</b> or angiopathy, particularly reduction of the arterial blood supply and disturbance of venous drainage, resulting in a reduction of lymphatic drainage (lymphatic edema), are closely related to the onset and progression of endometrial fibrosis and myometrial atrophy with fibroplasia may result in myometrial hypofunction during the peri-implantation or puerperal period...|$|E
