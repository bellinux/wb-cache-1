5|$|The American effort {{increased}} {{rapidly and}} soon outstripped the British as the American authorities {{were reluctant to}} share details with their British counterparts. However, separate research continued in each country with some exchange of information. Several of the key British scientists visited the United States early in 1942 and were given full access to <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> available. They were astounded at the momentum that the American atomic bomb project had then assumed. The British and American exchange of information and efforts continued but the nations did not combine their efforts, leading their programmes separately. Furthermore, in 1941 the British Government rebuffed and vetoed attempts and proposals by Bush and Conant to strengthen cooperation between Great Britain and America.|$|E

25|$|Several {{companies}} offered optional commercial feelies (physical props {{associated with}} a game). The tradition of 'Feelies' (and the term itself) {{is believed to have}} originated with Deadline (1982), the third Infocom title after Zork I and II. When writing this game, {{it was not possible to}} include <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> in the limited (80KB) disk space, so Infocom created the first feelies for this game; extra items that gave more information than could be included within the digital game itself. These included police interviews, the coroner's findings, letters, crime scene evidence and photos of the murder scene.|$|E
25|$|Constraint {{modeling}} theories concern {{families of}} directed graphs related by a partial order. In these applications, graphs are ordered by specificity, meaning that more constrained graphs—which are more specific and thus contain a {{greater amount of}} information—are subsumed by those that are more general. Operations between graphs include evaluating {{the direction of a}} subsumption relationship between two graphs, if any, and computing graph unification. The unification of two argument graphs is defined as the most general graph (or the computation thereof) that is consistent with (i.e. contains <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> in) the inputs, if such a graph exists; efficient unification algorithms are known.|$|E

25|$|Languages that do {{not have}} {{grammatical}} tense, such as Chinese, express time reference chiefly by lexical means – through adverbials, time phrases, and so on. (The same is done in tensed languages, to supplement or reinforce the time information conveyed by the choice of tense.) Time information is also sometimes conveyed as a secondary feature by markers of other categories, as with the Chinese aspect markers le and guo, which in most cases place an action in past time. However, much time information is conveyed implicitly by context – it is therefore not always necessary, when translating from a tensed to a tenseless language, say, to express explicitly in the target language <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> conveyed by the tenses in the source.|$|E
500|$|In June 1969, as the SS Manhattan {{traveled}} through the Northwest Passage, TAPS formally {{applied to the}} Interior Department for a permit to build an oil pipeline across [...] of public land—from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. The application was for a 100-foot (30.5 m) wide right of way to build a subterranean 48-inch (122-centimeter) pipeline including 11 pumping stations. Another right of way was requested to build a construction and maintenance highway paralleling the pipeline.

500|$|Fragile Allegiance was {{marketed as}} an intense deep space {{real-time}} strategy game complete with complex face-to-face diplomacy. It {{was the first}} game to use Gremlin Interactive's facial motion capture technology which allowed for highly detailed and realistic looking alien ambassadors, giving depth and adding atmosphere to the games diplomacy. Two versions of the game were released — a European version and a North American version, with each region having different box art. There were two different demo versions, one with audio and one without audio. A cheat code is available for the game and is entered slightly differently between the two versions. For the European version the code is [...] "FRAGILE /cKim.Jon.fmsti", while [...] "FRAGILE /c.Osiris.fmsti" [...] must be entered for the North American version. These codes reward the player with decreased construction time, extra money, {{the ability to see}} all asteroids in play, the ability to change the game speed in-game and gives the player access to <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> in the game.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Howard began issuing a {{correspondence}} course in {{a tradition of}} Wicca that he termed the Coven of Atho; in his position of leadership over the group, he termed himself [...] "The Fish". One subscriber was Valiente, who reached the lowest rank on the course, that of [...] "Sarsen", in 1963. She copied down <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> provided in the course into a notebook, highlighting that most of it appeared to derive from Dion Fortune's novel The Sea Priestess and Rufold Koch's The Book of Signs. Other possible sources include Gardner's Witchcraft Today, Charles Leland's Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches, and Lewis Spence's books on Atlantis. Howard revealed to Valiente that he had drawn elements from the Wiccan tradition practiced by the Cardells, and like their group he promoted a sevenfold system of ethics, although these virtues — presence, truth, kindliness, tolerance, awareness, strength, and perception — differed from those found in Cardell's tradition. It referred to magic with the spelling of [...] "magick", which had been popularised by the occultist Aleister Crowley, and promulgated [...] "Eight Paths of Magick", which {{was similar to the}} Eightfold Path taught in Gardnerian Wicca.|$|E
