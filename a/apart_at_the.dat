5|$|The skull is {{flattened}} {{in general}} shape. The front part {{is short and}} broad. The broad interorbital region (located between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped, with squared edges and weakly developed beading. A postorbital ridge is present, obscuring the suture (joint) between the frontal and squamosal bones, a feature shared only with Holochilus among oryzomyines. The braincase is squarish. The interparietal bone is wide, but does not reach the squamosals on the sides. The zygomatic arches, which are well-developed, are furthest <b>apart</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back and converge toward the front. The jugal bone is small.|$|E
5|$|The proto-Scotland landmass moved northwards, {{and from}} 460–430 Ma, sandstone, {{mudstone}} and limestone were {{deposited in the}} area that is now the Midland Valley. This occurred in shallow tropical seas at the margins of the Iapetus Ocean. The Ballantrae Complex near Girvan was formed from this ocean floor and is similar in composition to rocks found at The Lizard in Cornwall. Nonetheless, northern and southern Britain were far <b>apart</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of this period, although the gap began to close as the continent of Avalonia broke away from Gondwana, collided with Baltica and drifted towards Laurentia. The Caledonian orogeny began forming a mountain chain from Norway to the Appalachians. There was an ice age in the southern hemisphere, and the first mass extinction of life on Earth took place {{at the end of this}} period.|$|E

25|$|In the Dodge type jaw crushers, {{the jaws}} are farther <b>apart</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top {{than at the}} bottom, forming a tapered chute so that the {{material}} is crushed progressively smaller and smaller as it travels downward until it is small enough {{to escape from the}} bottom opening. The Dodge jaw crusher has a variable feed area and a fixed discharge area which leads to choking of the crusher and hence is used only for laboratory purposes and not for heavy duty operations.|$|E

25|$|The {{pilot film}} aired on November 7, 1975, was a ratings success, and ABC quickly {{authorized}} {{the production of}} two one-hour specials which aired in April 1976.

The network began airing the episodes every few weeks <b>apart</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the TV season in September 1976. After mid-December 1976, episodes aired on a weekly basis until mid-February 1977.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein and Hitler {{were born}} just six days apart, though Hitler had to re-sit his {{mathematics}} exam before being allowed into a higher class, while Wittgenstein was moved forward by one, so {{they ended up}} two grades <b>apart</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Realschule. Monk estimates they were both at the school during the 1904–1905 school year, but {{says there is no}} evidence they {{had anything to do with}} each other. Several commentators have argued that a school photograph of Hitler may show Wittgenstein in the lower left corner, but Hamann says the photograph stems from 1900 or 1901, before Wittgenstein's time.|$|E

Dummies and vehicles were easily reassembled. They prompted a one-hour television special, The Adventures of the Incredible Crash Dummies. Unique for its time, the cartoon was produced entirely using 3D computer animation techniques. A comic book series and a video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy were produced.|$|E

Simultaneously, Atlanta Spirit, LLC, the team's ownership group, was coming <b>apart</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> seams. A dispute between Steve Belkin and his seven fellow owners dated back to 2005; Belkin claimed the other owners breached their contract, giving him {{the right to buy}} them out at cost, while his partners said {{they should be able to}} buy out Belkin's 30% stake. On November 3, court proceedings began in Maryland to decide the group's fate.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable aspects of the design is the stadium's retractable, fabric roof. The roof {{mechanization}} consists of two large panels that split <b>apart</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 50yard line, lying over and above each end zone when fully retracted. 10 parallel, tri-chord trusses ride on two parallel rails, each supported by a large, -long super-truss. Roof operation is controlled in the stadium press box via computer, containing live images of the travel path of each roof panel; plus, furnishing live feedback from all roof components throughout the operation. The roof panels can be opened or closed {{in as little as}} 7minutes, moving at a speed of up to -per-minute.|$|E

25|$|In 1913, Percival E. Fansler {{brought in}} Benoist {{to start an}} air {{passenger}} service using Benoist Aircrafts new flying boats to connect St. Petersburg and Tampa, Florida, two cities that otherwise were a days travel <b>apart</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Benoist signed a three-month contract to provide the service with the St. Petersburg Board of Trade on 17 December 1913, subsidizing 50% of the costs for starting the airline. Benoist initiated the service, the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, using a Benoist XIV flying boat, on 1 January 1914. It was the first scheduled airline service in the world. Two Benoist XIVs provided twice-daily service across Tampa Bay {{and by the time}} the initial contract expired on 31 March 1914 had transported 1,204 passengers without injury, losing only four days to mechanical problems. A decline in business led the airline to shut down in late April 1914 and sell its two flying boats.|$|E
25|$|The World War II era {{also brought}} on rising {{production}} costs {{that resulted in}} a reduced number of elaborate gags and outdoor sequences, Del Lord's stock in trade; as such, the quality of the team's films (particularly those directed by Lord) began to slip after 1942. According to Okuda and Watz, entries such as Loco Boy Makes Good, What's the Matador?, Sock-A-Bye Baby (all 1942), I Can Hardly Wait and A Gem of a Jam (both 1943) are considered to be lesser quality works than previous films. Spook Louder (1943), a remake of Mack Sennett's The Great Pie Mystery (1931), is often cited as the Stooges' worst film because of its repetitious and rehashed jokes. Three Smart Saps (1942), a film considered to be an improvement, features a reworking of a routine from Harold Lloyd's The Freshman (1925), in which Curly's loosely basted suit begins to come <b>apart</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> seams while he is on the dance floor.|$|E

25|$|First, {{stakes were}} {{driven into the}} ground to roughly mark out the {{positions}} for the cast iron columns; these points were then set precisely by theodolite measurements. Then the concrete foundations were poured, and the base plates for the columns were set into them. Once the foundations were in place, the erection of the modules proceeded rapidly. Connector brackets were attached {{to the top of}} each column before erection, and these were then hoisted into position. Since the project took place before the development of powered cranes, the raising of the columns was done manually using shears (or shear legs), a simple crane mechanism. These consisted of two strong poles, which were set several metres <b>apart</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base and then lashed together at the top to form a triangle; this was stabilized and kept vertical by guy ropes fixed to the apex, stretched taut and tied to stakes driven into the ground some distance away. Using pulleys and ropes hung from the apex of the shear, the navvies hoisted the columns, girders and other parts into place.|$|E
25|$|In early 1997, Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland {{stated that}} he did not want to spend Connecticut {{taxpayer}} dollars to fund a new arena in Hartford. Despite this, negotiations between the Whalers and Rowland to build a new $147.5 million arena seemed to be going well. After a near-complete agreement, talks fell <b>apart</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last minute when Karmanos wanted an additional $45 million to cover losses during the three years the new arena was to be built. The Whalers ultimately announced that they would be leaving Hartford after the 1996–97 season. This marks one of the few times that a team announced it would leave its current city without having already announced an agreement with a new one. Karmanos had discussed relocating the Whalers to Norfolk, Virginia (which would have been the first major sports team for that market) as the Hampton Roads Rhinos, but the failure of a season-ticket drive in Norfolk, coupled with a lack of an adequate arena, led to those plans being canceled. Karmanos stated that Rowland had no intention making a serious offer to keep the Whalers in Connecticut since Rowland harbored hopes to bring a National Football League (NFL) franchise to the State. Rowland went on to negotiate a tentative deal that would bring the New England Patriots to Connecticut, but those talks also fell apart after the State and Patriots ownership failed to reach an agreement on a new stadium.|$|E
