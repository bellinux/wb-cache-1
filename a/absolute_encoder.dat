50|$|An <b>absolute</b> <b>encoder</b> has {{multiple}} code rings with various binary weightings which provide a data word representing the absolute {{position of the}} encoder within one revolution. This type of encoder {{is often referred to}} as a parallel <b>absolute</b> <b>encoder.</b>|$|E
50|$|Such {{encoders}} can {{be either}} absolute or incremental. The signal from an <b>absolute</b> <b>encoder</b> gives an unambiguous position within the travel range without requiring knowledge of any previous position. The signal from an incremental encoder is cyclical, thus ambiguous, and requires counting of cycles to maintain absolute position within the travel range. Both can provide the same accuracy, but the <b>absolute</b> <b>encoder</b> is more robust to interruptions in transducer signal.|$|E

In {{terms of}} <b>absolute</b> value <b>encoder</b> applications, SSI {{communication}} protocol, as an earlier implementation of communication protocol, {{has been widely}} used recently.

50|$|A {{multi-turn}} encoder {{can detect}} and store {{more than one}} revolution. The term <b>absolute</b> multi-turn <b>encoder</b> is generally used if the encoder will detect movements of its shaft even if the encoder is not provided with external power.|$|R
50|$|The disk of a {{pseudorandom}} encoder has an evenly spaced notch design just as {{an incremental}} encoder to measure distance. A second track of code is used to find the position just like an absolute encoder; however, an <b>absolute</b> <b>encoder</b> tells position from reading from multiple parallel tracks while a pseudorandom encoder uses one single track. This aspect allows pseudorandom rotary encoders to have smaller diameters and larger through-holes. To know its position, the encoder must first move a certain distance to read the code. This distance is generally small, about 1-2 degrees for rotary encoders and 1 mm for linear encoders, though this idiosyncrasy does hinder its usefulness in some applications such as track-balls since position is not immediately known when the system starts.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>absolute</b> <b>encoder</b> {{maintains}} {{position information}} when power {{is removed from}} the system. The position of the encoder is available immediately on applying power. The relationship between the encoder value and the physical position of the controlled machinery is set at assembly; the system does not need to return to a calibration point to maintain position accuracy. An [...] "incremental" [...] encoder accurately records changes in position, but does not power up with a fixed relation between encoder state and physical position. Devices controlled by incremental encoders may have to [...] "go home" [...] to a fixed reference point to initialize the position measurement. A multi-turn absolute rotary encoder includes additional code wheels and gears. A high-resolution wheel measures the fractional rotation, and lower-resolution geared code wheels record the number of whole revolutions of the shaft.|$|E

And {{the research of}} decoding system and algorithm {{are essential to the}} single-ring <b>absolute</b> <b>encoder.</b> In order to improve single-ring absolute photoelectric encoder&# 39;s circuit integration, response speed and accuracy, a decoding system was designed in this paper. Linear CCD was used in this system as the disc image receiving and photoelectric conversion device which also provided the basement of subdivision algorithm. And FPGA was used to achieve circuit control and decoding algorithm. A new decoding algorithm was also proposed in this paper. On the one hand, the coding information was achieved by counting high electrical level of the binaryzation signal of CCD&# 39;s output. Coding information was obtained by recognition of the disc image and combination of 12 -bits coding number. On the other hand, precise value was obtained by calculating the shifting between the centroid of image and virtual center. The centroid of stripe was calculated based on CCD centroid location algorithm. Finally, the value of angle was precisely received from combination of these two values.

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{approach}} of an optical type absolute rotary encoder coding pattern is presented. The concept {{is based on the}} principle of the <b>absolute</b> <b>encoder</b> to find out a unique sequence that ensures an unambiguous shaft position of any angular. We design a single-ring and a n-by- 2 matrix <b>absolute</b> <b>encoder</b> coding pattern by using the variations of Hamiltonian graph principle. 12 encoding bits is used in the single-ring by a linear array CCD to achieve an 1080 -position cycle encoding. Besides, a 2 -by- 2 matrix is used as an unit in the 2 -track disk to achieve a 16 -bits encoding pattern by using an area array CCD sensor (as a sample). Finally, a higher resolution can be gained by an electronic subdivision of the signals. Compared with the conventional gray or binary code pattern (for a 2 nresolution), this new pattern has a higher resolution (2 n∗n) with less coding tracks, which means the new pattern can lead to a smaller encoder, which is essential in the industrial production. © 2017 SPIE. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{rotary encoder}} reads {{rotational}} motion (angular position and speed) and converts the motion into electrical signals. It involves two components: a designed coded-disc to represents rotational {{information and a}} sensor to convert the coded information into electrical signals. A conventional rotary encoder uses three major elements, a pattern code disc, a light source and a photo-detector. Factors affecting rotary encoder are mechanical component alignments, resolution enhancement, size reduction, additional processing electronics and the working environment. Depending {{on the design of}} the coded-disc and the signal interpolation, a rotary encoder can function as an absolute or incremental encoder. An <b>absolute</b> <b>encoder</b> can determine the angular position without the need to have a reference position. On the other hand, an incremental encoder requires a reference position {{in order to determine the}} angular position. In operations, when an incremental encoder is started, the system has to move to the home position in order to set a reference point. An <b>absolute</b> <b>encoder</b> does not require home operations because it knows exactly the current angular position. As such, an incremental encoder requires an additional power supply when the system is turn-off so that it can “memorize” the current position. An <b>absolute</b> <b>encoder</b> is more expensive and the angular position range is limited by the disc size. Many researchers proposed and implemented different alternatives to <b>absolute</b> <b>encoder.</b> One technique is using an image rotary encoder. Current trends in digital image processing techniques have been applied widely into various applications. Some of the applications emerge as a sensing device with the assist of digital image processing techniques. Therefore, the research objective is to develop an image rotary encoder based on image texture before converting it into speed and motion data. The image texture is captured from a specially-designed texture of rotating disc using a digital image sensor. The proposed image rotary encoder is based on pixel changes by motion of rotating disc. The captured images are then converted into motion data by an image processing algorithm. The output signal is a binary position code which is similar to the conventional absolute rotary encoder. Performance of the image rotary encoder is validated by comparing the speed and position with the conventional rotary encoder. Experimental results indicate that the speed and position measured by the developed image rotary encoder are directly proportional to those measured using the conventional rotary encoder. Experiments also confirmed that the developed image rotary encoder can be utilized as a feedback device to a DC motor PID position control. Therefore, the developed image rotary encoder successfully functions as an absolute rotary encoder...|$|E
