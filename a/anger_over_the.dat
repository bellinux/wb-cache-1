5|$|Due to its graphic violence, The Great Silence {{was awarded}} an 18 rating in Italy, {{limiting}} its domestic box office returns. The film performed {{better in the}} French and West German markets, {{largely due to the}} presence of Trintignant and Kinski. It has been reported that during a screening of the film in Sicily, one audience member fired a gun at the screen in <b>anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> film's ending.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, he sat {{as one of}} the senator-judges in the {{impeachment}} trial of his ally, President Joseph Estrada. He w{{as one of the}} eleven votes during the trial that successfully voted to block the opening of an envelope that was believed to contain proof of the corruption charges against Estrada. Public <b>anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Senate vote triggered the EDSA Revolution of 2001, leading to the ouster of Estrada and the accession of Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to the presidency.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's son, {{also called}} Gilbert de Clare, {{inherited}} the castle, but he died fighting {{at the battle}} of Bannockburn in 1314 while still quite young. The family's lands were initially placed {{under the control of the}} Crown, but before any decision could be taken on the inheritance, a revolt broke out in Glamorgan. <b>Anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> actions of the royal administrators caused Llywelyn Bren to rise up in January 1316, attacking Caerphilly Castle with a large force of men. The castle withstood the attack, but the town was destroyed and the rebellion spread. A royal army was despatched to deal with the situation, defeating Bren in a battle at Caerphilly Mountain and breaking the Welsh siege of the castle.|$|E
60|$|The {{battle was}} now growing fiercer and fiercer, and, <b>angered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> loss of Colonel Milam, the Texans forced {{their way to}} another house, which fronted the Military Plaza and was but {{a block from the}} Main Plaza.|$|R
25|$|The Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907 {{resolved}} unpleasant {{racial tensions}} with Japan. Tokyo was <b>angered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> segregation of Japanese children in San Francisco schools. The tensions were ended, but Japan also {{agreed not to}} allow unskilled workers to emigrate to the U.S.|$|R
50|$|Once again, {{the gang}} stages an {{elaborate}} musical show in Spanky's backyard. <b>Angered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> fact that Alfalfa has been {{chosen as the}} show's singing star, bully Tommy Butch sneaks backstage {{with the intention of}} sabotaging the production. But Butch is hoisted on his own petard, and the show goes on as scheduled.|$|R
5|$|Humphrey {{first entered}} presidential {{politics}} in 1952 {{running as a}} favorite son candidate in Minnesota. In 1960, he mounted a full-scale run, winning primaries in South Dakota and Washington D.C., but ultimately lost the Democratic nomination to future President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, Humphrey was tapped as the running mate of President Lyndon Johnson, {{who went on to}} win in a landslide victory over Republican Barry Goldwater. As Vice President, Humphrey oversaw turbulent times in America, including race riots and growing frustration and <b>anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> large number of casualties in the Vietnam War. President Johnson's popularity had plummeted as the election grew closer.|$|E
5|$|In early 1859, {{abolitionist}} Republican U.S. Senator William H. Seward sold Tubman a {{small piece}} of land on the outskirts of Auburn, New York, for US$1,200. The city was a hotbed of antislavery activism, and Tubman seized the opportunity to deliver her parents from the harsh Canadian winters. Returning to the U.S. meant that escaped slaves were at risk of being returned to the south under the Fugitive Slave Law, and Tubman's siblings expressed reservations. Catherine Clinton suggests that <b>anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> 1857 Dred Scott decision may have prompted Tubman to return to the U.S. Her land in Auburn became a haven for Tubman's family and friends. For years, she took in relatives and boarders, offering a safe place for black Americans seeking a better life in the north.|$|E
5|$|On December 29, 1876, {{a bridge}} over Ohio's Ashtabula River collapsed. The bridge {{had been built}} from metal cast at one of Stone's mills, and was {{carrying}} a train {{owned and operated by}} Stone's Lake Shore and Michigan Railway. Ninety-two people died; it was the worst rail disaster in American history up to that point. Blame fell heavily on Stone, who departed for Europe to recuperate and left Hay in charge of his businesses. The summer of 1877 was marked by labor disputes; a strike over wage cuts on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad soon spread to the Lake Shore, much to Hay's outrage. He blamed foreign agitators for the dispute, and vented his <b>anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> strike in his only novel, The Bread-Winners (1883).|$|E
50|$|Phil Rizzuto, <b>angered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{refusal of}} {{television}} station WPIX {{to give him}} a day off to attend his former teammate's funeral, abruptly resigned from his play-by-play announcing job with the station on August 19. He would return to call a partial schedule for the station in 1996 before retiring for good.|$|R
25|$|Upon the {{publishing}} of the article, religious seminary {{students in the}} city of Qom, <b>angered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> insult to Khomeini, clashed with police. According to the government, two were killed in the clash; according to the opposition, seventy were killed and over five hundred were injured. However, the casualty figures are different in different sources.|$|R
50|$|<b>Angered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{dismissal}} of her suit against Karen, Elizabeth decided {{the only way}} to get revenge is to hold Karen at gunpoint and have her kill herself the same way Thomas died. However, when Sam realizes what his mother is up to, he races over to Karen's to save her. After a tussle between Elizabeth, Karen and Sam, someone is shot.|$|R
5|$|With {{the failure}} of the Battle of Moscow, all German plans for a quick defeat of the Soviet Union had to be revised. The Soviet counteroffensives in December 1941 caused heavy {{casualties}} on both sides, but ultimately eliminated the German threat to Moscow. Attempting to explain matters, Hitler issued Directive N. 39, which cited the early onset of winter and the severe cold for the German failure, whereas the main reason was the German military unpreparedness for such a giant enterprise. On 22 June 1941, the Wehrmacht as a whole had 209 divisions at its disposal, 163 of which were offensively capable. On 31 March 1942, less than one year after the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Wehrmacht was reduced to fielding 58 offensively capable divisions. The Red Army's tenacity and ability to effectively counter-attack took the Germans as much by surprise as their own initial attack had the Soviets. Spurred on by the successful defense and in an effort to imitate the Germans, Stalin wanted to begin his own blitzkrieg campaign, not just against the German forces around Moscow, but against their armies in the north and south. <b>Anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> failed German offensives caused Hitler to relieve Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch of command and in his place, Hitler assumed personal control of the German Army on 19 December 1941.|$|E
25|$|Russian President Vladimir Putin {{has sought}} to harness and direct Muslim <b>anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Charlie Hebdo {{cartoons}} against the West. Putin {{is believed to have}} backed protests by Muslims in Russia against Charlie Hebdo and the West.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, Russian {{interest}} in the area increased greatly, sparked by nominal concern over British designs on Central Asia; by <b>anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> situation of Russian citizens held as slaves; and {{by the desire to}} control the trade in the region and to establish a secure source of cotton for Russia. When the United States Civil War prevented cotton delivery from Russia's primary supplier, the southern United States, Central Asian cotton assumed much greater importance for Russia.|$|E
5000|$|An {{attack by}} the FLN in 1955 during the war of Independence left around 123 civilians dead, mainly French and those {{suspected}} of collaboration. <b>Angered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> massacre of civilians, including women, seniors, and babies, the French escalated their offensive against the FLN. Reprisals by French forces may have killed between 1,200 (according to French sources,) and 12,000 (according to the FLN.) ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{an op-ed}} that {{appeared}} in the Washington Times in August 2012, Berman championed the Employee Rights Act, which, he noted, “extends guarantees to union members in the private sector to decide whether their dues money is spent for political purposes, otherwise known as 'paycheck protection.'” He also noted that union leaders had “partially boycotted the Democratic National Convention,” <b>angered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> decision to hold it in North Carolina, “a right-to-work state that is proudly the least unionized in the country.” ...|$|R
50|$|Martha Berry Mitchell, {{another of}} the married daughters of the late Major Berry, claimed the slave girl Lucy Ann Berry as a {{domestic}} servant. <b>Angered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> girl's lack of skills with laundry, Mitchell got into a physical confrontation with her, which Lucy Ann resisted. Martha and her husband David D. Mitchell decided to sell the young slave downriver. (Mitchell was the US regional Superintendent for Indian Affairs.) Before being shipped away, Lucy Ann escaped {{to the house of}} a friend of her mother.|$|R
25|$|Up to {{two million}} people may have visited Tiananmen Square on April 4. All levels of society, from the poorest peasants to {{high-ranking}} PLA officers {{and the children of}} high-ranking cadres, were represented in the activities. Those who participated were motivated by a mixture of <b>anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> treatment of Zhou, revolt against the Cultural Revolution and apprehension for China's future. The event did not appear to have coordinated leadership but rather seemed to be a reflection of public sentiment.|$|E
25|$|The second coroner's inquest {{was held}} from 1 April 2014 to 26 April 2016. It {{ruled that the}} {{supporters}} were unlawfully killed due to grossly negligent failures by police and ambulance services to fulfil their duty of care to the supporters. The inquest {{also found that the}} design of the stadium contributed to the crush, and that supporters were not to blame for the dangerous conditions. Public <b>anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> actions of his force during the second inquest led the SYP chief constable David Crompton to be suspended following the verdict.|$|E
25|$|Stalin, who {{had earlier}} {{directed}} several population transfers in the Soviet Union, strongly supported the expulsions, which worked to the Soviet Union's advantage in several ways. The satellite states would now {{feel the need}} to be protected by the Soviets from German <b>anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> expulsions. The assets left by expellees in Poland and Czechoslovakia were successfully used to reward cooperation with the new governments, and support for the Communists was especially strong in areas that had seen significant expulsions. Settlers in these territories welcomed the opportunities presented by their fertile soils and vacated homes and enterprises, increasing their loyalty.|$|E

5000|$|Like {{children}} {{with their new}} Christmas toys, members of the City Council yesterday were excited and delighted over selecting locations for their private offices in the new City Hall — all but Councilman Hughes, who became so <b>angered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> method used that he called Councilman A. Martin a [...] "meddler" [...] for the latter's effort to parcel out the rooms. In turn, Councilman Martin called Councilman Hughes a [...] "liar." [...] [...] [...] [...] "Don't you call me a liar or I'll knock your head off," [...] said Councilman Hughes to Councilman Martin." ...|$|R
50|$|Gruber {{was traded}} to the California Angels for Luis Sojo in December 1992. Soon after his arrival, Gruber {{announced}} that he had bulging discs in his neck. Just over two months after the trade, Gruber had shoulder surgery to repair a rotator cuff tear. Gruber was expected to be sidelined for at least eight weeks. Angels manager Buck Rodgers was <b>angered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> news of Gruber's surgery; he felt that the Blue Jays must have known about the extent of Gruber's injury before they traded him. Rodgers said that Rene Gonzales would be the team's third baseman that year.|$|R
25|$|Roosevelt {{responded to}} public <b>anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> abuses {{in the food}} packing {{industry}} by pushing Congress to pass the Meat Inspection Act of 1906 and the Pure Food and Drug Act. Though conservatives initially opposed the bill, Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, published in 1906, helped galvanize support for reform. The Meat Inspection Act of 1906 banned misleading labels and preservatives that contained harmful chemicals. The Pure Food and Drug Act banned food and drugs that were impure or falsely labeled from being made, sold, and shipped. Roosevelt also served as honorary president of the American School Hygiene Association from 1907 to 1908, and in 1909 he convened the first White House Conference on the Care of Dependent Children.|$|E
25|$|The battle, which {{marked the}} first use of torpedoes by the Brazilian military, {{signaled}} {{the end of the}} revolution in Brazil. The members of the revolutionary government based in Desterro, in the island of Santa Catarina, fled to the continent; loyalist Colonel Antônio Moreira César would later regain control of the city. Refloated in June 1894 by government forces, Aquidabã was quickly renamed to first Dezesseis de Abril (English: 16 April), then Vinte e Quatro de Maio (English: 24 May) due to <b>anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ship rebelling twice in four years. Partially repaired, the ship was brought to Stettin, Germany, and Elswick, England for a full repair and refitting. The work lasted from 1897 to 1898, and included the installation of two heavy fighting masts.|$|E
25|$|The sixth {{anniversary of}} Hariri's assassination, on 14 February 2011 {{was met with}} renewed enthusiasm by {{supporters}} of the March 14 coalition. This was especially fueled by the protesters' <b>anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> resignation of all ten ministers aligned with the opposing March 8 coalition due to then-prime minister Saad Hariri, Rafik Hariri's son, refusal of Hezbollah's demand he reject the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. A rally was also organized to call for Hezbollah's disarmament {{on the day of}} March 13 in Beirut's Martyrs' Square. No significant disruptions took place, but it was reported by several TV stations that some protesters had their signs demanding Hezbollah's disarmament confiscated. Reuters approximated that tens of thousands of supporters of Saad Hariri and his allies rallied against Hezbollah's weapons.|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{expansion of}} French urban areas {{to the detriment}} of rural and natural areas should logically increase the need of parks on behalf of city-dwellers.

50|$|In September 2011 Air Miles {{announced}} that it would be rebranding to Avios and that taxes and charges would then be chargeable, quoting £497 for a return flight to Sydney; many previous users expressed regret and <b>anger</b> <b>over</b> this. <b>The</b> Airmiles scheme was combined with BA Miles and ended at midnight 14 November.|$|R
25|$|Up to {{two million}} people may have visited Tiananmen Square on 4 April. First-hand {{observations}} of the events in Tiananmen Square on 4 April report that all levels of society, from the poorest peasants to high-ranking PLA officers {{and the children of}} high-ranking cadres, were represented in the activities. Those who participated were motivated by a mixture of <b>anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> treatment of Zhou, revolt against Mao and his policies, apprehension for China's future, and defiance of those who would seek to punish the public for commemorating Zhou's memory. There is nothing to suggest that events were coordinated from any position of leadership: it was a spontaneous demonstration reflecting widespread public sentiment. Deng Xiaoping was notably absent, and he instructed his children to avoid being seen at the square.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, Bluenose faced Columbia, another American yacht newly {{designed}} and constructed {{to defeat the}} Canadian schooner. The International Fishermen's Trophy race was held off Halifax in 1923 and new rules {{were put in place}} preventing ships from passing marker buoys to landward. During the first race, the two schooners dueled inshore, the rigging of the vessels coming together. However, Bluenose won the first race. During the second race, Bluenose broke the new rule and was declared to have lost the race. Angus Walters protested the decision and demanded that no vessel be declared winner. The judging committee rejected his protest, which led Walters to remove Bluenose from the competition. The committee declared the competition a tie, and the two vessels shared the prize money and the title. The <b>anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> events led to an eight-year hiatus in the race.|$|E
25|$|Northern <b>anger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{assassination}} of Lincoln and the immense human {{cost of the}} war led to demands for punitive policies. Vice President Andrew Johnson had taken a hard line and spoke of hanging rebel Confederates, but when he succeeded Lincoln as President, Johnson took a much softer position, pardoning many Confederate leaders and former Confederates. Jefferson Davis was held in prison for two years, but other Confederate leaders were not. There were no treason trials. Only one person—Captain Henry Wirz, the commandant of the prison camp in Andersonville, Georgia—was executed for war crimes. Andrew Johnson's conservative view of Reconstruction did not include blacks or former slaves involvement in government and he refused to heed Northern concerns when southern state legislatures implemented Black Codes that set {{the status of the}} freedmen much lower than that of citizens.|$|E
5000|$|Zappa phoned Paul McCartney, seeking {{permission}} for the parody. McCartney {{told him that}} it was an issue for business managers, but Zappa responded that the artists themselves were supposed to tell their business managers what to do. Nevertheless, Capitol objected, and the album's release was delayed for five months. Verve decided to package the album with inverted cover artwork, placing the parody cover as interior artwork (and the intended interior artwork as the main sleeve) out of fear of legal action. Zappa was <b>angered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> decision; Schenkel felt that the Sgt. Pepper parody [...] "was a stronger image" [...] than the final released cover.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the plans}} for Tracy and Jenna, Jack tells Liz—the head writer for TGS—to begin searching for a new cast member to help lessen this elitist image. Liz {{recruits}} TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) to help in her search, planning trips to comedy clubs to find new talent. Both agree {{to try to keep}} the process secret from the cast and crew for fear that they would be <b>angered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> idea of a new actor joining the cast. Liz and Pete give awkward answers trying to explain why they are going places together and ultimately tell the TGS writing staff. They also inadvertently tell Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) who, angered by the news, quits the show.|$|R
50|$|Both {{teams were}} {{upset about the}} outcome of the game. Allegheny was unable to collect on their bets, while Pittsburgh was <b>angered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Chicago players being {{imported}} into the contest. Pittsburgh called Heffelfinger a paid professional and insisted he had been paid $500 to play in the game. On top of that, the team charged that all three Chicago men had received twice their travel expenses, making them paid professionals. Meanwhile, Allegheny accused Pittsburgh of hiring Simon Martin, who was promised a job at the club for his participation. Both teams threatened to take their complaints to the Amateur Athletic Association, but later backed down after realizing that each team's own activities would be closely scrutinized.|$|R
