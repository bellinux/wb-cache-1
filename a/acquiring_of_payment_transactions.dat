The monetary presentation is a tool for assessing the impact <b>of</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> <b>transactions</b> involving non-bank residents on monetary developments. The paper explains in detail the principle underlying this approach, i. e. {{the link between the}} external counterpart of money, as reflected in the balance sheet of the banking sector, and the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> From a statistical perspective, it is shown that the monetary presentation of the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments,</b> which is based on international statistical standards, may be applied in any country or currency union. With regard to euro area statistics, the paper elaborates on the practical implementation of the monetary presentation, while also describing a few approximations and remaining statistical challenges.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of a survey conducted in fall 2005 on the <b>payment</b> habits <b>of</b> Austrian households, comparing its findings with those of similar surveys carried out in 1996 and 2000. The focus is to analyze changes in the use <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> means over time and, on this basis, to assess future trends. As the analysis in the 2005 survey shows, cash continues to dominate the structure <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> <b>transactions,</b> remaining by far the most important means <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> Cash payments account for 86 % <b>of</b> all direct <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> by Austrian households and for 70 % <b>of</b> the total <b>payment</b> value. Compared with the previous surveys, however, the share of cash has contracted noticeably whereas the share <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> at point-of-sale (POS) terminals (via debit card payments) has more than doubled {{in the last five years}} to 11. 5 %. Although credit card payments have posted a slight increase, their share in the total volume still remains very low (1. 3 %). Overall, the results indicate the continuation of cash-card substitution. From a central banking perspective, assessing future trends in cash demand is a key monetary policy issue. The findings of this study suggest that Austrian households’ payment habits will not change abruptly, therefore, any impact on monetary policy can be expected to remain very limited. usage <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> means, demand for money, monetary policy. ...|$|R
