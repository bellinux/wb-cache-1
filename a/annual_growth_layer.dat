40|$|The {{suitability}} of mountain birch {{as a subject}} for tree ring analysis was explored in a study near Jankajarvi based on {{a small number of}} samples and published monthly summaries of climatic data. Examination of the distribution of annual wood formation along the stem, in the form of <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>layer</b> profiles, gave inconclusive results, but significant correlations were obtained between climatic variables and ring indices derived from horizontal ring-width sequences. Simple correlations were significant only with measures of temperature, of which maximum temperature wss the most important. Highest correlations were with average maximum temperature of June and July of the year of ring formation and August of the previous year. Discussion of the results in relation to independent observations of birch growth in general, to defoliation and to the sub-arctic environment leads to the general conclusion that ring analysis could make a significant contribution to the study of birch - climate - defoliaton interactions, but relationships with climate and with defoliation require to be examined in more detail than in the present study...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of age {{is an important step}} in defining the life history traits of individuals and populations. Age {{determination of}} odontocetes is mainly based on counting <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>layer</b> groups in the teeth. However, this useful method is always invasive, requiring the cutting of at least one tooth, and sometimes the results are difficult to interpret. Based on the concept that bone matrix is constantly deposited throughout life, we analysed the bone mineral density of the arm and forearm of a series of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus, Montagu 1821) stranded along the Italian coast of the Adriatic Sea or maintained in confined waters. The bone mineral density values we obtained were evaluated as possible age predictors of the Mediterranean population of this species, considering age as determined by counting growth layer groups in sections of the teeth and the total body length of the animal as references. Comparisons between left and right flipper showed no difference. Our results show that bone mineral density values of the thoracic limb are indeed reliable age predictors in Tursiops truncatus. Further investigations in additional odontocete species are necessary to provide strong evidence of the reliability of bone mineral density as an indicator of growth and chronological wear and tear in toothed-whales...|$|E
40|$|Teeth {{were taken}} from 120 {{bottlenose}} dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, which had stranded on the mid-Atlantic coast of the United States. The number of <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>layer</b> groups (GLGs) for each animal was used to construct a growth curve. The growth rate of coastal North Atlantic Ocean Tursiops is similar to other cetaceans in having a high initial rate of growth, with no dif-ferences in growth between females and males. In females, the first dentinal GLG is thickest and is followed by GLGs which become progressively nar-rower. In males, the second GLG is thicker than the first; GLGs beyond number two become progressively smaller but at a slower rate than in fe-males. In males and females, the translucent layer makes up proportionally larger parts of the GLG as the animal ages, but in males the percent trans-. lucent layer remains constant at about 50 % while in females it continues to increase up to about 70 % of the GLG. These two factors, GLGs width and translucent layer width, indicate that the sex and age of the animal influence the deposition of GLGs. Incremental layers are also present, averaging 12 per GLG, and seem similar to incremental layers described in other marine mammals. A plot {{of the relationship of}} percent growth of the last GLG to time of death suggests that the deposition of GLGs is relatively constant, at least {{during the first half of}} the year, and that North Atlantic Ocean Tursiops give birth in the fall as well as in the spring...|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to develop {{high-resolution}} sea surface temperature (SST) proxies for mid-latitude regions, two massive reef-building coral species, Alveopora and Favia, were collected from Jeju and Tsushima Islands, respectively. Their skeletons were subsequently analyzed for <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> banding, Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios. Hermatypic corals are thinly distributed {{in the waters of}} Jeju Island, where Alveopora japonica was the only dominant coral species. A higher diversity of hermatypic corals were observed in the waters of Tsushima Island, where Favia sp. was the most common coral species and even forming an about 6 -m-high reef structure. Both Alveopora and Favia showed <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>layers</b> consisting of couplets of high- and low-density bands. Sr/Ca ratio of both species and Mg/Ca ratio of Alveopora also showed seasonal variation, likely reflecting SST variation. These results suggest the possibility that Alveopora and Favia species can be used as potential SST proxies. However, this study also highlights the potential growth disturbance of middle latitude corals due to high rainfall during monsoon and low SST during winter.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the pursued {{research}} is to increase knowledge {{of the effects of}} knots in structural timber so that characteristics of weaker timber may be determined and applied to improve current grading techniques. In the process, a three-dimensional fiber paradigm was established, which describes variations of local principle material axes in timber containing knots. The adaptability of the paradigm allows practically any softwood knot and its effect on surrounding wood material to be modeled with an accuracy that is limited only by input data. In the description of the fiber paradigm, considerations are given to Shigo’s knot formation theory, which predicts two separate patterns of fiber direction within annual growth layers related to live knots. In order to determine the possibility to practically and non-destructively predict local material directions in structural timber with the three-dimensional fiber paradigm, variations of knot and knot bump geometry and related fiber disturbance of eleven knots from two trees of Nordic Spruce (Picea Abies) grown in Southern Sweden were analyzed. Results showed that the paradigm could be calibrated to describe measured projected fiber orientations in the radial and tangential planes from two visual knot parameters with a coefficient of correlation R 2 = 0. 88. Spiral grain was considered in the investigation, and was shown to correspond well to results from previous research on Nordic Spruce. When modeling the mechanical behavior of timber containing knots, variation of material properties within the stem wood, and the effect of altering fiber patterns within a single <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>layer</b> were modeled with the principles of homogenization and assumed constant material properties of the earlywood, transientwood, and latewood. Flatwise bending stiffness along a timber beam was predicted numerically with the model and compared to measured values. The results indicated that the proposed model of the effect of knots on sawn timber, and the assumed properties of earlywood, transientwood, and latewood in relation to variations of annual ring thickness throughout the beam account for the measured variations of stiffness. The results also suggest that variation of annual ring thickness may cause larger variations in stiffness than the distribution and properties of knots along the beam. The derived and verified model of knot effects on sawn timber was applied to predict the severity of stress states for various knot positions in tensile loaded timber members. From these results a definition of a critical knot was derived. The applicability of the critical knot definition was analyzed in relation to actual tensile load carrying capacities experimentally determined for structural timber. Based on these results it is concluded that the derived critical knot definition offers an efficient method to sort out particularly weak members (tensile capacity less than 20 MPa) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of paleoclimate series from speleothems commonly involves {{large amounts of}} geochemical analyses performed from tiny samples. So the task requires of analytical techniques capable of achieving a good balance between: 1) the volume of material analysed (and hence the spatial scale of analysis), 2) the precision and accuracy of the results, and 3) the speed and cost of the analytical process. Unfortunately, when working with speleothem trace elements, that balance is not always conveniently reached. This work presents {{an evaluation of the}} performance of LIBS as analyser to construct accurate trace element time-series based in speleothems. For this a series of tests performed on polished sections of a stalagmite were made. The chosen stalagmite, retrieved from Kaite Cave (Northern Spain), consists of calcite and shows a welldefined micrometric annual lamination. The steps followed to perform the evaluation refer to two aspects: adaptation of the appropriate sample strategy for the analysis and characterization of precision of the technique in terms of repeatability under controlled and stable working conditions (fixed plasma temperature and laser pulse length). The selected elemental ratios for the study were Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca, which are among the most frequently used ones for palehydrological/paleoclimate studies. To choose the adequate sampling method a series of measurements were made on the polished section of the stalagmite in order to check the homogeneity of the sample in terms of uniformity of results along a single (<b>annual)</b> <b>growth</b> <b>layer.</b> The test was based in twelve analyses that revealed a remarkably lateral continuity in both Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca intensity ratios. After the measurements, the laser induced damage was determined by optical microscopy to assess both the spatial distribution of the spots along the growth layer and their morphology and diameter. The spot area shows an ellipsoidal shape crater around 300 μm of average diameter, lower than the thickness of the growth layer (average 450 μm wide). The analytical repeatability was assessed by measuring Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca intensity ratios of 140 single points along two transects separated 3 mm, parallel to the growth axis of the stalagmite, showing a good match between both transect. The average pulse length was 4 ns and the stability of the signal was assessed from repetitive measurements on the same spot area (20 laser shots at each sample position). The plasma temperature was monitored by the ratio of emission intensities of two lines of calcium: Ca (I) at 430. 77 nm and Ca (II) at 318. 13 nm (ICa 430. 77 /ICa 318. 13), showing that the plasma temperature is kept nearly constant throughout the experiment LIBS, minimizing the effect matrix and providing more accurate results. Results support LIBS as a suitable system for trace elements analysis on speleothems. Main advantages of the technique are: relatively low operational costs and less maintenance and man-power compared to other techniques.

40|$|Tree {{demography}} was analysed {{by applying}} dendrochronological techniques and matrix modelling on a static data set of Juniperus procera populations of Ethiopian dry highland forests. Six {{permanent sample plots}} were established for an inventory of diameters and 11 stem discs were collected for dendrochronological analysis. J. procera was proved to form concentric <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>layers</b> in response to seasonal changes in precipitation. Uncertainty analysis for the matrix model revealed its robustness to variations in parameter estimates. The major outcome was that the population growth rate is very sensitive to changes in growth or survival of trees between 10 and 40 cm DBH. For forest management this implies that these intermediate sized individuals should be protected and less used for harvest. This study documents that interesting results can be achieved using a relatively simple approach that can easily be adopted for other areas or with other species. However, the matrix modelling requires more precise knowledge about the trees¿ fecundity and survival (especially for the smaller individuals) and more consistent inventories. For tree-ring analysis {{it can be concluded}} that J. procera from Ethiopia has potential to investigate the relationship between tree growth and precipitation with a high temporal resolutio...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{nuclear tests}} in the early 1960 s {{introduced}} large amounts of radiocarbon into the atmosphere, which resulted in an increase of tropospheric ¹⁴CO₂ concentration by nearly 100 % during the years 1964 - 1965. The bomb-produced ¹⁴C was then gradually incorporated within the global carbon cycle. The history of ¹⁴C concentration in the troposphere is preserved within <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>layers</b> of trees and can be reconstructed for those areas where direct measurements of 14 C in the atmosphere were not performed. The paper presents results of ¹⁴C activity measurements in tree rings of tropical and subtropical species from Brazil, for the period 1945 - 1997. We investigated two species (Araucaria angustifolia and Parkia sp.) growing at three sites covering the latitudinal band between 7 °S and 24 °S. The {{results indicate that the}} maximum ¹⁴C activity in the Southern Hemisphere occurred in 1965, with the Δ¹⁴C values reaching around 700 %. Significant differences in Δ¹⁴C were recorded among the studied sites for the period of maximal ¹⁴C levels in the atmosphere, with the highest level observed at the tropical site and lowest in the subtropical zone. This reflects the dynamics of interhemispheric transport of ¹⁴C during the years of high spatial and temporal gradients of this isotope in the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{two methods}} allowing {{the prediction of}} age at maturation from the width of <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>layers</b> in scales (or otoliths) in a case study on Norwegian spring-spawning herring. For this stock, scale measurements have been collected routinely for may decades. We compare the performance in classifying age at maturation(at 3, 4, [...] . 9 years) between conventional discriminant analysis (DA) and the new methodology of artificial neural networks trained by backpropagation (NN) against a 'control' comprising historical estimates of age at maturation obtained by visual examination of scales. Both methods show encouraging, and about equally high classification success. The marginal differences in performance are in favour of DA, if the proportion of correctly classified cases is used as criterion (DA 68. 0 %, NN 66. 6. %), but in favor of NN if other criteria are used including the prediction errors (error > 1 year: DA 5. 2 %, NN 2. 9 %) and the average degree of under- or overestimation (DA: underestimation 1. 1 % of mean; NN: overestimation 0. 2 % of mean). We provide evidence that both methods approach the a priori limit to maximal classification success, caused by overlapping combinations of predictor variables between maturation groups. These methods will allow studies on age at maturation in this important fish stock over a very long time-span including periods well before, during, and after its collapse to commercial extinction. Similar techniques might well be applicable to any other fish stock with long-term data on scale or otolith <b>growth</b> <b>layers</b> available...|$|R
40|$|With near-complete {{replacement}} of Arctic multi-year ice (MYI) by first-year ice (FYI) predicted to occur within this century, it remains uncertain how {{the loss of}} MYI will impact the abundance and distribution of sea ice associated algae. In this study we compare the chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations and physical properties of MYI and FYI from the Lincoln Sea during 3 spring seasons (2010 - 2012). Cores were analysed for texture, salinity, and chl a. We identified <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>layers</b> for 7 of 11 MYI cores and found {{no significant differences in}} chl a concentration between the bottom first-year-ice portions of MYI, upper old-ice portions of MYI, and FYI cores. Overall, the maximum chl a concentrations were observed at the bottom of young FYI. However, {{there were no significant differences}} in chl a concentrations between MYI and FYI. This suggests little or no change in algal biomass with a shift from MYI to FYI and that the spatial extent and regional variability of refrozen leads and younger FYI will likely be key factors governing future changes in Arctic sea ice algal biomass. Bottom-integrated chl a concentrations showed negative logistic relationships with snow depth and bulk (snow plus ice) integrated extinction coefficients; indicating a strong influence of snow cover in controlling bottom ice algal biomass. The maximum bottom MYI chl a concentration was observed in a hummock, representing the thickest ice with lowest snow depth of this study. Hence, in this and other studies MYI chl a biomass may be under-estimated due to an under-representation of thick MYI (e. g., hummocks), which typically have a relatively thin snowpack allowing for increased light transmission. Therefore, we suggest the on-going loss of MYI in the Arctic Ocean may have a larger impact on ice-associated production than generally assumed...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the {{three-dimensional}} orthogonal directions of wood material at any position within a tree {{is necessary for}} the understanding of strength reducing effects of knots and essential for the continuation of research in areas which relate small clear wood specimen behavior to the behavior of full size structural timber. A complete three-dimensional paradigm describing the geometry of knots and related fiber distortion, initially derived to predict the strength-reducing behavior of knots in structural timber of Norway Spruce with the finite element method, is presented in this article. Besides strength prediction analyses, it is believed that the paradigm may be useful in other areas of research on structural timber that are effected by fiber orientation, such as drying and form change of structural timber. The paradigm generates fiber orientation in any position within a log or lumber from assumed fiber patterns in planes parallel to the longitudinal direction of the original tree. Fiber patterns in the radial and tangential directions are derived from physical restraints related to fiber production within the annual increase surfaces of the tree and from theories of knot formation. The adaptability of the paradigm allows practically any softwood knot to be modeled with an accuracy that is limited only by input-data. The knot-axis may be non-linear, and the knot cross-section oval with its vertical and horizontal axis increasing from the pith of the stem at chosen rates. Spiral grain may also be included in the paradigm and vary with the <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>layers.</b> Investigations presented in this article showed that generated fiber orientations for Picea abies complied well with measured fiber distortions, and that the general trends of fiber orientation, explained by the applied knot formation theory, is reflected in the measured specimens...|$|R

The monitoring {{is based on}} histometrical analysis of stem tissues of adult trees including cambial zone, xylem (wood) and phloem. Samples (micro cores) for analyses were taken from trees using a Trephor tool at weekly intervals during the growing seasons. Micro cores were embedded in paraffin in order to cut cross-sections and make permanent slides for observations under the light microscope. We always measured the width or counted the number of cells in the cambium, forming xylem and forming phloem increments. The measurements or counting were performed along three radial files of xylem and phloem growth rings and the cambial zone. We recorded the phases of xylem formation: PC – post-cambial extension growth, SW – deposition of secondary wall and lignification, MT – mature cells. In phloem we separately recorded the formation of early and late phloem. Research on beech was conducted in 2006 and from 2008 until 2014, and on spruce from 2009 until 2014.

The present study aims to clarify secondary growth via successive cambia in the mangrove species Avicennia marina on a macroscopic level, addressing {{the formation of the}} <b>growth</b> <b>layer</b> network as a whole. In addition, previously suggested effects of salinity on <b>growth</b> <b>layer</b> formation were reconsidered. Methods: A 1 -year cambial marking experiment was performed on 80 trees from eight sites in two mangrove forests in Kenya. Environmental (soil water salinity and nutrients, soil texture, inundation frequency) and tree characteristics (diameter, height, leaf area index) were recorded for each site. Both groups of variables were analysed in relation to <b>annual</b> number of <b>growth</b> <b>layers,</b> <b>annual</b> radial increment and average <b>growth</b> <b>layer</b> width of stem discs. Key Results: Between trees of the same site, the number of <b>growth</b> <b>layers</b> formed during the 1 -year study period varied from only part of a <b>growth</b> <b>layer</b> up to four <b>growth</b> <b>layers,</b> and was highly correlated to the corresponding radial increment (0 - 5 mm year- 1), even along the different sides of asymmetric stem discs. The radial increment was unrelated to salinity, but the <b>growth</b> <b>layer</b> width decreased with increasing salinity and decreasing tree height. Conclusions: A patchy growth mechanism was proposed, with an optimal growth at distinct moments in time at different positions around the stem circumference. This strategy creates the opportunity to form several <b>growth</b> <b>layers</b> simultaneously, as observed in 14 % of the studied trees, which may optimize tree growth under favourable conditions.

Profiles of stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (δ 15 N) and carbon (δ 13 C) from the teeth of northern elephant seals Mirounga angustirostris, aged between 1 and 11 yr, were described from stranded individuals in San Benito and Magdalena Islands, Mexico, between 2000 and 2009. δ 13 C and δ 15 N values differed with age in each sex indicating shifts in feeding habits throughout life, {{as well as in}} their physiological condition. Although steady δ 13 C values within each individual suggest fidelity to feeding grounds, differences in δ 13 C values between males and females were likely a reflection of sexual segregation on the feeding areas, which begins during the juvenile stage. Mean δ 15 N values of males (18. 3 ‰) and females (18. 2 ‰) would suggest that both groups feed at a similar trophic level; however a combination of differences in benthic versus pelagic and longitudinal foraging habitats would be masking real sex differences in trophic level, estimated for the species at 4. 6. δ 15 N and δ 13 C values varied markedly between individuals of the same sex, suggesting the potential existence of diverse feeding strategies leading to a resource partitioning in this species.

However, the periodic nature of the rings was seriously affected by slow growth rates, allowing accurate age determination only in trees with radial growth rates above 0. 5 mm year(- 1). The onset of the formation of the low vessel density wood coincided with the onset of the long rainy season (April-May) and continues {{until the end of the}} short rainy season (November). The high vessel density wood is formed during the dry season (December-March). Age determination of the largest trees collected in the two studied forests revealed the relatively young age of these trees (+/- 100 years). Conclusions This study reports, for the first time, the presence of <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> rings in the mangrove R. mucronata, which offers further potential for dendrochronological and silvicultural applications...|$|R

The teeth samples were collected from dolphins landed as by-catch in the gillnets. The <b>growth</b> <b>layers</b> offer reliable information on the age of dolphins.
