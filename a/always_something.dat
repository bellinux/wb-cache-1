500|$|Staffing {{schedules}} led to {{the band}} having a surplus of engineers at one point, and as a result, they split recording between Elsinore and the Edge's home studio to increase productivity. Engineer Robbie Adams said the approach raised morale and activity levels: [...] "There was <b>always</b> <b>something</b> different to listen to, <b>always</b> <b>something</b> exciting happening." [...] To record all of the band's material and test different arrangements, the engineers utilised a technique they called [...] "fatting", which allowed them to achieve more than 48tracks of audio by using a 24-track analogue recording, a DAT machine, and a synchroniser. The focus on capturing the band's material and encouraging the best performances meant that little {{attention was paid to}} combating audio spill. In issue 14 of U2's fan magazine Propaganda, Lanois said that he believed some of the in-progress songs would become worldwide hits, despite lyrics and vocal takes being unfinished.|$|E
500|$|After Wiggins died, several {{well-known}} baseball figures {{commented on}} his death.

He confounds everybody because of that, and people ascribe him meaning.

500|$|In 1960 Betjeman was {{appointed}} a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE), which was followed in 1968 with his election as a Companion of Literature. In 1969 he was knighted and, in 1972, he succeeded Cecil Day-Lewis as Britain's Poet Laureate. In the later {{years of his}} life, Betjeman suffered from Parkinson's disease, and he died in May 1984. His obituarist in The Times thought him [...] "a true original", and considered that he was [...] "whimsical, imprudent, shrewd, humorous, disarming, <b>always</b> <b>something</b> of an enfant terrible. The poet Philip Larkin wrote that Betjeman [...] "was not only the best loved poet, {{but one of the}} best loved men of our time", while his biographer, the academic John Clarke, described him as a [...] "unique figure in twentieth-century English poetry, enjoying a degree of fame and success unequalled by any poet since Byron".|$|E
500|$|In 1893, Sibelius had {{expressed}} {{his belief in}} the necessity of poetic motivation in music {{in a letter to the}} poet , [...] "I believe that music alone, that is absolute music, can not satisfy.

[...] In a letter to Aino from August 1894, Sibelius claimed to be [...] "really a tone painter and poet" [...] in the mold of the symphonic poems of Liszt. In The Wood Nymph, Sibelius adheres closely to the narrative structure of Rydberg's poem, so much so that at the 1895 premiere, audience members were provided with copies of the source material, indicating the centrality of Rydberg's plot to the performance. Due to its programmatic qualities, musicologists commonly describe The Wood Nymph, although in one movement, as consisting of four informal sections or [...] "dramatic tableaux", each of which corresponds to one of the poem's four stanzas: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{bridge of}} [...] "Lamb of God" [...] paraphrases {{the chorus of}} [...] "Across the Universe" [...] (from 1970's Let It Be), whose lyric [...] "Nothing's gonna change my world" [...] {{inspired}} the song. Manson elaborated that: [...] "Mark David Chapman came along and proved him very wrong. That was <b>always</b> <b>something</b> growing up that was very sad and tragic to me". The song uses the assassinations of JFK and John Lennon to criticize the media's veneration of death, and for turning tragedy into televised spectacle. [...] "Burning Flag" [...] is a heavy-metal song reminiscent of American industrial metal band Ministry. The album ends with an interlocking group of songs: [...] "Valentine's Day", [...] "The Fall of Adam", [...] "King Kill 33°" [...] and [...] "Count to Six and Die (The Vacuum of Infinite Space Encompassing)", as each song abruptly ends and is instantaneously followed by the intro of the proceeding track.|$|E
500|$|The album's artwork {{was created}} by English street artist D*Face. Barker was a fan of his work, having bought many of his pieces at his {{galleries}} in the past. According to D*Face, the trio [...] "wanted the artwork to represent California, but with a subversive side to show that it's not always great and there's <b>always</b> <b>something</b> under the surface, in the underbelly." [...] The artist was particularly busy, and employed pre-existing but unfinished illustration for the album cover. He also offered two alternate pieces that were rejected, but later posted on NME website. Skiba and Barker were pleased, but Hoppus was not as immediately receptive, according to the artist. While he did not admit to being {{a fan of the}} group, D*Face was happy with the commission, commenting, [...] "To have a band with such a great legacy and talent like Blink ask to work with you is a great honour and privilege." ...|$|E
500|$|Nimoy {{was hired}} for three episodes, {{beginning}} with the season finale. Fringe co-creator Roberto Orci described Nimoy's character as [...] "a mix of Howard Hughes and Bill Gates", while Nimoy referred to Bell as a [...] "master of the universe" [...] who is [...] "brilliant, wealthy and very powerful". Nimoy's part of the final scene of the episode with Olivia was very brief. Nimoy described the scene as [...] "interesting, entertaining" [...] and [...] "that you'll {{want to see more}} of this relationship and what it's all about". Actress Anna Torv described the final scene as calm yet threatening, [...] "That's what's kind of cool about working on Fringe, is everything seems kind of calm and lovely, but there's <b>always</b> <b>something</b> going on underneath". While shooting, Nimoy commented that the character [...] "was a unique experience," [...] as he had not acted outside of the Spock character for a number of years. Nimoy has stated in multiple interviews that his Fringe role will be the last project in his acting career.|$|E

500|$|The {{chemistry}} between Pine and Quinto {{was well}} received by critics. Gleiberman felt {{that as the}} film progressed to the conclusion, Pine and Quinto emulated the same connection as Kirk and Spock. Tim Robey of The Telegraph echoed similar attitudes; [...] "The movie charts their relationship [...] in a nicely oblique way." [...] Robey resumed: [...] "It's the main event, dramatically speaking, but there's <b>always</b> <b>something</b> more thumpingly urgent to command their attention, whether it's a Vulcan distress signal or the continuing rampages of those pesky Romulans." [...] Burr opined that Abrams had an accurate {{understanding of the relationship}} between Kirk and Spock, and wrote, [...] "Pine makes a fine, brash boy Kirk, but Quinto's Spock is something special – an eerily calm figure freighted with a heavier sadness than Roddenberry's original. The two ground each other and point toward all the stories yet to come." [...] Similarly, The Guardian writer Peter Bradshaw expressed: [...] "The story of Kirk and Spock is brought thrillingly back to life by a new first generation: Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, who give inspired, utterly unselfconscious and lovable performances, with power, passion and some cracking comic timing." ...|$|E
500|$|UK {{magazines}} Computer and Video Games and its spin-off Mean Machines – in the latter's premiere issue – {{gave the}} game positive reviews.

Mean Machines [...] Matt Regan said it [...] "ranks {{as one of the}} greatest Sega Master System games ever!"; he compared the gameplay to the Mario series of video games and praised the game's depth, saying that [...] "there's <b>always</b> <b>something</b> new to discover, be it a key to a previously locked door or even a secret room!" [...] Julian Rignall praised the game's graphics and the huge world players can explore, which he says contributes to the game's addictiveness. He said that [...] "the combination of adventuring, shooting and platform action results in one of the best games of its type available on any console". Collectively, they praised the game overall presentation and graphics, saying that the sprites complement the background. While they additionally praised its playability for being [...] "accessible from the word go" [...] and longevity, they criticized its sound, saying that it [...] "could have been much better".|$|E
500|$|In {{her letters}} to her {{siblings}} in Tobolsk, Maria described her unease {{at the new}} restrictions on the family at Yekaterinburg.

A wooden fence was installed around the house, limiting their view of the street. [...] "Oh, how complicated everything is now," [...] she wrote on May 2, 1918. [...] "We lived so peacefully for eight months and now it's all started again." [...] Maria passed the time by attempting to befriend members of the Ipatiev House Guard. She showed them pictures from her photo albums and talked with them about their families and her own hopes for a new life in England if she was released. Alexander Strekotin, one of the guards, recalled in his memoirs that she [...] "was a girl who loved to have fun." [...] Another of the guards recalled Maria's buxom beauty with appreciation and said she didn't assume an air of grandeur. One former sentry recalled that Maria was often scolded by her mother in [...] "severe and angry whispers," [...] apparently for being too friendly with the guards at Yekaterinburg. Strekotin wrote that their conversations always began with one of the girls saying, [...] "We're so bored! In Tobolsk there was <b>always</b> <b>something</b> to do. I know!
