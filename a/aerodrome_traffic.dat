40|$|The {{proposed}} book contains in six separate chapters {{contributions to}} the variety of aspects of the interdisciplinary research and development work performed during the recent ten years towards the goal of replacing the conventional airport control tower by a new "Remote Tower" work environment (RTO). As a first step small, low-traffic airports are addressed with the expectation of increasing work efficiency and safety and reducing cost. This revolutionary human-system interface allows for remote <b>aerodrome</b> <b>traffic</b> control without the physical tower building {{and at the same}} time enables the establishment of Remote Airport Traffic Control Centers (RTC) where several airports will be controlled from a central location. Following a preface and an introduction into the subject the ca. 23 separate contributions are grouped into six chapters which cover the following topics: Fundamentals (<b>Aerodrome</b> <b>Traffic</b> Control, visual information / visual cues, aircraft detection/SSO-model), Human-in-the-Loop Simulations for Requirements and Design (work analysis, communication issues, RTO /RTC human-in-the-loop simulations, requirements from two-alternative decision experiments), RTO-Design and Engineering (videopanorama design and engineering, automation, movement detection), RTO-/RTC-Validation (operational issues, shadow-mode tests, data analysis and advanced methods), Alternative Approaches and Perspectives (US-FAA Approach, future perspectives: synthetic vision and VR), and Appendix (practical guidelines on structured work analysis, Questionaires, technical design fundamentals, signal detection theory / Bayes inference for data analysis, RTO/RTC simulator environment).

40|$|Abstract — Laser {{detection}} and tracking of aircrafts based systems (LIDARs, LIgth Detection And Ranging systems) are {{emerging as a}} critical design trend in development of new generation ATM (Air Traffic Management) paradigms, {{of which they are}} the main innovations. The realization of laser sensors as rotating laser range-finder arrays and their combination to versatile systems lead to major advantages for the application such as Air Traffic Control within <b>Aerodrome</b> <b>Traffic</b> Zone (ATZ), airport surveillance and ground to air laser communications, and last but not least to save cost usually at the same time with getting an improved ATC (Air Traffic Control) performance. These laser systems that today can be developed without particular difficulties are challenging classical ATM paradigms in many aspects. Nevertheless, it is commonly recognized that the effectiveness of these systems strictly relies on the capability to reliably perform a track data fusion with airpor...|$|E
