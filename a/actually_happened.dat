5|$|Militarily, it is {{difficult}} to draw many lessons from Salamis, because of the uncertainty about what <b>actually</b> <b>happened.</b> Once again the Allies chose their ground well in order to negate Persian numbers, but this time (unlike Thermopylae) had to rely on the Persians launching an unnecessary attack for their position to count. (Hale, John R.).|$|E

5|$|The Marian {{government}} {{produced a}} pamphlet with all six recantations plus {{the text of}} the speech Cranmer was to have made in the University Church. His subsequent withdrawal of his recantations was not mentioned, though what <b>actually</b> <b>happened</b> soon became common knowledge, undermining the effectiveness of Marian propaganda. Similarly, the Protestant party had difficulty in making use of the event, given Cranmer's recantations. The exiles' propaganda concentrated on publishing various specimens of his writings. Eventually John Foxe put Cranmer's story to effective use in 1559, and it features prominently in his Acts and Monuments when it was first printed in 1563.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} Marcellinus's act of traditio, {{if it ever}} <b>actually</b> <b>happened,</b> is unclear. There {{appears to}} have been a break in the episcopal succession, however. Marcellinus seems to have died on October 25, 304, and (if he had apostatized) was probably expelled from the church in early 303, but his successor, Marcellus, was not consecrated until either November or December 306. In the meantime, two factions diverged in the Roman church, separating the lapsed, Christians who had complied with the edicts to ensure their own safety, and the rigorists, those who would brook no compromise with secular authority. These two groups clashed in street fights and riots, eventually leading to murders. It is said that Marcellus, a rigorist, purged all mention of Marcellinus from church records, and removed his name from the official list of bishops. Marcellus himself was banished from the city, and died in exile on January 16, 309.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{missions}} {{were actually}} located along the Santa Ana River or within the watershed, the river basin was nearly depleted of native people because the Spanish {{forced them to}} work at nearby missions, including Mission San Gabriel Arcangel and Mission San Luis Rey. The affected tribes were usually renamed after the missions, resulting in tribal names such as Gabrieli침o and Luise침o. Difficult working and living conditions and European diseases such as smallpox killed much of the native population during the roughly 50-year-long Mission Period. The Secularization Act of 1833, passed by the newly independent country of Mexico, eventually brought {{an end to the}} Mission Period. The post-Mission Period native population was almost entirely devastated. The population was very little, their native religions were nearly lost, and most of their land had been taken by Spanish settlers. Although the Mexican government's original intention with the Secularization Act was to provide the Native Americans with their own land and property, most of the provisions made by the act never <b>actually</b> <b>happened.</b> Spanish settlers continued to press into the remaining tribal lands, and eventually, the tribes were forced into the surrounding desert lands or into the high mountains.|$|E

5|$|Learning from {{a runner}} that the Phocians had not held the path, Leonidas called a council of war at dawn. According to Diodorus, a Persian called Tyrrhastiadas, a Cymaean by birth, warned the Greeks. Some of the Greeks argued for withdrawal, but Leonidas {{resolved}} {{to stay at}} the pass with the Spartans. Upon discovering that his army had been encircled, Leonidas told his allies that they could leave if they wanted to. While many of the Greeks took him up on his offer and fled, around two thousand soldiers stayed behind to fight and die. Knowing that the end was near, the Greeks marched into the open field and met the Persians head-on. Many of the Greek contingents then either chose to withdraw (without orders) or were ordered to leave by Leonidas (Herodotus admits that there is some doubt about which <b>actually</b> <b>happened).</b> The contingent of 700 Thespians, led by their general Demophilus, refused to leave and committed themselves to the fight. Also present were the 400 Thebans and probably the helots who had accompanied the Spartans.|$|E
5|$|President Arthur {{departed}} Haifa on April 4 for a ten-day excursion in the Mediterranean, calling at Jaffa, Beirut, Alexandria, and Naples, among others, before sailing for the United States from Haifa on April 17. While docked at Naples on April 23, crewmen from President Arthur {{got into}} a confrontation {{with members of the}} Blackshirts, the Italian fascist paramilitary group. Five of the Blackshirts had broken noses and black eyes; five American seamen were arrested and a further 15 Americans swam out to their steamer to avoid arrest. After calling at Halifax, the liner docked at Pier 86 in New York on March 8, carrying among its cargo 75,000bags of onions from Alexandria, 16,000cases of lemons from Palermo, and two cases of Jaffa oranges for Nathan Straus. Only 500well-wishers greeted the ship, arriving as it did on the Jewish sabbath, but President Arthur was greeted by the largest police detail in many years because of rumors of a mutiny on board the ship. Sources are unclear as to what <b>actually</b> <b>happened</b> aboard the ship, but it is known that virtually the entire crew, including the captain, was replaced before the next voyage.|$|E
5|$|The film shows Luttrell (Wahlberg) {{being able}} to walk after the Taliban's ambush on the four-man SEAL team. In reality, Luttrell {{explained}} that his legs were numb immediately after the ambush, and when feeling did return to them, the pain from the shrapnel in his legs made it too painful to walk; he had to crawl seven miles looking for water and sanctuary. Luttrell {{also said that he}} did not witness the MH-47 Chinook helicopter being shot down, as seen in the film. At the end of the film, the Pashtun villagers fight off a Taliban attack in a firefight that never <b>actually</b> <b>happened.</b> In reality, the Taliban fighters were outnumbered by the villagers and had no intentions of attacking the village. They did, however, try to sneak in and capture Luttrell in secret. Luttrell also did not go into cardiac arrest after he was rescued, nor was he near death, as seen in the film.|$|E

5|$|William left England {{towards the}} end of 1086. Following his arrival back on the {{continent}} he married his daughter Constance to Alan Fergant, the Duke of Brittany, in furtherance of his policy of seeking allies against the French kings. William's son Robert, still allied with the French king Philip I, appears to have been active in stirring up trouble, enough so that William led an expedition against the French Vexin in July 1087. While seizing Mantes, William either fell ill or was injured by the pommel of his saddle. He was taken to the priory of Saint Gervase at Rouen, where he died on 9 September 1087. Knowledge of the events preceding his death is confused because there are two different accounts. Orderic Vitalis preserves a lengthy account, complete with speeches made by many of the principals, but this is likely more of an account of how a king should die than of what <b>actually</b> <b>happened.</b> The other, the De Obitu Willelmi, or On the Death of William, {{has been shown to be}} a copy of two 9th-century accounts with names changed.|$|E

25|$|Whether {{or not the}} German-Polish {{invasion}} of Bohemia <b>actually</b> <b>happened,</b> the friendly relations between the Czechs and the Poles came to an end. Bohemia resumed its earlier alliance with the Lutici, which caused in 990 a war with Mieszko, who was supported by Empress Theophanu. Duke Boleslav II was probably {{the first one to}} attack. As a result of the conflict Silesia was taken over by Poland. However, the annexation of Silesia possibly took place around 985, because during this year the major Piast strongholds in Wroc켹aw, Opole and G켹og칩w were already being built.|$|E

This can produce a pattern of prolonged periods of acute arousal punctuated by periods of physical and mental exhaustion.

The studios issued a joint press release announcing the single film collaboration in October, 1973.|$|E

The Nazis' first strike had <b>actually</b> <b>happened</b> during the battle with Mastermind, when the Red Skull took the plans for the computer and had Braddock Manor bombed to rubble (a later retcon said Mastermind had created a hologram that was bombed instead); Captain Britain was briefly believed dead and an empty coffin laid in state at St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E
