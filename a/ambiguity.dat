Andrew Todd of Gameplanet praised the game's manner of dealing with issues like inequality, theocracy, and causes of anti-Americanism, and noted that they help create the atmosphere of the story and setting. Eurogamer's Jeffrey Matulef found the narrative's moral <b>ambiguity</b> refreshing, particularly the depiction of corrupting good people. He felt that the development team being primarily Iranian added to the game's authenticity. Kotakus Evan Narcisse similarly appreciated the <b>ambiguity,</b> noting its close imitation to the era. The choices presented in the game split reviewers; some found them important and scary, while others found them ultimately inconsequential.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{studies in}} {{decentralized}} settings associate <b>ambiguities</b> {{in the division}} of responsibilities between government spheres with coordination problems. This study explores the mechanisms behind this association, mainly drawing on in-depth interviews with local government officials in Poland. A typology emerges from the data. <b>Ambiguities</b> can refer to the policy content, {{but also to the}} rationale behind responsibilities. They may be real or perceived. The agent who perceives the <b>ambiguities</b> can be close to public administration (internal) or further removed from it (external). External <b>ambiguities</b> mostly inhibit front-room stages of the policy cycle, while external <b>ambiguities</b> impede back-room stages. Through different paths, they contribute to tensions between government spheres, obstructing cooperation needed to address the <b>ambiguities.</b> Overall, the article contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the policy process in decentralized settings, unwraps the dynamic causal framework surrounding the <b>ambiguities,</b> and highlights the role of perceptions, not only by the electorate, but by public officials in particular...|$|R

40|$|The {{solution}} of the current wind retrieval algorithm for scatterometers has several wind vector <b>ambiguities,</b> due to the bi-harmonic relationship between normalized backscattering cross section and the relative wind direction {{and the existence of}} the measurement error. In order to remove the <b>ambiguities</b> for a unique wind field, a circular median filter approach (CMF) is usually adopted. But under the condition for clustering distribution of the false <b>ambiguities</b> in some local areas, the CMF fails and thus engenders block <b>ambiguities,</b> which degrade the precision of the retrieved wind field. For such a situation, a technique of identification and removal of the block <b>ambiguities</b> is presented to further optimize the retrieved wind field after CMF. It is demonstrated in experiment that this technique can identify and remove most of the block <b>ambiguities...</b>|$|R

In this study we hypothesized that the removal of these MHR-FHR <b>ambiguities</b> would improve FHR analysis during the final hour of labor. Methods: Sixty-one MHR and FHR recordings were simultaneously acquired in the final hour of labor. Removal of MHR-FHR <b>ambiguities</b> was performed by subtracting MHR signals from their FHR counterparts when the absolute {{difference between the two}} was less or equal to 5 beats per minute. Major MHR-FHR <b>ambiguities</b> were defined when they exceeded 1 % of the tracing. Maternal, fetal and neonatal characteristics were evaluated in cases where major MHR-FHR <b>ambiguities</b> occurred and computer analysis of FHR recordings was compared, before and after removal of the <b>ambiguities.</b> Results: Seventy-two percent of tracings (44 / 61) exhibited episodes of major MHR-FHR <b>ambiguities,</b> which were not significantly associated with any maternal, fetal or neonatal characteristics, but were associated with MHR accelerations, FHR signal loss and decelerations. Removal of MHR-FHR <b>ambiguities</b> resulted in a significant decrease in FHR decelerations, and improvement in FHR tracing classification. Conclusions: FHR interpretation during the final hour of labor can be significantly improved by the removal of MHR-FHR <b>ambiguities...</b>|$|R
