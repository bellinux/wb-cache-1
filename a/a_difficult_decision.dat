25|$|Having {{received}} {{repeated and}} cryptic cablegrams from her husband, who {{had returned to}} Norway {{a year and a}} half earlier, Flagstad was forced to consider leaving the United States in 1941. Though dismissing the political implications of the departure of someone of her fame from the United States to German-occupied Norway, it was nonetheless <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>decision</b> for her. She had many friends, colleagues, and of course many fans all over the US. Even more importantly, her 20-year-old daughter Else had married an American named Arthur Dusenberry and was living with her new husband on a dude ranch in Bozeman, Montana. It was Edwin McArthur who gave the bride away at the wedding in Bozeman a year earlier. Nonetheless, against the best advice of her friends and colleagues, including former president Herbert Hoover, who pleaded with her to stay out of Europe, she returned to Norway via Lisbon, Madrid, Barcelona, Marseille, and Berlin in April, 1941. Though during the war she performed only in Sweden and Switzerland, countries not occupied by German forces, this fact did not temper the storm of public opinion that hurt her personally and professionally for the next several years. Her husband was arrested after the war for profiteering during the occupation that involved his lumber business. This arrest, together with her decision to remain in occupied Norway, made her unpopular, particularly in the United States. The Norwegian ambassador and columnist Walter Winchell spoke out against her. In 1948, she performed several benefit concerts for the United Jewish Appeal. In defense of Flagstad's husband, Henry Johansen, it should be noted that after his death it was revealed that during the occupation he was arrested by the Gestapo and held for eight days. Also, one of Johansen's sons by his first marriage, Henry Jr, had been a member of the Norwegian underground throughout the war.|$|E

500|$|Solis, who {{had never}} {{become part of the}} inner circle of presidential advisors, said it had been <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>decision</b> and Obama praised her work as secretary. [...] Reflecting upon her tenure, Solis {{generally}} garnered praise from labor unions and leading Democrats for her stricter enforcement of job safety regulations and more aggressive pursuit of wage and hour violators. Other leaders and analysts in the labor field thought her performance as secretary was underwhelming, with minimal public visibility and no memorable legacy left behind. [...] All agreed that she operated in a difficult political environment, with the effects of the Great Recession still being felt, Republicans staunchly opposed to labor-based initiatives, and the Obama administration's attentions focused elsewhere. Business groups, meanwhile, continued to characterize her as having been uncooperative in her dealings with them.|$|E

His advisers were divided on the issue, and the king ultimately decided on the latter route. The wisdom of this decision has been questioned, since the Danish defenses were in poor shape initially. However, the population of Copenhagen rallied behind Frederick III, and the walls, moats and other defensive structures of the city were quickly improved. A large number of cannons were brought into the city from ships anchored in the harbor and placed along likely attack routes. The city also had plenty of defensive materiel: [...] of lead, 4,000 muskets, and a staggering [...] of slow match.|$|E

Angelou marries a white man, whose appreciation of Black music breaks her stereotype of whites. This is <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>decision</b> for Angelou, and she must justify it by rationalizing that Tosh is Greek, and not an American white.

500|$|Originally, Descent 3 was {{intended}} to support both a software and a hardware renderer, implying that the rendering process of the game could take place either in the CPU or dedicated hardware like a video card. However, about six months after starting development, the team decided {{to go with a}} hardware-only renderer because it allowed them to create [...] "visually stunning" [...] graphics and maintain a solid frame rate without worrying about the limitations imposed by the software renderer. This was <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>decision</b> since the team had to scrap many tools and software rendering technology that were already developed. In addition, computers with hardware acceleration were not common at the time the decision was made. As the developers noted, [...] "We knew just by looking at our progress on the game under acceleration that we had a beautiful looking game with all the latest technologies — but would anyone actually be able to play it?" [...] Fortunately, as development progressed, hardware acceleration became more popular with each passing year.
