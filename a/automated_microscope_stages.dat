40|$|Beer is {{a hostile}} {{environment}} for most microorganisms, but some lactic acid bacteria can grow in this environment. This is primarily because these organisms have developed the ability {{to grow in the}} presence of hops. It has been speculated that hop resistance is inversely correlated to resistance against oxidation, and this would have great impact on the use of various disinfectants in the brewing industry. In this study, we cultivated bacteria under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and then investigated the in situ outgrowth of individual cells into microcolonies on MRS agar after exposure to the oxidizing agent peracetic acid (PAA). An <b>automated</b> <b>microscope</b> <b>stage</b> allowed us to analyse a much larger number of cells over extended periods of incubation. After PAA treatment, the lag time increased markedly, and extensive variation in morphology, µmax as well as stress resistance was observed between and within the tested L. brevis strains. The results suggest that aerobic cultivation increased the oxidative stress tolerance in L. brevis. The results also show that dead cells are randomly distributed in a microcolony and the majority of non-growing individual cells do not stain with a membrane impermanent dye (Propidium iodide), which indicates that PAA may not destroy the plasma membrane. In conclusion, the developed microscopic analysis of individual cells on MRS agar can provides faster results and more details of cell physiology compared to the traditional CFU method...|$|R
40|$|Context: Mosaics of Whole Slides (WS) are a {{valuable}} resource for pathologists to have the whole sample available at high resolution. The WS mosaic provides pathologists with {{an overview of the}} whole sample at a glance, helping them to make a reliable diagnosis. Despite recent solutions exist for creating WS mosaics based, for instance, on <b>automated</b> <b>microscopes</b> with motorized <b>stages</b> or WS scanner, most of the histopathology analysis are still performed in laboratories endowed with standard manual <b>stage</b> <b>microscopes.</b> Nowadays, there are lots of dedicated devices and hardware to achieve WS automatically and in batch, but only few of them are conceived to work tightly connected with a microscope and none of them is capable of working in real-time with common light microscopes. However, there is a need of having low-cost yet effective mosaicing applications even in small laboratories to improve routine histopathological analyses or to perform remote diagnoses. Aims: The purpose of this work is to study and develop a real-time mosaicing algorithm working even using non-automated microscopes, to enable pathologists to achieve WS while moving the holder manually, without exploiting any dedicated device. This choice enables pathologists to build WS in real-time, while browsing the sample as they are accustomed to, helping them to identify, locate, and digitally annotate lesions fast. Materials and Methods: Our method exploits fast feature tracker and frame to frame registration that we implemented on common graphics processing unit cards. The system work with common light microscopes endowed with a digital camera and connected to a commodity personal computer. Result and Conclusion: The system has been tested on several histological samples to test the effectiveness of the algorithm to work with mosaicing having different appearances as far as brightness, contrast, texture, and detail levels are concerned, attaining sub-pixel registration accuracy at real-time interactive rates...|$|R

50|$|The {{advent of}} <b>automated</b> <b>microscopes</b> that can acquire many images {{automatically}} {{is one of}} the reasons why analysis cannot be done by eye (otherwise, annotation would rapidly become the research bottleneck). Using <b>automated</b> <b>microscopes</b> means that some images might be out-of-focus (automated focus finding systems may sometimes be incorrect), contain a small number of cells, or be filled with debris. Therefore, the images generated will be harder to analyse than images acquired by an operator as they would have chosen other locations to image and focus correctly. On the other hand, the operator might introduce an unconscious bias in his selection by choosing only the cells whose phenotype is most like the one expected before the experiment.|$|R
