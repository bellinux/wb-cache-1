5|$|As few Susan B. Anthony dollars circulated, many remain {{available}} in uncirculated condition and are worth little above face value. However, some date and mint mark varieties are relatively valuable. The 1981 coins, having been issued only to collectors, are valued above the other circulation strikes in the series. In addition, a well-known {{variety of the}} 1979 circulation strikes on which the date appears nearer to the rim commands <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>price</b> than the regular issue.|$|E
5|$|An Adventurous Automobile Trip premiered at {{the gala}} opening {{night of the}} Folies Bergère revue on 31 December 1904. It ran for six months at the Folies Bergère, lasting more than 300 performances. Méliès also {{intended}} for the film to be shown by exhibitors elsewhere, outside {{the context of the}} revue. Thus, after its Folies Bergère run, it was released as a standalone item by Méliès's Star Film Company and numbered 740–749 in its catalogues, where it is advertised as a grande course fantastique funambulesque. As with at least fourpercent of Méliès's output, the film was available both in black-and-white and in individually hand-colored prints sold at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>price.</b>|$|E
5|$|Far Harbor was {{developed}} by Bethesda Game Studios and was announced {{three months after the}} official release of Fallout 4—alongside , , and teasers of other upcoming expansions—in a blog post on February 16, 2016.. The expansion was released on May 19, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Of the first three expansions, Far Harbor added the largest landmass, and was consequently sold at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>price.</b> It also added new dungeons (self-contained quest locations), quests, creatures, and other miscellaneous features. The expansion was included in the Fallout 4 season pass, a collection of all the expansion packs. Because of the large amount of additional content, the price for the pass was increased from US$30 to $50.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the game's standard edition, players could purchase a Premium Edition at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>price.</b> Players who pre-ordered the game at selected retailers were able to have their games upgraded to the Premium Edition at no additional cost. The Premium Edition grants players additional advantages in the multiplayer segment of the game, including an experience points boost and early access to the Officer class. A multiplayer beta for selected applicants on the Xbox 360 platform was held in 2010. A playable demo of the game, which featured two chapters {{from the beginning of}} the campaign, was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on May 8, 2012.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} occupations could be chosen or {{inherited}} from a father's line of work. This would include – {{but was not}} limited to – coffinmakers, ironworkers and blacksmiths, tailors, cooks and noodle-makers, retail merchants, tavern, teahouse, or winehouse managers, shoemakers, seal cutters, pawnshop owners, brothel heads, and merchant bankers engaging in a proto-banking system involving notes of exchange. Virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had. Male catamites fetched <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>price</b> than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status, regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms. Public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods. Urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices, specialized luxury goods, headgear, fine cloth, teas, and others. Smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers. A small township also provided a place for simple schooling, news and gossip, matchmaking, religious festivals, traveling theater groups, tax collection, and bases of famine relief distribution.|$|E
5|$|Many {{circumstances}} surrounding the film—including its unusual budget, length, and production time, {{as well as its}} similarities to the 1901 New York attraction—indicate that Méliès was especially keen to release the film in the United States. Because of rampant film piracy, Méliès never received most of the profits of the popular film. One account reports that Méliès sold a print of the film to the Paris photographer Charles Gerschel for use in an Algiers theatre, under strict stipulation that the print only be shown in Algeria. Gerschel sold the print, and various other Méliès films, to the Edison Manufacturing Company employee Alfred C. Abadie, who sent them directly to Edison's laboratories to be duplicated and sold by Vitagraph. Copies of the print spread to other firms, and by 1904 Siegmund Lubin, the Selig Polyscope Company, and Edison were all redistributing it. Edison's print of the film was even offered in a hand-colored version available at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>price,</b> just as Méliès had done. Méliès was often uncredited altogether; {{for the first six months}} of the film's distribution, the only American exhibitor to credit Méliès in advertisements for the film was Thomas Lincoln Tally, who chose the film as the inaugural presentation of his Electric Theater.|$|E

5|$|The Steam store also enables {{users to}} redeem store product keys to add {{software}} from their library. The keys are sold by third-party providers such as Humble Bundle (in which {{a portion of}} the sale is given back to the publisher or distributor), distributed as part of a physical release to redeem the game, or given to a user as part of promotions, often used to deliver Kickstarter and other crowd funding rewards. A grey market exists around Steam keys, where less reputable buyers purchase a large number of Steam keys for a game when it is offered for a low cost, and then resell these keys to users or other third-party sites at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>price,</b> generating profit for themselves. This caused some of these third-party sites, like G2A, to be embroiled in this grey market. It is possible for publishers to have Valve to track down where specific keys have been used and cancel them, removing the product from the user's libraries, leaving the user to seek any recourse with the third-party they purchased from. Other legitimate storefronts, like Humble Bundle, have set a minimum price that must be spent to obtain Steam keys as to discourage mass purchases that would enter the grey market.|$|E
