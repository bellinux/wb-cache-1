5|$|The College of <b>All</b> <b>Saints</b> was an ecclesiastical {{college in}} Maidstone, Kent, England, founded in 1395 by Archbishop Courtenay. It {{was part of}} the {{establishment}} of the nearby Archbishop's Palace, but was closed in 1546. The College church was the neighbouring Church of <b>All</b> <b>Saints.</b> Following its closure, the College estate was sold. The buildings and land passed through the ownership of three aristocratic families, being farmed until the late 19th century. A number of the College's buildings survive and all are listed buildings. Additionally, the whole site of the College is protected as a scheduled monument.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{church on}} the site was named All Hallows, and was constructed in medieval times on land granted by the monarch at the time, Henry II, to the monks of St. Denys Priory. This building fell into disrepair and in the 1790s a new church building was constructed and the church renamed to <b>All</b> <b>Saints.</b> The old church was demolished in 1791 and the new building was completed in 1795, following two acts of Parliament allowing trustees {{of the church to}} raise funds from rates on property and rents in the parish. The All Hallows catacombs were incorporated into the <b>All</b> <b>Saints</b> building, and a separate graveyard was established. The church was regularly attended by author Jane Austen while she lived in Southampton and painter Sir John Everett Millais was baptised there. A new organ was installed in the church in 1861 and a substantial refurbishment programme took place in 1872. <b>All</b> <b>Saints</b> was heavily damaged in the Southampton Blitz and was subsequently demolished.|$|E

5|$|Architecturally {{this was}} an {{exciting}} period, but Honoré I was unable to remodel the fortress in the grand style of a Renaissance palazzo. In spite of the Spanish protection, the risk of attack from France was high and defence remained Honoré's main priority. With this in mind he added two new features: <b>All</b> <b>Saints</b> Tower (F) and the Serravalle Bastion (G). <b>All</b> <b>Saints</b> Tower was semi-circular and guarded {{the end of the}} rock promontory. Complete with gun platforms and cannon, it was connected to man-made caves in the rock itself. Subterranean passages also linked it to the Serravalle Bastion, which was in essence a three-storey gun tower bristling with cannon. Underneath the courtyard a cistern was installed, providing sufficient water for 1000 troops for a 20-month siege, with a huge vaulted ceiling supported by nine columns. Monaco was to remain politically vulnerable for another century and little building work took place from 1581 until 1604, during the reigns of Prince Charles II and Prince Hercule.|$|E
