40|$|This is {{the first}} book to focus on how racism affects the housing choices {{available}} to black <b>and</b> other <b>ethnic</b> minority groups <b>and</b> how this contributes to social exclusion. Using a practical approach, the contributors analyse the implications of social exclusion, offering suggestions for good practice in the allocation of housing for black <b>and</b> other <b>ethnic</b> minority groups. 'Race', Housing and Social Exclusion shows how racism and the shortage of housing workers from black <b>and</b> other <b>ethnic</b> minorities constrain the choices available to these groups, thereby preventing them from having {{an active role in}} society. Each chapter investigates a different aspect of the situation that black <b>and</b> other <b>ethnic</b> minority groups face, including: their housing needs; the procedure of the allocation of housing; patterns of housing settlement of black <b>and</b> other <b>ethnic</b> minority groups; the employment of black <b>and</b> other <b>ethnic</b> minority staff in housing associations. This book also gives examples of the experiences and aspirations of black <b>and</b> other <b>ethnic</b> minority groups <b>and</b> relates them to subjects such as cultural differences within and among black <b>and</b> other <b>ethnic</b> minority groups, <b>and</b> the further social exclusion which arises from housing associations which help a specific ethnic minority group 'Race', Housing and Social Exclusion challenges existing views, which are based on broad generalisations of black <b>and</b> other <b>ethnic</b> minority groups, <b>and</b> also points to future policy making and strategic planning...|$|R

5|$|Most {{of these}} loanwords for food dishes and their {{ingredients}} are Hokkien in origin, {{and are used}} throughout the Indonesian language and vernacular speech of large cities. Because they have {{become an integral part}} of the local language, many Indonesians <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> Chinese do not recognize their Hokkien origins. Some popular Indonesian dishes such as nasi goreng, lumpia, and bakpia can trace their origin to Chinese influence. Some food and ingredients are part of the daily diet of both the indigenous <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> Chinese populations as side dishes to accompany rice, the staple food of most of the country. Among ethnic Chinese families, both peranakan and totok, pork is generally preferred as meat; this is in contrast with traditional Indonesian cuisine, which in majority-Muslim areas avoids the meat. The consumption of pork has, however, decreased in recent years owing to a recognition of its contribution to health hazards such as high cholesterol levels and heart disease.|$|E
