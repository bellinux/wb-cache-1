5|$|At {{the time}} of the announcement, it was stated that the {{original}} goal was to transmit the six-part adaptation of the third novel starting in February 2004, with the remaining eight episodes comprising the final two novels. A fourth and fifth series based on So Long, <b>and</b> <b>Thanks</b> <b>For</b> All the Fish and Mostly Harmless were to have been transmitted in September 2004.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{considered}} {{writing a}} third radio series {{to be based}} on his novel Life, the Universe and Everything in 1993, but the project did not begin until after his death in 2001. Dirk Maggs, with whom Adams had discussed the new series, directed and co-produced the radio adaptation as well as adaptations of the remaining Hitchhiker's Guide novels So Long, <b>and</b> <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> All the Fish and Mostly Harmless. These became the third, fourth and fifth radio series, transmitted in 2004 and 2005.|$|E

25|$|A sequel, The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul, was {{published}} a year later. This was an entirely original work, Adams's first since So Long, <b>and</b> <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> All the Fish.

25|$|In So Long, <b>and</b> <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> All the Fish (published in 1984), Arthur {{returns home}} to Earth, rather {{surprisingly}} {{since it was}} destroyed when he left. He meets and {{falls in love with}} a girl named Fenchurch, and discovers this Earth is a replacement provided by the dolphins in their Save the Humans campaign. Eventually he rejoins Ford, who claims to have saved the Universe in the meantime, to hitch-hike one last time and see God's Final Message to His Creation. Along the way, they are joined by Marvin, the Paranoid Android, who, although 37 times older than the universe itself (what with time travel and all), has just enough power left in his failing body to read the message and feel better about it all before expiring.|$|E

25|$|The {{adaptation}} of the third novel followed the book very closely, which caused major structural issues in meshing with the preceding radio series {{in comparison to the}} second novel. Because many events from the radio series were omitted from the second novel, and those that did occur happened in a different order, the two series split in completely different directions. The last two adaptations vary somewhat—some events in Mostly Harmless are now foreshadowed in the {{adaptation of}} So Long <b>and</b> <b>Thanks</b> <b>For</b> All The Fish, while both include some additional material that builds on incidents in the third series to tie all five (and their divergent plotlines) together, most especially including the character Zaphod more prominently in the final chapters and addressing his altered reality to include the events of the Secondary Phase. While Mostly Harmless originally contained a rather bleak ending, Dirk Maggs created a different ending for the transmitted radio version, ending it on a much more upbeat note, reuniting the cast one last time.|$|E
25|$|For {{many of the}} {{hundreds}} of thousands of people who visit Graceland each year, the visit takes on a quasi-religious perspective. They may plan for years to journey to the home of the ‘King’ of rock and roll. On site, headphones narrate the salient events of Elvis’s life and introduce the relics that adorn the rooms and corridors. The rhetorical mode is hagiographic, celebrating the life of an extraordinary man, emphasizing his generosity, his kindness and good fellowship, how he was at once a poor boy who made good, an extraordinary musical talent, a sinner and substance abuser, and a religious man devoted to the Gospel and its music. At the meditation garden, containing Elvis’s grave, some visitors pray, kneel, or quietly sing one of Elvis’s favorite hymns. The brick wall that encloses the mansion's grounds is covered with graffiti that express an admiration for the singer as well as petitions for help <b>and</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> favors granted.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Kevin Davies {{wrote and}} {{directed}} a documentary entitled The Making of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Davies had previously worked on the stage show at the Rainbow Theatre, and, while working for Pierce Animation Studios in 1980, had introduced Alan Bell to Rod Lord, leading to the animation for the TV series. For the documentary, Davies used many photographs and home movies he shot during the 1980 production of the series and recorded new interviews in October 1992 with the cast and crew. New footage of Simon Jones, David Dixon and Michael Cule, in character, were shot at the farm in Sussex used as Arthur Dent's house, and incorporated into the documentary with some references to So Long, <b>and</b> <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> All the Fish, such as Arthur finding his home intact, and placing his (animated) Babel fish into a goldfish bowl. BBC video released the sixty-minute documentary on VHS in 1993. Footage {{not included in the}} original documentary was included in the 2002 DVD release of the series. The documentary itself has not (as of 2005) been transmitted on TV.|$|E

500|$|Sunday, November 6 was a {{day when}} houses of worship in Honolulu offered prayers <b>and</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> the divine {{protection}} and safe return of their monarch. The Catholic Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Honolulu conducted the Te Deum hymn of praise. Attended by Kalākaua and Kapiolani, the King's ministry, {{and much of the}} Hawaiian government, thanks were given for divine protection during the royal journey. Former missionary Rev. Sereno E. Bishop of the Fort Street Church praised the King's historic journey, but condemned the Hawaiian culture for its [...] "decrepit paganism" [...] and [...] "bestialities of the hula hula". Kalākaua and Kapiolani attended the services at the Anglican Saint Andrew's Cathedral as private individuals, to hear a sermon on the Parable of the talents or minas based on the Gospel of Luke 19:13, [...] "And he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, 'Make use of it till I come.'" ...|$|E
