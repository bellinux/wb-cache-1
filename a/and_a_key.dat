Freeing {{for the first time}} the manufacturing capacity of human society from the limited availability of hand, water and animal power, this was arguably the pivotal moment of the entire industrial revolution <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> factor in the worldwide increases in productivity that would follow over the following century.|$|E

5|$|As State Secretary Reitz had a {{complicated}} and hefty job. After the State President {{he was the}} most important member of the Executive Council (Uitvoerende Raad). As the most senior civil servant he was responsible for the oversight over the implementation of the laws and regulations, as well as for all the correspondence of the President, official government reports, etc. He was also an intermediary between the Executive Council and parliament, the First and Second Volksraad, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> figure in the foreign affairs of the State. Experienced and well organised as he himself was Reitz managed to quickly modernise the structure of the state apparatus, by implementing regulations for the running of the government departments, appointing an archivist for his own, and by prescribing that all correspondence with the government should be in Dutch.|$|E

5|$|In July 1906, Ernest Thompson Seton sent Baden-Powell {{a copy of}} his 1902 book The Birchbark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians. Seton, a British-born Canadian-American {{living in}} the United States, met Baden-Powell in October 1906, and they shared ideas about youth {{training}} programs. In 1907 Baden-Powell wrote a draft called Boy Patrols. In the same year, to test his ideas, he gathered 21 boys of mixed social backgrounds (from boy's schools in the London area and a section of boys from the Poole, Parkstone, Hamworthy, Bournemouth, and Winton Boys' Brigade units) and held a week-long camp in August on Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, Dorset, England. His organizational method, now known as the Patrol System <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> part of Scouting training, allowed the boys to organize themselves into small groups with an elected patrol leader.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, Savimbi forged close {{relationships}} with influential conservatives, including Michael Johns (The Heritage Foundation's foreign policy analyst <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> Savimbi advocate), Grover Norquist (President of Americans for Tax Reform and a Savimbi economic advisor), and others, who played critical roles in elevating escalated U.S. covert aid to Savimbi's UNITA and visited with Savimbi in his Jamba, Angola headquarters {{to provide the}} Angolan rebel leader with military, political and other guidance in his war against the MPLA government. With enhanced U.S. support, the war quickly escalated, {{both in terms of}} the intensity of the conflict and also in its perception as a key conflict in the overall Cold War.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his existing circle of supporters, {{many of whom were}} richly rewarded with new lands, Henry quickly co-opted many of the existing administration into his new royal household. William Giffard, William Rufus's chancellor, was made the Bishop of Winchester, and the prominent sheriffs Urse d'Abetot, Haimo Dapifer and Robert Fitzhamon continued to play a senior role in government. By contrast, the unpopular Ranulf Flambard, the Bishop of Durham <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> member of the previous regime, was imprisoned in the Tower of London and charged with corruption. The late king had left many church positions unfilled, and Henry set about nominating candidates to these, in an effort to build further support for his new government. The appointments needed to be consecrated, and Henry wrote to Anselm, apologising for having been crowned while the Archbishop was still in France and asking him to return at once.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes, {{a single}} rank of pipes {{may be able}} to be {{controlled}} by several stops, allowing the rank to be played at multiple pitches or on multiple manuals. Such a rank is said to be unified or borrowed. For example, an 8 Diapason rank may also be made available as a 4 Octave. When both of these stops are selected <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> (for example, c) is pressed, two pipes of the same rank will sound: the pipe normally corresponding to the key played (c), and the pipe one octave above that (c). Because the 8 rank does not have enough pipes to sound the top octave of the keyboard at 4 pitch, it is common for an extra octave of pipes used only for the borrowed 4 stop to be added. In this case, the full rank of pipes (now an extended rank) is one octave longer than the keyboard.|$|E

5|$|UConn went unbeaten {{through the}} Conference {{regular season and}} Tournament and easily {{advanced}} into the NCAA Tournament; in the regional final against Virginia a 4-points win in their closest {{game of the year}} opened the doors of the Final Four at the Target Center in Minneapolis. UConn blew out Stanford in the semifinals behind Wolters' 31 points, reaching the championship game for a rematch against Tennessee. In the final game UConn found itself in early trouble when Lobo was called for three personal fouls in 94 seconds in the first half, but in the second half the team was able to rally from a 9-point deficit <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> Rizzotti layup gave UConn the lead with less than 2 minutes to go, a lead that the team kept until the final score of 70–64 and their first national title.

5|$|Not {{everything}} was going well with the Confederate advance. By 9:30a.m., as the lead Union brigades were falling back, Nathan Bedford Forrest urged Bushrod Johnson to launch an all-out attack on the disorganized troops. Johnson was too cautious to approve of a general assault, but he did agree to keep the infantry moving slowly forward. Two hours into the battle, Gen. Pillow realized that Buckner's wing was not attacking alongside his. After a confrontation between the two generals, Buckner's troops moved out and, combined with the right flank of Pillow's wing, hit W. H. L. Wallace's brigade. The Confederates took control of Forge Road <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> section of Wynn's Ferry Road, opening a route to Nashville, but Buckner's delay provided time for Lew Wallace's men to reinforce McClernand's retreating forces before they were completely routed. Despite Grant's earlier orders, Wallace's units moved to the right with Thayer's brigade, giving McClernand's men time to regroup and gather ammunition from Wallace's supplies. The 68th Ohio was left behind to protect the rear.|$|E

5|$|One of history's great Chiefs of Staff <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> {{member of}} the Imperial Staff, Schmitt was the most {{experienced}} Austrian leader, called out of retirement for this specific task of organizing the Austro-Russian retreat. He had wide experience as a leader: From the summer of 1796 {{until his retirement in}} 1800, he had been Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army, of the Lower Rhine, the Rhine, and the Army of Germany, and a trusted member of Archduke Charles' staff. Consequently, he had organized a variety of maneuvers and battle plans under different terrain. The military historian Digby Smith hypothesizes that Schmitt, an experienced officer and sound tactician, would have been more effective at the Battle of Austerlitz, at least more effective than his replacement, Franz von Weyrother, as Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Allied Army. After Schmitt's death, Weyrother, the architect of the Austrian defeat at Hohenlinden, developed the general battle plan of the Allied action at Austerlitz. In the long run, it was unlikely that Schmitt's plan would have changed the overall outcome—Austerlitz was arguably one of Napoleon's finest battles—but his battle plan would no doubt have been an improvement over the one the Allies used.|$|E
