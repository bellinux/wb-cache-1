40|$|Following the {{complete}} eradication of smallpox in 1979, rinderpest looks set {{to become the}} second disease in history to be wiped {{off the face of}} the Earth. Although it does not directly attack humans, its devastating effect on livestock is responsible for high malnutrition and mortality rates in people living in several countries of the South. In Africa, the Pan-African Programme for the Control of Epizootics (PACE) is heading a network to combat and monitor the disease. To date, 12 of the 30 member countries have already been declared free of rinderpest infection. This is the top level of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>certification</b> offered by PACE. It comes into force 3 years after a country has declared itself to be provisionally free of rinderpest, provided that international controls, carried out under the auspices of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), have not revealed any fresh cases in the meantime. This stage of certification is given when animals have neither been vaccinated, nor contracted the disease for a period of 3 years. After a further period of at least 1 year, a country that respects the strictest standards for rinderpest may be given the highest grade of certification available from PACE: freedom from rinderpest infection. Five countries were due to be declared rinderpest free during the course of 2005. The goal of the rinderpest programme is complete eradication before the 2010 deadline. OIE sees current progress in tackling this disease as particulalry encouraging since it marks the first time that a significant number of sub-Saharan African countries have been able to collectively satisfy international animal health standards. Eradicating the disease will not just enable these countries to feed their people. It will also put them in a position to access regional and international markets for animal products such as meat, hides and dairy products...|$|E

30|$|Training in {{livestock}} health {{provision was}} reported by respondents (58.8  %) as a strategy to reduce risks associated with recurrent drought and livestock diseases. The increased number of trained, community-based <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> workers now operating in Turkana areas is an important <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> delivery channel in this marginal area (Mugunieri et al. 2004). Of the livestock keepers who had treated their animals, 85  % claimed to have gained skills, training, and knowledge from the community-based <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> workers. Traditionally the control of livestock diseases was {{through the use of}} local herbs and local techniques; these practices seem to have changed with the emergence of trained community-based <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> workers. Key informants revealed that many youth with <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> care skills are able to support their families with income earned from the sale of veterinary drugs and from attending to sick animals. But owing to the limited training and literacy of community-based <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> workers, these medical providers have been perceived by professional veterinarians and government officials {{as a threat to the}} provision of adequate <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> services (Mugunieri et al. 2004).|$|R
40|$|The {{quantity}} of research information being made {{available on the}} World Wide Web in various disciplines is increasing tremendously. This study examined the coverage of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information published on the web from Africa or about Africa. Challenges and opportunities of publishing and disseminating <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information online in Africa were also examined. Websites and online databases which offer agricultural information {{were included in the}} analysis, but the main focus was on research, education and extension information in the core areas of <b>animal</b> <b>health.</b> Content analysis method was used to determine what agricultural academic indexing and abstracting databases have in terms of quality researched <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information published from Africa or about Africa. Well-known databases, such as AGRICOLA, AGRIS, CAB Direct, PUBMED and Cochrane Library were investigated. The criteria used to determine the African <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information included the content of research <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information available on the website, {{how easy it is to}} locate information once the site has been located, the usefulness of the information, and how current and up-to-date the information is. It was found that the representation of African <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information on the web is generally low. The poor coverage of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information on the web emanates from many factors: poor ICT (Information Communications Technology) infrastructure in many African countries, lack of ICT literacy, awareness and mindset, lack of recognition of all the values of information services, poor state of African indexing and abstracting services, inadequate funds, and perceived misconceptions of actual causes of the problem. Thus, this situation has led to the web being dominated by the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information from developed countries. Despite the challenges faced by African researchers in publishing their research findings on the web, most <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> scholars collaborate well with some international organizations in disseminating <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information on the web.

40|$|The {{way that}} an {{economist}} and an <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> professional use economics differs and creates frustrations. The economist is {{in search of}} optimizing resource allocation {{in the management of}} <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> and disease problems with metrics associated with the productivity of key societal resources of labour and capital. The <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> professional have a strong belief that productivity can be improved with the removal of pathogens. These differences restrict how well economics is used in <b>animal</b> <b>health,</b> and the question posed is whether this matters. The paper explores the question by looking at the changing role of animals in society and the associated change of the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> professional's activities. It then questions if the current allocation of scarce resources for <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> are adequately allocated for societies and whether currently available data are sufficient for good allocation. A rapid review of the data on disease impacts - production losses and costs of human reaction - indicate that the data are sparse collected in different times and geographical regions. This limits what can be understood on the productivity of the economic resources used for <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> and this needs to be addressed with more systematic collection of data on disease losses and costs of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> systems. Ideally such a process should learn lessons from the way that human health has made estimates of the burden of diseases and their capture of data on the costs of human health systems. Once available data on the global burden of animal diseases and the costs of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> systems would allow assessments of individual disease management processes and the productivity of wider productivity change. This utopia should be aimed at if <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> is to continue to attract and maintain adequate resources...|$|R

40|$|It {{is argued}} that while {{considerable}} development of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> economics has occurred in recent decades, {{it has not yet}} achieved its potential coverage. It has been mostly applied to livestock, particularly livestock used for commerce, and its application to a range of other animals has been relatively neglected. Extending its coverage also requires widening the type of objectives taken into account in the analysis. Furthermore, the main focus of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> economics has been on the economics of controlling and managing the occurrence of diseases. The economic role of genetics, the environment, nutrition and the comfort of <b>animals</b> in their <b>health</b> ought to be given greater attention. In the case of zoonoses, the economic analysis should be extended to take into account human <b>health.</b> Those studying <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> economics need to make decisions in their analysis about its spatial dimensions, its time dimensions, and the stakeholders to be considered. They must also take into account health chains and make allowances for risk and uncertainty. The economics of knowledge (including, for example, information economics and research and development) is worthy of more attention in <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> economics. Many important questions arise in <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> economics but two big ones might be: (1) what role should governments play in managing <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> and how should their involvement be financed; and (2) what precautions for maintaining <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> are economic?
