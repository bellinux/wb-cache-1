[...] Such an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>repudiation</b> is designed to signal to centrist voters that the politician is not beholden to traditional, and sometimes unpopular, interest groups associated with the party, although such a repudiation runs the risk of alienating some of the politician's allies and the party's base voters.

5000|$|Born in London, Behnes {{was the son}} of a Hanoverian pianoforte-maker and his English wife. He was {{the younger}} brother of William Behnes, also a sculptor. Both {{brothers}} were determined in their choice of a profession by the same circumstance. Henry, being a much inferior artist, was honourably anxious to prevent confusion in the public mind, and took the name of Burlowe. The irregularities of William Behnes are considered to have added a strong incentive to this <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>repudiation.</b> Henry exhibited at the Academy in 1831 - 33. He afterwards went to Rome, and was much employed as a bust modeller. He died of cholera in that city in August 1837. According to an account in the The Art Journal he was a person 'of sterling character and generous impulses, who sacrificed his life in devotion to those of his friends who had been seized with cholera.' Though 'every way superior to his brother as a man,' he was, says the same writer, 'his inferior as an artist' ... 'the difference in the instant apprehension of form and manipulative power in the two brothers was very remarkable. The composition of the one was hard, piecemeal, and disjointed, while the modelling of the other was rapid, certain, soft, and accurate.' Against this critique may be set the remark of Richard Redgrave: 'He was original in his art and of much promise.' ...|$|E

Multiple optima are possible, with anarchy a local optimum, perfect enforcement a local minimum and imperfect enforcement a global optimum.

40|$|In {{much of his}} poetry, {{and from}} {{an early stage of}} his career, Wordsworth aims to resist the power of money, to {{repudiate}} it for its social and moral inefficacy. However, the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>repudiation</b> involves an acknowledgement of money’s power: in order to resist money, an alternative must be ‘coined’. This thesis will show the way in which Wordsworth consistently attempts to deal with money in his work, not only as an imaginative theme, but also as an everyday reality, and that his remarkable sensitivity to such matters ensures that economic ideas infiltrate many of the significant aspects of his poetic. In my introductory chapter, I bring together two poems that seem to represent successive stages in Wordsworth’s confrontation and rejection of worldly economics, ‘Tintern Abbey’ and Home at Grasmere. I contrast the first poem’s hesitant attempt to inaugurate a version of economic community with the second poem’s apparent fulfilment of this aspiration. In chapter two, I examine the juvenile poem The Vale of Esthwaite and the early publication An Evening Walk, in order to suggest some reasons for the economic preoccupation that I find at the core of Wordsworth’s poetic. The German trip of 1798 - 99 is the subject of chapter three, and, through some relatively neglected verse that Wordsworth composed during this period, I demonstrate the connection that he made between economic and poetic crises, and ask how far each was resolved. I find a tension between the economic and gift themes in Wordsworth’s poetry, and in chapter four I examine this problem in detail, via The Prelude, in which both feature prominently. In doing so, I will reveal the fundamentally economic ideas on which Wordsworth’s self-image as poet rests. As a response to the avowedly ‘experimental’ character of Lyrical Ballads, in chapter five I attempt my own experimental reading of the ‘Preface’ in which Wordsworth sought to explain the principles of these poems. I show the way in which Wordsworth’s account of the value of poetry closely reflects arguments made by John Locke over a hundred years earlier to explain the value of money. I also suggest some historical reasons for this broad similarity. In the second part of chapter five, I trace economic subtexts in the ‘Essay Supplementary to the Preface’ (1815). I suggest that although developments in the public sphere may have prompted Wordsworth’s arguments in the ‘Preface’, a more private kind of economic sensitivity forms the background to the ‘Essay’. In my final chapter, I consider the significance of the mansion in Wordsworth’s poetry, an image which is not only instrumental {{in the development of the}} theme of imaginative wealth, but becomes the primary figure by which it is articulated. In the first part of this chapter I trace the development of this image in Wordsworth’s early verse; in the second part of the chapter I consider its meanings in Wordsworth’s mature verse, through complementary readings of The Ruined Cottage and ‘Tintern Abbey’, and a brief rereading of The Prelude...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{problems}} {{that arise in}} forensic document examination, are usually quite {{different from that of}} traditional writer identification and verification tasks, where the data is assumed to be natural handwriting. However, in case of forensic documents no such assumption can be made about data. This give rise of prob-lems <b>of</b> forgery and <b>repudiation</b> detection. The problem of forgery detection has been studied in the context of signature verification. The second problem, repudi-ation, arise where a writer deliberately distorts his handwriting in order to avoid identification. Moreover, in case of forensic documents, we often have to arrive at a decision based on a single document pair. Since the problem <b>of</b> <b>repudiation</b> is inherently different from that of writer identification or verification, the optimal way to handle them needs to be different. This paper addresses the problem <b>of</b> <b>repudiation</b> in generic handwritten documents, and also proposes a framework to analyze such documents. The approach can further be extended for detection of forgeries as well. ...|$|R
