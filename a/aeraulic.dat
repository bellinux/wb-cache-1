This behav- iour is proper only for free-vortex flow, whereas radial fluid migration along the span is always present in case of controlled vortex design blades. The paper presents a design procedure to increase <b>aeraulic</b> efficiency of fan rotors originally designed using a controlled vortex criterion, {{based on the assumption that}} a blade section positioning taking into account the actual airflow direction could be beneficial for rotor <b>aeraulic</b> performance. The proposed procedure employs a three-dimensional aerofoil positioning and blade forward sweep. The procedure is applied to a rotor-only tube-axial fan featuring a 0. 44 hub-to-tip ratio, an almost constant swirl velocity distribution at the rotor outlet and a quite low blade Reynolds number. Rotor prototypes deriving from step-by-step blade modifications are experimentally tested on an ISO 5801 standard test rig.

Its application to outdoor <b>aeraulic</b> studies is promising, e. g. applied on complex urban configurations, as an alternative approach to the commonplace Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes and large eddy simulation methods based on the Navier-Stokes equations. Emerging many-core devices, such as graphic processing units (GPUs), nowadays make possible to run very large scale simulations on rather inexpensive hardware. In this paper, we present simulation results obtained using our multi-GPU LBM solver.

40|$|Optimization {{and control}} of {{displacement}} ventilation systems in buildings require accurate modeling of <b>aeraulic</b> and thermal phenomena involved in the establishment or the destruction of thermal stratification in the room. We carried out an analysis and developed global models {{on the basis of}} data from the Poitiers "Laboratoire d’Etudes Thermiques" experimental facility (see Figure° 2). The goal is to provide tools accurate enough to describe the thermal comfort implied by such systems but of easier use than CFD codes [3]. We propose two types of simplified models for evaluation of the temperature in the room. They are called zonal model and one-dimensional model and have been presented in a previous paper [5]. After briefly coming back on their description we compare calculations and experimental data in terms of temperature field. We then focus on the plume representation.

40|$|Tube-axial {{fans are}} widely used in {{industrial}} applications because of their compactness, simplicity, and low cost. However, the achievable fan pressure rise is generally penalised {{by the absence of}} a straightener and diffuser, and the consequent waste of tangential and axial dynamic pressures at the fan outlet. The corresponding fan efficiency drop might not comply with stringent regulations like the European Directive for energy-related products. Thus, operation ranges of high efficiency need to be clearly defined in the preliminary design phase, especially when constraints on maximum size and/or rotational speed are imposed. This paper proposes analytical formulas and charts to evaluate the efficiency of the tube-axial fan configuration (with or without tail-cone diffuser) when constraints on fan size and/or speed are additional design requirements. The analytical formulas and charts have been validated against experimental data. On this basis, a preliminary design criterion is suggested for high-efficiency tube-axial fans featuring arbitrary vortex design blades of constant swirl type. The criterion is used to design a 315 mm low-to-medium pressure tube-axial fan that is able to operate at a constant <b>aeraulic</b> efficiency peak of approximately 0. 6 for blade positioning angles in the range 20 ° to 30 °...|$|E
40|$|A {{bioclimatic}} {{approach to}} designing comfortable buildings in {{hot and humid}} tropical regions requires, firstly, some preliminary, important work on the building envelope to limit the energy contributions, and secondly, an airflow optimization of the building. For the first step, tools such as nodal or zonal models have been largely implemented. For the second step, the assessment of air velocities, in three dimensions and in a large space, can only be performed {{through the use of}} detailed models such as with CFD. This paper deals with the improvement of thermal comfort by ventilating around the occupants. For this purpose, the average velocity coefficient definition is modified to be adapted to CFD and the areas involving movement or the living spaces. We propose a new approach based on the derivation of a new quantity: the well-ventilated percentage of a living space. The well-ventilated percentage of a space allows a time analysis of the <b>aeraulic</b> behaviour of the building in its environment. These percentages can be over a period such as one day, a season or a year.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} a new pressure drop model developed for cakes composed of nanostructured particles. The cake structure {{is understood as}} a tangle of chains composed by juxtaposed primary particles with (aggregates) or without (agglomerates) a partial overlap. Since cake porosity {{is one of the}} main parameters determining <b>aeraulic</b> resistance, an experiment protocol based on the changes in deposit thickness as a function of the cake mass per surface area has been developed to accurately determine this parameter. To this end, the pressure drop and the porosity of the cakes created by the filtration of carbon nanoparticles aggregates and agglomerates on PTFE membrane were measured. The aggregate and agglomerate count median mobility diameters range from 91 nm to 170 nm and from 48 nm to 62 nm, respectively. The associated Peclet numbers range from 0. 19 to 53 for filtration velocities of 0. 01, 0. 05 and 0. 09 m/s. Initial experimental results indicate that the porosity of the cakes ranges from 0. 94 to 0. 984 in correlation with the Peclet number of the aggregates or agglomerates.

40|$|Engineering {{students}} get separate courses on different topics. In the thermal and thermodynamic field this comprises e. g. Engineering Thermodynamics and Heat Transfer, with related courses such as Numerical Methods, Electrical Engineering and Control Theory. However, students {{find it difficult}} to see how these topics are interconnected and to have a clear view how this knowledge is applied in their working career. For this reason a new student project (4 credits) was set up on the design of a ground coupled heat pump system for an office building. The process of going through all design steps of this typical engineering job, and hereby relating every step to the corresponding theory, allows to link theory with a real life example and demonstrate how course topics interact. The goal was to use hand methods not requiring specific software, which forced students to program the related equations in a python notebook, instead of just filling in numbers. Defining boundary conditions, calculating heating and cooling load, estimating a load duration curve, defining base and peak load emission systems, designing the hydraulic and <b>aeraulic</b> distribution system layout and sizing a ground coupled heat pump with direct cooling were required steps in order to finalize the design. This project proved very useful to apply theory touching topics as steady-state and transient heat transfer, heat exchangers, thermodynamic cycles, psychrometry, dynamic system analysis and system simulation.

40|$|Publicación ISIThis paper compares and {{discusses}} {{the efficiency of}} various air curtains designed to ultimately operate a bilateral <b>aeraulic</b> confinement of a short section of a tunnel or corridor-like geometry. The tested arrangements include single- and twin-jet air curtain systems with and without air return ducts. Jet opening ratios equal to 10 and 20 are considered, with air discharge velocities ranging from I to 10 m/s. The facility and the experimental approach used in this work are described and justified in many details. Results are presented in terms of leakage flow rates. Information is also provided about relevant air change rates and system time constants. The global efficiency of an air curtain is greatly improved by the adjunction of an air recirculation circuit due to enhanced system stability. A critical jet exit velocity corresponding to transition from the laminar to the turbulent regime of the channel flow inside the air curtain diffuser was found. For discharge velocities larger than this critical velocity an asymptotic behaviour is observed for every air curtain tested. At the lower nozzle exit velocities, the non-recirculated twin-jet system exhibits a weird behaviour. Unexpectedly, {{the results show that}} a single jet with a given opening ratio may perform better than a twin-jet of same height with a lower opening ratio. However, the results show that the performance of an air curtain is much dependant of the conditions under which this air curtain is operated demonstrating therefore that great care should be exercised in any attempt of comparison.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the IEA 40 {{research}} project, a specification of a ?Functional Test Procedure? was progressively developed using the CA-MET building in Namur as real size test bench for the application and validation of the procedure. The target system is a typical VAV system devoted to the ventilation, cooling and air conditioning functions. The procedure consists in a series of operations to be applied to the system, considered as a set of connected components and taking into account the following constraints: 1) time availability 2) intrinsic limitations of the system 3) reference performances. The proposed procedure is divided in two sets of actions: 1) a number of preliminary actions allowing to take the best benefit of the subsequent phases: a) identification of available measurement points b) identification of actuators characteristics c) identification of control strategies d) <b>aeraulic</b> network calculations e) selection of measurement techniques and experimental design 2) the verification tasks themselves: The philosophy of the verification process is to bring the system into a number of states which allowed each specific check to be carried out.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} was to {{validate}} the use of outdoor-indoor volumetric impaction sampler with Hirst-type spore traps (HTSTs) to continuously monitor fungal load {{in order to prevent}} invasive fungal infections during major structural work in hospital settings. For 4 weeks, outdoor fungal loads were quantified continuously by 3 HTSTs. Indoor air was sampled by both HTST and viable impaction sampler. Results were expressed as particles/m 3 (HTST) or colony-forming units (CFU) /m 3 (biocollector). Paired comparisons by day were made with Wilcoxon's paired signed-rank test or paired Student's t-test as appropriate. Paired airborne spore levels were correlated 2 by 2, after log-transformation with Pearson's cross-correlation. Concordance was calculated with kappa coefficient (κ). Median total fungal loads (TFLs) sampled by the 3 outdoor HTSTs were 3, 025. 0, 3, 287. 5 and 3, 625. 0 particles/m 3 (P = 0. 6, 0. 6 and 0. 3). -Concordance between Aspergillaceae fungal loads (AFLs, including Aspergillus spp. + Penicillium spp.) was low (κ = 0. 2). A low positive correlation was found between TFLs sampled with outdoor HTST and indoor HTST with applying a 4 -hour time lag, r = 0. 30, 95 % CI (0. 23 - 0. 43), P< 0. 001. In indoor air, Aspergillus spp. were detected by the viable impaction sampler on 63. 1 % of the samples, whereas AFLs were found by HTST-I on only 3. 6 % of the samples. Concordance between Aspergillus spp. loads and AFLs sampled with the 2 methods was very low (κ = 0. 1). This study showed a 4 -hour time lag between increase of outdoor and indoor TFLs, possibly due to insulation and <b>aeraulic</b> flow of the building. Outdoor HTSTs may permit to quickly identify (after 48 hours) time periods with high outdoor fungal loads. An identified drawback is that a too low sample area read did not seem to enable detection of Aspergillaceae spores efficiently. Indoor HTSTs may not be recommended at this time, and outdoor HTSTs need further study. Air sampling by viable impaction sampler remains the reference tool for quantifying fungal contamination of indoor air in hospitals...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLow energy buildings, being highly insulated, {{are subject}} to {{important}} overheating risks. Thermal simulation as well as experimental studies have shown the large potential of ventilative cooling. One barrier against this approach is the difficulty of evaluating air flows. Appropriate calculation methods and characterization of openings are needed, so that these systems {{can be dealt with}} in design, regulation and certification tools. The present study is based upon the monitoring of a 135 m 2 zero energy house situated near Paris. Temperature profiles have been measured when varying the ventilation pattern, i. e. opening or closing vertical windows, roof windows and internal doors. A dynamic thermal simulation tool is used to evaluate temperature profiles in the house under the climatic conditions corresponding to on site measurements (external temperature and solar radiation). The model accounts for the conductive, radiative and convective heat transfer, as well as energy storage in the building envelope related to solar and internal gains. In this highly insulated new construction, the most uncertain parameter is the natural ventilation flow rate. This parameter, and the related <b>aeraulic</b> characteristics of the openings, can be calibrated by minimizing the discrepancy between calculated and measured temperature profiles. Given the small window height, and the large height between ground floor and roof windows, a one way flow model is considered. The roof window characteristics will also be evaluated in a laboratory benchmark. A cell (3 m x 3 m x 2 m) is divided into two compartments by a slanting wall including the window. A ventilator blows air into one space and the pressure difference is measured between both sides of the window. Varying the air flow rate allows a relationship between the flow rate and the pressure difference to be identified. This relationship may depend on the pressure difference between both sides of the openings, therefore calibration using on site measurement is helpful. The air exchange rate estimated by this method will be compared to measurements using tracer gas, performed in the house {{as well as in the}} laboratory benchmark. The possibility to use anemometers will also be tested. The method proposed here, combining a benchmark in a laboratory with numerical simulation and on site monitoring may bring a supplementary input, complementing the existing knowledge in the field of passive cooling of buildings. The feasibility of using this method in order to prepare appropriate input data for numerical models implemented in regulation, design and certification tools will be studied...|$|E
