40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{current trends}} in seafloor mapping data acquisition using multibeam echo sounders, presents a general procedure of processing both bathymetry and sonar data, and indicates some {{new directions for}} ocean mapping in the future. It also describes {{a state of the}} art in Korea in post-processing and visualizing multibeam bathymetry and sonar data for the purpose of developing ocean mapping systems. In particular, an algorithm of enhancing multibeam sonar data is proposed and the experimental result is demonstrated. I. Introduction Since a practical echo sounding machine was commercialized by the firm of Kelvin-Hughes in the late 1920 s, advances in ocean mapping technology have been led by military communities due to the strategic importance of submarines, ocean mines, and inertial navigation. During the last two decades, there have been developed a number of <b>acoustic</b> <b>swath</b> imaging and bathymetric mapping systems such as multibeam echo sounding systems and long-range si [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Recognition {{of marine}} debris {{represent}} {{a difficult task}} due to the extreme variability of the marine environment, the possible targets, and the variable skill levels of human operators. The range of potential targets is much wider than similar fields of research such as mine hunting, localization of unexploded ordnance or pipeline detection. In order to address this additional complexity, an adaptive algorithm is being developing that appropriately responds {{to changes in the}} environment, and context. The preliminary step is to properly geometrically and radiometrically correct the collected data. Then, the core engine manages the fusion of a set of statistically- and physically-based algorithms, working at different levels (<b>swath,</b> <b>beam,</b> snippet, and pixel) and using both predictive modeling (that is, a high-frequency acoustic backscatter model) and phenomenological (e. g., digital image processing techniques) approaches. The expected outcome is the reduction of inter-algorithmic cross-correlation and, thus, the probability of false alarm. At this early stage, we provide a proof of concept showing outcomes from algorithms that dynamically adapt themselves to the depth and average backscatter level met in the surveyed environment, targeting marine debris (modeled as objects of about 1 -m size). The project relies on a modular software library, called Matador (Marine Target Detection and Object Recognition) ...|$|R

For ice and oceanographic applications there is a demand for even larger coverage. This paper describes {{the development of the}} new recently implemented and released WideScanSAR mode with swath widths between 190 km and 260 km, depending on the varying incidence angles.

40|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>swath</b> mapping and {{sediment}} box coring {{conducted on the}} continental shelf {{near the mouth of}} the Eel River revealed regional variations in acoustic backscatter that can be related to the shelf sedimentology. The acoustic-backscatter variations observed on the shelf were unusually narrow compared to the response of similar sediment types documented in other areas. However, the acoustic data revealed four principal bottom types on the shelf that can be related to sedimentologic differences observed in cores. The four areas are: (1) low acoustic backscatter associated with the nearshore-sand facies and the prodelta terraces of the Eel and Mad rivers, composed of fine sands and coarse silts with low porosity; (2) high acoustic backscatter associated with fine silts characterized by high porosity and deposited by the 1995 flood of the Eel River; (3) intermediate acoustic backscatter in the outer-shelf muds, where clayey silts are accumulating and the 1995 flood apparently had limited direct effect; and (4) intermediate acoustic backscatter near the fringes of the 1995 flood deposits and in areas where the flood sediments were more disrupted by post-depositional processes. The highest acoustic backscatter was identified in areas where the 1995 flood sediments remained relatively intact and near the shelf surface into the summer of 1995. Cores collected from these areas contained wavy or lenticular bedding. The rapid deposition of the high-porosity muddy layers results in better preservation of incorporated ripple forms than in areas less directly impacted by the flood deposit. The high-porosity muddy layers allow acoustic penetration into the sediments and result in greater acoustic backscatter from incorporated roughness elements...|$|R
40|$|Changes in benthic {{habitats}} {{occur as}} a result of natural variation or human-induced processes. It is important to understand natural fine-scale inter-annual patterns of change to separate these signals from patterns of long-term change. Describing change from an acoustic remote sensing standpoint has been facilitated by the recent availability of full coverage <b>swath</b> <b>acoustic</b> datasets, but is limited by cost pressures associated with multiple surveys of the same area. We studied the use of landscape transition analysis as a means to differentiate seemingly random patterns of habitat change from systematic signals of habitat transition at a shallow (10 to 50 m depth) 18 km 2 site on the temperate Australian continental shelf in 2006 and 2007. Supervised classifications for each year were accomplished using inde pendently collected highresolution <b>swath</b> <b>acoustic</b> and video reference data. Of the 4 representative biotic clas ses considered, signals of directional systematic changes occurred be tween a kelp-dominated class, a sessile invertebrate-dominated class and a mixed class of kelp and sessile invertebrates. We provide a detailed analysis of the components of the traditional change detection cross tabulation matrix, allowing identification of the strongest signals of systematic habitat transitions. Iden tifying patterns of habitat change is an important first step toward understanding the processes that drive them...|$|R
40|$|A 240 kHz multibeam sonar was {{deployed}} on a sub‐surface mooring {{in order}} to collect acousticbackscatter measurements from the bubbles in a ships wake in August, 2002. The sonar was located {{at a depth of}} 30 m and oriented so that its <b>swath</b> of <b>beams</b> was orthogonal to the shipstrack. Measurements proportional to the acoustic scattering cross‐section per unit volume were made and used to estimate the vertical turbulent diffusion coefficient in the ships wake using the same methodology that Thorpe used with a single‐beam echosounder underneath breakingwaves [J. Phys. Ocean. 14, 855 – 863 (1984) ]. The wake was viewed as a distributed source of bubbles that are transported downward from the surface by turbulence. A steady state representation of the bubble field was used, where it was assumed that the bubble population exponentially decayed with depth, and that a bubble conservation equation could be written that only accounted for turbulent diffusion, buoyancy, and gas dissolution. Estimates of the verticalturbulent diffusion coefficient {{in the wake of a}} research vessel will be presented. [Work supported by ONR Code 321 US.

The Solitary Islands Marine Park (SIMP), covering 720 km 2 of coastal waters in New South Wales, Australia, includes reef and unconsolidated habitats up to 17 km from shore and 75 m depth. When established in 1991, there was limited knowledge of biotic patterns, seafloor habitats and habitat-biotic {{relationships in the}} multiple-use SIMP, which constrained effective conservation planning. Subsequent mapping of sub-tidal habitats from aerial photography and single-beam acoustics improved habitat representation following rezoning in 2002 using Comprehensive, Adequate, Representative (CAR) principles and assisted site selection for diver surveys of fishes, a key surrogate taxon.

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} to apply multi-temporal Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ENVISAT/ASAR, C-Band) images to snow cover monitoring and mapping in mountainous areas. A multi-temporal dataset that includes sequences of ascending and descending ASAR wide <b>swath</b> and <b>beam</b> mode IS 2 scenes acquired over Switzerland was investigated. The images were geometrically corrected to remove relief distortions, producing geocoded terrain corrected (GTC) image products. Backscattering coefficients (Beta, Sigma and Gamma nought) are typically calculated using a nominal local incidence angle value using a simplified ellipsoid geometry. We apply a more rigorous approach that models the backscattering coefficients normalised for local illuminated area (projected into the look direction for γ ° retrieval), producing radiometric terrain corrected (RTC) image products. The snow cover was monitored by calculating {{the difference between the}} backscattering coefficients (γ°) of each ASAR image and the reference backscattering coefficient of a synthetic dry snow or snow free image. Similar to conventional fixed thresholding (e. g. 3 dB), a reference winter dry snow image was compared to each new ASAR image. Analysis of the resulting time series shows strong seasonal trends in backscatter behaviour, likely caused by variations of liquid water content in the snow cover. Meteorological data (MeteoSchweiz), NOAA images and snow cover maps from the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research supported interpretation and validation of the results...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method for objectively characterizing a swath of {{digitally}} sampled seafloor topography. Our method analyzes the distribution of surface slopes by compiling surface-normal vectors into a two-dimensional histogram using an equal-area projection. The direction of maximum variance (first principal axis) of the histogram is {{used to determine the}} azimuth of lineations in the topography, and the variance is used as a measure of seafloor roughness. We apply the method to short sections of Sea <b>Beam</b> <b>swath</b> data and find that the histogram parameters are effective in describing the behavior of the topography. In particular, similar patterns are observed for a sequence of histograms derived from data collected over the Mendocino and the Surveyor fracture zones in the northeast Pacific.

50|$|The ships {{original}} {{echo sounding}} equipment and Hydrographic Data Acquisition System (HDAS) {{consisted of a}} very early seagoing data processing system made up of two Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-9 computers that shared a central drum disk drive. KSR-35 TTYs were used as the primary system consoles and a Calcomp flatbed plotter kept a real-time track of the ships position. This equipment was all replaced in the mid 1970s by a new narrow <b>beam</b> <b>swath</b> system. The swath array, replacing the single beam system, was the Bottom Topography Survey Subsystem (BOTOSS) and the processing system, replacing HDAS, was the Bathymetric Survey System (BASS). The initial BOTOSS hull mounting was subject to air bubble interference so that a new arrangement on a fairing and foil mounted on the keel was required to house the array elements during a 1974-1975 period in a West Coast yard.|$|R
40|$|A lander-based hydroacoustic swath system, GasQuant, was {{deployed}} in an intensely bubbling seep {{area at the}} shelf west of the Crimea Peninsula, Black Sea. With its horizontally oriented <b>swath</b> (21 <b>beams,</b> 63 ° <b>swath</b> angle, 180 kHz) GasQuant operates in a sonar-like mode and monitors bubbles remotely, exploiting their strong backscattering when crossing the swath. All active seep spots were monitored simultaneously within the covered area (2075 m 2). Even applying simple processing and visualization techniques (moving average for filtering, FFT for spectrum analyses; swath and trace plots) identified 17 seeps of different activity patterns that have been grouped as follows: (1) sporadically active with one to a few long bursts (up to 18 min) or randomly occurring short bursts (350 bursts or > 20 % active). Studying the bubble release variability of single seeps and of the entire area allows speculation about the external and internal processes that modulate the bubble release. In the study area none of the 17 seeps {{was found to be}} permanently active. Only one was active for 75 % and another one for 45 % of the time monitored. The rest only released bubbles during less than 20 % of the time with an overall average of only 12 %. This would have strong implications for flux extrapolations if these were based on very accurate but few short-term measurements. Both strong overestimates and underestimates are possible. High-resolution monitoring over at least one tidal cycle as with the GasQuant system might help {{to get an idea of}} the temporal variability. Thus flux extrapolations can be corrected to better reflect the real seep activity...|$|R
40|$|On the {{continental}} shelf off the Ciento peninsula (eastern Tyrrhenian Sea) {{the occurrence of}} more than 13 km(2) of maerl beds was documented through <b>acoustic</b> surveys. <b>Swath</b> bathymetric data along with a dense grid of chirp-sonar profiles were acquired over more than 180 km(2). The maerl facies was characterized {{on the basis of}} the components analysis of 32 grab samples collected at selected sites. Mapped maerl-beds are predominant on submerged terraces located at variable water depth (wd) between 42 and 52 m. This preferred distribution on submerged terraces is probably associated with relatively vigorous bottom currents generated by local circulation that hinders the deposition of terrigenous sediments. Calcareous red algae result to be the most important producers of carbonates from 40 down to 60 m wd. We calculated the coralline carbonate accumulation from the percentage cover of coralline algae (thin section mapping) x 1 cm-thick layer of sediment x measured coralline density. The total coralline cover (living plus dead) in the Cilento area is 13. 96 km(2), with a total 316 800 tons of algal carbonate in the surface 1 cm layer, that correspond to 20 430 g m(- 2). Living maerl is recorded at a depth of 47 m, with a live coralline cover of about 40 % over a minimum area of about 1. 2 km(2). This live maerl has a thickness of about 1 cm and is composed mainly of unattached branches of Lithothamnion corallioides (P. L. Crouan & H. M. Crouan) P. L. Crouan & H. M. Crouan, 1867. The molluscan association of the maerl bed is dominated by characteristic species of the Coastal Detritic Biocoenosis. The production of carbonate by living coralline algae has been calculated as weight of live corallines in 1 cm-thick layer x 100 y(- 1) x total area(- 1) and corresponds to 90. 8 g m(- 2) y(- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|NASA's Earth observing Soil Moisture Active & Passive (SMAP) Mission is {{scheduled}} to launch in November 2014 into a 685 km near-polar, sun synchronous orbit. SMAP will provide comprehensive global mapping measurements of soil moisture and freeze/thaw state {{in order to enhance}} understanding of the processes that link the water, energy, and carbon cycles. The primary objectives of SMAP are to improve worldwide weather and flood forecasting, enhance climate prediction, and refine drought and agriculture monitoring during its 3 year mission. The SMAP instrument architecture incorporates an L-band radar and an L-band radiometer which share a common feed horn and parabolic mesh reflector. The instrument rotates about the nadir axis at approximately 15 rpm, thereby providing a conically scanning wide <b>swath</b> antenna <b>beam</b> that is capable of achieving global coverage within 3 days. In order to make the necessary precise surface emission measurements from space, a temperature knowledge of 60 deg C for the mesh reflector is required. In order to show compliance, a thermal vacuum test was conducted using a portable solar simulator to illuminate a non flight, but flight-like test article through the quartz window of the vacuum chamber. The molybdenum wire of the antenna mesh is too fine to accommodate thermal sensors for direct temperature measurements. Instead, the mesh temperature was inferred from resistance measurements made during the test. The test article was rotated to five separate angles between 10 deg and 90 deg via chamber breaks to simulate the maximum expected on-orbit solar loading during the mission. The resistance measurements were converted to temperature via a resistance versus temperature calibration plot that was constructed from data collected in a separate calibration test. A simple thermal model of two different representations of the mesh (plate and torus) was created to correlate the mesh temperature predictions to within 60 deg C. The on-orbit mesh temperature will be predicted using the correlated analytical thermal model since direct measurements from in-situ flight thermal sensors are not possible...|$|R
40|$|NASA's SMAP Mission {{launched}} in January 2015 into a 685 km near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit. The SMAP instrument architecture incorporates an L-band radar and radiometer which {{share a common}} feedhorn and mesh reflector. The instrument rotates about the nadir axis at approximately 15 rpm, thereby providing a conically scanning wide <b>swath</b> antenna <b>beam</b> {{that is capable of}} achieving global coverage within three days. The radiometer and its associated electronics have tight thermal stability requirements {{in order to meet the}} required surface emittance measurement precision from space. Maintaining the thermal stabilities is quite challenging because the radiometer is located on a spinning platform that can either be in full sunlight or eclipse, and thus exposed to a highly transient environment. Stability requirements were met by integrating a light-weight Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) radome into the design to prevent solar illumination of the feed horn interior. The radome was painted white since the thermo-optical properties of bare sunlit EPS degrade rapidly over the three-year mission. Milling of the EPS and solvent within the white paint created cavities on the EPS surface which may introduce localized hot spots possibly violating the EPS glass transition temperature of 96 degC and leading to structural integrity concerns. A three-day thermal test was conducted in a vacuum chamber to verify survivability of the radome during a simulated non-spin fault condition at end of mission. A portable solar simulator illuminated the test article and the beam irradiance was kept nearly constant during the entire 50 hour test, except during the first hour which simulated the expected 79 degC on-orbit surface temperature of the radome. The test article survived based on the established pass criteria for three separate metrics: dimensional, optical property, and color. If any hot spots exist locally, they did not cause any observable permanent deformation when compared to pre- and post-test images. The test results increase confidence that there is a high probability that the radome will survive the worst-case scenario of a no-spin fault condition at the end of mission...|$|R
40|$|Unconsolidated sediments form {{extensive}} seafloor habitats worldwide, yet {{few studies}} have examined fish assemblage patterns in relation to specific sediment type or morphology. Baited remote underwater videos (BRUVs) were deployed at 3 sites (3 replicates per site) in the Solitary Islands Marine Park (SIMP), in each of 4 apparent ‘habitat types’ identified from <b>swath</b> <b>acoustic</b> mapping backscatter imagery and bathymetry. Habitat types ranged in reflected signal backscatter intensity: very dark, dark, light, very light. Additionally, apparent morphological features were associated with each (e. g. very dark = lens-shaped; light = sand waves). Sediments were characterised at each site by conducting granulometric analyses of samples collected using a van Veen grab. Both the darker ‘habitat types’ were found to be gravels and both lighter types were fine sands. There was a strong pattern in fish assemblage structure in relation to habitat type, and distinct assemblages were seen between ‘gravel’ and ‘fine sand’ habitats. Species richness was higher in gravel than in sand habitats. Additionally, 6 species were only recorded in the very dark lens habitat. However, there were no apparent differences in assemblage patterns between the 2 fine sand habitats. Of the different granulometric measures, fish assemblages were most strongly correlated with a combination of median grain size, % gravel and arithmetic sorting. The current habitat classification system for the SIMP includes habitat type (unconsolidated or hard substrata) as criteria for conservation planning. Further division of unconsolidated habitats into ‘gravel’ and ‘fine sand’ categories is needed to better represent biotic assemblages...|$|R
40|$|Marine spatial {{planning}} and conservation need underpinning with sufficiently detailed and accurate seabed substrate and habitat maps. Although multibeam echosounders {{enable us to}} map the seabed with high resolution and spatial accuracy, {{there is still a}} lack of fit-for-purpose seabed maps. This is due to the high costs involved in carrying out systematic seabed mapping programmes {{and the fact that the}} development of validated, repeatable, quantitative and objective methods of <b>swath</b> <b>acoustic</b> data interpretation is still in its infancy. We compared a wide spectrum of approaches including manual interpretation, geostatistics, object-based image analysis and machine-learning to gain further insights into the accuracy and comparability of acoustic data interpretation approaches based on multibeam echosounder data (bathymetry, backscatter and derivatives) and seabed samples with the aim to derive seabed substrate maps. Sample data were split into a training and validation data set to allow us to carry out an accuracy assessment. Overall thematic classification accuracy ranged from 67 %– 76 % and Cohen's kappa varied between 0. 34 and 0. 52. However, these differences were not statistically significant at the 5 % level. Misclassifications were mainly associated with uncommon classes, which were rarely sampled. Map outputs were between 68 % and 87 % identical. To improve classification accuracy in seabed mapping, we suggest that more studies on the effects of factors affecting the classification performance as well as comparative studies testing the performance of different approaches need to be carried out with a view to developing guidelines for selecting an appropriate method for a given dataset. In the meantime, classification accuracy might be improved by combining different techniques to hybrid approaches and multi-method ensembles...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{quantify}} change in marine benthic habitats {{must be considered}} a key goal of marine habitat mapping activities. Changes in distribution of distinct suites of benthic biological species may occur {{as a result of}} natural or human induced processes and these processes may operate at a range of temporal and spatial scales. It is important to understand natural small scale inter-annual patterns of change in order to separate these signals from potential patterns of longer term change. Work to describe these processes of change from an acoustic remote sensing stand point has thus far been limited due to the relatively recent availability of full coverage <b>swath</b> <b>acoustic</b> datasets and cost pressures associated with multiple surveys of the same area. This paper describes the use of landscape transition analysis as a means to differentiate seemingly random patterns of habitat change from systematic signals of habitat transition at a shallow (10 – 50 m depth) 18 km 2 study area on the temperate Australian continental shelf between the years 2006 and 2007. Supervised classifications for each year were accomplished using independently collected high resolution (3 m cell-size) multibeam echosounder (MBES) and video-derived reference data. Of the 4 representative biotic classes considered, signals of directional systematic changes were observed to occur between a shallow kelp dominated class, a deep sessile invertebrate dominated class and a mixed class of kelp and sessile invertebrates. These signals of change are interpreted as inter-annual variation in the density and depth related extent of canopy forming kelp species at the site, a phenomenon reported in smaller scale temporal studies of the same species. The methods applied in this study provide a detailed analysis of the various components of the traditional change detection cross tabulation matrix allowing identification of the strongest signals of systematic habitat transitions across broad geographical regions. Identifying clear patterns of habitat change is an important first step in linking these patterns to the processes that drive them. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Techniques of single- and {{multi-beam}} active acoustics and {{the passive}} recording of fish vocalisations {{were employed to}} evaluate the benefits and limitations of each technique as a method for assessing and monitoring fish aggregations. Five species, Samson fish (Seriola hippos), mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus), West Australian dhufish (Glaucosoma hebraicum), Bight redfish (Centroberyx gerrardi) and pink snapper (Pagrus auratus) were investigated {{on the basis of}} their abundance, ecological importance and differing behaviour. The primary focus was on S. hippos, a large nonvocal schooling fish, and A. japonicus, a large vocal fish, with each species forming aggregations for spawning purposes. Simrad EQ 60 single-beam echosounder assessments of mid-water, S. hippos aggregations at seven sites west of Rottnest Island illustrated the relative biomass increase, stabilisation and decrease between the months of October and March each year from October 2004 to March 2007. Surveys highlighted the preferred sites for spawning, spatial extents of each aggregation, as well as a decline in aggregation stability at full moon and end of season periods. Regular Department of Fisheries surveys displayed the relative ease with which single-beam techniques could be deployed, used and data analysed to monitor large, comparatively stable, deep (> 50 m) aggregations of large swimbladdered fish. Acquired acoustic data illustrated the limitations of single-beam surveys conducted on a mobile school of fish. RESON 8125 and 7125 multi-beam sonar (MBS) surveys of S. hippos at Rottnest Island locations, some conducted simultaneously with the Simrad EQ 60 single-beam, illustrated the improved spatial resolution of midwater targets achievable with MBS systems. The identification of individual S. hippos targets in MBS data facilitated the confirmation of S. hippos undetected by single-beam transects, due to relative sampling volumes. The MBS surveys showed evidence of possible fishing effects on S. hippos aggregations with school structure varying after a two hour period of fishing and video tows. Relative decline in aggregation stability towards the end of the season and possible avoidance behaviour from approaching vessels was observed as successive MBS transects, over a short space of time, recorded school movement around the wreck above which S. hippos aggregations sit. P. auratus spawning in the Cockburn Sound, Fremantle illustrated the limitations of single-beam acoustics to monitor aggregations of mobile fish in shallow water, due to vessel avoidance behaviour. Similar sampling issues were observed in MBS surveys despite the inherent geometric advantages of the wide <b>acoustic</b> <b>swath</b> and increased sample volume. It was anticipated that adjusting the MBS mounting position, such that nadir beams were orientated laterally athwartships (rather then vertically downwards), increased the lateral distance at which the fish could be observed, thus reducing vessel avoidance implications. However, due to time constraints and equipment availability, remounting the MBS was not possible at the time of survey and the effects of MBS orientation could not be verified. Single-beam and passive acoustic surveys of G. hebraicum illustrated the complexity of acoustic investigation of comparatively sedentary, demersal fish which often spawn in small groups. Discrimination of individuals using single-beam techniques was often restricted by the fish proximity to the seafloor and the footprint of the single-beam. Single-beam species identification of small groups of fish is impractical without simultaneous visual confirmation, due to the stochastic nature of fish reflectance. However, single-beam acoustics could provide information on G. hebraicum spawning related essential fish habitat using seafloor classification. While biological assessment of G. hebraicum otoliths, swimbladder and related muscular structure imply a soniferous species, as yet no vocal behaviour of any of the Glaucosomatidae has been reported, despite attempts here to detect vocalisations. Thus the characteristics of this species presented the greatest limitations for study using active or passive acoustic techniques. Passive acoustic techniques were shown to be ideally suited for monitoring the low density, benthic aggregations of A. japonicus in the Swan River. Spawning related vocalisations of A. japonicus were recorded in situ and in aquaria (Mosman Bay, Swan River and TAFE, Fremantle aquaculture centre respectively) each spawning season between October and May for four spawning seasons. A. japonicus calls, produced by the contraction of bi-lateral paired sonic muscles around the posterior two thirds of a heavily damped swimbladder, were classified into three categories relating to differing spawning functions. Category 1 calls (‘Bup’) of 2 - 4 swimbladder pulses were believed to function to gather males together in temporary broadcasting territories and to announce readiness to spawn. Category 2 calls comprised 11 - 32 pulses in a single audible tone (‘Baarp’), which could also be broken into two or more parts (‘Ba-Baarp’) with a believed function as a call of attraction, predominantly from males to females. The third Category comprised calls produced in quick succession at increasing call rate to a point of cessation. Series of Category 3 calls (‘Thup’) were recorded only at times associated with spawning, in fewer numbers than other call categories and consisted of between 1 and 4 pulses. Pulse repetition and spectral peak frequencies of Category 3 calls were notably higher than those of Category 1 and 2, both in situ and in aquaria, despite the similar number of pulses. For example, in situ pulse repetition frequencies of up to 114 Hz for Category 3 calls compared with approximately 59 Hz for other categories. It is suggested that the increased pulse repetition frequencies of Category 3 calls require greater, unsustainable levels of energy (corroborated by the decreasing pulse rate as these calls progress) and such calls are therefore reserved for specific, uncommon events, possibly episodes of courtship. Ground truth in aquaria calls exhibited similar call structure to those recorded in situ, however, pulse repetition rates and occurrence were significantly lower (respective pulse repetition frequencies of 41. 74 and 58. 68 Hz for captive and in situ Category 2 calls). Season-long monitoring of sound production in Mosman Bay determined spawning commencement was correlated with a daytime water temperature threshold at, or above 18. 5 °C, occurring between October and November. Generalized Additive Models showed sound pressure levels (SPLs) and, by proxy spawning throughout the season, were correlated with temperature, salinity, sunset and tidal effects with decreasing order of effect. Increases in short-term sound production were observed on a semi-lunar basis, occurring at the new and full moons. Local chorus level maxima were found to occur on a 3. 97 day basis (s. d. = 1. 8), similar to that found from egg collection in aquaria and previous in situ SPLs in local studies of A. japonicus. Comparisons between Mosman Bay tidal related afternoon/evening activity and nocturnal behaviour of alternative populations in captivity suggest that A. japonicus exhibits adaptive vocal behaviour, and by proxy spawning activities, dependent on environmental variables. Individual A. japonicus were localised during spawning within and close to an array of hydrophones by using vocalisation arrival-time differences, surface reflection and comparative energy level techniques to analyse vocalisations. Several individual A. japonicus were followed for periods ranging from seconds to several minutes as they called repetitively. Monitoring individual movement and separation distances between calling fish confirmed low mobility over long periods, indicative of lekking behaviour. The determination of call source levels employed calls of known range using data from the localisation study. Mean squared pressure source levels and 95 % confidence limits of the three call categories were measured as: 163 (147. 7, 178. 6), 172 (168. 4, 176. 0) and 157 (154. 0, 160. 3) dB re 1 μPa for Categories 1, 2 and 3, respectively. During periods of low density calling in the 2006 - 7 spawning season, techniques of call counting produced absolute abundance estimates for A. japonicus present within the hydrophone detection range of approximately 500 m, observing a maximum of 15 calling individuals. Assuming a 1. 3 : 1 sex ratio this implies a detectable spawning population of 26 fish within approximately 100, 000 m[superscript] 2 (range restricted across stream by depth) equivalent to approximately 3, 850 m[superscript] 2 per fish (assuming a random distribution of callers and recipients). However, during high density ‘continuous chorus’ calling the maximum number of callers able to be discerned using call counting techniques was exceeded. The application of call counting techniques and call contributions to overall SPLs to estimate biomass during ‘chorus’ calling, where calls merge together, requires further investigation. Recorded chorus levels were not a simple function of animals calling within the receiver proximity, but were strongly influenced by source-receiver range. A preliminary model to estimate minimum numbers of callers within derived range boundaries has been laid out. Recording of A. japonicus vocalisations illustrated the developing capabilities of passive acoustics to monitor soniferous fish species. A suggested set of protocols has been laid out to standardise the reporting of fish calls together with supplementary data relating environmental variables to their subsequent effects on the acoustic characteristics of the call. Standardisation of reporting will facilitate future spatial and temporal comparison of inter- and intra-species sound production. This study has illustrated that the features of each acoustic technique endear them to particular species-specific characteristics. For example, although S. hippos did not vocalise they formed midwater aggregations of large fish (107 cm mean fork length) and were thus amenable to active acoustic monitoring. In contrast, A. japonicus form low density, benthic aggregations and hence are not suited to study by active acoustics, but vocalised profusely rendering them suitable for passive acoustic monitoring. In many cases a combination of techniques both acoustic and non-acoustic is required to monitor the particular species, in order to ground truth the data...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic Doppler current {{profilers}} (ADCPs) {{were used}} to measure water velocities in the tailrace at John Day Dam over a two-week period in February 2005. Data were collected by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for the Hydraulic Design Section, Portland District, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The objective of this project was therefore to collect field measurements of water velocities in the near-field draft tube exit zone {{as well as the}} far-field tailrace to be used for improving these models. Field data were collected during the project using five separate ADCPs. Mobile ADCP data were collected using two ADCPs mounted on two separate boats. Data were collected by either holding the boat on-station at pre-defined locations for approximately 10 minutes or in moving transect mode when the boat would move over large distances during the data collection. Results from the mobile ADCP survey indicated a complex hydrodynamic flow field in the tailrace downstream of John Day Dam. A large gyre was noted between the skeleton section of the powerhouse and non-spilling portion of the spillway. Downstream of the spillway, the spillway flow is constrained against the navigation lock guide wall, and large velocities were noted in this region. Downstream of the guide wall, velocities decreased as the spillway jet dispersed. Near the tailrace island, the flow split was measured to be approximately equal on Day 2 (25. 4 kcfs spillway/ 123 kcfs total). However, approximately 60 % of the flow passed along the south shore of the island on Day 1 (15. 0 kcfs spillway/ 150 kcfs total). At a distance of 9000 ft downstream of the dam, flows had equalized laterally and were generally uniform over the cross section. The collection of water velocities near the draft tube exit of an operating turbine unit is not routine, and equipment capable of measuring 3 D water velocities in these zones are at the forefront of hydraulic measurement technology. Although the feasibility of measuring 1 D water velocity magnitudes has been previously demonstrated by the authors, the feasibility of resolving 3 D water velocity vectors given the heterogeneity of the flow field was unknown before this study’s data were collected. Both the 1 D and 3 D data were collected by deploying three ADCPs on dual-axis rotators directly above the draft tube exit of Turbine Unit 16. These instruments collected 1 D data during both the mobile reconnaissance campaign and a later one-week period with zero spillway discharge. During the zero spillway discharge period, Turbine Unit 16 was operated over a range of discharges. Approximately 12 hours of 1 D velocity data were collected at low (12 kcfs), middle (16. 2 kcfs), and high (19. 2 kcfs) turbine discharges. The 1 D dataset indicates large differences in flow patterns and RMS velocity fluctuations among the various discharge levels. Results from this project show that it is technically feasible to measure 3 D water velocities directly downstream of an operating turbine unit using a narrow <b>beam</b> <b>swath</b> (i. e., 6 -degree) ADCP. Data products from these 3 D velocity data include a measurement of the draft tube barrel flow distribution (a. k. a., the flow split), directional changes and the general decay of velocity as flow exits the draft tube and enters the tailrace, and a relative measure of the homogeneity of the flow field...|$|R
