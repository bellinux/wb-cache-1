40|$|ENGLISH] The {{study of}} <b>archivistics</b> has become {{important}} in contemporary culture, {{but it is}} anteceded by a long evolutionary process in which it goes from practice to scientific discipline. This paper reflects on the object of study of <b>archivistics,</b> its theoretical evolution, its educational tradition, its differences and similarities with other disciplines, {{and the impact of}} information and communication technologies (ICT) on both its theoretical and methodological foundations and on the education of professionals. The analysis of the development of <b>archivistics</b> as a discipline in progress should contribute to replace the widely spread mechanical and functional explanations, which have hindered its academic recognition. The paper concludes stating that <b>archivistics</b> has maintained its theoretical principles, although affected by the incorporation of information and communication technologies. Also, it asserts that documentation managing -including classification, ordering, description and conservationis still guided by the principle of provenance in its two dimensions: the respect for the fonds and the respect for the original order. Besides, it is still concerned with the preservation of documentary patrimony...|$|E
40|$|The {{dominant}} {{paradigm in}} <b>Archivistics,</b> called historical-tech-nicist, which arose after the French Revolution and evolved during the XIX and the XX centuries, {{is put in}} confrontation with a new one - the scientific-informational - which emerges into {{the context of the}} Information Society. In the light of this new perspective, <b>Archivistics</b> is understood as an applied branch of Information Science, with a clear object of study - the archives as an information system - and a scien-tific method of research, that operates by quadripolar dynamics and includes quantitative and qualitative approaches...|$|E
40|$|Archivistic {{research}} is taking {{momentum in the}} region due to the new contexts in Latin American societies thriving to become information and knowledge societies. Accordingly the “information, knowledge and society research group” in the Universidad de Antioquia Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecología has configurated the “Archives, Memory and Society” line to study archives and their possible relationships with society as means opening discussion and debate spaces leading to common interdisciplinary and research routes. This article present {{the results of the}} second stage of the “State of art in <b>Archivistics</b> and archives: Latin America 2000 - 2009 ”, comprising the search, selection and systematization of the <b>Archivistics</b> and archives scientific output in that period.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results derived from the documentary analysis carried out on the publications and normative texts of the Colombian <b>archivistics</b> from 1989 to 2008. Using a descriptive and documentary approach, a qualitative research was carried out on the bibliographic production and work of the National General Archive, the Archive of Bogotá, the University of Caldas, the University of Quindío, the University of La Salle and the archivistic norms in force in Colombia. The objective was to study the terms with higher and lower frequency of occurrence, the distribution of items per publication, {{the total number of}} terms placed in 21 letters of the alphabet and the words with the highest indexes of occurrence by master unit. Finally, stress was made on the importance of lexicometrical and terminological studies for the Colombian <b>archivistics</b> and the main problems underlying the lexicon: ambiguity, polysemy, indiscriminate use of terms coming from foreign languages and the creation of neologisms that violate morphosyntactic patterns...|$|E
40|$|The {{information}} {{representation in the}} archives framework faces new challenges characterized by the paradigmatic transitions in the <b>Archivistics.</b> The thinking raised by the post-custodial theory changed the theoretical and practical ways of the description process, now directed to represent in a standardized way different archival entities: documents, producers, functions, custodial institutions among others. The aim {{of this article is}} to study the standardized representation of <b>archivistics</b> producers and the creation of the authority registries. The present study is mostly exploratory-descriptive; it offers a theoretical analysis about the description of the producer entity and sub-entity institution, person and family. Also, the study analyses some general notions of authority record, access points and authority control. Finally, it introduces the international, national and regional standards published for the creation of archival authority registries. The representation of producers and their integration in the information systems is a main task in the new contexts of the postmodern archive, focussed on the management, access and accuracy of the information...|$|E

In the first place, some general ideas about the project, its objectives, methodology and state of the art approaches are presented, to then, make a a theoretical and conceptual approach on each of the research topics. Already since some decades ago, with the use and impact of the new technologies in archive work, the latter have gained in importance, for their great import in the reconstruction of collective memory, because of the guarantee they mean to the citizen rights and for the transparency that they demand from the public and private sector; also in the recovery of the documentary heritage, the evolution of the administrative trends in internal and quality control and, its incorporation into the educational field at the professional level...|$|E

40|$|<b>Archivistics</b> as a {{discipline}} born after the French Revolution and developped itself during the 19 th and 20 th centuries in a close relation with History. In fact, it started to be an auxiliary science of the historian (and even today it didn’t free completly from such role) and the archivist has been acting, mostly, as someone who prepares finding aids to enable researchers (that is historians) to do their job. This paradigm is in a crisis and starts to change to a new era, a post-custodial one, in which the relationship History / Archives must change and give place to an interdisciplinar y work: from one side, the historian, using information to understand the past and from the other side, the archivist / information professional, studying information {{in order to produce}} scientific knowledge upon it...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and conceptual {{approach to the}} pedagogical models in higher education —models focused on teaching and learning and models focused on education— and points out the model of Technical Rationality as an ideal model to the curricular conditions of the careers reunited under the label of Documentation and Information Systems: Librarianship and <b>Archivistics.</b> The acknowledgment of the dynamic character of the technical rationality model allows the academic community to promote processes of reflection on curricular redesign and adaptability to the technical and technological changes that support professional work. In this context, the paper approaches the change and unification of criteria in the educative institutions responsible {{for the education of}} professionals of information and documentation. The objective is to consolidate a reflection on the pertinence of the above mentioned pedagogical currents for the education of librarians and archivists, as well as to perform an analysis of their professional profile according to contemporary theoretical conceptions based on pedagogical and epistemological considerations...|$|E
40|$|With {{the recent}} {{changes that have}} {{occurred}} within the records environment, such as the problems of electronic records and increased demands for the societal accountability of the profession, archivists have had to rethink many of the principles that guide their activities. In other words, this concerns the connections between archival practice and archival theory, the latter of which has recently become a valid area of inquiry within professional discourse. Starting with the early professional literature contesting the need for archival theory and its necessary connection to archival practice, this section will address one ideology within clear roots in <b>archivistics,</b> that of Positivism. We will see that its â naturalizationâ (a process important to the concretization of ideology) was challenged through early literature on the subject. The threat to such deeply entrenched ideology was viewed within the profession either as a much-needed change or {{as a threat to the}} role of the archivist. Ultimately, the problematization of this ideology will inform the other two areas of analysis within this paper: the examination of â archival truthâ and the problems of representation within archives...|$|E
40|$|Development of Information Science {{paradigm}} is researched on the corpus of most cited references retrieved from doctoral dissertations in Information Science (from 1978 to 2007). New approach {{for analysis of}} scientific paradigm by empirical display of dominant zones within scientific {{paradigm is}} proposed: empirical knowledge zone, conceptual knowledge zone and research front zone. Alterations of scientific paradigm are followed across three time periods by display of most cited authors in librarianship, information systems, communicology, <b>archivistics</b> and documentation, museology and information science. Besides the data about most cited authors, the data about most cited references according to periods and disciplines are shown. Analysis of most cited references resulted with discovery of the dominant research topics in particular periods. Based on changes in research topics it can be concluded: a) which research topics were interesting for Information Science researchers in Croatia, and b) changes within Information Science paradigm, by tracking changes of key authors which are cited during period of thirty years.

As any artistic expression developed by man, music leaves a footprint, which could either be a paper or electronic-based document or a recording, but always, in any case, a musical document. Music archives, then, have emerged for the proper organization of these documents, which should not be seen as something new since their origins can be traced from the composition of the first musical works in ancient times, through the Middle Ages to our own times. Nowadays, the organization of documents has gained prominence due to the development of <b>archivistics</b> as a excellent tool in the process of information dissemination for the society of knowledge. The proper organization, conservation and dissemination of the musical heritage of a society, region or country become more relevant in a globalized world aiming to go beyond frontiers and cultures. Music is a significant element of the cultural identity of a society, and knowing how to properly gather and preserve this heritage through an adequate archivistic methodology becomes more and more important every day...|$|E
40|$|After the French Revolution, <b>Archivistics</b> {{developed}} as an auxiliary science, in {{the scope of}} History and Positivism. By the end of 19 th century, when the famous Manual of Dutch Archivists was published (1998), it started a disciplinary autonomy becoming a subject of technical character. The French model that expanded through the Europe is still dominant today, namely in what concerns archival education, and can be designated as the historicist, custodial and technical paradigm. The evolution of the professional education in Portugal {{in the area of}} Archives and Libraries, since the creation of the Librarian-Archivist Course, in 1887, and its substitute, in 1982, designated as Specialization Course in Documentary Sciences, has been always in accordance with such paradigm. The impact of the social, economic, cultural and technological conditions of Information Society in Portugal arises a new perspective that understands Archival Science as an applied discipline in the area of Information Science and, because of that, a new education model appeared in 2001, at under graduated level, in the University of Porto. It constitutes an innovative proposal in the scope of Information Science, oriented to educate information professionals able to work in any organisational context...|$|E

In the PhD thesis duchové dějiny is put into the wide context of the development of historical thinking and methodology in the 19 th and 20 th century. The PhD thesis treats the subdiscipline of duchové dějiny in many perspectives and at different levels and thematically is not enclosed by the boundaries of the duchové dějiny itself. The duchové dějiny is here in a way an optics through which one line of historiography and historical thinking in the 19 th and 20 th century is observed, treated and interpreted. The PhD thesis also aims to connect the history and its methodology with the <b>archivistics</b> and archival theory. In this way proposes the thesis certain solutions. Nowadays, duchové dějiny belongs rather to the marginal movements or subdisciplines in the historiography in the Czech and German speaking lands, contrary to intellectual history in Anglophone areas. In spite of this the PhD thesis tried to show, that the duchové dějiny is still alive, [...] ...|$|E
