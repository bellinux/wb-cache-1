5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of <b>around</b> <b>five</b> months. Within {{a few days}} of the impending birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may lie down and stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act out of sync with normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or anal prolapse may also occur, in which case either stitching or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E
5|$|After this tournament, the gambit {{finally began}} to be taken seriously. Top players like Savielly Tartakower and Siegbert Tarrasch started to play it. Schlechter {{published}} in 1918 the monograph Die budapester Verteidigung des Damengambits, which can be considered the first book on this opening. The gambit reached its peak of popularity (<b>around</b> <b>five</b> Budapest Gambits for every thousand games played) around 1920, {{so much so that}} many White players adopted the move-order 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 to avoid it.|$|E

More flowers open during the day than at night.|$|E

5|$|Casualties {{during the}} {{fighting}} around Isurava have been variously reported. In the immediate post war era, Australian sources tended {{to report a}} ratio of <b>around</b> <b>five</b> Japanese killed for every one Australian, with the Australians estimating that they had killed around 700 Japanese; however, in recent times this has been revised. The Japanese also initially over-estimated the casualties they inflicted on the Australians, claiming 1,000 killed, before reducing this to 300. It is now thought that the casualties were more even, although still favouring the Australians. For the Australians, casualties are now reported as 99 killed and 111 wounded while the Japanese {{are thought to have}} lost 140 killed and 231 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Euston was poorly {{served by}} the early London Underground network. The nearest station on the Metropolitan line was Gower Street, <b>around</b> <b>five</b> minutes' walk away. A {{permanent}} connection did not appear until 12 May 1907, when the City & South London Railway opened an extension north from Angel. The Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway opened an adjacent station on 22 June in the same year; these two stations {{are now part of}} the Northern line. Gower Street station was quickly renamed Euston Square in response. A connection to the Victoria line opened on 1 December 1968.|$|E

5|$|In a fatal attack, however, it manifests very quickly. In {{a number}} of cases, death has {{occurred}} within 24 hours of {{the onset of the}} infection, while other cases do not last longer than <b>around</b> <b>five</b> days. The virus attacks endothelial cells, rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging; once this reaches the heart, the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock. Symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat, a rapid heartbeat, and decreased blood-cell count, as well as cyanosis of the tongue, mouth ulcers, and oedema of the head and trunk.|$|E
5|$|Love, Inc. is an American {{television}} sitcom {{created by}} Andrew Secunda, which originally aired for one season on United Paramount Network (UPN) from September 22, 2005 to May 11, 2006. With an ensemble cast led by Busy Philipps, Vince Vieluf, Reagan Gomez-Preston, Ion Overman and Holly Robinson Peete, the show revolves <b>around</b> <b>five</b> matchmakers {{working at a}} dating agency. The series was produced by Chase TV, the Littlefield Company, Burg/Koules Television, and Paramount Television.

The executive producers were Adam Chase, Warren Littlefield, Mark Burg and Oren Koules.|$|E
5|$|The pied butcherbird {{is one of}} six (or seven) {{members of}} the genus Cracticus known as butcherbirds. Within the genus, it is most {{closely related to the}} Tagula butcherbird (C. louisiadensis) and hooded butcherbird (C. cassicus). The three form a {{monophyletic}} group within the genus, having diverged from ancestors of the grey butcherbird <b>around</b> <b>five</b> million years ago. The butcherbirds, Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen) and currawongs (Strepera spp.) were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by John Albert Leach after he had studied their musculature. American ornithologists Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between woodswallows and the butcherbirds in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini clade, which became the family Artamidae in 1994.|$|E
