25|$|On day 290, {{they are}} {{hanging out in}} a cafe. Tom {{wants to go back}} to Summer's place but she insists on seeing The Graduate and weeps at the ending, which surprises Tom as he'd <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a romantic fairy tale. They visit the record store, but Summer is distracted, appears to have lost {{interest}} in Tom, and kisses him good night. Tom tempts her with an offer of pancakes at a diner, where Summer casually announces that the relationship hasn't been working and breaks up with Tom while they are waiting for the food to arrive. Summer wants them to remain friends, but Tom is devastated.|$|E

50|$|On {{the matter}} of American colonial expansion, Carnegie had <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> an unwise gesture for the United States. He did not oppose the {{annexation}} of the Hawaiian islands or Puerto Rico, but he opposed the annexation of the Philippines. Carnegie believed that it involved a denial of the fundamental democratic principle, and he also urged William McKinley to withdraw American troops and allow the Filipinos {{to live with their}} independence. This act strongly impressed the other American anti-imperialists, who soon elected him vice-president of the Anti-Imperialist League.|$|R

500|$|In early March 2017, in an {{interview}} with Brie Larson, published by People magazine, Fonda stated, [...] "One of the great things the women's movement has done is to make us realise that (rape and abuse is) not our fault. We were violated and it's not right." [...] She said, [...] "I’ve been raped, I’ve been sexually abused as a child and I’ve been fired because I wouldn’t sleep with my boss." [...] She said, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my fault; that I didn’t do or say the right thing. I know young girls who’ve been raped and didn’t even know it was rape. They think, ‘It must have been because I said ‘no’ the wrong way.’" ...|$|E

"Marry You" [...] {{is one of}} {{the eleven}} songs {{composed}} and produced by The Smeezingtons, the collaboration of Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence, and Ari Levine, for Mars's debut studio album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans. Lawrence explained the inspiration behind the song in an interview with American Songwriter stating, [...] "e had this image of a slow-mo video in Vegas of a couple running, and she’s in her gown and he’s in his tux, the wedding party is behind them. This sort of crazy, daring, wedding feeling". Lawrence was surprised at the impact of the song after watching some YouTube videos. He stated that [...] "e <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a good song and catchy, but we didn’t think it would affect pop culture the way that it has. The first time we saw one of those YouTube videos...we were almost in tears... the power of what it is we can create. These ideas, words, and lyrics and how they can get into the fabric of society and affect people’s lives in such an amazing way." [...] In an interview with Idolator Bruno Mars said that the song had its beginning by [...] "just playing the chords," [...] and then freestyling the lyrics [...] "I think I wanna marry you!". He continued, [...] "you’re in Vegas...had way too many drinks, and you love everybody, and {{you want to do something}} that you probably shouldn’t do and you’ll regret in the morning." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon's first son, Julian, {{was born}} during his {{marriage}} to Cynthia as his commitments with the Beatles intensified {{at the height of}} Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, [...] "I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'" [...] Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, [...] "It's not an acid song." [...] McCartney corroborated Lennon's explanation that Julian innocently came up with the name. Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, [...] "Hey Jules", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song [...] "Hey Jude". Lennon later said, [...] "That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{record was}} not highly {{anticipated}} like the four-minute mile had been. In Philadelphia, {{there was little}} fanfare in The Philadelphia Inquirer or The Philadelphia Bulletin, which both had a box {{on the front page}} announcing the achievement with a story in the sports section. Philadelphia Daily News had no mention on its cover. The Bulletin wrote, [...] "Thus was fulfilled a prophecy made the first time the magnificent 7'1" [...] scoring star of the Warriors played a game in the National Basketball Association three years ago." [...] New York City papers ran stories from the news agencies. The New York Times and The New York Herald Tribune ran the AP story on pages 14 and 11, respectively. The New York Daily News ran the UPI story on page 26. The New York Post gave prominent back-page coverage to Chamberlain's feat on Sunday. The New York Daily News on Sunday wrote, [...] "Basketball is not prospering because most normal sized American youngsters or adults cannot identify themselves with the freakish stars ... You just can't sell a seven-foot basket stuffing monster to even the most gullible adolescent." [...] In his prime, Chamberlain was such a dominant scorer that his feat was mostly taken for granted. Warriors player Al Attles said that after Chamberlain's previous record 78-point game, [...] "It {{was only a matter of}} time until he reached 100, you could wait for it." [...] Warriors coach Frank McGuire initially thought the same thing, then said, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> inevitable that he would do it. But when he did, I stopped and thought about it. I couldn't believe it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Byrds' version, {{released}} {{as a single}} on April 2, 1968, reached number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100. They transformed it into a classic of the then burgeoning genre of country rock, whereas on the basement version the country music flavor {{is more of an}} undercurrent, suggested by [...] "the lilting chorus melody". Roger McGuinn felt that the song was perfect for the Byrds: [...] "It was country-ish and had that Dylan mystique where you couldn't really figure what he was talking about, yet the lyrics nevertheless drew you in. ... I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> about when Bob was laid up in Woodstock after the bike accident and sure wasn't going anywhere." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Olooya!" [...] He remembered {{suddenly}} that Jim had always used that word in speaking of her, {{but until then}} he had <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> some Indian term for her distinct class.|$|E

2500|$|Steve Kloves, the screenwriter for the {{previous}} instalments, returned for Goblet of Fire. On adapting the 734-page book into a feature-length film, Kloves commented that [...] "we <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> two movies, but we could never {{figure out a way}} to break it in two. So <b>it</b> will <b>be</b> a different experience from the book." ...|$|R
5000|$|The lyrics were {{groundbreaking}} and risqué {{for their}} time, telling stories not usually told in rock songs up to then, and containing references to prostitution, transsexuals, and oral sex. [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> kinda fun to introduce people to characters they maybe hadn't met before, or hadn't wanted to meet," [...] Reed said. The original release was a worldwide hit.|$|R

5000|$|While {{not playing}} with the band Trenchmouth, Armisen's {{interests}} switched to acting. In a January 2006 interview, he said, [...] "I {{wanted to be on}} TV somehow.

50|$|Balan {{kept away}} from the limelight and media. He never put a {{signature}} on his paintings, mosaics or murals. He was little known {{as a person and}} loved his anonymity.

6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{wondering}} {{when he was}} going to appear on the scene.

500|$|... "There {{was a line}} in one of {{the last}} episodes, [...] "one of them seems perfect for you" [...] and I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> that summed <b>it</b> up.

5000|$|Ultimately, U2 {{were not}} {{completely}} {{satisfied with the}} final result; producer Steve Lillywhite, who mixed the track, said, [...] "It never got finished the way they wanted <b>it.</b> They <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> could <b>be</b> a little bit better." [...] One of the issues was that the brass accompaniment played by the Arklow Silver Band was considered out of tune.
