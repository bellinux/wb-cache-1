40|$|A novel inverse {{simulation}} {{scheme is}} proposed for applications to rotorcraft dynamic models. The algorithm adopts an architecture that closely {{resembles that of}} a model predictive control scheme, where the controlled plant is represented by a high-order helicopter model. A fast solution of the inverse simulation step is obtained {{on the basis of}} a lower-order, simplified model. The resulting control action is then propagated forward in time using the more complex one. The algorithm compensates for discrepancies between the models by updating initial conditions for the inverse simulation step and introducing a simple guidance scheme in the definition of the tracked output variables. The proposed approach allows for the assessment of handling quality potential on the basis of the most sophisticated model, while keeping model complexity to a minimum for the computationally more demanding inverse simulation algorithm.

For a 35 ft/sec gust at a forwLard speed of 200 ft/sec, and typical rotor/fuselage clearance, this represents the limiting tip-speed ratio for either rotor. The better response of the see-saw rotor, however, makes it possible to increase the limiting tipxxpeed ratio by some form of flapping restraint. This has been investigated by considering the effects of springs and dampers, and offset and 63 -hinges...|$|E

The paper discusses {{a new concept}} of flow control in the cascade, inspired by fluidic amplifiers based on the Coanda effect. In place of mechanically <b>articulated</b> <b>blades,</b> the airfoil properties are controlled by auxiliary flow issuing from a slit nozzle in the blade.

The FLIGHTLAB parallel processing environment is explained, and the relative advantages of the blade element and rotor map models for rigid and elastic <b>articulated</b> <b>blades</b> are discussed. A UH- 60 simulation is conducted by means of a rigid model with 14 degrees of freedom, as well as an elastic model with 26 degrees of freedom, to compare trim conditions, longitudinal static margins, and longitudinal and lateral frequency responses. The FLIGHTLAB system is shown to facilitate restructuring for parallel processing as well as the systematic comparison of a variety of models.

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} {{development}} and initial testing of a digital resolver to replace existing analog signal processing instrumentation. Radiometers, mounted directly {{on one of the}} fully <b>articulated</b> <b>blades,</b> are electrically connected through a slip ring to analog signal processing circuitry. The measured signals are periodic with azimuth angle and are resolved into harmonic components, with 0 deg over the tail. The periodic nature of the helicopter blade motion restricts the frequency content of each flapping and yaw signal to the fundamental and harmonics of the rotor rotational frequency. A minicomputer is employed to collect these data and then plot them graphically in real time. With this and other information generated by the instrumentation, a helicopter test pilot can then adjust the helicopter model's controls to achieve the desired aerodynamic test conditions...|$|R
40|$|A novel inverse {{simulation}} {{scheme is}} proposed for application to rotorcraft dynamic models. The algorithm {{is based on}} a model predictive control scheme that allows for a faster solution of the inverse simulation step, working on a lowerorder, simplified helicopter model. The control action is then propagated forward in time on a more complete model. The algorithm compensates for discrepancies between the models by means of a simple guidance scheme. The proposed approach allows for the assessment of handling quality potential {{on the basis of the}} most sophisticated model, adopted for the forward simulation, while keeping model complexity to a minimum level for the computationally more demanding inverse simulation algorithm. This allows for a faster solution of the inverse problem, if compared with the computational time necessary for solving the same problem on the basis of the fullorder, more complex model. At the same time, the results are not a�ected by modeling approximations at the basis of the simpli�ed one.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{examination of}} flap-lag stability of a centrally hinged, spring-restrained rigid blade in both hover and forward flight is presented. Several {{differences in the}} equations of motion for blade flap-lag stability in the existing literature are identified. A rigorous and systematic development of these equations for a rigid <b>articulated</b> <b>blade</b> in forward flight shows the existence of some linear aerodynamic coupling terms associated with blade steady-state flapping and lagging in the perturbation equations. The differences identified are shown {{to be associated with}} the order in which the flap and lag transformations are taken in developing the equations of motion. The implications of these differences on stability are examined, and it is shown that the pitch-lag coupling terms associated with a flap-lag hinge transformation sequence have a marked influence on flap-lag stability. Some qualitative considerations on the role of the assumed transformation sequence in the development of the flap-lag equations for a hingeless elastic blade are also given. On the basis of these considerations, it is shown that aerodynamic coupling terms associated with blade steady-state flapping and lagging similar to those found for the rigid blade will also appear in the equations for the elastic blade...|$|E

40|$|The secure {{entry into}} service of a new rotor test rig {{requires}} {{the assessment of the}} dynamic and aeroelastic rotor stability. To this end, a multibody dynamics based numerical model was developed and coupled with an unsteady aerodynamic model based on Wagner's function and related enhancements for the general motion of an airfoil section considering heave and pitch motion. The simulation model uses modelling techniques for the setup of a linearized model and allows both, the investigation of ground resonance and flutter for the rig with clamped and <b>articulated</b> rotor <b>blades</b> in frequency domain. With respect to ground resonance, the dynamic examination of the two- and four-bladed rotor configurations shows a mechanically stable behaviour for the clamped and <b>articulated</b> rotor <b>blades</b> with lead-lag hinge in the planned rotor speed range up to 65 Hz. The aeroelastic assessment shows a damped behaviour for the configurations with clamped rotor <b>blades,</b> whilst the <b>articulated</b> rotor with lead-lag hinge is unstable beyond rotational speeds of 25 Hz for the two-bladed rotor and requires additional damping measures...|$|R
40|$|Two control schemes {{designed}} to alleviate gust-induced vibration are analytically investigated for a helicopter with four <b>articulated</b> <b>blades.</b> One {{is an individual}} blade pitch control scheme. The other is an adaptive blade pitch control algorithm based on linear optimal control theory. In both controllers, control inputs to alleviate gust response are superimposed on the conventional control inputs required to maintain the trim condition. A sinusoidal vertical gust model and a step gust model are used. The individual blade pitch control, in this research, is composed of sensors and a pitch control actuator for each blade. Each sensor can detect flapwise (or lead-lag or torsionwise) deflection of the respective blade. The acturator controls the blade pitch angle for gust alleviation. Theoretical calculations to predict the performance of this feedback system have been conducted {{by means of the}} harmonic method. The adaptive blade pitch control system is composed of a set of measurements (oscillatory hub forces and moments), an identification system using a Kalman filter, and a control system based on the minimization of the quadratic performance function...|$|R

40|$|A {{turbulence}} {{model has}} been developed for blade-element helicopter simulation. This model, called Simulation of Rotor Blade Element Turbulence (SORBET), uses an innovative temporal and geometrical distribution algorithm that preserves the statistical characteristics of the turbulence spectra over the rotor disc, while providing velocity components in real time to each of five blade-element stations along each of four blades. An initial investigation of SORBET has been performed using a piloted, motion-based simulation of the Sikorsky UH 60 A Black Hawk. Although only the vertical component of stochastic turbulence {{was used in this}} investigation, vertical turbulence components induce vehicle responses in all translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the helicopter. The single-degree-of-freedom configuration of SORBET was compared to a conventional full 6 -degrees-of-freedom baseline configuration, where translational velocity inputs are superimposed at the vehicle center of gravity, and rotational velocity inputs are created from filters that approximate the immersion rate into the turbulent field. For high-speed flight the vehicle responses were satisfactory for both models. Test pilots could not distinguish differences between the baseline configuration and SORBET. In low-speed flight the baseline configuration received criticism for its high frequency content, whereas the SORBET model elicited favorable pilot opinion. For this helicopter, which has fully <b>articulated</b> <b>blades,</b> results from SORBET show that vehicle responses to turbulent blade-station disturbances are severely attenuated. This is corroborated by in-flight observation of the rotor tip path plane as compared to vehicle responses...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{reducing}} helicopter rotor hub loads and marginally improving rotor {{performance by the}} introduction of large values of blade root torsional damping is presented. Basic theoretical considerations imply that these benefits in hub loads can come about by changes to the blade elastic torsional deflection. This basic theory was analytically verified by using a fully coupled aeroelastic rotorcraft analysis as applied to a modern, <b>articulated</b> rotor <b>blade,</b> namely that of the Sikorsky S- 76. From an implementation standpoint, a rotor-based torsional damping device may be more practical than one that involves a major portion of the blade span.

40|$|The flutter {{stability}} of flap bending, lead-lag bending, and torsion of helicopter rotor blades in hover is investigated using a finite element formulation based on Hamilton's principle. The blade {{is divided into}} a number of finite elements. Quasi-steady strip theory is used to evaluate the aerodynamic loads. The nonlinear equations of motion are solved for steady-state blade deflections through an iterative procedure. The equations of motion are linearized assuming blade motion to be a small perturbation about the steady deflected shape. The normal mode method based on the coupled rotating natural modes is used {{to reduce the number of}} equations in the flutter analysis. First the formulation is applied to single-load-path <b>blades</b> (<b>articulated</b> and hingeless <b>blades).</b> Numerical results show very good agreement with existing results obtained using the modal approach. The second part of the application concerns multiple-load-path blades, i. e. bearingless blades. Numerical results are presented for several analytical models of the bearingless blade.

Quasi-steady two-dimensional airfoil theory is used to obtain the aerodynamic loads. The rotor blade is discretized into beam elements, each with ten modal degrees of freedom. The resulting nonlinear equations of motion are solved for steady-state blade deflections through an iterative procedure. The flutter solution is calculated assuming blade motion to be a small perturbation about the steady solution.

Radial basis function and summation of two radial basis functions are used for interpolation. Radial basis function satisfies the Kronecker delta property and makes it simpler to apply the essential boundary conditions. Interpolation with summation of two radial basis functions increases the node carrying capacity within the sub-domain of the trial function and higher natural frequencies can be computed by selecting the complete domain as a sub-domain of the trial function. The mass and stiffness matrices are derived and numerical results for frequencies are obtained for a fixed-free beam and hinged-free beam simulating hingeless and <b>articulated</b> helicopter <b>blades.</b> Stiffness and mass distribution suitable for wind turbine blades are also considered.

These non-standard effects are formulated within the framework of finite element based multibody dynamics that allows the analysis of complex, flexible systems of arbitrary topology. The versatility and generality of the approach are demonstrated by presenting applications to aerospace systems: the flutter analysis of a wing-aileron system with freeplay, the impact of an <b>articulated</b> rotor <b>blade</b> on its doop stop during engagement operation in high wind conditions, and the dynamic response of a space antenna featuring joints with friction...|$|R
40|$|A {{conventional}} <b>articulated</b> rotor <b>blade</b> has mechanical flap and lag hinges, a lag damper, and a pitch bearing. In {{connection with}} an interest in designs of greater mechanical simplicity and increased maintainability, hingeless and bearingless rotors have been developed. A hingeless blade lacks the hinges and is cantilevered at the hub. It does have a pitch bearing for pitch control. A bearingless design eliminates the hinges and the pitch bearing as well. In the present investigation of bearingless rotor blade characteristics, finite element analysis has been successfully applied to determine the solutions of the nonlinear trim equations and the linearized flutter equations of multiple-load-path blades. The employed formulation is based on Hamilton's principle.

The proposed method is based on the deployment of Lagrange’s equation of motion to the three-dimensional kinematics of rotor blades.
