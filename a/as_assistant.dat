40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} internal audit outsourcing and internal audit’s involvement in consulting on external auditors’ reliance {{on the work of}} internal audit. We test whether these factors influence (i) reliance on internal audit work already undertaken and (ii) the use of internal auditors <b>as</b> <b>assistants.</b> In each case, we distinguish between control evaluation and substantive testing. We find that involvement in consulting impacts reliance on work undertaken and the use of internal auditors <b>as</b> <b>assistants</b> for control evaluation. External auditors make greater use of internal auditors <b>as</b> <b>assistants</b> for substantive testing when internal audit is provided in-house. Overall, external auditors use internal audit more for control evaluation tasks than for substantive testing. ...|$|R
