40|$|Abstract — An <b>automatic</b> <b>teller</b> <b>machine</b> {{requires}} a user {{to pass an}} identity test before any transaction can be granted. The current method available for access control in ATM is based on smartcard. Efforts were made to conduct an interview with structured questions among the ATM users and the result proofed {{that a lot of}} problems was associated with ATM smartcard for access control. Among the problems are; {{it is very difficult to}} prevent another person from attaining and using a legitimate persons card, also conventional smartcard can be lost, duplicated, stolen or impersonated with accuracy. To address the problems, the paper proposed the use of biometric voicebased access control system in <b>automatic</b> <b>teller</b> <b>machine.</b> In the proposed system, access will be authorized simply by means of an enroll user speaking into a microphone attached to the <b>automatic</b> <b>teller</b> <b>machine.</b> There are 2 phases in implementation of the proposed system: first training phase, second testing or operational phase as discussed in section 4 of this paper...|$|R
25|$|The first 50 million {{pieces of}} the new RM50 {{banknote}} features Malaysia's first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, at the historic declaration of Malaya's independence, and the logo of the 50th Anniversary of Independence on the reverse.
