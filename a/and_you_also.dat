500|$|Nikita and Maggie Q's {{portrayal}} of the character was met with generally positive reactions from television critics. Nikita was included in TV Guides lists of [...] "TV's Sexiest Crime Fighters" [...] and [...] "TV's Toughest Ladies". Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times felt that Q was suited for the role, stating [...] "she has a solemn, exotic beauty and hauteur that echo the heroine's self-possession and cool relentlessness," [...] adding [...] "Nikita is noticeably more hard-boiled and less girlish than the undercover agent played by Jennifer Garner on Alias, or the C.I.A. rookie that Piper Perabo plays on Covert Affairs." [...] Troy Patterson of Slate felt that [...] "Ms. Q's Nikita is only half so crush-worthy as Bionic Woman's Jaime Sommers or Dollhouse's what's-her-name, but her predicament is no less tasty." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today believed Q's performance was [...] "a fairly sizable incentive" [...] to watch the show, adding she [...] "combines stunt-fighting chops and lithe beauty with an unusual-for-the-genre air of somber intelligence. Her Nikita is not above cracking a joke, but it's clear from Q's eyes and bearing that she has suffered {{at the hands of}} evil men, and she's {{not going to take it}} anymore." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix believed that Q [...] "carries herself in a way that makes it believable she could be a hard-core killer, and she has the requisite dramatic chops and charisma for the part." [...] Maureen Ryan of AOL TV said [...] "Maggie Q, has real charisma and presence; she invests Nikita's drive to bring down the secretive Division with potent energy. You have to believe that Nikita would devote her life to wreaking vengeance on the people she views as her former captors, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>also</b> have to buy her as a butt-kicking, gun-toting action heroine who also looks great in a cocktail gown. Maggie Q makes all those things look easy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lacking the {{business}} focus of Albert Weber Sr., {{but not his}} energy and zest for life, Weber Jr. was also known {{as something of a}} hothead and even spent a night in jail for assault. [...] This 1896 assault charge, when Weber Jr. was 38 years old, gives some insight into his character, with the magistrate remarking [...] "You had no right to call this man names, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>also</b> had no right to flourish a loaded revolver in that dangerous manner. [...] I fine you $5." [...] Unfortunately for Weber, the only thing in his pockets was a bean shooter, so he spent the night in jail as he failed to produce the necessary $5. [...] This incident occurred at the Weber Company's showrooms on Fifth Avenue in September 1896. [...] Only a few weeks later, Weber had a mental breakdown that required he be taken to Bellevue Hospital's insane pavilion, although this may have been an attempt to escape from his creditors.|$|E
