5|$|In 1964, Altgens testified for the Warren Commission and {{was asked}} about the gunfire <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> knew its source. He said he had not been keeping track of the number of gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza because he {{believed}} them to be fireworks, but he was certain of at least two. Altgens believed Kennedy's wounds suggested a final shot that came from the vicinity of the book depository building, but he could not say with any certainty.|$|E
5|$|In the flashbacks, Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) {{struggles with}} his ex-girlfriend Susan Lloyd (Tamara Taylor), who has asked Michael to sign away his {{paternal}} rights to their son, Walt. Though Michael initially resists, suing {{in order to}} keep his custody, he eventually relents as Susan persuades him to doubt his own motivations <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> is pursuing his own desires or Walt's best interests.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} crisis surrounding Leopold III's role during the occupation, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> {{could return to}} the throne, polarized Belgian public opinion {{in the years following}} the war between Catholics, notably in Flanders, who broadly supported his return, and Socialists, in Wallonia and Brussels, who were strongly opposed to it. After a general strike and an indecisive referendum, the king resigned in favour of his son, Baudouin, in 1950.|$|E

5|$|Wighard (or Wigheard; died between 664 and 667) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop-elect of Canterbury. What {{little is known}} about him comes from 8th-century writer Bede, but {{inconsistencies}} between various works have led to confusion about the exact circumstances of Wighard's election <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> was ever confirmed in that office. What is clear is that he died in Rome after travelling there for confirmation by the papacy of his elevation to the archbishopric. His death allowed Pope Vitalian to select the next archbishop from amongst the clergy in Rome.|$|E
5|$|A Norman medieval chronicler {{claimed that}} Robert {{travelled}} to Normandy in 1051 or 1052 and told Duke William of Normandy, the future William the Conqueror, that Edward wished {{for him to}} become his heir. The exact timing of Robert's trip, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> actually made it, {{have been the subject}} of debate among historians. The archbishop died in exile at Jumièges sometime between 1052 and 1055. Robert commissioned significant building work at Jumièges and was probably involved in the first Romanesque building in England, the church built in Westminster for Edward the Confessor, now known as Westminster Abbey. Robert's treatment by the English was used by William the Conqueror as one of the justifications for his invasion of England.|$|E
5|$|Hanna M. Roisman compares Kint to Odysseus, {{capable of}} {{adapting}} both his personality and his tales {{to his current}} audience. Throughout his tale, Kint adapts his confession to Kujan's revealed biases. Roisman draws direct parallels to Odysseus' tales to the Phaeacians: like Odysseus, Kint allows his audience to define him and his narrative. Appealing to Kujan's arrogance, Kint allows himself to be outwitted, humiliated, and broken by his interrogator; Kint further invents a mythical villain that he credulously believes in and gives Kujan the privileged perspective of the skeptic. Kint thus creates a neo-noir thriller inside of a neo-noir thriller and demonstrates the artificiality of storytelling. Benjamin Widiss identifies post-structural elements to the film, such as {{the lack of a}} clear protagonist throughout much of the film. This extends to ambiguity over Kint's role as author or reader, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> is Kint pretending to be Söze or the reverse.|$|E

5000|$|Heat (2006) is Bufords {{account of}} working for free {{in the kitchen of}} Babbo, a New York City {{restaurant}} owned by chef Mario Batali. Bufords premise is that he considered himself a capable home cook <b>and</b> wondered <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had the skills to work in a busy restaurant kitchen. He met Batali at a dinner party <b>and</b> asked <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would take on Buford as his [...] "kitchen bitch." ...|$|R
5|$|Yajnavalkya {{answers that}} one may {{complete}} Brahmacharya (the student stage of life), then Grihastha (householder), followed by Vanaprastha (retirement) and finally Sannyasa (pilgrimage as Parivrajaka Bhikshu, renunciation). Or, continues Yajnavalkya, one may renounce immediately {{after completing the}} student stage of life, or after the householder stage, {{regardless of whether or}} not one has completed the sacred fire ritual or any other rituals. Olivelle interprets the sacred fire ritual reference as an indirect reference to marriage, and thus the text asserts that those who have married or never married can both renounce. The Jabala Upanishad herein recommends that a person may renounce on the day he feels detached from the world, regardless of which stage of life he is in, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> has completed that stage.|$|E

25|$|Controversy over George W. Bush's {{military}} {{service in the}} National Guard was an issue that first gained widespread public attention during the 2004 presidential campaign.

25|$|Although {{the exact}} {{sequence}} of events is unclear, evidence suggests that at first the troika nominated Trotsky to head second-rate government departments (e.g., Gokhran, the State Depository for Valuables.)) When Trotsky predictably refused, they tried to use this {{as an excuse to}} oust him. At this time there was speculation about Trotsky's health <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had epilepsy.|$|E

25|$|The Irish annals record {{nothing of}} Giric's reign, nor do Anglo-Saxon {{writings}} add anything, and the meagre information which survives is contradictory.
