40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to prepare diblock-copolymer which rapidly changes its {{solubility}} in the dependency of the temperature. Appropriate diblock-copolymer should consist of one active (hydrophilic) component, and hydrophobic matrix block. The active component should have the switching temperature {{as close as possible}} to the human body temperature. Diblock-copolymer should exhibit sufficient mechanical stability, and the polydispersity index should be as low as possible. The mechanically stable components of the diblock copolymer were, polystyrene (PS) or poly(tert-butylmethacrylate) (PtBMA), while as an active component, poly-(2 -(2 ethoxy) -ethoxy) methoxy methatcrylate (PDEGMA) was used. A polymer required for this purpose should have molar mass of at least 150000 g/mol (in order to posses mechanical stability), and molar ratio of PDEGMA of 0. 20 – 0. 40 (in order to get desired structure of hexagonally packed cylinders of PDEGMA in the matrix). The syntheses were performed via different polymerization mechanisms (sequential anionic polymerization, group transfer polymerization, <b>atomic</b> <b>transfer</b> radical polymerization, combination of anionic and <b>atomic</b> <b>transfer</b> radical polymerization. The highest molar masses (Mn> 20000 g/mol), lowest polydispersities (Mw/Mn< 1. 1), and molar amounts of DEGMA exceeding 10 % were gained by sequential anionic polymerization. Group transfer polymerization was performed successfully for molar masses up to 22000 g/mol, but no phase separation has been achieved.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{coherent}} control of atomic states, preparation of atoms in a stable superposition state, and <b>atomic</b> population <b>transfer</b> has attracted much attention in the last decade. One of the main motivations {{is associated with the}} rapid development of the field of quantum computing. One of the key problems of quantum information processing is the construction of given coherent superposition atomic states in a macroscopic volume. Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) [1] is considered to be the most common method for <b>atomic</b> population <b>transfer</b> in quantum systems. Being analyzed in detail on various quantum systems from both theoretical and experimental points of view, this method is widely adopted for the implementation of tools as optical devices for atomic beams, control of chemical reactions, high-precision magnetometry, atom cooling, etc. Meanwhile, an alternative method for population transfer, based on the intuitive pulse sequence with large one-photon detunings was demonstrated in [2]. In contrast with the STIRAP method, where the population transfer is realized via a dark state, the population transfer for the intuitive pulse sequence is obtained via a bright state. The authors of [2] called the <b>atomic</b> population <b>transfer</b> of this kind b-STIRAP. A detailed theoretical analysis of the b-STIRAP process in media with equal oscillator strength on adjacent transitions was performed in [3]. However, it is well-known that an oscillator strengths ratio different from unity can considerably impact on the coherent processes in Λ-media (see e. g. [4]). In the present work an analytical and numerical analysis of the b-STIRAP process in a medium with unequal oscillator strengths is performed. It is shown that the length of population transfer can be considerably increased by an appropriate choice of the dipole transitions. 1. N. V. Vitanov, B. W. Shore,K. Bergman, Adv.

We deal with nonseparable lattices considering different initial atomic distributions in the highly symmetric states.

By direct numerical simulations, we show that two-mode models provide accurate description of the tunneling when either initially two states are populated or tunneling occurs between two stable states. Otherwise a two-mode model may give only useful qualitative hints for understanding tunneling but does not reproduce many features of the phenomenon. This reflects crucial role of the instabilities developed due to two-body interactions resulting in non-negligible population of the higher bands.

The influence of the molecular architecture of PAM on the rheological properties in aqueous solution has been investigated. The well-known theory of increased entanglement density by branching for polymers in the melt can also be applied to polymers in the semi-dilute water solutions. We have demonstrated this by investigating the rheological properties of PAM of similar molecular weights with different molecular architectures. Interestingly, the solution viscosity of a comb PAM is higher compared to its linear and star analogues (both at equal span molecular weight, M-n,M-SPAN, and total molecular weight, M-n,M-tot). In addition to the pure viscosity, we also demonstrate that the visco-elastic properties of the polymeric solutions depend significantly on the molecular architecture of the employed PAM.

The tendency for domain formation increases with the length of the alkyl chains and is much more pronounced for lower pH, while at high pH the electrostatic charging suppresses the formation of hydrophobic domains for chains shorter than octyl.
