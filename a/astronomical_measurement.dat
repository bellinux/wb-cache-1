25|$|In modern Western astrology {{the planets}} {{represent}} basic drives or impulses {{in the human}} psyche. These planets differ from {{the definition of a}} planet in astronomy in that the sun, moon, and recently, Pluto and Ceres (considered as dwarf planets in astronomy), are all considered to be planets for the purposes of astrology. Each planet is also said to be the ruler of one or two zodiac signs. The three modern planets have each been assigned rulership of a zodiac sign by astrologers and Ceres has been suggested as the ruler of Taurus or Virgo. Traditionally rulership of the signs was, according to Ptolemy, based on seasonal derivations and <b>astronomical</b> <b>measurement,</b> whereby the luminaries being the brightest planets were given rulership of the brightest months of the year and Saturn the coldest furthest classical planet was given to the coldest months of the year, with the other planets ruling the remaining signs as per <b>astronomical</b> <b>measurement.</b> It is noteworthy that the modern rulerships do not follow the same logic.|$|E

50|$|Transit mounts {{are single}} axis mounts fixed in azimuth while {{rotating}} in altitude, usually oriented on a north-south axis. This allows the telescope {{to view the}} whole sky, but only when the Earth's rotation allows the objects to cross (transit) through that narrow north-south line (the meridian).

He develops non-LTE radiative transfer models and quantum molecular models at GSFC resulting in billions of spectral lines suitable for cometary, planetary and astrophysical sciences, including exoplanets.

Shen discovered the concept of true north in terms of magnetic declination towards the north pole, with experimentation of suspended magnetic needles and [...] "the improved meridian determined by Shen's <b>astronomical</b> <b>measurement</b> of the distance between the pole star and true north". This was the decisive step in human history to make compasses more useful for navigation, and may have been a concept unknown in Europe for another four hundred years (evidence of German sundials made circa 1450 show markings similar to Chinese geomancer compasses in regard to declination).|$|E
50|$|K {{correction}} is {{a correction}} to an astronomical object's magnitude (or equivalently, its flux) {{that allows a}} measurement of a quantity of light from an object at a redshift z to be converted to an equivalent measurement in the rest frame of the object. If one could measure all the light from an object at all wavelengths (a bolometric flux), a K correction would not be required. If one measures the light emitted in an emission line, a K-correction is not required. The need for a K-correction arises because an <b>astronomical</b> <b>measurement</b> through a single filter or a single bandpass only sees {{a fraction of the}} total spectrum, redshifted into the frame of the observer. So if the observer wants to compare the measurements through a red filter of objects at different redshifts, the observer will have to apply estimates of the K corrections to these measurements to make a comparison.|$|E
50|$|These {{and other}} <b>astronomical</b> <b>measurements</b> {{constrain}} the spatial curvature {{to be very}} close to zero, although they do not constrain its sign.

2500|$|Most of our {{knowledge}} of it comes from Strabo, according to whom Hipparchus thoroughly and often unfairly criticized Eratosthenes mainly for internal contradictions and inaccuracy in determining positions of geographical localities.

50|$|The first {{documented}} {{testimony of}} an <b>astronomical</b> <b>measurement</b> done in Chile is {{the observation of}} a lunar eclipse by the soldier Pedro Cuadrado Chavino (June 1582). He used a classic Greek method to obtain the latitude {{of the city of}} Valdivia based on the eclipse's measurements. In 1849, during the government of Manuel Bulnes, a scientific mission from the U.S. navy run by James M. Gilliss arrived to Chile for observing Venus and Mars to calculate the Earth-Sun distance. The Gilliss mission established the first astronomical observatory in the Cerro Santa Lucia (Santiago). In 1852, the facilities were transferred to Chile and the National Astronomical Observatory was created.During {{the second half of the}} 20th century, observatories from the U.S. and Europe were installed in different locations at the north of the country: La Silla, Cerro Tololo, Las Campanas and later Cerro Paranal, Cerro Pachon and Chajnantor.|$|E
50|$|Ole Christensen Rømer used an <b>astronomical</b> <b>measurement</b> to {{make the}} first {{quantitative}} estimate of the speed of light. When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the diameter of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference {{in the time it takes}} light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect for Jupiter's innermost moon Io and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.|$|E
5000|$|Andrés de San Martín, {{according}} to Tim Joyner, {{was the most}} eminent cosmographer in the fleet, unequaled by {{no one in the}} fleet, not even by the greatest mariner of all time, Ferdinand Magellan. Twice, he was able to calculate accurately, using <b>astronomical</b> <b>measurement,</b> the longitudes of two places, Port San Julian at Patagonia and Homonhon Island in the Philippines. At San Julian, he brought out his instruments, to quote Tim Joyner, [...] "to test Faleiro's (Ruy) Failero system for using conjunctions of the moon with the planets to determine longitude. His measurements resulted in the astonishingly accurate estimate of 61° west of Seville. Less than one degree in error, this was an accomplishment far beyond the capabilities of the other pilots." [...] Again, at Homonhon Island, in central Philippines, he was able to measure its longitude, {{according to}} Rolando A. Laguardia Trias. Trias asserts that the reading of 189° longitude [...] "from the meridian" [...] which meant the line of demarcation at 47° west of Greenwich. In today's system of reckoning Homonhon Is. is at 125° 42.8' east longitude.|$|E
50|$|A common {{year is a}} {{calendar}} year with exactly 365 days, {{in contrast to the}} longer leap year. More generally, a common year is one without intercalation.
