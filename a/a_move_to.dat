5|$|In July 1945, Lawton handed in a {{transfer}} request at Everton {{as he wanted}} <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> a Southern club so as {{to see more of}} his increasingly estranged wife. In November 1945, he was sold to Chelsea for a fee of £14,000. Chelsea continued to play regional wartime fixtures as national league football had not resumed for the 1945–46 season, and Lawton also continued his uncapped appearances for the England national team. In the summer of 1946, following his demobilisation, he coached for the FA in a summer camp in Switzerland. He scored a club record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946–47 season. However he struggled to settle at Stamford Bridge and came into conflict with manager Billy Birrell after refusing to go on a pre-season tour of Sweden in 1947, which resulted in him requesting {{a transfer}}. He favoured <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Arsenal, but this was ruled out by the Chelsea hierarchy. Lawton turned down an approach by Sunderland manager Bill Murray as he held out hope that Chelsea would relent and allow him <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|During the club's victory parade, {{with only}} one year left on his {{contract}} Chamakh declared {{that he would be}} staying at Bordeaux for the 2009–10 season, despite strong interest from Premier League club Arsenal.

On 3 August 2009, president Jean-Louis Triaud declared that Arsenal had sent a bid of €7million for Chamakh and that he had rejected it, demanding that Arsenal improve its offer. The following day, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger announced {{that he would not be}} offering a better deal and declared the possible transfer dead. The announcement subsequently led Chamakh to confirm his intent to remain at Bordeaux for the 2009–10 season. On 29 August, Chamakh reportedly snubbed <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> West Ham United. The club offered Bordeaux £18million for the player and offered Chamakh a four-year contract worth £3million a year.
