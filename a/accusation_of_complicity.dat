There lay, singly or in heaps, the unnumbered dead, of every age and sex, the illustrious with the obscure. Kinsfolk and friends {{were not allowed to}} be near them, to weep over them, or even to gaze on them too long. Spies were set round them, who noted the sorrow of each mourner and followed the rotting corpses, till they were dragged to the Tiber, where, floating or driven on the bank, no one dared to burn or to touch them.|$|E

An <b>accusation</b> <b>of</b> <b>complicity</b> in the conspiracy of 1800-1801 was speedily retracted, but in 1806 Napoleon consented to refund Neuville's confiscated estate on condition that he should go to the United States. De Neuville settled near New Brunswick, New Jersey, where his house became a place of refuge for French exiles. In 1813 he was instrumental in helping his friend, General Moreau to accept service in the army of the emperor of Russia. He returned to France after the replacement of the French Empire by the 1814 Bourbon Restoration.|$|E
50|$|At {{the request}} of the pope he drew up a report of two hundred pages on the Inquisition in Portugal, with the result that after a {{judicial}} inquiry Pope Innocent XI suspended it in Portugal for seven years (1674-81). Ultimately, Vieira returned to Portugal with a papal bull exempting him from the jurisdiction of the grand inquisitor, and in January 1681 he embarked for Brazil. He resided in Bahia and occupied himself in revising his sermons for publication, and in 1687 he became superior of the province. A false <b>accusation</b> <b>of</b> <b>complicity</b> in an assassination, and the intrigues of members of his own Company, clouded his last months, and on 18 July 1697 he died in Salvador, Bahia.|$|E

He withdrew the annexation treaty from consideration, mounted an inquiry, and recommended {{the restoration of}} Liliuokalani as queen. Further investigation by Congress led to the Morgan Report, which established that the actions of U.S. troops were completely neutral, and exonerated the U.S. from any <b>accusations</b> <b>of</b> <b>complicity</b> with the overthrow.|$|R

South African rugby fans remained skeptical of this theory and preferred to put it down to sour Kiwi grapes. To my fellow South Africans I want to say this: Stop all those cheap jokes about Suzie, the food poisoning and whingeing Kiwis. It happened.

50|$|The Alcmaeonids {{were allowed}} {{back into the}} city in 594 BC, during the archonship of Solon. During the tyranny of Pisistratus, the Alcmaeonid Megacles married his {{daughter}} to Pisistratus, but when the tyrant refused to have children with her, Megacles banished him. Later the Alcmaeonids would claim to have been exiled following Pisistratus' return in 546 BC so as {{to distance themselves from}} possible <b>accusations</b> <b>of</b> <b>complicity,</b> but epigraphic evidence in fact proves that Cleisthenes was archon for the year 525-4. Megacles was able to marry (for a second or third time) Agarista, the daughter of the tyrant Cleisthenes of Sicyon. They had two sons, Hippocrates and Cleisthenes, the reformer of the Athenian democracy. Hippocrates' daughter was Agariste, the mother of Pericles.|$|R
5000|$|The Rebbe's extravagant {{lifestyle}} and prestige aroused {{the envy of}} Tsar Nicholas I and the ire of the Jewish maskilim (members of the Jewish Enlightenment movement); the latter continually plotted {{to bring about the}} Rebbe's downfall. In 1838, at the height of a two-year investigation of the murder of two Jewish informers, the Rebbe was arrested by the governor-general of Berdichev on the <b>accusation</b> <b>of</b> <b>complicity</b> in the murders. He was brought before the Tsar, whose own agents told him that the Rebbe was trying to establish his own kingdom and was fomenting opposition to the government. The Tsar had the Rebbe jailed in Donevitz for seven months, and then imprisoned in Kiev for fifteen months, pending a decision on exiling him to the Caucasus or Siberia. No formal charges were ever filed against him, and no trial was ever held. On 19 February 1840 (Shushan Purim 5600), the Rebbe was suddenly released. But he was still subject to the allegation of opposing the government, and was placed under police surveillance at his home, which made it increasingly difficult for his Hasidim to visit him. The Rebbe decided to move to Kishinev, where the district authority was more lenient, and his family joined him. When his Hasidim found out through inside sources that Tsar was going ahead with his plan to exile the Rebbe for his attempts to create a [...] "Jewish kingdom", they bribed the governor of Kishinev to provide the Rebbe with an exit visa to Moldavia. Just as the Rebbe was leaving Kishinev, the government orders for his arrest and deportation arrived. When the Rebbe reached Iaşi, capital of Moldavia, his Hasidim obtained for him a travel pass to cross the border into Austria. His plight became an international cause célèbre, with Hasidim and non-Hasidim throughout Eastern Europe petitioning government officials and even priests to save the Rebbe from extradition and exile.Moving from town to town — including Shatsk in Bukovina (which belonged to Austria), Kompling, and Skola — the Rebbe ended up in Sadigura, Bukovina, home to the second-largest Jewish community in Austria (after Chernowitz). In that town, 40 years before, a 10-year-old boy named Yisroel Donenfeld had disappeared without a trace. The Rebbe presented himself as the long-lost Yisroel, and with the testimony of eight men who affirmed that he was born in Sadigura, he received citizenship papers. His Hasidim helped him purchase property in the town and show proof that he had 20,000 crowns for his support, whereupon he received honorary citizenship and the protection of the Austrian government. In the summer of 1842, the Rebbe's family was finally allowed to join him, on condition that they relinquish all rights to visit or return to Russia.|$|E
500|$|English {{merchants in}} Boston had long traded with Port Royal, {{and some of}} this {{activity}} had continued illegally after the war began. [...] However, the business was being hurt by the war, and some merchants began making vocal calls for action, and public outrage rose over {{the failure of the}} Massachusetts defenses to stop the French and Indian raids. [...] Massachusetts Bay Governor Joseph Dudley had made repeated requests to London for support without any success, and finally decided to act independently to fend off <b>accusations</b> <b>of</b> <b>complicity</b> in the illegal trade. [...] In spring of 1707, he authorized an expedition against Port Royal. [...] This expedition made two separate attempts to take Port Royal; for a variety of reasons, both attempts failed despite the expedition's significant numerical superiority.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{argues that}} the {{critical}} organisational scholarship on men and masculinities is heteronormative, in its tendency to normalise white, middle-class, heterosexual, able-bodied gender norms. If it is to avoid <b>accusations</b> <b>of</b> <b>complicity</b> in reproducing heteronormative analyses of men and masculinities, the field itself must acknowledge and address its omissions. This chapter identifies some of those missing men and masculinities by drawing on the sexuality of organisation scholarship, focusing specifically on gay and bisexual men. As such, the principal aim of this chapter is {{to engage in a}} process of queering organisational men and masculinities, with a view to engendering dialogues between organisational scholars interested in men and masculinities and those scholars involved in examining gay and bi sexualities at work. Introducing and mobilising queer theories, this chapter seeks to furnish researchers with insights into how heteronormativities and the organisational lives of all men and women influence each other...|$|R

40|$|Modernity {{remains the}} privileged {{theoretical}} frame and narrative for long term processes {{at the global}} scale, notwithstanding the heterogeneously contested definition of its spatiotemporal coordinates, the irreconcilability of contradictions inherent to its alleged emancipatory power and the <b>accusations</b> <b>of</b> <b>complicity</b> with Eurocentrism. This article explores some logical, epistemological and historical-sociological contradictions inherent {{in the effort to}} produce non-euorcentric categories of social and historical analysis, and explains why such an effort is doomed to failure if modernity keeps on being accepted as the epistemic territory within which such an effort is located. Eurocentrism is thus defined as palingenetic, to the extent it constantly shifts its contextual meaning while reformulating European centrality in different and ever-changing modalities; such properties of Eurocentrism as a paradigm are conceptualized in terms of its ability to operate by means of consequential isomorphism. Evidences from recent debates in history of scientific modernity are considered, in order to articulate analytical tensions between connected histories and dialogical civilizational narratives of East and West relation at the global scale. The impossibility to explain the ‘why’ of modernity according to a coherent ‘how’ of modernity without falling into Eurocentric structures of thinking is assessed. Finally, theoretical project of “unthinking modernity” is introduced as a possible way to reframe the problem of Eurocentric limits in historical and social sciences...|$|R
50|$|In 1994, a 14-year-old named Segametsi Mogomotsi {{was murdered}} in Mochudi, Botswana and body parts removed. The killing was widely {{believed}} to have been for muti, and the police even recovered some excised organs. However, these were destroyed before being tested to establish them as human, leading to <b>accusations</b> <b>of</b> police <b>complicity</b> with the murder. The killing led to riots as students in Mochudi protested about police inaction, and eventually Scotland Yard from Britain were asked to investigate, as neutral outsiders. Their report was given to the Botswana government, which did not release it to the public. These events inspired some of the events in the book The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency by Alexander McCall Smith.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I Wangenheim was instrumental in securing the entry of the Ottoman Empire into the war {{as part of the}} Central Powers. Wangenheim oversaw Max von Oppenheim's successful attempt to get the Ottoman Caliph Mehmed V to declare Jihad against the Triple Entente. During the time of Armenian Genocide there were <b>accusations</b> <b>of</b> German <b>complicity</b> and question's were raised as to Wangenheim's position of 'non-intervention'; the American Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire Henry Morgenthau in his book Ambassador Morgenthau's Story (1918) would virulently criticise Wangenheim's role. In an interview with an American journalist, Wangenheim stated: [...] "I do not blame the Turks for what they are doing to the Armenians...They are entirely justified".|$|R
50|$|Relations between Morocco and Mauritania {{continued}} to improve through 1986, reflecting President Taya's pragmatic, if unstated, view {{that only a}} Moroccan victory over the Polisario would end the guerrilla war in the Western Sahara. Taya made {{his first visit to}} Morocco in October 1985 (prior to visits to Algeria and Tunisia) in the wake of Moroccan claims that Polisario guerrillas were again traversing Mauritanian territory. The completion of a sixth berm just north of Mauritania's crucial rail link along the border with the Western Sahara, between Nouadhibou and the iron ore mines, complicated relations between Mauritania and Morocco. Polisario guerrillas in mid-1987 had to traverse Mauritanian territory to enter the Western Sahara, a situation that invited Morocco's <b>accusations</b> <b>of</b> Mauritanian <b>complicity.</b> Moreover, any engagements near the sixth berm would threaten to spill over into Mauritania and jeopardize the rail link.|$|R
5000|$|Al-Qaeda leaders regard Shia Muslims as heretics {{and have}} {{attacked}} their mosques and gatherings. In Iraq it considers Shi'i civilians to be legitimate targets for acts of violence. The {{group has been}} designated as terrorist organization by Iran and many other countries, and Iran has a hostile relationship with the group. However, allegedly Al-Qaeda and Iran formed an alliance during the 1990s in which Hezbollah trained al Qaeda operatives. Iran detained hundreds of al Qaeda operatives that entered the country following the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan; even though [...] "the Iranian government has held most of them under house arrest, limited their freedom of movement, and closely monitored their activities," [...] U.S. officials have expressed concerns that Iran has not fully accounted for their whereabouts, culminating in <b>accusations</b> <b>of</b> Iranian <b>complicity</b> in the 2003 Riyadh compound bombings.|$|R
5000|$|Again, {{elements}} of absurdity ("We must offer {{every child in}} America three nuclear missiles") are combined with the <b>accusation</b> <b>of</b> US <b>complicity</b> with terrorists ("One by one the terrorists are learning: We are building a culture to encourage international terrorism"), probably due to state terrorism in the like of economic espionage conducted by ECHELON, which had been revealed by the EU parliament on July 11, 2001, the strategy of tension brought by Gladio due to Licio Gelli from the (former) masonic lodge Propaganda Due, Operation Northwoods, MKULTRA, Project FUBELT, Operation Condor, Operation Satanique, Operation Cyclone and the financing of the Maktab al-Khidamat, which is the precursor of Al-Qaeda. Unlike the first [...] "speech", this one also addresses the 2003 invasion of Iraq ("And tonight I have a message {{for the people of}} Iraq: Go home and die").

5|$|Themistocles {{first went}} to live in exile in Argos. However, perceiving that they now had a prime {{opportunity}} to bring Themistocles down for good, the Spartans again levelled <b>accusations</b> <b>of</b> Themistocles's <b>complicity</b> in Pausanias's treason. They demanded that he be tried by the 'Congress of Greeks', rather than in Athens, although it seems {{that in the end}} he was actually summoned to Athens to stand trial. Perhaps realising he had little hope of surviving this trial, Themistocles fled, first to Kerkyra, and thence to Admetus, king of Molossia. Themistocles's flight probably only served to convince his accusers of his guilt, and he was declared a traitor in Athens, his property to be confiscated. It should be noted that both Diodorus and Plutarch considered that the charges were false, and made solely for the purposes of destroying Themistocles. The Spartans sent ambassadors to Admetus, threatening that the whole of Greece would go to war with the Molossians unless they surrendered Themistocles. Admetus, however, allowed Themistocles to escape, giving him a large sum of gold to aid him on his way. Themistocles then fled from Greece, apparently never to return, thus effectively bringing his political career to an end.|$|R

It explores her explicit use of terms such as ‘heart of whiteness’ and ‘heart of blackness’. Claims that Krog essentialises Africa and ‘black’ people are investigated. The article also addresses <b>accusations</b> <b>of</b> racism in Krog’s work. A partial answer to the persistent question of why Krog is so determinedly focused on ‘race’ is sought in the concept <b>of</b> <b>complicity.</b> There is definite specificity in the way Krog writes about ‘white’ perpetrators and ‘black’ victims in South Africa, but her trilogy should be read within the broader context of international restitution discourses, allowing for a somewhat different perspective on her contribution to {{the discussion of the}} issue of whether ‘white’ people belong in (South) Africa...|$|R

Part I reviews the legal standards establishing extrajudicial executions of street children as a major human rights violation and the Honduran State 2 ̆ 7 s duty to investigate. Part I also examines challenges facing Honduran investigative police agencies, including budget crises and <b>accusations</b> <b>of</b> corruption and <b>complicity.</b> Part I concludes with a review of the structure and function of the U. N. Commission on Human Rights (“Commission”) and the investigative standards set forth in the U. N. Principles. Part II of this Note discusses competing frameworks for Commission reform, focusing on the proposal of the High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges, and Change (“High Level Panel Proposal”), the proposal of U. N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan (“Report of Secretary-General”), and the proposal of Human Rights Watch (“HRW”) and the international human rights non-governmental organization (“NGO”) community (“HRW Proposal”). Part II also reviews the U. N. Draft Text (“Draft Text”) on the creation of the Human Rights Council (“Council”). Part III of this Note argues that the HRW Proposal best conceives of Commission reform vis-à-vis the U. N. Principles. Part III also proposes that, in restructuring the U.
