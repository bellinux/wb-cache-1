40|$|Abstract. For many genes, ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) {{have two}} paralogous copies, where only one {{ortholog}} {{is present in}} tetrapods. The discovery of an additional, almost-complete set of Hox clusters in teleosts (zebrafish, pufferfish, medaka, and cichlid) but not in basal actinopterygian lineages (Polypterus) led to the formulation of the fish-specific genome duplication hypothesis. The phylogenetic timing of this genome duplication during the evolution of rayfinned fish is unknown, since only a few species of basal fish lineages have been investigated so far. In this study, three nuclear genes (fzd 8, sox 11, tyrosinase) were sequenced from sturgeons (<b>Acipenseriformes),</b> gars (Semionotiformes), bony tongues (Osteoglossomorpha), and a tenpounder (Elopomorpha). For these three genes, two copies have been described previously teleosts (e. g., zebrafish, pufferfish), but only one orthologous copy is found in tetrapods. Individual gene trees for these three genes and a concatenated dataset {{support the hypothesis that}} the fish-specific genome duplication event took place after the split of the <b>Acipenseriformes</b> and the Semionotiformes from the lineage leading to teleost fish but before the divergence of Osteoglossiformes.

40|$|Elasmobranchii and <b>Acipenseriformes</b> are two ancient, yet highly derived {{groups of}} {{cartilaginous}} fishes with trophic dynamics ranging from planktivore to carnivore, habitat distributions {{ranging from the}} northern hemisphere to circumglobal, and widely varied reproductive strategies. Although largely structurally similar to other vertebrates, they exhibit a unique adaptation within the alimentary canal found only in ‘primitive’ fishes, the spiral valve intestine. In both groups, physiological functions of the alimentary canal are consistent with primary digestion {{taking place in the}} cardiac stomach and primary absorption taking place in the spiral valve intestine. A key difference in the alimentary canal between Elasmobranchii and <b>Acipenseriformes</b> is the presence of a well-developed pyloric caecum in the latter. Although the number of turns in the spiral valve is species specific, the effect of the structure is to increase the surface area of the spiral intestine by at least 3 -fold compared to a linear intestine of the same physical length. Additionally, although exhibiting very different modes of reproduction, both groups require a great deal of space within the body cavity for reproduction thus limiting space available for the organs of the alimentary canal.

A comparative analysis of the digestive system of examples of Subclass Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) to Order <b>Acipenseriformes</b> (sturgeon and paddlefish) was conducted through gross dissection and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Urobatis jamaicensis, Acipenser baerii, and Polyodon spathula were used due to accessibility. Gross dissection analysis yielded that the acipenserids have a columnar spiral valve with 8 infoldings, and U. jamaicensis has a posterior spiral valve with 13 infoldings.

However, the evolutionary history of androgen receptor (AR) gene remains largely unknown {{on the basis}} of phylogenic and functional analyses. To elucidate the evolutionary history and functional diversification of AR genes in vertebrates, we cloned the AR cDNAs from a shark, basal ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii), namely bichir and sturgeon (<b>Acipenseriformes),</b> and teleosts including a basal teleost, arowana (Osteoglossiformes). Molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that the gene duplication event that gave rise to two different teleost ARs (α and β) likely occurred in the actinopterygian lineage leading to teleosts after the divergence of <b>Acipenseriformes</b> but before the split of Osteoglossiformes, which is compatible with the phylogenetic timing of teleost-specific genome duplication. Searching for AR genes in the medaka genome indicated that the teleost AR gene duplication has been associated with the duplication between chromosomes 10 and 14. Our functional analysis revealed that the shark AR activates the target gene via androgen response element by classical androgens. The teleost ARα showed the unique intracellular localization with a significantly higher transactivating capacity than that by teleost ARβ. These findings indicate that the most ancient type of AR, as activated by the classical androgens as ligands, emerged before the Chondrichthyes-Osteichthyes split, and the AR gene was duplicated during the teleost-specific genome duplication event.

We show that such knowledge is fragmented and incomplete {{when compared to the}} information available in teleost fish. In <b>Acipenseriformes,</b> we only know that (i) the axial skeleton morphology is highly distinctive, as mostly cartilaginous, (ii) the vertebrae are composed of several elements organized around a persistent and unconstricted notochord, and (iii) mineralization only concerns a few of these elements and occurs late in ontogeny, but virtually no descriptions demonstrating the presence of bone (perichondral, membranous [...] .) or mineralized cartilage is available in the literature. In addition, few studies concern axial anomalies in the wild or in rearing conditions, and the determinism of these pathologies is largely unknown. This is in contrast with the numerous studies dealing with the axial skeleton and its anomalies in many farmed teleost species, in which axial anomalies can result from numerous factors, such as unfavourable abiotic conditions, inappropriate nutrition and genetic factors. However, even if some parallels can be established between teleosts and sturgeons, it appears that current {{knowledge of}} the axial skeleton in teleosts may not help much in the study of axial anomalies in sturgeons.
