[...] The following day, he was questioned by authorities before being released on bail of 15,000 Egyptian pounds. The event sparked international media attention as well as a segment on Jon Stewart's The Daily Show in which he declared his support for Youssef, calling him a [...] "friend" [...] and [...] "brother" [...] and saying to Morsi: [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>worried</b> about?

50|$|Supposedly {{unable to}} face this humiliation any more, Li was said by his {{tormentors}} to have committed suicide by taking sleeping pills after finishing a final letter to Mao. Li's biographer, Patrick Lescot, has {{cast doubt on the}} nature of Li's death. Li Sishen (李思慎), Li Lisan's personal secretary, later wrote he did not believe it possible Li Lisan could have had access to sufficient pills to kill himself. Li Sishen had been responsible for overseeing the issuing of the sleeping pills. He recalled arguing with Li Lisan, who wanted an extra pill each night as the struggle sessions were affecting his sleep. Li Lisan dismissed the notion he might kill himself as ridiculous:这简直是笑话，几十年风风火火我都过来了，难道还经不起这次考验？你不就怕我自杀吗？自杀是叛党行为，这点我明白，难道我能走上叛党的道路吗？简直是笑话。That's just a joke! I've made it through all these decades of strife and turmoil and you think I can't get through this? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>worried</b> I'll kill myself? Suicide would mean betraying the Party, I know that well enough; am I going to turn renegade against the Party? It's simply laughable.In 1980 the central Organisation Department finally allowed Li Lisan's family to read his autopsy report; this listed his height incorrectly by 15 cm and contained other errors which added to the family's doubts over the accepted version of Li's death.|$|E

Sometimes it’s easy for parents to feel like their {{children}} are more tech savvy than is good for them. However, children are growing up surrounded by technology—it’s second nature to them to know how to use it, even if you don’t have a computer at home. What is most important is for you to teach your child how to treat other people and be safe at all times—whether they are meeting to play in the neighborhood or meeting online. Here a few simple ideas that will get you a long way toward teaching your child to be safe online: Keep the conversation open.

40|$|Open-ended {{questions}} have routinely {{been included in}} large-scale survey and panel studies, yet there is some perplexity about how to actually incorporate the answers to such questions into quantitative social science research. Tools developed recently {{in the domain of}} natural language processing offer a wide range of options for the automated analysis of such textual data, but their implementation has lagged behind. In this study, we demonstrate straightforward procedures that can be applied to process and analyze textual data for the purposes of quantitative social science research. Using more than 35, 000 textual answers to the question "What else <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>worried</b> about?" from participants of the German Socio-economic Panel Study (SOEP), we (1) analyzed characteristics of respondents that determined whether they answered the open-ended question, (2) used the textual data to detect relevant topics that were reported by the respondents, and (3) linked the features of the respondents to the worries they reported in their textual data. The potential uses as well as the limitations of the automated analysis of textual data are discussed...|$|E
