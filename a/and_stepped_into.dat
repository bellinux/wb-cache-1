Some men in life jackets, jumped overboard from the starboard side and broke their necks, others walked {{down the side of the}} hull, where they could see the men trapped inside through portholes <b>and</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the water as the ship settled. Once in the water, they were strafed by German bombers, which also dropped flares on patches of oil and burned alive some of the shipwrecked men. While Lancastria was on its side, the hull was covered by men who could not swim, singing Roll Out the Barrel until they sank with the ship, about fifteen minutes after the bombing.
