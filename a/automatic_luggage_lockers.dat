5000|$|The Lloyd Alexander was {{identical}} to the Lloyd 600 in most respects, but {{in place of the}} three speed transmission of the 600, the Alexander featured a four-speed gear-box (and a higher final drive ratio). The Alexander was offered, in parallel with the 600, between 1957 and 1961. [...] One difference visible from the outside was that the Alexander included an opening hatch into the rear <b>luggage</b> <b>locker,</b> whereas drivers of the 600 had to reach behind the rear seat in order to access the <b>luggage</b> <b>locker.</b>|$|R
50|$|Offered with wider {{let-down}} cockpit {{doors and}} an enlarged <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> behind the rear cockpit. The luxury version also featured a state-of-the-art 1930's style two-color paint scheme for the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|In the Osthalle {{there is}} a service point for the InterCity courier service (IC-Kurierdienst) and a <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> room with 766 lockers. On the station {{forecourt}} {{there is a}} taxicab stand.|$|R
50|$|Passenger {{facilities}} available include: exchange office, {{lost property}} office, <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers,</b> baby changing area, health centre and various shops. A business centre is available too. There are 1,500 parking spaces for {{long and short}} term parking.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} was considered [...] "surprisingly" [...] spacious for {{this class of}} car, with plenty of space for four, although the <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> under the front hood/bonnet offered only limited space: unlike the similarly configured competitor Renault Dauphine and Renault 8 (and Simca's own prototypes for the Simca 1000) which stowed their spare wheels flat underneath the front <b>luggage</b> <b>locker,</b> the Simca 1000 had its spare wheel stowed vertically in the front luggage compartment, just behind the front bumper. The driver enjoyed an excellent view out: the speedometer pod and minor controls positioned ahead of the driver were basic, although the manufacturer stressed that the glass covering the speedometer was angled to minimize reflections.|$|R
50|$|Amongst the {{facilities}} {{of the station}} are a police station, cash machines, cafés, bars, food stands, a bakery, a supermarket (Aperto), newsagents, a media shop (CityDisc), a cybercafe, kiosks, underground car park, an underground shopping arcade, toilets and showers, and <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Coin-operated public <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers</b> can {{be present}} in bus {{stations}} and rail stations. In some countries they were commonplace from the 1950s to the 1970s, but eliminated for concern that bombs may be hidden in them. Some airports have also removed them for this reason.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} on a raised viaduct {{running in a}} roughly north-south direction. There are two exits, the north exit (北口) and south exit (南口). Both exits have ticket vending {{machines}} and toilets; however, the north exit has a Midori no Madoguchi staffed ticket office and escalators to the platforms. <b>Luggage</b> <b>lockers</b> {{are available at the}} south exit.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{engine bay}} had {{originally}} been designed to take the four-stroke air-cooled two-cylinder engine from the NSU Prinz. The rotary unit was much more compact which permitted a shallow <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> to be placed above it. This compensated for reduction in luggage space {{at the front of}} the car due to the installation there of the radiator.|$|R
5000|$|The L-1049H flew on November 20, 1956. Called [...] "Super H" [...] and [...] "Husky", the L-1049H was a {{convertible}} passenger/freight aircraft, mating a C-121C-based fuselage with L-1049G components. The cargo hold had {{a volume of}} 565 ft³ (16 m³) when including the lower hold. The aircraft could carry up to 120 people with seats, <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers</b> and toilets all available along with the option of decorating {{the walls of the}} aircraft. When not in use, the <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers</b> and seats could be stowed in the lower hold. The aircraft entered service with QANTAS a month later. Some L-1049G and H aircraft in later production were fitted with the TC-18EA series engines used on the L-1649 Starliner. A final variant was planned in 1957, known as the L-1049J. Powered by four R-3350-988-TC-18EA-6 engines, the L-1049J was based on the L-1049H with the wings of the R7V-2 Constellation and an extra fuselage-mounted fuel tank.|$|R
40|$|Speed Services AB {{produce and}} sell <b>Luggage</b> <b>Lockers,</b> Photo Booths and modernterminal kiosks to provide certain {{requirements}} as deposit luggage, make passportphotos {{and use the}} internet in public areas. Speed Services are leading at the Swedishmarket in those three areas and their products are mostly located at train stations,airports and shopping malls. The <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers</b> focused on by this thesis project are today available in threedifferent sizes, Large, Medium and Ski. The Large locker contains three boxes withthe interior measurements 820 / 600 / 460 (depth/height/width) in mm. The Mediumlocker contains four boxes with the measurements (570 / 440 / 360) and the Ski lockercontain one box with the measurement (570 / 1880 / 198, 4). The thesis project was initiated {{to develop a new}} version of these lockers that areenable to adapt the number of boxes to the requirements from the customers, have alower weight and be easy to apply maintenance. During the project one assembly ofthe shelf and one assembly of the door was ordered from current distributor tovalidate the durability. The concepts that was developed during the project wereevaluated and discussed with the supervisor before the best concept was chosen. As a result of this thesis work a new adaptive <b>Luggage</b> <b>Locker</b> was developed whereall components are available to change. The components that previously needed to bechanged due to wear and sabotage will now be easier to change. The weight goal toreduce the total weight on the lockers with 30 % were achieved because the totalweight reduction was approximately 50 %...|$|R
5000|$|The station {{building}} today hosts {{a passport}} control and customs office, which are open when trains to/from Russia depart/arrive. The waiting hall is open during daytime, {{but has no}} facilities, such as <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers,</b> WC nor a ticket office (the nearby bus station has a toilet but no left luggage service). Access to platforms is only possible in conjunction with train departures and arrivals.|$|R
50|$|In 1978 a {{combination}} lock {{which could be}} set by the user to a sequence of his own choosing was invented by Andrew Elliot Rae. At this time the electronic keypad was invented and {{he was unable to}} get any manufacturers to back his mechanical lock for <b>lockers,</b> <b>luggage,</b> or brief-cases. The silicon chip locks never became popular due to the need for battery power to maintain their integrity. The patent expired and the original mechanical invention was instantly manufactured and sold worldwide mainly for <b>luggage,</b> <b>lockers,</b> and hotel safes. It is now a standard part of the luggage used by travellers.|$|R
50|$|The F 5 was a low-wing tandem two-seat {{monoplane}} which {{retained the}} fabric-covered steel-tube fuselage {{of the earlier}} Fieseler F 4 but introduced a new two-spar cantilever wing. It had a fixed conventional landing gear with a tail-skid and the tandem open-cockpit were fitted with dual-controls. Behind the rear seat was a large <b>luggage</b> <b>locker,</b> the top decking at the rear could be removed to carry a spare propeller or skis.|$|R
50|$|In October 1965, detectives who had arrested Ian Brady for {{the murder}} of 17-year-old Edward Evans in Hattersley {{discovered}} evidence in a left <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> at the station which connected them to the disappearances of two missing children, who were soon discovered to have been murdered by Brady and his accomplice Myra Hindley in the widely reported Moors murders, in which at least five children and teenagers were murdered.|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} {{at the end of}} April 1955, and it was noted that the existing Continental model would continue. The new standard steel saloon replaced the R type standard steel saloon which had been in production, with modifications, since 1946. It was a more generously sized five- or six-seater saloon with the body manufactured in pressed steel with stressed skin construction. Doors, bonnet and <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> lid were of aluminium.|$|R
50|$|The main {{entrance}} of the station leads directly to the station lobby. In the southwestern part of the lobby, there are a FotoFix automat and two pay phones; in the southern half (with its own access) are <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers,</b> ticket machines, the toilet and the DB travel centre. In the north-west wing is a candy kiosk and in the eastern half an ATM, a bakery / café and a newsagent.|$|R
2500|$|The station {{building}} {{features a}} heated waiting room, a café and kiosk, {{as well as}} <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers,</b> washrooms and ticket vending machines. It also hosts a staff canteen. Ticket sale is offered at the Narvesen kiosk. There is parking for 222 cars about [...] from the station. A bus station and taxi stand are located south of the station, while there is bicycle parking to the north. The station is located [...] from the Norwegian Railway Museum.|$|R
50|$|The Lloyd 600/Alexander body offered {{accommodation}} in {{the passenger}} cabin for four adults, but access to the rear seat was difficult and space cramped, with {{the width of the}} back seat reduced by the space taken up by the rear wheel arches. There was more space at the front, although there were criticisms that the steering wheel was too close to the driver. The <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> at the back had a total computed capacity of 104 litres.|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{launched}} with a 6-cylinder in-line Sleeve valve engine of 2,344 cc, {{placing it in}} the 13CV car tax band. The factory bodied [...] "CS Type X68" [...] four door sedan/saloon/berline offered seating for 4/5 people and had a separate <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> at the back. There were also various coupé and Cabriolet bodied cars produced. By 1932, when the [...] "Type X68" [...] {{gave way to the}} [...] "Type X72", 1,028 of the former had been produced.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005 Nuremberg Airport {{celebrated its}} 50th anniversary with 45,000 visitors. The new {{transfer}} control terminal with a floor space of [...] {{and a new}} main gate (Tor 1) were completed a year later in 2006. In addition, a fully <b>automatic</b> <b>luggage</b> sorting system was put into operation.|$|R
2500|$|The M62 coach bombing {{occurred}} on 4 February 1974 on the M62 motorway in northern England, when a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb exploded in a coach carrying off-duty British Armed Forces personnel {{and their family}} members. Twelve people (nine soldiers, three civilians) {{were killed by the}} bomb, which consisted of [...] of high explosive hidden in a <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> on the coach. Later in 1974 Judith Ward was convicted of the crime, but 18 years later the conviction was judged as wrongful and she was released from prison.|$|R
2500|$|The Mouse was a low-wing {{monoplane}} touring aircraft, {{powered by}} a 130hp (97kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major piston engine. Construction was mainly of fabric-covered spruce wood frames, with some plywood-covered sections. It had folding wings, retractable main landing gear and fixed tailskid. Accommodation was for the pilot and two passengers, accessible via a sliding framed canopy, plus an additional <b>luggage</b> <b>locker.</b> The first flight of the Mouse was at Heston aerodrome on 11 September 1933, piloted by Nick Comper. In February 1934, it was assessed at A Martlesham Heath, leading to various small design changes ...|$|R

50|$|The {{doors were}} hinged {{on the rear}} edge which {{facilitated}} access and egress. The windows in the doors slid open horizontally which avoided the need for costly and bulky winder mechanisms in the doors of what was, even {{by the standards of}} the time, a narrow car. The hood/bonnet lid was considered very narrow, and was broadened at the end of 1951. There was no opening hatch for the <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> at the back of the car, which instead had to be accessed by reaching behind the back seat.|$|R
2500|$|In his 2003 memoir The Bright Shapes and the True Names, Patrick McCaughey {{wrote that}} {{a few days before}} the {{painting}} was recovered, a Melbourne art dealer called him to say that a young artist may know something about the theft. [...] When he visited the artist's studio, McCaughey writes, he made a point to say that he was interested in the return of the painting, not a conviction for the crime: [...] "I said deliberately, at least twice, that the people who had taken the work could deposit it in a <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> at Spencer Street railway station or at Tullamarine Airport." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} part of a single {{assembly}} including its clutch and gearbox. This assembly was held at three points in [...] "live rubber" [...] with a steadying bearing forward of the flywheel. Suspension was by long semi-elliptic springs at each corner of the car controlled by Luvax shock absorbers combined with a front (anti-roll) torsion bar. The chassis was mounted on large section tyres. Spare wheel and tyre were stowed in a separate compartment below the <b>luggage</b> <b>locker.</b> Permanent hydraulic jacks were built into the chassis. Both springs and frame pass beneath the back axle.|$|R

50|$|The US$3 million {{airport was}} {{constructed}} in 3 months in 2003 {{to meet the needs}} of investors to bring equipment and to export crops. It occupies 36 square kilometres, with a main runway of 3500m and an apron that can serve 8 aircraft. A simple terminal building can serve passengers at a rate of 100 per hour. No <b>automatic</b> <b>luggage</b> conveyor is provided inside the terminal.|$|R
50|$|The {{passenger}} hall has {{underfloor heating}} from a groundwater heat pump. Wind towers and louvres draw {{air into the}} hall and air curtains prevent fumes getting in. Each bus route has an area within the interchange, buses being automatically directed to a stop in that area. Doors to the hall open once the bus stops and another door at the front allows cyclists to access bus bike racks. Although pedestrians aren't permitted in the bus manoeuvering area, bus speeds are restricted. Cycle racks for 100 bicycles are on two levels and there are e-bike chargers. There are also toilets, <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers</b> and an information counter. Tactile paving guides sight impaired passengers. A large canopy and verandas provide shelter outside.|$|R
5000|$|The basic Admiral {{was offered}} as a four-door [...] "Limousine" [...] (sedan/saloon) with a manufacturer's listed price of 6,500 Reichmarks which was {{considered}} very competitive. There was also a four-door cabriolet listed at 7,000 Reichsmarks. Customers wishing {{to spend more money}} for more style could choose a 2 + 2 seater cabriolet bodied Admiral from the coach builder Hebmüller of Wuppertal, listed at 8,450 Marks. Hebmüller also offered an imposing six-seater [...] "Pullman-Limousine" [...] bodied Admiral with a lengthened passenger cabin (in return for a shortened <b>luggage</b> <b>locker)</b> listed at 8,580 Marks. Other coach-built versions included a 2+2 seater cabriolet bodied by Gläser of Dresden, a car described by one commentator as [...] "dignified".|$|R
50|$|First {{appearing}} at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1964, the Spider featured a two-door cabriolet body {{based on that}} of the NSU Sport Prinz coupé introduced back in 1959. In addition to the folding roof, the Spider was distinguishable from the hard top car by a grill at the front. As with all NSU cars at the time, the engine was rear-mounted: {{in order to improve}} weight distribution, space was found for the Spider’s radiator and for its 35 L fuel tank ahead of the driver. The front <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> was in consequence small. There was a second luggage area {{in the rear of the}} car above the engine. It appears that NSU Spiders were painted either red or white.|$|R
50|$|After Ranvir drinks {{his glass}} clean during the celebration Armaan reveals that Alina mixed poison in Ranvir's glass. As Ranvir slowly dies, Armaan reveals that thanks to RD he knew Ranvir's plan {{the whole time}} and he was {{controlling}} the race the entire time. Alina reveals that she was never on his side because of her blood relationship with Armaan. Omisha drives back with the money and reveals to Ranvir that she was also on Armaan's side {{and she is not}} Sonia's sister. After Ranvir dies, RD and Cherry leave after getting 10% of the money from Armaan. Alina leaves to get the private jet ready, while Armaan and Omisha retrieve what they believe to be the real shroud Shroud from Ranvir's <b>luggage</b> <b>locker.</b>|$|R
2500|$|By 1964, she {{was calling}} her artistic {{expressions}} of the proverbial everywoman Nanas, after a French slang word that is roughly equivalent to [...] "broad", or [...] "chick". The first of these freely-posed forms—made of papier-mâché, yarn, and cloth—were exhibited at the Alexander Iolas Gallery in Paris in September 1965. For this show, Iolas published Saint Phalle's first artist book that included her handwritten text in combination with her drawings of Bananas. During this show, she joined a type of tombola raffle organized by the Artist's Club of New York, whereby artworks were randomly left in coin-operated <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers</b> at Pennsylvania Station, and keys were offered for $10 each. Encouraged by Iolas, she started a highly productive output of graphic work that accompanied exhibitions which included silk-screened prints, posters, books, and writings.|$|R
