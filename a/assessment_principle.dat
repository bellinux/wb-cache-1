5000|$|QIIME [...] (an {{abbreviation}} for Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology) is a bioinformatic pipeline designated {{for the task}} of analysing microbial communities that were sampled through marker gene (e.g. 16S or 18S rRNA genes) amplicon sequencing.In its heart the pipeline performs quality control over the input sequencing reads, clusters the marker gene nucleotidesequences at a requested phylogenetic level (e.g. 97% for species level) into OTUs (operational taxonomic units) and taxonomically annotates the OTUs by looking for sequences similar to them on a reference taxonomic database. The main output from the QIIME pipeline is the OTU table, which describes the microbial OTUs and their abundances {{in each of the}} samples. Additional tools that are relevant to ecological aspects of the samples being investigated are also provided within the pipeline, including rarefaction, beta diversity <b>assessment,</b> <b>principle</b> coordinates analysis (PCoA) and much more.QIIME presents a very modular approach and allows multiple methods to be applied in many stages of the analysis. For example,the stage of sequences clustering can be performed using either UCLUST, CD-HIT, BLAST and more.QIIME is under active development since its release in 2010.|$|E

Basically, assessment for lecturers is not a novelty. Assessment is important since it is done in every learning process. It is necessary to be done because the result of assessment can be used as one of the standards of learners’ competency in understanding the material. Number and value can be used as the standard of learning success since they are the characteristics of the assessment. In doing the assessment of learning outcomes, the lecturers should notice the assessment principles as the qualified assessments guidelines. The assessment principles which are needed to be actualized in the assessment of learning outcomes in speaking ability are validation principle, competence education, objective, fair, open, continuity, comprehensive and economical. Based on the reality, some speaking ability’s assessment principles in higher education have not fully actualized yet.   The effort to realize the speaking ability’s <b>assessment</b> <b>principle</b> in higher education is by doing assessment based on information technology.

Then, using regression equations, we have tried to predict beliefs about student retention using other categories of beliefs. Finally, we conducted cluster analyses in order to identify groups of teachers, distinguishable by the nature of their beliefs. Two major results emerge from these analyses. On the one hand, it appears that the awareness of research on the effects of repetition influences teachers’ beliefs about this practice. On the other hand, contrary to our assumptions, the other categories of beliefs do not seem to affect teachers’ beliefs about student retention.

40|$|International {{audience}} 3 D meshes {{are subject}} to various visual distortions during their transmission and geometrical processing. Several works have tried to evaluate the visual quality using either full reference or reduced reference approaches. However, these approaches require {{the presence of the}} reference mesh which is not available in such practical situations. In this paper, the main contribution lies in the design of a computational method to automatically predict the perceived mesh quality without reference and without knowing beforehand the distortion type. Following the no-reference (NR) quality <b>assessment</b> <b>principle,</b> the proposed method focuses only on the distorted mesh. Specifically, the dihedral angles are firstly computed as a surface roughness indexes and so a structural information descriptors. Then, a visual masking modulation is applied to this angles according to the main characteristics of the human visual system. The well known statistical Gamma model is used to fit the dihedral angles distribution. Finally, the estimated parameters of the model are learned to the support vector regression (SVR) in order to predict the quality score. Experimental results demonstrate the highly competitive performance of the proposed no-reference method relative to the most influential methods for mesh quality assessment...|$|E

According to the guidelines of social life cycle assessment, especially well-being {{should be considered as}} the main area of protection to assess social impacts of products. In addition, equity and equality need to be addressed in terms of social justice to ensure a fair and ethic society. However, even if a lot of studies focused on the definition social indicators to assess resulting impacts, neither have scientific or common agreements been founded to define a valid set of indicators, nor have consistent pathways from inventory towards impact indicators been established. This work, therefore, proposes possible pathways from life cycle inventory to impact assessment of two social midpoint categories: fair wage and level of education.

40|$|AbstractThe {{method of}} {{ecosystem}} health assessment (EHA) {{based on an}} index system using thermodynamic indicators {{has been applied to}} assess the state of health of Baiyangdian Lake. Indicators consisting of eco-exergy, structural eco-exergy, ratio of zooplankton biomass to phytoplankton biomass, and phytoplankton biomass were selected for the ecosystem health characterization. The <b>assessment</b> <b>principle</b> has been modified based on the typical characteristics of current ecological conditions for water areas in Baiyangdian Lake. The results of the health assessment indicate that water areas in sites 4 and 14 are in relatively good health, while the states of health of other water areas are deteriorated to varying degrees. By comparing the values of the ratio of zooplankton biomass to phytoplankton biomass and structural eco-exergy, the order of relative states of health from good to bad has been determined as: water area in the northeast and southeast (A) > water area in the north (D) > water area in the central and south (C) > water area in the west (B). Furthermore, based on the distribution of human disturbances in the water areas, for proposed regulating measures to improve the health of the impaired water areas we focus mainly on decreasing the nutrient loadings in water areas B and C and the submerged plant management of water area D...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{provides}} {{a summary of}} the issues associated with the emergency triage of clients who have a mental illness in order to demonstrate the complexity inherent in contempory emergency triage practice to this client group. Procedures: A review and analysis of English language peer reviewed literature and research was undertaken. Findings: Since 1993 there have been a range of initiatives implemented in Australian emergency departments that were aimed at improving the assessment and management of clients presenting with a mental illness. The assessment and subsequent response for clients presenting with a mental illness are highly variable. Currently the terminology related to mental health emergency triage is poorly defined. Many improvements in mental health service delivery have been acknowledged as beneficial to staff and clients in emergency departments. Despite this there remains a dearth of literature about mental health services operating within the specific time constructs as prescribed by the Australasian Triage Scale. Recent research suggests that the mental health descriptors within the Australasian Triage Scale may not be a reliable tool for accurate mental health triage <b>assessment.</b> <b>Principle</b> conclusions: These assertions suggest there is an imperative for further research into the practices and processes that underpin the emergency triage of, and response to, clients who have a mental illness and who present to an emergency department...|$|E
