5|$|In 1901 he was {{appointed}} as {{a research fellow at}} the Royal Frederick University. He rarely had responsibility for any teaching of the students, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> was often busy with Norsk Forfatter-lexikon he remained a research fellow until 1907. In 1908 he took his dr.philos. degree on the thesis Die Stellung Norwegens und Schwedens im Deutsch-Dänischen Konflikt 1863–1864.

5|$|While filming Diamonds Are Forever, Live and Let Die {{was chosen}} as the next Ian Fleming novel to be adapted because screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz thought it would be daring to use black villains, as the Black Panthers and other racial {{movements}} were active at this time. Guy Hamilton was again chosen to direct, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> was a jazz fan, Mankiewicz suggested he film in New Orleans. Hamilton did not want to use Mardi Gras since Thunderball featured Junkanoo, a similar festivity, so after more discussions with the writer and location scouting with helicopters, he decided to use two well-known features of the city, the jazz funerals and the canals.|$|E

25|$|The loss of Freyr's sword has consequences. According to the Prose Edda, Freyr had {{to fight}} Beli without his sword and slew him with an antler.

25|$|Harold Holt is {{most famously}} commemorated by the Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre in the Melbourne suburb of Glen Iris. The complex was under {{construction}} {{at the time}} of Holt's disappearance, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> was the local member, it was named in his memory. The irony of commemorating a man who is presumed to have drowned with a swimming pool has been a wry source of amusement to many Australians.|$|E
25|$|When he was {{in grade}} school, {{he was accused of}} {{stealing}} Miles Edgeworth's lunch money, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> was in a small school, there was a class trial. During the trial, Edgeworth and Larry Butz stood up for Wright, saying the teacher and students had no evidence of Wright's guilt. The class trial was dismissed and the three students became best friends until Edgeworth moved away following his father's murder. Fifteen years later, Larry would reveal that {{he was the one who}} stole Edgeworth's money that day, paying it back in full. While Wright is surprised, Edgeworth gives the appearance that he knew Larry stole his money all along.|$|E
25|$|He closely {{followed}} {{reports on the}} Battle of Britain and the role played in it by Polish RAF squadrons, especially by the legendary No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron. He became concerned that the US did not have many experienced fighter pilots. This gave him an idea: since Polish squadrons had proved to be capable within the RAF <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> himself was of Polish origin and spoke Polish, he offered {{to serve as a}} liaison officer to the Polish squadrons to learn from their experience. The idea was approved, and he left Hawaii for Washington, D.C. in September 1942, where he was promoted to captain.|$|E

25|$|The {{governor}} protested, {{claiming that}} he had not expected such action. He accused the lieutenant of treachery, as the Americans had come ashore under a flag of truce, before making the Spaniards prisoners of war. Braunersreuther replied that he had merely been instructed to deliver a letter <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> was now in possession of an offer of complete surrender, the Americans were permitted to make any demand they wished. The Spanish officials were allowed to write letters to their families. Afterward, Marina and his staff were taken to City of Sydney after sending an order to Agana for the Spanish soldiery and native militia to be at Piti landing no later than four o'clock that afternoon.|$|E
25|$|At first, Alfred is {{the prime}} suspect. He has the most to gain financially from his wife's death, <b>and,</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> is much younger than Emily was, the Cavendishes already suspect him as a fortune hunter. Evelyn Howard, Emily's companion, seems to hate him. His {{behaviour}} is suspicious; he openly purchased strychnine in the village before Emily was poisoned, and although he denies it, he refuses to provide an alibi. Inspector Japp is keen to arrest him, but Poirot intervenes by proving {{he could not have}} purchased the poison. Inspector Japp arrests John Cavendish. He inherits under the terms of her will, and there is evidence to suggest he had obtained poison.|$|E
25|$|Stupar {{was found}} guilty in the first {{instance}} verdict, of 29 July 2009, but the Appellate Panel of the Section I for War Crimes, by its verdict on 9 September 2009, modified the trial verdict in its sentencing part and, among other things, ordered a retrial with regards Stupar before the panel of the Appellate Division of Section I of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Appellate Division made its verdict on 5 May 2010 by which it had acquired Stupar of all charges, since he was not de facto or de jure Commander of the 2nd Šekovići Detachment of the Special Police <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> did not have the effective control over the perpetrators of the crimes.|$|E

25|$|On 1 May 1787, Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne, {{archbishop}} of Toulouse {{and one of}} the queen's political allies, was appointed by the king at her urging to replace Calonne, first as Controller-General of Finances and then as Prime Minister. He began to institute more cutbacks at court, while trying to restore the royal absolute power weakened by parliament. However, Brienne was unable to improve the financial situation, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> was the queen's ally, this failure adversely affected her political position. The continued poor financial climate of the country resulted in the 25 May dissolution of the Assembly of Notables because of its inability to function, and the lack of solutions was blamed on the queen.|$|E
25|$|On July 30, 2007, {{the media}} {{reported}} that Jones {{was working on}} a deal with the professional wrestling promotion, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>he</b> had a one-year suspension from the NFL, he had more time on his hands to pursue other interests. As the news circulated, Titans coach Jeff Fisher stated that his football contract could preclude him from actually wrestling with the company, but negotiations continued for a non-wrestling role. On August 6, TNA confirmed through their website that a deal had been signed, and afterwards interviews with Jones and Jeff Jarrett, one of TNA's Vice Presidents, indicated that he did intend to wrestle, primarily as part of a tag team.|$|E

After a pause to regroup, Rosecrans moved his army again on August 16, 1863 across the Cumberland Plateau to the Tennessee River and Sequatchie River banks. In early September 1863, the Army of the Cumberland began to advance on Chattanooga. With Thomas's and McCook's corps threatening his supply lines, Bragg evacuated Chattanooga on September 8, 1863. On September 10, 1863, the Regular Brigade crossed the Tennessee River at Bridgeport, Alabama with General King in command. Captain Albert B.
