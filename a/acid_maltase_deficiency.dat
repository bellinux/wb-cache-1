Solubility of the neutral maltase was not accounted for by the action of endogenous proteinases under the preparative conditions used.

In this thesis a generalized form and a muscular form are distinguished. The generalized form is a progressive disease of infancy. It {{is characterized by}} a failure to thrive, cardiorespiratory difficulties and weakness with hypotonia, and leads to death within {{the first two years of}} life. The muscular form may occur in childhood or even in adults. It causes a slowly progressive myopathy which is ultimately fatal, usually because of respiratory insufficiency. Despite the wide variability in clinical manifestations, one and the same enzyme, lysosomal <b>acid</b> <b>maltase,</b> is deficient in both forms. The present study was prompted by two circumstances. The first was an exceptional combination of both clinical forms in one family: an infant suffered from the generalized form and her grandfather form the muscular form. The second reason was that data of 20 patients with this rare disorder (seven with the generalized form, and 13 with the muscular form) were available for study.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the expression of}} the cytoskeletal proteins dystrophin and beta-spectrin on vacuolar boundaries in vacuolar myopathies. We also localized utrophin, a dystrophin homologue, and laminin, which served as a marker for the basal lamina. Four types of vacuoles were identified. Type 1 vacuoles, found in all diseases, were lined by laminin, dystrophin, and beta-spectrin and arose from infoldings of the basal lamina and sarcolemma into splitting or branching fibers. Type 2 vacuoles were lined by dystrophin and beta-spectrin and were most common in adult <b>acid</b> <b>maltase</b> <b>deficiency,</b> chloroquine myopathy, and periodic paralysis. Traces of utrophin were also noted on the boundaries of some type 2 vacuoles, but only in those fibers that also expressed utrophin on their surface membrane. Type 3 vacuoles were lined by small patches of dystrophin and beta-spectrin and occurred in any vacuolar myopathy. Type 4 vacuoles were unlined by any of the above antigens and were most common in infantile <b>acid</b> <b>maltase</b> <b>deficiency</b> and in the nonlysosomal glycogenoses.

40|$|Michael BeckChildren&rsquo;s Hospital, University of Mainz, Mainz, GermanyAbstract: Pompe {{disease is}} a {{lysosomal}} storage disorder characterized by muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. It shows a broad variability regarding the clinical severity {{as well as the}} age of onset. In the past, two different recombinant enzyme preparations have been developed for the treatment of Pompe patients: &alpha;-glucosidase, produced in rabbit milk, and &alpha;-glucosidase, produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. The CHO enzyme received marketing approval in 2006 after it was proven to be effective in ameliorating muscle strength and improving heart function. The other has not been approved. The clinical efficacy of this enzyme preparation could be confirmed by several clinical trials in patients with different age of onset and disease severity. Enzyme replacement therapy, however, has its limitations due to unsatisfactory access of recombinant &alpha;-glucosidase to the muscle cells and due to the formation of antibodies. To overcome these therapeutic restraints, the development of a more effective enzyme preparation may become necessary.

Age of presentation in males ranges from infancy to the second decade and affected males rarely survive beyond their 20  s and die secondary to an arrhythmia or congestive cardiac failure [29]. Female carriers develop cardiomyopathy during adulthood, most commonly in the 4 th or 5 th decades. Both skeletal myopathy and mental retardation are less common in females [30]. Wolff-Parkinson-White, increased serum creatinine kinase and ophthalmic abnormalities are also seen in Danon disease [31, 32]. Mutations in the lysosome-associated protein 2 (LAMP- 2) have been identified as the causative gene [31]. LAMP- 2 is a heavily glycosated protein found inside the lysosomal membrane.
