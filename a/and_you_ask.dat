There {{are many}} hidden costs in a mutual housing project - {{especially}} {{related to the}} public works being provided by the Federal Works Administration (FWA) - which make each unit far more expensive than indicated, and far {{in excess of the}} maximum allowable dollar amount specified by the Lanham Act. Senator Shelton stated that, [...] "..if you put in a public housing job by Lanham funds, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> the cost of it, and it comes to $3200 a unit, the public housing sponsors do not count in the FWA that did the excavations and the landscaping and we do not count the sewers that are $8 a running foot, and if it was all counted in and it was properly appraised and capitalized, the structure would cost $5000..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Originally, Pink {{wanted to}} call her album Heartbreak Is a Motherfucker, but her record label {{declined}} because of a fear that offensive language would affect sales. She also said {{that she did not}} want the album to look like a break-up album; [...] "There is a lot of that , but there is fun happening too and that's why I named it Funhouse in the end." [...] Pink has also stated that she sees life as a carnival: [...] "Clowns are supposed to be happy, but they are really scary. Carnivals are supposed to be fun, but really they are kind of creepy." [...] "and that's like life to me, and love. Love is supposed to be fun, but it can sometimes be really scary. And the funhouse mirrors that make you look so distorted that you don’t recognize yourself <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> yourself, ‘How did I get here? How do I get out of here?’ But, you think that {{you want to do it}} again. That is the same as love and life. It's a metaphor for being in love and for life." [...] This also shows in the title track [...] "Funhouse" [...] where she tells that it used to be fun. [...] "It's about when the box you’re in doesn’t fit anymore, burn that fucker down and start a new one." ...|$|E

6000|$|MRS GEORGE [with {{intensely}} sad reproach] When {{you loved}} me I {{gave you the}} whole sun and stars to play with.

I paid the price without bargaining: I bore the children without flinching: was that a reason for heaping fresh burdens on me? I carried the child in my arms: must I carry the father too? When I opened the gates of paradise, were you blind? was it nothing to you? When all the stars sang in your ears and all the winds swept you into the heart of heaven, were you deaf? were you dull? was I no more to you than a bone to a dog? Was it not enough? We spent eternity together; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me for a little lifetime more.
