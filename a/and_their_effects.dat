5|$|Benzodiazepines share {{a similar}} {{chemical}} structure, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>effects</b> in humans are mainly {{produced by the}} allosteric modification of a specific kind of neurotransmitter receptor, the GABAA receptor, which increases the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Other less important mechanisms of action are also known.|$|E
5|$|Detzel and Wink (1993) {{published}} an extensive review of 63 types of plant allelochemicals (alkaloids, terpenes, glycosides, etc.) <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>effects</b> on bees when consumed. It {{was found that}} 39 chemical compounds repelled bees (primarily alkaloids, coumarins, and saponins) and three terpene compounds attracted bees. They report that 17 out of 29 allelochemicals are toxic at some levels (especially alkaloids, saponins, cardiac glycosides and cyanogenic glycosides).|$|E
5|$|As {{the fields}} of ecology and {{environmental}} studies develop, exotic species attract more attention <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>effects</b> become more apparent. Mid-20th century biology texts about invading species reflected more complacency than alarm, as contemporary wisdom about them assumed the host environment would be largely immune. Everglades biologist Thomas Lodge writes that in the 1960s, evidence of non-native plant and animal life in South Florida was present but not particularly worthy of notice. Over the past decades, however, the number of exotic species and their spread has increased dramatically.|$|E

5|$|At school, Brinkley was {{introduced}} to the study of glandular extracts <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>effects</b> on the human system. He determined that this new field would help move his career forward. After two years of studies, and ever-deeper debts, Brinkley doubled his summer workload by taking two shifts at Western Union, but came home one day to find his wife and daughter gone. Sally filed for divorce and child support, but after two months of payments, Brinkley kidnapped his daughter and fled with her to Canada. Sally Brinkley, unable to obtain an extradition order from Canada, dismissed her suit for alimony and child support, allowing Brinkley to return to Chicago with the child. The couple reunited in their rocky marriage.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>effects</b> has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E
5|$|In April 1951, the Joint Chiefs of Staff drafted {{orders for}} MacArthur authorizing nuclear attacks on Manchuria and the Shantung Peninsula if the Chinese {{launched}} airstrikes originating from there against his forces.

Dean was apprehensive about delegating the decision on how they should be used to MacArthur, who lacked expert technical knowledge of the weapons <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>effects.</b> The Joint Chiefs were not entirely comfortable about giving them to MacArthur either, for fear that he might prematurely carry out his orders. Instead, they decided that the nuclear strike force would report to the Strategic Air Command.|$|E

5|$|The {{present form}} of the {{doctrine}} seems to be unchanged {{at least since the}} time of Bhadrabahu (c. 300 BCE) who is respected by both the sects. This is supported by the fact that both Svetambara and Digambara sects agree on the basic doctrine, giving indication that it reached in its present form before the schism took place. Bhadrabahu is usually seen as the last leader of united Jain sangh. Detailed codification of types of karma <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>effects</b> were attested by Umasvati who is regarded by both Digambara and Svetambara as one of theirs.|$|E

Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but are still storm-related. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave or a low. All of the damage figures are in 2010 USD (the listed damage figure is in millions).|$|E
5|$|After {{his time}} at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach {{obtained}} a position as {{an associate professor at}} Harvard Medical School's Department of Pharmacology in 1973. By 1978 he obtained tenure and became a full professor, and continued teaching at Harvard University for the next three years. After a nine-year stint at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, he returned to Harvard to serve as the Nathan Marsh Pusey Professor of Neurobiology and Chairman of the Neurobiology Departments of both Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital from 1990 to 1998. During his years as an associate professor, he researched the development of precursor muscle cells, specifically the development of acetylcholine receptors on embryonic chick pectoral muscles. Later on he continued his research on ARIA that he started at the National Institutes of Health, specifically focusing on the expression of the protein's isoforms <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>effects</b> on tyrosine kinases. In 1993, Fischbach was involved with the founding of the Mind, Brain, Behavior Institute. This inter-disciplinary program aims to research the different structures, evolution, and development of the nervous system in order to better understand human behavior.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Ed Harris {{directed}} Connelly in the biopic Pollock {{in which}} she played Ruth Kligman, Jackson Pollock's mistress. In 2000 she appeared in what critics considered her breakthrough film, Requiem for a Dream, directed by Darren Aronofsky {{and based on the}} novel of the same name by Hubert Selby, Jr. Connelly played Marion Silver, the girlfriend of Harry, played by Jared Leto; the movie also starred Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn. Her character is a middle-class girl from Manhattan Beach who pursues the dream of establishing a dress shop. She becomes addicted to heroin and descends into a life of prostitution. Connelly prepared for the role by renting an apartment in the building where the character lived. During her time in the apartment, Connelly isolated herself, painted, listened to music that she considered that her character would, designed clothes, and used the time to reflect about addictions and their origin. Connelly also talked to addicts and attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings with a friend who was in recovery. Critics acclaimed the individual performances for the actors' emotional courage in portraying physical and mental degradation. Connelly said she became interested in the script for its depiction of the addictions <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>effects</b> on the lives and affections of the characters and their relatives.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1951, the Joint Chiefs became {{alarmed by}} the build up of Soviet forces in the Far East, {{particularly}} bombers and submarines. On 5 April 1951, they drafted orders for MacArthur authorizing attacks on Manchuria and the Shantung Peninsula if the Chinese launched airstrikes against his forces originating from there.

Instead, they decided that the nuclear strike force would report to the Strategic Air Command (SAC). This time the bombers deployed with the fissile cores. SAC did not intend to attack air bases and depots; the bombers would target industrial cities in North Korea and China. Deployments of SAC bombers to Guam continued {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
