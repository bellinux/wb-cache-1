About 97% of the packages (over 90% of the total <b>activity</b> <b>inventory</b> of Asse II) originated from the Karlsruhe reprocessing plant. Some of the Karlsruhe drums contained waste from the reprocessing plant itself, and thus fissile material. Storage limits per drum were 200 grams U-235, 15 g U-233 and 15 g Pu-239. These limits were not reached. Maximum values per drum were 24 g U-235, 5.7 g Pu-239 and less than 1 g U-233 on the 511 metre level.|$|E

40|$|Purpose To {{understand}} the emotional difficulties associated with {{living with the}} ocular condition Reti-nitis Pigmentosa, and to examine the functioning of a self-report instrument used to assess this construct. Methods The difficulty of goals and tasks in the emotional health domain of the Dutch ICF <b>Activity</b> <b>Inventory</b> were rated by 166 people with Retinitis Pigmentosa in a cross-sectional study. Demographic factors were also assessed. Results Responses to the 23 emotional health tasks were Rasch analysed and {{could be used to}} form either one 20 item overview scale with some multidimensionality, or three unidimen-sional subscales addressing feelings (4 items), communicating visual loss (5 items) and fatigue (7 items).
