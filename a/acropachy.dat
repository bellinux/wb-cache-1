50|$|<b>Acropachy</b> or thyroid <b>acropachy</b> {{refers to}} a dermopathy {{associated}} with Graves' disease. It is characterized by soft-tissue swelling of the hands and clubbing of the fingers. Radiographic imaging of affected extremities typically demonstrates periostitis, most commonly the metacarpal bones. The exact cause is unknown, but it {{is thought to be}} caused by stimulating auto-antibodies that are implicated in the pathophysiology of Graves' thyrotoxicosis. There is no effective treatment for <b>acropachy.</b>|$|E

50|$|A periosteal {{reaction}} {{can result}} from {{a large number of}} causes, including injury and chronic irritation due to a medical condition such as hypertrophic osteopathy, bone healing in response to fracture, chronic stress injuries, subperiosteal hematomas, osteomyelitis, and cancer of the bone. It may also occur as part of thyroid <b>acropachy,</b> a severe sign of the autoimmune thyroid disorder Grave's disease.|$|E
50|$|Skin biopsy {{is another}} way to {{diagnose}} PDP. However, it is not a very specific method, because other diseases share the same skin alterations with PDP, such as myxedema and hypothyroidism. In order to exclude these other diseases, hormonal studies are done. For example, thyrotropin and growth hormone levels should be examined to exclude thyroid <b>acropachy</b> and acrome. However, skin biopsy helps to diagnose PDP in patients without skin manifestations. When clubbing is observed, it is helpful to check whether acroosteolysis of distal phalanges of fingers is present. This is useful to diagnose PDP, because the combination of clubbing and acroosteolysis is only found in PDP and Cheney’s syndrome.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Graves' orbitopathy (GO), thyroid dermopathy (also called pretibial myxedema) and <b>acropachy</b> are the extrathyroidal {{manifestations of}} Graves' disease. They occur in 25, 1. 5, and 0. 3 % of Graves' patients, respectively. Thus, GO {{is the main}} and most common extrathyroidal manifestation. Dermopathy is usually present if the patient is also {{affected}} with GO. The very rare <b>acropachy</b> occurs only in patients who also have dermopathy. GO and dermopathy have an autoimmune origin and are probably triggered by autoimmunity to the TSH receptor and, likely, the IGF- 1 receptor. Both GO and dermopathy may be mild to severe. Management: Mild GO usually does not require any treatment except for local measures and preventive actions (especially refraining from smoking). Currently, moderate-to-severe and active GO is best treated by systemic glucocorticoids, but response to treatment is not optimal in many instances, and retreatments and use of other modalities (glucocorticoids, orbital radiotherapy, cyclosporine) and, in the end, rehabilitative surgery are often needed. Dermopathy is usually managed by local glucocorticoid treatment. No specific treatment is available for <b>acropachy.</b> Perspectives: Novel treatments are presently being investigated for GO, and particular {{attention is paid to}} the use of rituximab. It is unknown whether novel treatments for GO might be useful for the other extrathyroidal manifestations. Future novel therapies shown to be beneficial for GO in randomized studies may be empirically used for dermopathy and <b>acropachy...</b>|$|E
40|$|A 45 {{year old}} male {{presented}} with dry skin, facial puffiness, weight gain, constipation and lethargy for five months. He {{had been diagnosed}} as thyrotoxicosis fifteen years back and improved after oral antithyroid drugs. General examination revealed bradycardia, obesity, hoarseness, proptosis and <b>acropachy.</b> Dermatological examination revealed pretibal as well as generalised myxoedema with cold, hyperpigmented and xerotic skin. Hair was thin, coarse and brittle and nails brittle. Face appeared puffy, expressionless and eyelids wrinkled and drooping. Palms, soles had a yellowish hue. The neck revealed a diffusely enlarged thyroid. Hormone profile revealed reduced T 3, T 4 and raised TSH. Thyroperoxidase antibody was positive. ECG showed low voltage sinus bradycardia. X-ray hands substantiated thyroid <b>acropachy.</b> Skin biopsy confirmed pretibial myxoedema. He was diagnosed as Graves disease with past hyperthyroidism and present hypothyroid state and managed with oral thyroxine with improvement. The pretibial myxoedema was successfully managed with intralesional and topical steroids...|$|E

40|$|Orbital and pretibial {{fibroblasts}} are {{targets of}} autoimmune attack in Graves’ ophthalmopathy (GO) and pretibial dermopathy (PTD). The fibroblast autoantigen {{involved in these}} peripheral manifestations of Graves’ disease {{and the reason for}} the association of GO and PTD with hyperthyroidism are unknown. RNA encoding the full-length extracellular domain of the TSH receptor has been demonstrated in orbital and dermal fibroblasts from patients with GO and normal subjects, suggesting a possible antigenic link between fibroblasts and thyrocytes. RNA was isolated from cultured orbital, pretibial, and abdominal fibroblasts obtained from patients with severe GO (n = 22) and normal subjects (n = 5). RNA was reverse transcribed, and the resulting cDNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, using primers spanning overlapping regions of the entire extracellular domain of the TSH receptor. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed an A for C substitution in the first position of codon 52 in 2 of the patients, both of whom had GO, PTD, and <b>acropachy.</b> Genomic DNA isolated from the 2 affected patients, and not from an additional 12 normal subjects, revealed the codon 52 mutation by direct sequencing and AciI restriction enzyme digestions. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the uresence of a eenomic point mutation, leading to a threonine for pro&e amino acid-shift in the predicted peptide, in the extracellular domain of the TSH receptor in two patients with severe GO, PTD, <b>acropachy,</b> and high thyroidstimulating immunoglobulin levels. RNA encoding this mutant product was demonstrated in the fibroblasts of these patients. We suggest that the TSH receptor may be an important fibroblast autoantigen in GO and PTD, and that this mutant form of the receptor may have unique immunogenic properties. ...|$|E
40|$|Pachydermoperiostosis, {{which occurs}} more {{frequently}} in men, is a rare entity with distinctive clinical features and an insidious onset [...] We report {{the case of a}} 30 -year-old man with a one-year history of <b>acropachy,</b> arthralgias, hiperhidrosis, and progressive skin thickening of the face and scalp. The radiological findings were consistent with periostosis and the histopathological analysis from a facial skin biopsy showed a pandermal increase in the thickness and number of collagen bundles. The pathogenesis of PDP is currently unknown, although an increased secretion of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), which stimulates the overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been suggested as a major factor.

40|$|Graves' disease (GD) is {{characterized}} by a hyperfunctioning thyroid gland due to stimulation of the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor by autoantibodies directed against it. Apart from thyrotoxicosis, other clinical manifestations include ophthalmopathy, dermopathy, and rarely <b>acropachy.</b> GD is an organ-specific autoimmune disorder, and hence is associated with various other autoimmune disorders. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is one such disease, which is seen with patients of GD and vice versa. Though the association of GD and myasthenia is known, subtle manifestations of latter can be frequently missed in routine clinical practice. The coexistence of GD and ocular MG poses a significant diagnostic dilemma to treating physicians. The ocular manifestations of myasthenia can be easily missed in case of GD and falsely attributed to thyroid associated ophthalmopathy due to closely mimicking presentations of both. Hence, a high degree of the clinical vigil is necessary in such cases to appreciate their presence. We present a similar case which exemplifies the above said that the clinical challenge in diagnosing coexistent GD and ocular myasthenia...|$|E
40|$|Pretibial myxedema is an {{infrequent}} dermatopathy, {{that occurs}} in some patients with Graves' disease. It rarely coexist with thyroid ophtalmopathy or <b>acropachy,</b> the other manifestations of this autoimmunological disease. We present {{a case of a}} 76 -year-old woman with Graves' disease who was first treated with thyreostatics and then, because of the recurrent thyreotoxicosis she was given a radical therapy with radioactive iodine. Two years later a nonpitting edema accompanied by typical skin color changes and hipertrichosis localized on her feet and in the pretibial area appeared. Our patient didn't realize that it could be a new manifestation of Graves' disease. Many dermatological diseases were considered in the differential diagnosis. Because of the dermatological and ophtalmological complaints both local and systemic steroids were given by the endocrinologist and a complete remission was achieved. The dose of steroids was gradually reduced. About three weeks after the therapy was finished, the symptoms' recurrence was observed. The therapy with steroids was repeated and the second remission was achieved. The patient stays under the clinical control. We present this case because of the rare incidence of the pretibial myxedema, the diagnostic problems and treatment difficulties that it caused to many specialists...|$|E
40|$|Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is an {{autoimmune}} condition, {{which is}} associated with poor clinical outcomes including impaired {{quality of life and}} socio-economic status. Current evidence suggests that the incidence of GO in Europe may be declining, however data on the prevalence of this disease are sparse. Several clinical variants of GO exist, including euthyroid GO, recently listed as a rare disease in Europe (ORPHA 466682). The objective was to estimate the prevalence of GO and its clinical variants in Europe, based on available literature, and to consider whether they may potentially qualify as rare. Recent published data on the incidence of GO and Graves' hyperthyroidism in Europe were used to estimate the prevalence of GO. The position statement was developed by a series of reviews of drafts and electronic discussions by members of the European Group on Graves' Orbitopathy. The prevalence of GO in Europe is about 10 / 10, 000 persons. The prevalence of other clinical variants is also low: hypothyroid GO 0. 02 - 1. 10 / 10, 000; GO associated with dermopathy 0. 15 / 10, 000; GO associated with <b>acropachy</b> 0. 03 / 10, 000; asymmetrical GO 1. 00 - 5. 00 / 10, 000; unilateral GO 0. 50 - 1. 50 / 10, 000...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Although {{a higher}} {{prevalence}} of psychiatric disease {{has been reported}} in patients with Graves disease, the nature of this association is unclear. Biologically plausible mechanisms have been described to link severe psychological stress with dysregulation of the immune system and loss of self-tolerance. Methods: We describe a 53 -year-old female with Graves disease who developed acute, painful finger swelling during a state of heightened psychological distress. The Graves disease had been treated definitively with radioactive iodine several years prior to the onset of these symptoms. There was a clear temporal relation between the onset of the patient's acute manic episode, which was sufficently severe to lead to admission to an inpatient psychiatric ward, and the subsequent development of finger swelling about 1 week later. Results: Hand radiographs demonstrated erosion and thickening of the periosteum in the proximal phalanges of both hands and new cortical bone formation at these sites. These changes are consistent with thyroid <b>acropachy,</b> a connective-tissue manifestation of Graves disease. The patient was also noted to have marked nail clubbing and pretibial myxedema, characterised by a violaceous eruption overlying both shins. Conclusion: The pathogenesis of soft-tissue manifestations of Graves disease are incompletely understood. This case supports the possibility that severe psychological stress may exacerbate thyroid autoimmunity and specifically, rare soft-tisse manifestations of this condition. 4 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA) is a bone {{pathology}} {{that can}} be associated with a number of focal or systemic diseases, particularly those affecting the respiratory system. HOA is characterized by proliferative periostosis of the long bones, especially in their distal and periarticular regions. This report presents a probable case of HOA in the skeleton of an elderly Portuguese male from Évora, Portugal, who died in 1970. The skeleton was evaluated by morphological, radiological, and histological methods. We found bilateral periosteal proliferation of the tubular bones, remodeling of the phalanges of the feet, and new bone formation on rib visceral surfaces. Bone alterations are more severe on the left tibia and fibula, where lesions display a ‘tree bark’ appearance, leading to severe thickening of the diaphysis. Microscopically, we observed deposition of porous woven bone. Our evaluation also considers a differential diagnosis of the lesions, which includes melorheostosis, hypervitaminosis A, fluorosis, thyroid <b>acropachy,</b> tuberculosis, and treponematosis.

40|$|Graves' orbitopathy (GO) {{is part of}} an {{autoimmune}} disease constellation comprising hyperthyroidism, orbitopathy, pretibial myxedema, and <b>acropachy.</b> Signs and symptoms of GO occur due to inflammation of the orbital connective tissue, inflammation and fibrosis of the extraocular muscles, and adipogenesis. Stimulatory TSH receptor (TSHR) antibodies (TRAb) cause hyperthyroidism, but pathogenetic mechanisms in the orbit are less clear. The TSHR is one of the favoured candidate antigens; others such as the IGF 1 R might also play a role. Compared with other anatomical locations, orbital fibroblasts are extremely reactive to inflammatory stimuli, especially via CD 40 activation. Orbital fibroblasts also differentiate into adipocytes, in response to the prevailing inflammatory cytokine milieu. Consequently TSHR gene expression increases together with expression of adipogenesis related genes. The same genes that confer susceptibility to Graves' disease (GD), both thyroid specific and immunoregulatory, also influence GO, although an increasing number of candidate genes with higher impact on orbitopathy are being identified. Smoking is the only environmental factor known to increase the likelihood and severity of GO developing in GD patients. A robust animal model of GO would facilitate the evaluation of new treatments. To date most models have centered on provoking autoimmune responses to the TSHR, but other antigens, alone or in combination with this receptor, hopefully will succeed in inducing the full spectrum of GD...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Graves’ {{hyperthyroidism}} has {{a number}} of well-recognized but relatively rare extrathyroid manifestations such as thyroid <b>acropachy,</b> pretibial myxedema, and congestive heart failure. Case presentation A 38 -year-old Caucasian woman presented to the out-patient clinic with symptoms of hyperthyroidism lasting for approximately five months. Remarkably, she had developed pitting edema of her left leg four months before. She had gone through a conventional assessment, but the reason for the edema was not revealed. At presentation to the endocrinology clinic, the skin of both legs was of normal color and pitting edema on her left leg was of a diffuse nature and spread from her toes to two thirds of her leg. The skin surface of her left leg was smooth and had no elevations or discoloration, whereas her right leg appeared normal. Based on signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone level (less than 0. 001 mIU/L, local reference of 0. 4 to 4), treatment of 10 mg of thiamazole three times a day was started. Additional blood tests revealed marked Graves’ hyperthyroidism with elevated free T 4 and anti-thyroid receptor antibodies. Within a month, the free T 4 level was normalized and the edema was completely cleared and never reappeared during the treatment course of 12 [*]months. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of unilateral treatment-responsive leg edema as a manifestation of Graves’ hyperthyroidism. However, the pathophysiological mechanism underlying this case of edema remains unclear. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is an {{autoimmune}} condition, {{which is}} associated with poor clinical outcomes including impaired {{quality of life and}} socio-economic status.

40|$|This is a {{prospective}} cross sectional descriptive study performed at Khartoum Teaching Hospital clinics {{in the period}} from January 2004 to July 2004. Aims: To diagnose patients with Graves’ disease among thyrotoxic patients by detection of TSI in their sera, to assess the frequency of Graves’ disease, and to study the clinical patterns of Graves’ disease. Patients & methods: Forty-nine patients with thyrotoxicosis (confirmed by laboratory investigations) were studied. Data was collected using designed questionnaire. TSI in the sera was detected by RIA. Frequency of Graves’ disease was determined. Symptoms and signs of the patients with TSI were studied. Results: Out of Forty-nine patients, thirty-four patients {{were found to have}} detectable significant level of TSI. Frequency of Graves’ disease amongst the patients was 69. 4 %. Main symptoms were dislike to hot weather (70 %), palpitation (35 %), tremor (24 %) infertility (20 %), irritability (35 %), fatigability (10 %). Main signs were onycholysis (73 %), proptosis (64 %), tachycardia (44 %) diffuse Goiter (30 %), palmer erythema and anemia (7 %), thyroid <b>acropachy</b> and pretibial myxodema (0 %) Conclusion: Graves’ disease is the commonest cause of hyperthyroidism in patients with thyrotoxicosis in K. T. H. Diagnosis of Graves’ disease is done by detection of TSI in the patient serum. Dislike to hot weather and palpitation are major symptoms of Graves’. Proptosis is a major sign of Graves’.

40|$|Among {{incident}} {{cases of}} GO in Olmsted County, Minnesota: GO affected females six times {{more frequently than}} males (86 % versus 14 % of cases, respectively). The age-adjusted incidence rate was 16 cases per 100, 000 population per year for females and 2. 9 cases per 100, 000 population for males. The peak incidence rates were bimodal, occurring in the age groups 40 to 44 years and 60 to 64 years in females and 45 to 49 years and 65 to 69 years in males. Among patients with GO, approximately 90 % had Graves' hyperthyroidism, 1 % had primary hypothyroidism, 3 % had Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and 5 % were euthyroid. Eyelid retraction {{was the most common}} ophthalmic feature of autoimmune thyroid disease, being present either unilaterally or bilaterally in more than 90 % of patients {{at some point in their}} clinical course. Exophthalmos of one or both eyes affected approximately 60 % of patients, restrictive extraocular myopathy was apparent in about 40 % of patients, and optic nerve dysfunction occurred in either one or both eyes in 6 % of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. Only 5 % of patients had the complete constellation of classic findings: eyelid retraction, exophthalmos, optic nerve dysfunction, extraocular muscle involvement, and hyperthyroidism. Upper eyelid retraction, either unilateral or bilateral, was documented in approximately 75 % of patients at the time of diagnosis of GO. Lid lag also was a frequent early sign, being present either unilaterally or bilaterally in 50 % of patients at the initial examination. At the time of diagnosis of GO, the most frequent ocular symptom was pain or discomfort, which affected 30 % of patients. Some degree of diplopia was noted by approximately 17 % of patients, lacrimation or photophobia was present in about 15 % to 20 % of patients, and 7. 5 % of patients complained of blurred vision. Decreased vision attributable to optic neuropathy was present in less than 2 % of eyes at the time of diagnosis of GO. Thyroid dermopathy and <b>acropachy</b> accompanied GO in approximately 4 % and 1 % of patients, respectively. Myasthenia gravis occurred in less than 1 % of patients. Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis was documented in less than 4 % of patients. The median age at the time of diagnosis of GO was 43 years (range, 8 to 88). Among patients with hyperthyroidism, 61 % developed ophthalmopathy within 1 year of the onset of thyrotoxicosis. Symptoms and signs for which statistically significant changes occurred between the initial and final examinations included lacrimation, pain or ocular discomfort, photophobia, eyelid retraction, lid lag, eyelid fullness, conjunctival injection, chemosis, and exophthalmos.
