40|$|Summary. This paper {{reviews the}} {{application}} of project appraisal techniques to analysing the cost-effectiveness of local investment subsidies (<b>advance</b> <b>factory</b> building). Coot per job measures are shown to be dependent upon the method of assessing {{the number of jobs}} created, and the assumptions used in evaluating Exchequer as well as social coots and benefits. If reafisfic probabifities are adopted about the fikeHhood of previously unemployed persons obtaining a job other than in the advance factories, then such local investment subsidies are not economically viable in Exchequer terms. Local investment subsidies may be justified on cost-benefit grounds, but even by this criterion, the number of subsidy-created relative to subsidy-diverted jobs is crucial to the decision...|$|E

The Romantic movement was also pessimistic towards the rise of technology and longed for simpler and more natural times.

W.A.R.Bown was charged with developing the new production facility consequently delaying the immediate development of the 2F machine. It took until 1950 before a 2F-powered machine came to market as the Bown Auto-roadster again exploiting the Bown marque with the epithets Hand Built and Since 1860. William Bown continued to develop motorcycles for the company releasing the Bown 1F in 1951. Some 3,000 of autocycles were produced.|$|R
50|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of items and parts that players can {{manufacture}} in StarMade. Players start manufacturing by crafting a Basic Factory from their inventory. The Basic Factory Block acts as the beginner crafting table. In order to craft items, players place the ingredients in the inventory of the factory and they select a recipe to start crafting from. Then the Factory block will produce items every tick until it runs out of ingredients. The Factory Block can be used to manufacture more advanced crafting blocks as well. Each Factory can craft things that the other tiers cannot. For example, The Standard factory can craft items that the Basic <b>Factory</b> and <b>Advanced</b> <b>Factory</b> cannot craft. Players may also buy parts and ingredients in the randomly spawned shops with the credits currency.|$|R

40|$|Irish {{industrial}} policy explicitly encouraged job generation in certain ?designated? areas via, amongst other things, preferential grant treatment, job targets {{and the building}} of <b>advance</b> <b>factories</b> in the IDA?s (Industrial Development Authority) regional industrial plans of 1973 - 1977 and 1978 - 1982. To {{assess the impact of}} these regional plans, this paper compares the employment performance of the designated and the non-designated areas in Ireland since 1972 by employing the job flow methodology pioneered by Davis and Haltiwanger (1992). We find that the convergence in aggregate industrial employment levels between designated and non-designated areas observed since 1972 has been largely driven by a higher rate of job creation without an accompanying higher rate of job destruction in the designated areas. Our econometric study attributes an annual 27 per cent of the job generation in the designated areas during the relevant period to the explicit regional {{industrial policy}}...|$|R
50|$|Piedmont's {{architecture}} varies very much. The mountainous areas remain {{similar to}} those of the Aosta Valley, the central area is a similar to that of Lombardy, the western area and Turin are very French in style, whilst the Southern part is similar to the architecture of Liguria. However, Piedmont is known for its grand country houses and palaces, such as the Palazzina di caccia di Stupinigi, in Stupinigi and just outside Turin, or the Residences of the Royal House of Savoy which ended up being declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Turin's architecture is grandiose, and mixes elements of Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassicism together. As one of the most important industrial regions in Italy, Piedmont is also renowned for its world-class modern-design architecture, such as the Lingotto, for a period one of the biggest and most technologically <b>advanced</b> <b>factories</b> in Europe, or the region's 1930s mountain hotels.|$|R

50|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} of game play relates to the player purchasing and operating a variety of locomotives, each of which possesses different attributes relating to speed, fuel type, preferred cargo, {{and the ability to}} traverse hills and steep track grades. In general, the player should balance the cost of operating a train and the time required to transport cargo, with the balance being that the profit from cargo delivery outweighs train operating costs. The player also may purchase various industrial plants to earn extra money based on amount of cargo received and delivered. Basic industry, such as bakeries, textile mills, and tool and die factories, earns less profit than <b>advanced</b> <b>factories</b> such as canneries, steel mills and automobile plants, although the latter require multiple goods delivered to produce one final product. Furthermore, idle industries which do not produce goods will generate a negative profit, thus increasing overall operating costs and overhead.|$|R

40|$|Die Suche nach geeigneten Konzepten für eine wettbewerbsfähige Fabrik gestaltet sich immer schwieriger. Einerseits erscheint Massenproduktion als Produktionsstrategie angesichts der eindrucksvollen Erfolge der schlanken Fertigung im gegenwärtigen Wettbewerbsumfeld als inadäquat. Andererseits hat die Kundenorientierung der Produktion mit Hilfe einer Fertigungssegmentierung mittlerweile viel von ihrem Potential zur wettbewerblichen Differenzierung eingebüßt.

40|$|From {{the early}} 19 th {{to the middle}} of the 20 th century, brick {{chimneys}} formed part of the industrial landscape. As technology <b>advanced,</b> <b>factories</b> were abandoned and became absorbed by the cities growing around them but masonry brick chimneys found a new role as part of the historical heritage. A large number of these structures are now protected buildings, which means they have to be maintained in a good state of conservation. Architects and engineers who have to assess the condition or retrofit these structures therefore need to be familiar with the different types of damage that can affect brickwork chimneys, and having access to a classification of the different types of damage they are prone to would be very useful to them. This paper classifies and describes the most common defects found in these structures, compiled after a close inspection of 538 Spanish industrial chimneys. The types of damage were classified according to: a) changes in the materials used in their construction, b) damage caused by repeated actions, c) damage due to extraordinary events, and d) damage caused by living organisms...|$|R

This policy of [...] "Self Containment" [...] led to Australia being able to supply itself with light weapons and ammunition by World War Two. The Munitions Supply Board (1921 to 1939) inherited the defence factories of the Commonwealth Arsenal, and its High Explosives and Filling Factory Group in Victoria became the centre of chemical engineering in Australia. Other Munitions Supply Board assets in the 1920s included the Ordnance Factory Group, Gun Ammunition Factory Group, and Small Arms Ammunition Factory in Victoria, and the Small Arms Factory Group in New South Wales.
