40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relative importance of country of manufacturing and country-of-brand versus the functional attributes for industrial products. The study examines country of origin, country-of-brand origin, and how they affect the purchasing team, or what is referred to in this study as the decision-making unit, when purchasing commercial refrigeration compressors. The literature reveals that the international marketing community has been looking at the country-of-origin and what effect it has on the purchasing decision-making process. Even though the world seems to be becoming smaller, purchasing people may still be valuing the country or brand effect before making final purchasing decisions. A conjoint analysis experiment was performed with {{a group of people who}} have purchased commercial refrigeration compressors in the past 5 years. The QuestionPro web page was used to collect the data from global users, where they were asked to rank the 36 conjoint <b>analysis</b> <b>cards</b> and a questionnaire which was to determine the respondents 2 ̆ 7 demographic characteristics...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{some preliminary}} results of several knowledge-acquisition and documentation-structuring techniques {{that were used}} to assess the working styles of architects. The focus of this assessment was on their strategic design behaviour. Hettema's Interactive Personality Model (Hettema 1979, 1989) was used to explain and interpret these results. The methods used to acquire the necessary data are protocol <b>analysis,</b> <b>card</b> sorting and interviews. The results suggest that at least three parameters can be used to explain and differentiate the strategic design behaviour of architects. These parameters are S (site-oriented), B (brief-oriented) and C (concept-oriented). A priority hierarchy of these parameters reveals six major distinguishable working styles.

40|$|Despite {{vigorous}} {{efforts and}} achievements {{in the design}} research area, the gap between design practice and design research has been impeding the application of research outcomes to design practice. This research investigated research trends in the design community by analyzing 83 research papers which {{were published in the}} recent three years (2009 ~ 2011) from four types of international journals and proceedings. A framework for analysis of design research and an <b>analysis</b> <b>card</b> were designed for this study. The framework describes how and when an outcome of design research affects the progress of design practice. Then the cards were used to summarize the researches. According to the analysis, the majority of research investigated and explored the theoretical background of design rather than providing practical tools which can be used directly in design practice. Also, most papers were the result of experiments, case studies, and literature studies which are distinct from actual design practices. These design research tendencies impede the circulation of design knowledge between the area of design research and design practice. clos...|$|R

More specifically, Chan (1990) reports, “that the ability of organizing and applying schemata determines a designer’s ability” (p. 78). The {{purpose of this study}} was to measure the impact and effectiveness of a conceptual advanced organizer, a database/analysis card model, in the interior design studio. The effectiveness characteristics were examined from four main areas of a design project: 1) organization of information, 2) categorization of information, 3) application of theory, and 4) overall design. The following research questions were addressed: 1. Do students, who use conceptual advanced organizers, develop design projects that are more organized than students who do not use such organizers? 2. Do students, who use conceptual advanced organizers, develop design projects that categorize information more effectively than students who do not use such organizers? 3. Do students, who use conceptual advanced organizers, develop design projects that are more theoretically-based than students who do not use such organizers? 4.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to build a behavior prediction model of Massively Multiplayer Online Role-playing Game (MMORPG) gameplay using the GOMS analysis method. GOMS <b>analysis</b> (<b>Card</b> et al. 1983) is an observational approach to Human Computer Interaction (HCI) to model and predict behaviors of a human operator in a highly interactive task. This method has been employed by many researchers in order to model and predict the behaviors of gamers (or computer game players). However, it is rare to find its application in the MMORPG game genre. In this research, a pilot experiment was previously conducted with three skilled gamers. The gamers were provided with the goals and operators through the user's guide book, and they found methods and selection rules while being observed (Song et al., 2006). Based on the results obtained from the pilot study, this research was expanded and the model was further tested with 30 subjects (gamers). The new outcomes revealed that the relevance of GOMS analysis for predicting selection rules is 96. 25 % according to the degree of abstraction and 77. 35 % based on the degree of complexity.

40|$|The {{flashback}} or {{propagation of}} premixed flames along the near-wall low-velocity region {{at the base}} of a laminar boundary layer of a reactive mixture has been studied numerically. The <b>analysis,</b> <b>carded</b> out using the constant density approximation for an Arrhenius overall reaction, accounts for the effects of the Lewis number of the fuel. The flow field, as seen by an observer moving with file front, includes the unknown flame front velocity U relative to the wall and the linear velocity gradient A {{at the base of}} the boundary layer. Due to this gradient, the flame front is curved with a radius of curvature lF = SL/A, proportional to the planar flame velocity SL. The front velocity is changed from SL by a factor which depends on the Karlovitz number, or non-dimensional wall velocity gradient, defined as the ratio between the thickness of the planar flame and the front curvature lF. The front velocity has been calculated in the limiting cases of adiabatic and isothermal walls. The front velocity changes from negative to positive when the Karlovitz number decreases below a critical value, determining the onset of flashback. This critical value, which decreases when the Lewis number of the fuel increases, is smaller for isothermal than for adiabatic walls. In this second case, when the flame is not quenched close to the wall, flashback is prevented by flame stretch associated with flame curvature...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{producing}} datasets for regional scale climate change research and application, the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis for the period 1948 - 2005 was dynamically downscaled to hourly, 10 km resolution over California using the Regional Spectral Model. This is Part 1 of a two part paper, describing {{the details of the}} downscaling system and comparing the downscaled <b>analysis</b> (<b>CaRD</b> 10) against observation and global analysis. An extensive validation of the downscaled analysis was performed using station observations, Higgins gridded precipitation analysis and Precipitation-elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model precipitation analysis. In general, the CaRD 10 near-surface wind and temperature fit better to regional scale station observations than the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis used to force the regional model, supporting the premise that the regional downscaling is a viable method to attain regional detail from large scale analysis. This advantage of CaRD 10 was found on all time scales, ranging from hourly to decadal scales, i. e. from diurnal variation to multi-decadal trend. Dynamically downscaled analysis provides ways to study various regional climate phenomena of different time scales because all produced variables are dynamically, physically and hydrologically consistent. However, the CaRD 10 is not free from problems. It suffers from positive bias in precipitation for heavy precipitation events. The CaRD 10 is inaccurate near the lateral boundary where regional detail is damped by the lateral boundary relaxation. It is important to understand these limitations before the downscaled analysis is used for research. 31...|$|R

40|$|Background: Currently, {{it is well}} {{established}} that cancer arises in chronically inflamed tissue. A number of NOD-like receptors (NLRs) form inflammasomes, intracellular multiprotein complexes critical for generating mature pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 1 b and IL- 18). As chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa {{is a consequence of}} Helicobacter pylori infection, we investigated the role of genetic polymorphisms and expression of genes involved in the NLR signalling pathway in H. pylori infection and related gastric cancer (GC). Materials and Methods: Fifty-one genetic polymorphisms were genotyped in 310 ethnic Chinese (87 non-cardia GC cases and 223 controls with functional dyspepsia). In addition, gene expression of 84 molecules involved in the NLR signalling pathway was assessed in THP- 1 cells challenged with two H. pylori strains, GC 026 (GC) and 26695 (gastritis). Results: CARD 8 -rs 11672725, NLRP 3 -rs 10754558, NLRP 3 -rs 4612666, NLRP 12 -rs 199475867 and NLRX 1 -rs 10790286 showed significant associations with GC. On multivariate <b>analysis,</b> <b>CARD</b> 8 -rs 11672725 remained a risk factor (OR: 4. 80, 95 % CI: 1. 39 – 16. 58).

Statistical analyses assessing the joint effect of H. pylori infection and the selected polymorphisms revealed strong associations with GC (CARD 8, NLRP 3, CASP 1 and NLRP 12 polymorphisms). In gene expression analyses, five genes encoding NLRs were significantly regulated in H. pylori-challenged cells (NLRC 4, NLRC 5, NLRP 9, NLRP 12 and NLRX 1).

Afterwards, all the twenty packages of ENE items of 2013 – 2014 academic year were codified. Additionally, to ensure the reliability of the study, three inter-raters analyzed a sample of the test packages. The results indicated that Lower Order Thinking Skills (LOTS) still prevailed in ENE items. Of all the test packages, the items categorized into literal level represented around 68. 6 % of the total number of the questions. Meanwhile, the questions belonging to reorganization came to occupy a percentage of 20. 8. In addition, few of the questions asking students' Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) were available in the ENE, specifically, the inferential level which only reached 10. 3 %.
