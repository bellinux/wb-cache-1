5|$|As {{opposed to}} {{previous}} expansion drafts, players {{from both the}} American League (AL) and National League (NL) were available to the expansion clubs. Each existing club could protect 15 players on their 40-man roster from being drafted <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> player could be drafted from each team in each round. At {{the end of each}} round, NL teams could protect an additional three players and AL teams could protect an additional four. To further protect the AL teams, a maximum of eight AL teams could have three players chosen.|$|E
5|$|Between 1873 and 1882 Steinitz {{played no}} tournaments <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> match (a 7–0 win against Blackburne in 1876). His other games {{during this period}} were in {{simultaneous}} and blindfold exhibitions, which contributed {{an important part of}} a professional chess-player's income in those days (for example in 1887 Blackburne was paid 9 guineas for two simultaneous exhibitions and a blindfold exhibition hosted by the Teesside Chess Association; this was equivalent to about £4,800 at 2007 values).|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{moved to}} Auckland in 1902, and played his club rugby for City, before joining Ponsonby the {{following}} season. He had been displaced {{from the national}} team by this time, with Cantabrian Bernard Fanning preferred at lock. The New Zealanders used a different scrum formation than seen today, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> lock was ever required.|$|E

5|$|Fluxus, a loose {{association}} of Dada-inspired avant-garde artists that {{developed in the}} early 1960s, was active in New York and Europe.

5|$|In {{advance of}} the system, {{officials}} issued storm warnings for coastal areas of Alabama and western Florida, and residents in low-lying areas were advised to seek higher ground.

5|$|In the Canadian {{portion of}} the Columbia Basin, almost half of {{which is part of}} the Kootenay River basin, there are 447 species of {{terrestrial}} vertebrates. Most of the Kootenay basin lies within the Columbia Glaciated ecoregion which encompasses much of northeastern Washington, northern Idaho, northwestern Montana and southern British Columbia. Fish fauna in the region are largely shared with those of the Columbia Unglaciated ecoregion to the south, which has about fifty species of fish <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> endemic species. There are no endemic fish within the Columbia Glaciated region itself.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of nationalisation, {{interchanges}} were provided between the lines previously belonging to the three different companies that built them (AATC, CHADOPyF and Lacroze) since previously only the CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) had formal connections between them. However, the rate of expansion of the network during this period had slowed considerably <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> station was opened during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, the Canadian Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine {{developed}} the Kidd/Stubbs serial decompression model. This differs from Haldanian models which are parallel models {{and assume that}} all compartments are exposed to ambient partial pressures and no gas interchange occurs between compartments. A serial model assumes that the diffusion takes place {{through a series of}} compartments, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> is exposed to the ambient partial pressures and is in effect a compartmentalised version of the Hempelman bulk diffusion slab model.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{soldiers}} {{of the task force}} were teenagers with no combat experience and only eight weeks of basic training.

Many of them nevertheless volunteered to join the task force. The soldiers were each equipped with only 120 rounds of ammunition and two days of C-rations.|$|E

Of his published work, almost all appeared posthumously, and most of it in the 20th century. Several unpublished manuscripts are held in museums, private collections and university archives, including the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford, the British Library in London and the Beinecke Library at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|Regenbald {{remained}} at the royal court throughout Edward's reign and into the reign of King William the Conqueror.

The names of about eighty warriors are given in the poem.|$|E
5|$|The inquiry's {{final report}} was {{released}} just 12 {{days before the}} 2014 municipal election. Ongoing anger over city council's handling of the Algo Centre Mall resulted in incumbent mayor Rick Hamilton and two incumbent city councillors who ran against him for the mayoralty being defeated by political newcomer Dan Marchisella, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> seat on city council was won by an incumbent councillor.|$|E
5|$|The {{kings of}} the first kingdom were buried outside the city; the last ten kings (ending with Irkab-Damu) were buried in Darib, while older kings were buried in a royal {{mausoleum}} located in Binas <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> royal tomb dating to the first kingdom was discovered in Ebla (Hypogeum G4). This first kingdom tomb was probably built {{during the reign of}} the last king and might be an indication of Eblaite adoption of Mesopotamian traditions to bury the kings beneath their royal palaces.|$|E
