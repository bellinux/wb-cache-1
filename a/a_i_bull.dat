40|$|The {{investigation}} of the fertility capacity of <b>A.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>bulls</b> {{is one of the}} most important factors in their genetic improvement. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the results of the GnRH test and the measured and calculated size of the testicles and sperm parameters (sperm density and velocity, percentage of live and motile spermatozoa). Data was collected during three experiments from a total of 81 Holstein-Friesian breeding bulls at the National Artificial Insemination Centre of Hungary. In Experiment <b>I.</b> <b>a</b> very close correlation (r= 0. 64, p<O. OOl; r= 0. 66, p<O. OOl; r= 0. 99, p<O. OOl; r= 0. 75, pcO. 001) was found between the size of testes (weight, volume, width, length) and the calculated volume. According to the data, we may calculate volume based on the width of testicles measured by sonography. In Experiment 2. the sizes of the testicles were compared with the results of the GnRH response test. There was a close (r= 0. 63, ~~ 0. 05) correlation between the volume of testicles and the GnRH induced serum testosterone levels. In Experiment 3. it was shown that the GnRH test gives objective results only when repeated and with bulls in service. No significant correlation was found between the serum testosterone levels (before and after GnRH stimulation) and the sperm parameters...|$|R

40|$|In France, EBVs are {{routinely}} estimated for lactation somatic cell counts, female fertility, and functional longevity. These functional traits have rather low heritabilities, leading to limited reliabilities for young sires. To include these traits {{in a total}} merit index, it is desirable to improve their genetic evaluations taking advantage of indirect information. Type traits are potential early predictors of functional traits, because they are early scored and because their heritability is moderate to high. To combine the direct information on functional traits with the indirect information on type traits, {{it is necessary to}} know the genetic correlations between all traits. But it is difficult to estimate the genetic relationship between all these traits directly from the data. This is especially true when one of the traits is functional longevity evaluated by survival analysis. Here we present an approximate estimation of these genetic correlations in the French Holstein breed based on MACE methodology applied to <b>A.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>bulls</b> evaluations. These estimates are compared to correlations between proofs and, for some traits, to REML estimates obtained from smaller data samples. According to these estimates, prediction of functional longevity could be improved by udder depth and temperament, somatic cell counts by milking speed and udder depth, and (to a smaller extend) female fertility by temperament and rump angle. 1...|$|R

40|$|The major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) {{is one of the}} most diverse regions of the mammalian genome. Diversity in MHC genes is integral to their function in the immune system, and while pathogens play a key role in shaping this diversity, the contribution of other selective forces remains unclear. The controlled breeding of cattle offers an excellent model for the identification and exploration of these forces. We characterized the MHC class I genes present in a sample of Canadian Holstein <b>A.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>bulls</b> and compared the results with those obtained in an earlier study. No evidence for a reduction in MHC diversity over 20 years was observed, but the relative frequency of some haplotypes had changed: the formerly rare A 12 (w 12 B) haplotype had become the most common, together with A 15, while A 19, which dominated the earlier sample, had significantly reduced in frequency. Only 7 % of bulls in the current study were MHC homozygous compared with the 14 % expected under HardyWeinberg. To identify the selective forces at work, a gene substitution model was used to calculate the effects of MHC on selection traits using estimated breeding values for each bull. Significant associations between MHC and production, disease and fertility traits were identified, suggesting that MHC diversity is not merely shaped by disease in this controlled breeding system. The decrease in a common haplotype, the reduced number of homozygous bulls and the associations with disease and production traits together indicate that MHC diversity in dairy cattle is maintained by heterozygote advantage...|$|R

40|$|Several {{arguments}} were given for acquiring many-sided information of the transmitting ability of <b>A.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>bulls.</b> Many traits {{can be measured}} on phenotypes, but progeny testing required in many cases. The present Finnish routine includes milk and fat yields, is still fat content and live weight of daughters. Field trials have been performed with regard to several additional traits: Protein content and yield of milk. Ca. 4 600 samples were tested for clearing up the possibility of testing bulls {{on the basis of}} one sample per daughter for protein content. There were large differences between laboratories and between herds in protein content. Heritability was 0. 25, whence a repeatability of 0. 7 should be obtained with 35 daughters and samples, while in monthly testing 170 samples are needed for the same accuracy. Beef-producing ability. In slaughterhouse data from 21 700 young animals, age accounted for 42, herds 24, areas 9, breeds 3 and birth months 1. 5 p. 100 of the variance in carcass weight. Variation was wide even after correcting for age, sex, breed and area. Heritability was o. 16 and 0. 22 for 120 - 365 days old and 366 - 569 days old animals, resp. A total of 384 bulls were progeny tested on at least 10 offspring. Milkability of 6 400 ist-calvers was evaluated by ranking them within herds in groups of three cows. Heritability was 0. 08, and 162 bulls were tested on at least 10 daughters. Character, appetite and strength of estrus were ranked in the same interview trial. Heritabilities were 13, 5 and 2 p. ioo, and 162 bulls were tested. Fertility, frequency of stillborn calves, occurrence of disease, abnormal calves and rheumatic leg symptoms have also been under study. Milkability, calmness, appetite, estrus strength and carcass weight tests were positively correlated with growth performance test of sire.

30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, this is the first report that has {{evaluated}} the appropriate age at which the pre-pubertal HF × Tharparkar bull calves are responsive to the exogenous GnRH under tropical environmental conditions. The non-significance in the LH levels among the different age groups after GnRH administration in the present study is similar to the results obtained by Mongkonpunya et al. (1975). The LH concentrations after GnRH administration in Hereford bulls as observed by Schanbacher and Echternkamp (1978) are in accord with our results. The mean peak concentration of testosterone in Group <b>I</b> <b>bull</b> calves was observed as early as 2  h, whereas in both Group II and Group III bull calves, the peak was observed at 4  h after GnRH administration (Fig.  3). The pre-treatment testosterone concentrations and their increment with age are in accord with the study conducted by Gulia et al. (2010) on HF × Tharparkar bulls and bull calves. The difference between pre-treatment and peak levels of androstenedione in Group II bull calves were significant (p <  0.05) while the difference between pre-treatment and peak testosterone levels did not differ (p >  0.05). Among the three groups, only Group <b>I</b> <b>bull</b> calves showed <b>a</b> significant (p <  0.0001) difference between the pre-treatment levels and the peak concentration of testosterone after GnRH administration, indicating the responsiveness to GnRH. Since testosterone is essential for initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis (Kerr et al. 1993), the administered GnRH seemed to have a functional role only among Group <b>I</b> <b>bull</b> calves, i.e. bull calves of 14  months of age and above. The results suggest that the weekly administration of GnRH (Ali et al. 2012) in order to augment testosterone levels and decrease AFSC might be successful only in pre-pubertal HF × Tharparkar bull calves of 14  months of age and above.|$|R
