25|$|The {{number of}} {{tourists}} visiting Crimea in the 2014 season {{was lower than}} in the previous years due to a combination of Western sanctions, ethical objections by Ukrainians, and the difficulty of getting there for Russians. The Russian government attempted to stimulate the flow of tourists by subsidizing holidays in the peninsula for children and state workers from all Russia which worked mostly for state-owned hotels. In 2015 overall 3 million tourists visited Crimea according to official data, while before annexation it was around 5.5 million on average. The shortage is attributed mostly to stopped flow of tourists from Ukraine. Hotels and restaurants are also experiencing problems with finding enough seasonal workers, who were arriving from Ukraine mostly in the preceding years. Tourists visiting state-owned hotels <b>are</b> <b>complaining</b> mostly about low standard of rooms and facilities, some of them unrepaired from Soviet times.|$|E

2500|$|Mayfield's {{first solo}} album, Curtis, was {{released}} in 1970, and hit the top 20, {{as well as being}} a critical success. It pre-dated Marvin Gaye's album, What's Going On, which it has been compared to. The commercial and critical peak of his solo career came with Super Fly, the soundtrack to the blaxploitation Super Fly film. Unlike the soundtracks to other blaxploitation films (most notably Isaac Hayes' score for Shaft), which glorified the ghetto excesses of the characters, Mayfield's lyrics consisted of hard-hitting commentary on the state of affairs in black, urban ghettos at the time, as well as direct criticisms of several characters in the film. Bob Donat wrote in Rolling Stone magazine in 1972 that while the film's message [...] "was diluted by schizoid cross-purposes" [...] because it [...] "glamorizes machismo-cocaine consciousness... the anti-drug message on [...] is far stronger and more definite than in the film." [...] Because of the tendency of these blaxploitation films to glorify the criminal life of dealers and pimps in order to target a mostly black lower class audience, Mayfield's album set this movie apart. With songs like [...] "Freddie's Dead", a song that focuses on the demise of Freddie, a junkie that was forced into [...] "pushin' dope for the man" [...] because of a debt that he owed to his dealer, and [...] "Pusherman", a song that reveals how many people in the ghetto fell victim to drug abuse, and therefore became dependent upon their dealers, Mayfield illuminated a darker side of life in the ghetto that these blaxploitation films often failed to criticize. However, although Mayfield's soundtrack criticized the glorification of dealers and pimps, he in no way denied that this glorification was occurring. When asked about the subject matter of these films he was quoted stating [...] "I don’t see why people <b>are</b> <b>complaining</b> about the subject of these films”, and “The way you clean up the films is by cleaning up the streets.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The Civil Rights Movement and Black Power {{movements}} {{inspired her}} early poetry that was collected in Black Feeling, Black Talk (1967), which sold over ten thousand copies {{in its first}} year, Black Judgement (1968), selling six thousand copies in three months, and Re: Creation (1970). All three of these early works aided in establishing Giovanni as a new voice for African Americans.(30) [...] In [...] "After Mecca”: Women Poets and the Black Arts Movement, Cheryl Clarke cites Giovanni as a woman poet who became {{a significant part of}} the Civil Rights and Black Power Movement. Giovanni is commonly praised as one of the best African-American poets emerging from the 1960s Black Power and Black Arts Movements. Her early poetry that was collected in the late 1960s and early 1970s are seen as radical as and more militant than her later work. Her poems are described as being [...] "politically, spiritually, and socially aware". Evie Shockley describes Giovanni as [...] "epitomizing the defiant, unapologetically political, unabashedly Afrocentric, BAM ethos". Her work is described as conveying [...] "urgency in expressing the need for Black awareness, unity, [...] solidarity." [...] Giovanni herself takes great pride in being a [...] "Black American, a daughter, mother, and a Professor of English". (29) [...] She has since written more than two dozen books, including volumes of poetry, illustrated children's books, and three collections of essays. Her work is said to speak to all ages and she strives to make her work easily accessible and understood by both adults and children. (29) [...] Her writing has been heavily inspired by African-American activists and artists. Issues of race, gender, sexuality, and the African-American family also have influenced her work. Her book Love Poems (1997) was written in memory of Tupac Shakur, and she has stated that she would [...] "rather be with the thugs than the people who <b>are</b> <b>complaining</b> about them." [...] Additionally, in 2007 she wrote a children’s picture book titled Rosa, which centers on the life of Civil Rights leader Rosa Parks. In addition to this book reaching number three on the New York Best Seller list, it also received the Caldecott Honors Award along with its illustrator Brian Collier, receiving the Coretta Scott King award.

60|$|Now {{the point}} is not only that this view of the Irish is false, but that it is the {{particular}} view that the Americans know to be false. While we are saying that the Irish could not organise, the Americans <b>are</b> <b>complaining,</b> often very bitterly, of the power of Irish organisation. While we say that the Irishman could not rule himself, the Americans are saying, more or less humorously, that the Irishman rules them. A highly intelligent professor said to me in Boston, 'We have solved the Irish problem here; we have an entirely independent Irish Government.' While we <b>are</b> <b>complaining,</b> in an almost passionate manner, of the impotence of mere cliques of idealists and dreamers, they <b>are</b> <b>complaining,</b> often in a very indignant manner, of the power of great gangs of bosses and bullies. There are a great many Americans who pity the Irish, very naturally and very rightly, for the historic martyrdom which their patriotism has endured. But there are a great many Americans who do not pity the Irish in the least. They would be much more likely to pity the English; only this particular way of talking tends rather to make them despise the English. Thus both the friends of Ireland and the foes of Ireland tend to be the foes of England. We make one set of enemies by our action, and another by our apology.|$|E

60|$|In prose I {{doubt whether}} it be even {{possible}} to preserve our style wholly unalloyed by the vicious phraseology which meets us everywhere, from the sermon to the newspaper, from the harangue of the legislator to the speech from the convivial chair, announcing a toast or sentiment. Our chains rattle, even while we <b>are</b> <b>complaining</b> of them. The poems of Boetius rise high in our estimation when we compare them with those of his contemporaries, as Sidonius Apollinaris, and others. They might even be referred to a purer age, but that the prose, {{in which they are}} set, as jewels in a crown of lead or iron, betrays the true age of the writer. Much however may be effected by education. I believe not only from grounds of reason, but from having in great measure assured myself of the fact by actual though limited experience, that, to a youth led from his first boyhood to investigate the meaning of every word and the reason of its choice and position, logic presents itself as an old acquaintance under new names.|$|E

6000|$|In all countries, {{and in all}} ages, {{the world}} has been full of {{complaints}} of Law and Government. And one hears the same complaints in England now. You hear complaints that the laws favour one party and one rank more than another, that they are expensive, and harsh, and unfair, and what not?--But I think, my friends, that for us, and especially on this Whit-Sunday, it will be much wiser, instead of complaining of the laws, to complain of ourselves, for needing those laws. For what is it that makes laws necessary at all, except man's sinfulness? Adam required no laws in the garden of Eden. We should require no laws if we were what we ought to be--what God has offered to make us. We may see this by looking at the laws themselves, and considering the purposes for which they were made. We shall then see, that, like Moses' Laws of old, the greater part of them have been added because of transgressions.--In plain English--to prevent men from doing things which they ought not to do, and which, if they were in a right state of mind, they would not do. How many laws are passed, simply to prevent one man, or one class, from oppressing or ill-using some other man or class? What a vast number of them are passed simply to protect property, or to protect the weak from the cruel, the ignorant from the cunning! It is plain that if there was no cruelty, no cunning, no dishonesty, these laws, at all events, would not be needed. Again, one of the great complaints against the laws and the government, is that they are so expensive, that rates and taxes are heavy burdens--and doubtless they are: but what makes them necessary except men's sin? If the poor were more justly and mercifully treated, and if they in their turn were more thrifty and provident, there would be no need of the expenses of poor rates. If there was no love of war and plunder, there would be no need of the expense of an army. If there was no crime, there would be no need of the expense of police and prisons. The thing is so simple and self- evident, that it seems almost childish to mention it. And yet, my friends, we forget it daily. We complain of the laws and their harshness, of taxes and their expensiveness, and we forget all the while that it is our own selfishness and sinfulness which brings this expense upon us, which makes it necessary for the law to interfere and protect us against others, and others against us. And while we <b>are</b> <b>complaining</b> of the government for not doing its work somewhat more cheaply, we are forgetting that if we chose, we might leave government very little work to do--that every man if he chose, might be his own law-maker and his own police--that every man if he will, may lead a life [...] "against which there is no law." ...|$|E
