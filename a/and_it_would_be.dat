5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1968 season, the MCC's public position followed the advice of Douglas-Home: it was unknown whether or not South Africa would accept D'Oliveira <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better not to press the issue. Even so, three key members of the MCC were aware of the reality of the situation. Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had not publicly declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly conveyed to London in private.|$|E

5|$|Detestation of {{existing}} policies is easily transformed into forcible {{resistance of the}} authority which puts them in execution, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> folly to disregard the causal relation between the two. Yet to assimilate agitation, legitimate as such, with direct incitement to violent resistance, is to disregard the tolerance of all methods of political agitation which in normal times is a safeguard for free government. The distinction is not scholastic subterfuge, but a hard-bought acquisition {{in the fight for}} freedom.|$|E
5|$|April 15, 2005, was the 58th {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig officially {{declared}} that every April 15 would be designated as Jackie Robinson Day <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> celebrated each year throughout Major League Baseball. Every ballpark in Major League Baseball in the United States celebrated Jackie Robinson Day, unlike in 2004 {{when it was}} only celebrated in 13 ballparks. Each ballpark showed a video tribute to Robinson, and many brought out Jackie Robinson Foundation scholars onto the field before the games. In Cincinnati, Ohio, Ken Griffey, Jr. spoke of how much every African-American baseball player owes Robinson, who was chosen by manager Branch Rickey to break the color line because of Robinson's inner courage and ability to keep his temper in check.|$|E
5|$|Brimsek {{decided to}} help the war effort next season by joining the United States Coast Guard. During his time with the Coast Guard, he played with the Coast Guard Cutters hockey team in Curtis Bay, Maryland, and later served in the South Pacific. After the war ended, Brimsek {{returned}} to the Bruins {{in time for the}} 1945–46 season. However, Brimsek was not as sharp as he was before due to having not played any professional hockey for two years. In his first season back, Brimsek guided the Bruins to the Finals, matching up with the Montreal Canadiens. The Bruins were defeated in five games with three games requiring overtime. Brimsek was applauded for his performance in the playoffs, compensating for his team's weak defence. This marked Brimsek's fourth appearance in the Finals <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> his last. At the end of the season, Brimsek was also named to the NHL Second All-Star Team, the fifth time in his career.|$|E

5|$|Due to the lord's {{presence}} in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as {{without the support of}} his more powerful tenants a lord could expect his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately below them on the social scale, but absentees could expect to find their influence weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> impractical for a lord to visit all his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, it was {{determined}} a new tower needed to be built and the new structure was completed in 1868. The new lighthouse was a keeper's quarters with an attached lantern on the roof. The structure is of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk; Morgan Point in Noank; Old Field Point Light and Plum Island in New York; and Block Island North in Rhode Island. The dwelling is made of granite and the lantern made of cast iron. The original Fresnel lens was installed in the new tower. In 1890, a fog whistle was installed <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> replaced by a siren in 1905. The siren caused much distress to nearby residents {{and had to be}} modified.|$|E
5|$|Sander Gommans {{started the}} {{composition}} of the basic melodies for Invisible Circles at the beginning of 2003 in his home studio in Reuver, working at the same time on new songs for the EP Exordium. This part of the creative process had been shared with Mark Jansen for the previous albums <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> shared with keyboard player Joost van den Broek for the following ones. Gommans wrote the songs for the new album with the precise idea of pushing the music of the band closer to progressive metal, reducing the gothic atmospheres of the previous releases to a minimum and adopting as many different musical styles as he felt necessary to the convey the message of the songs. Meanwhile, his fiancée Floor Jansen was writing the lyrics and shaping the plot for the concept album.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Fremantle Prison, a former Australian prison in Fremantle, Western Australia, extends from its {{construction}} as a prison for convicts, using convict labour, in the 1850s, through to its modern-day usage {{as a tourist}} attraction. The design for Fremantle Prison {{was based on the}} Pentonville Prison in Britain, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the longest, tallest prison cell block in the southern hemisphere. Construction began in 1851, and was completed by the end of 1859. The prison was transferred to the colonial government in 1886 for use for locally sentenced prisoners. Following a Royal Commission held in 1898−99, some changes were made to Fremantle Prison, including knocking down the inner wall between two cells, introducing a prisoner classification system, and constructing internal walls in the main block to create four separate divisions. A new cell block, New Division, was completed in 1907 and occupied in 1908.|$|E
5|$|The marine {{artist and}} Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officer Norman Wilkinson, agreed with Kerr that dazzle's aim was {{confusion}} rather than concealment, but disagreed about {{the type of}} confusion to be sown in the enemy's mind. What Wilkinson {{wanted to do was}} to make it difficult for an enemy to estimate a ship's type, size, speed, and heading, and thereby confuse enemy ship commanders into taking mistaken or poor firing positions. An observer would find it difficult to know exactly whether the stern or the bow was in view; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> correspondingly difficult to estimate whether the observed vessel was moving towards or away from the observer's position.|$|E
5|$|Their first match {{took place}} on 16 September 1905 against Devon, who had been runners-up {{in the most recent}} English county championship, and for whom played ten members of Devonport Albion, the top club in England. Because of this, Devon went into the match as favourites, however the crowd of 6,000 at the match were soon stunned by the New Zealanders as they scored 12 tries and {{eventually}} won 55–4. Billy Wallace scored 28 points, including three tries, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> another 51 years before another All Black would score more points in one match. The score caused a sensation in Britain, and some newspapers even incorrectly reported the score as Devon 55, New Zealand 4. Eventually the reports were corrected, and the New Zealanders returned to Newton Abbot to be greeted by a brass band and cheering crowd.|$|E

5|$|In February, Lynch became {{involved}} with her former rival Sasha Banks' feud with Naomi and Tamina, leading to Lynch allying with Banks to defeat Naomi and Tamina in a tag team match at Fastlane on 21 February. The following night on Raw it was announced Lynch and Banks would compete in a number one contender's match, with the winner facing Charlotte for the Divas Championship at WrestleMania 32, but the match ended in a no contest when a double pin occurred. A rematch {{took place on the}} following SmackDown, which also ended in a no contest when Charlotte attacked both Lynch and Banks. As a result, a triple threat Divas Championship match between Lynch, Banks and Charlotte was announced for WrestleMania 32. At the event on 3 April, after it was announced during transmission that the Divas Championship would be withdrawn <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> replaced with the new WWE Women's Championship, with all three women competing for it in the triple threat match, in which she was unsuccessful in capturing the new title at her WrestleMania debut.|$|E
