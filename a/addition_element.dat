40|$|Accounting for {{agricultural}} {{activities such as}} P fertilization in regional models of heavy metal accumulation provides suitable sustainable management strategies to reduce nutrient surpluses and metal inputs in agricultural soils. Using the balance model PROTERRA-S, we assessed the phosphorus (P), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) flux balances in agricultural soils of a rural region in Switzerland for different farm types and crop types. The P requirements of crops on arable farms were mainly supplied by commercial fertilizers and sewage sludge, while on animal husbandry farms P fertilizer demands were met by animal manure alone. Metal accumulation in soil was very different between the balance units. Estimated net Cd fluxes ranged between 1. 0 and 2. 3 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for arable farm types, 0. 6 and 2. 0 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for dairy and mixed farm types, and 9. 1 and 17. 8 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for animal husbandry farm types. Largest net Zn fluxes of 17. 9 - 39. 8 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1) were estimated for animal husbandry farms, whereas for arable farm types net Zn fluxes of 101 - 260 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) and for dairy and mixed farm types of 349 - 3360 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) were found. The results indicate that P management is a primary factor determining the variation of these net Cd and net Zn fluxes. The latter were highly sensitive to the Zn/P concentration ratio in animal manure, atmospheric deposition and crop concentrations. Variation of net Cd fluxes resulted mainly from uncertainty in crop concentrations, atmospheric deposition, leaching parameters and uncertainty in Cd/P concentration ratio of commercial fertilizers.

40|$|The {{development}} of precise {{data for the}} effect of chemistry and processing variables on the fracture toughness of low to medium carbon cast steels, is paramount to an increased understanding of the fracture behaviour of these important engineering materials. This knowledge would, in itself, lead to improvements in alloy development/selection rationale and increased cast steel usage, particularly in critical areas. Toward this end, {{an investigation into the}} influence of Cr, Mn and Ni additions on the room temperature fracture toughness and flow properties of 0. 30, 0. 40 and 0. 55 wt% C cast alloys was conducted. In order to avoid the chemical and processing complexity normally associated with commercial castings, the study was undertaken on heavy section castings produced in the laboratory from melts composed of commercial purity ingredients. Measurements were conducted on three-point bend test pieces machined from heat-treated castings. The fracture toughness techniques used included LEFM (K(,IC)), J integral and COD ((delta) (,c)). A potential drop method was employed to record crack initiation. Very high room temperature fracture toughnesses were achieved in the majority of the alloys examined, with only three alloys having K(,IC) values of less than 150 MN. m('- 3 / 2) or COD, (delta) (,c), values of less than 0. 1 mm. Further, yield stress ((sigma) (,ys)) values were found to lie within 80 - 105 % of those recorded for commercial castings of comparative composition. At the 0. 30 and 0. 40 wt% C levels {{it was found that the}} room temperature fracture toughness of the alloys was relatively independent of the microstructure as well as the amount and particular <b>addition</b> <b>element</b> employed, although variations in the tensile properties were noted. At the 0. 55 wt% C level significant differences in the fracture behaviour were caused by the individual element additions. Manganese was found to improve the toughness of the high carbon alloys, while nickel produced little change and chromium had a negative effect on toughness. In each case the influence of these elements was manifested in microstructural differences. The results of this study are reviewed in the light of the limited data available from commercial cast steels and the need for improved toughness performance without undue loss of yield strength and other properties....

40|$|Fe/Gd multilayers with {{monolayer}} and submonolayer thicknesses {{have been}} systematically studied on flat substrates and on self-assembled nanospheres with high spatial resolution. A series of Fe/Gd multilayers consisting of 75 bilayers {{have been prepared}} on flat silicon substrate with sublayer thicknesses from 0. 36 to 0. 60 nm. A thickness dependent spin reorientation transition (SRT) from an in-plane to a perpendicularly magnetized state is observed by decreasing the sublayer thickness. These results are quantitatively explained by {{the contribution of the}} stray field and by the dipolar pair ordering model. From transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis it has been seen that inhomogeneous interfaces cause an in-plane magnetization, whereas almost homogeneous interfaces lead to a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). The layer thickness (total thickness), preparation techniques, and the choice of the substrate also have a strong influence on magnetic properties of the system. The domain configuration during a temperature driven SRT is studied by photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM). A sample with the composition 75 ×[Fe (0. 36 nm) /Gd (0. 36 nm) ] initially shows an in-plane magnetization at room temperature and upon heating the sample, the in-plane domains change to a maze like, perpendicular domains. Between these transformations, a coexistence of in-plane and out-of-plane domain configurations is seen in a broad temperature range of 57 ° - 81 ° C. Micromagnetic simulations reproduced a similar coexistence phase. The presence of two local minima in the total energy, due to the different temperature behaviors of the surface anisotropy (KS) and the volume anisotropy (KV) is believed to cause this coexistence phase. After several SRT cycles the perpendicular state of the sample became more prominent at room temperature. TEM images recorded before and after annealing show significant changes in the layered structure. This infers that the chemical and structural changes in the sample upon annealing are responsible for the appearance of PMA. Upon depositing Fe/Gd multilayers on self-assembled silica or polystyrene nanospheres a new class of magnetic nanostructures with a crescent shaped cross section is produced. The influence of the thickness gradient and the curved nature of the substrate on the properties of the magnetic multilayers are studied with respect to the diameter of the spheres and the thickness of the films. A 36 nm Fe/Gd film with a composition of 50 ×[Fe (0. 36 nm) /Gd (0. 36 nm) ] has been deposited on nanospheres with diameters of 800, 330, and 160 nm. Upon increasing the diameter of the spheres to 800 nm a dramatic change in the spin structure and the reversal mechanism is observed. Local hysteresis loops of the spherules, deduced from scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (STXM) images reveal an S-shaped loop for 800 nm spherules, while for the 330 and 160 nm spherules a squared loop with a sharp switching field accompanied by a change in the magnetic anisotropy from radial to uniaxial is observed. The exchange energy that favors the parallel alignment of the spins overcomes the radial anisotropy and leads to such parallel orientation of the moments upon decreasing the diameter of the sphere. The hysteresis loops and the reversal mechanism obtained by simulation are in good agreement with the experimental results. In <b>addition,</b> <b>element</b> selective hysteresis loops on 330 and 160 nm spherules show an asymmetric behavior at Fe and Gd edges. At the maximum field of about 400 Oe Gd moments align with the field direction, whereas Fe moments tilt away from the field direction. These changes suggest a twisted magnetic state due to the increase in the curvature and the magnetic field. Furthermore, the thickness dependence of the magnetic properties is addressed. Spherules with a 36 nm thick Fe/Gd film, i. e. 50 bilayers, show an S-shaped loop. Spherules of same diameter of 800 nm but with 75 bilayers system show a squared loop with prominent steps and a strong increase in the coercive field by a factor of four. Magnetization reversal takes place through an intermediate flower state that shows up as a step in the hysteresis loop. This thickness dependent reversal mechanism is explained by the interplay between the different anisotropy terms and the thickness dependent switching field. Similar changes are not observed for the films deposited on a flat substrate. A shape induced SRT is observed for an in-plane magnetized Fe/Gd film deposited on nanospheres. A hard axis loop is observed on a flat substrate, whereas the film on spherules with a diameter of 800 nm showed a rectangular easy axis loop. This is explained by the change in the shape anisotropy. In addition to Fe/Gd system, Co/Pt multilayer system is also studied with high spatial resolution. The thickness gradient on the spheres is used to induce a thickness dependent SRT locally on every nanospheres. STXM images measured in an in-plane and an out-of-plane geometry reveal two different magnetic states at the rim and {{at the center of the}} spherules. Local hysteresis loops deduced on a &# 8776; 50 nm scale show a transformation of the magnetization curve from an easy axis loop to a hard axis loop with increasing the elevation angle on the spheres. The SRT from perpendicular to in-plane magnetization has been seen in the interval 56 ° < &# 952; < 70 ° within a distance of less than 90 nm. These results are in good agreement with micromagnetic simulations. Fe/Gd Multilagen mit Dicken im monoatomaren bis sub-monoatomaren Bereich wurden systematisch auf flachen und selbstorganisierten Nanokugeln hochauflosend untersucht. In einer Serie von Fe/Gd Multilagen bestehend aus 75 Doppelschichten wurde die Teilschichtdicke zwischen 0. 36 und 0. 60 nm variiert. Ein dickenabhängiger Spinreorientierungs übergang (SRT) von einer in der Ebene liegenden Magnetisierung zu senkrechter Magnetisierung wurde bei einer Verkleinerung der Schichtdicke beobachtet. Diese Ergebnisse können quantitativ durch den Anteil des Streufeldes und durch das dipolare Paarordnungsmodell erklärt werden. In den transmissionselektronen mikroskopie (TEM) Analysen konnte beobachtet werden, dass eine inhomogene Grenzfläche eine in der Ebene liegende Magnetisierung verursacht, wohingegen eine fast homogene Grenzschicht zu einer senkrechten magnetischen Anisotropie (PMA) führt. Die Gesamtschichtdicke, Präparationstechnik und die Wahl des Substrats haben einen starken und justierbaren Einfluss auf die magnetischen Eigenschaften. Im Falle einer Probe mit einem Aufbau von 75 ×[Fe (0. 36 nm) /Gd (0. 36 nm) ] wurde die Domänenkonfiguration während eines temperaturgetriebenen SRT im Detail mit photoemissionelektronmikroskopie (PEEM) untersucht. Die Probe zeigte anfangs eine in-plane Magnetisierung bei Raumtemperatur. Während des Erhitzens der Probe veränderten sich die in-plane Domänen zu labyrinthähnlichen, senkrecht magnetisierten Streifendomänen. In einem breiten Temperaturbereich von 57 ° - 81 ° C konnte eine Koexistenz der in-plane und senkrechten Domänenkonfiguration beobachtet werden. Mikromagnetische Simulationen reproduzieren dieses Ergebnis koexistierender Phasen. Eine Erklärung für diese Koexistenz beider Phasen könnte das Vorhandensein zweier lokaler Minima der totalen Energie aufgrund des unterschiedlichen Temperaturverhaltens der Oberflächenanisotropie (KS) und der Volumenanisotropie (KV) sein. Nach mehreren SRT-Zyklen dominierte bei Raumtemperatur der senkrechte Magnetisierungszustand. Aufgenommene TEM-Bilder vor und nach dem Anlassen zeigen eine deutliche Veränderung in der Schichtstruktur. Daraus folgt, dass die chemischen und strukturellen Änderungen in der Probe durch das Anlassen verantwortlich für den PMA-Effekt sind. Durch Auftragen der Fe/Gd Multilagen auf selbstorganisierte Silica oder Polystyrolnanokugeln konnte eine neue Klasse von magnetischen Nanostrukturen mit einem sichelförmigen Querschnitt hergestellt werden. Ein 36 nm dicker Fe/Gd Film mit einer Schichtstruktur von 50 ×[Fe (0. 36 nm) /Gd (0. 36 nm) ] wurde auf Nanokugeln mit einem Durchmesser von 800, 330 und 160 nm aufgetragen. Bei einer Erhöhung des Kugeldurchmessers auf 800 nm wurde eine dramatische Änderung der Spinstruktur und des Ummagnetisierungsmechanismus beobachtet. Während die Hysteresekurven, die mittels STXM (scanning transmission x-ray microscopy) Messungen gewonnen wurden, im Falle der 800 nm Kugeln eine S-Form zeigen, ergeben sich für die Kugeln mit einem Durchmesser von 330 bzw. 160 nm rechteckige Hysteresekurven, was mit einer Änderung der Anisotropie von radial zu uniaxial einhergeht. Die Austauschenergie, welche minimal wird für eine parallele Ausrichtung der Spins, dominiert über die radiale Anisotropie und führt zu der parallelen Ausrichtung der Momente bei einer Reduktion der Kugeldurchmessers. Die mit Hilfe der Simulation gewonnenen Ergebnisse bezüglich der Hysteresekurve und des Ummagnetisierungsmechanismus zeigen eine gute Übereinstimmung mit dem Experiment. Darüber hinaus zeigen elementselektive Hystereskurven der 330 und 160 nm Kugeln ein asymmetrisches Verhalten an den Fe und Gd Kanten. Bei dem maximalen Feld von 400 Oe richten sich die Gd Momente in Feldrichtung aus, wohingegen die Fe Momente gegen die Feldrichtung verkippt sind. Ursache hierfür ist der verkippte (“twisted”) Magnetisierungzustand, der durch die Zunahme der Krümmung und bei hohem magnetischen Feld zustande kommt. Auch hier wurde die Dickenabhängigkeit der magnetischen Eigenschaften untersucht. Kugeln, die mit einem 36 nm dicken Fe/Gd-Film (z. B. 50 Doppellagen) bedeckt sind, zeigten eine S-förmige Hysteresekurve. Kugeln mit demselben Durchmesser von 800 nm aber 75 Doppellagen zeigten dagegen eine rechteckige Hysteresekurve mit einem um einen Faktor vier größeren Koerzitivfeld. Das Schalten findet statt über einen Zwischenzustand (Flower-Zustand), welcher zu einer deutlichen Stufe in der Hysterese führt. Erklärt werden kann dies durch das Wechselspiel zwischen den verschiedenen Anisotropietermen und dem dickenabhängigen Schaltfeld. In den Filmen auf flachen Substraten konnten derartige Änderungen nicht beobachtet werden. Eine forminduzierte SRT wurde für einen in-plane magnetisierten Fe/Gd Film auf Nanokugeln beobachtet. Während die Hysteresekurve beim flachen Substrat der magnetischen schweren Richtung zugeordnet werden kann, wurde für die Kugeln mit einem Durchmesser von 800 nm eine Hystereseschleife der magnetisch leichten Richtung beobachtet. Die Ergebnisse konnten mit Hilfe der Änderung der Formanisotropie erklärt werden. Zusätzlich zu den Fe/Gd Proben wurden Co/Pt Multilagen mit hoher räumlicher Auflösung untersucht. Der Dickengradient der Schicht auf der Kugel wurde dazu benutzt, lokal eine dickenabhängige SRT zu induzieren. Die STXM Aufnahmen in-plane- und out-of-plane-Geometrie zeigen zwei unterschiedliche magnetische Grundzustände am Rand und in der Kugelmitte. Mit zunehmendem Steigungswinkeländern sich die Eigenschaften der Hysteresen kontinuierlich von einem Verhalten, welches der magnetisch schweren Richtung zugeordnet werden kann, zu einem der leichten Richtung entsprechenden Verhalten. Der Spinreorientierungs übergang von der senkrechten zur in-plane Magnetisierung wurde im Intervall von 56 ° < &# 952; < 70 ° mit einem Abstand von weniger als 90 nm beobachtet...|$|E

The optimization of structure parameters morphology is necessary because the mechanical properties depend {{on changes in}} morphology of eutectic Si and intermetallic phases in Al-Si cast alloy. This article describes changes of eutectic Si morphology after heat treatment T 4 and T 6. The morphology changes were observed using combination different analytical techniques- light microscopy (upon black-white etching) and scanning electron microscopy- SEM (upon deep etching). For the experiment was used recycled (secondary) aluminium cast alloy AlSi 9 Cu 3...|$|R
