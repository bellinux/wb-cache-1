[...] Recent seismic imaging from Geological Survey of Canada employees supported lithoprobe studies {{in the region of}} Mount Cayley in which scientists found a large reflector interpreted to be a pool of molten rock roughly [...] below the surface. The existence of hot springs at Mount Meager and Mount Cayley indicates that magmatic heat is still present beneath or near these volcanoes. This long history of volcanic activity along a still active plate boundary indicates that volcanic eruptions in the Garibaldi Belt have not ended and risks for future eruptions remain.|$|E

The method used is analytical, based on the Rodman-Wood-Roberts model and the Pohlhausen boundary layer method.

50|$|If {{one were}} to attempt to square 738 and {{calculated}} 54,464, <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> sanity <b>check</b> could show that this result cannot be true. Consider that 700 < 738, yet 700² = 7²×100² = 490,000 > 54,464. Since squaring positive integers preserves their inequality, the result cannot be true, and so the calculated result is incorrect. The correct answer, 738² = 544,644, is more than 10 times higher than 54,464, and so the result had been off by {{an order of magnitude}} (it actually misses one digit).|$|R
