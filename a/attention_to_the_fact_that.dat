5|$|The genus {{is named}} after Mr. John Kimber, student, teacher, and {{collector}} who lost his life during an expedition to Central Australia in 1964. Originally it was described with the name Kimberia. Dr. N. H. Ludbrook drew <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the name Kimberia is preoccupied by Kimberia Cotton and Woods, a turtle subgenus. Accordingly, the new name Kimberella was proposed by Mary Wade in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Not My Life calls <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> in the United States, the {{sentencing}} for human trafficking is less severe than for drug trafficking. The film indicates {{a relationship between}} contemporary slavery and globalization. It asserts that most human trafficking victims are children, although the filmmakers have recognized the fact that millions of adults are also trafficked. The film depicts human trafficking {{as a matter of}} good and evil, provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking, and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking. Bilheimer was sparing in his use of statistics in the film, feeling that overloading viewers with figures might numb them to the issues.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} into Pattle's claims {{has shown that}} at least 27 claimed victories can be directly linked to specific Italian and German losses, while only six claims are discounted as no Axis losses are recorded. Other research dedicated {{to the history of}} German bomber units, some of which took part in the air battles against Pattle's unit, have drawn <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> 97–98 percent of all German primary records belonging to the Luftwaffe have been lost either through Allied bombing or through Hermann Göring's order to destroy all records {{in the first week of}} May 1945. This makes any {{research into}} German losses difficult.|$|E

5|$|A {{plea for}} a review by the Constitutional Tribunal was sought as a last-ditch attempt {{to stave off the}} {{execution}} of drug trafficker Shanmugam Murugesu. Shanmugam's lawyer contended that his client's right to equal protection under Article 12 of the Constitution had been infringed. Referring to cases of six recent offenders similarly convicted under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Shanmugam's lawyer drew <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> those offenders had imported more than 700grammes of cannabis, an offence which attracted the death penalty, but were eventually charged with possessing less than 500grammes of cannabis which resulted only in a jail sentence. In contrast, Shanmugam, who had imported 1,029.8grammes of cannabis, did not have the amount reduced and was sentenced to death. The plea was rejected by the President on 12 May 2005, one day before the execution date.|$|E
5|$|Jane's legal husband, who {{was still}} living in London, {{attempted}} to blackmail her in 1838 by publishing {{the details of her}} marital status in Barnard Gregory's The Satirist. Johnson published the notice after learning that she was living with a Mr. Hogg. He was mistaken as to the identity of her lover, however, and attempted to blackmail James Hogg, a Member of Parliament for Beverly. After James Hogg prepared to bring a libel suit, Johnson quickly disappeared. Although one journalist initially planned to publish the correct identities of the parties involved, at Mary Shelley's request Leigh Hunt convinced him not to publish the story. Johnson died in Hammersmith in 1840, ensuring an end to the matter. Though they were now free to marry, Jane and Thomas declined to marry in order not to draw <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they had been unmarried for so long.|$|E
5|$|Denise Wong, the Calgarian {{actor who}} portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, {{said that the}} play was about the human condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama calls <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that the play will put a face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play and said that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.|$|E

While war was apparently imminent, a Spanish ironclad was coincidentally berthed in New York Harbor, drawing <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. Navy had not a single ironclad in serviceable condition for the defence of America's ports.|$|E

Tadić drew <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the KSF were formed {{on the basis of the}} Ahtisaari Plan that was never adopted by the Security Council and added that the creation of these forces constitutes a breach of the Serbian Constitution and international law, which is why they should be disbanded.

25|$|Nottinghamshire's {{claim to}} Robin Hood's {{heritage}} is disputed, with Yorkists staking {{a claim to}} the outlaw. In demonstrating Yorkshire's Robin Hood heritage, the historian J. C. Holt drew <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> although Sherwood Forest is mentioned in Robin Hood and the Monk, there is little information about the topography of the region, and thus suggested that Robin Hood was drawn to Nottinghamshire through his interactions with the city's sheriff. And, the linguist Lister Matheson has observed that {{the language of the}} Gest of Robyn Hode is written in a definite northern dialect, probably that of Yorkshire. In consequence, it seems probable that the Robin Hood legend actually originates from the county of Yorkshire. Robin Hood's Yorkshire origins are universally accepted by professional historians.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the single}} passage in which Ganesha appears in that epic. The story is not {{accepted}} {{as part of the}} original text by the editors of the critical edition of the Mahabharata, where the twenty-line story is relegated to a footnote to an appendix. Ganesha's association with mental agility and learning is probably one reason he is shown as scribe for Vyasa's dictation of the Mahabharata in this interpolation to the text. Brown dates the story as 8th century CE, and Moriz Winternitz concludes that it was known as early as c. 900 CE but he maintains that it had not yet been added to the Mahabharata some 150 years later. Winternitz also drew <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a distinctive feature of Southern manuscripts of the Mahabharata is their omission of this Ganesha legend.|$|E
25|$|Three {{statements}} {{referred to}} the case of Vignes Mourthi, who had been convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to death. Shadrake had drawn <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> one Sergeant Rajkumar from the Central Narcotics Bureau was under investigation for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act at around the time he was giving evidence in Mourthi's case. Shadrake then stated that the high echelons of the judiciary knew about Rajkumar's misdeeds but deliberately suppressed knowledge of them until after Mourthi had been executed. There was no rational basis for these statements. Shadrake claimed that the judiciary would have known of the proceedings against Rajkumar because members of the subordinate judiciary, who deal with 95% of the cases in Singapore, and prosecutors, are both drawn from the Singapore Legal Service. Furthermore, some judges of the Supreme Court were elevated from the Subordinate Courts and had served stints in the Attorney-General's Chambers. The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court's findings that this was too incredible and attenuated to form a rational basis for the claim.|$|E
