25|$|The game {{remained}} out {{of print}} <b>abandonware</b> for years due to the closure of both developer and publisher. In 2013, the rights were recovered by Night Dive Studios. Therefore, {{it was possible to}} re-release the game again as digital download on GOG.com in September 2013, and Steam in October 2013.|$|E
25|$|Nintendo of America {{took the}} same stance against the {{distribution}} of SNES ROM image files {{and the use of}} emulators as it did with the NES, insisting that they represented flagrant software piracy. Proponents of SNES emulation cite discontinued production of the SNES constituting <b>abandonware</b> status, the right of the owner of the respective game to make a personal backup via devices such as the Retrode, space shifting for private use, the desire to develop homebrew games for the system, the frailty of SNES ROM cartridges and consoles, and the lack of certain foreign imports.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Krisalis Software (developed by Simeon Pashley and Rob Hill) {{released}} the computer game, Hill Street Blues, {{based on the}} TV show. The game runs on the Amiga, Atari ST, and DOS platforms and places the player in charge of Hill Street Station and its surrounding neighborhood, {{with the aim of}} promptly dispatching officers to reported crimes, apprehending criminals, and making them testify at court. If certain areas have less serious crimes unresolved, such as bag-snatching, they soon escalate to more serious ones, such as murder in broad daylight. The game, which now falls into the category <b>abandonware,</b> is still available for download at computer game sites and outlets, and has received mixed reviews.|$|E
2500|$|DRM-related {{restrictions}} on capabilities of hardware can artificially reduce {{the range of}} potential uses of the device (to the point of making a device consisting of general-purpose components usable only for a purpose approved, or with “content” provided, by the vendor), limit upgradeability and repairability.

2500|$|The {{original}} Fido BBS software, {{and some}} other FidoNet-supporting software from the 1980s, is no longer functional on modern systems. [...] This is for several reasons, including problems related to the Y2K bug. [...] In some cases, the original authors have left the BBS or shareware community, and the software, much of which was closed source, has been rendered <b>abandonware.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Warez, and its leetspeak form W4r3z, are plural {{representations}} of the word [...] "ware" [...] (short for computer software), and are terms {{used to refer to}} [...] "irated software distributed over the Internet," [...] that is, [...] "oftware that has been illegally copied and made available" [...] e.g., after having [...] "protection codes de-activated". [...] "Cracking, or circumventing copy protection, {{is an essential part of}} the warez process," [...] and via this commonality, the definition focused on computer software has been extended to include other forms of material under copyright protection, especially movies. As Aaron Schwabach notes, the term covers both supported and unsupported materials (the latter unsupported, termed <b>abandonware),</b> and legal recourses aimed at stemming the creation and distribution of warez are designed to cover both profit-driven and [...] "enthusiast" [...] practitioners. Hence, the term refers to copyrighted works that are distributed without fees or royalties and so traded in general violation of copyright law.|$|E
2500|$|Warez is {{a common}} {{computing}} and broader cultural term referring to pirated software (i.e. illegally copied, often after deactivation of anti-piracy measures) that is distributed via the Internet. Warez is used most commonly as a noun, a plural form of ware (short for computer software), and {{is intended to be}} pronounced like the word , [...] The circumvention of copy protection (cracking) is an essential step in generating warez, and based on this common mechanism, the software-focused definition has been extended to include other copyright-protected materials, including movies and games. The global array of warez groups has been referred to as [...] "The Scene," [...] deriving from its earlier description as [...] "the warez scene." [...] Distribution and trade of copyrighted works without payment of fees or royalties generally violates national and international copyright laws and agreements. The term warez covers supported as well as unsupported (<b>abandonware)</b> items, and legal prohibitions governing creation and distribution of warez cover both profit-driven and [...] "enthusiast" [...] generators and distributors of such items.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{websites}} archive <b>abandonware</b> for download, including old {{versions of}} applications which {{are difficult to}} find by any other means. Much of this software fits the definition of [...] "software {{that is no longer}} current, but is still of interest", but the line separating the use and distribution of <b>abandonware</b> from copyright infringement is blurry, and the term <b>abandonware</b> could be used to distribute software without proper notification of the owner.|$|E

5000|$|As {{response}} to the missing availability of <b>abandonware,</b> people have distributed old software since shortly after the beginning of personal computing, but the activity remained low-key until {{the advent of the}} Internet. While trading old games has taken many names and forms, the term [...] "abandonware" [...] was coined by Peter Ringering in late 1996. Ringering found classic game websites similar to his own, contacted their webmasters, and formed the original <b>Abandonware</b> Ring in February 1997. This original webring {{was little more than a}} collection of sites linking to adventureclassicgaming.com. Another was a site indexing them all to provide a rudimentary search facility. In October 1997, the Interactive Digital Software Association sent cease and desist letters to all sites within the <b>Abandonware</b> Ring, which led to most shutting down. An unintended consequence (called the Streisand effect in Internet parlance) was that it spurred others to create new <b>abandonware</b> sites and organizations that came to outnumber the original Ring members. Sites formed after the demise of the original <b>Abandonware</b> Ring include Abandonia, Bunny <b>Abandonware</b> and Home of the Underdogs. In later years <b>abandonware</b> websites actively acquired and received permissions from developers and copyright holders (e.g. Jeff Minter, Magnetic Fields or Gremlin Interactive) for legal redistribution of abandoned works, an example is World of Spectrum who acquired the permission from many developers and successfully retracted a DMCA case.|$|E

50|$|<b>Abandonware</b> advocates also {{frequently}} cite historical preservation {{as a reason}} for trading abandoned software. Older computer media are fragile and prone to rapid deterioration, necessitating transfer of these materials to more modern, stable media and generation of many copies to ensure the software will not simply disappear. Users of still-functional older computer systems argue for the need of <b>abandonware</b> because re-release of software by copyright holders will most likely target modern systems or incompatible media instead, preventing legal purchase of compatible software.|$|E

50|$|Proponents of <b>abandonware</b> {{preservation}} {{argue that}} it is more ethical to make copies of such software than new software that still sells. Those ignorant of copyright law have incorrectly taken this to mean that <b>abandonware</b> is legal to distribute, although no software written since 1964 is old enough for copyright to have expired in the US. Even in cases where the original company no longer exists, the rights usually belong to someone else, though no one may be able to trace actual ownership, including the owners themselves.|$|E

50|$|In most cases, {{software}} classed as <b>abandonware</b> {{is not in}} {{the public}} domain, as it has never had its original copyright officially revoked and some company or individual may still own rights. While sharing of such software is usually considered copyright infringement, in practice copyright holders rarely enforce their <b>abandonware</b> copyrights {{for a number of reasons}} - chiefly among which the software is technologically obsolete and therefore has no commercial value, therefore rendering copyright enforcement a pointless enterprise. By default, this may allow the product to de facto lapse into the public domain to such an extent that enforcement becomes impractical.|$|E
