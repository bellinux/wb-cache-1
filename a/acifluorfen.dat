However, there was a wide range in the amount of Proto IX accumulation caused by 0. 1 millimolar <b>acifluorfen</b> between species. Within species, there was a reduced effect of the herbicide in older tissues. Therefore, direct quantitative comparisons between species are difficult. Nevertheless, when data from different species and from tissues of different age within a species were plotted, there was a curvilinear relationship between the amount of Proto IX caused to accumulate during 20 hours of darkness and the amount of electrolyte leakage or chlorophyll photobleaching caused after 6 and 24 hours of light, respectively, following the dark period. Herbicidal damage plateaued at about 10 nanomoles of Proto IX per gram of fresh weight. Little difference was found between in vitro <b>acifluorfen</b> inhibition of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (Protox) of plastid preparations of mustard, cucumber, and morning glory, three species with large differences in their susceptibility at the tissue level.

Os tratamentos com as respectivas doses, em kg/ha do i. a., foram os seguintes: misturas de tanque de alloxydim - Na a 1, 125, e de sethoxydim a 0, 221, com bentazon a 0, 72; combinação de diclofop-metil a 0, 84, com <b>acifluorfen,</b> a 0, 224; diclofop-metil a 0, 84, sethoxydim a 0, 147, 0, 184 e 0, 221, fluazifop-butil a 0, 25 e 0, 37, CGA 82725 (éster 2 - propilínico do ácido 2 - 4 (3, 5 - dicloro - 2 - pyridiloxi) - fenoxy - propiônico), a 0, 35; todos combinados com bentazon, a 0, 72. Utilizou-se ainda os tratamentos oryzalin + {{metribuzin}} (1, 125 + 0, 42), além das testemunhas com capina e sem capina o ciclo todo. Nas combinações, os graminicidas foram aplicados 3 dias depois de <b>acifluorfen</b> ou de bentazon. O controle de papuã (Brachiaria plantaginea (Link) Hitch) e de capim-arroz (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.) foi deficiente apenas nos tratamentos com alloxydim - Na. Milhã (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.) não foi controlada pelos tratamentos com diclofop-metil, alloxydim - Na e com as menores doses de sethoxydim. Entre as dicotiledôneas, somente guanxuma (Sida rhombifolia L.) não foi bem controlada por <b>acifluorfen.</b> A mistura de alloxydim - Na + bentazon diminuiu o efeito do graminicida, enquanto que sethoxydim + bentazon não demonstrou este antagonismo. A fitotoxicidade à soja foi mais acentuada no tratamento de diclofop-metil com <b>acifluorfen.</b> A altura e a população de plantas da soja não foram influenciadas pelos herbicidas. Fluazifop - butil na maior dose, com bentazon, apresentou o melhor rendimento (2. 416 kg/ha), superando em 5, 4 % a testemunha capinada (2. 292 kg/ha). Foram ainda superiores a esta, os tratamentos oryzalin + metribuzin, as duas maio- res doses de sethoxydim e a sua mistura de tanque com bentazon, bem como fluazifop-butil na menor dose. The {{experiment was}} carried out on a Dark Red Latosol, with 53 % clay and 4, 5 % organic matter, to study the ef ficiency and selectivity of post emergence her bicides on soybean cv União. The her bicides were applied when the weeds had 3 to 5 leaves. The following treatments (kg a. i. /ha) wer e used: tank mixes of alloxydim - Na, at 1, 125, and of sethoxydim, at 0, 221, with benta zon, at 0, 72; combination of diclofop, at 0, 84, with <b>acifluorfen,</b> at 0, 224; diclo-fop, sethoxydim, 0, 147, 0, 184 and 0, 221, fluaz ifop - but yl, 0, 25 and 0, 37, CGA 82725, 0, 35, all in combi nat ion with benta zon at 0, 72. As che ck treatments, oryza lin + met ribuzin (1, 125 + 0, 42), hoeing and no hoeing wer e used. The grass weeds her bicides, for the combinat ions, wer e applied 3 days after aciflu orfen or bentazon. The control of Brachiaria plantaginea Link. Hitch. and of Ehcinochloa crusgalli L. Beauv. was defficient only for the treatments with alloxydim - Na. Digitaria sanguinalis L. Scop. was not controled by the treatments with diclo - fop, alloxydim - Na and with the lower dosage of sethoxydim. Among the dicotiledoneous, only Sida rhombifolia L. was not controlled by <b>acifluorfen.</b> The tank mix of alloxydim - Na + bentazon decreased {{the effect of the}} grass herbicide, while sethoxydim + bentazon did not show this antagonism. Phytotoxicity was greater in the treament diclofop with <b>acifluorfen.</b> Soybean plant height and plant population, seemed not to be influen - cend by the herbicides. The highest yield (2. 416 kg/ha), which was 5, 4 % higher than the hand hoed treatment (2. 292 kg/ha), was obtained with fluazifop - butyl in its higher dosage, plus bentazon. The treatments oryzalin + metribuzin, with the two higher dosages of sethoxydim and its mixture, and the lower dosage of fluazifop - butyl were also superior to hand hoeing...|$|E
40|$|Protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase, a monotopic {{membrane}} protein, which catalyzes the oxidation of protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX in the heme/chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway, {{is distributed}} widely throughout nature. Here we present {{the structure of}} protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase from Myxococcus xanthus, an enzyme with similar catalytic properties to human protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase that also binds the common plant herbicide, <b>acifluorfen.</b> In the native structure, the planar porphyrinogen substrate is mimicked by a Tween 20 molecule, tracing three sides of the macrocycle. In contrast, <b>acifluorfen</b> does not mimic the planarity of the substrate but is accommodated by {{the shape of the}} binding pocket and held in place by electrostatic and aromatic interactions. A hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged residues suggests the position of the membrane anchor, differing from the one proposed for the tobacco mitochondrial protoporphyrinogen oxidase. Interestingly, there is a discrepancy between the dimerization state of the protein in solution and in the crystal. Conserved structural features are discussed in relation to a number of South African variegate porphyria-causing mutations in the human enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Potential US castor {{production}} is limited due {{to only one}} labeled herbicide (trifluralin). Field studies were conducted at two Texas locations during 2008 and 2009 to evaluate postemergence herbicides for castor tolerance and weed control efficacy. Clethodim and fluazifop-P-butyl caused no castor stunting while <b>acifluorfen,</b> bentazon, imazethapyr, and lactofen caused stunting which ranged from 5 to 46 %. Imazapic and 2, 4 -DB caused the greatest stunting (44 to 99 %) and resulted in castor yields of 0 to 45 % of the untreated check. <b>Acifluorfen,</b> imazapic, imazethapyr, lactofen, and 2, 4 -DB controlled at least 80 % smellmelon (Cucumis melo L. var. Dudaim Naud.) while clethodim and fluazifop-P-butyl controlled at least 98 % Texas millet [Urochloa texana (Buckl.) R. Webster]. Imazapic and imazethapyr provided 57 to 75 % Texas millet control. Results suggest that castor tolerance to the graminicides, clethodim, and fluazifop-P-butyl is high; however, castor injury and yield reductions with the postemergence applications of broadleaf herbicides suggest that these herbicides {{should not be used}} in castor production...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of three common herbicides, paraquat, <b>acifluorfen</b> and alachlor, with spinach chloroplast photosystem II (PS II) was investigated by measuring LH {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spin-lattice relaxation rates, transient nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) and NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra. Binding to PS II was detected by (i) the enhancement of single-selective relaxation rates and (ii) the decrease in the optimal mixing time providing maximal cross-peak intensity in NOESY spectra. Titration of relaxation enhancements was {{used to calculate the}} dissociation constants (K-d) from the bound state for paraquat (K-d = 292 +/- 71 mu M- 1) and <b>acifluorfen</b> (K-d = 311 +/- 58 mu M- 1). A similar K-d was apparent for alachlor. Double-selective relaxation rates allowed the isolation of dipolar relaxation terms between selected proton pairs wherefrom dynamic features of the bound state were evaluated. In all cases the motional correlation time of bound herbicide (tau(c) = 0. 1 - 0. 4 ns at 300 K) was found two orders of magnitude slower than in the free-solution state. In the case of alachlor the E and Z isomers were observed to bind differently to PS II and a change in conformation could be hypothesized...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate effects of selected herbicides on hatching of free eggs of the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines. The herbicides used were Atrazine (atrazine), Basagran (bentazon), Bladex (cyanazine), Blazer (<b>acifluorfen),</b> Command (clomazone), Lasso (alachlor), Sonalan (ethalfluralin), and Treflan (trifluralin). Treatments comprised two concentrations of commercial herbicide formulations and deionized water and 3. 14 mM zinc sulfate as negative and positive controls, respectively. Eggs were extracted from females and cysts, surface disinfested, and incubated in herbicide or control solutions at 25 ± 2 C in darkness. Hatched second-stage juveniles were counted every other day for 24 days. Hatching of H. glycines eggs in 50 and 500 [mu]g/ml Blazer was 42 to 67 % less than that in deionized water and 6 l to 78 % less than that in zinc sulfate solution. Zinc sulfate significantly increased hatching activity in 50 [mu]g/ml but not 500 [mu]g/ml Blazer. The other herbicides tested at various concentrations had no significant effect on egg hatching. The specific component of Blazer inhibiting egg hatching is unknown. Suppression of hatching by Blazer indicates that this postemergence soybean herbicide may have a potential role in managing H. glycines.

40|$|Repeated use of protox-inhibiting {{herbicides}} {{has resulted}} in a common waterhemp (Amaranthus rudis Sauer) biotype that survived lactofen applied up to 10 times the labeled rate. Field and greenhouse research evaluated control options for this biotype of common waterhemp. In the field, PRE applications of flumioxazin at 72 [*]g ai ha− 1, sulfentrazone at 240 [*]g ai ha− 1, and isoxaflutole at 70 [*]g ai ha− 1 controlled common waterhemp > 90 % up to 6 weeks after treatment. POST applications of fomesafen at 330 [*]g[*]ai ha− 1, lactofen at 220 [*]g ai ha− 1, and <b>acifluorfen</b> at 420 [*]g ai ha− 1 resulted in < 60 % visual control of common waterhemp, but differences were detected among herbicides. In the greenhouse, glyphosate was the only herbicide that controlled protox resistant waterhemp. The majority of herbicide activity from POST flumioxazin, fomesafen, <b>acifluorfen,</b> and lactofen was from foliar placement, but control was less than 40 % regardless of placement. Control of common waterhemp seeded at weekly intervals after herbicide treatment with flumioxazin, fomesafen, sulfentrazone, atrazine, and isoxaflutole exceeded 85 % at 0 weeks after herbicide application (WAHA), while control with isoxaflutole was greater than 60 % 6 WAHA.

Whole leaves sprayed with the diphenyl ether herbicide <b>Acifluorfen</b> and maintained {{in the light}} developed small necrotic lesions and accumulated isoflavone aglycones, isoflavone glucosides, and pterocarpans. Isoflavonoid accumulation was preceded by induced activity for chalcone synthase (CHS) and by increased activity for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and UDP-glucose:isoflavone 7 -O-glucosyl transferase (IGT). PAL and CHS activity was highest between 24 and 30 hours after treatment, isoflavone aglycones and pterocarpans at 48 hours, IGT at 72 hours, and isoflavone glucosides at 96 hours...|$|E
