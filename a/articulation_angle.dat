40|$|The zygapophyses and zygosphene–zygantrum articulations of snake {{vertebrae}} are {{hypothesized to}} restrict or eliminate vertebral torsion. This hypothesis is apparently {{based solely on}} the inference of function from structure, despite the limitations of such inferences, as well as contradictory observations and measurements. In this study, I observed and measured axial torsion in gopher snakes, Pituophis melanoleucus. To examine the structural basis of axial torsion, I measured the vertebral <b>articulation</b> <b>angles</b> along the body and the insertion angles of five epaxial muscles. To examine torsion in a natural behavior, I digitized video images and measured the degree of apparent axial torsion during terrestrial lateral undulation. Finally, I measured the mechanical capacity of the vertebral joints for actual torsion over intervals of 10 vertebrae in fresh, skinned segments of the trunk. Vertebral <b>articulation</b> <b>angles</b> vary up to 30 ° and are associated with variation in torsional capacity along the trunk. The freely crawling P. melanoleucus twisted up to 2. 19 ° per vertebra, which produced substantial overall torsion when added over several vertebrae. The vertebral joints are mechanically capable of torsion up to 2. 89 ° per joint. Therefore, despite the mechanical restriction imposed by the complex articulations, vertebral torsion occurs in snakes and appears to be functionally important in several natural behaviors. Even in cases in which mechanical function appears to be narrowly constrained by morphology, specific functions should not be inferred solely from structural analyses. J.

40|$|Abstract — Even for {{experienced}} drivers {{handling a}} roll trailer with a passenger {{car is a}} difficult and often tedious task. Moreover, the driver needs {{to keep track of}} the trailer’s driving stability on unsteady roads. There are driver assistance systems that can simplify trajectory planning and observe the oscillation amplitude, but they require additional hardware. In this paper, we present a method for trailer detection and <b>articulation</b> <b>angle</b> measurement based on video data from a rear end wide-angle camera. It consists of two stages: to decide whether or not a trailer is coupled to the vehicle and to estimate its <b>articulation</b> <b>angle.</b> These calculations work on single video frames. The vehicle is therefore not required to be in motion. However, we stabilize the single frame estimations by temporal integration. We perform training and parameter optimization and eval-uate the accuracy of our approach by comparing the results to those of an articulation measurement unit attached to a test vehicle’s hitch. Results show that it can very reliably be determined whether or not a trailer is coupled to the vehicle. Furthermore, its articulation can be estimated with a mean error of less than two degrees.

40|$|AbstractTrucks with {{semi-trailers}} {{are widely}} used for transportation of goods due their low operation cost, but inherent to these vehicles are some problems such as a poor maneuverability. To minimize {{the effects of this}} disadvantage, among other solutions, the incorporation of steerable axles in the semitrailers has been proposed. This paper presents a steering equation, and a fuzzy-logic controller for a semi-trailer automatic forced-steering system to minimize the off-tracking and the total swept path width, resulting in an improvement of vehicle's maneuverability at low speeds.

Usage of a control allocation structure is one way to handle an over-actuated system, which is a system where there are more motion actuators than controlled motions. The A-double combination is in focus for the control allocation design, which is based on vehicle modelling using the Lagrange formulation. The control structure is tested in a simulation environment and evaluated by two test scenarios. For the selected configuration with 31 actuators, the control allocation method coordinates the desired motion for both large and small steer and <b>articulation</b> <b>angles.</b> The proposed control structure is shown to be convenient when the vehicle configuration, for example the number of actuators in the combination, is changed...|$|R

Rather than using the entire reaction control system (RCS) system to steer the spacecraft, we investigate the potential utilization of only thrust vectoring of the main ion engines for the required attitude control to follow the representative trajectory.

40|$|Background: Modern {{approach}} to hallux valgus deformations enables {{not only the}} stage treatment considering {{the magnitude of the}} deformity but also the objective evaluation of the results. We investigated the influence of the three most commonly used osteotomies on three most common demonstrative factors, especially proximal osteotomy on the distal metatasal <b>articulation</b> <b>angle.</b> Methods: Three groups were created regarding the magnitude of the deformation. X rays of 15 corrections in each group were reviewed (45 cases, 34 women, 2 men). Each group was treated with only one of the three osteotomies: distal chevron osteotomy (Ch), distal chevron osteotomy with medial edge (ChM) and proximal osteotomy (POT). The effect on the three most comonly used demonstrative factors were noted: first intermetatarsal angle (IM), hallux valgus angle (HV), distal metatarsal <b>articulation</b> <b>angle</b> (DMAA). The age and the demonstrative factors were compared pre- and postoperative, in and between the groups. Results: The correct, graded selection of the patients for the treatment was confirmed and false negative results excluded. Preoperative values of HV and DMAA are significantely different between three groups (p < 0. 001) while IM are not (p = 0. 118). Postoperative values of the HV and IM are significantely lower in all three groups (p < 0. 001). DMAA is statisticaly different (positive) postoperatively in the ChM group (p < 0. 001) but not in the Ch and POT groups (P = 0. 398; p = 0. 456). Conclusions: Modern approach on hallux valgus deformations enables stage treatment and objective evaluation of the results what is demonstrated by the effect of the osteotomies on the demonstrative factors. Further investigations of the factors not yet considered or even unknown are also possible as shown on the example of the difference between the expected and measured effect of POT on DMAA. </p...|$|E
40|$|Articulated {{vehicles}} {{are known to}} exhibit appreciable yaw oscillations during high-speed directional maneuvers. Excessive vehicle off-tracking of multiple axle semitrailers causes rapid tire wear and poor maneuverability at low speeds. The concepts in articulation damping and forced-steering of the semitrailer axles are investigated to achieve improved low speed maneuverability as well as high speed directional control performance of the vehicle. The concept of a damped articulation mechanism is introduced and its potential benefits in limiting the yaw and lateral oscillations of semi-trailer are investigated. Different force-steering algorithms are formulated to achieve both improved low- and medium-speed maneuvrability and high-speed directional control performance. A nonlinear yaw plane model of an articulated vehicle with a multiple axles semitrailer comprising two articulation dampers and forced-steering of a semitrailer axle is formulated. The cornering forces and aligning moments of a radial truck tire are characterized by a nonlinear function in normal load, side-slip angle and pneumatic trail. The damping forces and moments acting on the sprung masses due to the articulation dampers are derived from the kinematic and dynamic analysis of the articulation mechanism. The equations of motion of the vehicle are solved for typical low-speed cornering and high-speed lane-change and evasive maneuvers. A parametric study is performed to establish the influence of articulation damping coefficients on the magnitude of lateral and yaw oscillations of the semitrailer. The {{results of the study}} show that the yaw and lateral oscillations encountered during high speed directional maneuvers can be significantly reduced by the articulation dampers. The low- and medium-speed maneuvrability and high-speed directional dynamics of the vehicle are further investigated using forced-steering of a semitrailer axle, assuming proportional control and negligible generator dynamics. The results are discussed to highlight the influence of the location of the forced-steering axle, feedback variables and control gains. The study showed that a forced-steering algorithm based on <b>articulation</b> <b>angle</b> and speed sensitive <b>articulation</b> <b>angle</b> offers considerable potentials in realizing both the improved low speed maneuvrability and high-speed directional control performance...|$|E

50|$|Double Cardan joints {{are similar}} to double Cardan shafts, except that {{the length of the}} {{intermediate}} shaft is shortened leaving only the yokes; this effectively allows the two Hooke's joints to be mounted back to back. DCJs are typically used in steering columns, as they eliminate the need to correctly phase the universal joints at the ends of the intermediate shaft (IS), which eases packaging of the IS around the other components in the engine bay of the car. They are also used to replace Rzeppa style constant-velocity joints in applications where high <b>articulation</b> <b>angles,</b> or impulsive torque loads are common, such as the driveshafts and halfshafts of rugged four wheel drive vehicles. Double Cardan joints require a centering element that will maintain equal angles between the driven and driving shafts for true constant velocity rotation. This centering device requires additional torque to accelerate the internals of the joint and does generate some additional vibration at higher speeds.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{solution}} to the problem of poor path-following performance of high capacity transport (HCT) vehicles, such as A-double combinations, causing safety issue for the vulnerable road users during low-speed turning maneuvers. An advanced control strategy is developed which only demands the axles of the converter dolly of such vehicle to be actively steerable so that existing tractor and semitrailers can be used without any further modification. The control strategy described in this paper allows the change of forward speed and even to stop the vehicle completely during the turning maneuver without any performance degradation. The controller utilizes the delays of tractor front axle steering <b>angle</b> and the <b>articulation</b> <b>angles</b> measured not in traditional time but in path-distance domain. The optimal controller is achieved using particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. Finally the optimal vehicle performance is compared with a baseline non-steerable converter dolly case and also with a proportional control case.

40|$|This report {{presents}} single-track models representing an A-double vehicle combination. The equations {{of motion}} are expressed relative the center of mass for the first vehicle unit and are derived using Lagrangian formalism. The symbolic manipulations of the equations have been done using the software Mathematica. The model derived in this report {{is intended to be}} valid for studies of vehicle cornering in high speed with moderate lateral and longitudinal acceleration levels. In order to keep the model complexity as low as possible, the derived {{equations of motion}} are simplified. The steering <b>angle</b> and the <b>articulation</b> <b>angles</b> of the towed vehicle units are assumed to be small. All products of the steering angle, the yaw rate of the first unit and the <b>articulation</b> <b>angles</b> and their time derivatives are set to zero. Further, the representation of longitudinal vehicle velocity leads to different level of model complexity. Firstly, the longitudinal velocity is assumed to be constant. Together {{with the use of a}} linear lateral tyre model this results in a fully linear vehicle model, consisting of eight states and one input. Secondly, the longitudinal velocity is allowed to be varying and is represented as a model state variable. Also here a linear lateral tyre model is used. The resulting vehicle model becomes non-linear, consisting of nine states and six inputs. Further simplifications of the longitudinal dynamics is carried out by assuming e. g. slowly varying longitudinal velocity and longitudinal forces only on the towing unit. This results in a non-linear model consisting of nine states and two inputs. This model is to be compared with the fully linear model. Realistic linear tyre parameters are found by tuning the derived linear single-track model with results from a high fidelity vehicle model developed at Volvo Group Trucks Technology (VGTT). The tuning was made using the software Matlab and a built-in Genetic Algorithm(GA), where the summarized squared difference in yaw rate gain for vehicle units was minimized. The performance of the derived vehicle model, including the difference in treatment of the longitudinal velocity, is evaluated in a comparison with the high fidelity model developed at VGTT. The open-loop analysis carried out in the comparison are step steer response analysis, single-sine steer response analysis, braking in a turn analysis (ISO 14794) ...|$|R

40|$|Owing {{to their}} high mass centre, {{relatively}} soft tyres, extreme {{variations in the}} load and load distributions during work cycles and greater flexibility of the steering system, the articulated steer vehicles (ASV) exhibit lower directional stability limits compared to vehicles with conventional steering. In this study, a kineto-dynamic model of the frame steering mechanism is formulated {{in conjunction with a}} nonlinear yaw-plane model of an articulated dump-truck. The validity of the model is demonstrated based on the available measured data. The proposed model is initially analysed to derive response characteristics of the steering system in terms of <b>articulation</b> <b>angle,</b> valve opening, strut orientations and deflections, fluid pressures and resultant strut forces and torque. The influences of variations in selected operating and design parameters on the steering system responses are investigated under a steady-turning and pulse steering inputs. The results provide important design guidelines with regard to kinematic and dynamic parameters of the steering mechanism and show that the lateral stability of the ASV is strongly influenced by the effective damping of the steering mechanism which is determined by kineto-dynamic characteristics of the articulated steering system including leakage flows across the struts piston, valve flow characteristics and struts orientations...|$|E

A numerical analysis of two plunging types of CV joints, tripod joint(TJ) and very low axial tripod joint(VTJ), is conducted using the commercial program DAFUL. User-defined subroutines of a friction model illustrating the contacted parts of the outboard and inboard joint are subsequently developed to overcome the numerical instability and improve the solution performance. The Coulomb friction effect is applied to describe the contact models of the lubricated parts in the rolling and sliding mechanisms.

The linear analysis and simulations are carried out with a constant longitudinal velocity of 80 Kph for the passive vehicle, i. e. no steering on the dolly or semitrailer.

That is, we have a yaw rate RWA higher than 1 when for frequencies around 0. 4 Hz. We also observe a lateral acceleration gain, between 0. 1 and 1 Hz, for the dolly and semitrailer. Moreover, the phase angle has a higher frequency dependence for the dolly and semitrailer both for yaw rate and lateral acceleration.

The contents of the thesis work involve investigation and evaluation of an existing simple vehicle model and the design and evaluation of an articulation damping controller. The goal is a better behavior of the bus than when using the current system used in Scania buses (ACS 5). The vehicle model is examined by analyzing the effects {{of some of the}} various approximationsindividually. The conclusion is that the various approximations are acceptable for the focus situations, especially since the vehicle model is not used in such a manner that it needs to be precise. The simulation environment, including an extended vehicle model and a road-follow algorithm is described. It is also discussed what in the results, based on simulations, can and cannot be used to draw conclusions from. The controller is tested by examining different control error options, where the control error is either the <b>articulation</b> <b>angle,</b> articulation angular velocity or a combination of both.

Firstly, an environment model based on a mining Geographic Information System (GIS) map is established, and then combined with improved A * algorithm, the underground global path planning problem of the intelligent Load Haul Dump (LHD) is solved. In this paper, for the articulated structure, the method of expanding nodes by <b>articulation</b> <b>angle</b> is adopted to make expanded nodes meet the trajectory characteristics.

40|$|Here a {{conceptual}} framework is provided for analysing {{the role of the}} flight muscles in stability and control. Stability usually refers to the tendency of a system to return to a characteristic reference state, whether static, as in gliding, or oscillatory, as in flapping. Asymptotic Lyapunov stability and asymptotic orbital stability as formal definitions of gliding and flapping flight stability, respectively, are discussed and a limit cycle control analogy for flapping flight control proposed. Stability can arise inherently or through correctional control. Conceptually, inherent stability is that which would arise if all body parts were rigid and all <b>articulation</b> <b>angles</b> were constants (gliding) or periodic functions (flapping), both of which require muscular effort. Pose can be maintained during disturbances by neural feedback or isometric contraction of tonic muscles: cyclic pose changes can be buffered by neural feedback or viscous damping by phasic muscles. Correctional control serves to drive the system towards its reference state, which will usually involve a phasic response, if only because of the tendency of flying bodies to oscillate during disturbances. Muscles involved in correctional control must therefore be tuned to the characteristic frequencies of the system. Furthermore, in manoeuvre control, these frequencies set an upper limit on the timescales on which control inputs can be effective. Flight muscle physiology should therefore be evolutionarily co-tuned with the morphological parameters of the system that determine its frequency response. Understanding this fully will require us to integrate internal models of physiology with external models of flight dynamics. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2005...|$|R

The main-outcomes are a ready-to-use interface for algorithm development in MATLAB/Simulink that allows to request steering angles individually for each axle and supplies feedback for all relevant parameters (e. g. <b>articulation</b> <b>angle</b> between different units of combination, steering angle of tractor) for their computation in real-time. On top of that a concept for requesting braking torques from the dolly's braking system for future projects was developed. To ensure safety of the whole combination, especially during track-tests, a supervisor system was implemented to limit the request based on hardware limitations. Additionally an inertial measurement unit setup was developed and implemented for use on the combination to gather suficient data {{for each of the}} combination's independently moving units dynamic behavior during testing to calibrate and parametrize the tested algorithms. In the scope of this thesis the dolly was modified to conduct hardware-in-the-loop simulations. All necessary systems to achieve this were built as prototypes for a workshop test-environment limiting the use-case to a standing-system. Reliable track-proof solutions were developed and commissioned for manufacturing, so that track-testing is possible soon after...|$|E
40|$|Yaw {{instability}} was {{studied for}} five tractor-semitrailer configurations using EDVDS and SIMON in the HVE 4. 10 operating system. Steady-state {{analyses were performed}} on the vehicle configurations by implementing a series of trapezoidal steer inputs, roll angles, <b>articulation</b> <b>angle</b> and forward velocity were recorded. Steer angles were incrementally increased until the vehicle experienced yaw divergence, rollover or steer tire saturation. The five vehicle configurations were: 1. 3 -axle tractor with loaded 53 -foot semitrailer, nominal GVW of 80, 000 lbs 2. 3 -axle tractor with partially loaded 53 -foot semitrailer, nominal GVW of 67, 000 lbs 3. 2 -axle tractor with partially loaded 53 -foot semitrailer, nominal GVW of 65, 000 lbs 4. 2 -axle tractor with same trailer as 3 and 4 above, with slider position moved forward 5. 2 -axle tractor with fully loaded 27 -foot semitrailer, nominal GVW of 45, 000 lbs Handling diagrams were prepared for each vehicle configuration using the data obtained from EDVDS and SIMON. The five vehicle configurations were compared to each other using EDVDS data and again using SIMON data. Relative stability of each configuration was compared. The results for each individual configuration as reported by EDVDS and SIMON were also compared. SIMON and EDVDS revealed similar trends among the vehicle configurations. EDVDS and SIMON demonstrated rather different responses within {{the sensitivity of the}} handling diagrams. The vehicles modeled in SIMON tended to be more neutral steer than those modeled in EDVDS. That is, 2 -axle tractor configurations exhibited more oversteer in EDVDS than in SIMON and 3 -axle tractor configurations tended to exhibit more understeer in EDVDS than in SIMON. A unique characteristic of the vehicle response was observed in the SIMON runs. Between approximately. 07 and. 12 g’s, a spike in the yaw rate was observed in all five runs...|$|E
40|$|The {{handling}} and yaw stability characteristics of passenger vehicles are drastically changed when towing a trailer, {{which can lead}} to unsafe oscillations in the trailer yaw, known as trailer sway. This thesis examines the feasibility of using lateral articulation of the hitch ball to reduce sway behavior in passenger-sized tractor-trailer configurations. An articulating hitch ball design has the advantage of not being dependent on the trailer being towed, providing stability improvements to the wide variety of trailers that a passenger vehicle may tow over its life cycle. Changes in the lateral position of the hitch relative to the tractor create dynamic changes to the heading angle of the trailer relative to the tractor, which act as compensating steering inputs into the system. To examine the effectiveness of this method, a linear handling model was developed to predict the system response with different trailer configurations and feedback methods. This model was simulated with various feedback controllers, and the modeling was validated using a model constructed in MapleSim, a high-fidelity multibody simulation tool. After establishing the required performance characteristics of the active hitch, a prototype was designed, manufactured, and tested in a full scale tractor-trailer combination. The modeling techniques showed good agreement with the physical testing, where the control design of proportional feedback on the trailer <b>articulation</b> <b>angle</b> provided improved yaw stability across many trailer configurations. The simple controller design is adaptable to driving conditions and requires minimal measurements of vehicle states. The performance of the active hitch prototype is best shown in a response to a steering impulse at 65 km/h, where a highly unstable trailer causes steady state oscillation without control, and settles in under 4 seconds with control active...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A new {{approach}} to track bicycles from imagery sensor data is proposed. It is based on detecting ellipsoids in the images, and treat these pair-wise using a dynamic bicycle model. One important application area is in automotive collision avoidance systems, where no dedicated systems for bicyclists yet exist and where very few theoretical studies have been published. Possible conflicts can be predicted from {{the position and velocity}} state in the model, but also from the steering wheel <b>articulation</b> and roll <b>angle</b> that indicate yaw changes before the velocity vector changes. An algorithm is proposed which consists of an ellipsoid detection and estimation algorithm and a particle filter. A simulation study of three critical single target scenarios is presented, and the algorithm is shown to produce excellent state estimates. An experiment using a stationary camera and the particle filter for state estimation is performed and has shown encouraging results...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the middle}} line below the chin can be felt {{the body of the}} hyoid bone, just below which is the {{prominence}} of the thyroid cartilage called [...] "Adam's apple", better marked in men than in women. Also neck lines marks appear at a later age as a phenomenon of skin wrinkle. Still lower the cricoid cartilage is easily felt, while between this and the suprasternal notch the trachea and isthmus of the thyroid gland may be made out. At the side the outline of the sternomastoid muscle is the most striking mark; it divides the anterior triangle of the neck from the posterior. The upper part of the former contains the submaxillary gland also known as the submandibular glands, which lies just below the posterior half of the body of the jaw. The line of the common and the external carotid arteries may be marked by joining the sterno-clavicular <b>articulation</b> to the <b>angle</b> of the jaw.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports an {{empirical}} investigation {{in which participants}} produced a set of stroke gestures {{with varying degrees of}} complexity and in different target sizes using both the finger and the pen. The recorded gestures were then analyzed according to multiple measures characterizing many aspects of stroke gestures. Our findings were as follows: (1) Finger drawn gestures were quite different to pen drawn gestures in basic measures including size ratio and average speed. Finger drawn gestures tended to be larger and faster than pen drawn gestures. They also differed in shape geometry as measured by, for example, aperture of closed gestures, corner shape distance and intersecting points deviation; (2) Pen drawn gestures and finger drawn gestures were similar in several measures including <b>articulation</b> time, indicative <b>angle</b> difference, axial symmetry and proportional shape distance; (3) There were interaction effects between gesture implement (finger vs. pen) and target gesture size and gesture complexity. Our findings show that half of the features we tested were performed well enough by the finger. This finding suggests that “finger friendly ” systems should exploit these features when designing finger interfaces and avoid using the other features in which the finger does not perform as well as the pen.
