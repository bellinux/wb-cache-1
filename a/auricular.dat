5|$|The {{outer ear}} is {{supplied}} {{by a number}} of arteries. The posterior <b>auricular</b> artery provides the majority of the blood supply. The anterior <b>auricular</b> arteries provide some supply to the outer rim of the ear and scalp behind it. The posterior <b>auricular</b> artery is a direct branch of the external carotid artery, and the anterior <b>auricular</b> arteries are branches from the superficial temporal artery. The occipital artery also plays a role.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} is {{supplied}} by the mastoid branch of either the occipital or posterior <b>auricular</b> arteries and the deep <b>auricular</b> artery, {{a branch of the}} maxillary artery. Other arteries which are present but play a smaller role include branches of the middle meningeal artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, internal carotid artery, and the artery of the pterygoid canal.|$|E
5|$|Two sets {{of muscles}} are {{associated}} with the outer ear: the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. In some mammals, these muscles can adjust the direction of the pinna. In humans, these muscles have little or no effect. The ear muscles are supplied by the facial nerve, which also supplies sensation to the skin of the ear itself, {{as well as to the}} external ear cavity. The great <b>auricular</b> nerve, <b>auricular</b> nerve, auriculotemporal nerve, and lesser and greater occipital nerves of the cervical plexus all supply sensation to parts of the outer ear and the surrounding skin.|$|E
50|$|The {{feathers}} of the breast, abdomen, and throat are yellow; {{those of the}} coverts, primaries, secondaries, scapulars, <b>auriculars,</b> lores, and tail are black; the crown feathers are russet. It is unique among its conspecifics {{because it has a}} jet black back, wing and tail.|$|R
60|$|They {{preferred}} the former. And as they there kneeled, in vain did men with sharp ears (who abound in all courts) prick their <b>auriculars,</b> to list to that strange crackling and firing off of bone balls and sockets, ever incident to the genuflections of rheumatic courtiers.|$|R

Geographic {{distribution}} of plumage color patterns among taxa of the Cyphorhinus arada complex: (A) {{distribution of}} forehead and crown, nape, and chin, throat and chest color patterns; (B) {{distribution of the}} <b>auriculars,</b> sides of neck and superciliary color patterns; (C) distribution of the belly, flanks and crissum color patterns...|$|R
5|$|The {{inner ear}} is {{supplied}} by the anterior tympanic branch of the maxillary artery; the stylomastoid branch of the posterior <b>auricular</b> artery; the petrosal branch of middle meningeal artery; and the labyrinthine artery, arising from either the anterior inferior cerebellar artery or the basilar artery.|$|E
5|$|The holotype {{and only}} known specimen, {{which is in}} very poor condition, is {{preserved}} in the Museum d'Histoire Naturel de Neuchâtel as specimen MHNN 91.2426. It has five <b>auricular</b> lobules {{in front of the}} ears {{on each side of the}} head, 39 rows of scales around the midbody, keels on its dorsal scales, and the third supraocular scale in contact with the frontal scale, all characters which align it with Trachylepis rather than Mabuya. The other putative mainland South American Trachylepis, T.maculata, has five instead of three keels, 32 to 34 midbody scales, and separated parietal scales. T.tschudii agrees with the Noronha skink in size, coloration, numbers of scales, and discrete characters, such as having the supranasal, parietal, and prefrontal scales all in contact.|$|E
5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the <b>auricular</b> hillocks do not develop properly. The ear canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs {{of the rest of the}} ear.|$|E
50|$|Its plumage {{is mostly}} pale blue, with a purplish-blue crown, {{distinctive}} dark spots across the chest, dark lores and lower <b>auriculars.</b> The mantle is mottled greenish-blue and black. The wings and tail are black with blue edgings. The bill is gray {{with a dark}} tip. Cabanis's tanagers utter several sibilant vocalizations, hard trill and twitters.|$|R
50|$|The upper parts, nape, <b>auriculars,</b> dorsum, tertials, wing covers, rump, upper-tail, and rectrices {{are bright}} green. The forehead, {{anterior}} crown, and ores are a pale blue. The malar area, breast, belly, and under-tail are a paler more yellowish green. No sexual dimorphism {{has been described}} as yet, although this could be because so {{little is known about the}} species.|$|R
50|$|Hearing is birds' {{second most}} {{important}} sense and their ears are funnel-shaped to focus sound. The ears are located slightly behind and below the eyes, and they are covered with soft feathers - the <b>auriculars</b> - for protection. The shape of a bird's head can also affect its hearing, such as owls, whose facial discs help direct sound toward their ears.|$|R
5|$|The Noronha skink {{is covered}} with light and dark spots above, but there is {{substantial}} variation in the precise colors. There are no longitudinal stripes. The scales on the underparts are yellowish or grayish. The eyelids are white to yellow. It has a small head with small nostrils, which are placed far to the front {{at the sides of}} the head. The mouth contains small and conical teeth and a thin but well-developed tongue. The eyes are small and placed laterally and contain dark, rounded irises. There are three to five well-developed <b>auricular</b> lobules (small projections) in front of the ears; these lobules are absent in true Mabuya. The hindlimbs are longer and stronger than the forelimbs, which are small. The tail is longer than the body and is muscular but very brittle. It is nearly cylindrical in form and tapers towards the end.|$|E
5|$|Continental {{reformer}} Philipp Melanchthon {{was aware}} that he was very much admired by Henry. In early 1539, Melanchthon wrote several letters to Henry criticising his views on religion, in particular his support of clerical celibacy. By late April another delegation from the Lutheran princes arrived to build on Melanchthon's exhortations. Cromwell {{wrote a letter to the}} king in support of the new Lutheran mission. However, the king had begun to change his stance and concentrated on wooing conservative opinion in England rather than reaching out to the Lutherans. On 28 April 1539, Parliament met for the first time in three years. Cranmer was present, but Cromwell was unable to attend due to ill health. On 5 May the House of Lords created a committee with the customary religious balance between conservatives and reformers to examine and determine doctrine. However, the committee was given little time to do the detailed work needed for a thorough revision. On 16 May, the Duke of Norfolk noted that the committee had not agreed on anything, and proposed that the Lords examine six doctrinal questions—which eventually formed the basis of the Six Articles. They affirmed the conservative interpretation of doctrines such as the real presence, clerical celibacy, and the necessity of <b>auricular</b> confession, the private confession of sins to a priest. As the Act of the Six Articles neared passage in Parliament, Cranmer moved his wife and children out of England to safety. Up until this time, the family was kept quietly hidden, most likely in Ford Palace in Kent. The Act passed Parliament at the end of June and it forced Latimer and Nicholas Shaxton to resign their dioceses given their outspoken opposition to the measure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Auricular</b> {{confession}} was discontinued.|$|E
50|$|On the tan form, {{the crown}} is dark brown with a tan central stripe. The {{supercilium}} is tan as well. The <b>auriculars</b> are gray/light brown with the upper edge forming a brown eye line. Both variations feature dark eyes, a white throat, yellow lores and gray bill. There is variation and some individuals may show dark lateral stripes of {{each side of}} the throat.|$|R
50|$|At between 39 and 43 cm, this duck is {{slightly}} larger and longer-tailed than the common teal. The breeding male is unmistakable, with a striking green nape, yellow and black <b>auriculars,</b> neck, and throat. It has a dark crown, and its breast is light brown with dark spots. It has long dropping dark scapulars, and its grey sides are {{set off on}} the front and rear with white bars..|$|R
50|$|Adults are short-necked, {{relatively}} short-legged and stout herons; the two extant species {{both have}} a black crown and a whitish belly, while the wings, chest, neck and <b>auriculars</b> are grey or rufous depending on the species. Young birds are brown, flecked with white and grey, and are quite similar {{to each other in}} the extant species. At least some of the extinct Mascarenes taxa appear to have retained this juvenile plumage in adult birds.|$|R

25|$|The {{first case}} of <b>auricular</b> myiasis (on the outer ear) {{on a human}} was {{reported}} in Iran in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Mower {{continues}} his {{research in the}} biomechanical engineering laboratories at Johns Hopkins University. His current work focuses on the correction of <b>auricular</b> fibrillation.|$|E
50|$|The {{chestnut}}-capped thrush has a black {{back and}} a white belly with black spots. As its common name suggests, it has a chestnut cap. Its face is black with a white mark on the cheeks and another on the lores. The superficially similar chestnut-backed thrush is substantially larger when seen alongside one another, and has a black crown and rufous back, whereas the Enggano thrush has an olive-ochre back and little or no white on the lores and <b>auriculars.</b>|$|R
50|$|The sulphur-winged parakeet is 23 cm {{long and}} weighs 75 g. The adult is mainly green. Scaled with orange-yellow {{on the head}} and chest. There is a red spot on the <b>auriculars</b> and the tail is broadly tipped dull red (entirely dull red from below). The outer {{primaries}} are blue, but the most obvious feature in flight is the extensive yellow on the inner wing. Young birds are similar to the adults, but duller and with much less yellow in the wing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{adults are}} {{generally}} {{identified by the}} presence of heavy horizontal barring across their abdomen, large [...] "tear-drop" [...] shaped markings on their breast (more pronounced in the females) extending up into the <b>auriculars,</b> a white, smokey-white, or grayish background color on the breast (as opposed to the salmon to orangish background color on most other subspecies), very broad malar stripe to a full dark cap, and wider, stronger mandibles than is commonly seen in the species as a whole.|$|R
25|$|In {{experiments}} on anesthetized cats, Papp and Szekeres found that synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) raised the thresholds for <b>auricular</b> and ventricular fibrillation, {{an indication of}} anti-arrhythmic properties.|$|E
25|$|Cancer in the {{bronchial}} tree {{is usually}} painless, but ear and facial pain {{on one side}} of the head has been reported in some patients. This pain is referred via the <b>auricular</b> branch of the vagus nerve.|$|E
25|$|Wells {{was elected}} to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1814, and the same year the Royal Society of London awarded him the Rumford Medal for his Essay on Dew. He died in 1817 after {{suffering}} symptoms of heart malfunction (<b>auricular</b> fibrillation).|$|E
50|$|Total length ca. 22 cm (8½ in). As {{other members}} of the Pyrrhura picta complex, it is a long-tailed mainly green parakeet with a dark red belly, rump and tail-tip (tail all dark red from below), pale grey scaling to the chest, a whitish or dull buff patch on the <b>auriculars</b> and bluish remiges. The cheeks and crown are dark dusky-maroon (often appears almost blackish). Unlike {{other members of}} the P. picta complex, it lacks any bright red or blue to the head (but see Taxonomy). The legs are dark greyish.|$|R
50|$|The yellow-olive flatbill or {{yellow-olive flycatcher}} (Tolmomyias sulphurescens) is {{a species of}} bird in the family Tyrannidae. It is found in {{tropical}} and subtopical forest and woodland in Central and South America, but over its range there are significant variations in plumage, iris-colour and voice, leading to speculations {{that more than one}} species is involved. Its plumage is overall greenish-yellow, the lores are whitish, the crown is often greyish and some subspecies have a dusky patch on the <b>auriculars.</b> The flat bill is black above and pale pinkish or greyish below; similar to the yellow-margined flatbill, but unlike the grey-crowned flatbill.|$|R
50|$|The {{wrinkled}} hornbill {{is around}} 70 cm long, {{and has a}} very large bill that is fused to the skull. It has mainly black plumage, a blue eye-ring, and a broadly white or rufous-tipped tail. The male and female have different head and bill patterns. Males have bright yellow feathers on the <b>auriculars,</b> cheeks, throat, neck-sides and chest, but these areas are black in the female, except for the blue throat. The bill of the male is yellow with a red base and casque, and a brownish basal half of the lower mandible. The bill and casque of the female is almost entirely yellow.|$|R
25|$|The main medical {{concern with}} this species {{is that it}} causes {{accidental}} enteric, urinary, <b>auricular,</b> and urogenital myiasis. Myiasis is the infestation of animals or humans, where dipterous fly larvae feed on the host's necrotic or living tissue. This is prevalent in small children and bedridden adults living in unsanitary conditions.|$|E
25|$|Its {{arterial}} blood supply {{is provided by}} branches of the external carotid artery, predominately the superficial temporal branch. Other branches of the external carotid artery, namely the deep <b>auricular</b> artery, anterior tympanic artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, and maxillary artery, may {{also contribute to the}} {{arterial blood}} supply of the joint.|$|E
25|$|Auriculotherapy, {{commonly}} known as ear acupuncture, <b>auricular</b> acupuncture, or auriculoacupuncture, is considered to date back to ancient China. It involves inserting needles to stimulate points on the outer ear. The modern approach was developed in France during the early 1950s. There is no scientific evidence that it can cure disease; the evidence of effectiveness is negligible.|$|E
50|$|There exists {{no sexual}} {{dimorphism}} within the species. Adult turquoise jays are mainly a vibrant, blue-green color {{that can change}} depending on the lighting. The underside of the wings and tail are black. The turquoise jay has a thick, black face mask that extends to the <b>auriculars</b> and connects to a thin, black collar the wraps around the throat but does not extend around the nape of the neck. The forecrown of the turquoise jay is very light and almost white in color. The iris of the bird is brown while the legs, feet, and bill are all black. Juveniles have a duller color overall and lack the thin, black collar.|$|R
5000|$|The adult rufous-browed peppershrike is {{approximately}} 15 cm long and weighs 28 g. It is bull-headed with a thick, somewhat shrike-like bill, which typically is blackish below and pinkish-grey above. The head is grey {{with a strong}} rufous eyebrow. The crown is often tinged with brown. The upperparts are green, and the yellow throat and breast shade into a white belly. The subspecies ochrocephala from the south-eastern part of its range has a shorter rufous eyebrow and a brown-tinged crown, while the subspecies virenticeps, contrerasi and saturata from north-western Peru and western Ecuador have greenish-yellow (not grey, as in the [...] "typical" [...] subspecies) nape, <b>auriculars</b> and cheeks.|$|R
50|$|The red {{fox sparrow}} {{is a large}} sparrow with a length of 15-19 cm (6-7.5 inches), {{wingspan}} of 27 cm (10.5 inches) and an average weight of 32 grams (1.1 oz). The head is gray with a rufus crown <b>auriculars</b> or ear coverts. Throat is white with a rufus lateral stripe on each side. The lower bill is yellow while the top transitions from yellow at the bottom to black at the top. The breast has reddish brown streaks with a messy central spot. The streaks continue down the flanks but the belly is generally white. The combination of distinct rufus and gray streaks on the back with a gray rump is diagnostic. Sexes are morphologically similar.|$|R
