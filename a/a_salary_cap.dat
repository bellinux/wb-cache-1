5|$|Dick Versace, the Grizzlies' {{president}} of basketball operations, {{stated in the}} final Vancouver season {{that the company was}} losing US$40million per season. These numbers were questioned by Richard Peddie, CEO of the Raptors, as the Grizzlies had <b>a</b> <b>salary</b> <b>cap</b> of US$48million. Retrospectively, Heisley stated that he lost US$87million on owning the Grizzlies, although that included a US$30million relocation fee to the NBA. Versace stated that he felt that the team did not get sufficient support from the business community. Colin Jones, University of Victoria professor in sports economics, stated that it was difficult to attract corporate sponsors as long as the team was losing so many games; the Grizzlies lack of good draft picks lead to the team failing to win, thus losing revenue. He also noted that the team never sought help in the general business community regarding management issues.|$|E

5|$|The {{three decades}} after the 1952 Grey Cup victory have been called the Argonauts' Dark Ages. The team went thirty-one years between {{championship}} victories and nineteen without even making an appearance in the final. Part of the reason was <b>a</b> <b>salary</b> <b>cap</b> introduced in 1953 that cost them many talented players. For {{the first time in}} decades, they began ranking {{at the bottom of the}} Eastern Division. The management style under new owner John Bassett has also been blamed: young talent was traded or allowed to leave and the team could not form a nucleus of championship players; coaches came and went rapidly. Two notable events occurred off-field at the end of the 1950s: in 1958 the Argonauts became a founding member of the Canadian Football League and a year later found a new home at Exhibition Stadium.|$|E
5|$|By 2004, {{the owners}} were {{claiming}} that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues, {{and that the}} league as a whole lost over US$300 million in 2002–03. As a result, on September 15, 2004 Gary Bettman announced that the owners again locked the players out {{before the start of}} the 2004–05 season. On February 16, 2005, Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season. As with the 1994–95 lockout, the owners were again demanding <b>a</b> <b>salary</b> <b>cap,</b> which the players were unwilling to consider until the season was on the verge of being lost. The season's cancellation led to a revolt within the union. NHLPA president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin took charge of negotiations from executive director Bob Goodenow. By early July, the two sides had agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement. The deal featured a hard salary cap, linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues and a 24% rollback on salaries.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> hard <b>salary</b> <b>cap</b> {{is where}} the league sets a maximum amount of money allowed for player salaries, and no team can exceed that limit.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> soft <b>salary</b> <b>cap</b> has <b>a</b> set {{limit to}} player salaries, {{but there are}} several major {{exceptions}} that allow teams to exceed the <b>salary</b> <b>cap.</b> For example, {{in the case of}} the NBA, teams can exceed the <b>salary</b> <b>cap</b> when keeping players that are already on the team.|$|R

5|$|In 1910–11, the NHA {{contracted}} {{and imposed}} <b>a</b> <b>salary</b> <b>cap,</b> leading {{many of the}} Ottawa players to threaten to form a competing league. However, team owners controlled the rinks and the players accepted the new conditions. For Ottawa players, conditions did not deteriorate much as the club provided bonuses after the season. Ottawa gained revenge for the previous loss to Renfrew by defeating Renfrew 19–5. The team went 13–3 to win the NHA and inherit the Stanley Cup; Marty Walsh and Dubby Kerr led the goal scoring with 37 and 32 goals in 16 games. After the season Ottawa played two challenges, against Galt, winning 7–4, and against Port Arthur, winning 13–4. In the Port Arthur game Marty Walsh came close to matching Frank McGee's total, scoring ten goals. 1910–11 was the debut season of right winger Jack Darragh who scored 18 goals in 16 games.|$|E
5|$|The CFL re-gained {{relative}} {{stability in the}} 2000s, mostly thanks to enforcement of <b>a</b> <b>salary</b> <b>cap,</b> stricter standards of ownership, and increasingly lucrative television contracts negotiated with Canadian networks. The league has remained solely focused on its Canadian operations, with expansion efforts focused on returning a stable team to Ottawa. The first attempt at a replacement for the Rough Riders, the Ottawa Renegades, played from 2002 to 2005; in its last season, despite league resistance but without any other buyers, the Gliebermans purchased the franchise, then gave {{it back to the}} league, which suspended it prior to the 2006 season. After an extended delay due to stadium problems in Ottawa, the Ottawa Redblacks, who own the Rough Riders' history and trademarks, launched in 2014 and have so far been a success under the ownership of Jeff Hunt's consortium. Further expansion has been limited to one-off games such as Touchdown Atlantic and Northern Kickoff in more distant Canadian markets.|$|E
5|$|The players {{ultimately}} prevailed after a {{jury trial}} on their claims. That verdict, the pendency of other antitrust cases {{and the threat of}} a class action lawsuit filed by Reggie White, then with the Philadelphia Eagles, on behalf of all NFL players caused the parties to settle the antitrust cases and to agree on a formula that permitted free agency. In return, the owners received <b>a</b> <b>salary</b> <b>cap,</b> albeit one tied to a formula based on the players' share of total league revenues. The agreement also established a salary floorminimum payrolls all teams were obliged to pay. The settlement was presented to and approved by Judge Doty, who had also heard the McNeil antitrust case in 1993. Once the agreement was approved, the NFLPA reconstituted itself as a labor union and entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the league. The NFLPA and the league extended the 1993 agreement five times. The final extension came in March 2006 when it was extended through the 2010 season after the NFL owners voted 302 to accept the NFLPA's final proposal.|$|E

At that meeting, held at Bulldogs owner Ralph Hay's Hupmobile showroom in Canton, representatives of the Rock Island Independents, the Muncie Flyers, the Decatur Staleys, the Racine Cardinals, the Massillon Tigers, the Chicago Cardinals, and the Hammond Pros agreed to join the league. Representatives of the Buffalo All-Americans and Rochester Jeffersons could not attend the meeting, but sent letters to Hay asking {{to be included in the}} league. Team representatives changed the league's name slightly to the American Professional Football Association and elected officers, installing Jim Thorpe as president. Under the new league structure, teams created their schedules dynamically as the season progressed, and representatives of each team voted to determine the winner of the APFA trophy.|$|E
5|$|After the 2004–05 NHL lockout and the {{implementation}} of <b>a</b> <b>salary</b> <b>cap,</b> the Avalanche were forced to release some of their top players. Peter Forsberg and Adam Foote were lost to free agency to save room in the cap for Joe Sakic and Rob Blake. Although the salary cap was a blow {{to one of the}} highest spenders of the league, the Colorado Avalanche finished the 2005–06 regular season with a 43–30–9 record for 95 points, good enough to finish second in the Northwest Division, seven behind the Calgary Flames and tied with the Edmonton Oilers. The season paused in February for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. The Avalanche sent an NHL leading 11 players from eight countries. Finnish Antti Laaksonen earned the silver medal, while Ossi Vaananen ended up not playing because of an injury; Czech Milan Hejduk won a bronze medal. In the Western Conference Quarter-finals, Colorado beat the team with the second-best record in the Western Conference, the Dallas Stars, in five games. In the Conference Semi-finals, the Avalanche were swept for the first time ever, coming {{at the hands of the}} Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The day after the loss, Pierre Lacroix, who had been the general manager of the franchise since 1994 when they were in Quebec, resigned, where Francois Giguere was then hired as his replacement. Lacroix remained president of the franchise until Spring of 2013, when the team owner's son, Josh Kroenke, took over as team president and governor. Pierre Lacroix remains an advisor to the team.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{the players}} were locked out by the owners {{because of a lack}} of a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). The 1994–95 NHL lockout lasted 104days and {{resulted}} in the season's being shortened from a planned 84 games to 48. The owners insisted on <b>a</b> <b>salary</b> <b>cap,</b> changes to free agency and arbitration in the hopes of limiting escalating salaries, the union instead proposed a luxury tax system. Just as the entire season seemed to be lost, an 11th-hour deal was agreed on. The owners failed to achieve a full salary cap but the deal was initially hailed as a win for the owners. The deal was not enough to save two teams in Canada's smallest NHL markets. The revenue disparity between large and small market teams, exacerbated by the falling value of the Canadian Dollar, forced the Quebec Nordiques to move to Denver and become the Colorado Avalanche in 1995; the Winnipeg Jets relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, becoming the Coyotes, the next year. The Hartford Whalers followed, moving to Greensboro, NC and becoming the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997. The NHL continued its expansion into cities in the Southern United States. In 1998, the Nashville Predators joined the league, followed by the Atlanta Thrashers the following year. To further market their players, the NHL decided to have its players play in the Winter Olympics, starting in 1998, at the Nagano Games. In 2000, the league added two franchises, boosting the total number to 30. The NHL returned to Minnesota with the Wild and added the Blue Jackets in Columbus, Ohio.|$|E

25|$|On July 21, 2004, {{the league}} {{presented}} the NHLPA with six concepts to achieve cost certainty. These concepts {{are believed to}} have ranged from a hard, or inflexible, <b>salary</b> <b>cap</b> similar to the one used in the National Football League, to <b>a</b> soft <b>salary</b> <b>cap</b> with some capped exceptions like the one used in the National Basketball Association, to <b>a</b> centralized <b>salary</b> negotiation system similar to that used in the Arena Football League and Major League Soccer. According to Bettman, a luxury tax similar to the one used in Major League Baseball would not have satisfied the league's cost certainty objectives. Most sports commentators saw Bettman's plan as reasonable, but some critics pointed out that <b>a</b> hard <b>salary</b> <b>cap</b> without any revenue sharing was an attempt to gain the support of the big market teams, such as Toronto, Montreal, Detroit, the New York Rangers, Vancouver, and Philadelphia, teams that did not support Bettman during the 1994–95 lockout.|$|R
50|$|For the 2010 season, {{the weekly}} team <b>salary</b> <b>cap</b> was $3,000 per week. Any team in {{violation}} of the <b>salary</b> <b>cap</b> will be fined and could have either players suspended for the season or forfeiture of games in which they violated the cap.
