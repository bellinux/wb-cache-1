500|$|In 1963 on British television, Mona Best, {{with her}} son present, said of his dismissal: [...] "From the point of clash of personalities, well, {{probably}} that may be it because Peter did have a terrific fan club, you know, compared to the others. [...] I'll leave that for other people to say but {{from my point of}} view we haven't come here to sort of throw sticks and stones <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> because there is no really hard feeling. There was at first, but it's just the way that it was done that has annoyed us. If it had been done a bit more straightforward it would have been more to the mark." [...] Hunter Davies, in his authorised Beatles biography published in 1968, agreed: [...] "There is some justification for a little of Mrs. Best's anger. The sacking of Pete Best is one of the few murky incidents in the Beatles' history. There was something sneaky about the way it was done." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{time machine}} gets {{destroyed}} {{so the two}} Candaces go to the backyard to convince the boys to fix the current time machine in the museum and take them back, creating a paradox and as a result, the Candace from the bleak future(wearing a white lab coat {{as seen in the}} picture above) ceases to exist. The boys then fix the machine. Isabella says to Ferb that a rollercoaster ride and time travel was a bonus. The present Candace tags along with her future self, Phineas, Ferb, and Isabella as they travel to the future (while Candace [...] "finally" [...] busting them in the process, but the future Linda is not angry <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys,</b> saying she doesn't have jurisdiction to bust the boys anymore). As Candace and the boys talk to the future Linda, Isabella sparks an idea and travels back in time. After returning to the present time, Candace leaves in victory, now happy that she had finally (but not technically) busted her brothers. During the credits, it reveals Isabella obtained the tool and gave it to the boys before they even time traveled in the first place. This causes them to change their minds about going into the future, thus, canceling out all the events that happened earlier in the episode and also causing all the characters involved in the future to cease existence (also erasing the [...] "busting" [...] present Candace caused, thus possibly causing a time loop). In [...] "Summer Belongs To You", Phineas mentions time traveling twice and Isabella comments that Phineas has traveled through time [...] "twice", but because of the events in the credits of Quantum Boogaloo, no-one - including Isabella [...] should actually know about the time-traveling.|$|E
2500|$|Billingsley, however, {{questioned}} her character's {{reactions to the}} Cleaver children's misbehavior, basing her concern on personal experience {{as the mother of}} two sons. As the co-producer Joseph Connelly explained, [...] "In scenes where she's mad <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys,</b> she's always coming over to us with the script and objecting. 'I don't see why June is so mad over what Beaver's done. I certainly wouldn't be.' As a result, many of Beaver's crimes have been rewritten into something really heinous like lying about them, in order to give his mother a strong motive for blowing her lady-like stack." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{narrator is}} so taken by his tale that {{he decides to}} risk being late with his {{delivery}} to answer <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> dream. However, when he arrives <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> home ("Jackson Street, 229"), numerous truck drivers — who also have been listening to Teddy Bear's call — are lined up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> home, giving him rides in their trucks. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> thoroughly enjoys his experience.|$|R

6000|$|... "That's {{different}} from Lake Narsac. Don't {{you know this}} place is haunted?" [...] And Peter Peterson looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> very solemnly.|$|E
60|$|The sarcastic {{smile on}} the captain's face told plainly that he rather enjoyed the situation. He gazed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> {{without saying a}} word.|$|E

60|$|The {{schooner}} {{seemed to}} be straying promiscuously through the smother, her head-sail banging wildly. The men waited and looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys,</b> who began fishing.|$|E
6000|$|He gazed inquiringly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> as he ceased speaking, and Harry, {{answering}} for {{the others}} as well as himself, said in a reasonably cheerful tone: ...|$|E
6000|$|The Captain {{smiled as}} he looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys.</b> 'Ay,' he observed, with a flash of his bright dark eyes,' he has the {{advantage}} over Sum.' ...|$|E
60|$|And {{he rushed}} at Tom and aimed a blow <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> {{head with his}} stick.|$|R
60|$|His uncle {{looked down}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> who was wedged in {{between him and}} a stout woman.|$|R
60|$|Gazing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> {{tortured}} face, Felix {{grasped the}} gruesome {{fact that this}} idea amounted to obsession.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if you've got to {{know the}} truth, I'll tell you," [...] growled the man, staring unsteadily <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys.</b> [...] "It's in Miss Harrow's inkwell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Very glad {{indeed to}} see you again,” said Captain Sanders, with a broad smile. He looked closely <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys.</b> “Grown some since I saw you last.” ...|$|E
60|$|Just then, Rectus made a step forward. He {{had been}} looking very anxiously <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> as they got into the boat, but he hadn't said anything.|$|E
60|$|The ticket-seller took <b>the</b> money, looked <b>at</b> it scrutinizingly for an instant, {{and then}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy.</b>|$|R

60|$|And, glaring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang {{in between}} them, with her fist lifted.|$|R
6000|$|... "My, {{but there}} is going to be quite a bunch of us!" [...] was Dave's comment, as he looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> and girls who were present.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll keep as {{straight}} as I can," [...] Master Fernald replied, and then he glanced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys,</b> as if doubtful whether he ought to bid them good-bye.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not unless Sack {{asked me}} to stay. He's queer about that, you know." [...] The old man glanced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys.</b> [...] "Quite a party o' ye, hain't there?" ...|$|E
60|$|Laverick looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy.</b> His {{fingers were}} trembling, {{but it was}} with relief. The note was from Morrison.|$|R
