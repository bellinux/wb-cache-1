A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E
500|$|The minor-key [...] "La Vida es Así" [...] (Life Is Like That) {{features}} vocal {{effects and}} synthesizers. The urban version [...] "attacks" [...] with a modern and aggressive beat; the bachata version is slower, with Luny Tunes' tropical rhythms. In the lyrics, Ivy Queen declares to a rival: [...] "The guy you're dating is mine, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> but here's the detail: He's worthless in bed. That's why I'm here to congratulate you for setting me free, I have to confess". The reggaeton rhymes {{tell a story}} of revenge and lovesickness. Angie Romero of Latina Magazine describes the song as a [...] "powerful and pulsating break-up anthem." ...|$|E
500|$|The Bostonians made a final {{effort to}} slow the proceedings. William Coddington rose, asserting, [...] "I do not see any clear witness against her, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> is a rule of the court that no man may be a judge and an accuser too," [...] ending with, [...] "Here is no law of God that she hath broken nor any law {{of the country that}} she hath broke, and {{therefore}} deserve no censure." [...] The court wanted a sentence but could not proceed until some of the ministers spoke. [...] Three of the ministers were sworn in, and each testified against Hutchinson. [...] Winthrop moved to have her banished; in the ensuing tally, only the Boston deputies voted against conviction. [...] Hutchinson challenged the sentence's legitimacy, saying, [...] "I desire to know wherefore I am banished." [...] Winthrop responded, [...] "The court knows wherefore and is satisfied." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Turn Up the Music" [...] is an uptempo {{electronic}} dance, {{and house}} song, which {{last for a}} duration of three minutes and forty-nine seconds. Instrumentation is provided by pulsating beats, synthesizers and percussion. Rap-Up described the production as [...] "synth-heavy". The song opens with Brown singing [...] "Turn up the music cause the sun just came up / Turn up the music {{if they try to}} turn us down / Turn up the music cause I'm trying to hear the speakers blow / Turn up the music, fill your cup and drink it down". It is then followed by repeated chants of [...] "If you're sexy <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> put your hands up in the air". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard noted that the chanting was a reference to LMFAO's [...] "Sexy and I Know It" [...] (2011). Andy Kellman of Allmusic likened the song to Baltimora's [...] "Tarzan Boy" [...] (1985).|$|E
500|$|... "I wrote a song a {{while back}} even before [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] {{and it was not}} my {{favorite}} song in the world, but I wrote it. Someone asked me to write a song and they told me the story, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was kind of a moving concept or whatever. And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 8, he {{was seriously}} wounded by mortar fire, having just {{returned}} from the canteen bringing chocolate and cigarettes for {{the men at the}} front line. Despite his wounds, Hemingway assisted Italian soldiers to safety, for which he received the Italian Silver Medal of Bravery. Still only 18, Hemingway said of the incident: [...] "When you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality. Other people get killed; not you... Then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> can happen to you." [...] He sustained severe shrapnel wounds to both legs, underwent an immediate operation at a distribution center, and spent five days at a field hospital before he was transferred for recuperation to the Red Cross hospital in Milan. He spent six months at the hospital, where he met and formed a strong friendship with [...] "Chink" [...] Dorman-Smith that lasted for decades and shared a room with future American foreign service officer, ambassador, and author Henry Serrano Villard.|$|E

500|$|... "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] {{marked the}} second {{appearances}} by Adam Scott and Rob Lowe as state auditors sent to solve Pawnee's budget problems. Lowe's Chris Traeger character is energetic, eccentric and overly cheerful, whereas Scott's Ben Wyatt is more pragmatic and realistic. Scott was always intended {{to become a}} regular cast member starting in the third season, while Lowe was originally expected to appear only {{in a few more}} episodes in a guest role. However, after those episodes were filmed, Lowe later joined the show as a regular cast member. Lowe improvised many aspects of his character, including when he handed Ben a water bottle and said, [...] "You should hydrate," [...] and when he clapped after Leslie sang at the concert, [...] "If you're happy <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> clap your hands." [...] Additionally, the episode was the second appearance of Natalie Morales as Lucy, a Pawnee bartender and romantic interest for Tom. [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] also included appearances by recurring guest stars Jama Williamson, who plays Tom Haverford's ex-wife Wendy, and Cooper Thornton, who plays the sarcastic and deadpan Dr. Harris, who tended to Andy's broken arm. Comedian and writer Brian McCann portrayed Freddy Spaghetti himself in the episode. While singing at the concert, McCann improvised a great deal of non-child-friendly dialogue that could not be used in the final episode. Among them were a song about how he pays too much alimony to his wife, and another about meeting all the children's mothers backstage after the show. Guy Stevenson, a MADtv writer and friend of Parks and Recreation cast member Retta, played the man who shouted during a municipal meeting, [...] "With the government shut down, who's going to stop Al-Qaeda?" ...|$|E
500|$|On {{her first}} {{televised}} performance of [...] "White Horse", on November 23, 2008, at the 2008 American Music Awards, Swift donned a white evening gown {{as she sat}} on floral-patterned couch. While promoting the song, she later performed it at the Nomination Concert for the 51st Grammy Awards, where she coupled it in a medley with a cover of Brenda Lee's [...] "I'm Sorry", and the AOL Sessions. Since, Swift has performed the track at the Studio 330 Sessions, the 2009 CMA Music Festival, the 2009 V Festival, and on Dancing with the Stars. Swift performed [...] "White Horse" [...] on all venues in 2009 and 2010 of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour. During the performances, Swift wore a pastel sundress as performed solely playing an acoustic guitar, {{standing at the edge}} of the stage's runway. In the concert on May 22, 2009, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, Swift sang [...] "White Horse" [...] in duet with American singer John Mayer. Reviewing the June 2, 2010 concert at Verizon Center in Washington, D.C., Dave McKenna of The Washington Post reported, [...] "On 'White Horse,' the chorus of believers also joined in, and threw their young fists in the air to yell Swift's esteem-free but cathartic climax, 'I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well!'" [...] Swift said in a 2012 interview with Cosmopolitan that White Horse is in fact her favorite song to sing live, [...] "a song that I've always been proud of because it's about that really horrible feeling of a one-sided relationship that isn't balanced; it's one-sided. You clearly love him more than he loves you, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> And it's a sinking feeling, but it's also a really intoxicating feeling. And a lot of times girls will end up in these relationships where he's not giving you anything so you'll take the crumbs. In my mind what hurts the most is what they didn't say. It's when they knew I needed to hear something and they wouldn't just say it. They knew I needed commitment or loyalty or reassurance, and they wouldn't give it." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Bowdoin with a B.A. in Government and a minor in Asian Studies in 2004, Kondabolu had no {{intention}} of pursuing a stand-up comedy career. He moved to Seattle and took the LSAT preparatory to applying to law school, and worked as an immigrant rights organizer in Seattle for the organization Hate Free Zone (later renamed as OneAmerica) from 2005 to 2007. As part of Hate Free Zone's [...] "Liberty and Justice for All", he led a monthly conversation project focusing on immigration and human rights, saying, [...] "Grassroots organizers know; intimate meetings and real dialogue can cut through the cacophony like nothing else."
