5|$|During her directorship, Cosima opposed {{theatrical}} innovations and adhered {{closely to}} Wagner's original productions of his works, an approach continued by her successors long after her retirement in 1907. She shared Wagner's convictions of German cultural and racial superiority, and under her influence, Bayreuth became increasingly identified with antisemitism. This was {{a defining feature of}} Bayreuth for decades, into the Nazi era which closely followed {{her death in}} 1930. Thus, <b>although</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> widely perceived as the saviour of the festival, her legacy remains controversial.|$|E

5|$|Americans' mistrust and {{dislike of}} lawyers was a {{frequent}} topic of dissection in social problem films such Lawyer Man (1933), State's Attorney, and The Mouthpiece (1932). In films such as Paid (1930), the legal system turns innocent characters into criminals. The life of Joan Crawford's character is ruined and her romantic interest is executed so that she may live free, <b>although</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> innocent of the crime for which the district attorney wants to convict her. Religious hypocrisy was addressed in such films as The Miracle Woman (1931), starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Frank Capra. Stanwyck also portrayed a nurse and initially reluctant heroine who manages to save, via unorthodox means, two young children in danger from nefarious characters (including Clark Gable as a malevolent chauffeur) in Night Nurse (1931).|$|E

Once she is with the Greeks, Diomedes is immediately struck by her beauty. <b>Although</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not hostile, she cannot accept him as her lover. Meanwhile Calchas tells her to accept for herself that the gods have decreed Troy's fall and that she is safer now she is with the Greeks.|$|E

5|$|Her {{most infamous}} antic was giving Ozy a haircut only to accidentally shave off all his fur. <b>Although</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{normally}} manic, {{she also has}} a strong sense of justice, facing the inexplicable wrongs of life and the world she sees. However, her rebellions are mostly limited to annoying her mother, playing jokes on Ozy and disrupting the peace at school. None of which matters any less to her, as long as she has fun doing it. Millie says aloud what others think, and does what others, for fear of reaction from the people around them, would not dare. She, like Ozy, often tries to answer the most important questions in life, but her method of finding the answers makes her unique.|$|E
5|$|Neuner started {{biathlon}} {{when she}} {{was nine years old}} after she had participated in a try out course at her local ski club.

After finishing school, Neuner joined the German Customs Administration in August 2003 to become a member in the government-supported Customs-Ski-Team (Zoll-Ski-Team).

One of her team mates is alpine skiing world champion Maria Höfl-Riesch.|$|E
5|$|After the hijacking, Cofresí adopted Anne as his flagship. <b>Although</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> popularly {{believed}} to have been renamed El Mosquito, all official documents use her formal name. Anne was quickly used to intercept a merchant off the coast of Vieques who was completing a voyage from Saint Croix to Puerto Rico. Like others before it, the fate of the captured ship and its crew is unknown. The Spanish countered with an expedition from the port of Patillas. Captain Sebastian Quevedo commanded a small boat, Esperanza, to find the pirates but was unsuccessful after several days at sea. At the same time, de la Torre pressured the regional military commanders to take action against the pirates and undercover agents monitored maritime traffic in most coastal towns. The pirates docked Anne in Jobos Bay before sunset, a pattern reported by the local militia to southern region commander Tomás de Renovales. At this time the pirates sailed Anne towards Peñuelas, where the ship was recognized. Cofresí's last capture was on March 5, 1825, when he commanded the hijacking of a boat owned by Vicente Antoneti in Salinas.|$|E

5|$|During his investigations, {{the protagonist}} and Rei learn of {{multiple}} demon-run criminal organizations causing chaos in Hirasaki including factions of the Yakuza, {{all of them}} connected to Davis. The protagonist's efforts against the demon threats are hindered by Hideo Momochi, who accuses the pair {{of being involved in}} the incidents until the police station is infested by demons and the police chief is revealed to be a demon in disguise. The protagonist also foils an attempt to Kumiko for unknown reasons. After taking down each of the five major demon factions, Davis reveals that the entire affair was orchestrated to break five seals holding prisoner the spirit of Inaruna: once a powerful regional priestess who was executed for resisting the forces of Emperor Jimmu with her magical powers during the unification of Japan, her spirit's hatred for her conquerors has grown beyond control and she will destroy the city if released. Kumiko, the reincarnation of Inaruna, is successfully abducted by Davis and used as a host for Inaruna's spirit. <b>Although</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> summoned, the protagonist and Rei rescue Kumiko and kill Davis. They then successfully defeat Inaruna. With the city returned to normal, the protagonist remains trapped in Kuzunoha's body, and can choose either to use his own name or adopt the Kuzunoha title.|$|E
5|$|Sutherland {{travels to}} Como {{to rest and}} recover from illness, indulging in free {{religious}} speculation while there.

Sutherland retires to a monastery, although his repentance is short lived, and he dies still in doubt. Helen, meanwhile, separates from her husband and retires to a convent, <b>although</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> unreconciled with the Church because she maintains that her love for Sutherland is holier than her marriage.|$|E
