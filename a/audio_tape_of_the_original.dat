40|$|No {{two people}} {{perceive}} {{the world around}} them in exactly the same way. Each of us first filters thesights, sounds and sensations surrounding us through our sensory systems before sending these perceptions on to be processed by and stored in our brains. Understanding exactly how we make sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world around us caught <b>the</b> interest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> psychologist, Richard Bandler and the linguist, John Grinder in the 1970 ’s. Working together at <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> California at Santa Cruz, Bandler and Grinder began to study excellence in communication in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> psychotherapy. Based on the premise that modeling successful people and defining exactly what they do can lead to successful communica-tion, Grinder and Bandler made video and <b>audio</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> renowned therapists, Virginia Satir (family therapy), Fritz Perls (Gestalt therapy), and Milton Erickson (hypnotherapy).

40|$|Examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{relationship}} <b>of</b> musicianship and educatorship {{of teacher}} and students as interacting partners in a specific musical context proceeded with investigation of how formal, informal, impressionistic, and supervisory musical and educational knowledge were evidenced in rehearsal. Attention was also given to how <b>the</b> teaching strategies <b>of</b> modeling, coaching, scaffolding, fading, articulating, reflecting comparatively, and exploring were used to develop student musicianship. The research methodology may {{best be described as}} an inductive analytical case study approach. Multiple data sources included: videotaped observations of 19 bi-weekly rehearsals, <b>audio</b> <b>taped</b> interviews <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 12 participants, supplemental materials, (a published interview, journal articles, rehearsal schedules), and member checking with the teacher and David Elliott. Rehearsal data were initially organized into categories identified in David J. Elliott's (1995) model. <b>The</b> relationship <b>of</b> teacher and student musicianship, and teacher educatorship emerged during analysis. Musical details of problem finding, reducing and solving were also identified. Three themes emerged from the student interviews: their perceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teacher's musicianship, general rehearsal strategies, and <b>the</b> teacher's use <b>of</b> specific teaching strategies. Interviews with the teacher illuminated his perception of musicianship and teaching strategies employed in the context. The findings confirmed that as music making transpired in the rehearsals, <b>the</b> kinds <b>of</b> knowing present in <b>the</b> musicianship <b>of</b> {{teacher and students}} and the teacher's educatorship were not only intertwined but were utilized at the same time. <b>The</b> level <b>of</b> student musicianship was allied to <b>the</b> relationship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teacher's musicianship and educatorship.

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{disease is}} a major global challenge. However, chronic illness and its care, when intruding into {{everyday}} life, has received less attention in Asia Pacific countries, including Australia, who are in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> transitioning to chronic disease orientated health systems. Aim The study aims to examine experiences of chronic illness before and after <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> Australian Medicare incentives for longer consultations and structured health assessments in general practice. Methods Self-help groups around <b>the</b> conditions <b>of</b> diabetes, epilepsy, asthma and cancer identified key informants to participate in 4 disease specific focus groups. <b>Audio</b> <b>taped</b> transcripts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> focus groups were coded using grounded theory methodology. Key themes and lesser themes identified using a process <b>of</b> saturation until <b>the</b> study questions on needs and experiences of care were addressed. Thematic comparisons were made across the 2002 / 3 and 1992 / 3 focus groups. Findings At times of chronic illness, there was need to find and then ensure access to 'the right GP'. The 'right GP or specialist' committed to an in-depth relationship of trust, personal rapport and understanding together with clinical and therapeutic competence. The 'right GP', the main specialist, the community nurse and the pharmacist were key providers, whose success depended on interprofessional communication. The need to trust and rely on care providers was balanced by the need for self-efficacy 'to {{be in control of}} disease and treatment' and 'to be your own case manager'. Changes in Medicare appeared to have little penetration into everyday perceptions of chronic illness burden or time and quality of GP care. Inequity of health system support for different disease groupings emerged. Diabetes, asthma and certain cancers, like breast cancer, had greater support, despite common experiences of disease burden, and a need for research and support programs. Conclusion Core themes around chronic illness experience and care needs remained consistent over the 10 year period. Reforms did not appear to alleviate <b>the</b> burden <b>of</b> chronic illness across disease groups, yet some were more privileged than others. Thus in the future, chronic care reforms should build from greater understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> people with chronic illness. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the social}} work literature, class issues have been {{described}} within <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> persons who are currently poor and or poor working class. However, this literature is silent on class issues relating to <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> poverty. This was particularly evident with regard to women {{who grew up in}} poor, working class homes and chose social work as a profession, which was my research interest. This descriptive phenomenological study using a feminist epistemology explores <b>the</b> lived experience <b>of</b> five social workers who grew up in poor, working class homes. Descriptive information was generated through face to face <b>audio</b> <b>taped</b> interviews. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> women held either a Masters or Bachelor of Social Work degree and worked and lived in northern British Columbia. From <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> descriptive data, six significant themes were identified: women social workers from poor, working class backgrounds learned how to fit into the middle class by being very good observers of behaviour; they felt a sense of alienation from family and friends because of their current class position; conversely, they still did not feel that they belonged to the middle class; they did not quite believe that they deserved what they have accomplished; they felt that they have had to work extra hard to achieve their current status; and they recognized at least one person as a significant role model who influenced their lives. This study did not generalize to all social workers who grew up in poor, working class backgrounds. However, it did give voice to <b>the</b> experiences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> women in this study and may resonate for other women who have shared <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> crossing class borders.

In this study I examined <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> collaboration, curriculum, and the classroom context in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> pedagogical content knowledge of a mathematics teaching intern. Additionally, I investigated <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collaborative process between the teaching intern and his mentor teacher as they collaborated on action (during structured planning time) and in action (while students were present). The teaching internship resided in a seventh-grade mathematics classroom during <b>the</b> teaching <b>of</b> a probability unit from a standards-based curriculum, Connected Mathematics Project. Using existing research, a conceptual framework was developed and multiple data sources (<b>audio</b> <b>taped</b> collaborations, observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intern's teaching practices, semi-structured interviews, and a mathematics pedagogy assessment) were analyzed {{in order to understand the}} teaching intern's development of knowledge of instructional strategies, knowledge of student understandings, curricular knowledge, and conceptions of purpose for teaching probability. Results identified numerous dilemmas related to planning and implementing instruction. Although the teaching intern developed pedagogical content knowledge, he often experienced difficulty accessing it while teaching. Through collaboration, curriculum, and the classroom context, the teaching intern learned to incorporate his pedagogical content knowledge in instruction. Analysis revealed that as he gained new knowledge he was able to shift his focus from content to <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> instructional strategies for teaching and learning. The curriculum was <b>the</b> primary focus <b>of</b> collaboration and initiated <b>the</b> intern's examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> learning-to-teach process. Collaboration on action and collaboration in action proved to be essential elements in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> pedagogical content knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Work {{is being}} done at three {{universities}} to help today's NASA engineers use the knowledge and experience of their Apolloera predecessors in designing liquid rocket engines. Ground-breaking work {{is being done}} in important subject areas to create a prototype <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important functions for the Rocket Engine Numerical Simulator (RENS). <b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> RENS is to develop an interactive, realtime application that engineers can utilize for comprehensive preliminary propulsion system design functions. RENS will employ computer science and artificial intelligence research in knowledge acquisition, computer code parallelization and objectification, expert system architecture design, and object-oriented programming. In 1995, a 3 year grant from the NASA Lewis Research Center was awarded to Dr. Douglas Moreman and Dr. John Dyer of Southern University at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to begin acquiring knowledge in liquid rocket propulsion systems. Resources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> West Florida in Pensacola were enlisted to begin <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> enlisting knowledge from senior NASA engineers who are recognized experts in liquid rocket engine propulsion systems. Dr. John Coffey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> West Florida is utilizing his expertise in interviewing and concept mapping techniques to encode, classify, and integrate information obtained through personal interviews. The expertise extracted from the NASA engineers has been put into concept maps with supporting textual, audio, graphic, and video material. A fundamental concept map was delivered by <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first year <b>of</b> work and <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> maps containing increasing amounts of information is continuing. Find out more information about this work at <b>the</b> Southern University/University <b>of</b> West Florida. In 1996, <b>the</b> Southern University/University <b>of</b> West Florida team conducted a 4 day group interview with a panel of five experts to discuss failures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RL 10 rocket engine {{in conjunction with the}} Centaur launch vehicle. The discussion was recorded on video and <b>audio</b> <b>tape.</b> Transcriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire proceedings and an abbreviated video presentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discussion highlights are under development. Also in 1996, two additional 3 year grants were awarded to conduct parallel efforts that would complement the work being done by Southern University and <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> West Florida. Dr. Prem Bhalla of Jackson State University in Jackson, Mississippi, is developing the architectural framework for RENS. By employing the Rose Rational language and Booch Object Oriented Programming (OOP) technology, Dr. Bhalla is developing <b>the</b> basic structure <b>of</b> RENS by identifying and encoding propulsion system components, their individual characteristics, and cross-functionality and dependencies. Dr. Ruknet Cezzar of Hampton University, located in Hampton, Virginia, began working on the parallelization and objectification of rocket engine analysis and design codes. Dr. Cezzar will use the Turbo C++ OOP language to translate important liquid rocket engine computer codes from FORTRAN and permit their inclusion into the RENS framework being developed at Jackson State University. <b>The</b> Southern University/University <b>of</b> West Florida grant was extended by 1 year to coordinate <b>the</b> conclusion <b>of</b> all three efforts in 1999...|$|R
