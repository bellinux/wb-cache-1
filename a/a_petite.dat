25|$|Buggy Races – Buggy, officially called Sweepstakes, is a race around Schenley Park. It can {{be thought}} of as a relay race with five runners, using the buggy vehicle as the baton. Entrants submit a small, usually torpedo-shaped, vehicle that is pushed uphill and then allowed to roll downhill. The {{vehicles}} are unpowered, including the prohibition of such energy-storing devices as flywheels. They are, however, steered by a driver who is usually <b>a</b> <b>petite</b> female student lying prone, arms stretched forward to steer via a turning mechanism. Space is so tight inside the buggies that the drivers usually cannot change position beyond turning their heads.|$|E
500|$|Her parents' {{relationship}} was quarrelsome; Marguerite Louise took every chance to humiliate Cosimo. On one documented occasion, she branded him [...] "a poor groom" [...] {{in the presence}} of the Papal nuncio. The enmity between them continued until 26 December 1674; after all attempts at conciliation failed, a stressed Cosimo consented to his wife's departure for the Convent of Montmartre, France. The contract created that day revoked her privileges as <b>a</b> <b>petite</b> fille de France, and declared that upon her death all her assets were to be inherited by her children. Cosimo granted her a pension of 80,000 livres in compensation. She abandoned Tuscany in June 1675; Anna Maria Luisa never saw her again. Although Cosimo doted on his daughter, she was raised by her paternal grandmother, Vittoria della Rovere.|$|E

Prior to Jones' casting, Alice Eve was the subject of what Variety called [...] "widespread Internet reports" [...] that Eve [...] "was set to play Emma Frost, although no deal was in place." [...] Jones accepted the role to get something different from her job in the TV series Mad Men. While discovering that like the show First Class was set in the 1960s, the actress considered that: [...] "'s so, so far from Betty and from Mad Men, and it takes place in that time but it doesn’t feel like a period movie." [...] The actress described the revealing costumes of the character as [...] "insane," [...] saying, [...] "She's got quite the bod, which is very intimidating". The actress stated that she did only a limited exercise routine to keep in shape, as [...] "I'm <b>a</b> <b>petite</b> person, so I didn't want to go into a strict workout and eating regime." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{weeks with}} two major armies sitting within miles {{of each other}} were not without conflict, and <b>a</b> <b>petite</b> guerre ensued in the no man's land between White Marsh and Northern Liberties. Minor skirmishes between light troops {{increased}} in intensity throughout November, with almost daily losses being incurred by both the British and the Americans. In retaliation, on November 22, Howe ordered his troops to set fire to several large country houses in the Germantown area, including Fair Hill, a mansion and country estate that had previously belonged to John Dickinson. [...] Eleven houses in all were burned to the ground, and residents of Philadelphia climbed onto rooftops and church steeples to watch the spectacle. [...] Just one day earlier, crowds had gathered to watch the burning of Commodore John Hazelwood's Pennsylvania Navy in the Delaware. [...] On the same morning the mansions were burned, an earthquake struck Philadelphia, and was felt {{as far away as}} Lancaster. [...] On November 27, an aurora borealis lit up the night skies. [...] The two events caused quite a stir among both the residents of Philadelphia and the troops, British and American alike, who took them as an ominous sign of things to come.|$|E

Roger sets him up {{on a date with}} Bethany, a friend of his wife Jane, who is <b>a</b> <b>petite</b> blonde, like Betty. After the date, Bethany (Anna Camp) expresses interest in seeing Don again, but rejects his sexual advances. On Thanksgiving Day, Don spends time with a prostitute, and Betty has problems fitting in with the family of her new husband Henry (Christopher Stanley). At Thanksgiving dinner with his family, Betty's daughter Sally (Kiernan Shipka) complains about the food. The childish action blows up into a scene when Betty yells at Sally, treats her brusquely, and causes problems by forcing food into Sally's [...] mouth. Henry's mother later privately expresses displeasure with her son's new wife, observing that her children are clearly scared of her. However, in bed, Henry and Betty get along. The next day, Don picks up his two oldest children for an overnight visit, and Don is disappointed he can't see baby Gene, whom Betty sent to Carla's. Betty curtly tells Don to have the kids back by 9. When he returns the next evening, the house is empty and he has to wait for Betty and Henry to come back. When they return, at 10:30 pm, an argument ensues about the house; Don, at his lawyer's instigation, angrily reminds them {{they were supposed to be}} out a month ago, and he demands they either buy him out, pay him rent, or leave. [...] A minor argument later sparks between Henry and Betty when Henry agrees with Don's point. [...] Betty stubbornly reiterates that they will leave on her timeline, not Don's.|$|E

She consumes progressively more wine during each meeting with Chauvin, at times [...] "mechanically", and in Chapter 7, she drinks too much wine and winds up vomiting out the wine she had been drinking that day. In the final, 8th chapter, she then drinks the wine [...] "in small mouthfuls" [...] (« <b>à</b> <b>petites</b> gorgées»).|$|R

2500|$|As a {{performance}} artist he enjoyed creating the costumes, and often shocking audiences. He first {{appeared at the}} Anthony D'Offay Gallery in London in 1988. In a signature performance, he would appear on stage in outlandish drag or other costume, looking very huge. He would sing and dance about. Then suddenly, much to the audience's surprise, he would drop onto his back and simulate giving birth to <b>a</b> <b>petite</b> and naked young woman, who was his friend and assistant Nicola Bateman. She had been hidden {{for the first part}} of the performance by being strapped to Leigh's belly with her face in his crotch. Then she would slip out of her harness, and appear to pop out of Bowery's belly along with a lot of stage blood and links of sausages, while Bowery wailed. [...] Bowery would then bite off the umbilical cord and the two would take a bow. Boy George said he saw it a number of times, and that it [...] "never ceased to impress or revolt".|$|E
2500|$|The {{length of}} ladies' evening gloves are {{referred}} to in terms of [...] "buttons", whether they in fact have buttons or not. The word is derived from French, and the exact measure is actually a bit longer than one inch. Wrist length gloves are usually eight-button, those at the elbow are 16, mid-biceps are 22 and full shoulder length are 30. Opera gloves are between 16 and 22inches long, though some gloves can be as long as 29 or 30inches. To fit oneself for gloves, measure all around the hand at the widest part of the palm where the knuckles are, but excluding the thumb. The measurement in inches is the glove size, but if one's arms are large, it may be practical to go up a size. Generally, an evening glove {{is considered to be}} a true [...] "opera-length" [...] glove if it reaches to mid-biceps or higher on the wearer's arm, notwithstanding its actual length in inches or buttons; therefore, <b>a</b> <b>petite</b> woman might find a glove with a measurement of 16 or 17inches adequate for the purpose, while a tall woman might need a glove longer than 22inches. A glove shorter than elbow-length should not be referred to as an [...] "opera-length glove" [...] or [...] "opera glove" [...] under any circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|The 5th Avenue Theatre's 2012 production, {{directed}} by Peter Rothstein, included African-American dancers and an African-American actor as Jud. The choice was intended, {{as in the}} Arena Stage production, to reflect the historical presence of African Americans in the Oklahoma territory, but it [...] "has some audience members squirming in their seats ... they're seeing on stage one of the ugliest stereotypes in our history: an imposing black man ravaging <b>a</b> <b>petite</b> white woman [...] the white hero ... all but urges Jud to hang himself – and even pantomimes the act. Some see a clear reference to lynching." [...] The [...] "Dream Ballet" [...] had a sinister, sexual tone and ended with Jud dragging Laurey away to be raped. One critic noted the historical [...] "license taken when an African-American farmhand is allowed to escort a white woman to the box dance. ... Maybe some people ... left with {{not so much a}} song in their head, but a question in their heart. And isn't that part of what theater is supposed to do?" [...] Another wrote: [...] "Rothstein's Oklahoma! is now the story of a crazy, sex obsessed black man ... lusting violently after his white mistress, who ends up murdered {{at the hands of a}} white man, who gets off scot free after a mock trial." ...|$|E
