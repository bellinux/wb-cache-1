5|$|In 1976, Shulgin was {{introduced}} to MDMA by {{a student in the}} medicinal chemistry group he advised at San Francisco State University. MDMA had been synthesized in 1912 by Merck and patented in 1912 as an intermediate of another synthesis in order to block competitors, but was never explored in its own right. Shulgin went on to develop a new synthesis method, and in 1976, introduced the chemical to Leo Zeff, a psychologist from Oakland, California. Zeff used the substance in his practice in small doses as an aid to talk therapy. Zeff introduced the substance to hundreds of psychologists and lay therapists <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation,</b> including Ann (born Laura Ann Gotlieb), whom Alexander Shulgin met in 1979, and married in 1981. It was her fourth marriage, and she had had four children.|$|E
5|$|Route markers {{were first}} {{introduced}} in Australia in late 1954. Over the following decades they were progressively rolled {{out to the}} various highways <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation,</b> under a nationwide route numbering scheme. The highway originally carried the National Route 23 route marker. Although after {{the construction of the}} Eastern Parkway extension, the highway north of Canberra Avenue was signed with the Alternate National Route 23 route marker. The section of the Monaro Highway between Steeple Flat and Cooma was also signed the National Route 18 shield in addition to the National Route 23 route marker used along the remainder of its length; this arrangement is known as a duplex or concurrency. This allowed one route to cover the Snowy Mountains Highway from end to end, as the Monaro Highway forms a link between that highway's two sections.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, one of Independence Hall's {{exterior}} doors {{was replaced by}} glass, allowing some view of the bell even when the building was closed. When Congress enacted the nation's first peacetime draft in 1940, the first Philadelphians required to serve took their oaths of enlistment before the Liberty Bell. Once the war started, the bell was again a symbol, used to sell war bonds. In {{the early days of}} World War II, it was feared that the bell might be in danger from saboteurs or enemy bombing, and city officials considered moving the bell to Fort Knox, to be stored with the nation's gold reserves. The idea provoked a storm of protest from <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation,</b> and was abandoned. Officials then considered building an underground steel vault above which it would be displayed, and into which it could be lowered if necessary. The project was dropped when studies found that the digging might undermine the foundations of Independence Hall. The bell was again tapped on D-Day, as well as in victory on V-E Day and V-J Day.|$|E

5|$|Occurring {{just two}} months after Cyclone Paula {{affected}} Vanuatu, Sose compounded the damage already done by the previous storm, especially to crops and farmlands. Throughout the island chain, two people lost their lives to the storm. Roadways were blocked by debris and floodwaters, while schools and classrooms on several islands were damaged or ruined. The storm destroyed about 200 homes <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> and damaged many more, particularly on southern Espiritu Santo. The storm's large fetch generated enormous swells {{as far away as}} Australia's Eastern Seaboard, where surfers took advantage of the abnormally intense conditions and two swimmers drowned. On Maré Island in New Caledonia, a man was swept away by a large wave and presumed dead. The storm later produced torrential rainfall and strong winds over the North Island of New Zealand, sparking damaging freshwater floods and downing trees and power lines. Hazardous driving conditions in the Waikato region led to a fatal traffic accident in which three people died. Another individual drowned in a swollen river. Sose reportedly contributed to coastal flooding as far away as Tonga. In all, Sose killed nine people; total monetary damage is unknown. As a result of the storm's destruction, its name was later retired.|$|E
5|$|Route markers {{were first}} {{introduced}} in Australia in late 1954. Over the following decades they were progressively rolled {{out to the}} various highways <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation,</b> under a nationwide route numbering scheme. Previous to the NSW conversion to alphanumeric routes in 2013, the highway was signed as National Route 18 shield along its entire length. In addition to this, {{the section of the}} Monaro Highway between Cooma and Steeple Flat was also signed the National Route 18 shield in addition to the National Route 23 route marker used along the remainder of its length within NSW; this kind of arrangement is known as a duplex or concurrency. This allowed one route to cover the highway from end to end. The Snowy Mountains Highway was allocated the alphanumeric route B72 as part of New South Wales' 2013 conversion. The route duplex along the Monaro Highway remains intact with B72 used in addition to B23 between Cooma and Steeple Flat.|$|E
