50|$|Social media also {{alters the}} way we {{understand}} each other. Social media has allowed for mass cultural exchange and intercultural communication. For example, people from different regions or even different countries can discuss current issues on Facebook. <b>As</b> <b>different</b> <b>cultures</b> have <b>different</b> value systems, cultural themes, grammar, and worldviews, they also communicate differently. The emergence of social media platforms collided <b>different</b> <b>cultures</b> and their communication methods together, forcing them to realign in order to communicate with ease with other <b>cultures.</b> <b>As</b> <b>different</b> <b>cultures</b> continue to connect through social media platforms, thinking patterns, expression styles and cultural content that influence cultural values are chipped away.|$|R

25|$|When the Spanish {{arrived in}} western Nicaragua {{in the early}} 16th century, they found three {{principal}} tribes, each with <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>culture</b> and language: the Niquirano, the Chorotegano, and the Chontal. Each one of these diverse groups occupied much of Nicaragua territory, with independent chieftains who ruled according to each group's laws and customs. Their weapons consisted of swords, lances, and arrows made out of wood. Monarchy was the form of government of most tribes; the supreme ruler was the chief, or cacique, who, surrounded by his princes, formed the nobility. Laws and regulations were disseminated by royal messengers who visited each township and assembled the inhabitants to give their chief's orders.|$|E

Wales became, effectively, part of England, even though its people spoke a different language and had <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>culture.</b> English kings appointed a Council of Wales, sometimes presided over by {{the heir to the}} throne. This Council normally sat in Ludlow, now in England but at that time still part of the disputed border area in the Welsh Marches. Welsh literature, particularly poetry, continued to flourish, however, with the lesser nobility now taking over from the princes as the patrons of the poets. Many consider Dafydd ap Gwilym, who flourished {{in the middle of the}} 14th century, the greatest of the Welsh poets.|$|E

Lawrence removed Bandit's clownish origins, stressing that Bandit could not understand English, nor reliably save the family from perilous situations. Summarizing the group's behavior, Lawrence wrote, [...] "Jonny's response to danger will be close to Race's.

[...] "Films were my only opening to the world," [...] Téchiné explained in an interview. [...] "They were my only possibility of escaping my family environment and my boarding school. It was probably dangerous because, through movies, I learned how the world works and how human relations work. But it was magical, and I was determined to follow the thread of that magic." ...|$|E

60|$|As was the {{necessity}} of British opposition to American independence, so was {{the necessity}} of Northern opposition to Southern secession. I do not say that in other respects the two cases were parallel. The States separated from us because they would not endure taxation without representation--in other words, because they were old enough and big enough to go alone. The South is seceding from the North because the two are not homogeneous. They have different instincts, different appetites, different morals, and <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>culture.</b> It is well for one man to say that slavery has caused the separation, and for another to say that slavery has not caused it. Each in so saying speaks the truth. Slavery has caused it, seeing that slavery is the great point on which the two have agreed to differ. But slavery has not caused it, seeing that other points of difference {{are to be found}} in every circumstance and feature of the two people. The North and the South must ever be dissimilar. In the North labor will always be honorable, and because honorable, successful. In the South labor has ever been servile--at least in some sense--and therefore dishonorable; and because dishonorable, has not, to itself, been successful. In the South, I say, labor ever has been dishonorable; and I am driven to confess that I have not hitherto seen a sign of any change in the Creator's fiat on this matter. That labor will be honorable all the world over as years advance and the millennium draws nigh, I for one never doubt.|$|E
