5|$|The ancient Penny Hedge {{ceremony}} is {{performed on the}} eve of Ascension Day commemorating a penance imposed by the abbot on miscreant hunters in the Middle Ages. The hunters using a knife costing a penny had to cut wood in Eskdaleside <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Whitby harbour where it was made into a hedge that would survive three tides. This tradition is carried out annually {{on the east side of}} the upper harbour.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the Society of Leopold excavates {{the site}} of Vyšehrad Castle; they recover Christof's body <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> London, where he is awoken by a female voice. He learns that the events at Vyšehrad and the {{resulting}} human uprising divided the vampires into two sects: the Camarilla who seek to hide from humanity and the Sabbat who seek to regain dominion over it. The Society's excavation also enables Vukodlak's followers to recover Vyšehrad. After escaping, Christof meets Pink, who agrees to help him. They learn that the Setite clan has been shipping Vyšehrad contraband to New York City and infiltrate a Setite brothel to gain information. They kill the Setite leader Lucretia and recruit Lily, an enslaved prostitute.|$|E
5|$|In chapter 17 of Skáldskaparmál, the jötunn Hrungnir is {{in a rage}} and, while {{attempting}} to catch up and attack Odin on his steed Sleipnir, ends up at the doors to Valhalla. There, the Æsir invite him in for a drink. Hrungnir goes in, demands a drink, and becomes drunk and belligerent, stating that he will remove Valhalla <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{the land of the}} jötunn, Jötunheimr, among various other things. Eventually, the gods tire of his boasting and invoke Thor, who arrives. Hrungnir states that Thor is under their protection, and subsequently he can't be harmed while in Valhalla. After an exchange of words, Hrungnir challenges Thor to a duel at the location of Griotunagardar, resulting in Hrungnir's death.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{back at the}} ranch, Mephesto and his {{assistant}} Kevin have created a human clone of Stan for Terrance. The boys attempt to get the pig and the elephant drunk and to mate, {{but it does not}} seem to be working until Chef stops by and sings to the animals with a little help from Elton John. The cloned Stan breaks free from Mephesto's ranch and proceeds to terrorize the town. The boys eventually find the clone <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Stan's house and convince it to attack Shelley; however, it decides to destroy the house and indirectly kills Kenny, by flinging him into a microwave, with a chair. Mephesto shows up and shoots the clone, but Stan is afraid he will be in trouble for everything the clone did. However, in a brief moment of kindness, Shelley takes the blame, after which she beats up Stan.|$|E
5|$|Notions {{associated}} with the zduhać, vetrovnjak, and dragon man, respectively, are not identical. The dragon man fought against female demons called ala, which led hail clouds over fields to destroy crops, and consumed the fertility of the fields. The zduhaći (plural) of an area usually fought together against the attacking zduhaći of another area who were bringing a storm and hail clouds above their fields. The victorious zduhaći would loot the yield of all agricultural produce from the territory of their defeated foes, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> their own region. The vetrovnjak, recorded in parts of western Serbia, fought against a bringer of bad weather imagined as a black bird. The zduhaći are recorded in Montenegro, eastern Herzegovina, part of Bosnia, and the Sandžak region of south-western Serbia. The dragon men are recorded in eastern Serbia, Banat, western Bulgaria, and Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 20thcentury, the Serbian badnjak {{tradition}} {{has also been}} celebrated more publicly. Before World War I, soldiers of the Kingdom of Serbia developed the custom of laying a badnjak on a fire in their barracks. In the succeeding Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the military badnjak ceremony was further elaborated and standardized in army service regulations, but the tradition ended at the outbreak of World War II. Since the early 1990s, the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve in which the badnjak plays a central role. Parishioners festively cut the sapling {{to be used as}} the badnjak <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> their church, where it is consecrated by a priest before it is ceremonially placed on a fire built in the churchyard.|$|E

25|$|A {{wholesale}} electricity market exists when competing generators {{offer their}} electricity output to retailers. The retailers then re-price the electricity <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> market. While wholesale pricing {{used to be}} the exclusive domain of large retail suppliers, increasingly markets like New England are beginning to open up to end-users. Large end-users seeking to cut out unnecessary overhead in their energy costs are beginning to recognize the advantages inherent in such a purchasing move. Consumers buying electricity directly from generators is a relatively recent phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|On the {{appointed}} day, one must {{remove all the}} relevant produce, and all products containing such produce, from his home <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a public area such as a sidewalk. Once there, the individual declares the produce in front of three {{people who do not}} live with him. He then waits to give the witnesses a chance to claim the produce. Once they have taken what they want, he is permitted to reclaim whatever remains. It is permissible to choose three people whom one knows will not claim the produce for themselves, even though they are legally entitled to.|$|E

50|$|A change {{came about}} 1740 when fustian masters gave out raw cotton and warps to the weavers and {{returned}} to collect the finished cloth. The weaver organised the carding, spinning and weaving to the master's specification. The master then dyed or printed the grey cloth, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> shopkeepers. Ten years later this had changed and the fustian masters were middle men, who collected the grey cloth <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> market in Manchester where <b>it</b> was sold <b>to</b> merchants who organised the finishing.|$|R
25|$|When the Great Chicago Fire {{broke out}} on October 8, 1871, news of this, {{one of the}} worst conflagrations in U.S. history to ever strike an American city, reached company {{officials}} Henry Willing and Levi Leiter, who decided to load as much of their expensive merchandise as possible onto wagons <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Leiter’s home, which was out of the path of the fire. The Company’s drivers and teams were ordered out of the barns. Horace B. Parker, a young salesman, rushed to the store’s basement, broke up boxes, and built a fire in the furnace boiler so that the steam-powered elevators could be operated. These employees worked feverishly through the night to remove vital records and valuable goods to safety.|$|E
25|$|Public waste {{containers}} or street bins {{are provided}} by local authorities {{to be used as}} a convenient place for the disposal and collection of litter. Increasingly both general waste and recycling options are provided. Local councils pick the waste up <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> reuse or recycling. However, there are issues with this approach. If the bins are not regularly emptied, then overfilling of bins occurs and can increase litter indirectly. Some local authorities will only take responsibility for rubbish that is placed in the bins, which means that litter remains a problem. People may blame a lack of well-placed bins for their littering. Hazardous materials may be incorrectly disposed of in the bins and they can encourage dumpster diving.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} secure storage {{stretches}} {{far back in}} time. The earliest known locks {{were made by the}} Egyptians. Ancient Romans used a more sophisticated locking system, called warded locks. Warded locks had special notches and grooves that made picking them more difficult. Lock technology advanced independently in ancient India, Russia, and China, where the combination lock is thought to have originated. In the United States, most banks relied on small iron safes fitted with a key lock up until {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century. After the Gold Rush of 1849, unsuccessful prospectors turned to robbing banks. The prospectors would often break into the bank using a pickax and hammer. The safe was usually small enough that the thief could get it out a window, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a secluded spot to break it open.|$|E

25|$|The temple complex also {{contains}} a model of Angkor Wat (the most sacred of all Cambodian shrines). In 1860, King Mongkut ordered his generals to lead 2,000 men to dismantle Angkor Wat <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Bangkok. Modern scholars suggested that the king wanted to show that Siam was still in control of Cambodia, as France was seeking to colonise Cambodia at that time. However, the king's order could not be fulfilled. A royal chronicle written by , then foreign minister, recorded that many Thai men fell ill after entering Cambodian wilderness. The chronicle also stated that forest-dwelling Khmer people ambushed the Thai army, killing many leading generals. King Mongkut then ordered {{the construction of the}} model within Wat Phra Kaew, instead of the real Angkor Wat that could not be brought to Bangkok. Mongkut died before he could see the model. Its construction was completed in the reign of his son, Chulalongkorn.|$|E
25|$|Dental {{avulsion}} {{is a real}} dental {{emergency in}} which prompt management (within 20–40 minutes of injury) affects the prognosis of the tooth. The avulsed permanent tooth should be gently but well rinsed with saline, with care taken not to damage {{the surface of the}} root which may have living periodontal fiber and cells. Once the tooth and mouth are clean an attempt can be made to re-plant in its original socket within the alveolar bone and later splinted by a dentist for several weeks. Failure to re-plant the avulsed tooth within the first 40 minutes after the injury may result in a less favorable prognosis for the tooth. If the tooth cannot be immediately replaced in its socket, follow the directions for Treatment of knocked-out (avulsed) teeth and cold milk or saliva <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> an emergency room or a dentist. If the mouth is sore or injured, cleansing of the wound may be necessary, along with stitches, local anesthesia, and an update of tetanus immunization if the mouth was contaminated with soil. Management of injured primary teeth differs from management of permanent teeth; avulsed primary tooth should not be re-planted (to avoid damage to the permanent dental crypt).|$|E

500|$|Rita Dhody and Narendra Kumar {{were chosen}} to style the film's characters. Dhody said it took nearly two months for UTV and Bhandarkar to persuade her to help design the film; she found the job {{challenging}} because {{she had to make}} everything as authentic as possible. Chopra had to wear 137 costumes in the film because her character passed through five phases. Initially, she was a [...] "hep" [...] character with brightly coloured, matching attire. Her make-up becomes lighter as she becomes a model and later a supermodel. When her career falters, Chopra's look becomes softer, demonstrating her character's lack of concern about her appearance before she returns to Mumbai. According to Dhody, Chopra's look is [...] "very contemporary and a very much today's look, but my idea was to streamline <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the classic side [...] than making it trend-based".|$|E

In the mid-1980s, Nelson, Jennings, Kristofferson, and Johnny Cash formed The Highwaymen, who achieved platinum record sales and toured the world. Meanwhile, he became more involved with charity work, such as singing on We are the World in 1984. In 1985, Nelson had another success with Half Nelson, a compilation album of duets {{with a range of}} artists such as Ray Charles and Neil Young. In 1980, Nelson performed on the south lawn of the White House. The concert of September 13 featured First Lady Rosalynn Carter and Nelson in a duet of Ray Wylie Hubbard's [...] "Up Against the Wall Redneck Mother". Nelson frequently visited the White House, where according to the biography by Joe Nick Patoski, Willie Nelson: An Epic Life, he smoked marijuana on the White House roof.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after hiring Kosinski, Bailey {{approached}} screenwriting duo Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, {{who accepted}} for being self-described [...] "obsessed about Tron". Horowitz later claimed {{the challenge was}} to [...] "homage the first movie, continue the story, expand it <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> another place and open up space for new fans", and Kitsis claimed that the film would start a whole new mythology [...] "of which we're only scratching the surface". Horowitz and Kitsis first created a story outline, and developed and fine-tuned the plot with Bailey and Kosinski across {{a period of two}} days in La Quinta. The writers also consulted Lisberger, to view Trons creator input on the story. Lisberger gave his blessing, particularly as he has a son the same age as Sam, which Kitsis stated that [...] "was like we had tapped into something he was feeling without even realizing it." [...] The Pixar team contributed with rewrites for additional shooting after being shown a rough cut in March 2010, which helped in particular to the development of Sam's story line.|$|E
