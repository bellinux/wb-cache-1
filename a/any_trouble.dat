He is extremely loyal to the Beast so as to save himself and anyone else <b>any</b> <b>trouble,</b> often leading to friction between himself and Lumière. Will Finn served as the supervising animator for Cogsworth. Stiers also narrates the prologue.|$|E
5|$|The {{build-up}} to {{the final}} had focused upon many Manchester United fans' discontent at their takeover by American businessman and sports tycoon Malcolm Glazer, and large demonstrations were planned {{inside and outside the}} Millennium Stadium. Despite this, the final was played in the rain and only a small group of around 100 supporters held protests and sang anti-Glazer songs. The police were out in force but did not have <b>any</b> <b>trouble</b> to deal with.|$|E
5|$|The series {{differs from}} the {{original}} comics in that Valerian comes from the year 2417, instead of 2720, and meets Laureline in the year 912 instead of 1000. Whereas in the comics Valerian takes Laureline back to the 28th century without <b>any</b> <b>trouble,</b> in the animated series this results in Earth disappearing from the solar system.|$|E

5|$|Ms. Mililani Minerva Mudd, Millie's mother, is a lawyer, who is as an older, wiser, more {{temperate}} {{version of}} Millie. She was like Millie in her childhood, {{and as a}} result knows how to deal with <b>any</b> <b>trouble</b> caused by her, much to Millie's annoyance. While Ms. Mudd knows how to deal with Millie, she is also the first to lend her support if there is anything amiss. She married Llewellyn {{at the end of the}} strip's run in a storyarc from November–December 2008. Her full name was revealed on October 1, 2008.|$|E
5|$|To get to {{the high}} profile Esterbrook, Peter makes a deal with Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), who tells him where to find Claire before she {{can be turned into}} a {{radioactive}} bomb. The FBI storms the building, and Olivia is able to give Claire the cure before her head explodes. Estebrook arrogantly tells Olivia his lawyers will spring him out of <b>any</b> <b>trouble,</b> and she publicly arrests him to ensure the press finds out, causing his company's stock to dramatically decrease in value. After Broyles lectures her, Olivia tells him her emotions (which she had exhibited strongly all episode) make her a better agent.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1905, Tomita and Maeda gave several public {{demonstration}}s of judo. On February 17, 1905, Tomita and Maeda gave a demonstration at Princeton University, when Maeda threw N. B. Tooker, a Princeton football player, while Tomita threw Samuel Feagles, the Princeton gymnasium instructor. On February 21, 1905, they gave a judo demonstration at the United States Military Academy at West Point, where Tomita and Maeda performed kata (patterns)—nage-no, koshiki, ju-no, and so on. At {{the request of}} the crowd, Maeda wrestled a cadet and threw him easily. Because Tomita had been the thrower in the kata, the cadets wanted to wrestle him too. Tomita threw the first (Charles Daly) without <b>any</b> <b>trouble.</b> However, Tomita twice failed to throw another football player named Tipton using tomoe-nage (stomach throw). Afterwards, the New York sportswriters claimed the victory for the cadets because Tomita was thrown, whereas the Japanese embassy staff proclaimed that Tomita had achieved a moral victory, on the grounds that he was a far smaller man.|$|E

5|$|Fixtures between Millwall and West Ham United are {{currently}} categorised by the Metropolitan Police as category C– games which carry {{a high risk}} of disorder amongst supporters. For the 2011–12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations to ensure that the games passed by without any incident. In 2013 a member of West Ham's hooligan Inter City Firm was jailed for 12 months for organising violence between West Ham and Millwall fans during an FA Cup match between Dagenham & Redbridge and Millwall on 7 January 2012. He chose this game in the belief fewer police would be in attendance at a match in Dagenham, but who instead, turned out in force to prevent trouble. In November 2014 the two sides' development squads were drawn against each other in the U21 Premier League Cup. The Metropolitan Police took preventative measures against <b>any</b> <b>trouble</b> occurring, demanding the game at Rush Green kick-off at 12pm and be played behind closed doors.|$|E
5|$|Yuan Hsieh (d. +1220) was Director-General of {{governmental}} grain stores. In pursuance of his schemes for {{the relief of}} famines he issued orders that each pao (village) should prepare a map which would show the fields and mountains, the rivers and the roads in fullest detail. The maps of all the pao were joined {{together to make a}} map of the tu (larger district), and these in turn were joined with others to make a map of the hsiang and the hsien (still larger districts). If there was <b>any</b> <b>trouble</b> about the collection of taxes or the distribution of grain, or if the question of chasing robbers and bandits arose, the provincial officials could readily carry out their duties by the aid of the maps.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{who live}} {{outside of the}} Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander into the forest to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats <b>any</b> <b>trouble,</b> and so are free to wander outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It {{is not unusual for}} a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have to prove themselves in order to be regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E

Multiple handlers are preferred, as the mare and stallion can be easily separated should there be <b>any</b> <b>trouble.</b>|$|E

25|$|The main {{weapons in}} Graf's game were her {{powerful}} inside-out forehand drive (which earned her the moniker Fräulein Forehand) and her intricate footwork.

25|$|After {{the end of}} the 1980s, the FARC has widely {{adopted as}} its most {{reliable}} weapon the soviet made AK-47 assault rifle. The AK-47 rifle is famous worldwide as employed by members of the Vietnamese guerrillas, when they were fighting the Army of the Republic of Vietnam and the United States Army. According to many guerrillas, the AK-47 is easy to use, as sometimes it can be hidden in water or mud, and after a cleaning it usually works without <b>any</b> <b>trouble</b> (such as ammunition jamming).|$|E

25|$|A planned opening date of 1 April 1966 {{had to be}} {{abandoned}} when the station's vessel, Oceaan 7, shed its radio mast. However, the station finally opened in June, broadcasting on 1115 kilohertz, 269 metres, in the medium wave. This wavelength was used by some existing radio stations in southern and eastern Europe but these were too far away for Radio 270 to cause them <b>any</b> <b>trouble.</b> However, the frequency was close to Radio London on 1133kHz, resulting in the potential for mutual interference on radios with less precise tuning.|$|E
25|$|The Workers Party {{has fallen}} {{heir to the}} present radical {{political}} situation in the United States. Is it built to represent the American worker? So far the radical movement has represented the European worker in the United States. The opportunities for a radical political party are as great as, or greater than, ever before; the important problem before the Workers Party is to get radical ideas before the workers. Its second and more serious problem is to establish proper relations with Moscow. Moscow is strong; the Workers Party is weak; Moscow can dominate without <b>any</b> <b>trouble.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1851, the Wingfield {{brothers}} settled and claimed the land near the cabin built by Woods. The Wingfields did not initially experience <b>any</b> <b>trouble</b> with the Native population. On April 20, 1852, Mariposa County was subdivided, creating Tulare County, with the temporary county seat to be near the Woods cabin. Creating a new county brought new government positions, and during the preparation for elections {{to be held in}} July 1852, the Wingfield brothers were taken captive by Native Americans. They were later released when an armed expedition under Major James Savage approached the encampment.|$|E
