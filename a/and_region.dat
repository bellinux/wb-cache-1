Today, {{may be more}} than ever, {{there is a need for}} competitiveness of cities <b>and</b> <b>regions,</b> <b>and</b> this cannot be achieved without taking into account the global dimension of the environmental problems. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the issue of promoting renewable energy, as a possible local solution to global environmental problems of competitive cities <b>and</b> <b>regions.</b> First, some global environmental problems and success factors of competitive cities <b>and</b> <b>regions</b> are revealed, <b>and</b> second, some measures and actions for promoting renewable energy in Romania's development regions are suggested. The findings of this study reveal that renewable energy plays a major role among the success factors of competitive cities <b>and</b> <b>regions,</b> which may be encouraged to become sustainable, green cities <b>and</b> <b>regions.</b> In addition, the study has revealed that there is a need for a strong partnership between the local stakeholders in order to develop competitive green cities, and also for actions or programs that may promote and/or support the use of renewable energy for the development of cities <b>and</b> <b>regions</b> in Romania. The results of this study may be used for upcoming research in the area of implementing renewable energy projects for the development of competitive cities <b>and</b> <b>regions</b> in a world of globalization...|$|R
