40|$|NASA's Satellite Laser Ranging Network was {{originally}} {{developed during the}} 1970 s to track satellites carrying corner cube reflectors. Today eight NASA systems, achieving millimeter ranging precision, {{are part of a}} global network of more than 40 stations that track 17 international satellites. To meet the tracking demands of a steadily growing satellite constellation within existing resources, NASA is embarking on a major automation program. While manpower on the current systems will be reduced to a single operator, the fully automated SLR 2000 system is being designed to operate for months without human intervention. Because SLR 2000 must be eyesafe and operate in daylight, tracking is often performed in a low probability of detection and high noise environment. The goal is to automatically select the satellite, setup the tracking and ranging hardware, verify acquisition, and close the tracking loop to optimize data yield. To accomplish the <b>autotracking</b> tasks, we are investigating (1) improved satellite force models, (2) more frequent updates of orbital ephemerides, (3) lunar laser ranging data processing techniques to distinguish satellite returns from noise, and (4) angular detection and search techniques to acquire the satellite.
