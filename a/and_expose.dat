5|$|Fowles's {{presentation}} of Sarah, {{one of the}} most enigmatic female characters in literary history, is also psychoanalytically informed. Fowles himself was interested in the psychology of men and women.The enigma of femininity, myth of masculinity, and impossibility of man-woman relationship are some of the crucial themes. Through Sarah's deliberate spreading of lies about herself and her relationship with Charles, Fowles brilliantly brings about the various aspects of femininity that has the potential to authenticate, threaten, <b>and</b> <b>expose</b> the vanity of the male subjects.|$|E

5|$|Dragon Quest {{was created}} by Yuji Horii, who took {{inspiration}} from previous role-playing games such as Wizardry, Ultima, and his own 1983 title The Portopia Serial Murder Case. Horii wanted to create an RPG which would appeal to a wide audience {{of people who were}} unfamiliar with the genre of video games in general. He tried to place a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement, as well as simplify the interface <b>and</b> <b>expose</b> the mostly Western computer genre to the Japanese console market. Manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama produced the game's artwork and Koichi Sugiyama composed its music. The North American version featured numerous changes, including battery-backed RAM save games (rather than using a password save system), modified character sprites and pseudo-Elizabethan English style dialog.|$|E

5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{are found}} in the 5' UTR of messenger RNA, upstream of a protein-coding gene. Here they are able to occlude the ribosome binding site (RBS) and prevent translation of the mRNA into protein. As temperature increases, the hairpin structure can 'melt' <b>and</b> <b>expose</b> the RBS or Shine-Dalgarno sequence to permit binding of the small ribosomal subunit (30S), which then assembles other translation machinery. The start codon, typically found 8 nucleotides downstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, signals the beginning of a protein-coding gene which is then translated to a peptide product by the ribosome. In addition to this cis-acting mechanism, a lone example of a trans-acting RNA thermometer has been found in RpoS mRNA where it is thought {{to be involved in the}} starvation response.|$|E

40|$|A testing {{protocol}} was established {{for measuring the}} flexure properties of thin-walled tubes constructed of a composite mixture of glass and carbon fibers and epoxy resin for use in Fly Fishing rods. Standard three point bend tests were conducted in accordance with ASTM standard D 7329 - 13 with a span length of six inches. All samples were of the sample length and diameter, allowing direct comparison of the maximum loads reached before failure, which are directly indicative of the Modulus of Rupture (MOR). Two constructions were tested both containing the same unidirectional fiber but with different support structure. These tubes were tested identically for both as delivered samples and for the samples having undergone ultraviolet, humidity, and elevated temperature exposure. Construction 1 reached higher maximum stresses than Construction 2 and displayed similar amounts of flexure. When coated <b>and</b> <b>exposed,</b> the strength of Construction 1 and 2 both increased when compared to uncoated and unexposed samples. In Construction 1, maximum loads achieved in samples painted, clear coated <b>and</b> <b>exposed</b> averaged loads at failure of 45. 33 lb, solely clear coated <b>and</b> <b>exposed</b> samples averaged 42. 9 lb at failure, uncoated <b>and</b> <b>exposed</b> averaged 38. 1 lb, and uncoated and unexposed averaged 40. 9 lb. In Construction 2, the differences were less pronounced. Painted, clear coated, <b>and</b> <b>exposed</b> averaged 39. 6 lb at failure, clear coated <b>and</b> <b>exposed</b> averaged 38. 0 lb, uncoated <b>and</b> <b>exposed</b> averaged 36. 2 lb, and uncoated, unexposed averaged 36. 6 lb.

5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{displays}} are seen, with aggressive behaviours outnumbering pro-social ones. Crouching low and uttering quiet begging calls are common signs of submission. The manus flutter is a submissive display where a magpie will flutter its primary feathers in its wings. A magpie, particularly a juvenile, may also fall, roll over on its back <b>and</b> <b>expose</b> its underparts. Birds may fluff up their flank feathers as an aggressive display or preceding an attack. Young birds display various forms of play behaviour, either by themselves or in groups, with older birds often initiating the proceedings with juveniles. These may involve picking up, manipulating or tugging at various objects such as sticks, rocks or bits of wire, and handing them to other birds. A bird may pick up a feather or leaf and flying off with it, with other birds pursuing and attempting {{to bring down the}} leader by latching onto its tail feathers. Birds may jump on each other and even engage in mock fighting. Play may even take place with other species such as blue-faced honeyeaters and Australasian pipits.|$|E
5|$|As the Nameless officially do not exist, {{the upper}} echelons of the Gallian Army exploit {{the concept of}} {{plausible}} deniability in order to send them on missions that would otherwise make Gallia lose face in the war.

5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots <b>and</b> <b>expose</b> them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{occupational}} exposure {{is the main}} cause of lead poisoning. People can be exposed when working in facilities that produce a variety of lead-containing products; these include radiation shields, ammunition, certain surgical equipment, developing dental x-ray films prior to digital x-rays (each film packet had a lead liner to prevent the radiation from going through), fetal monitors, plumbing, circuit boards, jet engines, and ceramic glazes. In addition, lead miners and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range instructors, and plastic manufacturers are at risk for lead exposure. Other occupations that present lead exposure risks include welding, manufacture of rubber, printing, zinc and copper smelting, processing of ore, combustion of solid waste, and production of paints and pigments. Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home on clothes or skin <b>and</b> <b>expose</b> their children. Occupational exposure to lead increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular: stroke, and high blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|The Grenade, Hand, Anti-Tank No. 74, {{commonly}} known as the S.T. Grenade or sticky bomb, was a British hand grenade designed and produced during the Second World War. The grenade was {{one of a number of}} anti-tank weapons developed for use by the British Army and Home Guard as an ad hoc solution to a lack of sufficient anti-tank guns in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation. Designed by a team from MIR(c) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae, the grenade consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives (this added stability to the mix, as well as giving it its squash-head-like effect) covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet-metal casing. When the user pulled a pin on the handle of the grenade, the casing would fall away <b>and</b> <b>expose</b> the sticky sphere. Pulling another pin would arm the firing mechanism and the user would then attempt to attach the grenade to an enemy tank or other vehicle. Letting go of the handle would release a lever that would activate a five-second fuse, which would then detonate the nitroglycerin.|$|E

FAST successfully obtains cost CUI in a cost-efficient way, thus can know exactly what are the neighborhood doing currently. FAST includes Attachment Coding in PHY layer to provide cost-effective CUI, and Attachment Sense in MAC layer to utilize CUI to identify hidden <b>and</b> <b>exposed</b> nodes in real time.

5|$|Two {{weeks after}} the end of the hostage crisis, President Claire Haas (Marcia Cross) and CIA {{director}} Matthew Keyes put forth a covert joint task force between the FBI and CIA. President Haas mentions that there were eight collaborators within the shadowy cabal group who are secretly involved with the AIC. As a result of Lydia's actions, the collaborators gained access to sensitive U.S intelligence. This information was vital to their goal of controlling certain areas within the government. As a response, the task force is assigned to uncover the conspiracy <b>and</b> <b>expose</b> the involvement of the collaborators in orchestrating the hostage crisis. Alex is hired to be a member of the task force along with Ryan Booth, Nimah Amin, Shelby Wyatt, and Dayana Mampasi.

5|$|The battle {{began at}} about 9am on 14 October and lasted all day, but while a broad outline is known, the exact events are {{obscured}} by contradictory accounts in the sources. Although {{the numbers on}} each side were about equal, William had both cavalry and infantry, including many archers, while Harold had only foot soldiers and few, if any, archers. The English soldiers formed up as a shield wall along the ridge and were at first so effective that William's army was thrown back with heavy casualties. Some of William's Breton troops panicked and fled, {{and some of the}} English troops appear to have pursued the fleeing Bretons until they themselves were attacked and destroyed by Norman cavalry. During the Bretons' flight, rumours swept through the Norman forces that the duke had been killed, but William succeeded in rallying his troops. Two further Norman retreats were feigned, to once again draw the English into pursuit <b>and</b> <b>expose</b> them to repeated attacks by the Norman cavalry. The available sources are more confused about events in the afternoon, but it appears that the decisive event was Harold's death, about which differing stories are told. William of Jumièges claimed that Harold was killed by the duke. The Bayeux Tapestry has been claimed to show Harold's death by an arrow to the eye, but that may be a later reworking of the tapestry to conform to 12th-century stories in which Harold was slain by an arrow wound to the head.|$|E
