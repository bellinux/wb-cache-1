5|$|The Tempest first <b>appeared</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> in 1905. Charles Urban filmed {{the opening}} storm {{sequence}} of Herbert Beerbohm Tree's version at Her Majesty's Theatre for a -minute flicker, whose individual frames were hand-tinted, {{long before the}} invention of colour film. In 1908, Percy Stowe directed a Tempest running a little over ten minutes, which is now {{a part of the}} British Film Institute's compilation Silent Shakespeare. Much of its action takes place on Prospero's island before the storm which opens Shakespeare's play. At least two other silent versions, one from 1911 by Edwin Thanhouser, are known to have existed, but have been lost. The plot was adapted for the Western Yellow Sky, directed by William A. Wellman, in 1946.|$|E
25|$|The tour courted many {{controversial}} {{subjects such}} as violence, firearms, human rights, nudity, and politics; in one part, the face of French far right politician Marine Le Pen <b>appeared</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> with a swastika on her forehead. Le Pen then threatened to sue the singer. Other parts included the singer attacking dancers with fake guns as blood spattered in the background as well as mooning and briefly exposing her breasts to the audience. Despite the controversies, The MDNA Tour received positive reviews and became the highest-grossing tour of 2012 and the tenth highest-grossing tour of all time, grossing $305.1 million in ticket sales from 88 sold-out shows, watched by an audience of 2.21million. The Miami shows on November 19–20, 2012, were recorded and released as Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour.|$|E

The most significant among them is her reconciliation with Dylan, {{who was going to}} move in with her. It is assumed that they were together for most episodes of the seventh and eighth seasons of the series, as during an episode of season 8 where it is learned that Dylan's half-sister was saved from a life of prostitution and then left to live with Dylan and Brenda in London and Kelly and Brandon mentioned going to visit them for part of their honeymoon. Later, when Dylan returned in season 9, he told his friends that he and Brenda had separated two years earlier. However, it frees Dylan to resume his relationship with Kelly.|$|E

500|$|To promote [...] "Oh Mother" [...] and Back to Basics, Aguilera {{performed}} the song {{on a number}} of occasions.

The 40-minute concert comprised songs from the then-upcoming Back to Basics and other songs, including [...] "Lady Marmalade" [...] (2001) and [...] "Beautiful" [...] (2002). MTV UK was positive toward the performance, wrote, [...] "The gig reflected the jazz club mood of Christina's new album, with a swinging brass-heavy backing band and fit dancers bounding sexily around the stage". Later, [...] "Oh Mother" [...] was also performed during her worldwide Back to Basics Tour (200607).

500|$|On September 9, 1939, Selznick, his wife, Irene, {{investor}} John [...] "Jock" [...] Whitney {{and film}} editor Hal Kern {{drove out to}} Riverside, California to preview it at the Fox Theatre. The film was still a rough cut at this stage, missing completed titles and lacking special optical effects. It ran for four hours and twenty-five minutes, but would later be cut down to under four hours for its proper release. A double bill of Hawaiian Nights and Beau Geste was playing, and after the first feature {{it was announced that}} the theater would be screening a preview; the audience were informed they could leave but would not be readmitted once the film had begun, nor would phone calls be allowed once the theater had been sealed. When the title <b>appeared</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> the audience cheered, and after it had finished it received a standing ovation. In his biography of Selznick, David Thomson wrote that the audience's response before the film had even started [...] "was the greatest moment of [...] life, the greatest victory and redemption of all his failings", with Selznick describing the preview cards as [...] "probably the most amazing any picture has ever had." [...] When Selznick was asked by the press in early September how he felt about the film, he said: [...] "At noon I think it's divine, at midnight I think it's lousy. Sometimes I think it's the greatest picture ever made. But if it's only a great picture, I'll still be satisfied." ...|$|E

This {{was the first time}} Cher <b>appeared</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> since Stuck on You (2003). Talking about the making of the film, Cher revealed, [...] "It’s harder to do things. I've beat my body up so badly, it's amazing it's still talking to me and listening to what I say. But I’ve got aches and pains everywhere." [...] The soundtrack was also revealed, with eight songs performed by Aguilera, and two songs by Cher: [...] "Welcome to Burlesque" [...] and [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me". During an interview with a California journal, Cher commented about [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me", [...] "That song, for me, had a lot of meaning. It reminded me that I have to kind of move over." [...] She also spoke about the track with the Fresno Bee, saying [...] "Not that I'm doing it gracefully, because you'd have to pull me over kicking and screaming." [...] In the United States, the song was released to adult contemporary radio station on January 15, 2011 the first single from the soundtrack. In order to promote the song, several promotional remixes were made by Almighty, Dave Aude and StoneBridge. The remix EP, which contains uptempo dance versions of the track, was released onto iTunes Stores on November 24, 2010. The remix done by StoneBridge was released as a single on December 7, 2010. The song is also included in Cher's 25th studio album, Closer to the Truth (deluxe edition).|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} later added as a video {{interlude}} on The MDNA Tour in 2012, {{as a tribute}} to Tyler Clementi and other teens who had committed suicide due to bullying. The film, which was created by Swedish director Johan Söderberg, morphed Madonna's face with a number of famous figures, including then-Chinese President Hu Jintao, US Republican former presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Pope Benedict XVI. The face of French far right politician Marine Le Pen <b>appeared</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> with a swastika superimposed on her forehead, before it morphed into the face of Adolf Hitler. Le Pen was infuriated by the video, and threatened to sue Madonna should this happen during her concert in France on July 14, 2012, also known as Bastille Day, the French National Day. Socialist French government spokesperson Najat Vallaud-Belkacem had also expressed her disappointment. However, Madonna kept the video unchanged on this date, prompting Le Pen to file a lawsuit against her. A spokesman for Le Pen said a lawsuit for [...] "public insult" [...] would be lodged with the Paris courts in the next few days. Madonna responded to the lawsuit saying [...] "I know that I made a certain Marine Le Pen very angry with me. And it's not my intention to make enemies." [...] She later explained in an interview with Brazilian network Rede Globo, that the sequence was about [...] "intolerance that we human beings have for one another. And how much we judge people before knowing them. That's why it's done in the song 'Nobody Knows Me.'" [...] During her concert in Nice, France, the swastika was removed and was replaced by an interrogation mark.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, [...] "Girl" [...] {{was part}} of the set list of the group's final tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It. The {{performance}} was preceded by a video interlude, during which Beyoncé, Williams and Rowland <b>appeared</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> on the stage. The former two started discussing about the latter's relationship who also joined them after hearing their opinions. Their discussions were similar to the lyrical content of the song with the two trying to convince her the relationship is wrong and the latter defending her love interest. After the interlude finished, the group appeared onstage performing [...] "Girl" [...] mixing it with [...] "I'll Take You There". While reviewing a concert in the UK, Adenike Adenitire of MTV News praised the performance, concluding [...] "They borrowed the 'Sex and the City' theme for the 'Girl' video, but they lean more toward 'Girlfriends' when taking it on the road, with a light comedy moment that may see TV execs thinking seriously about a Destiny's Child sitcom." [...] In contrast, Barbara Ellen of The Observer criticized the segment during which [...] "Girl" [...] was performed, writing [...] "... no amount of 'girlpower' rabble-rousing can disguise the fact the songs are wet-paper-bag weak; giving the impression of three bored young women dozing off at a slumber party, whining in their jim-jams about men who 'done them wrong', or men who 'done someone else wrong', or just men doing wrong, period." [...] The song was included on the track listing of the group's live album Destiny's Child: Live in Atlanta (2006) chronicling a concert from the tour in that city.|$|E

On January 29, 2017 at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, Orton won the Royal Rumble {{for the second time in}} his career by lastly eliminating Roman Reigns. Despite this, on the February 14 episode of SmackDown, Orton came out after Wyatt won his triple-threat rematch against John Cena and AJ Styles and relinquished his shot at the WWE Championship, basically giving his full devotion to Wyatt and leaving the main event of WrestleMania in the air. On the February 28 episode of SmackDown, however, Orton turned on Wyatt while Wyatt was delivering his promo as he <b>appeared</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> being seen inside Wyatt' compound, where he claimed that despite being Wyatt's home, it wasn't his, and declared his intentions to burn the soul of [...] "Sister Abigail" [...] and set the entire compound on fire after stating that he would face Wyatt at WrestleMania, turning Orton into a fan favorite again. On the March 7 episode of SmackDown, Orton faced AJ Styles to become the number one contender for the WWE Championship, which Orton won. On April 2 at WrestleMania 33, Orton defeated Wyatt to win the WWE Championship for the ninth time, his first WWE Championship win at WrestleMania and also his 13th overall World Championship. On the following SmackDown, Wyatt challenged Orton to a [...] "House of Horrors" [...] rematch, but after Wyatt was moved to the Raw brand as a result of the Superstar Shake-up, it was made a non-title match and scheduled for Raw's pay-per-view Payback on April 30.|$|E
