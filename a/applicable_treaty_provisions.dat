40|$|This {{paper is}} a chapter for a {{forthcoming}} book, the Oxford Guide to Treaties. The chapter addresses {{the application of}} treaties within domestic legal systems. Traditional scholarship on the domestic application of treaties {{has focused on the}} distinction between monist and dualist legal systems. Although the monist-dualist framework helps illuminate important formal differences among states, the chapter suggests that scholarly preoccupation with the formal distinction between monism and dualism tends to obscure key functional differences among states. After discussing the monist-dualist dichotomy in Part One, the remainder of the chapter adopts a functional approach, focusing primarily on the role of domestic courts in promoting compliance with treaty obligations and protecting treaty-based private rights. Part Two explains the distinction between horizontal, vertical and transnational <b>treaty</b> <b>provisions.</b> Part Three addresses the functional distinction between nationalist and transnationalist approaches to judicial application of treaties. Part Four discusses the crucial role of domestic courts in promoting compliance with treaty obligations, especially transnational and vertical treaty obligations. The analysis shows that domestic courts {{play a key role in}} protecting private rights under transnational <b>treaty</b> <b>provisions</b> and promoting compliance with those provisions, but they play virtually no role in promoting compliance with horizontal <b>treaty</b> <b>provisions.</b> This is generally true for both monist and dualist states. The story with respect to vertical <b>treaty</b> <b>provisions</b> is more complicated. When domestic courts adopt a transnationalist approach, they play a key role in protecting private rights under vertical <b>treaty</b> <b>provisions</b> and promoting compliance with those provisions. When domestic courts adopt a nationalist approach, vertical <b>treaty</b> <b>provisions</b> may be under-enforced. There does not appear to be any significant correlation between a state’s formal classification as monist or dualist and the tendency of domestic courts in that state to function in a nationalist or transnationalist mode...|$|R

40|$|One {{shortcoming}} {{of much of}} {{the historical}} institutionalist literature is its alleged lack of testable propositions and the elusive notion of 'unintended consequences' of initial institutional choices. This article, which offers an historical institutionalist explanation of institutional creation and operation, aims to overcome these shortcomings. We develop a set of propositions and demonstrate their plausibility by exploring the creation of the European Community's budgetary treaty in 1970 and the operation of the enacted <b>treaty</b> <b>provisions.</b> We demonstrate that, under specific conditions, actors may be doomed to opt for 'dysfunctional' institutions at the moment of their creation. Furthermore, we show that the notion of 'unintended consequences' does not necessarily help us to understand the reason for the contestation of <b>treaty</b> <b>provisions.</b> Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze the direct effect of <b>Treaty</b> <b>provisions,</b> {{starting}} from {{the moment when the}} doctrine of direct effect of Community law was created by ECJ up to the present time. To this end, the first objective is to define the concept of “direct effect”, by revealing the broad and the narrow sense of the notion, and the relation between two different notions: direct effect and direct applicability. Following to the definition of the concept, the next objective is to point out the importance of analysing the matter – both as a major difference from international treaties, and {{as one of the most}} important characteristics which define the relation between European law (with focus to the Treaties) and domestic law. In this context, the main objective of the paper is to present the evolution of the notion and conditions under which <b>Treaty</b> <b>provisions</b> can achieve direct effect, as they derive from European ECJ’ decisions, starting from vertical effect (negative obligations, positive obligations, incomplete implementation of principles stipulated by Treaties, as a result of non-taking of appropriate measures at Community level), to horizontal effect, and finally to the indirect effect (duty of consistent interpretation, requiring all national legislation to be interpreted in the light of the EC law by national courts). At the same time, in close relation to the presentation of ECJ’ decisions, the paper also intends to present the main academic debates on the same issues (evolution of the notion and conditions for achieving direct effect), consequent to creation and evolution of the doctrine of “direct effect”. As a final objective, the paper will summarize the meaning of the notion of “direct effect” and the actual conditions required for incidence in the case of <b>Treaty</b> <b>provisions,</b> and also the practical implications of the expansion direct effect of <b>Treaty</b> <b>provisions,</b> both socially, and financially...|$|R

500|$|In 1886, another dispute arose over {{fishing rights}} with the United States. Americans {{fishermen}} {{had been using}} <b>treaty</b> <b>provisions</b> allowing them to land in Canada to take on wood and water as a cover for clandestine inshore fishing. Several vessels were detained in Canadian ports, to the outrage of Americans, who demanded their release. Macdonald sought to pass a Fisheries Act which would override some of the <b>treaty</b> <b>provisions,</b> {{to the dismay of}} the British, who were still responsible for external relations. The British government instructed the Governor General, Lord Lansdowne, to reserve Royal Assent for the bill, effectively placing it on hold without vetoing it. [...] After considerable discussion, the British government allowed Royal Assent at the end of 1886, and indicated it would send a warship to protect the fisheries if no agreement was reached with the Americans.|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{tendency}} of investment tribunals to resort to teleological interpretation and to the protection and promotion of foreign investments as a standard goal of investment treaties. It further explores how this tendency relates {{to the rule of}} interpretation envisaged in Articles 31 – 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties considering that the convention rule requires that text, context, and purpose are to be equally assessed when searching for the meaning of a <b>treaty</b> <b>provision.</b> The article’s particular focus is on whether investment tribunals have begun to create specific rules for interpreting investment treaties that favor one of the elements of interpretation over the others, namely, the purpose of the treaty. This method of teleological interpretation is set against the general background of investment arbitration, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and cases where investment tribunals’ reliance on the preamble of the <b>applicable</b> <b>treaty</b> was decisive for the final outcome of the case. These cases, which revolved around the goal to protect and promote foreign investments and teleological interpretation, lend support to the proposition {{that there has been a}} departure from the general rule. However, they equally show the unreliability of telos in a treaty: purposes may be different, even conflicting, and their clear meaning can easily escape interpreters. Despite a growing number of cases where the purpose of a treaty comes to the forefront of legal reasoning, the functional correlation between the purpose of a treaty and the legitimacy of a claim still remains unclear...|$|R
