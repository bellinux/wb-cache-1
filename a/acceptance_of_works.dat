5000|$|In his {{compressed}} dialogue structure too, he {{was ahead}} of his time. And much-later writers like David Mamet, Harold Pinter, and Samuel Beckett (also an admirer) paved {{the way to the}} <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> in this [...] "distilled" [...] style which has now become {{the sine qua non of}} the modern audience with its very different attention span. His early stories from the 1940s and 1930s were, because of their brevity, not even considered short stories at all at the time. They were vehemently rejected time after time by the mainstream magazines, causing him almost to give up the notion of ever becoming a writer. Now this brevity of conveying a fullness and richness of experience in what Dame Edith called a [...] "marrow of form" [...] has almost become a necessary standard. Both his [...] "distilled" [...] style and his reliance on dialogue to tell his story eluded the normal contemporary reader of his early days. There was an ingrained custom towards a much longer, more expository experience. His roots were in drama. It is a little-known fact that Purdy started writing plays as a child, crafting them to win his elder brother's approval. Purdy would act all the characters in the plays, and play them out using stick-figures, which is consistent with the early origins of Federico Garcia Lorca.|$|E

40|$|The lack of {{standardised}} {{guidelines for}} the preparation and submission <b>of</b> <b>work</b> schedule has contributed to several problems in construction project especially the extra efforts {{that have to be}} put in before parties involved in the project accept the work plan. This paper explores the current practice in project scheduling in the Malaysian construction industry and proposes guidelines that will alleviate the current problems in project scheduling. The methodology adopted was through interviews and questionnaire survey. The findings of the survey form a basis for the formulation of the guidelines. It consists of four main aspects of project scheduling which are process <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> schedule, responsibilities <b>of</b> the contracting parties, application <b>of</b> <b>work</b> schedule, and implications <b>of</b> <b>work</b> schedule. With the establishment of these guidelines a standardised approach for the preparation and submission <b>of</b> <b>work</b> schedule can be achieved thus will be able to minimise {{some of the problems that}} are currently hinder the full application of project scheduling in various construction projects. The proposed guidelines will pave the way for the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>work</b> schedule as part of the contract document...|$|R

Thomson was intrigued but initially skeptical. Over the next two years, Thomson became increasingly convinced of Joule's theory, finally admitting his conviction in print in 1851, simultaneously crediting von Mayer. Thomson collaborated with Joule, mainly by correspondence, Joule conducting experiments, Thomson analysing the results and suggesting further experiments. The collaboration lasted from 1852 to 1856.
