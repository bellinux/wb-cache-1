30|$|In {{a patient}} {{less than half}} of a volume increase, tidal or PEEP {{inflation}} is directed towards the diaphragmatic area and thereby affecting the abdomen.

This rise is dependent {{on the size of the}} upper surface area of the abdomen. In the model, all volume increase is directed towards the “diaphragm” and the abdominal container as it was not possible to build a separate chest wall and diaphragm. To compensate for this, the diaphragmatic surface area was made 1500  cm 2, twice the size in an adult person.

With new inexpensive printed memory, {{it will be}} possible to manufacture cheap surveillance tags that are capable to tell the user if something has happened within a timeline. This project is within the ITC FrameProgram 7 founded project PriMeBits. The goal is to imple‐ment a write once read many memory (WORM) onto an RF‐tag together with a sensor that can sense wetness, which can be detected by EAS antitheft systems. Pre researches have been done in the fields printed capacitance, coils and WORMs, all printed with silver ink. Before implementation of a WORM onto a tag simulations and laboratory tests with <b>adjustable</b> <b>resistances</b> were made. Two different circuit models are simulated and tested. When connected to a tag and the WORM is un‐programmed, the EAS system should not trigger an alarm. But if the WORM is programmed by the sensor, the alarm should trigger. Results show that capacitances and WORMs are printable with this technique but coils are not due to high inner resistance. The simulations show that a tag built as an LCCR‐circuit is the best choice. This is also confirmed with tests done with real resistors. With WORMs connected to a tag the results show that approximately 70 % of them work as intended, this is because the WORMs as of now are not completely developed. The conclusion of this project is that it is possible to implement a WORM onto a tag with further research, to make an inexpensive surveillance tag. PriMeBit...|$|R
40|$|Right {{ventricular}} (RV) afterload {{is a key}} {{determinant of}} RV function and is increased in many cardiopulmonary pathologies. Pulmonary circulation input impedance {{has been used to}} quantify afterload previously but due to its complexity has not been widely applied. This study examines the effect of a subset of the impedance spectrum, the zeroth and first harmonic impedance moduli (Z (0), Z (1)), on RV performance in large animals. An artificial circuit with <b>adjustable</b> <b>resistance</b> and compliance (C) was implanted into the pulmonary circulation of five sheep. Resistance was varied to increase Z (0) in increments of 2 mmHg/(L/min) until Z (0) was 8 mmHg/(L/min) above baseline. At each Z (0), C was adjusted between 0, 0. 5 and 2 mL/mmHg or 0, 1, and 5 mL/mmHg. Fourier transforms of the pulmonary artery pressure and flow in each situation were used to calculate the pulmonary impedance. Results show that the percent change in cardiac output (%DeltaCO) is linearly related to the change in Z (0) (DeltaZ (0)). Increases in Z (1) (DeltaZ (1)) decreased %DeltaCO but to a much smaller degree, with the effect of DeltaZ (1) increasing with DeltaZ (0). Regression of these results produce the equation: %DeltaCO = (- 0. 0829 DeltaZ (1) - 3. 65) DeltaZ (0) - 9. 02 (R (2) = 0. 69). Blood flow and pressure moduli are small at harmonics higher than the first and are unlikely to affect RV function.

40|$|Magnetic {{resonant}} coupling (MRC) is {{an efficient}} method for realizing the near-field {{wireless power transfer}} (WPT). Although the MRC enabled WPT (MRC-WPT) with {{a single pair of}} transmitter and receiver has been thoroughly studied in the literature, there is limited work on the general setup with multiple transmitters and/or receivers. In this paper, we consider a point-to-multipoint MRC-WPT system with one transmitter delivering wireless power to a set of distributed receivers. We aim to introduce new applications of signal processing and optimization techniques to the performance characterization and optimization in multiuser WPT via MRC. We first derive closed-form expressions for the power drawn from the energy source at the transmitter and that delivered to the load at each receiver. We identify a "near-far" fairness issue in multiuser power transmission due to receivers' distance-dependent mutual inductance with the transmitter. To tackle this issue, we propose a centralized charging control algorithm to jointly optimize the receivers' load resistance to minimize the total transmitter power drawn while meeting the given power requirement of each individual load. For ease of practical implementation, we also devise a distributed algorithm for the receivers to adjust their load resistance independently in an iterative manner. Last, we characterize the power region that constitutes all the achievable power-tuples of the loads via controlling their <b>adjustable</b> <b>resistance.</b> In particular, we compare the power regions without versus with the time sharing of users' power transmission, where it is shown that time sharing yields a larger power region in general.

40|$|Background: Pompe {{disease is}} an {{autosomal}} recessive metabolic disorder {{caused by the}} deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase. This deficiency leads to glycogen accumulation in the lysosomes of muscle tissue causing progressive muscular weakness particularly of the respiratory system. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has demonstrated efficacy in slowing down disease progression in infants. Despite {{the large number of}} studies describing the effects of physical training in juvenile and adult late onset Pompe disease (LOPD). There are very few reports that analyze the benefits of respiratory muscle rehabilitation or training. Methods: The effectiveness of respiratory muscle training was investigated using a specific appliance with <b>adjustable</b> <b>resistance</b> (Threshold). The primary endpoint was effect on respiratory muscular strength by measurements of MIP and MEP. Eight late-onset Pompe patients (aged 13 to 58  years; 4 female, 4 male) with respiratory muscle deficiency on functional respiratory tests were studied. All patients received ERT at the dosage of 20  mg/kg/every 2  weeks and underwent training with Threshold at specified pressures for 24  months. Results: A significant increase in MIP was observed during the follow-up of 24  month: 39. 6  cm H 2 O (+ 25. 0 %) at month 3; 39. 5  cm H 2 O (+ 24. 9 %) at month 6; 39. 1  cm H 2 O (+ 23. 7 %) at month 9; 37. 3  cm H 2 O (+ 18. 2 %) at month 12; and 37. 3  cm H 2 O (+ 17. 8 %) at month 24.

40|$|Rising {{levels of}} obesity {{in the past}} decade have been {{primarily}} attributed to an increasing sedentary population. Whilst a large majority of adults report using physical activity to lose weight, many individuals have difficulty sustaining exercise. Particularly for those who are not able to exercise using their lower body (due to injury, cardiac impairment, neurological disorder, paraplegia, or amputation), there exist limited means for cardioVascular exercise. Traditional upper body exercise occurs largely in the form of arm ergometry, which tends to quickly fatigue users by repeatedly activating a small muscle mass without allowing adequate time for recovery before reactivation. Moreover, to perform exercise more effectively, increasing the energy expenditure rate for a given exertion level may be extremely beneficial. Thus the aim of this work is to develop a new upper body cardiovascular exercise machine that increases energy expenditure above that observed in current machines for a given rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Major determinant~ofenergy expenditure and RPE were first identified and used to explain metabolic rate differences between cardiovascular exercise modes. Various factors such as exercising muscle mass, recruitment patterns, contraction velocity, and contraction type were found to significantly affect energy expenditure rate. RPE was determined to be jointly influenced by both physiological and psychological factors. Physiological determinants were separated into two categories: local factors relating to aches,cramps'lpain, and fatigue in exercising muscles and central factors relating to oxygen uptake, respiratory rate, heart rate, and ventilatory rate during exercise. A comprehensive table of upper body joint movements, associated muscle masses, ranges of movement, and PElak torques was 'th~p. created to better understand the various types of limb movements and characteriStic properties associated with activated muscle. The table was used to generate a range of new ~ercise sequences designed to increase muscle activation, range of motion, and to achieve a duty cycle whereby active phases for a specific muscle are followed by relaxation phases. Since exercise machines traditionally used during testing have been limited to commercially available equipment, it has historically been difficult to study new types of exercise movements.

METHODS: Under general anesthesia, the AGDD was implanted on seven white New Zealand rabbits for a duration of 4 months under a scleral flap in a way analogous to the Ex-PRESS device and set in an operationally closed position. The IOP was measured {{on a regular basis}} on the operated and control eyes using a rebound tonometer. Once a month the AGDD was adjusted noninvasively from its fully closed to its fully open position and the resulting pressure drop was measured. The contralateral eye was not operated and served as control. After euthanization, the eyes were collected for histology evaluation. RESULTS: The mean preoperative IOP was 11. 1 ± 2. 4 mm Hg. The IOP was significantly lower for the operated eye (6. 8 ± 2 mm Hg) compared to the nonoperated eye (13. 1 ± 1. 6 mm Hg) during the first 8 days after surgery. When opening the AGDD from its fully closed to fully open position, the IOP dropped significantly from 11. 2 ± 2. 9 to 4. 8 ± 0. 9 mm Hg (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract Background Adjustable shunts {{are very}} popular in the {{management}} of hydrocephalus and are believed to help in minimizing the number of surgical revisions. The drawback with almost all constructions is that they may be accidentally readjusted in relatively weak magnetic fields (around 30 – 40 mTesla) Materials and methods The ProGav Miethke shunt is composed of an adjustable ballon-spring valve unit and an integrated over-drainage compensating gravitational device (known as the shunt assistant). A mechanical 'brake' is intended to prevent changes to the valve's performance level in a strong magnetic field. We evaluated the performance and hydrodynamic properties of a sample of three valves in the UK Shunt Evaluation Laboratory. Results All the shunts showed good mechanical durability over the three-month period of testing, and good stability of hydrodynamic performance over a one-month period The pressure-flow performance curves, operating, opening and closing pressures fell within the limits specified by the manufacturer, and changed according to the programmed performance levels. The operating pressure increased when the shunt assistant was in the vertical position, as specified. The valve has a low hydrodynamic resistance (0. 53 mm mmHg ml - 1 min - 1). External programming proved to be easy and reliable. Strong magnetic fields from a 3 Tesla MR scanner were not able to change the programming of the valve.

30|$|Thanks {{to direct}} {{coupling}} between the rotor speed {{and the system}} frequency, a Type 1 Induction Generator with Fixed Speed can potentially provide limited inertial response. Its inertial response is a passive process, in which the kinetic energy stored in the generator, gearbox and wind blades is intrinsically released or absorbed as system frequency decreases or increases. Commercial fixed speed wind turbines (FSWT) with rated power above 1 MW have an inertial constant of 3 – 5 s. The stored energy in each FSWT is unrelated to wind speed, and the aggregated kinetic energy of a WPP increases {{with the number of}} turbines online [71]. However, it is difficult to tune the inertial response of Type 1 in order to meet specific grid frequency regulation requirements. Overall, the inertial response from Type 1 WTGs is restricted and uncontrollable. The Type 2 Wound-rotor Induction Generator with <b>adjustable</b> external rotor <b>resistance</b> and variable slip tends to maintain its power output at a fixed value even during an abrupt frequency decline, since the external rotor resistance maintains the power output at the target value at all times. Therefore, Type 2 WTGs hardly make any contribution to the system inertial response [6, 16].|$|R

Objective: To design and test a new tracheostoma valve to improve existing tracheostoma valves. Methods: The tracheostoma valve closes by means of strong inhalation {{so that all the}} air that is exhaled is available for phonation. The device automatically stays in the "speaking position" until the patient deliberately changes the device to the "breathing position" by a fast expiration. If all the air that has been exhaled has been consumed during phonation, the patient can inhale again, without changing the device, because a small valve automatically opens, thus allowing phonation without time limits. An experimental setup with a computer-based acquisition program was used to measure the pressure at which the valve opened and the flow at which the valve closed. The pressure and flow needed to open and close the magnetic adjustable valve were measured for different positions and contained in the computer through a data acquisition program.

The device appears to function well in physiological ranges and is optimally <b>adjustable.</b> The airflow <b>resistance</b> coefficient lies in the range of the entire airway resistance (1. 2 ⋅ 102 - 4. 7 ⋅ 102 [Pa ⋅ s 2 ⋅ l- 2]) in quiet breathing...|$|R
40|$|The rise of {{resistance}} {{together with the}} shortage of new broad-spectrum antibiotics underlines the urgency of optimizing the use of available drugs to minimize disease burden. Theoretical studies suggest that coordinating empirical usage of antibiotics in a hospital ward can contain the spread {{of resistance}}. However, theoretical and clinical studies came to different conclusions regarding the usefulness of rotating first-line therapy (cycling). Here, we performed a quantitative pathogen-specific meta-analysis of clinical studies comparing cycling to standard practice. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar and identified 46 clinical studies addressing the effect of cycling on nosocomial infections, of which 11 met our selection criteria. We employed a method for multivariate meta-analysis using incidence rates as endpoints and find that cycling reduced the incidence rate/ 1000 patient days of both total infections by 4. 95 [9. 43 - 0. 48] and resistant infections by 7. 2 [14. 00 - 0. 44]. This positive effect was observed in most pathogens despite a large variance between individual species. Our findings remain robust in uni- and multivariate metaregressions. We used theoretical models that reflect various infections and hospital settings to compare cycling to random assignment to different drugs (mixing). We make the realistic assumption that therapy is changed when first line treatment is ineffective, which we call "adjustable cycling/mixing". In concordance with earlier theoretical studies, we find that in strict regimens, cycling is detrimental. However, in <b>adjustable</b> regimens single <b>resistance</b> is suppressed and cycling is successful in most settings. Both a meta-regression and our theoretical model indicate that "adjustable cycling" is especially useful to suppress emergence of multiple resistance. While our model predicts that cycling periods of one month perform well, we expect that too long cycling periods are detrimental. Our results suggest that "adjustable cycling" suppresses multiple resistance and warrants further investigations that allow comparing various diseases and hospital settings. status: publishe...|$|R
