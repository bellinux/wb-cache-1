5|$|Egan and the {{trustees}} of St. Mary's established a singing school in 1804, {{with the goal}} of improving the quality of the choir there. The following year was consumed by another yellow fever outbreak, and Egan joined John Rossiter, the pastor of another of Philadelphia's four Catholic churches, St. Joseph's, in ministering to the sick. In 1806, they worked with the parishioners of a third church, Holy Trinity, to found an orphanage, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of orphaned children had been made worse by the yellow fever deaths.|$|E
5|$|In the {{weighted}} maximum clique problem, the input is an undirected graph with weights on its vertices (or, less frequently, edges) and the output is a clique with maximum total weight. The maximum clique {{problem is the}} special case in which all weights are equal. As well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of optimizing the sum of weights, other more complicated bicriterion optimization problems have also been studied.|$|E

25|$|Schrödinger's cat is {{a thought}} experiment, usually {{described}} as a paradox, devised by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935. It illustrates what he saw <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics applied to everyday objects. The thought experiment presents a cat that might be alive or dead, depending on an earlier random event. In the course of developing this experiment, he coined the term Verschränkung (entanglement).|$|E
25|$|Discussion {{regarding}} destiny {{does not}} necessitate {{the existence of}} supernatural powers. Logical determinism or determinateness {{is the notion that}} all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false.

25|$|In {{the year}} 1882, the railway of Horonai was {{completed}} (官営幌内鉄道, Kan'ei Horonai Tetsudō), the third railway of the Japanese empire connecting the mine with the Otaru harbor. Also, the government {{decided to build}} the prison of sorachi in Mikasa (空知監獄). Thus the problem of overcrowded prisons as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of insufficient labour power in the mine were solved. Between 1883 and 1894, this prison provided an average of 720 prison miners a year, making up 80 {{percent of the total}} workforce.|$|E
25|$|Islands of the West, {{a former}} name: from the Spanish name Las islas de Poniente, adopted {{in order to}} assert their {{ownership}} by Spain {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Tordesillas; the Portuguese, who (correctly, as it happens) felt the islands fell within their sphere, instead called them Ilhas do oriente ("Islands of the East"). <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of longitude had not been solved, and as the islands had no spice to attract conflict, López de Legazpi successfully colonized the islands for Philip II in 1565.|$|E
25|$|His work led Congress to {{commission}} {{a study in}} 1926–1927 of the overall condition of Native Americans in the United States. The results were called the Meriam Report. Published in 1928 <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Problem</b> of Indian Administration, the Meriam Report revealed the failures of federal Indian policies and how they had contributed to severe problems with Native American education, health, and poverty. Collier's efforts, including {{the publication of the}} report, raised the visibility of Native American issues within the federal government. The Great Depression brought a harsher economic environment for most Native Americans. The administration of President Herbert Hoover reorganized the BIA and provided it with major funding increases.|$|E

25|$|Another {{strand of}} {{opposition}} to Malthus's ideas started {{in the middle of}} the 19th century with the writings of Friedrich Engels (Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy, 1844) and Karl Marx (Capital, 1867). Engels and Marx argued that what Malthus saw <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of the pressure of population on the means of production actually represented the pressure of the means of production on population. They thus viewed it in terms of their concept of the reserve army of labour. In other words, the seeming excess of population that Malthus attributed to the seemingly innate disposition of the poor to reproduce beyond their means actually emerged as a product of the very dynamic of capitalist economy.|$|E
25|$|According to Fisher (1970), {{there are}} four phases of decision-making: orientation, conflict, emergence, and reinforcement. As a {{communicative}} approach, the orientation stage is where the members involved are becoming acquainted both with themselves as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> at hand. The conflict stage is {{where the problem is}} analyzed with several possibilities presented to resolve the problem. Upon discussing these possibilities, the emergence phase becomes known when a decision is made about which solution is to be used. The reinforcement stage is the supportive of the decision. These phases are not without objection from many theorists in the field. Morley and Stephenson (1977) claim that such a staged model of decision-making is not so rigid between phases and varies depending upon the types of decisions made.|$|E
25|$|These ants are {{not hard}} to control, and most ant killers will solve problems, {{especially}} if controlled as soon <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> is noticed. At this point, they could be put under control {{in just a few}} days. However, the longer someone waits, the larger the population is and the longer it will take to control the situation, possibly a few weeks. Standing water should be eliminated, as odorous house ants are attracted to moisture. Plants should be trimmed back so they cannot be used to get inside. Cracks, holes and joints should be sealed with polyurethane foam or caulk, especially those that are near the ground. Firewood, rocks and other materials should not be stored next to a home because it encourages nest building. People should {{be on the lookout for}} these ants in late winter and early spring (particularly after rain), as this is when they most commonly appear.|$|E
