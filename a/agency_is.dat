5|$|Feminist economists {{also point}} out that <b>agency</b> <b>is</b> not {{available}} to everyone, such as children, the sick, and the frail elderly. Responsibilities for their care can compromise the agency of caregivers as well. This is a critical departure from the homo economicus model.|$|E

5|$|As 241Am has {{a roughly}} similar {{half-life}} to 238Pu (432.2 years vs. 87 years), {{it has been}} proposed as an active element of radioisotope thermoelectric generators, for example in spacecraft. Although americium produces less heat and electricity – the power yield is 114.7mW/g for 241Am and 6.31mW/g for 243Am (cf. 390mW/g for 238Pu) – and its radiation poses more threat to humans owing to neutron emission, the European Space <b>Agency</b> <b>is</b> considering using americium for its space probes.|$|E

50|$|Government <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> {{often given}} names ending in directorate, inspectorate, {{administration}} (verk) or authority. Among the organisations organised as <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> the universities and colleges. All government <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> audited by the Office of the Auditor General of Norway. Municipalities and counties often divide their organization into etats, {{with only the}} central administration left in the core.

5|$|In the United States, the Environmental Protection <b>Agency</b> <b>is</b> {{charged with}} {{regulating}} and managing mercury contamination. Several laws give the EPA this authority, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Additionally, the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act, passed in 1996, phases out {{the use of}} mercury in batteries, and provides for the efficient and cost-effective disposal of many types of used batteries. North America contributed approximately 11% of the total global anthropogenic mercury emissions in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Since that time, most US space {{exploration}} {{efforts have been}} led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. Currently, NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing {{the development of the}} Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The <b>agency</b> <b>is</b> also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches.|$|E
50|$|The {{worldwide}} {{commission rate}} for advertising <b>agencies</b> <b>is</b> fixed at 15% {{of the total}} billing. This is {{the only source of}} income they earn from media. The 15% must cover costs such as payroll, fixed and variable costs. <b>Agencies</b> <b>are</b> demanding to increase the commission rate but clients are not even willing to give the 15% even though it's the only source of revenue for the <b>Agency.</b> There <b>are</b> cases that <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> forced to lower their rates to the level of 5% to 10% due to competition. So in some cases there <b>are</b> <b>agencies</b> that <b>are</b> not even getting the fixed 15%.|$|R

5|$|Superfund {{sites are}} {{designated}} as {{being among the}} nation's worst areas with respect to toxic and hazardous waste. The Environmental Protection <b>Agency</b> <b>is</b> the federal agency that determines if a particular site is hazardous, prepares {{a course of action}} to reduce the hazard, and finds the parties responsible for the pollution. If a site is listed with the Superfund program, federal dollars are available for cleanup.|$|E
5|$|The Environment <b>Agency</b> <b>is</b> the {{navigation}} {{authority for the}} river, which is navigable as far upstream as Crowland, and with very shallow draught to West Deeping Bridge, where further progress is hindered by the derelict lock around the weir. The traditional head of navigation was Wharf Road in Stamford. The management of the lower river has been intimately tied up with the drainage of Deeping Fen, and the river remains important to the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board, for whom it provides the final conduit to the sea for pumped water.|$|E

5|$|Ambulances {{may also}} carry an emblem (either {{as part of}} the passive warning {{markings}} or not), such as a Red Cross, Red Crescent or Red Crystal (collective known as the Protective Symbols). These are symbols laid down by the Geneva Convention, and all countries signatory to it agree to restrict their use to either (1) Military Ambulances or (2) the national Red Cross or Red Crescent society. Use by any other person, organization or <b>agency</b> <b>is</b> in breach of international law. The protective symbols are designed to indicate to all people (especially combatants in the case of war) that the vehicle is neutral and is not to be fired upon, hence giving protection to the medics and their casualties, although this has not always been adhered to. In Israel, Magen David Adom, the Red Cross member organization use a red Star of David, but this does not have recognition beyond Israeli borders, where they must use the Red Crystal.|$|E

40|$|Competent public <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> {{associated}} with better economic outcomes. Beyond competence, political leaders need {{to secure the}} loyalty of their agencies. Unfortunately, several theories predict a tradeoff between these two valued features. This paper finds that recruitment into <b>agencies</b> <b>is</b> meritocratic where (1) agency officials have poor outside options, (2) careers in <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> long-lasting, and (3) <b>agency</b> loyalty <b>is</b> important. Moreover, <b>agency</b> competence <b>is</b> lower when (4) loyalty is important but the time horizon is short, and (5) outside opportunities improve but the time horizon is long. This evidence fits best with a theory of loyalty as non-contractible behavior...|$|R

5|$|Running {{parallel}} to the main high street is a leat with a public footpath running along it. The leat runs from Head Weir, north of Cullompton, and takes its water from the Spratford Stream. It flows past three former watermills (Upper, Middle and Lower Mill) and then empties into the Culm near First Bridge. It is uncertain when the leat was first made but {{the south end of}} the leat and Lower Mill are shown on an early seventeenth-century map. The leat is no longer in use for powering mills and the Environment <b>Agency</b> <b>is</b> not interested in managing the leat nor keeping it flowing so the Cullompton Leat Conservancy Board was formed to restore and maintain the Leat in 2005.|$|E
