40|$|CDATA[Background: Adolescence – {{a period}} of {{transition}} between childhood and adulthood is a significant period of human growth and maturation. Adolescents represent {{about a fifth of}} India’s population. Many studies in recent times have highlighted the high prevalence of anaemia <b>among</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls in India; however, there is limited published literature on prevalence of anaemia <b>among</b> <b>adolescent</b> boys. Aims: To find out the prevalence of anaemia <b>among</b> <b>adolescent</b> (10 - 19 years) boys and girls in the urban slum of Meerut and to study socio-demographic and other determinants in relation to anaemia. Material and Methods: A Community based cross sectional study was conducted in urban slum, Multan nagar, catchment area of UHTC, Department of Community Medicine, Subharti Medical College, Meerut. A total of 406 (216 females and 190 males) adolescents were included in this study. Haemoglobin estimation was done using Direct Cyanmethaemoglobin method. Statistical analysis were done using Microsoft excel 2007 and Epi info version 3. 5. 3. Results: The prevalence of anaemia <b>among</b> <b>adolescent</b> males and females was found to be 31. 6 % and 52. 8 % respectively. Statistical significant association (p< 0. 05) of anaemia among boys were found with type of family, socio-economic status, educational status, academic performance, hand washing before eating main meal, daily frequency of main meals, daily consumption of lemon/sour fruits and BMI. Conclusions: A high prevalence of anaemia was found <b>among</b> <b>adolescent</b> males and females. So there is the need for routine iron supplementation even <b>among</b> <b>adolescent</b> boys. ]]...|$|R

40|$|THE IMPACT OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND IRON TABLETS ON PHYSICAL FITNESS AND IRON STATUS <b>AMONG</b> <b>ADOLESCENT.</b> Background: Iron {{deficiency}} anemia (IDA), {{as measured}} by hemoglobin level below normal value, is the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency in Indonesia. IDA <b>among</b> <b>adolescent</b> {{has been shown in}} some studies not only affect health status but also on decreasing learning concentration and physical fitness. So far, iron supplementation has been shown to improve iron status effectively and theoretically may also improve physical fitness among high risk groups especially adolescent. Objectives: To determine the effect of aerobic exercise and iron supplementation on physical fitness and iron status <b>among</b> <b>adolescent.</b> Methods: The subjects were adolescent boys aged 13 - 19 years old suffering from IDA In three Islamic boarding schools (Pondok Pesantren). A total of 181 selected subjects were assigned into two groups. The intervention group received iron tablet and aerobic exercise 3 times a week, while the control group received only iron tablet 3 times a week for the period of 7 weeks. Variables included in the study were health status assessed by physical examination by medical doctor, hemoglobin concentration, serum transferrin level, and cardiovascular endurance which were assessed before and after the intervention. Cardiovaskular endurance w{{as measured by}} time needed to run for the distance of 2400 meters. Results: The results showed that the prevalence of IDA <b>among</b> <b>adolescent</b> of Islamic boarding school was 40 percent.

25|$|Cardiometabolic risk among {{children}} and adolescents is fueled by the rising prevalence of obesity in this age group. From 1980 to 2008, rates of obesity have increased from 5% to 10% among preschool children aged 2–5.
