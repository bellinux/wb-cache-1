A strategy of priority queuing TCP <b>Acknowledgements</b> is trialled on a low bandwidth link {{in an attempt to}} enhance the forward TCP throughput.

She returned to Iraq on February 11, with no <b>acknowledgement</b> from WikiLeaks that they had received the files.|$|E
5|$|Operations in Borneo were {{extremely}} sensitive and they received little press coverage in Australia, while official <b>acknowledgement</b> {{of involvement in}} cross-border missions only occurred in 1996. Following a military coup in Indonesia in early 1966 which brought General Suharto to power, a peace treaty was signed in August 1966 which ended the conflict. 3,500 Australians served during Confrontation; casualties included 16 dead, with seven killed in action and eight wounded.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{military}} began targeting {{food crops}} in October 1962, primarily using Agent Blue; the American public {{was not made}} aware of the crop destruction programs until 1965 (and it was then believed that crop spraying had begun that spring). In 1965, 42 percent of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops. The first official <b>acknowledgement</b> of the programs came from the State Department in March 1966.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his first}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, about three months after taking office at the end of May 1723. A festive service at the Nikolaikirche was an annual event, celebrating the inauguration of a new town council, always held on the Monday after St. Bartholomew (August 24). The text by an anonymous poet includes psalm verses and an excerpt from Martin Luther's German Te Deum. It is focused on <b>acknowledgement</b> of authority as a gift of God, thanks for past blessings, and prayer for future help.|$|E
5|$|Display of British and Singapore ensigns on island. Ensigns, {{associated}} with maritime matters, are marks of nationality and not sovereignty. Singapore had also not demonstrated any sovereign intent in the flying of the British and Singapore ensigns from Horsburgh Lighthouse. The Pulau Pisang incident {{was not an}} <b>acknowledgement</b> by Malaysia of Singapore's sovereignty over Pedra Branca; {{it had been a}} matter of domestic political sensibility – Pulau Pisang is much larger than Pedra Branca and has a small local population.|$|E
5|$|Following the sinking, a Board of Inquiry was {{established}} to investigate the loss. Based on its findings, Captain Loben Maund was court-martialled in February 1942 for negligence. He was found guilty on two counts of negligence: one of failing to ensure that properly constituted damage control parties had remained on board after the general evacuation, and one of failing to ensure the ship was in a sufficient state of readiness to deal with possible damage. The board tempered their judgement with an <b>acknowledgement</b> that a high standard was being expected of Maund, {{and that he was}} primarily concerned with the welfare of his crew.|$|E

5|$|Her first <b>acknowledgement</b> on the {{national}} level was her appointment in 1919 to honorary vice president of the American Jewish Congress (AJC). Traditionally, the AJC leadership were more focused on European Jews than worldwide outreach and were of the aristocratic, wealthy, Reform tradition. By 1919 the organization had become more diverse and while not necessarily embracing the more radical aspects of Zionism, leaders allowed Zionist views to be expressed. Silverman, as an honorary official, could use the status to her advantage: while not officially speaking for the organization, she tacitly had AJC endorsement and was able to parlay that into support from the masses for causes and monetary contributions from elites.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} any <b>acknowledgement</b> of the mutual {{existence}} between the scriptores, only Flavius Vopiscus (ostensibly writing in 305 or 306) refers {{to any of}} the other authors (specifically Trebellius Pollio, Julius Capitolinus and Aelius Lampridius). None of the other five demonstrate any awareness of the existence of any of their 'colleagues'. However, these references cause difficulties when these authors also address Constantine in their dedications, as Vopiscus was also doing. For instance, Capitolinus mostly addresses Diocletian, but in the Albinus, Maximini and Gordiani he addresses Constantine in a fashion that suggests he is writing after 306.|$|E
5|$|King of the North Robb Stark visits his {{prisoner}} Jaime Lannister, informing Jaime that Robb {{has received}} Stannis' letter about Cersei's children being Jaime's, and surmises {{that his brother}} Bran was crippled and his father was killed because they had discovered this themselves. Robb also informs Jaime {{that he intends to}} send Jaime's cousin, Alton Lannister, who also has been captured by the Northern army, to King's Landing with terms for peace. His demands include the release of his sisters Sansa and Arya, the return of the remains of Eddard and his household for proper burial, and the <b>acknowledgement</b> of the Northern independence.|$|E
