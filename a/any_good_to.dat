500|$|In November, Ljotić intervened {{on behalf}} of 300–500 men {{detained}} by the Germans as suspected Freemasons.

According to his personal secretary, Ljotić also asked Turner to not order the killing of Jews, stating [...] " [...] against Jews ruling my country's economy, but I am against their murder." [...] He added that [...] "their innocently-spilled blood cannot bring <b>any</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> the people who do this."

500|$|The family {{returned}} to Downe on 27 August, and Darwin again {{wrote to the}} Gardeners' Chronicle appealing for assistance as he was [...] "very anxious to examine a few exotic forms". His requests to the wealthy enthusiasts who had taken up the fashionable pursuit of growing rare orchids brought large numbers of specimens. These would be a test of his theory: previously aspects such as coloration {{of plants and animals}} had often been regarded as having no adaptive function. For example, Thomas Henry Huxley was strongly influenced by German idealism and in 1856 had asked if it was [...] "to be supposed for a moment that the beauty of colour and outline... are <b>any</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> the animals?... Who has ever dreamed of finding an utilitarian purpose in the forms and colours of flowers... ?" [...] Darwin had, and in the orchids he tackled the most difficult case. His ideas would transform the way naturalists thought about coloration.|$|E

Mulroney criticizes Trudeau for avoiding military service in World War II, and favourably references sources that describe the young Trudeau as holding anti-Semitic nationalist views and having an admiration for fascist dictators.
