Italy has also recorded 516 bird species and 56213 invertebrates species.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Alpine</b> <b>shrew</b> {{is found}} in the {{mountains}} and uplands of Central and Eastern Europe and parts of France. Its range includes the Alps, the Black Forest, the Jura Mountains, the mountains of southern Germany, the Krkonoše, the Beskids, the Tatra Mountains, the Carpathian Mountains, the Transylvanian Alps, the uplands of Vosges and the mountains of the former Yugoslavia. The <b>Alpine</b> <b>shrew</b> {{is found in}} Alpine meadows and in coniferous woodland at elevations between about 200 and 2500 m. It sometimes occurs above the tree line but more normally favours damp pastures and swampy ground near small streams in areas with dwarf sparse conifers near the upper limit of tree cover. It tends to lurk in dense vegetation, occupies rock crevices and lives under boulders or fallen branches and often occurs near mountain huts.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Alpine</b> <b>shrew</b> is nocturnal and is {{a skilled}} climber, using its tail for balance. It uses scent glands on its flanks to mark its territory. Like other shrew species, it has a high {{metabolic}} rate and needs to feed frequently. It eats insects, spiders, snails and earthworms and is in turn the prey of foxes, weasels, domestic cats and tawny owls.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Alpine</b> <b>shrew</b> {{is listed}} as [...] "Near Threatened" [...] in the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species. This is because it {{occupies}} a number of separate, disjunct mountain regions {{and seems to be}} slowly declining in numbers. It may be threatened by habitat destruction as hydro-electric schemes and increased tourism impact its environment. It used to be present in the Pyrenees but has not been seen there for many years and may be extinct there, nor has it been seen recently in the Harz Mountain region of Germany.|$|E
50|$|The {{wildlife}} in the Rhön mountains {{is similar to}} that of other low mountain ranges, but there are also some unusual species. In addition to the more common mammals such as roe deer, fox, badger, hare and wild boar, there are also smaller mammals such as the dormouse, common water shrew and Miller's water shrew. One unusual regional species is the <b>alpine</b> <b>shrew.</b> Birds occurring here include the black grouse, the capercaillie, the black stork, the eagle owl, the corncrake, the red-backed shrike and the wryneck. There are also two species endemic to the Rhön: the rove beetle and a local snail, the Rhönquellschnecke (Bythinella compressa).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Alpine</b> <b>shrew</b> is 6 to 7.7 cm in length, not {{including}} a tail {{as long as}} its body, and weighs between 5.5 and 11.5 g. It is a uniform greyish-black on its dorsal (upper) surface and greyish-brown on its underparts. The tips of its teeth are reddish-brown {{and it has a}} long pointed snout, small black eyes and rounded pink ears. Its legs and feet are white and the underside of its hairy tail is yellowish. Juveniles are somewhat paler than adults. It shares its range with the common shrew Sorex araneus and the Eurasian pygmy shrew Sorex minutus but is distinguishable from these by its darker fur and longer tail.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Alpine</b> <b>shrew</b> (Sorex alpinus Schinz, 1837) {{is a small}} {{member of}} family Soricidae, which is found in {{mountain}} forests of central and south Europe. Its patchy range includes the Alps, the NW Balkans, the Carpathians, and some isolated mountain areas in Germany, Czech Republic and Poland. The disjunct range of <b>Alpine</b> <b>shrew</b> presumably results from range dynamics of the species connected with Pleistocene climate oscillation. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate phylogeographical structure of the <b>Alpine</b> <b>shrew</b> in the central and SE European mountain systems. To examine genetic structure of <b>Alpine</b> <b>shrew</b> populations the hypervariable domain of the mitochondrial control region was used. We processed 51 samples from 18 localities, covering the majority of the distributional area of the species. Final sequence dataset was analyzed using population and landscape genetic approaches. Results revealed shallow mitochondrial genealogy with differentiation among haplogroups. This pattern, together with demographic analyses suggest population expansion, corroborated with the hypothesis that during glacial periods the <b>Alpine</b> <b>shrew</b> expanded. End of the last ice period was followed by fragmentation of the species range and its retreat to higher elevations and formation of relict populations. Key words: shrews, [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Phylogenetic analyses, {{based on}} partial medium- and large-segment sequences, support an ancient {{evolutionary}} origin of a genetically distinct hantavirus detected by reverse transcription–PCR in tissues of northern short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda) captured in Minnesota in August 1998. To our knowledge, {{this is the}} fi rst evidence of hantaviruses harbored by shrews in the Americas. Rodents and their ectoparasites serve as reservoirs and vectors of myriad viruses and other pathogenic microbes. In contrast, the role of insectivores (or soricomorphs) in the transmission and ecology of zoonoses is largely unknown. Because some soricomorphs share habitats with rodents, shrews might also {{be involved in the}} maintenance of the enzootic cycle and contribute to the evolutionary history and genetic diversity of hantaviruses. Hantavirus antigens have been detected in the Eurasian common shrew (Sorex araneus), <b>alpine</b> <b>shrew</b> (Sorex alpinus), Eurasian water shrew (Neomys fodiens), and common mole (Talpa europea) in Russia and the former Yugoslavia (1 – 3). More than 20 years ago, when Prospect Hill virus was discovered in meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) captured in Frederick, Maryland, USA, serologic evidence suggestive of hantavirus infection was found in the northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) (4). However, virus isolation attempts were unsuccessful, and molecular tools such as PCR were unavailable. Empowered by robust gene-amplification techniques and the complete genome of Thottapalayam virus (TPMV) isolated from the Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus) (5, 6), we have identified a genetically distinct hantavirus in the northern shorttailed shrew...|$|E
40|$|Sequence {{analysis}} of the full-length medium segment and the partial small and large segments of a hantavirus, detected by reverse transcription–PCR in lung tissues of the Chinese mole shrew (Anourosorex squamipes) captured in Cao Bang Province, Vietnam, in December 2006, indicated that it is genetically distinct from rodentborne hantaviruses. Insectivores (or soricomorphs) have been largely ignored as being important in the evolutionary dynamics of hantaviruses, despite the isolation of Thottapalayam virus (TPMV) from the Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus) (1, 2) and the detection of hantavirus antigens in tissues of the Eurasian common shrew (Sorex araneus), <b>alpine</b> <b>shrew</b> (S. alpinus), Eurasian water shrew (Neomys fodiens), and common mole (Talpa europea) (3). Recently, genetically distinct hantavirus sequences have been found by reverse transcription–PCR in the Therese shrew (Crocidura theresae) in Guinea (4) and the northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) in the United States (5). In addition, a phylogenetically distinct hantavirus has been isolated from lung tissues of the Ussuri shrew (C. lasiura), captured along the Imjin River near the demilitarized zone in South Korea (J. -W. Song and R. Yanagihara, unpub. data). The Study To further investigate the existence and phylogeny of nonrodentborne hantaviruses, we analyzed lung and other visceral tissues, collected in RNAlater Stabilization Reagent (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA), from 24 soricomorphs, including 9 white-toothed shrews (Crocidura spp.), 3 Chinese mole shrews (Anourosorex squamipes), and 12 longnosed moles (Euroscaptor longirostris), captured in northern, central, and southern Vietnam during November and December 2006.

40|$|ON FAUNA OF INTEREST TO HUNTERSIN THE FRENCH ALPS - Both for Mammalia and Birds the Alps offer special biologicalconditions, {{very similar}} to those of the polar regions, but differingby the regular diurnal changes of day and night. Thepresent alpine fauna is paleontologically of mixed origin : arctic,mediterranean and oriental. Its whole history is {{dominated}} bythe glacial period. At the end of the latter, a few species of thearctic fauna (The Reindeer, the Wolverene, the Musk-Ox) havemoved up northwards and without settling in the mountainswhich do not suit them. But, on the other hand, the Lynx, theVariable Hare and the Common Ptarmigan present alpine, aswell as nordic forms. The eastern element is represented bythe Ibex, the Chamois and the Rock Partridge. The mediterraneanelements, few in number, are all birds, of which somemust be looked upon as autochtonous and preglacial : the SnowVole, the <b>alpine</b> <b>Shrew,</b> the Bearded Vulture, the water-ousel,the alpine crows. Water fowl from the North may stop in thecourse of their peregrinations, but none of them makes its nestthere. Before turning to the alpine animals of special interest to thehunter it may be stated that the Red-deer still survived in theAlps (of Savoy) as recently as about 1870, and that the Wolf,who disappeared from the Dauphiné in 1883, had survived inthe Savoy country down to the end of the XIXth century. The author then overlooks the alpine Mammalia : the Ibex,whom Italian protection has succeeded in preserving; the Chamois,whose numbers have varied but who still exists ratherabundantly now adays; the Marmot, a hibernating animalbuilding burrows and hawing many biological peculiarities; theVariable Hare, who during the winter becomes entirely white; the Bear, who still survives in the Vercors region of the Dauphinéand on the border between the Dauphiné and the Savoy;finally the Lynx, who has almost entirely disappeared from theFrench Alps. Of the birds, the Capercaillie has, so to speak, gone from theFrench Alps. The Black Grouse, on the contrary, is still plentiful. The Hazel Hen lives in the woods, and the CommonPtarmigan, whose moulting is so interesting, is found on theupper pasture lands. Hunters frequently confound the RockPartridge with the Red-legged Partridge. Mention must finallybe made of the great birds of prey, the Golden Eagle, who becomesmore rare every year, and the Bearded Vulture, who isnearly extinct...|$|E
