5|$|A {{controversy}} arose regarding {{whether to}} lay natural or <b>artificial</b> <b>turf.</b> Kristofer Hæstad, one of Start's star players, {{stated that he}} would not continue to play for the club if <b>artificial</b> <b>turf</b> was laid. The contract with the municipality stated that the stadium would have to be built with <b>artificial</b> <b>turf.</b> In March, Start decided that they would instead lay natural grass, and if necessary pay the municipality for the cost of building another <b>artificial</b> <b>turf</b> venue. The name of the venue was announced on 21 October, after the club had signed a ten-year naming rights agreement with Sparebanken Sør worth NOK35 million. The rights to sell the naming rights were first transferred from the stadium owner to the company Rettighetskompaniet AS, which subsequently sold these to Sparebanken Sør.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of 1997, the {{municipal}} council granted NOK3.2 million to lay <b>artificial</b> <b>turf</b> at Dælenenga. Construction started in May and the pitch {{was taken into}} use on 4 September 1997. The new turf was Belgian-manufactured, sand-filled Superfoot 32. The upgrade also saw the first upgrades to the terraces in the stadium's history. New <b>artificial</b> <b>turf</b> was laid in 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, {{a project}} was started to bring Bodø/Glimt {{back to the}} top league. Among the most {{important}} issues was to secure better training facilities, particularly during the Arctic winter. The club proposed upgrading the <b>artificial</b> <b>turf</b> field at Aspmyra with a new field with under-soil heating, in addition to constructing both a new gravel pitch and an indoor training hall with a full-size pitch. The Municipal Committee for Sport and Culture stated that they wanted to prioritize the <b>artificial</b> <b>turf</b> field over a gravel pitch. They therefore proposed that NOK3.5 million be allocated to lay under-soil heating on the <b>artificial</b> <b>turf</b> pitch and remove the turf. New <b>artificial</b> <b>turf</b> would be laid at a later date, when funding could be allocated. This was agreed upon, construction started on 24 October 1989 and was scheduled for completion ahead of the winter training. However, the Football Association of Norway (NFF) stated that the club {{would not be allowed to}} play their matches on a gravel pitch, and the grass at Aspmyra was in so bad condition that it would not be permitted for play in the top league, should the team be promoted. The municipal council therefore gave grants to finance a new <b>artificial</b> <b>turf</b> on the training pitch, which was taken into use in 1990.|$|E

5|$|The {{stadium is}} part of Lerkendal idrettspark, which also {{consists}} of three training pitches, two in full size and of which one has <b>artificial</b> <b>turf.</b> The main training pitch is the natural grass Skoglunden, while the <b>artificial</b> <b>turf</b> venue is Lerkendal kunstgress. The two pitches both have flood lighting, heating and are often used for matches by Rosenborg's recruit and reserve teams. The team has a health club located within the south stand. The club's offices are located in Brakka, a German-built barracks dating from World War II.|$|E
5|$|Aspmyra Stadion is a {{football}} stadium in Bodø, Norway. Home of Bodø/Glimt and Grand Bodø, it holds {{a capacity for}} 7,354 spectators. The venue has three stands: a modern all-seater with roof, 100 club seats and 15 luxury boxes to the south, an unroofed all-seater {{to the east and}} an older grandstand with mixed sitting and standing to the north. The venue has floodlights and <b>artificial</b> <b>turf</b> with under-soil heating. Immediately south of the venue lies Aspmyra kunstgressbane, a training pitch with <b>artificial</b> <b>turf.</b> Aspmyra Stadion has hosted one Norway national football team match, against Iceland in 2002.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the wear of artificial sports pitch materials and characterise the wear mechanisms. The project was in collaboration with Notts Sports Ltd. who wished to compare the performance of existing pitches with potential new, improved <b>artificial</b> sports <b>turfs.</b> The various materials (from different manufacturers, and of differing pile yarn weight and worn in situ and new) were imaged by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to assess the tribological behaviour of the <b>artificial</b> sports <b>turfs.</b> X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was used to assess the structure of the <b>artificial</b> sports <b>turfs.</b> Pin on disk wear testing, tensile and fatigue testing was conducted on the <b>artificial</b> sports <b>turfs</b> to assess the wear life/mechanisms and how the structure performs under loading. Optical and scanning electron microscopy reveal the wear mechanisms can be identified by the damage incurred as either adhesive, or abrasive or both. Additionally a directionality in the mechanical properties of the materials was observed. Visual and structural investigation by X-ray CT revealed a directionality to the materials. X-ray CT also showed inconsistencies in the structure negatively affect the performance of the <b>artificial</b> sports <b>turfs,</b> which was seen to be the case with some tensile and fatigue experiments. MRI was explored but found not useful in assessing the structure of the <b>artificial</b> sports <b>turfs.</b> Wear testing showed different behaviour for differing <b>artificial</b> sports <b>turfs,</b> whilst the tensile and fatigue testing showed the orientation of the samples affects these properties, in that the horizontal orientation was stronger than vertical orientation. Tensile testing revealed the <b>artificial</b> sports <b>turfs</b> behave similarly to randomly orientated short fibre composites. Rawsons <b>artificial</b> sports <b>turfs</b> have more even fibre distribution in the horizontal and vertical directions in comparison to the Leigh Spinners <b>artificial</b> sports <b>turfs,</b> which has led to more uniform mechanical and tribological properties...|$|R

5|$|In {{the summer}} and fall of 2011, several renovations took place, {{affecting}} primarily the high school. All front-facing windows of the high school were replaced with energy-efficient windows, and a permanent-storage building was constructed on the northeast side to store auditorium and maintenance supplies. In addition, many of the computers in the school were replaced with thin client computers. In 2013, the school's cardiovascular and weight lifting center was improved with more machines and equipment, increased space, new flat screen televisions, and other additions. In 2013 and 2014, the school's fields on the property were remediated due to the use of contaminated fill. The football field was completed with <b>artificial</b> <b>turf,</b> as well as the track and <b>artificial</b> <b>turf</b> baseball field; an <b>artificial</b> <b>turf</b> hockey field was to be completed by Labor Day. The lower soccer field will be reconstructed after the fall 2014 soccer season. Work on the softball field was finished in fall 2013. A security plan is to be submitted to the New York State Education Department; it includes plans to upgrade the main entrance doors and construct vestibules and greeter stations.|$|E
