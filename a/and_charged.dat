40|$|The cell-surface <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> cell-surface {{hydrophobicity}} of 10 {{strains of}} Azospirillum spp. {{were evaluated by}} the aqueous, two-polymer phase partitioning assay. Azospirillum spp. had moderate cell-surface hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge,</b> lower than known values for human pathogens. The hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> values were higher in solid than in liquid media. A general pattern of modifying hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> by external treatments of the cells of all strains was not found, but various chemicals, temperatures, and enzymatic treatments changed the cell-surface hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> in different strains. A similar hydrophobic protein was isolated, and partially characterized, from two strains of A. brasilense and one strain of A. lipoferum. This study proposes: (i) cell-surface hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> of Azospirillum spp. can be affected by external treatments of the bacterium cell, and (ii) hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> may play a role, perhaps small, in the primary adsorption of Azospirillum spp. to surfaces...|$|R

5|$|At the marshal's signal, silence descended {{over the}} field and both knights spurred their horses <b>and</b> <b>charged,</b> their lances each {{striking}} the other's shield but not causing significant damage. Wheeling, both again struck but failed to penetrate, scoring glancing blows on their helmets but remaining horsed. For a third time they turned <b>and</b> <b>charged</b> and again they both struck. This time however the lances shattered, sending slivers of wood cartwheeling across the arena and nearly unseating both men. Regaining balance, the knights closed on one another with battle axes drawn, trading furious two-handed blows. As the engagement progressed, Le Gris' superior strength began to tell and Carrouges was driven back until with a mighty swing, Le Gris' axe severed the spine of Carrouges' horse. The dying beast tumbled to the ground, Carrouges leaping clear and meeting Le Gris' charge with a side-step, allowing him to thrust his own axe's pike deep into the stomach of Le Gris' steed.|$|E

40|$|Today, {{telematics}} services are o Aen compositions of different chargeable service components offered by different service providers. To enhance component-based accounting <b>and</b> <b>charging,</b> the service composition information {{is used to}} match with the corresponding charging structure of a service session. This enables the sharing of revenues among the service providers, and calculation of the total cost for the end-user. When multiple independent service providers are involved, {{it is a great}} challenge to apply interim accounting <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> during a service session in order to minimize financial risks between business partners. Another interesting development is the trend towards outsourcing accounting <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> processes to specialized business partners. This requires a decoupling between provisioning <b>and</b> accounting <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> processes. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive component-based accounting <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> architecture to support service session provisioning across multiple domains. The architecture, modeled in UML, incorporates an interim accounting <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> mechanism to enable the processing and exchange of accounting information needed to update intermediate charges for separate service components and the user’s credit, even during the service provisioning phase...|$|R

2500|$|While {{lifeline}} utility rate {{programs are}} intended to protect low income individuals, many other utility customers who don’t qualify for lifeline programs are adversely impacted by significant utility fee <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> increases by local water agencies.

[...] Many local utility customers believe it is unfair that they are effectively penalized with higher utility fees <b>and</b> <b>charges</b> as a result of utility customers conserving water. [...] If a local water agency is not responsive to the needs of its customers and raises water utility fees <b>and</b> <b>charges</b> too much, the local initiative power under Proposition 218 provides a remedy that can generally be used to reduce or repeal those utility fee <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> increases.|$|R
