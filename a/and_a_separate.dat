5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), or {{tungsten inert gas}} (TIG) welding, is a manual welding process that uses a nonconsumable tungsten electrode, an inert or semi-inert gas mixture, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> filler material. Especially useful for welding thin materials, this method {{is characterized by a}} stable arc and high quality welds, but it requires significant operator skill and can only be accomplished at relatively low speeds.|$|E

He decided to quickly attack Fevzi Pasha's Ottoman 7th Army in the Judean Hills {{with the hope of}} capturing Jerusalem. This would keep pressure on this army in the hope of denying them time to complete their reorganisation, dig deep trenches or worst of all, counterattack.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the status}} of its builder, Doune {{reflected}} current ideas of what a royal castle building should be. It was planned as a courtyard with ranges of buildings on each side, although only the northern and north-western buildings were completed. These comprise a large tower house over the entrance, containing the rooms of the Lord and his family, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> tower containing the kitchen and guest rooms. The two are linked by the great hall. The stonework is almost all from the late 14th century, with only minor repairs carried out in the 1580s. The restoration of the 1880s replaced the timber roofs and internal floors, as well as interior fittings.|$|E
5|$|Fender {{was bought}} by CBS in 1965. Rhodes stayed with the company, and {{released}} the first Fender Rhodes piano, a 73 note model. The instrument consisted of two components— the piano <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> enclosure containing the power amplifier and loudspeaker, which was placed underneath the former. Like the piano bass, it was finished in black tolex, and came with a fiberglass top. During the late 1960s, two models of the Fender Rhodes Celeste also became available, which used the top three or four octaves, respectively, of the Fender Rhodes piano. The Celeste did not sell particularly well and examples are now hard to find.|$|E
5|$|In 1779, after {{returning}} from France, Adams was also elected to the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention, {{to create a new}} constitution for Massachusetts. Once there, he served on a committee of three, also including Samuel Adams and James Bowdoin, to draft the constitution. The task of writing it fell primarily to John Adams. The resulting Constitution of Massachusetts was approved in 1780. It was the first constitution written by a special committee, then ratified by the people; and was also the first to feature a bicameral legislature. Included were a distinct executive – though restrained by an executive council – with a partial (two-thirds) veto, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> judicial branch.|$|E

5|$|InFamous {{is set in}} Empire City, {{a fictional}} {{metropolis}} based on New York City, consisting of the Neon District, where most of Empire City's businesses are concentrated, the Warren, a slum dependent on international shipping activity, and the Historic District, {{the location of the}} city government. Each district has an elevated train system <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> power grid. The premise of the game is built around the partial destruction of the Historic District by a mysterious explosion, followed by a viral epidemic that forces federal authorities to seal the only bridge leading to the mainland. A rise in violent crime overwhelms the police, resulting in societal collapse.|$|E
5|$|New {{concepts}} for {{missions to}} the Neptune {{system to be}} conducted in the 2010s have been brought forward by NASA scientists on numerous occasions over the last decades. All of them identified Triton as being a prime target <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> Triton lander comparable to the Huygens probe for Titan was frequently included in those plans. No efforts aimed at Neptune and Triton went beyond the proposal phase and NASA's funding on missions to the outer Solar System is currently focused on the Jupiter and Saturn systems.|$|E

The Denver Post described the organization as a censorship , <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> article from the same newspaper called it a left-of-center politically aligned group, which advocated for both intellectual freedom and artistic freedom.|$|E

5|$|The game {{does not}} include Interplay's extra music, but it {{includes}} the extra level, {{as well as the}} added enemies and hazards from the console versions. This version is part of the Another World 15th Anniversary Edition CD-ROM released in 2007, which also includes a development diary, an exclusive postcard autographed by Chahi <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> soundtrack CD. The CD-ROM version of 15th Anniversary Edition contains strict digital rights management technology– upon installation, the game verifies the user's serial number through the Internet, allowing only for five installations of the game using any given serial number. Uninstallation does not reset the count, so after five installations, the player must purchase a new copy. This problem does not exist on the digital copy sold by GOG.com.|$|E
5|$|The system {{produces}} sound using a Yamaha YM2612 FM synthesizer and a Texas Instruments SN76489 PSG; {{the latter}} is integrated with the Video Display Processor (VDP). The Z80 processor is primarily used to control both sound chips to produce stereo music and sound effects. Most revisions of the original system contain a discrete YM2612 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> YM7101 VDP; the functionality of these two chips was later integrated into a single custom ASIC (FC1004) for the model 2 and later revisions.|$|E
5|$|Work began almost {{immediately}} {{to prepare for}} the expansion of the town. A full master plan was in place by 1949. This envisaged an increase in the population of the town to 50,000, residential properties in nine neighbourhoods radiating from the town centre, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> industrial area to the north. The neighbourhoods would consist mainly of three-bedroom family homes, with a number of smaller and larger properties. Each would be built around a centre with shops, a church, a public house, a primary school and a community centre. Secondary education was to be provided at campuses at Ifield Green, Three Bridges and Tilgate. Later, a fourth campus, in Southgate, was added to the plans.|$|E
