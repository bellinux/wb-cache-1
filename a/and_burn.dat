5|$|After {{the battle}} of Stalingrad in February 1943, Himmler {{realised}} that Germany would likely lose the war, and ordered the formation of Sonderkommando 1005, a special task force under SS-Standartenführer Paul Blobel. The unit's assignment was to visit mass graves on the Eastern Front to exhume bodies <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> them {{in an attempt to}} cover up the genocide. The task remained unfinished {{at the end of the}} war, and many mass graves remain unmarked and unexcavated.|$|E
5|$|All {{projections}} {{of the future of}} the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe must account for the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must increase over time. Stars will eventually exhaust their supply of hydrogen fuel <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> out. Close encounters gravitationally fling planets from their star systems, and star systems from galaxies.|$|E
5|$|In November, Meyszner's area of {{responsibility}} was expanded to include the German occupied territory of Montenegro. The following month, SS-Standartenführer Paul Blobel's Kommando 1005 arrived in Belgrade to dig up <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> {{the bodies of the}} Jewish women and children killed by Meyszner's Gestapo. At the end of 1943, Meyszner was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to being Sivaji Ganesan's 125thfilm, Uyarndha Manithan was conceived as an adaptation of the 1966 Bengali film Uttar Purush. The plot revolves around a wealthy industrialist's son who secretly marries the daughter of his family estate's accountant, only for his father to discover it <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> down the estate along with his son's pregnant wife, who is inside. The remainder of the film reveals the truth behind how she and her progeny survive.|$|E
5|$|In verse 11, {{the text}} makes a {{reference}} to a fragment from section 1.14 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, to metaphorically describe how to gain this knowledge. Making his own soul as the lower fire stick and Om the upper fire stick, states the Kaivalya Upanishad, one must rub these together, light up the fire of knowledge, <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> the ties to ignorance.|$|E
5|$|Like other rare-earth metals, {{lutetium}} {{is regarded}} as having a low degree of toxicity, but its compounds should be handled with care nonetheless: for example, lutetium fluoride inhalation is dangerous and the compound irritates skin. Lutetium nitrate may be dangerous as it may explode <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> once heated. Lutetium oxide powder is toxic as well if inhaled or ingested.|$|E

In September 2008, he made his Broadway debut as Boris Alexeyevich Trigorin in The Seagull. Sarsgaard appeared in the off-Broadway production of Uncle Vanya in January 2009. Sarsgaard is married to actress Maggie Gyllenhaal. They have two daughters.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises are {{threatened}} by deforestation and the wildlife trade, which includes the exotic pet trade, traditional medicine, and bushmeat. Other threats includes road construction, selective logging, and slash <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture. Habitat fragmentation obstructs biological dispersal for these species that rely on vines and lianas to move from tree to tree. Consequently, slow lorises are found dead on power lines or are victims of roadkill in areas where roads cut between forest patches.|$|E
5|$|The temple {{properties}} were {{no longer}} cultivated, and tanks were not maintained. Thus the population was surviving on slash <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture. British colonial policies favored the conversion of these lands into lucrative coconut plantations quickly covering all suitable Pattuva lands. Establishments of large-scale plantations also led to population increase due to migration and settlement of plantation workers from {{the interior of the}} country. This led to a demographic change, and the local Pattuva people became disassociated from the temple and its administration.|$|E

5|$|After a brief {{exchange}} of fire, their crews ran both French ships onshore {{close to the}} mouth of the River Dives, where several of the landing barges that had survived the attack on the British-held Îles Saint-Marcouf were sheltering. Confiante was badly damaged and boarding parties from Hydra and the other ships were able to board <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> her the following morning. Vésuve had suffered less than the Confiante and troops onshore were able to protect her from further attack until her crew could bring her into the nearby harbour of Sallenelles. There she was repaired and eventually she returned to Le Havre.|$|E
5|$|Crawford's {{officers}} held {{a council}} of war. Some argued the abandoned village {{proved that the}} Indians knew about the expedition and were concentrating their forces elsewhere. Others expressed the desire to call off the expedition and return home immediately. Williamson asked for permission to take 50 men <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> the abandoned village, but Crawford refused as he {{did not wish to}} divide his forces. The council decided to continue the march {{for the rest of the}} day, but then to go no further. As the column halted for lunch, John Rose was sent north with a scouting party. Soon, two men returned to report that the scouts were skirmishing with a large force of Indians which was advancing towards the Americans.|$|E
5|$|French {{resistance}} against the Nazi German occupation and the Vichy French puppet government increased drastically {{in the weeks}} leading up to the Dragoon landings. In order to fight the uprising, German units committed numerous atrocities and war crimes against French fighters, as well as civilians, in retaliatory acts. On 9June, after an attack on the German garrison at Tulle, the 2nd SS Panzer Division hanged about 99 civilians while moving towards northern France during the Tulle massacre. The next day, that division murdered 642 civilians in Oradour-sur-Glane during the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre and then proceeded to plunder <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> the town. German units also worked together with French collaborators to subdue partisans, for example against the partisan base at the Vercors massif, but with little lasting result.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, the Rollins Band's record label, Imago Records, {{declared}} itself bankrupt. Rollins began {{focusing on}} his spoken word career. He released Everything, {{a recording of}} a chapter of his book Eye Scream with free jazz backing, in 1996. He continued to appear in various films, including Heat, Johnny Mnemonic and Lost Highway. The Rollins Band signed to Dreamworks Records in 1997 and soon released Come in <b>and</b> <b>Burn,</b> {{but it did not}} receive as much critical acclaim as their previous material. Rollins continued to release spoken-word book readings, releasing Black Coffee Blues in the same year. In 1998, Rollins released Think Tank, his first set of non-book-related spoken material in five years.|$|E
5|$|Khmer Loeu {{typically}} practice subsistence slash <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> {{shifting cultivation}} in small villages of between 20 and 60 nuclear families. Each village collectively owns and governs a forest territory whose boundaries are known though not marked. Within this land, each family is allocated, on average, 1–2hectares (2.5–5acres) of actively cultivated land and 5–6hectares (12.5–15acres) of fallow land. The ecologically sustainable cultivation cycle {{practiced by the}} Khmer Loeu generally lasts 10 to 15 years. Villagers supplement their agricultural livelihood with low-intensity hunting, fishing, and gathering over a large area.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{became aware}} of the {{political}} danger associated with the mass burial of corpses in April 1943, when they discovered the Polish victims of the 1940 Soviet Katyn massacre near occupied Smolensk. The bodies of the 10,000 Polish officers executed by the NKVD were well preserved despite their long burial, clearly attesting to the Soviet mass murder. Subsequently, the secret orders to exhume the corpses buried at Treblinka <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> them came directly from the Nazi leadership, possibly from Himmler, who was very concerned about covering up Nazi crimes. The cremations began shortly after his visit to the camp in late February or early March 1943.|$|E
5|$|The geology in Dwarf Fortress {{is fairly}} accurate. Rocks like olivine or gabbro can be dug up. The topmost layer usually {{consists}} of sand, clay or plain soil—this {{can be used}} for underground farming. Deeper levels will be layers of rock; minerals appear in layers or clusters around the right depth. Gems like tourmalines appear in rare clusters. Water is simulated like falling sand, every space can contain up to seven levels of it. A tile having one level of water is the lowest, while a tile with seven is full. There is a system for simulating temperature and heat. Fires can spread <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> dwarves and furniture. There are four basic seasons in an in-game year: spring, summer, autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|Thorium is {{a highly}} {{reactive}} and electropositive metal. With a standard reduction potential of −1.90V for the Th4+/Th couple, it is somewhat more electropositive than zirconium or aluminium. Finely divided thorium metal can exhibit pyrophoricity, spontaneously igniting in air. When heated in air, thorium turnings ignite <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> with a brilliant white light to produce the dioxide. In bulk, the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow, although corrosion may eventually occur after several months; most thorium samples are contaminated {{with varying degrees of}} the dioxide, which greatly accelerates corrosion. Such samples slowly tarnish in air, becoming grey and finally black at the surface.|$|E
