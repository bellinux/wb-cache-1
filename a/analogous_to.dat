5|$|A viral genome, {{irrespective}} of nucleic acid type, {{is almost always}} either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.|$|E

5|$|Certain solids are {{selenium}}-rich, and selenium can be bioconcentrated by some plants. In soils, selenium {{most often}} occurs in soluble forms such as selenate (<b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> sulfate), which are leached into rivers very easily by runoff. Ocean water contains {{significant amounts of}} selenium.|$|E

30|$|In an <b>analogous</b> way <b>to</b> Corollary 2.3, {{we arrive}} at the {{following}} ‘dual result’.|$|R
5|$|Cheating, where {{either a}} cleaner {{sometimes}} harms its client, or a predatory species mimics a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating is <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> Batesian mimicry, as where a harmless hoverfly mimics a stinging wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse, {{have the same}} colours and patterns, in an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> Mullerian mimicry, as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{expression}} in prokaryotes {{is influenced by}} an RNA-based system similar in some respects to RNAi. Here, RNA-encoding genes control mRNA abundance or translation by producing a complementary RNA that anneals to an mRNA. However these regulatory RNAs are not {{generally considered to be}} <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> miRNAs because the dicer enzyme is not involved. It has been suggested that CRISPR interference systems in prokaryotes are <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> eukaryotic RNA interference systems, although none of the protein components are orthologous.|$|E
5|$|In living systems, {{selenium}} {{is found}} in the amino acids selenomethionine, selenocysteine, and methylselenocysteine. In these compounds, selenium plays a role <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> that of sulfur. Another naturally occurring organoselenium compound is dimethyl selenide.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter's regular {{satellites}} {{are believed}} to have formed from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of accreting gas and solid debris <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> a protoplanetary disk. They may be the remnants of a score of Galilean-mass satellites that formed early in Jupiter's history.|$|E
5|$|One stable N-heterocyclic carbene has a {{structure}} <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> borazine with one boron atom {{replaced by a}} methylene group. This results in a planar 6-electron compound.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computers}} can be roughly classified {{according to the}} level at which the hardware supports parallelism. This classification is broadly <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> the distance between basic computing nodes. These are not mutually exclusive; for example, clusters of symmetric multiprocessors are relatively common.|$|E

5|$|Sharks {{practice}} internal fertilization. The posterior {{part of a}} male shark's pelvic fins are modified {{into a pair of}} intromittent organs called claspers, <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> a mammalian penis, {{of which}} one is used to deliver sperm into the female.|$|E
5|$|The {{amorphous}} form {{of boron}} nitride (a-BN) is non-crystalline, lacking any long-distance regularity in {{the arrangement of}} its atoms. It is <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> amorphous carbon.|$|E
5|$|These {{coverings}} {{have been}} considered as a realistic model {{for the growth of}} quasicrystals: the overlapping decagons are 'quasi-unit cells' <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> the unit cells from which crystals are constructed, and the matching rules maximize the density of certain atomic clusters.|$|E

5|$|This {{reaction}} is {{conducted in the}} oxidising solvent arsenic pentafluoride. The trichloride anion, , has also been characterised; it is <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> triiodide.|$|E
5|$|Thus, the {{ammonium}} ion, , {{plays the}} same role in liquid ammonia as does the hydronium ion in water and the amide ion, , is <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> the hydroxide ion. Ammonium salts behave as acids, and amides behave as bases.|$|E
