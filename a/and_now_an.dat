500|$|Kevin Powell of Rolling Stone felt that, like OutKast's debut album, ATLiens is [...] "a gritty {{document}} of what's happening here <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> <b>an</b> up-to-the-minute briefing on Southern black ghetto life on which OutKast members Andre and Big Boi cast {{their feelings of}} alienation in familiar, realistic characterizations". Powell asserted that unlike East Coast hip hop's [...] "hedonistic materialism" [...] or [...] "the gunplay and pimpism" [...] of West Coast hip hop, [...] "Andre and Big Boi display a unique ability to describe ghetto life while offering up life-affirming possibilities, something all too rare in today's hip-hop nation." [...] Richard Harrington of The Washington Post enjoyed the record's [...] "more serious and focused lyrical sensibility", explaining, [...] "The raps are generally inventive, clever without being cloying, more proof (if any were needed) that hip-hop innovation isn't just an East-West thang." ...|$|E

The film moves back to that time, when a circus came to the town where Sayo and Sota lived. Despite Sota's grandfather warning him not to go near the circus, Sota goes with Sayo. After the performance, they sneak backstage and are caught by the circus clown Haigo, who kindly gives Sota an egg, which he had intended to buy for his grandfather. Sota believes that the clown can read his mind, and calls him Kamisama, which means [...] "god" [...] in Japanese.|$|E
