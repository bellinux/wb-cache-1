5|$|Hari Parbat, {{also known}} as the Mughal fort, is a hill fort on Sharika hill that {{provides}} panoramic views of the Srinagar city and the Dal. It was first established by Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1590. However, he only erected the outer wall of the fort and his plans to build a new capital called Naga Nagor within it did not materialise. The fort in its current state was built much later in 1808 under the reign of Shuja Shah Durrani. Within the fort's precincts are temples, Muslim shrines, and a Sikh Gurudwara. The hill is the subject of many legends in Hindu mythology, and was said to have once been a large sea, inhabited by a demon known as Jalobhava and that the hill grew from <b>a</b> <b>pebble.</b>|$|E

The fish learn that Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece, Darla, who previously killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag. Gill then reveals his plan to escape, jamming the tank's filter with <b>a</b> <b>pebble.</b> The fish would be placed in plastic bags so that the dentist can clean the tank, and then they would roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to jam the filter, but fails, almost getting himself killed in the process. Near the harbor, a pelican, Nigel, flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's adventure. Inspired by his father's determination, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam the filter. Unlike the first attempt, he is able to successfully render the filter useless, but to the tank gang's dismay, the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), {{also called}} the white {{scavenger}} vulture or pharaoh's chicken, is a small Old World vulture and {{the only member of}} the genus Neophron. It is widely distributed; the Egyptian vulture is found from southwestern Europe and northern Africa to India. The contrasting underwing pattern and wedge-shaped tail make it distinctive in flight as it soars in thermals during the warmer parts of the day. Egyptian vultures feed mainly on carrion but are opportunistic and will prey on small mammals, birds, and reptiles. They also feed on the eggs of other birds, breaking larger ones by tossing a large pebble onto them. The use of tools is rare in birds and apart from the use of <b>a</b> <b>pebble</b> as a hammer, Egyptian vultures also use twigs to roll up wool for use in their nest. Egyptian vultures that breed in the temperate regions migrate south in winter while tropical populations are relatively sedentary. Populations of this species have declined in the 20th century and some island populations are endangered by hunting, accidental poisoning, and collision with power lines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In a graph G with <b>a</b> {{distribution}} of <b>pebbles</b> on its vertices, <b>a</b> <b>pebbling</b> move is {{the removal of}} two pebbles from one vertex {{and the addition of}} one <b>pebble</b> to <b>an</b> adjacent vertex. The covering cover pebbling number, denoted by σ (G), of a graph G, is the smallest number of pebbles, such that, however the pebbles are initially placed on the vertices of the graph, after <b>a</b> sequence <b>pebbling</b> moves, the set of vertices with <b>pebbles</b> forms <b>a</b> covering of G.

40|$|For any {{configuration}} of pebbles on the nodes of <b>a</b> graph, <b>a</b> <b>pebbling</b> move replaces two pebbles on one node by one <b>pebble</b> on <b>an</b> adjacent node. <b>A</b> cover <b>pebbling</b> is <b>a</b> move sequence ending with no empty nodes. The number of <b>pebbles</b> needed for <b>a</b> cover <b>pebbling</b> starting with all pebbles on one node is trivial to compute {{and it was}} conjectured that the maximum of these simple cover pebbling numbers is indeed the general cover pebbling number of the graph. That is, for any {{configuration of}} this size, there exists <b>a</b> cover <b>pebbling.</b> In this note, we prove a generalization of the conjecture. All previously published results about cover pebbling numbers for special graphs (trees, hypercubes et cetera) are direct consequences of this theorem. We also prove that the cover <b>pebbling</b> number of <b>a</b> product of two graphs equals {{the product of the}} cover pebbling numbers of the graphs. ...|$|R

Manufacturing a hand axe from a flake is actually easier than from <b>a</b> <b>pebble,</b> it is also quicker as flakes are more likely to be closer to the desired shape. This allows easier manipulation and fewer knaps are required to finish the tool, it is also easier to obtain straight edges. When analysing a hand axe made from a flake it should be remembered that its shape was predetermined (by use of the Levallois technique or Kombewa technique or similar). Notwithstanding this, it is necessary to note tools characteristics: type of flake, heel, knap direction.|$|E

The Giants' catcher, Hank Gowdy, dropped his protective mask to field the ball but, failing to toss the mask aside, stumbled over it and dropped the ball, thus giving Ruel another chance to bat.
