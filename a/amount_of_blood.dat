5|$|In {{the attacks}} of 2007, party leader Morgan Tsvangirai and 49 other {{opposition}} activists were arrested and severely beaten by the police. After his release, Morgan Tsvangirai told the BBC that he suffered head injuries and blows to the arms, knees and back, and that he lost a significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{specific}} {{underlying causes}} {{are treated as}} normally. For example, hemochromatosis is treated by venesection, the regular removal of a fixed <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> Eventually, this decreases the iron levels {{in the body and}} improves the function of the organs in which iron has accumulated.|$|E
5|$|Later, in Boston, Fox Mulder and Dana Scully {{investigate}} {{the disappearance of}} Dr. Craig Horning, an archaeologist from a local history museum, after a security guard discovers a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> in Horning's lab. They interview both the curator, Dr. Lewton, and graduate student Mona Wustner. They also visit a reclusive Bilac. After closing, Lewton is killed by the jaguar spirit after his car doesn't start. During {{an investigation of the}} crime scene, Scully comes across rat corpses in the engine compartment of Lewton's vehicle. Mona denies that anything unusual has happened in the museum.|$|E

5|$|Earlier on I {{tried to}} include people {{as much as}} possible. Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying stuff {{out of my head}} and getting it on to tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about the right <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E
5|$|Ellen {{attempts}} to flee but is severely beaten by the possessed Bruce, who throws {{her around the}} cabin. While being strangled, Ellen picks up Bruce's mutilated hand which is still holding the dagger found from before, and she uses it to stab Bruce. A large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> is expended by Bruce, who lies motionless for a moment, only to then continue his assault on Ellen. Ellen mutilates Bruce's body even further with an axe, chopping off nearly every limb from the writhing body. Severely disturbed by the things she has witnessed, Ellen rocks back and forth muttering to herself. The corpse of Scotty suddenly springs up, before turning towards the oblivious Ellen, ready to attack. The screen then cuts to black, leaving the fate of Ellen ambiguous.|$|E
5|$|The right atrium {{receives}} blood almost continuously {{from the}} body's two major veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. A small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> from the coronary circulation also drains {{into the right}} atrium via the coronary sinus, which is immediately above and {{to the middle of}} the opening of the inferior vena cava. In the wall of the right atrium is an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis, which is a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. Most of the internal surface of the right atrium is smooth, the depression of the fossa ovalis is medial, and the anterior surface has prominent ridges of pectinate muscles, which are also present in the right atrial appendage.|$|E
5000|$|Prolonged bleeding: The dentist has {{a variety}} of means at their {{disposal}} to address bleeding; however, small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> mixed in the saliva after extractions are normal, even up to 72 hours after extraction. Usually, however, bleeding will almost completely stop within eight hours of the surgery, with only minuscule <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> mixed with saliva coming from the wound. A gauze compress will significantly reduce bleeding over a period of a few hours.|$|R
50|$|Loin pain {{hematuria}} syndrome, or LPHS, is {{the combination}} of debilitating unilateral or bilateral flank pain and microscopic or macroscopic <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> in the urine that is otherwise unexplained.|$|R
50|$|Other {{complications}} include leakage of spinal {{fluid and}} wound infection (1%). Most patients will have transient neck pain and stiffness from the surgical incision and from seeding of the spinal fluid with small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b>|$|R
5|$|When airways are damaged, air {{can escape}} {{from them and}} be trapped in the {{surrounding}} tissues in the neck (subcutaneous emphysema) and mediastinum (pneumomediastinum); if it builds up to high enough pressures there, it can compress the airways. Massive air leaks from a ruptured airway can also compromise the circulation by preventing blood from returning to the heart from the head and lower body; this causes a potentially deadly reduction in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> the heart is able to pump out. Blood and other fluids can build up in the airways, and the injury can interfere with the patency of the airway and interfere with its continuity. However, even if the trachea is completely transected, the tissues surrounding it may hold it together enough for adequate air exchange to occur, at least at first.|$|E
5|$|After {{damaging}} {{the instrument panel}} with a medical ointment and decapitating the scientist, who {{turns out to be}} an android, Jim escapes from the laboratory through the sewer. While searching for Sara, Jim trips next to the wheelchair-bound man, suspects and attacks him. After realizing that he caused a scene and doubts the man's involvement, he returns to the room of the woman, where he discovers she has captured Sara, now wearing a Snow White costume. The woman rambles about her time as a character princess and tells him how bad things happen everywhere, including the decapitation at the park. She again hypnotizes Jim with the necklace, but Sara pulls it off and smashes it, freeing Jim from her spell. He returns to his hotel room and puts his family to bed. Jim suffers with digestive distress, vomits up a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> and hairballs, which he recognizes as symptoms of the cat flu and realizes that Sophie infected him. He begins to panic and bleed uncontrollably in the bathroom. Elliot enters and Jim begs him for help, but he closes the door on him.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, Dodge escorted Brady to {{the mouth}} of the Fox River to confer with overall {{commander}} General Henry Atkinson. Dodge left the conference with clear authority from Atkinson to deal with the violence in the mining region. He first traveled to his home fort, at Gratiot's Grove, which he reached on June 13. The Spafford Farm massacre occurred the following day, and Dodge set out for Fort Hamilton as soon as he heard about it, stopping at Fort Blue Mounds for supplies. On the way to Hamilton, the soldiers passed a German immigrant, Henry Apple, exchanged greetings and kept traveling. Shortly afterwards the soldiers heard gunshots in the distance; Apple had met with a Kickapoo ambush, likely meant for Dodge himself. Dodge was probably saved by his last minute decision to make a detour from the main route. Later Apple's horse galloped wildly back past the men, wounded and carrying a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> in its saddle. The horse continued all the way to Fort Hamilton, where it raised a furor among the inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|The {{symptoms}} {{produced by}} AVMs {{in the liver}} depend {{on the type of}} abnormal connection that they form between blood vessels. If the connection is between arteries and veins, a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> bypasses the body's organs, for which the heart compensates by increasing the cardiac output. Eventually congestive cardiac failure develops ("high-output cardiac failure"), with breathlessness and leg swelling among other problems. If the AVM creates a connection between the portal vein and the blood vessels of the liver, the result may be portal hypertension (increased portal vein pressure), in which collateral blood vessels form in the esophagus (esophageal varices), which may bleed violently; furthermore, the increased pressure may give rise to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity (ascites). If the flow in the AVM is in the other direction, portal venous blood flows directly into the veins rather than running through the liver; this may lead to hepatic encephalopathy (confusion due to portal waste products irritating the brain). Rarely, the bile ducts are deprived of blood, leading to severe cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Liver AVMs are detectable in over 70% of people with HHT, but only 10% experience problems as a result.|$|E
25|$|Length {{of surgery}} and <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> lost during surgery were {{significantly}} reduced during supracervical hysterectomy compared to total hysterectomy, {{but there was}} no difference in post-operative transfusion rates.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} versus {{risks of}} placing a nasogastric tube {{in those with}} upper GI bleeding are not determined. Endoscopy within 24hours is recommended. Prokinetic agents such as erythromycin before endocopy can decrease the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> in the stomach and thus improve the operators view. Early endoscopy decreases hospital time and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> transfusions needed. Proton pump inhibitors, if {{they have not been}} started earlier, are recommended in those in whom high risk signs for bleeding are found. It is also recommended that people with high risk signs are kept in hospital for at least 72hours.|$|E
40|$|Aims Wet-cupping as a {{therapeutic}} method has been recommended {{to be done}} on certain days based on authentic sources of traditional medicine in Iran. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relationship between <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> exited <b>blood</b> during wet-cupping with patient’s individual conditions and the time it was performed. Instruments & Methods In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 391 men who were referred to a cupping center in Saveh city in the spring of 2016, were selected by simple sampling and wet-cupping in the position between the two scapula was performed. The research instrument was a questionnaire including demographic characteristics, date of reference (day, month and year), age, height, weight and <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> exited <b>blood</b> during the wet-cupping in gram. Data were analyzed by SPSS 16 software and using chi-square test, paired t test and one-way analysis of variance. Findings The means of age, weight and body mass index were significantly related to the mean <b>of</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> exited <b>blood</b> during wet-cupping (p 0. 05), but the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> exited <b>blood</b> was higher in people with previous history of wet-cupping than those without previous history (p< 0. 001). Also, in people with hypertension, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> exited <b>blood</b> was higher than other treatment groups (p< 0. 05). Conclusion Individual characteristics such as age, weight, body mass index, cause of referral and previous history of wet-cupping affect the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> exited <b>blood</b> during wet-cupping, but the time of wet-cupping (day and month) does not affect the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> exited <b>blood...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The band gained {{attention}} in late 2004 {{after the release}} of the [...] "Under The Boards" [...] music video, which featured large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> and gore. The clip was banned from most TV channels but gained popularity due to internet downloads.|$|R
25|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on September 17, 2013. The Blu-ray disc contains an unrated cut.

25|$|The {{benefits}} versus {{risks of}} placing a nasogastric tube {{in those with}} upper GI bleeding are not determined. Endoscopy within 24hours is recommended, in addition to medical management. A number of endoscopic treatments may be used, including: epinephrine injection, band ligation, sclerotherapy, and fibrin glue depending on what is found. Prokinetic agents such as erythromycin before endocopy can decrease the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> in the stomach and thus improve the operators view. They also decrease the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> transfusions required. Early endoscopy decreases hospital and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> transfusions needed. A second endoscopy within a day is routinely recommended by some but by others only in specific situations. Proton pump inhibitors, if {{they have not been}} started earlier, are recommended in those in whom high risk signs for bleeding are found. High and low dose PPIs appear equivalent at this point. It is also recommended that people with high risk signs are kept in hospital for at least 72hours. Those at low risk of re-bleeding may begin eating typically 24 hours following endoscopy. If other measures fail or are not available, esophageal balloon tamponade may be attempted. While there is a success rate up to 90%, there are some potentially significant complications including aspiration and esophageal perforation.|$|E
25|$|Women were {{instructed}} to prick their finger to draw a small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood,</b> which was placed on a card {{to be sent to}} Acu-Gen to be analyzed for US$250. The kit did not require regulation since it did not diagnose, prevent or treat a disease. The company was not obliged to disclose results of tests.|$|E
50|$|In July 1, 1999, Peeters {{fought in}} Brazilian {{promotion}} World Vale Tudo Championship against Antonio Carlos Ribiero.

50|$|In {{healthy people}} about 0.5 to 1.5 ml <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> escapes blood vessels into the stool each day. Significant <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> can be lost without {{producing}} visible {{blood in the}} stool, estimated as 200 ml in the stomach, 100 ml in the duodenum, and lesser amounts in the lower intestine. Tests for occult blood identify lesser blood loss.|$|R
2500|$|The attackers {{intended}} to strike during peak {{hours on a}} weekday when the subway would be at capacity.

25|$|A {{number of}} other {{symptoms}} may occur from either the bite of the bed bugs or from their exposure. Anaphylaxis from the injection of serum and other nonspecific proteins has been rarely documented. Due to each bite taking a tiny <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood,</b> chronic or severe infestation may lead to anemia. Bacterial skin infection may occur due to skin break down from scratching.|$|E
25|$|As of 2006, {{there were}} about 15 million units of blood {{products}} transfused {{per year in the}} United States. By 2013, the number had declined to about 11 million units, due to the shift towards laparoscopic surgery and other surgical advances and studies that have shown that many transfusions were unnecessary. For example, the standard of care reduced that <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> transfused from 750 to 200ml.|$|E
25|$|The first blood {{transfusion}} from animal to human was administered by Dr. Jean-Baptiste Denys, eminent physician to King LouisXIV of France, on June15, 1667. He transfused {{the blood of}} a sheep into a 15-year-old boy, who survived the transfusion. Denys performed another transfusion into a labourer, who also survived. Both instances were likely due to the small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> that was actually transfused into these people. This allowed them to withstand the allergic reaction.|$|E
