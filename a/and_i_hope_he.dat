500|$|The central {{argument}} in the letter is that the British have negated {{the rights of the}} Irish people by relying on a completely British system to pass the patent without allowing the Irish Parliament a say. William Wood, according to the Drapier, was already involved in a similar dispute with a coin he minted for Massachusetts. Wood, the Drapier claims, [...] "hath already tried his Faculty in New-England, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> will meet with an EQUAL RECEPTION here; what That was I leave to the Publick Intelligence." [...] The response to Wood's coin was a complete boycott of the coin.|$|E
500|$|While {{performing}} at the 1998 KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, Third Eye Blind bassist Arion Salazar ran onstage and [...] "bear-hugged" [...] Dirnt, who was caught off-guard. [...] The incident escalated into an on-stage scuffle before Salazar {{was taken away}} by security. [...] After the performance, Dirnt confronted Salazar backstage, and as the two were arguing, a beer bottle struck Dirnt in the head, causing a small fracture in his skull. [...] Eyewitnesses later attributed the bottle throwing to a fan of Third Eye Blind. [...] Salazar and the band's management soon released a statement: [...] "I am sorry that my attempt at doing something I thought would be funny escalated into Mike getting hurt. That was never my intention. I simply {{had too much to}} drink and made a very bad decision. [...] If I had been in Mike's place, I am sure I would have acted similarly. My heart goes out to him <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> recovers quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor, Willkie offered his full support to Roosevelt. Willkie was {{interested}} in the post of war production czar, but that position went to Donald M. Nelson. Labor Secretary Perkins offered to have Willkie arbitrate between management and labor in war industries, but Willkie declined after White House officials informed the press. In early 1942, Willkie considered a run for Governor of New York. He later stated that Roosevelt had been willing to endorse him, but Willkie ultimately concluded that the Dewey forces were too strong and a defeat might eliminate him from a possible run for president in 1944. In July, Willkie proposed to Roosevelt that he go on another foreign mission, and the following month Willkie announced that he would be visiting the Soviet Union, China, and the Middle East. [...] Dewey wrote, [...] "I hear he is going to Russia before the Republican [...] convention, so he will be where he belongs <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> stays there until Christmas".|$|E

60|$|When I {{perceived}} (which I did, {{almost as}} soon) that jealousy was {{growing out of}} this, I liked this society still better. Had I not been subject to jealousy, and were the endurances to be all mine? No. Let him know what it was! I was delighted that he should know it; I was delighted that he should feel keenly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> did.|$|R
500|$|Cranston's {{performance}} {{was a frequent}} topic in the critiques. Even prior to the airing of the episode, James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly suggested that the actor's voice would be perfect for an animated television series. VanDerWerff and Carp were amongst the journalists who issued favorable assessments of Cranston's acting. Carp noted that [...] "Cranston's work is even more impressive {{when you consider that}} he not only plays the hero and villain but manages to be funny as both." [...] In addressing [...] "Part II", Carp concluded that [...] "as early as the stunning end of the world sequence, the actor plants the hint of suppressed craziness in Spaceman Drake and it was soon obvious that the just crew would not only be manning a mission to help him combat the mutineers but probably get wrapped up in this nut's dream to terra form Mars." [...] For VanDerWerff, [...] "Cranston is the very best kind of guest voice, fully inhabiting his character but also {{having a lot of fun}} with the jokes. It’s a nice reminder of just how funny Cranston can be, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> gets even more bizarre stuff to do next week." [...] Jonah Gardner of Ology later said, [...] "Bryan Cranston remains a god among men." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Boies {{has agreed}} to {{represent}} SCO. I am trying to remind myself that our legal system is predicated on lawyers sometimes representing people they don't personally admire, and the system really does depend on someone being {{willing to take on}} unpopular clients. I know Boies doesn't use email, or at least he didn't the last time I checked. So maybe he doesn't quite get the tech ... ah, hang it all, there's no way around it: I feel bad he's chosen to represent them, especially after I posted an Ode singing his praises, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> loses.|$|E
2500|$|Tasmania toured Zimbabwe {{for five}} games {{ahead of the}} 1995–96 Sheffield Shield. Ponting struggled, {{aggregating}} 99 runs at a modest 24.75. By the end of October, he had {{signed a contract with}} the Australian Cricket Board, along with 22 other Australian cricketers. [...] He opened the batting with Boon in Tasmania's first match of the Sheffield Shield season, scoring 20 and 43. Ahead of the following match against Queensland in Hobart, Ponting set himself a goal of scoring a century in each innings; a feat he achieved in a high-scoring draw. His form continued against the touring Sri Lankans in a one-day game in Devonport, scoring 99. He scored another century against the same opposition in Launceston. During the match, the public address system at the NTCA Ground announced that Ponting was making his Test debut against Sri Lanka in Perth on 8 December. The following morning saw local newspaper The Examiner headline: [...] "He's Ricky Ponting, he's ours ... and he's made it! Tassie's batting star will play in his first Test." [...] Marsh continued his praise of Ponting, who replaced a dropped Blewett. [...] "I have no doubt Ricky will be trying to get 100 in his first Test game. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> does. You'd back him to. If Ricky carries with him the same attitude that he has seen him succeed at First-class cricket to the next level {{there is no reason why}} he will not continue to score." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 24. I {{forgot to}} tell you, that last night I went to Mr. Harley's, hoping--faith, I am blundering, for it was this very night at six; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> would have told me all things were done and granted: but he was abroad, and came home ill, and was gone to bed, much out of order, unless the porter lied. I dined to-day at Sir Matthew Dudley's, with Mr. Addison, etc.|$|R

The pieces had ceased to rattle on the round mahogany table, and every head in the room seemed turned our way, for the Covent Garden story was well known. Chartersea laid {{his hand on the}} back of our fourth chair, greeted us with some ceremony, and said something which, under the circumstances, was almost unheard of in that day: [...] "If you stand in need of one, gentlemen, I should deem it an honour." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Court {{warned the}} {{students}} not to delay contacting their families because the Court {{was going to}} write them promptly. Dean Greenough wrote to Roberts: [...] "The letter that I am sending to your father this morning, although it does not tell him everything, necessitates your telling him everything." [...] To Kenneth Day he wrote: [...] "It {{would be better for}} them to hear it from you than from me." [...] The Dean's letters about students who had committed no overt act explained the circumstances at length and provided he Court's rationale for expulsion in such cases: [...] "The acts in question are so unspeakably gross that the intimates of those who commit these acts become tainted." [...] He made a clear distinction by not criticizing such a student's character, but his judgment, calling him [...] "no worse than ignorant, over-curious, and careless." [...] When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son [...] "has promised to tell you all about the matter, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> will tell you the whole truth. His offense {{has nothing to do with}} low scholarship; it is not gambling, or drink or ordinary sexual intercourse. If he does not confess to something worse than these things, he will not have told you the whole story." ...|$|E

5000|$|George {{wrote in}} one of his last letters to his mother (May 19, 1937), [...] "How is brother Arthur these days? I am glad to hear that he is writing a lot of tunes <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> that <b>he</b> can find a market for some of them." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{seemed to}} look strange at it, <b>and</b> told him <b>I</b> knew {{not what he}} meant; that I had no effects in the Bank of England that <b>I</b> knew of; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> could not say that I had ever told him I had. No, he said, I had not told him so, but his sister had said the {{greatest}} part of my estate lay there. 'And I only mentioned it, me dear,' said he, 'that {{if there was any}} occasion to settle it, or order anything about it, we might not be obliged to the hazard and trouble of another voyage back again'; for he added, that he did not care to venture me too much upon the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] the {{sergeant}} said, [...] "I hear him spoken well of; but I have seen, in other cases, men, {{who have had}} the name of being pleasant and generous, were yet tyrants and brutes in their own family. I judge him as I found him--a hard hearted, tyrannical, vindictive father. I think I had better not see him myself. We have never met. I have never set eyes on him save here in church; but he regarded me as responsible for the folly of his son. He wrote me a violent letter, <b>and</b> said <b>I</b> had inveigled the lad into the marriage; <b>and</b> although <b>I</b> might have {{told him it was}} false, I did not answer his letter, for the mischief was done then, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> would cool down in time.|$|R

6000|$|It {{was a good}} day, {{with only}} one or two drizzles in the morning, and we had not gone far before I found that the Wye was more of a river than I thought it was, though never any bigger than a creek.

[...] The more the boatman talked and made queer jokes, the more I wanted to ask him his name; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> would say David Llewellyn, or at least David, and as a sort of feeler I asked him if he had ever seen a coracle.
