Based on surveys carried out on sixty seamounts 535 species in 130 Families, 29 Orders and 4 Classes are recognized as seamount fishes. Sufficient information for sustainable management such as growth, maturity, fecundity, and diet is available for only 12 (2 %) of the species. Yet 151 (28 %) of the species {{are known to be}} exploited commercially. Most of the species for which data are available are of low or very low productivity and resilience to exploitation. Fitness strategies of seamount fishes are discussed and compared. The number of species in each ecological niche is low on seamounts signifying vulnerability at the ecosystem level. Of the six seamount fishes evaluated {{for the purposes of the}} 2000 IUCN Red List, one was critically endangered, two were vulnerable and three were of lower risk, near-threatened, while other seamount fishes have not yet been assessed. In this study, 62 (12 %) seamount fish species are reported from only one seamount, suggesting a high rate of endemism. WHAT ARE SEAMOUNT FISHES?

40|$|The {{continental}} shelf and upper {{slope of the}} Oregon Cascadia margin are underlain by an elongate late Cenozoic forearc basin, correlative to the Eel River basin of northern California. Basin stratigraphy includes a regional late Miocene unconformity that may coincide with a worldwide hiatus ca. 7. 5 – 6 Ma (NH 6). The unconformity is angular and probably subaerially eroded on the inner and middle shelf, whereas the seaward correlative disconformity may have been produced by submarine erosion; alternatively, this horizon may be conformable. Tectonic uplift resulting in subaerial erosion may have been driven by a change in Pacific and Juan de Fuca plate motion. A structure contour map of the deformed unconformity and correlated seaward reflector from seismic reflection data clearly outlines deformation into major synclines and uplifted submarine banks. Regional margin-parallel variations in uplift rates of the shelf unconformity show agreement with coastal geodetic rates. The shelf basin is bounded to the west by a north-south–trending outer arc high. Rapid uplift and possible eustatic sea-level fall resulted {{in the formation of}} the late Miocene unconformity. Basin subsidence and outer arc high uplift effectively trapped sediments within the basin, which resulted in a relatively starved <b>abyssal</b> <b>floor</b> and narrower Pliocene accretionary wedge, particularly during sea-level highstands. During the Pleistocene, the outer arc high was breached, possibly contributing to Astoria Canyon incision, the primary downslope conduit of Columbia River sediments.

40|$|The Jackfork (~roup in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas is an Upper Mississippian flysch {{succession}} that displays readily distinguishable lithofacies. The frontal Ouachitas {{contain a}} preponderance of disturbed beds which are interbedded with turbidite sandstones. These disturbed and disrupted beds developed {{at the foot of}} a northern unstable slope, the resultant bedding dependent upon the type of material involved, its state of consolidation, and the distance moved. Information gathered concerning the progressive changes from one type of sedimentary structure to another gives a qualitative measure of downslope distance. Muds which undergo submarine deformation upon a sloping sea floor first become flowage shales which change to blocky mudstones with continued failure. Failure of plastic muds and cohesive sandstone progressively form con-torted, chaotic, and. rubble bedding. Deformation of muds and sands form slurried bedding and breecias. Movement of flowing, creeping, or sliding clean sand may have occurred but is not considered to be a type of disruptive bedding. The deformation of mobilized, liquefied sand under some sediment cover produced load structures, audstone dikes, and intrastratal flow structure. The Ouaehita trough possibly consisted of an offsetting series of unstable shale slopes deepening southward to a gentle, west-dipping abyssal plain.

40|$|International audienceRecent marine {{geophysical}} surveys {{reveal the}} existence of well-developed volcaniclastic deep-sea fans around La Réunion Island, Indian Ocean. The Mafate turbidite complex, located in the northwestern part of the island, is a large sedimentary system formed by two coalescent-like volcaniclastic deep-sea fans: the Mafate fan and the Saint-Denis fan. They are both connected to terrestrial rivers supplying sediment produced by erosion on the island, particularly during austral summer cyclonic floods. Through the integration of marine geophysical data (including bathymetry, backscatter multibeam sounder images, TOBI side-scan sonar images and seismic reflection profiles) and piston cores, a submarine morpho-sedimentary map of the surface architecture of the Mafate and Saint-Denis turbidite systems has been established. The systems are divided in three main domains: deep canyons in the proximal area, a channel network in the medial area, and distal depositional lobes on the <b>abyssal</b> sea <b>floor.</b> Two large sediment wave fields also formed {{as a result of}} the volcaniclastic turbidity currents. Three piston cores collected along the Mafate complex provide information on the sedimentary processes in this area over the last 25 ka.

No phylogenetic {{surveys have}} focused on the largest benthic environment on this planet, the abyssal plains. Moreover, knowledge of the spatial patterns of deep-sea community structure is scanty, and what little is known originates primarily from morphology-based studies of foraminiferans. Here we report on the great phylogenetic diversity of microbial eukaryotic communities of all 3 abyssal plains of the southeastern Atlantic Ocean [...] -the Angola, Cape, and Guinea Abyssal Plains [...] -from depths of 5, 000 m. A high percentage of retrieved clones had no close representatives in genetic databases. Many clones were affiliated with parasitic species. Furthermore, differences between the communities of the Cape Abyssal Plain and the other 2 abyssal plains point to environmental gradients apparently shaping community structure at the landscape level. On a regional scale, local species diversity showed much less variation.

40|$|Foraminifera are an {{important}} faunal element of the abyssal ecosystem and largely depend on deposited particulate organic matter from the photic zone to sustain their metabolism for growth and reproduction. However, {{their role in the}} carbon cycle in deep-sea sediments is insufficiently studied. We investigated benthic foraminifera at Station M (4000 m depth) in the Northeast Pacific and assessed the response of individual species to a simulated phytodetritus pulse during an in situ feeding experiment. Sediments were incubated for 4 d with 13 C-labeled diatoms (Thalassiosira weissflogii) applied to the sediment surface. The living foraminiferal community (> 0. 063 mm) of the upper 3 cm contained > 100 species and was strongly dominated by a few taxa of soft-walled saccamminids. Population density of the entire living foraminiferal community was highest at the sediment surface (mean ± SD = 279 ± 72 ind. 10 cm? 3 in background and 13 C-incubated cores) and decreased gradually with depth. Large differences were observed in the uptake of the algal material among species and between depth levels. During the experiment, 0. 82 mg C m? 2 were ingested, mainly by calcareous (~ 60 %) and agglutinated (~ 40 %) foraminifera. Uptake was highest at the sediment surface and 3 to 5 times less in deeper sediment horizons. Despite clear signs of vitality and a strong representation in the foraminiferal community, none of the soft-walled species showed a noticeable response to the offered algal material. We conclude that soft-walled foraminifera may not be important to the short-term phytodetrital matter cycling at the <b>abyssal</b> sea <b>floor...</b>|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. High amplitude reflection packets (HARPs) refer to sheet-like sand deposits, showing high-amplitude seismic-reflection character, which are thought to be associated with constructional channel systems. Based on observations of Quaternary deposits from the Amazon Fan, HARPs are interpreted to be related to channel avulsion events. The depositional model from the Amazon Fan suggests when levees fail, sediment gravity flows move through the break into interchannel lows, where lack of confinement results in sheet like sand deposits. Based on 2 D and 3 D seismic data, HARPs from the Gulf of Mexico not only form from updip channel avulsions, but from additional geological processes. In salt withdrawal minibasins, sediment gravity flows encounter an underfilled depocenter, where lack of confinement results in sheet like deposits. After initial spill into an outboard basin {{and the development of a}} graded slope equilibrium profile, slope channel complexes develop as conduits for sediment transport. These depositional processes characterize the "fill and spill" model and can result in the creation of HARP-like deposits. At the toe-of-the Sigsbee Escarpment, turbidity currents flow through nickpoints at the seaward edge of the escarpment and become unconfined, resulting in HARP-like deposition on the <b>abyssal</b> <b>floor.</b> Seismically, these deposits are laterally continuous, have low relief, pinchout downdip, and have internal channelization. Erosive, low-relief, discontinuous channels and a low-relief, flat-bottomed trough cut into the TS-HARP deposits. On the outer fan, at the seaward limit of submarine channels, sediment gravity flows will also become unconfined and deposit HARPs. These HARPs typically consist of shingled sheet-like deposits that may form larger scale mounded features. These observations indicate that HARP-like deposits can form from a variety of depositional processes and in variable depositional settings along the Gulf of Mexico depositional profile...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The {{processes}} {{responsible for}} transporting and depositing thick sections of coarse-grained terrigenous clastics on the <b>abyssal</b> <b>floor</b> and for forming associated sedimentary structures are still conjectural. Many workers attribute coarse deep-sea sediments and their probable lithified equivalent, the graywackes of flysch deposits to {{some type of}} density movement. Deductions concerning the processes operating in a density flow generally are made from flume studies [...] in which an artificial situation may develop, or from lithified units [...] where the magnitude of post-depositional change is unknown. Both approaches contribute to our knowledge, but the unconsolidated elastics themselves should contain a unique key to understanding the dynamics of abyssal sedimentation. To test this theory, divisions of parallel lamination, found in deep-sea sand and silt, were selected for analysis. Since individual laminae closely approach discrete populations of particles assembled under contrasting conditions, their use carries environmental sampling to its practical limits. Northeast Pacific sediments of late Pleistocene and Holocene age, from deep-sea channel and abyssal plain environments, and representing two or three provenances were studied. A total of 115 light-colored and 84 dark-colored laminae were sampled from eight sequences at five locations. Samples averaged about 0. 8 gram and were quantitatively processed using quarter-phi calibrated sieves and decantation techniques. Statistical evaluation of the procedure shows better than 95 percent sample recovery, and indicates that textural variance between laminae is significantly greater than within-sample variance. The classic concept of density transport [...] that coarsest material is carried by {{the nose of the}} current, and that clastic size grades tail-ward and upward in a uniformly decreasing manner [...] is not substantiated by moment measures, sand-silt-clay percentages or factor analysis of grain-size distributions, at least during deposition of the coarse division of parallel lamination. Coarse abyssal lamination develops within a narrow range of current velocity, the limits of which are defined texturally. Absolute velocity values for these limits can only be related, at the present time, to the few flume or in situ bottom current measurements available. Texture indicates that while the total amount of sand carried in suspension varies, lamination does not begin to form until a current is essentially depleted of all material coarser than fine sand [...] establishing an upper competency limit. At that time, coarse suspended material is distributed throughout the flow mostly in large eddies or vortices whose velocities are estimated on the order of about one meter/sec. Mean current velocity must be sufficient to maintain a dispersed traction carpet without deformation of bedform into ripples. This is postulated at about 50 cm/sec. A current model, based on textural evidence, is proposed to account for lamination. It is suggested that the critical stage in the formation of coarse abyssal lamination occurs while sediment is being dragged along the bottom as bedload. The flowing clastic traction carpet acquires kinetic energy as the current bypasses material lost from suspension. In turn, this energy results in grain shear. When the concentration of granular material in traction is large, it dissipates the energy of bottom shear mostly in collision contacts between gliding grains. The dispersive stresses developed tend to maintain grain separation and prevent settling. Eventually, turbulence in seawater entrapped between grains is suppressed and the net path of grans impelled by repeated collisions becomes quasi-laminar. Within this quasi-laminar traction system, dispersive pressure causes some migration of finer sizes toward the base of the carpet and a concentration of coarser grains in the upper bedload. As new material is introduced in large quantities from suspension, the zone of internal shear [...] the base of the moving carpet [...] is displaced progressively upward. As it passes, sediment compacts to a fraction of its dispersed thickness and a population of grains with a slightly finer size distribution than the carpet load comes to rest. This is buried by new deposition and a densely-packed, dark layer continues to accrete upward as long as a moving traction carpet is sustained and a dense rain of clastics is contributed from suspension. When a sand-laden eddy impinges on the bottom, it releases its coarsest load into traction and the dark layer then accreting increases significantly in grains larger than 44 microns. Any eddy, whether laden or not, on striking bottom adds to, or deducts its velocity from the velocity of the traction carpet and either increases or decreases bottom shear. Additional impulse given to tractive shear by eddies merely results in more effective size sorting. However, an eddy whose velocity of rotation is opposed to current movement may reduce shear below the critical necessary to maintain a thick carpet by dispersive pressure, The dispersed carpet collapses and instantaneously ceases moving. This less-densely packed layer has a slightly higher sand content than the accreted material below. When partially dried or weathered, alternate layers exhibit different moisture retention properties [...] the less-porous, accreted layers appearing dark and the more loosely packed layers appearing light...|$|E

Our motivation is to develop a methodology for reconstructing ocean bathymetry in the geologic past that includes heterogeneous continental margins in addition to <b>abyssal</b> ocean <b>floor.</b> First, the plate cooling model is applied to maps of ocean crustal age to calculate depth to basement. To the depth to basement we add an isostatically adjusted, multicomponent sediment layer constrained by sediment thickness in the modern oceans and marginal seas. A three-parameter continental shelf-slope-rise structure completes the bathymetry reconstruction, extending from the ocean crust to the coastlines. Parameters of the shelf-slope-rise structures at active and passive margins are determined from modern ocean bathymetry at locations where a complete history of seafloor spreading is preserved. This includes the coastal regions of the North, South, and central Atlantic, the Southern Ocean between Australia and Antarctica, and the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of South America. The final products are global maps at 0. 1 ° × 0. 1 ° resolution of depth to basement, ocean bathymetry with an isostatically adjusted multicomponent sediment layer, and ocean bathymetry with reconstructed continental shelf-slope-rise structures. Our reconstructed bathymetry agrees with the measured ETOPO 1 bathymetry at most passive margins, including the east coast of North America, north coast of the Arabian Sea, and northeast and southeast coasts of South America. There is disagreement at margins with anomalous continental shelf-slope-rise structures, such as around the Arctic Ocean, the Falkland Islands, and Indonesia...|$|R

Isotopic labels penetrated to 5 cm sediment depth, with no differences between stations or experimental treatments (substrate or time). Macrofaunal assemblage structure differed between the eastern and western canyon branches. Following deposition of marine phytodetritus, no changes in macrofaunal feeding activity were observed between the eastern and western branches, with little change {{between 3 and 7}} days. Macrofaunal C and N uptake was substantially lower following deposition of terrigenous phytodetritus with feeding activity governed by a strong N demand. Bacterial C uptake was greatest, in the western branch of the Whittard canyon, but feeding activity decreased between 3 and 7 days. Bacterial processing of marine and terrigenous OM were similar to the macrofauna in surficial (0 – 1 cm) sediments. However, in deeper sediments bacteria utilised greater proportions of terrigenous OM. Bacterial biomass decreased following phytodetritus deposition and was negatively correlated to macrofaunal feeding activity. Consequently, this study suggests that macrofaunal-bacterial interactions influence benthic C cycling in the Whittard canyon, resulting in differential fates for marine and terrigenous OM...|$|R

The former is called Nikoro Group and the latter Saroma and Yubetsu Groups. The Nikoro Group is separately distributed forming two masses called the Eastern and the Western masses. The geologic constitutions of the two masses have been studied and the following distinct contrasts between them were revealed: The Western mass is characterized by the presence of abundant hyaloclastites and pillow lavas which are alkalibasalt or trachyte. Limestones associated with chert are rather common in the mass. Strata-bound Mn-oxide ores and massive sulfide ore deposits both in a small scale are found here. On the other hand, the Eastern mass is characterized by the preponderant occurrence of pillow lavas of tholeiitic basalt. It is noteworthy that manganiferous hematite deposits predominate in the Eastern mass, especially in the northern part. Hyaloclastites and limestones are poorer here. REE abundances of pillow lavas and related rocks from the two masses were examined. The results obtained show that the pillow lavas from the Eastern mass is the solid type whereas those from the Western mass the liquid type. Gabbro and troctolite believed to be of tectonic blocks are found in the northern Tokoro Belt though the quantity is scant.

40|$|Aim The aim of {{this work}} was to improve {{understanding}} about the mode, geography and tempo of diversification in deep-sea organisms, using a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of the heterobranch gastropod genus Scaphander. Location Atlantic and Indo-West Pacific (IWP) oceans. Methods Two mitochondrial gene markers (COI and 16 S) and one nuclear ribosomal gene (28 S) from six Atlantic species of Scaphander, and four IWP species were used to generate a multilocus phylogenetic hypothesis using uncorrelated relaxed-clock Bayesian methods implemented in beast and calibrated with the first occurrence of Scaphander in the fossil record (58. 7 – 55. 8 Ma). Results Two main clades were supported: clade A, with sister relationships between species and subclades from the Atlantic and IWP; and clade B, with two western Atlantic sister species. Our estimates indicate that the two earliest divergences in clade A occurred between the middle Eocene and late Miocene {{and the most recent}} speciation occurred within the middle Miocene to Pleistocene. The divergence between the two western Atlantic species in clade B was estimated at late Oligocene–Pliocene. Main conclusions The prevailing mode of speciation in Scaphander was allopatric, but one possible case of sympatric speciation was detected between two western Atlantic species. Sister relationships between IWP and Atlantic lineages suggest the occurrence both of vicariance events caused by the closure of the Tethyan Seaway and of dispersal between the two ocean basins, probably around South Africa during episodic disruptions of the deep-sea regional current system caused by glacial–interglacial cycles. Cladogenetic estimates do not support comparatively older diversification of deep-sea faunas, but corroborate the hypothesis of a pulse of diversification centred in the Oligocene and Miocene epochs. Amphi-Atlantic species were found to occur at deeper depths (bathyal–abyssal) and we hypothesize that trans-Atlantic connectivity is maintained by dispersal between neighbouring reproductive populations inhabiting the <b>abyssal</b> sea <b>floor</b> and by dispersal across the shelf and slope of Arctic and sub-Arctic regions...|$|R
40|$|As {{anthropogenic}} activities {{expand into}} the deep sea, it is only recently {{that the importance of}} deep-sea ecosystems and processes to global biogeochemical systems has become clear. If the potential impact of human activity upon deep-sea organisms and ecosystems is to be understood and predicted, experimental studies are required to improve our knowledge of their sensitivity to contamination and disturbance. Echinoderms are integral components of deep-sea benthic communities and, by virtue of their abundance, they contribute significantly to deep-sea biogeochemical processes. As such, echinoderms can be considered relevant target organisms for deep-sea experimental studies. Three approaches to the investigation of deep-sea anthropogenic impact upon echinoderms were undertaken in this study. The first was based on contaminant exposure experiments with two species of shallow-water echinoid, the eurytopic Psammechinus miliaris and the stenotopic Brissopsis lyrifera. A range of biomarkers was used to assess the responses of the echinoids to contaminant exposure. Compared with the significant cytological and molecular (assess via qPCR) responses in P. miliaris, a reduced capacity to respond to contaminant exposure was found in B. lyrifera at these levels of biological organisation. Stenotopic species are hence recommended for future experimental studies as proxies for deep-sea echinoderms which, due to their adaptation to the stable environment of the deep sea, are also considered to have a reduced capacity for homeostasis in the face of environmental perturbation. The second experimental approach involved sediment burial experiments, simulating anthropogenic drilling disturbance, with the deep-water echinoderm species Echinus acutus. ROV technology was used to perform the burial experiments in situ at 114 m depth. The application of quantitative PCR molecular biomarker methodology revealed {{a significant increase in the}} expression of a stress- 70 protein in response to sediment burial. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of the qPCR technique to assess an organism’s stress-response, and its relevance to deep-sea experimental studies. Finally, the development and successful deployment of an in situ respirometer, the benthic incubation chamber system (BICS) 2, made possible the acquisition of physiological measurements from deep-sea echinoderms at the <b>abyssal</b> sea <b>floor</b> at 3500 m. The results revealed similarities between the oxygen consumption rates of shallow-water and deep-sea echinoderms. The future performance of in situ deep-sea experimentation is dependent on the development of experimental equipment that confers the ability to perform experiments in situ with ROV technology and to obtain results without interference from recovery-related side effects.

5000|$|The {{amount of}} carbon tied up in a typical single whale carcass (about two metric tons of carbon for a typical forty-ton carcass) is roughly {{equivalent}} to the {{amount of carbon}} exported to a hectare of <b>abyssal</b> ocean <b>floor</b> in 100-200 years. [...] This amount of organic material reaching the seafloor at one time creates a pulse equivalent to about 2000 years of background carbon flux in the 50 square metres of sediment immediately beneath the whale fall. [...] This helps to sustain the community structure that develops around a whale fall, but it also has potential implications for the biological pump, or the flux of organic material from the surface ocean to depth. Whales and some other large marine animals feed on and follow large aggregations of zooplankton for sustenance. Based on simple trophic structure, this would mean whales and other large zooplankton feeders can be found at higher abundance around areas of high primary production, potentially making them important exporters of carbon to depth through food falls. (Higgs et al., 2014). Biological pump models indicate that a large amount of carbon uptake by the deep sea is not supplied by particulate organic carbon (POC) alone, and must come from another source. Lateral advection of carbon, especially in coastal areas contributes to this deficit in the model, but food falls are also another source of organic carbon for the deep ocean (Higgs et al., 2014). Various percentages of the food fall contribution to the total carbon flux to the deep ocean have been hypothesized, ranging from 0.3% (Smith 2006) to 4% (Higgs et al., 2014). There is growing evidence that the contribution of food falls to the deep ocean carbon flux is larger than originally proposed, especially on the local scale in areas of high primary productivity. Unfortunately, contributions of food falls to the biological pump are hard to measure and rely on a few serendipitous studies on discovered falls (Smith et al., 1989; Higgs et al., 2014) as well as planted carcasses (Janssen et al., 2000; Kemp et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2009), with much of the deep sea carbon flux studies relying on sediment traps (Robison et al., 2005; Miller and Wheeler, 2012). One study even suggested that the whaling industry has had an effect on the biological pump through the elimination of many large whales, as well as a large number of whales, reducing the amount of whale falls (Pershing et al., 2010).|$|R
40|$|We use an {{absolute}} and relative plate motion {{model for the}} plates around Australia to identify major plate tectonic events, evaluate their causes, and investigate their effects on anomalous intraplate subsidence or uplift and {{on the history of}} oceanic crustal accretion. An event at 136 Ma is marked by the onset of sea floor spreading between Greater India and Australia. At about this time long-lived subduction east of Australia ceased, probably due to subduction of the Phoenix-Pacific spreading ridge, changing this plate boundary to a transform margin. Between 130 and 80 Ma, Australia and East Antarctica moved eastward in the Atlantic-Indian mantle hotspot reference frame. This can be plausibly linked to ridge push from the NW -SE oriented spreading center NW of Australia and to the inferred geometry and continued subduction of the Phoenix plate beneath the West Antarctic margin. A drastic change in spreading direction between the Indian and Australian plates from NE-SW to N-S occurred at about 99 Ma, possibly caused by a change in absolute motion of the Pacific Plate. Chron 27 (61 Ma) marks the onset of relative motion between East and West Antarctica, and a change in the relative motion between Australia and Antarctica. It may be linked to the subduction of a segment of the Neo-Tethyan Ridge. Both events caused anomalous subsidence on the Northwest Shelf of Australia. The almost stationary position of Australia w. r. t. the mantle from - 80 Ma to - 40 Ma may reflect the progressive subduction of the Pacific-Phoenix ridge to the east of New Zealand preceding 80 Ma, resulting in a diminished trench suction force east of Australia. Preliminary reconstructions to close the Pacific-Australian plate circuit based on recently collected geophysical data indicate that a tectonic event at 43 Ma may mark the onset of renewed subduction east of Australia. At the same time spreading in the Wharton Basin between India and Australia ceased, and tectonic reactivation is recorded in the Bass Strait. Excess late Tertiary subsidence on the northwest shelf of > 500 m matches the anomalous depth of the Argo <b>abyssal</b> plain ocean <b>floor.</b> This anomalous subsidence may express largescale intraplate deformation in the Indian Ocean. Asymmetries in oceanic crustal accretion around Australia are caused mainly by hotspot-ridge and coldspot-ridge interaction...|$|R
