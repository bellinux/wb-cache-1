Van Doren, Oil Merchant and Stearin Candle Manufacturer, known as a seller of whale oil, at 34 New Street in Manhattan, and spread quickly to {{adjoining}} buildings. The City Hall <b>alarm</b> <b>bell</b> began to ring at about 3:00 a.m., summoning firefighters.|$|E
25|$|In the fall, Polly's husband Dick {{moved back}} home. His parents {{supplied}} a small living allowance and Dick, Polly, {{and the two}} children moved into a three-story tenement building. Crosby lived with his father while Dick continued his studies at Harvard. While Dick worked at the bank, Harry Crosby sent crates of flowers from his mother's garden to Polly's apartment and brought over toys for the children. They drove to the shore together. Dick volunteered to join the fire department and persuaded the fire chief to wire a fire <b>alarm</b> <b>bell</b> to his home, so he could turn out at any hour. The fire chief soon let Dick go, and Dick retreated into drink again.|$|E
25|$|It {{was then}} that he joined the All-England Eleven, playing his first game for them at Newark-on-Trent. This meant Caesar would now tour the country, playing cricket, and {{receiving}} somewhere between £4 and £6 from Clarke, from which he {{would also have to}} pay his expenses. Caesar's form dropped, which would have made him more anxious about his place, and he got up to some strange antics at hotels. He became irrationally nervous fearing that someone may have died in his bed, or that the hotel would burn down. One time, after yells from a drunkard outside, Caesar convinced himself that there was a fire and rang the <b>alarm</b> <b>bell,</b> causing minor panic amongst the other guests.|$|E

500|$|After {{the village}} was incorporated, the company petitioned the village board to form the company into a village fire department. Their request was granted on February 10, 1903. In 1906, the village counsel advised reorganization, and the Briarcliff Fire Company {{was created in the}} office of Walter Law, with Messinger again serving as Foreman. The fire equipment, totaling $55.93 ($ in [...] ), was {{transferred}} to the new company. In 1908, American LaFrance sold a hook-and-ladder truck and two-wheeled hose-and-chemical truck (both horse-drawn) to the fire department for $2,700 ($ in [...] ). In the following year an <b>alarm</b> <b>bell</b> was purchased, replacing first a suspended railway iron and sledgehammer in a barn, which was followed by an ineffective steam whistle.|$|E

"While the law recognizes {{and gives}} us the right to ride in such conveyances," [...] the {{editorial}} continued, [...] "there are {{a certain number of}} the employees of this Company, who, if a colored person attempts to cross the street while their car is passing, are seized with a sudden fit of Negrophobia, which is generally manifested by pulling their <b>alarm</b> <b>bell</b> violently, as if some danger was imminent, so afraid are they that some other of our respectable females might attempt to exercise the right that Miss Brown has just won.

2500|$|The city {{responded to}} the strike by ringing the city's <b>alarm</b> <b>bell</b> {{for the first time}} in its history; the Mayor ordered a company of the local militia to patrol the streets. The strikers responded with mass picketing. When mill owners turned fire hoses on the picketers {{gathered}} in front of the mills, they responded by throwing ice at the plants, breaking a number of windows. The court sentenced 24 workers to a year in jail for throwing ice; as the judge stated, [...] "The only way we can teach them is to deal out the severest sentences". Governor Eugene Foss then ordered out the state militia and state police. Mass arrests followed.|$|E

30|$|The <b>alarm</b> <b>bells</b> are ringing loudly, {{but will}} they be heard? As John Donne 1 asked in 1624, “Perchance he for whom this bell tolls may be so ill, as that he knows not it tolls for him?” (1624, p. 108). Will the science {{education}} community take heed of the <b>alarm</b> <b>bells</b> and mobilize new forms of action? It seems as if those who are alert are already acting decisively (Mueller and Tippins 2015) – {{but they are a}} small minority. The mainstream seems pre-occupied with business as usual. For whom does the bell toll? Science educators should ask, for I fear it tolls for them.|$|R

2500|$|At this point, the {{emphasis}} on military campaigns that Makhno had adopted {{in the previous year}} shifted to political concerns. The first Congress of the Confederation of Anarchists Groups, under the name of Nabat ("the <b>Alarm</b> <b>Bell</b> Toll"), issued five main principles: rejection of all political parties, rejection of all forms of dictatorships (including the dictatorship of the proletariat, viewed by Makhnovists and many anarchists of the day as a term synonymous with the dictatorship of the Bolshevik communist party), negation of any concept of a central state, rejection of a so-called [...] "transitional period" [...] necessitating a temporary dictatorship of the proletariat, and self-management of all workers through free local workers' councils (soviets). While the Bolsheviks argued that their concept of dictatorship of the proletariat meant precisely [...] "rule by workers' councils," [...] the Makhnovist platform opposed the [...] "temporary" [...] Bolshevik measure of [...] "party dictatorship." [...] The Nabat was by no means a puppet of Makhno and his supporters, from time to time criticizing the Black Army and its conduct in the war.|$|E
2500|$|The novel/classic {{is set in}} {{the reign}} of [...] "old King Henry VI" [...] (1422–1461, 1470–1471) and during the Wars of the Roses (1455–1487). The story begins with the Tunstall Moat House <b>alarm</b> <b>bell,</b> rung to summon {{recruits}} for its absent lord Sir Daniel Brackley, to join the Battle of Risingham; at which the outlaw [...] "fellowship" [...] known as [...] "the Black Arrow" [...] begins to strike with its [...] "four black arrows" [...] for the [...] "four black hearts" [...] of Brackley and three of his retainers: Nicholas Appleyard, Bennet Hatch, and Sir Oliver Oates, the parson. The rhyme posted in explanation of this attack, makes the protagonist Richard ('Dick') Shelton, ward of Sir Daniel, curious about {{the death of his father}} Sir Harry Shelton. Having been dispatched to Kettley, where Sir Daniel was quartered, and sent to Tunstall Moat House by return dispatch, he falls in with a fugitive, Joanna Sedley, disguised as a boy with the alias of John Matcham: an heiress kidnapped by Sir Daniel to obtain guardianship over her and to retain his control over Richard by marrying her to him.|$|E

2500|$|QI (Quite Interesting) is a British comedy panel game {{television}} {{quiz show}} created and co-produced by John Lloyd, and features permanent panelist Alan Davies. Stephen Fry was {{host of the}} show from its initial pilot, before departing after the final episode of the M series in 2015, with frequent QI panelist Sandi Toksvig replacing him prior {{to the beginning of}} the N series in 2016. The format of the show focuses on Davies and three other guest panelists answering questions that are extremely obscure, making it unlikely that the correct answer will be given. To compensate, the panelists are awarded points not only for the right answer, but also for interesting ones, regardless of whether they are right or even relate to the original question, while points are deducted for [...] "answers which are not only wrong, but pathetically obvious" [...] – typically answers that are generally believed to be true but in fact are misconceptions. These answers, referred to as [...] "forfeits", are usually indicated by a loud klaxon and <b>alarm</b> <b>bell,</b> flashing lights, and the incorrect answer being flashed on the video screens behind the panelists. Bonus points are sometimes awarded or deducted for challenges or incorrect references, varying from show to show. QI has a philosophy that [...] "everything is interesting if looked at in the right way"; many factual errors in the show have been corrected in later episodes or on the show's blog.|$|E
