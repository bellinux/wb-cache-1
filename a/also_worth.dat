5|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>worth</b> {{mentioning}} that sea shells, after collecting, {{need to be}} washed thoroughly in freshwater to remove the salt that is on and in the shell, and then dried thoroughly before they are stored. Salt attracts moisture and makes shells more vulnerable to Bynesian decay.|$|E
5|$|Generally, Republicans are {{strongest in}} the suburbs of Oklahoma City and Tulsa, as well as the Panhandle. Democrats are strongest {{in the eastern part of}} the state and Little Dixie, as well as the most heavily African American and inner parts of Oklahoma City and Tulsa. With a {{population}} of 8.6% Native American in the state, it is <b>also</b> <b>worth</b> noting most Native American precincts vote Democratic in margins exceeded only by African Americans.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>worth</b> {{noticing that}} in the early 16th century one of the houses which predated the palace hosted an osteria. In the late 1510s Raphael, at that time {{painting}} the Vatican loggias, often had lunch together with his aides in a rear room of that eatery. The artists often discussed work problems during lunch, sketching different solutions {{on the walls of the}} room. When the palace was built, the osteria remained in place, and the owners always took care of the walls of that room throughout the years.|$|E
50|$|Mausinsel ("Mouse island", <b>also</b> called <b>Wörth)</b> is {{an island}} in the Wörthsee lake in Bavaria. It {{contains}} the Wörthschlössl, a castle.|$|R

5|$|Part of the {{conflict}} between Team Bondi and Rockstar was due to Rockstar's frustration with Team Bondi's direction, and eventually Team Bondi's management in turn resented Rockstar for taking lots of creative control. It's <b>also</b> <b>worth</b> pointing out that Rockstar used to be very keen on making Team Bondi something like 'Rockstar Sydney' - the more they worked with Team Bondi management, the more they {{came to understand that}} this was a terrible idea.|$|E
5|$|There remains some {{uncertainty}} {{whether the}} source test or nature test {{ought to be}} the determining test. It appears, though, that the impact of Datafin remains qualified in the light of other decisions where the source of the power was held to be the determining factor. It is <b>also</b> <b>worth</b> noting that the effect of the nature test is greatly restricted in practice due to the insistence on the difference between contractual and governmental powers. Where there is a contractual relationship between an aggrieved person and the body making a decision affecting the person, this tends to place the dispute on the private law side of the public–private divide, making the decision not amenable to judicial review.|$|E
5|$|Like the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, Salamis {{has gained}} {{something}} of a 'legendary' status (unlike, for instance, the more decisive Battle of Plataea), {{perhaps because of the}} desperate circumstances and the unlikely odds. A significant number of historians have stated that Salamis {{is one of the most}} significant battles in human history (though the same is often stated of Marathon). In a more extreme form of this argument, some historians argue that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis, the ensuing conquest of Greece by the Persians would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as we know it. This view is based on the premise that much of modern Western society, such as philosophy, science, personal freedom and democracy are rooted in the legacy of Ancient Greece. Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the domination of much of modern history by Western Civilization, Persian domination of Greece might have changed the whole trajectory of human history. It is <b>also</b> <b>worth</b> mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential Athenian culture occurred only after the Persian wars were won.|$|E

25|$|<b>Also</b> <b>worth</b> {{mentioning}} is Marc Buhl's {{novel of}} 2002, Der rote Domino ("The Red Domino"), which uses the friendship between Goethe and Lenz, and its abrupt end, as {{the inspiration for}} a detective story.|$|E
25|$|Classical {{learning}} would by {{no means}} replace the role of scripture within the monastery; {{it was intended to}} augment the education already under way. It is <b>also</b> <b>worth</b> noting that all Greek and Roman works were heavily screened to ensure only proper exposure to text, fitting {{with the rest of the}} structured learning.|$|E
25|$|The stadium {{has also}} hosted NCAA tournament soccer and {{lacrosse}} games, including the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship games in 1998, 2001, and 2002. It is <b>also</b> <b>worth</b> noting that, prior to 1994, the original Rutgers Stadium hosted the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship games in 1974, 1978, 1983, 1987, and 1990.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>worth</b> {{noting that}} the {{relative}} rates for the formation reactions in the table above are the same for a given reaction at both temperatures. This {{is due to the}} reaction rate constants for these reactions having β and γ constants of 0, resulting in k=α which is independent of temperature.|$|E
25|$|Right at the Nassau castle's gateway arch building, {{standing}} over König-Adolf-Platz, is the Town Hall (Rathaus) from 1698, {{in a rather}} odd way over the passage that separates the Old Town from the castle. <b>Also</b> <b>worth</b> mentioning is the carillon (Glockenspiel). A rockslide from the crags destroyed the Town Hall in 1928, but it was rebuilt between 1932 and 1934.|$|E
25|$|The Bulls' {{television}} broadcasts {{are split}} among NBC Sports Chicago, which broadcasts {{most of the}} games, WGN-TV, and WCIU-TV. The announcers are Neil Funk and Stacey King. <b>Also</b> <b>worth</b> noting is that WGN-TV does not air all of its Chicago Bulls games nationwide: only a select few, usually Saturday games, were nationally televised on WGN America from 1999–2014. The rest are only available within the Chicago area.|$|E
50|$|During Egozcue Cintrón's various {{terms as}} mayor an urban police corps {{was created to}} patrol the city. <b>Also,</b> $600,000 <b>worth</b> of {{municipal}} bonds were issued, resulting in full payment of city debt and the completion of an aqueduct.|$|R

25|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>worth</b> {{comparing}} {{the details of}} the Iliadic story to those of older Mesopotamian literature—most notably, the Epic of Gilgamesh. Names, set scenes, and even major parts of the story, are strikingly similar. Some academics believe that writing first came to Greece from the east, via traders, and these older poems were used to demonstrate the uses of writing, thus heavily influencing early Greek literature.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>worth</b> {{noting that}} innumerable clandestine combatants survived {{the war as}} part of a couple, and that their Resistance {{participation}} would have been impossible or insurvivable without the support of their companion at their side: Cécile and Henri Rol-Tanguy, Raymond and Lucie Aubrac, Paulette and Maurice Kriegel-Valrimont, Hélène and Philippe Viannay, Marie-Hélène and Pierre Lefaucheux, Cletta and Daniel Mayer, and many others were inseparable.|$|E
25|$|Fifteen {{stations}} of the Washington Metro subway system are located in Prince George’s County, with four of them as terminus stations: Greenbelt, New Carrollton, Largo, and Branch Avenue.
