Robert {{had no intention of}} peace; he sent his son Bohemond with an <b>advance</b> <b>force</b> towards Greece and Bohemond landed at Aulon, with Robert following shortly after.|$|E
5|$|In April 1552 an Ottoman {{fleet of}} twenty four galleys and four supply ships under Piri Reis left Suez {{en route to}} Hormuz, aiming to {{eliminate}} Portuguese presence in the region. An <b>advance</b> <b>force</b> landed at Muscat in July 1552. After an eighteen-day siege of Muscat the town fell and the fort was destroyed. The commander, João de Lisboa, and 128 Portuguese were taken captive. The main Ottoman fleet arrived, and the combined fleet went on to Hormuz.|$|E
5|$|Despite these reverses, {{in early}} 1261, Emperor Michael VIII {{set his sights}} on {{capturing}} the great prize: Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, which had been the seat of the Latin Empire since its capture by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. To this end, Michael concluded an alliance with Genoa in March, and in July 1261, as the one-year truce concluded after the previous failed Nicaean attack was nearing its end, Strategopoulos, recently released from Epirote custody, was sent with a small <b>advance</b> <b>force</b> of 800 soldiers (most of them Cumans) to keep a watch on the Bulgarians and spy out the defences of the Latins.|$|E

In addition to physical conditioning, the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Forces</b> learn hand-to-hand combat, survival techniques, military tactics, map reading and radio transmission. Followed by a 4 weeks wildlife management course and wildlife capturing course. Mutation to SFR is possible after five years experience as an AFR.|$|R

5|$|Even though racial {{politics}} often {{resulted in}} the company receiving untrained replacements, it performed well in many small-scale engagements during this time. In the summer of 1951, the company was employed along the front line as an <b>advance</b> <b>force</b> to push back Chinese attacks as the front lines became more static. The company was highly regarded for its actions capturing and holding Hill 581 during the Battle of the Soyang River, in which the company inflicted hundreds of casualties on the Chinese without a single Ranger being killed.|$|E
5|$|In {{each of its}} iterations, {{the brigade}} was not {{organized}} as a permanent formation. Typically it was created only as a temporary front-line unit while larger United States Marine units were formed. The brigade would then merge with these to form a Marine division. The 1942 brigade merged with the 2nd Marine Division, the 1944 brigade {{was the basis for}} the formation of the new 6th Marine Division, and the 1950 brigade acted as an <b>advance</b> <b>force</b> for the newly reactivated 1st Marine Division before merging into that unit.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{turn left}} towards Concord, Marine Lieutenant Jesse Adair, {{at the head}} of the advance guard, decided on his own to protect the flank of the British column by first turning right and then leading the {{companies}} onto the Common itself, in a confused effort to surround and disarm the militia. Major Pitcairn arrived from the rear of the <b>advance</b> <b>force</b> and led his three companies to the left and halted them. The remaining companies under Colonel Smith lay further down the road toward Boston.|$|E

5|$|The British army {{began an}} unopposed landing {{at the north}} end of Lake George on the morning of July 6. Abercrombie first landed an <b>advance</b> <b>force</b> to check the area where the forces were to disembark, and found it {{recently}} deserted; some supplies and equipment had been left behind by the French in their hasty departure. The bulk of the army landed, formed into columns, and attempted to march up the west side of the stream that connected Lake George to Lake Champlain, rather than along the portage trail, whose bridges Montcalm had destroyed. However, the wood was very thick, and the columns could not be maintained.|$|E
5|$|Once the Elector and his co-commander, Marshal Marsin, {{knew of the}} Allies' objective, they {{dispatched}} Count d'Arco with an <b>advance</b> <b>force</b> of 12,000 {{men from}} their main camp at Dillingen to strengthen and hold the Schellenberg heights above the town. Rejecting a protracted siege, Marlborough decided in favour of a quick assault, before the position could be made impregnable. After two failed attempts to storm the barricades, the Allied commanders, acting in unison, finally managed to overwhelm the defenders. It had taken just two hours to secure the bridgehead over the river in a hard fought contest, but following the victory, momentum was lost to indecision. The deliberate devastation of the Elector's lands in Bavaria failed to bring Max Emanuel to battle or persuade {{him back into the}} Imperial fold. Only when Marshal Tallard arrived with reinforcements to strengthen the Elector's forces, and Prince Eugene of Savoy arrived from the Rhine to bolster the Allies, was the stage finally set for the decisive action at the Battle of Blenheim the following month.|$|E
5|$|With the ROK army in retreat, the 766th Regiment, 549th Unit, and KPA's 5th Divisions all {{advanced}} steadily {{south along}} the eastern roads without encountering much resistance. Across the entire front the North Korean Army had successfully routed the South Koreans and was pushing them south. The 766th Regiment acted as an <b>advance</b> <b>force,</b> attempting to infiltrate further inland as it moved through the mountainous eastern region of the country. The rugged terrain of the eastern regions of Korea, poor communication equipment, and unreliable resupply lines thwarted the South Korean resistance. The North Koreans used this to their advantage in advancing but they began to experience the same problems themselves. The 5th Division and the two other units began advancing south slowly and cautiously, sending strong reconnaissance parties into the mountains to ensure {{they would not be}} threatened from the rear. However, this more cautious advance began to give the South Koreans valuable time to build up further south. By June 28, the 766th had infiltrated into Taebaek-san from Uljin and was moving toward Ilwolsan, Yongyang and Cheongsong in order to block communications between Daegu and Busan, where United States Army forces were landing in an attempt to support the collapsing ROK Army.|$|E
25|$|The United States Marine Corps's <b>Advanced</b> Base <b>Force</b> (<b>Advance</b> Base <b>Force</b> in some references) was {{a coastal}} and naval base defense force that was {{designed}} to set up mobile and fixed bases in the event of major landing operations within, and beyond, the territorial United States.

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War on June 25, 1950, Dean's division was the closest US ground unit to the Korean Peninsula. General of the Army Douglas MacArthur ordered Walker to deploy the division to South Korea as quickly as possible to resist the advancing forces of North Korea. Dean was ordered to send an advance battalion from his division by air to South Korea with a mission to advance and resist leading elements of the North Korean People's Army in an effort to delay them as much as possible while the remainder of the division followed by sea. Dean was given command of all US forces in Korea, and his division numbered 15,965 men and 4,773 vehicles at the time. On July 1, Dean organized the 406-man Task Force Smith from components of the US 21st Infantry Regiment and ordered it into Korea, as the <b>advance</b> <b>force.</b> As Task Force Smith advanced, Dean himself landed in Taejon on July 3 and set up his command post with Brigadier General John H. Church, the Assistant Division Commander, and Brigadier General George B. Barth, the Division Artillery commander, as his deputies. Dean ordered Barth forward to act as his forward commander for Task Force Smith, which began digging in at Osan to resist North Korean troops advancing after the capture of Seoul. Task Force Smith was subsequently defeated by North Koreans at the Battle of Osan the next day, and pushed back.|$|E
5|$|In early 1174, Henry's enemies {{appeared}} to have tried to lure him back into England, allowing them to attack Normandy in his absence. As part of this plan, William of Scotland attacked the south of England, supported by the northern English rebels; additional Scottish forces were sent into the Midlands, where the rebel barons were making good progress. Henry refused the bait and instead focused on crushing opposition in south-west France, and William's campaign began to falter as the Scots failed to take the key northern royal castles, {{in part due to}} the efforts of Henry's illegitimate son, Geoffrey. In an effort to reinvigorate the plan, Philip, the Count of Flanders, announced his intention to invade England and sent an <b>advance</b> <b>force</b> into East Anglia. The prospective Flemish invasion forced Henry to return to England in early July. Louis and Philip could now push overland into eastern Normandy and reached Rouen. Henry travelled to Becket's tomb in Canterbury, where he announced that the rebellion was a divine punishment on him, and took appropriate penance; this made a major difference in restoring his royal authority at a critical moment in the conflict. Word then reached Henry that King William had been defeated and captured by local forces at Alnwick, crushing the rebel cause in the north. The remaining English rebel strongholds collapsed and in August Henry returned to Normandy. Louis had not yet been able to take Rouen, and Henry's forces fell upon the French army just before the final French assault on the city began; pushed back into France, Louis requested peace talks, bringing an end to the conflict.|$|E

5000|$|While Montgomery and Bradley each favored {{relatively}} direct thrusts into Germany (with Montgomery and Bradley each {{offering to}} be the spearhead of such an assault), General Eisenhower disagreed.

25|$|In June 1913 the Advanced Base Force brigade was formed, {{composed}} of two permanently organized regiments, the Fixed Defense Regiment and the Mobile Defense Regiment. Each regiment was tailored to its specific part in the advanced base force concept. At the same time, numerical designations for companies were adopted to alleviate the problem of having more than one company A, for example, in any units of an expeditionary force. On 23 December 1913, the brigade was redesignated as the 1st <b>Advance</b> <b>Force</b> Brigade, and again on 1 April 1914, as the 1st Brigade. The 1st Brigade was deactivated on 15 August 1934, after participating in the Occupation of Haiti from August 1915 until August 1934.|$|E

When the Byzantine force reached the village of Selymbria, they learned from independent local farmers (thelematarioi) that the entire Latin garrison, and the Venetian fleet, were absent conducting a raid against the Nicaean island of Daphnousia. Although initially hesitant, due to both {{the small size of}} his force, which might be fatal if the Latin army returned, and because he would exceed his orders, Strategopoulos eventually decided not to lose such a golden opportunity to retake the city.|$|E
