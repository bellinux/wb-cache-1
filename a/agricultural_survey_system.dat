EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In censuses of agriculture prior to 2007, classification errors were measured by comparing an operation’s status on the census to its status on the Area Frame based June <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Survey.</b> In cases where there were discrepancies between the two, the June <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Survey</b> {{was assumed to be}} correct (since personal enumeration is used), and the operations were counted as a misclassification on the census. More benefits can be gained from examining why errors occur rather than estimating the amount of classification error, since classification error is not used to adjust census numbers. For 2007, {{the primary purpose of the}} Classification Error Survey was to identify reasons for discrepancies between the June <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Survey</b> and the census. The 2007 Classification Error Survey was a qualitative examination of why classification and reporting errors occur. Many operations do not report consistently between the June <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Survey</b> and the Census of Agriculture and the reasons for these discrepancies cannot be determined from the questionnaires alone. Discrepancies may be due to legitimate changes in acres operated between June and the end of the year; misclassification of the operation in the June <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Survey</b> or the census; or some other reporting error...|$|R

40|$|Most {{national}} or large-scale multiple-purpose <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Surveys,</b> {{because of their}} complex nature, {{should be based on}} multiple frame survey designs that use samples selected from an area frame, list frames of holdings and housing units, and point sampling methods. The problem is that, although such <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Surveys</b> imply important human and economic resources as well as time for their implementation and maintenance, the area and multiple frame survey methods already mentioned are simply not taught at most universities and statistical teaching institutions. In other words, it has been almost a worldwide tradition to teach in an inappropriate way <b>agricultural</b> <b>survey</b> methods. However those methods are widely used and involve specialized statistical knowledge for their implementation and analysis. In this paper we shall refer to the reasons of such lack of appropriate teaching as well as possible solutions...|$|R

40|$|New Zealand {{currently}} has a world-class property rights system that underpins {{the delivery of}} social, economic, and cultural benefits. This system comprises a land tenure system to provide certainty about property rights and a supporting cadastral <b>survey</b> <b>system</b> to provide certainty about the spatial extent of those rights. However, there is an increasing concern that New Zealand’s property rights system will not continue to be optimal in the future. A significant contributing factor to this concern is {{the inability of the}} cadastral <b>survey</b> <b>system</b> to handle three-dimensional (3 D) information defining the spatial extents of property rights in a digital environment. The development of 3 D cadastral <b>survey</b> <b>systems</b> {{is the subject of a}} substantial body of international research and discussion. Despite this, no country in the world has successfully implemented a fully functioning 3 D digital cadastral <b>survey</b> <b>system.</b> Also, while New Zealand has an interest in developing a 3 D digital cadastral <b>survey</b> <b>system,</b> there is no substantive local research on the matter. The research undertaken as part of this thesis will contribute to the literature by providing a New Zealand perspective on developing such a system and will also feed into the development of New Zealand’s cadastral <b>survey</b> <b>system.</b> This research explores New Zealand’s current cadastral <b>survey</b> <b>system</b> and considers the motivation for its enhancement. The literature supporting international research and development is evaluated to determine the characteristics, opportunities, issues and approaches associated with developing a cadastral <b>survey</b> <b>system</b> with 3 D digital capabilities. A preferred approach to a 3 D digital cadastral <b>survey</b> <b>system</b> is established and then developed at a conceptual level after it was found that an internationally standardised approach was inadequate...|$|R
