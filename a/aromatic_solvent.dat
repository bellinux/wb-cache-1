The standard curves for both pyridinium ionic liquids ([4 -mebupy]BF 4 and [3 -mebupy]N(CN) 2) were linear (r 2 5 0. 9980 – 0. 9998) in all <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvents</b> (toluene, benzene, ethylben-zene and o-xylene) in the concentration range of 5. 37 – 241 mg kg 21.

Because of thermodynamic equilibrium between the crude oil components, asphaltene is naturally suspended in crude oil; however, any disturbance such as pressure or composition changes results in accumulation and precipitation of asphaltene. Hydrocarbon production from oil reservoirs {{as well as}} fluids injection for secondary or tertiary oil recovery would affect the thermodynamic equilibrium which result in asphaltene precipitation and deposition in the reservoir and production facilities (Escobedo and Mansoori 2010; Kor et al. 2017; Mansoori 2009; Rabbani et al. 2018).

The validity of several physical solvent and empirical solvent scales was examined. Also, to predict dipolarity-polarizability (&# 960; *) solvent scale for some aromatic solvents. Model designing was also achieved to rationalize the <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvent</b> {{effect on the}} formyl proton CS. Approach: The previously recorded formyl proton CS for p-X- benzaldehydes, with X were NMe 2, OMe, OC 3 H 7, H, Br, CHO and NO 2 in benzene, toluene, p-xylene, m-xylene and mesitylene were subjected to Factor Analysis (FA). Target Factor Testing technique (TFT) was performed for several solvent scales namely: Unity, the intrinsic <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvent</b> induced shift of TMS (IASISTMS), f(n), f(d), (n 2 - 1) /(n 2 + 2), (d- 1) /(d+ 2), E T (30) and &# 960; *. Iterative TFT was applied to predict unmeasured (&# 960; *) solvent scale for ethyl benzene, n-butyl benzene, sec-butyl benzene, tert-butyl benzene and isopropyl benzene. Results: It {{has been found that}} two factors were responsible for the variation in the formyl proton CS. The unity, f(n), (n 2 - 1) /(n 2 + 2), IASISTMS, E T (30) and &# 960; * were real factors. Model designing of the formyl proton CS in benzene, toluene, p-xylene, m-xylene and mesitylene were achieved. The models with lowest root mean square error (RMSE) have shown that Unity is a consistent term. The other term was either IASISTMS or &# 960; *. Iterative TFT predicted new &# 960; * values for ethylbenzene, n-butylbenzene, sec-butylbenzene, tert-butylbenzene and isopropylbenzene respectively. Conclusion: FA has revealed that two real factors are responsible for the variation of formyl CS in benzene, toluene, p-xylene, m-xylene and mesitylene solvents. TFT has shown to be a powerful technique in predicting new values of the &# 960; * solvent scale. Model designing for the formyl proton CS have revealed that the IASISTMS, &# 960; * and Unity are the best empirical solvent scales and were better than any physical solvent scales in reproducing the formyl CS.

Molecular Dynamics provides a powerful simulation method to get insight in the behaviour of molecules under many conditions when considering atoms as charged solid spheres and hiding the quantum mechanics in effective potentials. We use this method to characterise the physical properties of different systems, e. g. polymers, water, organic and inorganic molecules. As an example of our work, we present a model of the pi-pi stacking dynamics of a perylene bisimide molecule when solvated in aromatic solvents. Our calculations show that the transition from the open (unstacked) to the stacked configuration is hindered by a small free energy barrier of approx. 1 kBT in the <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvent</b> toluene. The origin of this barrier is traced back to pi-pi interactions between perylene and the <b>aromatic</b> <b>solvent</b> which are very similar in nature to those between two PBI monomers. The stacking process proceeds in three phases via two well-defined transition states: (i) in the first phase, the two PBI molecules share part of their respective solvation shells forming the first transition state. Further approach needs to squeeze out the shared solvent layer thus creating the energy barrier. (ii) After removal of the separating solvent the two PBIs form a second transition state with one monomer located at a random position in the other’s solvation shell. (iii) Finally, the two PBIs slide {{on top of each other}} into their final stacked position...|$|E
