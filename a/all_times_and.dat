5|$|Each Clan has an {{identical}} hierarchical system. From birth, newborn kittens {{are known as}} ‘kits’, {{as evidenced by the}} ‘-kit’ suffix {{at the end of their}} name. Parents of the kits choose the names; often, a name is related to their appearance (‘Graykit’), an element of nature (‘Sandkit’), or in regards to how the parent felt when the kit was born (‘Brokenkit’). Mothers, known as ‘queens’, then look after their kits for their first six months of life. Kits are expected to stay in camp at <b>all</b> <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> sleep in a designated and comfortable area known as the ‘nursery’.|$|E

5|$|In the 1682 {{assembly}} of the Riksdag of the Estates, the king put forth his suggestion for military reform, whereby each of the lands of Sweden were to have 1,200 soldiers at the ready, at <b>all</b> <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> two farms were to provide accommodations for one soldier. His soldiers were known as Caroleans, trained to be skilled and preferring to attack rather than defend. Savaging and looting were strictly forbidden. Soldier huts around the country were the most visible {{part of the new}} Swedish allotment system. However, Charles also modernized the military techniques and worked to improve the overall skill and knowledge of the officers by sending them abroad to study.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{discover}} a wrecked Borg scout ship {{with a single}} survivor: a young Borg drone. Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) insists on treating the surviving Borg despite the concerns of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). On Picard's orders, the drone is confined and monitored by security forces at <b>all</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> is prevented from contacting the Borg Collective. Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Lt. Commander Data assist Crusher in bringing the Borg back to health. As they {{come to understand the}} workings of the Borg, La Forge and Data postulate an idea of using the Borg drone as a weapon of mass destruction. By implanting an unsolvable geometric formula into his mind and returning him back to the Collective, the formula should rapidly spread (similar to a computer virus) and disable the Borg. Crusher is aghast at this suggestion, considering it equivalent to genocide, while Picard and the other senior crew deliberate on the ethics of this plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{fountain}} looks unfinished, like concrete {{that has}} not been completely mixed. Up close, it is very rough and textured. There are several square pillars or cubed tubes that form a semi circle inside a pentagon shaped pool. The natural colored pillars jut out and crisscross from the corner of the plaza “like the tentacles of some immense geometrical octopus….breaking open.” There are two bridges, or walk ways (with stairs), that allow the public to stand in-between the tubes and have a view overlooking the plaza and city. A series of platforms at pool level permit pedestrian entry into the fountain and behind the falling water. The fountain and plaza are easily accessible to the public at <b>all</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> in all conditions, rain or shine. The fountain's budget was US$310,000, and it was dedicated on April 22, 1971. The Los Angeles Times reported that its actual cost was US$607,800.|$|E

5|$|Throughout its {{period at}} Ubon, No.79 Squadron formed {{part of an}} {{international}} force tasked with defending Thailand's air space against intruders. At {{the start of the}} deployment, tensions in Thailand were such that the squadron's personnel believed that they were at war. While the situation became more stable from late July 1962, No.79 Squadron maintained armed aircraft on alert at <b>all</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> scrambled Sabres when unidentified aircraft were detected. No air attacks were conducted against Thailand, however, and the unidentified aircraft that were intercepted almost always proved to be from the Central Intelligence Agency-controlled Air America. In January 1965 two Sabres accidentally overflew North Vietnam after becoming lost during a training sortie but returned safely to Ubon.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{personality}} cult {{was growing}} outrageously {{at a time}} when his health was in rapid decline. His physical condition was deteriorating; he was a lifelong heavy smoker, he had become addicted to sleeping pills, and had begun drinking to excess. Over the years he had become overweight. From 1973 until his death, Brezhnev's central nervous system underwent chronic deterioration and he had several minor strokes as well as insomnia. In 1975 he suffered his first heart attack. When receiving the Order of Lenin, Brezhnev walked shakily and fumbled his words. According to one American intelligence expert, United States officials knew for several years that Brezhnev had suffered from severe arteriosclerosis and believed he had suffered from other unspecified ailments as well. In 1977 American intelligence officials publicly suggested that Brezhnev had also been suffering from gout, leukemia and emphysema. He was reported to have been fitted with a pacemaker to control his heart rhythm abnormalities. Yevgeniy Chazov, the Chief of the Fourth Directorate of the Ministry of Health, had to keep doctors by Brezhnev's side at <b>all</b> <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> Brezhnev was brought back from near-death on several occasions. At this time, most senior officers of the CPSU wanted to keep Brezhnev alive, even if such men as Mikhail Suslov, Dmitriy Ustinov and Andrei Gromyko, among others, were growing increasingly frustrated with his policies. They did not want to risk a new period of domestic turmoil that might be caused by his death. At about this time First World commentators started guessing Brezhnev's heirs apparent. The most notable candidates were Suslov and Andrei Kirilenko, who were both older than Brezhnev, and Fyodor Kulakov and Konstantin Chernenko, who were younger; Kulakov died of natural causes in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} {{that it is impossible}} to paraphrase the content of the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's narrative structure. However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis on the present moment as being the only time period that really matters, because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown. The poem emphasizes that memory must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans must realize that the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from time on their own. The scene beneath London is filled with the time-bound people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they do not understand the Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God is the only one that is truly able to exist out of time and have knowledge of <b>all</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E

It enables bearers to log into certain services on the Internet, local computers or add a digital signatures into LibreOffice ODF documents or create DigiDoc formatted containers that also allows encryption during content transfer. While police officers and some other officials have a right to demand to see one of these documents, the law does not state that one is obliged to submit the document at that very moment.|$|E
