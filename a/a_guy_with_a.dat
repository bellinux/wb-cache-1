500|$|Michael J. Nelson, the show's head {{writer who}} also plays the {{character}} of the same name, said the staff initially felt strange making jokes at the expense of Rondo Hatton and his real-life illness; however, Nelson said, [...] "Then you realize it's {{the whole point of the}} movie: he's <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> big ugly face...And he is a terribly bad actor." [...] Paul Chaplin, another writer with the series, said of the actor's acromegaly: [...] "That fact opens up a large, irresolvable issue concerning the movie industry's use of this poor afflicted fellow; he was paid, after all, and movie work is nice work. Yet it can seem exploitative of misfortune." ...|$|E
500|$|For Deadpool's scarred appearance, Miller {{wanted him}} to appear [...] "fucking horrible" [...] to justify his anger in the film, while makeup {{designer}} Bill Corso had some leeway because in the comics [...] "he’s everything from a rotten corpse to <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> couple of lines on his face". Corso acknowledged the script's description of the character as disfigured but also {{wanted him to}} be [...] "still kind of charming and iconic". He wanted to avoid comparisons to Freddy Krueger, and looked to Sin City for inspiration. The final makeup required nine silicone prosthetics to cover Reynolds' head, which took several hours to apply. For the scene where the character is naked, it took six hours to apply the full-body makeup to Reynolds. Corso described the makeup {{for the rest of the}} film's characters as [...] "pretty simple. Tim wanted to keep it really grounded." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Young's first actions was to hire Ray Perkins as head coach. Perkins was an {{offensive}} assistant coach on the Dallas Cowboys under Hall of Fame coach Tom Landry. In his first draft, Young drafted quarterback Phil Simms from Morehead State University with the seventh overall draft pick {{to the surprise}} of many. Simms had never played on a winning team at Morehead State, and acknowledged after he was drafted that [...] "ost people have never heard of me." [...] Young was certain of the choice though saying, [...] "nce in a while {{you get a chance to}} get <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> great arm and great potential and you'd darn sight better take it." [...] Simms was unhappy with the selection, and had other teams which he favored playing on over the Giants. The Giants lost their first five games of the season with Joe Pisarcik starting at quarterback. Simms came on in relief of Pisarcik in the fifth game and started the next four, all of which the Giants won. They lost five out of their last seven however, finishing 6–10 for the year. They fell to 4–12 in 1980. Simms play was inconsistent, as he combined for 28 touchdowns against 33 interceptions while completing 48.8% of his passes over his first two seasons.|$|E

5000|$|On December 21, 2012, Wayne LaPierre, {{executive}} vice president of the National Rifle Association (NRA), expressed the gun-rights group's sympathy for the families of Newtown. He said, [...] "The only thing that stops <b>a</b> bad <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gun is <b>a</b> good <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gun," [...] and that debating legislation that won't work would be a waste of time.|$|R
500|$|Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "If this is torture porn, it's {{as if it}} was {{designed}} to be enjoyed by Michael Moore." [...] He closed his review saying, [...] "As usual, what gives the film whatever interest it has -- beyond satisfying the rapacious appetites of gore aficionados -- is the moral element attached to the various Rube Goldberg-style set pieces. Here, it's exemplified by a well-staged sequence in which a man must choose who lives or dies during a particularly lethal variation of musical chairs." [...] Roger Moore of Orlando Sentinel gave the film two out of five stars. He said the script [...] "has a more lyrical bent, and a more satiric bite, {{than any of the other}} Saw sequels" [...] and called the acting [...] "perfunctory on most fronts". [...] Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review, writing [...] "But, really, do reformers and victims of callous health insurers really want <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> penchant for elaborately constructed death panels of his own to be their advocate? Elsewhere, the usual critiques apply: terrible acting, zero suspense, laughable logic and the promise of another one next year. How can we get this policy canceled?" [...] Chris Hewitt of the St. Paul Pioneer Press gave the film a negative review. He was displeased that the film offered nothing new saying, [...] "The first three Saw movies had some intriguing ideas and an unusual way of presenting them, but the three most recent films have barely bothered to come up with anything fresh." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave the film three out of five, stating [...] "Saw VI gets back to Saw basics in gripping, gruesome manner." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{inspiration}} for album's single [...] "Somewhere Down the Crazy River", Lanois commented, [...] "Robbie Robertson was describing {{what it was like}} to hang out in Arkansas with Levon Helm in his old neighbourhood. He was telling me about the hot nights and fishing with dynamite, and was asking someone for directions for someplace somewhere down the crazy river. ... I had presented him with this instrument that [...] Eno introduced me to called the Suzuki Omnichord, like an electric autoharp. He found a little chord sequence with it that was sweet and wonderful. As he was developing his chord sequence I recorded him and superimposed his storytelling, which I was secretly recording, on top. That was the birth of [...] 'Somewhere Down The Crazy River.' It's kind of like <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> deep voice telling you about steaming nights in Arkansas." [...] This song is notable as Robertson's only solo hit in the UK, reaching number 15 on the UK singles chart.
