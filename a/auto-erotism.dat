5000|$|Ernest Jones {{tells us}} that 'at {{a meeting of the}} Vienna Psycho-Analytical Society on 10 November 1909 Freud had {{declared}} that narcissism was a necessary intermediate stage between <b>auto-erotism</b> and object-love'. The following year in his [...] "Leonardo" [...] he described publicly for the first time how 'the growing youngster...finds his love objects on the path of narcissism, since Greek myths call a youth Narcissus, whom nothing pleased so much as his own mirror image'. Although Freud only published a single paper exclusively devoted to narcissism called On Narcissism: An Introduction., in 1914, 'Narcissism was soon to take a central place in his thinking'.|$|E
50|$|Havelock Ellis was an English {{physician}} and writer {{born in the}} eighteen hundreds who studied human sexuality, and {{is referred to as}} one of the earliest sexologists. Ellis's work was geared towards human sexual behavior. His major work was a seven-volume publication called Studies in the Psychology of Sex, which related sex to society. Published in 1921, Studies in the Psychology of Sex covered the evolution of modesty, sexual periodicity, <b>auto-erotism,</b> sexual inversion, sexual impulse, sexual selection, and erotic symbolism. Ellis also conceived the term eonism, which references a man dressing as a woman. He elaborated on this term in his publication of Eonism and Other Supplementary Studies. He wrote Sexual Inversion as well in hopes to address any ignorance people have on the topic.|$|E
5000|$|The {{neurologist}} Albert Eulenberg {{was another}} one of the first researchers to look into algolagnia, in the 1902 Sadismus und Masochismus (Sadism and Masochism). Soon thereafter, Havelock Ellis also looked into algolagnia, in the early 1900s, and stated [...] "Sadism and Masochism - Algolagnia Includes Both Groups of Manifestations" [...] but maintained that that enjoyment of pain was restricted to an erotic context, in contrast to Krafft-Ebing's interpretations. With such titles as Analysis of the Sexual Impulse, Love and Pain, The Sexual Impulse in Women and The Evolution of Modesty, The Phenomena of Sexual Periodicity, <b>Auto-Erotism,</b> he described the basics of the condition. Eugen Kahn, Smith Ely Jelliffe, William Alanson White, and Hugh Northcote were other early psychological researchers into algolagnia.|$|E
