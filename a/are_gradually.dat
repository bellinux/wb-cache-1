The oldest samples, found in Nebraska, date to about 15million years ago. Fossils from 15million to about 5million years ago are restricted to the Nebraska-Kansas area, but more recent fossils <b>are</b> <b>gradually</b> more widely distributed. Fossils newer than 300,000years old are found in almost all the United States and southern Canada.|$|E

5|$|Presque Isle is a recurved, sand spit {{that formed}} {{during the last}} glacial period, or ice age, when the Laurentide Ice Sheet {{advanced}} into the basin now occupied by Lake Erie, and, when it retreated to the north between 12,370BC and 12,790BC, left behind a moraine consisting of clay, sand, and gravel that initially formed the Presque Isle peninsula. The deposits are constantly being re-worked by wave action and <b>are</b> <b>gradually</b> migrating to the northeast due to longshore drift.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd person {{singular}} and plural nominative forms, ngonggega and bogo, {{are labeled}} 'rare' because they <b>are</b> <b>gradually</b> becoming disused.

Moreover, since the person and number of the subject is contained in the prefix of the verb, nominative free pronouns are often dropped.|$|E
5|$|The journal has {{developed}} {{standards for the}} publication of mouse mutant studies. Many mouse mutant studies have serious methodological problems leading to fatally flawed scientific conclusions, causing a waste of time, effort, and research resources, and leading to ethical problems because of the unnecessary use of live animals for flawed studies. These standards <b>are</b> <b>gradually</b> being accepted more widely in the field.|$|E

5|$|When {{the mean}} orbital period of an {{asteroid}} is an integer {{fraction of the}} orbital period of Jupiter, a mean-motion resonance with the gas giant is created that is sufficient to perturb an asteroid to new orbital elements. Asteroids that become located in the gap orbits (either primordially because of the migration of Jupiter's orbit, or due to prior perturbations or collisions) <b>are</b> <b>gradually</b> nudged into different, random orbits with a larger or smaller semi-major axis.|$|E

By wearing pins or clothing {{from the more}} popular brands in that district, items' effects will be improved; wearing the least fashionable items will do the opposite, and items from brands in between are not affected. However, the player can increase a brand's popularity in one district by repeatedly fighting battles in that district while wearing items of that brand. The player can enter shops to buy new pins, clothes, and food items that <b>are</b> <b>gradually</b> consumed during battles to improve the characters' basic attributes.|$|E
5|$|Relatively new {{cells in}} a groove {{on the edges}} of the mantle secrete {{material}} that extends the periostracum. These cells <b>are</b> <b>gradually</b> displaced to the underside of the mantle by more recent cells in the groove, and switch to secreting the mineralized material of the shell valves. In other words, {{on the edge of the}} valve the periostracum is extended first, and then reinforced by extension of the mineralized layers under the periostracum. In most species the edge of the mantle also bears movable bristles, often called chaetae or setae, that may help defend the animals and may act as sensors. In some brachiopods groups of chaetae help to channel the flow of water into and out of the mantle cavity.|$|E

5|$|The Moon crosses {{from south}} to {{north of the}} {{ecliptic}} at its ascending node, and vice versa at its descending node. However, the nodes of the Moon's orbit <b>are</b> <b>gradually</b> moving in a retrograde motion, due to {{the action of the}} Sun's gravity on the Moon's motion, and they make a complete circuit every 18.6 years. This regression means that the time between each passage of the Moon through the ascending node is slightly shorter than the sidereal month. This period is called the nodical or draconic month.|$|E
5|$|A second bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund for the {{connection}} from Stonehouse to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal at Saul was rejected in 2007. This section presents some engineering challenges, {{as it was}} severed by {{the construction of the}} M5 motorway and the A38 road. The roundabout where the A38 joins the A419 road was built over Bristol Road Lock, and part of the route was destroyed by flood relief work for the River Frome. At Stonehouse, the bridge carrying the Bristol and Gloucester Railway {{has been replaced by a}} culvert, but a bid has been made to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board for its reinstatement, and to create a long-distance footpath along the route. Outside of the main restoration, the Cotswold Canals Trust <b>are</b> <b>gradually</b> restoring many of the other structures, with the ultimate goal of re-opening a link between the River Thames and the River Severn.|$|E
5|$|After {{coming of}} age, the Avatar is sent by Garon to inspect a Hoshidan {{fortress}} above the Bottomless Canyon. However, one of Garon's men, Hans, provokes {{a battle with}} the Hoshidans and throws the Avatar's mentor Gunter into the Canyon. The Avatar is found and captured by Hoshidan soldiers, who recognize them as a long-lost member of the Hoshidan royal family. The Avatar is brought to meet their blood relatives and Azura at the capital city. However, soldiers attack the city and a hooded assassin attempts to kill the Avatar. Mikoto shields them {{at the cost of}} her life. In the aftermath, the Avatar comes into possession of a legendary sword called Yato, said to belong to the one who will save the world. In the opening battle between the two kingdoms, the Avatar's two families meet, and the Avatar is forced to choose between siding with Hoshido and Nohr. In the Birthright and Conquest routes, the Avatar chooses either their biological or adopted family, respectively. This causes them to be denounced by the other side, and they <b>are</b> <b>gradually</b> forced to fight them.|$|E

5|$|The stone tool {{technology}} in {{use during the}} Middle Stone Age shows a mosaic of techniques. Beginning approximately 300 kya, the large cutting tools of the Achuelian <b>are</b> <b>gradually</b> displaced by Levallois prepared core technologies, also widely used by Neanderthals during the European Middle Palaeolithic. As the MSA progresses, highly varied technocomplexes become common throughout Africa and include pointed artifacts, blades, retouched flakes, end and side scrapers, grinding stones, and even bone tools. However, the use of blades (associated mainly with the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe) is seen at many sites as well. In Africa, blades {{may have been used}} during the transition from the Early Stone Age to the Middle Stone Age onwards. Finally, during the later part of the Middle Stone Age, microlithic technologies aimed at producing replaceable components of composite hafted tools are seen from at least 70 ka at sites such as Pinnacle Point and Diepkloof Rock Shelter in South Africa.|$|E
