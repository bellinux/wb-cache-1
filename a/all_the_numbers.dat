The {{most commonly used}} one is a rating task, which involves having participants judge <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> under a certain threshold (typically over 31 to mask the purpose of assessing connections to dates), indicating how much they like them on a 7-point rating scale. There is no standard algorithm for calculating implicit self-esteem. At least six algorithms are in use. In their meta-analysis of the name-letter effect, Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend using the ipsatized double-correction algorithm. The algorithms are typically applied to both {{the number of the}} day and of the month.|$|E

25|$|Gauss {{was a child}} prodigy. A contested story relates that, when he was eight, {{he figured}} out how to add up <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> from 1 to 100. There are many other anecdotes about his {{precocity}} while a toddler, and he made his first ground-breaking mathematical discoveries while still a teenager. He completed Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, his magnum opus, in 1798 at the age of 21, although it was not published until 1801. This work was fundamental in consolidating number theory as a discipline and has shaped the field to the present day.|$|E
25|$|In {{probability}} theory, {{the expected}} {{value of a}} random variable, intuitively, is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. For example, the expected value in rolling a six-sided die is 3.5, because the average of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> that come up in an extremely large number of rolls is close to 3.5. Less roughly, the law of large numbers states that the arithmetic mean of the values almost surely converges to the expected value {{as the number of}} repetitions approaches infinity. The expected value is also known as the expectation, mathematical expectation, EV, average, mean value, mean, or first moment.|$|E

25|$|The three early masses (Windhaager Messe, Kronstorfer Messe and Messe für den Gründonnerstag), {{composed}} between 1842 and 1844, {{were short}} Austrian Landmessen {{for use in}} local churches and did not always set <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of the ordinary. His Requiem in D minor of 1849 is the earliest work Bruckner himself considered worthy of preservation. It shows the clear influence of Mozart's Requiem (also in D minor) and similar works of Michael Haydn. The seldom performed Missa solemnis, composed in 1854 for Friedrich Mayer's installation, was the last major work Bruckner composed before he started to study with Simon Sechter, {{with the possible exception}} of Psalm 146, a large work, for SATB soloists, double choir and orchestra.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{game that}} is {{isomorphic}} to tic-tac-toe, but on the surface appears completely different. It is called Pick15 or Number Scrabble. Two players in turn say a number between one and nine. A particular number may not be repeated. The game is won by the player who has said three numbers whose sum is 15. If <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> are used and no one gets three numbers that add up to 15 then the game is a draw. Plotting these numbers on a 3×3 magic square shows that the game exactly corresponds with tic-tac-toe, since three numbers will be arranged {{in a straight line}} if and only if they total 15.|$|E
25|$|Apart from writing, the {{fundamental}} priestly sciences were arithmetics and calendrics. Within the social {{group of the}} priests at court, it had by Classical times become customary to deify the numbers {{as well as the}} basic day-unit, and – particularly in the south-eastern kingdoms of Copan and Quirigua – to conceive the mechanism of time as a sort of relay or estafette in which the 'burden' of the time-units was passed on from one divine numerical 'bearer' to the next one. The numbers were personified not by distinctive numerical deities, but by some of the principal general deities, who were thus seen to be responsible for the ongoing 'march of time'. The day-units (k'in) were often depicted as the patrons of the priestly scribes and diviners (ah k'in) themselves, that is, as Howler Monkey Gods, who seem to have been conceived as creator deities in their own right. In the Postclassic period, the time-unit of the katun was imagined as a divine king, as the 20 named days still are among the traditional 'day-keepers' of the Guatemalan Highlands. On a more abstract level, the world was assumed to be governed by certain fundamental numbers, first of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> 13 and 20 that, multiplied, defined both the mantic day count and, on a vast scale, the amount of time elapsed before the first day (5 Imix 9 Kumk'u) of the Long Count.|$|E

(This law of cancellation is proved in the article multiplicative group of integers modulo n.) That is, the sets R and aR = {ax1, ax2, ..., axφ(n)}, considered as sets of congruence classes (mod n), are identical (as sets - they may be listed in different orders), so the product of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> in R is congruent (mod n) to the product of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> in aR: ...|$|E
