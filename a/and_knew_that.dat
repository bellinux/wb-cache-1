5|$|His {{observations}} on catfish, electric fish (Torpedo) and angler fish are detailed, {{as is his}} writing on cephalopods including the octopus, cuttlefish and the paper nautilus. His claim that the octopus had a hectocotyl arm which was perhaps used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved, until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, <b>and</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> sharks and rays {{were part of the}} group he called Selachē (roughly, the modern zoologist's selachians).|$|E

Mary and her husband William Davis, a deputy U.S. Marshal, {{probably}} were aware of plans to build a lighthouse on the Florida coast somewhere between St. Augustine and Key West, <b>and</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Key Biscayne was a likely location for it. Mary and William sold three acres (about one-and-a-quarter hectares) of their newly acquired land at the southern tip of the island (Cape Florida) to the U.S. government for US$225. The federal government built the Cape Florida lighthouse on that land in 1825.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} and ferocity of the German Ardennes Offensive {{came as a}} shock and Strong was criticised for failing to predict it. However Smith defended Strong against criticism for failing to sound the alarm, feeling that Strong have given ample warning, which had been discounted or disregarded by himself and others. By 19 December, Strong had become concerned that the Germans were going to split Bradley's armies, and he and Whiteley – who had already received Monty's opinion on the matter – went to Smith, recommending that the armies north of the Ardennes be transferred from Bradley to Montgomery's command. Smith realised the military and political implications of this, <b>and</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> such a recommendation had to come from an American officer. On 20 December, Smith spoke to Eisenhower, who deferred judgement until the morning staff meeting. Eisenhower then phoned Bradley and Montgomery and ordered it. The decision was greatly resented by many Americans, particularly at 12th Army Group.|$|E

The First Baltic Front was ordered by STAVKA to move westward in order to stop Army Group North's remaining forces from escaping to Germany.

25|$|The Banner of Peace symbol has ancient origins. Perhaps its {{earliest}} known example appears on Stone Age amulets: three dots, without the enclosing circle.

But for the purposes of the Banner and the Pact, Roerich described the circle as representing the totality of culture, with the three dots being Art, Science, and Religion, three of the most embracing of human cultural activities. He also described the circle as representing the eternity of time, encompassing the past, present, and future. The sacred origins of the symbol, as an illustration of the trinities fundamental to all religions, remain central to the meaning of the Pact and the Banner today.|$|E
