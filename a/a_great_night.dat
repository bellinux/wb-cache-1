500|$|It took a {{long time}} for [...] to find [...] audience. It's great to see that now—however many years later— it went to a brief re-release by Warner Bros. [...] because of the cult following. Bravo says it's the most popular film they've shown in the New York area. [...] at the Telluride Film Festival. All [...] the people who run the festival are members of The Wanderers fan club, all wear Wanderers jackets, and [...] know every line in the film. They show the film at least twice a year up there [...] There were about 1000 people outside, under the {{mountains}} and watching the film. It was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E

500|$|B in the Mix: The Remixes {{received}} little promotion compared to Spears' standards. A promotional extended play (EP) titled Key Cuts from Remixed with several remixes from {{the album was}} released in September 2005. A contest was launched on Spears' paid fan site for those who pre-ordered the album. The winner received a copy of , a bottle of Spears' fragrance Fantasy with an additional lotion and make-up kit, and a personalized autographed picture of Spears. On November 22, 2005, the day the album was released, a release party was held at an unspecified nightclub in Los Angeles, California, organized by Spears' management and the webmaster of the fansite WorldOfBritney.com. It was a limited event to five hundred people, including members of the fansite or her official fan club. Spears commented: [...] "I {{just wanted to say}} that I love the idea of all my fans getting together to celebrate the release of my new album. I was happy to help! I hope you have <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>night</b> out at the club and dance all night long!".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{key factor}} in the {{build-up}} to Madchester was the sudden availability of the drug ecstasy in the city, beginning in 1987 and growing the following year. According to Dave Haslam: [...] "Ecstasy use changed clubs forever; {{a night at the}} Haçienda went from being <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>night</b> out, to an intense, life changing experience".|$|E
2500|$|Joey Alexander {{played at}} <b>A</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Night</b> in Harlem at the Apollo Theater, a {{performance}} honoring Herbie Hancock. His {{performance at the}} University of the District of Columbia garnered viral attention on the internet, drawing more than 500,000 views on Facebook. He also played in a concert with students of the Juilliard School, the proceeds of which funded his continuing stay in New York City. The concert, which received national media attention on NBC News, was successful {{enough for him to}} obtain an O-1B visa, which is granted to [...] "individuals with extraordinary ability". He also gave concert performances in 2014 at the Copenhagen Jazz Festival and the International Java Jazz Festival in Jakarta.|$|E
5000|$|A long {{dry season}} from December to February-March {{including}} {{a period in}} December that is characterized by <b>a</b> <b>great</b> freshness at <b>night</b> and in the morning, {{partly due to the}} northeast trade winds called Harmattan.|$|R
50|$|In May 2013, Forge Radio {{became the}} first ever {{committee}} to retain the Students' Union's 'Best Working Committee' award. There was also a nomination for Best Event for Forge Presents... and committee members Georgina Beardmore and Ollie Turner were recognised with Gold Outstanding Contributions to Committee Awards. Station Manager for 2012-13 James Kenny also won 'Best Committee Chair' to cap off <b>a</b> <b>great</b> award's <b>night</b> for Forge Radio.|$|R
50|$|The {{properties}} of SAR {{can be described}} as having high-resolution capability, which is independent of flight altitude, not being dependent on the weather, as SAR can select proper frequency range.

2500|$|Other {{positive}} reviews included Charles Spencer of The Telegraph, who raved, [...] "this is Lloyd Webber's finest show {{since the}} original Phantom, {{with a score}} blessed with superbly haunting melodies and a yearning romanticism that sent shivers racing down my spine." [...] He gave the show four stars out of five, but cautioned that [...] "The show may ultimately prove too strange, too dark, too tormented to become a massive popular hit, but I suspect its creepy allure will linger potently in the memory when frothier shows have been long forgotten". Paul Callan of the Daily Express also gave the show four stars, writing that Love Never Dies [...] "is an elegant and clever sequel to Phantom and deserves to have the old Adelphi Theatre filled every night with Lloyd Webber's core, usually middle-class, audiences. It is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>night</b> out." ...|$|E
60|$|It was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>night,</b> {{an immense}} night. There was {{reputation}} in it. I could hardly {{get to sleep}} for glorying over it.|$|E
6000|$|... "To-night {{is going}} to be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>night</b> in the history of Christendom," [...] said Clovis. [...] "We are going to {{massacre}} every Jew in the neighbourhood." ...|$|E
60|$|Colby Hall {{prepared}} for <b>a</b> <b>great</b> celebration that <b>night</b> {{in honor of}} their victory over Hixley High. Boxes and barrels had been stored away in anticipation of just such an occasion, and these were brought out and stacked up at a safe place along the river front.|$|R
5000|$|Klitschko {{also spoke}} about the fight, [...] "I do {{have great respect for}} Bryant Jennings and his achievements. He has good {{movement}} in the ring and good technique. I know this will be a tough challenge. I am extremely happy to fight in New York again. I had my first unification fight here and <b>a</b> lot of <b>great</b> heavyweight matches have taken place at Madison Square Garden. It will definitely be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> fight <b>night</b> and I will do everything for it from my side." ...|$|R
60|$|The Duke of Dorset, who entertained for his party, gave <b>a</b> <b>great</b> {{dinner that}} <b>night</b> at Dorset House, and towards its close the Prince of Saxe Leinitzer, who {{was almost the}} only non-political guest, moved up to his host in {{response}} to an eager summons. The Duke was perturbed.|$|R
60|$|This was {{the great}} speech on <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>night,</b> and Mr. Bertie Tremaine walked home with Trenchard. It was {{observed}} that Mr. Bertie Tremaine always walked home with the member {{who had made the}} speech of the evening.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it was a}} kind of screech, sir, {{and then}} I 'eard {{somebody}} drivin' very 'ard down the road. I remember thinking that it was strange that any one should be driving away from Crawley on <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>night</b> like this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>night</b> for Claybury, and {{for about}} a week nothing else was talked of.

60|$|Insato {{conducted}} Gopani-Kufa to the palace, {{and showing}} him his rooms, and the maidens who would wait upon him, {{told him that}} they would have <b>a</b> <b>great</b> feast that <b>night,</b> and on the morrow he might name his choice of the riches of Pita and it should be given him. Then he was away.|$|R
2500|$|The protagonist in {{the novel}} is a {{policeman}} named Detective Gorby, who is given the task of solving the murder. As Hume describes the character's investigative skills: [...] "He looked keenly round the room, and his estimate of the dead man's character was formed at once." [...] The author commented in a later introduction, [...] "All of the scenes in the book, especially the slums, are described from personal observation; and I passed <b>a</b> <b>great</b> many <b>nights</b> in Little Bourke Street, gathering material". At this time, the street had gained notoriety as a place frequented by prostitutes and criminals.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{wanted to}} be magnanimous; {{he wanted to have}} a fine moral pleasure. I know him so well," [...] Gertrude went on. Felix looked at her; she spoke slowly, gazing at the clear water. [...] "He thought of it <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal, <b>night</b> and day. He thought it would be beautiful. At last he made up his mind that it was his duty, his duty to do just that--nothing less than that. He felt exalted; he felt sublime. That 's how he likes to feel. It is better for him than if I had listened to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nobody {{made any}} further comment, but {{the eyes of}} {{most of us were}} turned expectantly upon the clock, until at last Gordon stood up when a rattle of wheels drew nearer. [...] "This is going to be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>night,</b> boys," [...] he said. [...] "The pernicious insect's come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My friends," [...] he said, {{after passing}} the pipe of peace round among the former, and {{offering}} {{it to the}} latter, who each took a whiff out of courtesy, [...] "this is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>night,</b> for we hev met to join ourselves together in a bond of friendship which I trust will not soon be broken.--Tell them that, Tonal'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's {{the biggest}} we've got; it's pretty big, but it isn't so big as Miss Chancellor's ideas," [...] added Doctor Prance. [...] "She has taken it {{to bring out}} Miss Tarrant before the general public--she has never {{appeared}} that way in Boston--on a great scale. She expects her {{to make a big}} sensation. It will be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>night,</b> and they are preparing for it. They consider it her real beginning." ...|$|E
5|$|As Marge {{prepares to}} leave Vancouver, she reveals to Homer {{that she is}} left-handed, but has always used her right hand to avoid seeming unusual (due to years of using her right hand, it renders her cross-dominant). She has enough dexterity to change Maggie's diaper and dress her one-handed. They return to the rink {{just in time to}} stop Seymour from {{forfeiting}} the match and go on to defeat Sweden for the gold. Agnes softens her attitude of unyielding contempt toward her son after he breaks his broom and has to drop out, and Marge and Homer agree that they had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> date <b>night.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Press for the HDIF {{has been}} {{extremely}} positive. [...] "Legendary indie club," [...] said the NME. [...] "Much-loved indie pop institution," [...] wrote The Quietus. [...] "With <b>a</b> decade of <b>great</b> <b>nights</b> under its belt How Does it Feel to Be Loved? is one of London's most enduring and influential underground indie get-togethers," [...] said Flavorpill. [...] "A speakeasy for anyone who suspects that their life is one big Smiths song," [...] declared Big Issue. In January 2015, it was named one of [...] "London's best indie nights" [...] by Time Out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Down deep {{under the}} ground--deep, deep, under all the ground--is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> hole. At <b>night,</b> {{when he has}} passed over the world, looked down on {{everything}} and finished his work, he, the sun, goes into his hole, and he crawls and creeps along it till he comes to his bed in the middle part of the earth. So then he, the sun, sleeps there in his bed all night.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>night</b> for prowling. A moon {{so little}} less than full that the eye could barely detect its slight {{tendency}} to become concave, shone serenely, creating a desirable combination of black shadows where the prowler might hide and great stretches of light in which the prowler might reveal his wickedness without disguise. Mr Pickering walked briskly along the road, then less briskly as he drew nearer the farm. An opportune belt of shrubs that ran from the gate adjoining {{the road to a}} point not far from the house gave him just the cover he needed. He slipped into this belt of shrubs and began to work his way through them.|$|E
60|$|It {{had been}} <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>night</b> for Nutty Boyd. If {{the vision of}} his sister Elizabeth, at home at the farm speculating sadly on the {{whereabouts}} of her wandering boy, ever came before his mental eye he certainly did not allow it to interfere with his appreciation of the festivities. At Frolics in the Air, whither they moved after draining Reigelheimer's of what joys it had to offer, and at Peale's, where they went after wearying of Frolics in the Air, {{he was in the}} highest spirits. It was only occasionally that the recollection came to vex him that this could not last, that--since his Uncle Ira had played him false--he must return anon to the place whence he had come.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>night</b> for {{business}} like this," [...] and again Hiram chuckled {{as if the}} whole matter was a huge joke. [...] "Here we are in one of his majesty's own boats, snug as bugs in a wet rug, and being carried faster than any ten-oared barge could move, we not raising a hand. Talk about getting out of Boston town! I can't say that it is any great trick, and we are going as comfortably as possible except, perhaps, that there's a little too much water about. If this 'ere thunder gust holds out ten minutes longer we should be well off the Penny ferry. It would give Silas a good shaking up if we got into camp before he did," [...] and Hiram laughed long and loud, seeming to enjoy making a noise now that we were the same as free from pursuit.|$|E
5000|$|Hilary Busis of Entertainment Weekly {{said of the}} episode, [...] "As the old superstition goes, a bad dress {{rehearsal}} all but guarantees <b>a</b> <b>great</b> opening <b>night.</b> And if the opposite {{also happens to be}} true, I would keep expectations low for next week's Smash -- because tonight's episode, [...] "The Dress Rehearsal," [...] was season 2's best by far. The main reason: For the most part, its plot focused on backstage intrigue rather than dull relationship drama—and when the latter did intrude upon the former, the result {{was more than just a}} bunch of people yelling at each other." [...] Sara Brady of Television Without Pity gave the episode a B- rating.|$|R
6000|$|... "There was the hitch, you see; it all lay in this. Mr. Timothy Beddingfield, the lawyer, had {{undoubtedly}} {{made himself}} scarce. He {{was last seen}} in company with the deceased, and wearing an Inverness cape and Glengarry cap; two or three witnesses saw him leaving the hotel at about 9.15. Then the messenger calls at the lawyer's house for the portmanteau, after which Mr. Timothy Beddingfield seems to vanish into thin air; but--and that is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> 'but'--the <b>night</b> porter at the 'Castle' seems to have seen some one wearing the momentous Inverness and Glengarry {{half an hour or}} so later on, and going up to deceased's room, where he stayed about a quarter of an hour.|$|R
50|$|Knitting clubs fulfill many purposes: to get {{together}} with other knitters, to learn or develop the skills of hand knitting or hand crocheting, <b>a</b> <b>great</b> fun <b>night</b> out. Clubs meet in coffee bars, pubs and clubs and members are drawn from all walks of life, including different generations, social classes, and genders. Crafters meet to exchange ideas about projects, chat about their lives, exchange yarns and yarn ideas for projects, or non-craft related activities, similar to a quilting bee. These clubs provide an atmosphere where beginning crafters can seek assistance from more experienced crafters. Due to the rise of the Stitch 'n Bitch books, amigurumi, and numerous other crochet and knit projects, both crafts have grown in popularity, and the demographics of those who practice the craft include younger women and some men.|$|R
