5|$|Despite many {{media and}} {{government}} {{claims to the}} contrary, Caroline Island {{was not the first}} point of land to see sunrise on January 1, 2000 (local time); that distinction belongs to a point of land between Dibble Glacier and Victor Bay on the coast of East Antarctica, at , where the sun rose 35 minutes earlier. As this point is close to the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circle,</b> and the area beyond the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circle</b> is affected by the continuous sunlight in December, the definition of the exact point becomes a question of distinguishing between a sunset and an immediate sunrise in view of atmospheric refraction effects.|$|E
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} months, the {{expedition}} explored the southern Pacific Ocean before Cook took Resolution south again—Adventure had retired back to South Africa after a fracas with the New Zealand native population. This time Cook {{was able to}} penetrate deep beyond the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circle,</b> and on 30 January 1774 reached 71°10'S, his Farthest South, but {{the state of the}} ice made further southward travel impossible. This southern record would hold for 49years.|$|E
5|$|The table {{does not}} include the {{numerous}} whaling voyages that took place during this period, or sub-Antarctic expeditions such as that of Carl Chun in 1898–99, which did not penetrate the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>circle.</b> The abortive Cope Expedition of 1920–22, which collapsed through lack of funding, is likewise excluded, though two men were landed from a Norwegian whaler and spent a year on the Antarctic peninsula.|$|E
5000|$|The Milky Way, or [...] "milk circle", {{was just}} one of 11 [...] "circles" [...] the Greeks {{identified}} in the sky, others being the zodiac, the meridian, the horizon, the equator, the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>circles,</b> and two colure circles passing through both poles.|$|R
5000|$|Our {{biosphere}} {{is divided}} {{into a number of}} biomes, inhabited by fairly similar flora and fauna. On land, biomes are separated primarily by latitude. Terrestrial biomes lying within the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circles</b> are relatively barren of plant and animal life, while most of the more populous biomes lie near the equator.|$|R
50|$|For powered aviation, {{the course}} of a round-the-world record must start and finish at the same point and cross all meridians; the course must be at least 36,770 km long (which is {{approximately}} the length of the Tropic of Cancer). The course must include set control points at latitudes outside the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>circles.</b>|$|R
5|$|Bottlenose dolphins, {{the genus}} Tursiops, {{are the most}} common members of the family Delphinidae, the family of oceanic dolphin. Recent {{molecular}} studies show the genus contains two species, the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), instead of one. Research in 2011 revealed a third species, the Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis). Bottlenose dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide. They live in all oceans except for the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circle</b> regions.|$|E
5|$|Farthest South was {{the most}} southerly latitudes reached by explorers before the conquest of the South Pole in 1911. Significant steps {{on the road to}} the pole were the {{discovery}} of lands south of Cape Horn in 1619, Captain James Cook's crossing of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circle</b> in 1773, and the earliest confirmed sightings of the Antarctic mainland in 1820. From the late 19th century onward, the quest for Farthest South latitudes became in effect a race to reach the pole, which culminated in Roald Amundsen's success in December 1911.|$|E
5|$|On {{its passage}} northward, Southern Cross halted at Franklin Island, off the Victoria Land coast, {{and made a}} series of {{magnetic}} calculations. These indicated that the location of the South Magnetic Pole was, as expected, within Victoria Land, but further north and further west than had previously been assumed. The party then sailed for home, crossing the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circle</b> on 28 February. On 1 April, news of their safe return was sent by telegram from Bluff, New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|It is not {{possible}} to have an ecliptic pole at the zenith in a dark sky. By definition, the ecliptic poles are located 90 degrees from the Sun's position. Therefore, whenever either ecliptic pole is directly overhead, the Sun must be on the horizon. The ecliptic poles can be at the zenith on the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Its Southern Hemisphere counterpart, {{marking the}} most southerly {{position}} {{at which the}} Sun can be directly overhead, is the Tropic of Capricorn. These tropics {{are two of the}} five major circles of latitude that mark maps of Earth, besides the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circles</b> and the Equator. The positions of these two circles of latitude (relative to the Equator) are dictated by the tilt of Earth's axis of rotation relative to the plane of its orbit.|$|R
500|$|A planet's {{life forms}} inhabit ecosystems, whose total is {{sometimes}} said {{to form a}} [...] "biosphere". Earth's biosphere {{is thought to have}} begun evolving about [...] The biosphere is divided into a number of biomes, inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals. On land, biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, height above sea level and humidity. Terrestrial biomes lying within the Arctic or <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circles,</b> at high altitudes or in extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life; species diversity reaches a peak in humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes.|$|R
5|$|Southern Cross left London on 23 August 1898, after {{inspection}} by HRH the Duke of York (the future King George V), {{who presented}} a Union Flag. Along with the expedition's personnel, equipment and provisions {{the ship was}} carrying Siberian sledge dogs, {{the first to be}} taken on an Antarctic expedition. After final provisioning in Hobart, Tasmania, Southern Cross sailed for the Antarctic on 19 December. She crossed the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circle</b> on 23 January 1899, and was then caught in the pack ice for three weeks. Cape Adare was sighted on 16 February, and the following day the ship was anchored close to the shore.|$|E
5|$|Middle {{latitude}} glaciers {{are located}} either between the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle, or between the Tropic of Capricorn and the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circle.</b> Both areas support glacier ice from mountain glaciers, valley glaciers and even smaller icecaps, {{which are usually}} located in higher mountainous regions. All are located in mountain ranges, notably the Himalayas; the Alps; the Pyrenees; Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast Ranges of North America; the Patagonian Andes in South America; and mountain ranges in New Zealand. Glaciers in these latitudes are more widespread and tend to be greater in mass the closer they are to the polar regions. They are the most widely studied over the past 150 years. As with examples located in the tropical zone, virtually all the glaciers in the mid-latitudes {{are in a state}} of negative mass balance and are retreating.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} left England on 30 September 1839, {{and after}} a voyage that was slowed by the many stops required to carry out work on magnetism, it reached Tasmania in August 1840. Following a three-month break imposed by the southern winter, they sailed south-east on 12 November 1840, and crossed the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circle</b> on 1 January 1841. On 11 January a long mountainous coastline that stretched to the south was sighted. Ross named the land Victoria Land, and the mountains the Admiralty Range. He followed the coast southwards and passed Weddell's Farthest South point of 74°15'S on 23 January. A few days later, as they moved further eastward to avoid shore ice, they were met {{by the sight of}} twin volcanoes (one of them active), which were named Mount Erebus and Mount Terror, in honour of the expedition's ships.|$|E
50|$|Whether anthropized or not, all land seldom a few {{locations}} {{has been}} claimed. Outside of the largely inhospitable Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>circles</b> and {{large portions of}} other uninhabitable landscapes, much of the globe has been used or altered in some direct way by humans. Land has been appropriated for many different reasons, but ultimately the outcome is typically a short-term benefit for humans. An area is anthropized is some way to make land available for housing, to harvest the resources, to create space for some anthropological reason, or many other possibilities.|$|R
50|$|The term {{night sky}} {{refers to the}} sky as seen at night. The term is usually {{associated}} with astronomy, with reference to views of celestial bodies such as stars, the Moon, and planets that become visible on a clear night after the Sun has set. Natural light sources in a night sky include moonlight, starlight, and airglow, depending on location and timing. The aurora borealis and aurora australis light up the skies of the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>circles</b> respectively. Occasionally, a large coronal mass ejection from the Sun or simply high levels of solar wind extend the phenomenon toward the equator.|$|R
25|$|The {{prevailing}} {{winds of}} the atmospheric circulation arise {{because of the}} difference in pressure at various latitudes and act as means for distribution of thermal energy on the planet. This pressure difference is because of the differences in solar insolation received at different latitudes and the resulting uneven heating of the planet. Alternating belts of high pressure and low pressure develop along the equator, the two tropics, the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>circles,</b> and the two polar regions, giving rise to the trade winds, the westerlies, and the polar easterlies. However, geophysical factors like Earth's orbit, its rotation, and its axial tilt cause these belts to shift gradually north and south, following the Sun's seasonal shifts.|$|R
5|$|The {{second of}} James Cook's {{historic}} voyages, 1772–1775, {{was primarily a}} search for the elusive Terra Australis Incognita that was still believed to lie somewhere in the unexplored latitudes below 40°S. Cook left England in September 1772 with two ships, HMS Resolution and HMS Adventure. After pausing at Cape Town, on 22 November the two ships sailed due south, but were driven to the east by heavy gales. They managed to edge further south, encountering their first pack ice on 10 December. This soon became a solid barrier, which tested Cook's seamanship as he manoeuvered for a passage through. Eventually, he found open water, and was able to continue south; on 17 January 1773, the expedition reached the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circle</b> at 66°20'S, the first ships to do so. Further progress was barred by ice, and the ships turned north-eastwards and headed for New Zealand, which they reached on 26 March.|$|E
25|$|Being {{located just}} South of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circle,</b> {{the weather is}} cold year round. Temperatures in summer barely go over freezing.|$|E
25|$|Some authors (including Huntford and Fiennes) {{associate}} {{up to two}} further deaths (the drowning of Robert Brissenden and {{the suicide}} of Hjalmar Johansen) with the two expeditions, but these happened outside the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As a {{preliminary}} trial before her cruise southward, Arneb {{participated in an}} operation in waters north of the Arctic Circle along {{the east coast of}} Baffin Island in August and September and then returned to Norfolk for final outfitting. On 14 November, 1955 Arneb got underway as flagship of [...] "Operation Deep Freeze I" [...] that would allow her to claim the distinction of crossing both the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circles</b> in the course of one year. She transited the Panama Canal on 20 November, stopped at New Zealand and Franklin Island before arriving at Kainan Bay and McMurdo Sound, where she stayed from 27 December 1955 to 30 January 1956. She returned to the United States via the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Atlantic Ocean, completing her circumnavigation of the globe upon her arrival at Norfolk on 5 May 1956.|$|R
50|$|At Greenwich, England (51.5°N), the {{duration}} of civil twilight will vary from 33 minutes to 48 minutes, depending {{on the time of}} year. At the equator, conditions can go from day to night in as little as 20-25 minutes. This is true because at low latitudes the sun's apparent movement is perpendicular to the observer's horizon. But at the poles, civil twilight can be as long as 2-3 weeks. In the Arctic and Antarctic regions, twilight (if there is any) can last for several hours. There is no astronomical twilight at the poles near the winter solstice (for about 74 days at the North Pole and about 80 days at the South Pole). As one gets closer to the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>circles,</b> the sun's disk moves toward the observer's horizon at a lower angle. The observer's earthly location will pass through the various twilight zones less directly, taking more time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design for}} the secretaire {{is the work of}} a working-joiner {{employed}} at the dockyard at Chatham. England, where the Resolute was broken up. The top is covered with morocco, bordered and embossed. The front panels contained carved medallion portraits of Her Majesty and the President of the United States; the side panels, Arctic subjects, also in relief; and the space {{at the back of the}} table, corresponding with the front panels, is furnished with a set of six drawers on either side, the handles of which are formed by two hands - male and female - grasping each other, symbolic of the goodwill existing between the heads of the two countries. The top cornices of the eight corner pedestals were appropriated to carved representations of the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>circles</b> and the American and English flags crossed, while busts of celebrated arctic explorers support the cornices.|$|R
25|$|Voyagers {{rounding}} Cape Horn frequently {{met with}} contrary winds and were driven southward into snowy skies and ice-encumbered seas; {{but so far}} as can be ascertained none of them before 1770 reached the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circle,</b> or knew it, if they did.|$|E
25|$|During their forced stay, {{several men}} lost their sanity, {{not only because}} of the Antarctic winter night and the endured hardship, but also because of the {{language}} problems between the different nationalities.

25|$|Finally, in 1642 Tasman {{showed that}} even New Holland (Australia) was {{separated}} by sea from any continuous southern continent.

You doubtless know that the polar regions even in the original attitude of the earth, owing to their receiving the rays of the sun obliquely, must have possessed a less genial climate than the parts of the orb that lie between the arctic and the <b>antarctic</b> <b>circles.</b> This was a wise provision of Providence to prevent a premature occupation of those chosen regions, or to cause them to be left uninhabited, until mind had so far mastered matter, as to have brought into existence the first monikin." ...|$|R
5000|$|There are a {{few other}} {{examples}} of these world maps copied from the Padrón Real that were given to various German princes. The mostimpressive copy of the Padrón Real is in the Vatican Library, and {{was given to the}} Pope by the Charles V of Spain in 1529. The large Vatican map (83.8 cm x 203.2 cm.) is on vellum, and thought {{to be one of the}} presentation copies made in the 1520s when Spain and Portugal were in a boundary dispute. The chart has a number of rhumb lines and compass roses found in medieval portolan navigation charts of the Mediterranean. The coastlines have many toponyms identifying particular places as well as claiming them for Spain. Ribeiro's map also has rudimentary latitude lines, a line marking the equator, the Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn, as well as the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>circles</b> all of which are relatively new innovations of the era.

60|$|Into {{the mysteries}} of the solid globe under his feet he had not yet pierced for five miles, and it was still not forty years since, with a tragic pertinacity, he had clambered to the poles of the earth. The {{limitless}} mineral wealth of the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>circles</b> was still buried beneath vast accumulations of immemorial ice, and the secret riches of the inner zones of the crust were untapped and indeed unsuspected. The higher mountain regions were known only to a sprinkling of guide-led climbers and the frequenters of a few gaunt hotels, and the vast rainless belts of land that lay across the continental masses, from Gobi to Sahara and along the backbone of America, with their perfect air, their daily baths of blazing sunshine, their nights of cool serenity and glowing stars, and their reservoirs of deep-lying water, were as yet only desolations of fear and death to the common imagination.|$|R
25|$|The {{rounding}} of the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn in the 15th and 16th centuries {{proved that}} Terra Australis Incognita ("Unknown Southern Land"), if it existed, was a continent {{in its own}} right. In 1773 James Cook and his crew crossed the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circle</b> {{for the first time}} but although they discovered nearby islands, they did not catch sight of Antarctica itself. It is believed he was as close as 150mi (241.4km) from the mainland.|$|E
25|$|The figure {{shows the}} {{geometry}} of a cross-section of the plane perpendicular to the ecliptic and through the centres of the Earth and the Sun at the December solstice when the Sun is overhead at some point of the Tropic of Capricorn. The south polar latitudes below the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circle</b> are in daylight, whilst the north polar latitudes above the Arctic Circle are in night. The situation is reversed at the June solstice, when the Sun is overhead at the Tropic of Cancer. Only at latitudes in between the two tropics {{is it possible for}} the Sun to be directly overhead (at the zenith).|$|E
25|$|Sailor Carl Wiencke {{was lost}} {{overboard}} {{en route to}} Antarctica, Wiencke Island being named in his honour. Belgica crossed the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circle</b> on 15 February 1898. On 3 March, Belgica became wedged in the pack ice. The crew had not prepared for overwintering in Antarctica well. De Gerlache forbade the crew to eat the penguin and seal meat that had been stockpiled because he hated eating it. As a result, scurvy became a problem on board Belgica. Following the death of magnetician Emile Danco on 5 June 1898, the situation worsened. Morale worsened {{after the death of}} Nansen, the ship's cat, on 22 June.|$|E
50|$|At the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>circles,</b> {{at roughly}} 66½° North and South {{latitude}} respectively, {{a degree of}} the ecliptic becomes circumpolar. If the sun for example occupies that degree, it will neither rise nor set, but will lie upon the horizon for 24 hours. As we move into higher latitudes, more and more degrees of the ecliptic will neither rise nor set, until at the north pole half of the ecliptic degrees will not rise above the horizon and can never become the ascendant. There of the omission of extreme latitudes from most house tables due to the added complexity of calculating the ascendant, {{that there is no}} ascendant at these latitudes. This is of course untrue, yet there is a limitation on the degrees that can ascend at extreme latitudes and a further restriction on degrees that can form house cusps in time-based house systems. The simpler and earlier ecliptic-based house systems can form house cusps at extreme latitudes based on the available ascendant and midheaven degrees.|$|R

60|$|The {{researches}} of the Challenger expedition {{into the}} nature of the sea-bottom show, that the whole of the land debris brought down by rivers to the ocean (with the exception of pumice and other floating matter), is deposited comparatively near to the shores, and that the fineness of the material is an indication of the distance to which it has been carried. Everything in the nature of gravel and sand is laid down within a very few miles of land, only the finer muddy sediments being carried out for 20 or 50 miles, and the very finest of all, under the most favourable conditions, rarely extending beyond 150, or at the utmost, 300 miles from land into the deep ocean.[164] Beyond these distances, and covering the entire ocean floor, are various oozes formed wholly from the debris of marine organisms; while intermingled with these are found various volcanic products which have been either carried through the air or floated on the surface, and a small but perfectly recognisable quantity of meteoric matter. Ice-borne rocks are also found abundantly scattered over the ocean bottom within a definite distance of the arctic and <b>antarctic</b> <b>circles,</b> clearly marking out the limit of floating icebergs in recent geological times.|$|R
