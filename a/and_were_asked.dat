Auditions for the lead roles took place in New York and Los Angeles. The casting director shortlisted 1,000 actors who had applied for each role down to 75. Those who received a callback read again in front of Crane, Kauffman and Bright. At the end of March, the number of potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part, <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to read for Les Moonves, then-president of Warner Bros.

5|$|The Hot Latin Songs chart (formerly Hot Latin 50 and Hot Latin Tracks), {{published}} in Billboard magazine, {{is a record}} chart based on Latin music airplay. The data were compiled by the Billboard chart and research department with information from 70 Spanish-language radio stations in the United States and Puerto Rico. Those radio stations were selected based on their number of listeners, <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to report their playlists for the week. This information was then entered to the Billboard computer system, and points were tabulated for each song. This data are compiled by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems, which electronically monitors radio stations in more than 120 music markets across the United States. Before this chart's inception, the Latin music information on the magazine was presented only {{in the form of}} the biweekly album sales chart Top Latin Albums, which continues to be listed separately.|$|E
5|$|In 595, Gregory chose Augustine, prior of Gregory's own monastery of St Andrew in Rome, to {{head the}} mission to Kent. Gregory {{selected}} monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish kings. The pope wrote {{to a number of}} Frankish bishops on Augustine's behalf, introducing the mission and asking that Augustine and his companions be made welcome. Copies of letters to some of these bishops survive in Rome. The pope wrote to King Theuderic II of Burgundy and to King Theudebert II of Austrasia, as well as their grandmother Brunhilda of Austrasia, seeking aid for the mission. Gregory thanked King Chlothar II of Neustria for aiding Augustine. Besides hospitality, the Frankish bishops and kings provided interpreters <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to allow some Frankish priests to accompany the mission. By soliciting help from the Frankish kings and bishops, Gregory helped to ensure a friendly reception for Augustine in Kent, as Æthelbert was unlikely to mistreat a mission which enjoyed the evident support of his wife's relatives and people. The Franks at that time were attempting to extend their influence in Kent, and assisting Augustine's mission furthered that goal. Chlothar, in particular, needed a friendly realm across the Channel to help guard his kingdom's flanks against his fellow Frankish kings.|$|E

25|$|O'Donoghue hid {{a number}} of unused grenades on the farm {{and the two men}} went their {{separate}} ways. At about 2AM at least eight armed men entered the house and went upstairs into the brothers' bedroom. The brothers got up and stood at the bedside <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> their names. When they answered, the gunmen opened fire. Both brothers were shot dead and their elderly relative, William Dunlea, was wounded by gunfire. According to Daniel Delaney, the father of the brothers, the gunmen wore long overcoats and spoke with English accents. It is thought that, while searching the site of the ambush, the Auxiliaries had found a cap belonging to one of the volunteers and had used bloodhounds to follow the scent to the Delaney home.|$|E

25|$|The {{first two}} members of each family {{appeared}} at the face-off podium <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> a question to which only the number-one answer was available. Giving the top answer added the value for that question to the family's bank. The process then repeated with the four remaining members from each family. On {{the first half of}} the daytime version, families were staked with $2,500. The first question was worth $500, with each succeeding question worth $500 more than the previous, with the final question worth $2,500. This allowed for a potential maximum bank of $10,000. For the second half of the daytime version, and also on the syndicated version, all values were doubled, making the maximum potential bank $20,000. The team that eventually won the game played for their bank in Fast Money.|$|E
25|$|In 1894/5 Andrew Stoddart led {{a team to}} Australia {{that played}} five Tests in a see-saw series that saw England win the Ashes by 3 games to 2. The first Test started as a high-scoring affair, with Australia making a then-record 586 runs thanks to 201 from Syd Gregory and 161 from George Giffen. England replied with 325 <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to {{follow-on}} 261 behind. They made 437 to set Australia a target of only 177. Australia reached 113–2 at close of play, needing only another 64. Rain fell overnight, and Australia allowed play to be delayed for 20 minutes as a couple of England players, including slow left-arm spinner Bobby Peel had not reached the ground on time because they were hungover. Australia fell 10 short, with Peel taking 6 wickets and Briggs 3 on a pitch {{that had been made}} helpful by the rain. This was the first time a side following-on had won a Test match.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study by}} {{psychologist}} Melissa Williams et al., published in 2010, study participants were given pairs {{of male and female}} first names, and asked to estimate their salaries. Men and to a lesser degree women estimated significantly higher salaries for men than women, replicating previous findings. In a subsequent study, participants were placed in the role of employer <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to judge what newly hired men and women deserve to earn. The researchers found that men {{and to a lesser extent}} women assign higher salaries to men than women based on automatic stereotypic associations. The researchers argue that observations of men as higher earners than women has led to a stereotype that associates men (more than women) with wealth, and that this stereotype itself may serve to perpetuate the wage gap at both conscious and nonconscious levels. For example, a male-wealth stereotype may influence an employer's initial salary offer to a male job candidate, or a female college graduate's intuitive sense about what salary she can appropriately ask for at her first job.|$|E

25|$|One {{experiment}} that {{was conducted to}} test the mere-exposure effect used fertile chicken eggs for the test subjects. Tones of two different frequencies were played to different groups of chicks {{while they were still}} unhatched. Once hatched, each tone was played to both groups of chicks. Each set of chicks consistently chose the tone prenatally played to it. Zajonc tested the mere-exposure effect by exposing Chinese characters for shorts amounts of time to two groups of individuals. The individuals were then told that these symbols represented adjectives <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to rate whether the symbols held positive or negative connotations. The symbols that had been previously seen by the test subjects were consistently rated more positively than those unseen. In a similar experiment, the individuals were not asked to rate the connotations of the symbols, but to describe their mood after the experiment. Members of the group with repeated exposure to certain characters reported being in better moods and felt more positive {{than those who did not}} receive repeated exposure.|$|E
25|$|Returning {{again to}} South Africa {{to play for}} his third {{domestic}} team in Eastern Province, Vogler scored 505 runs {{at an average of}} 36 per innings, but he set a domestic season record with fifty-five wickets in nine games for the amazing average of 10.54. By this time, Vogler had improved upon the methods of Bosanquet and Schwarz, being able not only to at a faster pace disguise which way he was turning the ball, but to flight it with skill so that it would do things in the air that batsmen could not predict. Against Griqualand West in the 1906–07 Currie Cup, Vogler put in an all-round performance. Eastern Province batted upon winning the toss, and Vogler second top-scored with 79 to help his team to 403 all out. He then took 6/12 from ten overs as Griqualand West collapsed to 51 all out, <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to follow on. In the second innings, Vogler took all ten wickets for 26 runs, and Griqualand West were dismissed for 51 once more. Eastern Province finished as victors by an innings and 301 runs.|$|E
25|$|For {{the second}} time in less than a month, Glenn McGrath was ruled out of a test due to injury – this time with elbow problems. Australia also dropped Jason Gillespie from their side after taking just three wickets so far in the series. In contrast, England {{remained}} with their original starting XI from the first Test. They carried on their first innings form with their best of the series (477 all out), before England's bowlers managed to swing the ball prodigiously to leave Australia at 99/5 and 175/9. Despite the best efforts of Brett Lee, Australia finished 259 runs behind England <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to follow-on – {{for the first time in}} 17 years. However, with the need to bowl for two innings in a row, Simon Jones, England's best swing bowler, started showing signs of injury and was taken to hospital for a scan on his ankle. Australia were then able to post a target for England to chase, but on a wearing pitch with Shane Warne getting large amounts of turn, England struggled in their pursuit of 129, winning by three wickets in the end.|$|E
