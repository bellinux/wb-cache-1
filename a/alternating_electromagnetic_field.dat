50|$|A {{relevant}} suggested {{scheme of}} sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation using gas bubbles as the active medium was introduced around 1995 The pumping {{is created by}} mechanical oscillations of a cylindrical resonator and the phase bunching of bubbles is realized by acoustic radiation forces. A notable fact is that gas bubbles can only oscillate under an external action, but not spontaneously. According to other proposed schemes, the electrostriction oscillations of the dispersed particle volumes in the cylindrical resonator are realized by an <b>alternating</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>field.</b> However, a SASER scheme with an alternating electric field as the pump has a limitation. A very large amplitude of electric field (up to tens of kV/cm) is required to realize the amplification. Such values approach the electric puncture intensity of liquid dielectrics. Hence, a study proposes a SASER scheme without this limitation. The pumping is created by radial mechanical pulsations of a cylinder. This cylinder contains an active medium—a liquid dielectric with gas bubbles. The radiation emits through {{the faces of the}} cylinder.|$|E
50|$|In the {{detection}} sub-process location and property vectors are recorded to allow particle localization for ejection and material classification for discrimination purposes. All detection technologies applied {{have in common}} to be cheap, contactless and fast. The technologies are subdivided in transmitting and reflecting groups, the first measuring the inner content of a particle while the later only uses the surface reflection for discrimination. Surface, or reflection technologies have the disadvantage that the surfaces need to be representing the content, thus need to be clean from clay and dust adhesions. But by default surface reflection technologies violate the Fundamental Sampling Principle because not all components of a particle have the same probability of being detected. The main transmitting technologies are EM (Electromagnetics) and XRT (X-ray-Transmission). EM detection {{is based on the}} conductivity of the material passing an <b>alternating</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>field.</b> The principle of XRT is widely known through the application in medical diagnostics and airport luggage scanners. The main surface or reflection technologies are traditionally X-ray luminescence detectors capturing the fluorescence of diamonds under the excitation of X-ray radiation and color cameras detecting brightness and colour difference. Spectroscopic methods such as near-infrared spectroscopy known from remote sensing in exploration in mining for decades, have found their way into industrial scale sensor-based sorters. Advantage of the application of near-infrared spectroscopy is that the evidence can be measured on the presence of specific molecular bonds, thus minerals composition of the near-infrared active minerals. There is more detection technologies available on industrial scale sensor-based ore sorters. Readers that want to go into detail can find more in the literature.|$|E

Müller and their eggs, adults and eggs of H. aspersa maxima Taylor and H. aspersa aspersa O. F. Müller were exposed to such fields with different parameters, and the following life cycle traits were observed: condition of hibernating adults, their survival rate during hibernation and reproduction, egg mass, hatching success, growth rate of hatchlings and body mass of next generation adults. Adults were exposed to sinusoidal, <b>alternating</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>fields</b> of 50 Hz, 100 Hz and 200 µT, and magnetic induction of 50 Hz, {{as well as a}} field of 175 µT and 10 – 1000 Hz (repetition period 80 minutes). Egg batches were exposed to direct magnetic fields of magnetic induction 5 µT and 10 µT and <b>alternating</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>fields</b> of analogous induction and frequency of 50 Hz. The effects varied depending on the parameters of the fields, subspecies and life cycle stage. Adult H. aspersa maxima was more sensitive to the changes in characteristics of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>field</b> than H. aspersa aspersa, but the two subspecies showed a similar reaction to exposing their eggs to direct or al-ternating magnetic field. Probably direct field had a greater selection effect compared to alternating field, re-moving weaker genotypes at embryonic stage; this resulted in a greater mean body mass of the next gener-ation adults. The results are preliminary; further studies, with further modifications of parameters of the fields applied are necessary...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work was to measure the {{velocity}} of dendrite growth in undercooled Ni–Al alloy melts as a function of undercooling. The experiments were performed both by containerless electromagnetic levitation on Earth and under reduced gravity conditions during parabolic flight campaigns.

In turn, the <b>alternating</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>fields</b> induce convection, which is strong under terrestrial conditions while much weaker in reduced gravity. The heat and mass transport in front of the solid-liquid interface during solidification controls the dynamics of dendrite growth.

The methodology is based on measuring the energy absorbed by the electronic system from <b>alternating</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>fields</b> as function of their frequency. Experiments on three-dimensional (3 D) amorphous indium-oxide films suggest that, in the strongly localized regime, the energy spectrum is discrete and inelastic electron-electron events are strongly suppressed.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can potentially act like “lighting rods ” or exhibit direct physical force on cell membrane under <b>alternating</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>fields</b> thus reducing the required field strength. A cell poration/ablation system was built for exploring these effects of CNTs in which two-electrode sets were constructed and two perpendicular electric fields could be generated sequentially. By applying this system to breast cancer cells {{in the presence of}} multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs), the effective pulse amplitude was reduced to 50 V/cm (main field) / 15 V/cm (alignment field) at the optimized pulse frequency (5 Hz) of 500 pulses. Under these conditions instant cell membrane permeabilization was increased to 38. 62 %, 2. 77 -fold higher than that without CNTs. Moreover, we also observed irreversible electroporation occurred under these conditions, such that only 39. 23 % of the cells were viable 24 h post treatment, in contrast to 87. 01 % cell viability without presence of CNTs. These results indicate that CNT-enhanced electroporation has the potential for tumour cell ablation by significantly lower electric fields than that in conventional electroporation therapy thus avoiding potential risk...|$|R
