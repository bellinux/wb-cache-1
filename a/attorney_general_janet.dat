5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{discovery}} of the Watkins memo, and based upon a suggestion from the Office of Independent Counsel, on March 20, 1996, <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno requested that Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr expand his inquiry to specifically include the travel office affair, in particular allegations that White House employees had lied about Hillary Clinton's role in the firings, and that David Watkins or Hillary Clinton had made false statements in previous testimony to the GAO, Congress, or the Independent Counsel.|$|E
5|$|McVeigh {{later said}} that he had {{contemplated}} assassinating <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he {{said that he}} sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.|$|E

5000|$|In 1997, {{after the}} {{retirement}} of Jamie Gorelick, Clinton nominated Holder to be the Deputy <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> under <b>Janet</b> Reno. Holder was confirmed several months later in the Senate by a unanimous vote. During his confirmation hearing, Holder's opposition {{to the death penalty}} was questioned, but he pledged his intention to cooperate with the current laws and Reno, saying, [...] "I am not a proponent of the death penalty, but I will enforce the law as this Congress gives it to us." [...] Holder was the first African-American to serve in that position.|$|R
5|$|In 1997, Carl Williams, the {{superintendent}} of the New Jersey State Police, {{wrote a letter to}} Pope John Paul II asking him to raise the issue of Shakur's extradition during his talks with President Fidel Castro. During the pope's visit to Cuba in 1998, Shakur agreed to an interview with NBC journalist Ralph Penza. Shakur later published an extensive criticism of the NBC segment, which inter-spliced footage of Trooper Foerster's grieving widow with an FBI photo connected to a bank robbery of which Shakur had been acquitted. On March 10, 1998 New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman asked <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno to do whatever it would take to return Shakur from Cuba.

25|$|Inslaw {{is known}} for {{developing}} Promis, an early case management software system. It is also known for a lawsuit that it brought against the United States Department of Justice in 1986 over Promis. Inslaw won damages in bankruptcy court, but these were overturned on appeal.

Barr, and a lengthy review of the special counsel's report under <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno. Inslaw's claims were finally referred by Congress to the Court of Federal Claims in 1995, and the dispute ended with the Court's ruling against Inslaw in 1998.|$|E
500|$|ASL is {{distinguished}} by its requirement that all second-year students complete a mandatory Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) class.

500|$|On June 18, 1996, <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno {{asked the}} FBI {{to look into}} it; FBI Director Louis Freeh {{acknowledged}} that both the FBI and especially the White House had committed [...] "egregious violations of privacy" [...] (in some cases the background reports contained information about extramarital affairs, trangressions with the law, and medical issues). On June 21 Reno decided it was {{a conflict of interest}} for the U.S. Department of Justice to further investigate the matter, and thus recommended that it be folded into the overall umbrella of the Whitewater investigations, under charge of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. In any case, Starr had already begun looking into it.|$|E

Bob Guccione of Penthouse volunteered to publish it, but Kaczynski replied that, since Penthouse was less [...] "respectable" [...] than the other publications, he would in that case [...] "reserve the right to plant one (and only one) bomb intended to kill, after our manuscript has been published." [...] The pamphlet was published by The New York Times and The Washington Post on September 19, 1995. Penthouse never published it.|$|E
500|$|President Bill Clinton {{nominated}} {{her as an}} Associate Justice of the Supreme Court on June 14, 1993, to {{fill the}} seat vacated by retiring Justice Byron White. Ginsburg was recommended to Clinton by then-U.S. <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno after a suggestion by Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch. At {{the time of her}} nomination, Ginsburg was viewed as a moderate. President Clinton was reportedly looking to increase the Court's diversity, which Ginsburg did as the first Jewish justice since the 1969 resignation of Justice Abe Fortas and as only the second female appointee. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated Ginsburg as [...] "well qualified", its highest possible rating for a prospective justice.|$|E
500|$|Kaczynski was {{the target}} of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) longest and costliest investigation. Before his {{identity}} was known, the FBI used the title [...] "UNABOM" [...] (UNiversity & Airline BOMber) to refer to his case, which resulted in the media calling him the Unabomber. The FBI (as well as <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno) pushed for the publication of Kaczynski's manifesto, which led to his sister-in-law, and then his brother, recognizing Kaczynski's style of writing and beliefs from the manifesto, and tipping off the FBI. After his arrest in 1996, Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wanted to plead insanity {{in order to avoid the}} death penalty, as he did not believe he was insane. In 1998 a plea bargain was reached, under which Kaczynski pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.|$|E

Based on electronic and phone intercepts, physical evidence from Nairobi, and interrogations, officials soon suspected bin Laden as the perpetrator of the attacks. On August 8, the White House asked the CIA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to prepare a targets list; the initial list included twenty targets in Sudan, Afghanistan, and an unknown third country, although it was narrowed down on August 12.|$|E
500|$|Also on Patton's {{agenda was}} a reformation of Kentucky's {{juvenile}} justice system. Under Brereton Jones, {{because of its}} system of housing and treating juvenile offenders, Kentucky {{had been one of}} only two states unable to qualify for federal grants. Among the problems cited by the Department of Justice were abuse of juveniles by state employees, and failure to hold juvenile and adult offenders separately from each other. Governor Jones entered into a consent decree to ameliorate the situation, but his term expired before he could meaningfully address the terms of the decree. Patton went beyond the terms of the [...] decree by implementing mandatory training for state employees who dealt with juvenile offenders, and by setting up a hotline for juveniles to report abuse anonymously. He shifted the responsibility for housing juveniles from local communities to the state, constructing nine new juvenile detention centers. In January 2001, <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno proclaimed Kentucky's juvenile justice system a model for the nation.|$|E

The {{following}} year, {{he moved}} to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer (P-I), beginning the first of two stints at the paper that would last six years in total. His first major assignment at the P-I was a five-month investigation of child abuse prosecutions in Wenatchee, Washington with Mike Barber in 1998. Their findings, published in the five-part series [...] "The Power to Harm", uncovered false confessions from child witnesses and other abuses by authorities in the wrongful arrests of 43 adults, some of whom would be convicted and sentenced to prison. The newspaper's investigation led to the establishment of Innocence Project Northwest, which overturned or reduced the case's 18 verdicts, freeing all of the defendants by the end of 2000; it also convinced U.S. <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> Reno to review the cases on alleged wrongdoing by police, prosecutors and social workers.
