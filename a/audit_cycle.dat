40|$|The {{direct costs}} of {{managing}} adverse outcomes from Australian health care {{are estimated to}} be $ 2 billion. The <b>audit</b> <b>cycle</b> is considered an important tool to assist in the preventive management of adverse outcomes. Australian guidelines for <b>audit</b> <b>cycle</b> design allow for comparison of data sets derived from similar surgical specialities. However a lack of data set standardisation inhibits meaningful comparisons of foot and ankle surgical audits. This research will assist development of a best practice model for auditing foot and ankle surgery. Data derived from this model will improve the safety and quality of foot and ankle surgery. The preliminary phase of this process is to identify and understand the attitudes and behaviours of how and why surgeons participate in the <b>audit</b> <b>cycle.</b> A descriptive embedded multiple case study research design is planned to provide an intense focus on a single phenomenon (the <b>audit</b> <b>cycle)</b> within its real life context (clinical governance). The measures {{to be included in the}} case study have been identified by the Balanced Patient Safety Measurement Framework. These include: audit and peer review activity, provider attitudes to patient safety, safety learning, action and performance. A purposive sample of 6 to 8 surgeons (units of analysis) from 3 to 4 specialities (cases) will undergo semi-structured interview. This will investigate: current audit tools and processes; attitudes; and behaviours of surgeons to the <b>audit</b> <b>cycle.</b> Similarities in and differences between the units of analysis will indicate which identified measures function as barriers or enablers of the <b>audit</b> <b>cycle.</b> Reliability and validity (external and construct) will be assessed using established methods for case studies.

40|$|It {{is common}} for {{hospital}} inpatients on warfarin to suffer from fluctuations in their INR (international normalised ratio). Raised INRs are potentially very dangerous and may result in acute life-threatening haemorrhages. Conversely, low INRs may increase the risk {{for the development of}} venous thromboembolism. Having observed many deranged INRs among hospital inpatients, we decided to focus our project on identifying the contributing factors to deranged INRs and ways to address this problem. We analysed the warfarin prescriptions on all drug charts and surveyed the junior doctor staff. Our results revealed poor knowledge and confidence levels on warfarin prescribing among junior doctor staff. This is likely to be reflected in the poor completion rate of warfarin prescriptions. We instituted practical changes to resolve the issue: most importantly, a change to the warfarin administration time from 6 pm to 2 pm, supported by a poster campaign to increase awareness of the problem. The objective of these changes was to reduce prescribing errors by reducing warfarin prescriptions out-of-hours, by the on-call doctors. We repeated the <b>audit</b> <b>cycle</b> twice.

40|$|Background: Current {{evidence}} for optimal management of fetal nuchal cord detected after the head has birthed supports techniques that avoid ligation of {{the umbilical cord}} circulation. Routine audit found frequent unsafe management of nuchal cord by skilled birth attendants (SBAs) in migrant and refugee birth centres on the Thai-Burmese border. Method: The <b>audit</b> <b>cycle</b> was used to enhance safe practice by SBA for the fetus with nuchal cord. In the three birth centres the action phase of the <b>audit</b> <b>cycle</b> was initially {{carried out by the}} doctor responsible for the site. Six months later a registered midwife, present six days per week for three months in one birth facility, encouraged SBAs to facilitate birth with an intact umbilical circulation for nuchal cord. Rates of cord ligation before birth were recorded over a 24 month period (1 -July- 2011 to 30 -June- 2013) and in-depth interviews and a knowledge survey of the SBAs took place three months after the registered midwife departure. Results: The proportion of births with nuchal cord ligation declined significantly over the four six monthly quarters from 15. 9 % (178 / 1123) before the action phase of the audit cycle; to 11. 1 % (107 / 966) during the action phase of the <b>audit</b> <b>cycle</b> with the doctors; to 2. 4 % (28 / 1182) with the registered midwife; to 0. 9 % (9 / 999) from three to nine months after the departure of the registered midwife, (p < 0. 001, linear trend). Significant improvements in safe practice were observed at all three SMRU birth facilities. Knowledge of fetal nuchal cord amongst SBAs was sub-optimal and associated with fear and worry despite improved practice. The support of a registered midwife increased confidence of SBAs. Conclusion: The <b>audit</b> <b>cycle</b> and registered midwife interprofessional learning for SBAs led to a significant improvement in safe practice for the fetus with nuchal cord.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Adequate medical note keeping is {{critical}} in delivering high quality healthcare. However, there are few robust tools available for the auditing of notes. The aim {{of this paper was}} to describe the design, validation and implementation of a novel scoring tool to objectively assess surgical notes. METHODS An initial ‘path finding’ study was performed to evaluate the quality of note keeping using the CRABEL scoring tool. The findings prompted the development of the Surgical Tool for Auditing Records (STAR) as an alternative. STAR was validated using inter-rater reliability analysis. An <b>audit</b> <b>cycle</b> of surgical notes using STAR was performed. The results were analysed and a structured form for the completion of surgical notes was introduced to see if the quality improved in the next <b>audit</b> <b>cycle</b> using STAR. An education exercise was conducted and all participants said the exercise would change their practice, with 25 % implementing major changes. RESULTS Statistical analysis of STAR showed that it is reliable (Cronbach’s a = 0. 959). On completing the <b>audit</b> <b>cycle,</b> there was an overall increase in the STAR score from 83. 344 % to 97. 675 % (p< 0. 001) with significant improvements in the documentation of the initial clerking from 59. 0 % to 96. 5 % (p< 0. 001) and subsequent entries from 78. 4 % to 96. 1 % (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Clerking {{a patient}} is {{the first and most}} {{important}} contact that any medical team has with the patient. It provides information that may not be available later in the admission if recorded improperly, such as referral letters, collateral history, dosette boxes or prescription sheets. The quality of data recorded from this encounter was examined at a busy district general hospital surgical department. Initial measurement demonstrated that less than half of certain key parameters like dosages of medication were being recorded by clerking doctors. A clerking proforma was therefore designed to combat this problem. Over three <b>audit</b> <b>cycles</b> (n = 170, 150, 174) the proforma showed statistically significant improvements in the proportion of data that was captured at initial contact with the patient. We conclude that the introduction of proformas for clerking significantly improves the collection of data that impacts patient care during their hospital stay. Problem At the Medway Maritime Hospital, a district general hospital in Kent, UK, clerkings in the surgical department have traditionally been done on plain paper. An initial audit by the authors demonstrated that clerking standards were deficient. Key features like allergies were not being noted.

DESIGN [...] Implementation of an agreed audit protocol, with central analysis and feedback of anonymous and aggregated data by a medical audit advisory group. SETTING [...] All 147 Leicestershire practices. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Participation in the complete <b>audit</b> <b>cycle,</b> comparison of actual use of vitamin B- 12 injections with agreed criteria of use, and assessment of improvement in use. RESULTS [...] 264 general practitioners (55 % of all doctors from 49 % of all Leicestershire practices) completed both phases of the <b>audit</b> <b>cycle,</b> and 321 (67 %) completed phase 1 only. Twenty four (16 %) practices failed to participate from the outset, and a further 58 (35 %) dropped out at various stages. Only 10 of the 37 singlehanded practices completed the audit, although 34 initially agreed to participate. If singlehanded practices were excluded, 56 % (61) of practices completed both phases of the <b>audit</b> <b>cycle.</b> In total 1714 patients received B- 12 injections. Appropriate use increased from 62 % in phase 1 to 72 % in phase 2 of the audit; there was a 32 % {{reduction in the number}} of patients inappropriately receiving B- 12 (521 to 352), and the proportion of patients receiving B- 12 at the correct frequency rose from 58 % to 72 %.

The increase and uncertainty of oil prices has been a national cause for concern over the years and such it has adopted a national energy policy and has initiated various energy efficiency programmes. The purpose of this research is to evaluate one such programme, the Hospitals’ Energy Efficiency Programme (with emphasis on its design and implementation) using theory-based policy evaluation and provide suggestions for its improvements by looking to programmes in other countries. The key results of this study shows that while energy efficiency improvements have been achieved by the programme there are various failure factors which limits its effectiveness.

40|$|BACKGROUND Clinical audit is an {{intervention}} {{designed to improve}} the quality of clinical care. Although well established in high income countries, there is little research evidence for its effectiveness in resource poor settings. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES I aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of clinical audit in influencing clinical practice in providing diagnostic care for patients with suspected TB. METHODS A total of 26 health centres were recruited in total in Cuba, Peru and Bolivia. Clinical audit was introduced to improve the diagnostic care for patients attending with suspected TB. Standards were based on the WHO and TB programme guidelines relating to the appropriate use of microscopy, culture and radiological investigations. At least two <b>audit</b> <b>cycles</b> were completed over two years. Improvement was determined by comparing performance between two six-month periods pre-and-post intervention. Qualitative methods were used to ascertain facilitating and limiting contextual factors influencing change among health care professionals' clinical behaviour, following the introduction of clinical audit. RESULTS I found a significant improvement in 11 out of 13 standards in Cuba, two out of six in Bolivia and two out of five standards in Peru. Barriers to quality improvement included conflicting objectives for clinicians and TB programmes, poor coordination within the health system, and patients' expectations of illness and health services. CONCLUSIONS Clinical audit may drive improvements in the quality of clinical care in resource poor settings. It is likely to be more effective if integrated within local TB programmes.

Major improvements occurred in cholesterol control with the number of patients with cholesterol below 5 mmol/l improving from 29 % to 62 %. Aspirin prescribing is high with trends towards better control of blood pressure. Improvements in lifestyle advice given were also found. A positive outcome of the project was a reduction in hospital admissions from 32 % in the 1999 audit to 20 % in 2002. The project has benefited the Borders by introducing new ways of working across professional and organisational divides, and provided a foundation for the development of a management clinical network for CHD. The model developed has also allowed more rapid planning of a local project to implement the hypertension guidelines. The project has been awarded three national awards for its innovative approach to CHD...|$|R
