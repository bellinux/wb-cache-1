50|$|Three {{versions}} of the front suspension were installed in the cars (aside from the rubber-disc style used on the prototype). Cars #1001-1002 used <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> torsion tube design, which suffered from severe toe-in during heavy braking. Tucker then switched to <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> sandwich type suspension (with <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> block sandwiched between {{the upper and lower}} A-arms) on cars #1003-1025, however this type was severely stiff. Starting on car #1026, Tucker finally settled on a suspension design with {{a modified version of the}} rubber torsion tube with the toe-in braking problem corrected.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT：Ozone {{caused the}} crack {{on the surface}} of <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> article by {{oxidation}} of double bond at room temperature. Wax migrates to the surface of <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> article and makes a physical barrier to prevent process of ozonation. We investigated change of molecular weight distribution of waxes in unfilled NR, SBR, and BR vulcanizates before and after aging at room temperature for 6 months. Migration and evaporation behaviors of wax in <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> article at ambient conditions help understand a role of wax as an antidegradant and appearance contamination of <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> article. The relative intensity distribution of n-alkanes of the NR specimen after the aging was shifted to higher molecular weight compared with the relative intensity distribution before the aging, while those of the SBR specimen before and after the aging did not show a big difference...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{effective}} circuit training program for increasing health using <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> tube. Five healthy middle-aged and elderly women（ 68 ± 4 years old） and seven female college students（ 21 ± 1 years old）performed circuit training using an oil pressure-type machine for about 2 months. In addition, 11 healthy middle-aged and elderly women（ 61 ± 9 years old）and eight healthy female college students（ 21 ± 1 years old）performed circuit training using <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> tube for about 3 months which included undertaking their heart rate and energy consumption. Furthermore, the subjects who performed circuit training using <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> tube, performed <b>a</b> physical fitness test before and after training periods. In the results, the energy consumption in the circuit training using <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> tube was at the same level as the energy consumption with the circuit training using the machine by middle- aged and elderly women. After training intervention, the sit-up test and chair-stand test were significantly improved. Therefore, in muscular endurance and the muscular strength of lower limbs, it was suggested that the circuit training using <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> tube was effective for increases of the physical strength...|$|R
