5|$|Operation <b>Aquatint</b> was the codename for {{a failed}} raid by British Commandos {{on the coast}} of {{occupied}} France during the Second World War. The raid was undertaken in September 1942 on part of what later became Omaha Beach by No. 62 Commando, also known as the Small Scale Raiding Force.|$|E
5|$|The 57 raids {{were all}} between 1940 and 1944 and were mostly against targets in France, which had 36 raids. There were 12 raids in Norway, seven raids in the Channel Islands and one each in Belgium and the Netherlands. The raids {{met with a}} mixture of fortunes. Operation Chariot—the raid against dock {{installations}} at Saint-Nazaire—has since been called the greatest raid of all. Others, like Operation <b>Aquatint</b> and Operation Musketoon, resulted in the capture or death of all the commandos involved.|$|E
5|$|March-Phillipps {{was killed}} during Operation <b>Aquatint</b> in September 1942. On the same mission, Hayes evaded capture {{and crossed the}} Spanish border, only {{to be handed over}} to the Germans who kept him in solitary {{confinement}} for nine months before he was executed by firing squad on 13 July 1943. Appleyard later joined the Special Air Service, and {{on the same day that}} Hayes was executed Appleyard was reported missing when his plane failed to return from a mission. Lassen would also join the Special Air Service; he was awarded two bars to his MC and promoted to major before receiving a posthumous Victoria Cross in Italy in 1945.|$|E
5000|$|Protective {{respirators}} {{and masks}} should have particle filters, particularly for <b>aquatinting.</b> As {{a part of}} the <b>aquatinting</b> process, a printmaker is often exposed to rosin powder. Rosin is a serious health hazard, especially to printmakers who, in the past, simply used to hold their breath [...] using an <b>aquatinting</b> booth.|$|R
50|$|In the 1830s {{and early}} 1840s he {{produced}} a series of <b>aquatints</b> of topographical views, both from his own paintings and those of others. They were issued as individual prints. He painted a series of four pictures of Niagara Falls, which were published as large <b>aquatints,</b> two of which he etched himself.|$|R
50|$|In 1779 his {{prints were}} {{exhibited}} in Bern {{but the book}} failed to sell. Wagner received help from a Swiss army officer in Dutch service and in 1785 thirty <b>aquatints</b> were published in Amsterdam. Till 1948 ninety of these <b>aquatints</b> were exhibited in Keukenhof Castle, but sold. Today these works {{can be seen in}} the Kunsthaus in Aarau.|$|R
5|$|The Dieppe raid in August 1942 {{had changed}} the German {{fortification}} plans; {{the success of the}} German defences in repelling the raid reinforced the importance of the Atlantic wall. The Organization Todt had now started to reinforce gun emplacements with infantry strong points along the French coastline. The older gun emplacements based on First World War designs were being replaced by stronger designs with overhead cover to offer protection from air attack. The area of Normandy targeted by Operation <b>Aquatint</b> had yet to receive any concrete gun emplacements but there was a network of coastal artillery batteries able to provide interlocking arcs of fire. German infantry carried out foot patrols in the areas between the batteries.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a request}} from the Chief of Combined Operations Admiral Louis Mountbatten for probes of German coastal defences, No. 62 Commando, {{also known as the}} Small Scale Raiding Force (SSRF), mounted a number of {{operations}} in 1942. The first three missions were complete successes: Operation Barricade (14/15 August 1942), Operation Dryad, (2/3 September 1942), and Operation Pound (7/8 September 1942). <b>Aquatint</b> was planned for a night in mid September 1942 as a reconnaissance mission near Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes, a small coastal town near Port en Bessin in Normandy. The mission was to collect information about the surrounding area, and take a German guard prisoner. Aerial reconnaissance had identified a small group of houses on the seafront thought to be occupied by Germans.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} raiding force {{depended}} on the objective. The smallest raid was conducted by two men from No. 6 Commando in Operation J V. The largest was the 10,500 man Operation Jubilee. Most of the raids were scheduled to only last overnight although some, like Operation Gauntlet, were conducted {{over a number of}} days. In north west Europe there were 57 raids made between 1940 and 1944. Of these 36 were against targets in France. There were 12 raids against Norway, seven raids in the Channel Islands, and single raids were made in Belgium and the Netherlands. The success of the raids varied; Operation Chariot, the raid against dock installations at St Nazaire, has been hailed as the greatest raid of all time, but others, like Operation <b>Aquatint</b> and Operation Musketoon, resulted in the capture or death of all involved. The smaller raids ended in mid-1944 on the orders of Major General Robert Laycock, who suggested that they were no longer as effective and only resulted in the Germans strengthening their beach defences, something that could be extremely detrimental to Allied plans.|$|E
5000|$|Picasso learnt new {{techniques}} of etching during the suite, from relatively simple line etchings, through dry point and <b>aquatinting</b> and sugar <b>aquatinting,</b> this {{enabled him to}} achieve more painterly effects. [...] Most of the prints were completed to Picasso's satisfaction in a single state, but others, especially the erotic compositions, exist in several states, fourteen in one case.|$|R

25|$|In 1774, Gainsborough and {{his family}} moved to London to live in Schomberg House, Pall Mall. A {{commemorative}} blue plaque was put on the house in 1951. In 1777, he again began to exhibit his paintings at the Royal Academy, including portraits of contemporary celebrities, such as the Duke and Duchess of Cumberland. Exhibitions of his work continued for the next six years. About this time, Gainsborough began experimenting with printmaking using the then-novel techniques of <b>aquatint</b> and soft-ground etching.|$|E

25|$|Between the births of {{her sons}} – Hans in 1892 and Peter in 1896 – Kollwitz saw a {{performance}} of Gerhart Hauptmann's The Weavers, which dramatized the oppression of the Silesian weavers in Langenbielau and their failed revolt in 1844. Inspired, the artist ceased work {{on a series of}} etchings she had intended to illustrate Émile Zola's Germinal, and produced a cycle of six works on the weavers theme, three lithographs (Poverty, Death, and Conspiracy) and three etchings with <b>aquatint</b> and sandpaper (March of the Weavers, Riot, and The End). Not a literal illustration of the drama, the works were a free and naturalistic expression of the workers' misery, hope, courage, and eventually, doom.|$|E
25|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, {{artists such as}} Hale were {{instrumental}} in reviving etching in America and Europe and restoring {{the significance of this}} technical medium. At the forefront of the Etching Revival of Hale's time was artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler, who set the standard for new generation of etchers. Clements first introduced Hale to etching while the pair was traveling in Europe. In terms of the etching process, Hale, like her contemporaries, used copper plates to produce clean, well-defined impressions. Hale experimented with a variety of etching techniques, including hard-ground, soft-ground, <b>aquatint,</b> and color inking. In the etching medium, Hale worked on a more intimate basis, using etchings to document her travels through the U.S., Europe, and the Middle East. Some of Hale’s most accomplished prints include The Willow Whistle, which was produced using hard-ground etching and displayed at the Paris Salon, and First Night in Venice, which used the soft-ground process.|$|E
25|$|Hyperion {{remained}} {{important as}} a cultural symbol within the Romanian diaspora, which had published its first edition. In the late 1940s, Eliade and Virgil Ierunca founded their own Luceafărul as an anti-communist journal in Paris. Another exile, Paul Celan, reportedly introduced his Austrian friend Ingeborg Bachmann, to Eminescu's poem—its core themes were discovered by critics in Bachmann's novel Malina (1971). Luceafărul also had a cult readership among the Romanians of the Moldavian SSR, where, in 1974, Gheorghe Vrabie contributed a set of illustrations in <b>aquatint</b> and eau-forte. The Soviet republic also hosted a Luceafărul Theatre and produced a feature film of the same name, directed by Emil Loteanu. Starring Vasile Zubcu-Codreanu in the title role, it is famous as the only Eminescu biopic. In 1983, the poem also inspired Loteanu to write the script for a ballet, with music by Eugen Doga. Alexa Ispas, a Romanian expatriate in Scotland, adapted the poem into a theatrical play, performed in English at Govanhill Baths (2014).|$|E

50|$|In 1788 he {{published}} {{a set of}} four views of St. Albans, drawn and etched by himself and <b>aquatinted</b> by Jukes. In 1791 Schnebbelie commenced {{the publication of the}} Antiquaries' Museum, illustrating the ancient architecture, painting, and sculpture of Great Britain, a series of plates etched and <b>aquatinted</b> by himself; but he lived to complete only three parts. The work was continued by his friends, Richard Gough and John Nichols, and issued as a volume, with a memoir of him, in 1800. He was also associated with James Moore and J. G. Parkyns in the production of their Monastic Remains, 1791, his name appearing as the publisher on some of the plates. A view of the Serpentine River, Hyde Park, etched by Schnebbelie in 1787, was <b>aquatinted</b> by Francis Jukes and published in 1796.|$|R

25|$|He {{was born}} in Chelsea, London. His father, a native of Lanark, {{had served as a}} soldier, losing an arm at the Battle of Fontenoy, and was admitted, first as an inmate, and {{afterwards}} as an outdoor pensioner, at Chelsea Hospital. Gillray commenced life by learning letter-engraving, at which he soon became adept. This employment, however, proved irksome to James, so he wandered about for a time with a company of strolling players. After a very checkered experience, he returned to London and was admitted as a student in the Royal Academy, supporting himself by engraving, and probably issuing a considerable number of caricatures under fictitious names. His caricatures are almost all in etching, some also with <b>aquatint,</b> and a few using stipple technique. None can correctly be described as engravings, although this term is often loosely used to describe them. Hogarth's works were the delight and study of his early years. Paddy on Horseback, which appeared in 1779, is the first caricature which is certainly his. Two caricatures on Admiral Rodney's naval victory at the Battle of the Saintes, issued in 1782, were among the first of the memorable series of his political sketches.|$|E
25|$|Kollwitz's {{second major}} cycle of works was the Peasant War, which, subject to many {{preliminary}} drawings and discarded ideas in lithography, occupied her from 1902 to 1908. The German Peasants' War was a violent revolution {{which took place}} in Southern Germany {{in the early years of}} the Reformation, beginning in 1525; peasants who had been treated as slaves took arms against feudal lords and the church. As was The Weavers, this subject, too, might have been suggested by a Hauptmann drama, Florian Geyer. However, the initial source of Kollwitz's interest dated to her youth, when she and her brother Konrad playfully imagined themselves as barricade fighters in a revolution. The artist identified with the character of Black Anna, a woman cited as a protagonist in the uprising. When completed, the Peasant War consisted of pieces in etching, <b>aquatint,</b> and soft ground: Plowing, Raped, Sharpening the Scythe, Arming in the Vault, Outbreak, After the Battle (which, eerily premonitory, features a mother searching through corpses in the night, looking for her son), and The Prisoners. In all, the works were technically more impressive than those of The Weavers, owing to their greater size and dramatic command of light and shadow. They are Kollwitz's highest achievements as an etcher.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to these projects {{and in the middle}} of his Shakespeare undertaking Boydell experimented with <b>aquatint</b> in An History of the River Thames, published in 1796. Bruntjen writes, [...] "although not the first colored <b>aquatint</b> book, [...] was the first major one, and it was to set an example for the type of illustration that was to enjoy widespread popularity in England for some forty years". Boydell also published The Original Work of William Hogarth in 1790 and The Poetical Works of John Milton and The Life of the Poet (i.e., Milton) in 1794.|$|E
500|$|In 1788, Charles Catton the younger, {{who did not}} {{accompany}} any of voyages, depicted an <b>aquatint</b> engraving of an [...] "Otaheite Dog" [...] in {{his book}} [...] Based on its appearance and description, it may actually been a kurī instead.|$|E
500|$|The folio and the {{illustrated}} Shakespeare edition were [...] "by far {{the largest}} single engraving enterprise ever undertaken in England". As print collector and dealer Christopher Lennox-Boyd explains, [...] "had there not been a market for such engravings, {{not one of the}} paintings would have been commissioned, and few, if any, of the artists would have risked painting such elaborate compositions". Scholars believe that a variety of engraving methods were employed and that line engraving was the [...] "preferred medium" [...] because it was [...] "clear and hardwearing" [...] and because it had a high reputation. Stipple engraving, which was quicker and often used to produce shading effects, wore out quicker and was valued less. Many plates were a mixture of both. Several scholars have suggested that mezzotint and <b>aquatint</b> were also used. Lennox-Boyd, however, claims that [...] "close examination of the plates confirms" [...] that these two methods were not used and argues that they were [...] "totally unsuitable": [...] mezzotint wore quickly and <b>aquatint</b> was too new (there would not have been enough artists capable of executing it). Most of Boydell's engravers were also trained artists; for example, Bartolozzi was renowned for his stippling technique.|$|E
