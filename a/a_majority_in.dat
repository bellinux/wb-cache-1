Any amendment to the Constitution must first be passed by <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> {{each of the two}} legislative houses. The proposed amendment must then be held over for consideration by the succeeding elected legislature, where it must again be passed by <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> each house. The amendment then goes on the general ballot and becomes enacted into the Constitution if approved by a majority of the voters.|$|E
5|$|Because Justice Anthony Kennedy did {{not join}} Stevens' opinion as to several parts, largely {{on the grounds of}} {{judicial}} parsimony (that is, having decided that the military commissions had no foundation, the core question of the case was decided and the Court did not need to go further), those sections were without <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> support.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{was able}} to criticise Kosygin by {{contrasting}} him with Vladimir Lenin, whom Brezhnev {{claimed to have been}} more interested in improving the conditions of Soviet agriculture than improving the quality of light industrial goods. Kosygin's support for producing more consumer goods was also criticised by Brezhnev, and his supporters, most notably Konstantin Chernenko, for being a return to quasi First World policies. At the 23rd Party Congress Kosygin's position was weakened when Brezhnev's supporters were able to increase expenditure on defence and agriculture. However, Brezhnev did not have <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the Politburo, and could count on only four votes. In the Politburo Kosygin could count on Kiril Mazurov's vote, and when Kosygin and Podgorny were not bickering with each other, they actually had <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the Politburo over Brezhnev. Unfortunately for Kosygin this was not often the case, and Kosygin and Podgorny were constantly disagreeing on policy.|$|E
