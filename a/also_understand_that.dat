25|$|Here, {{one should}} <b>also</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> an evil {{suggestion}} {{is the starting}} point of evil act. When it affects a careless or heedless person, it creates in him a desire for evil. Then, further whisperings change the evil desire into an evil intention and evil purpose. When the evil suggestion grows in intensity, the intention becomes a resolution, which then culminates in the evil act. Therefore, the meaning of seeking God's refuge from the evil of the whisperer is that God should nip the evil in the bud.|$|E

500|$|Churches of Christ have {{historically}} {{had the most}} conservative position on baptism among the various branches of the Restoration Movement, understanding baptism by immersion to be {{a necessary part of}} conversion. [...] The most significant disagreements concerned {{the extent to which a}} correct understanding of the role of baptism is necessary for its validity. [...] David Lipscomb consistently argued that if a believer was baptized out of a desire to obey God, the baptism was valid, even if the individual did not fully understand the role baptism plays in salvation. [...] Austin McGary argued strongly that to be valid, the convert must <b>also</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> baptism is for the forgiveness of sins. [...] McGary's view became the prevailing one in the early 20th century, but the approach advocated by Lipscomb never totally disappeared. [...] More recently, the rise of the International Churches of Christ, who [...] "reimmersed some who came into their fellowship, even those previously immersed 'for remission of sins' in a Church of Christ," [...] has caused some to reexamine the question of rebaptism.|$|E
500|$|PedroII was {{hard-working}} and {{his routine}} was demanding. He usually {{woke up at}} 07:00 and did not sleep before 02:00 in the morning. His entire day was devoted to the affairs of state and the meager free time available was spent reading and studying. The Emperor went about his daily routine dressed in a simple black tail coat, trousers, and cravat. For special occasions he would wear court dress, and he only appeared in full regalia with crown, mantle and scepter twice each year at the opening and closing of the General Assembly. PedroII held politicians and government officials to the strict standards which he exemplified. The Emperor adopted a strict policy for the selection of civil servants based on morality and merit. To set the standard, he lived simply, once having said: [...] "I <b>also</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> useless expenditure {{is the same as}} stealing from the Nation." [...] Balls and assemblies of the Court ceased after 1852. He also refused to request or allow the amount of his civil list of Rs 800:000$000 per year (U.S. $405,000 or £90,000 in 1840) to be raised from the declaration of his majority until his dethronement almost fifty years later.|$|E
500|$|Use of the Saltire at sea as a Jack or {{courtesy}} flag has been observed, including as a Jack on the Scottish Government's Marine Partrol Vessel (MPV) Jura. [...] The ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne routinely flies the Saltire as a Jack on vessels {{which have a}} bow staff, including when such vessels are underway. This practice has also been observed on the Paddle Steamer Waverley when operating {{in and around the}} Firth of Clyde. The practice of maritime vessels adopting the Saltire, for use as a jack or {{courtesy flag}}, may lead to possible confusion in that the Saltire closely resembles the maritime signal flag M, [...] "MIKE", which is used to indicate [...] "My vessel is stopped; making no way." [...] Obviously mariners who understand this signal code <b>also</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> the saltire is displayed on the jackstaff and not as a signal. For the benefit of Scottish seafarers wishing to display a Scottish flag other than the Saltire, thereby avoiding confusion and a possible fine, a campaign was launched in November 2007 seeking official recognition for the historic Scottish Red Ensign. Despite having last been used officially by the pre-Union Royal Scots Navy and merchant marine fleets in the 18th century, the flag continues to be produced by flag manufacturers and its unofficial use by private citizens on water has been observed.|$|E

2500|$|The West must <b>also</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> Western {{institutions}} {{cannot be}} transplanted into a social context {{for which they}} were not defined. Western observers also must understand that even fair elections, if the elected government cannot close gaps, are moot. The elites, therefore, need to envision the form of legitimacy that works in their culture. Many Asian societies, for example, are more concerned with common social goals than Western individualism. When the problem is radical Islam, the West must reinforce local reform efforts and avoid being seen as meddling in countries’ internal affairs by supporting secular over religious Islamists, driving reform from the outside, or trying to change the Islamic character of Islamic countries." ...|$|E

He is a very warm partisan, and openly and actively opposed to the election of General Taylor.

Whether this is true the records of the department will show. I may add that the Whigs here almost universally desire his removal.|$|E

60|$|I am perplexed {{to picture}} to myself {{the state of}} mind which accepts these verbal juggleries. It is intelligible that the Creator should operate {{according}} to such rules as he might think fit to lay down for himself (and therefore according to law); but that would leave the operation of his will just as much a direct personal act {{as it would be}} under any other circumstances. I can <b>also</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> (as in Leibnitz's caricature of Newton's views) the Creator might have made the cosmical machine, and, after setting it going, have left it to itself till it needed repair. But then, by the supposition, his personal responsibility would have been involved in all that it did; just as much as a dynamiter is responsible for what happens, when he has set his machine going and left it to explode.|$|E
60|$|It is useless. I cannot {{struggle}} against the inevitable. I have been faithful to Mr. Hale and have worked hard. Why my faithfulness should have been thus rewarded I cannot understand. Yet I cannot be false to my trust, nor break my word by compromising. Still, I have resolved that no more deaths shall be upon my head. I have willed the many millions I lately received to their rightful owners. Let the stalwart sons of Eben Hale work out their own salvation. Ere you read this I shall have passed on. The Minions of Midas are all-powerful. The police are impotent. I have learned from them that other millionnaires have been likewise mulcted or persecuted--how many is not known, for when one yields to the M. of M., his mouth is thenceforth sealed. Those who have not yielded are even now reaping their scarlet harvest. The grim game is being played out. The Federal Government can do nothing. I <b>also</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe. Society is shaken to its foundations. Principalities and powers are as brands ripe for the burning. Instead of the masses against the classes, it is a class against the classes. We, the guardians of human progress, are being singled out and struck down. Law and order have failed.|$|E

60|$|But again, As by {{the names}} of the twelve tribes written on the gates, we may see what {{encouragement}} the Jews will have, at their return, to enter in at them; so we may <b>also</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> by {{the names of}} the twelve tribes here written, God would have us to perceive how all must be qualified that from among the Gentiles at this day do enter in at these gates; namely, those, and those only, that be cut out of their own wild olive tree, and transplanted among the children of Israel, into their good olive tree. Such as are Jews inwardly, the Israel of God, according to the new creature, they shall enter, for the holy Gentiles also, by virtue of their conversion, are styled the children of Abraham, Jews, the chosen generation, the peculiar people, the holy nation; and so are spiritually, though not naturally by carnal generation, of the twelve tribes whose names are written upon the gates of the city (Gal 3:7; Rom 2:28; 1 Peter 2:9,10). 'And it shall come to pass,' saith the prophet, 'that in what tribe the stranger,' that is, the Gentile 'sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord God' (Eze 47:23). Thus the Jews and Gentiles shall meet together {{in the spirit of the}} gospel, and so both become a righteous nation; to both which the gates of this city shall stand continually open; at which also they may with boldness demand, by the faith of the Lord Jesus, their entrance, both for communion with the God, grace, and privileges of this city, according to that which is written, 'Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in' (Isa 26:2). Thus much of the number of the gates, and now to proceed to the order of them.|$|E
