40|$|This project {{develops}} strategic {{recommendations for}} the growth of the Eaglepicher (EP) Medical Energy Products (MEP) group - a battery supplier to Implantable Medical Device (IMD) manufacturers. The analysis evaluates the <b>key</b> external <b>competitive</b> <b>forces</b> of the battery industry and finds the IMD market to be most attractive. The internal characteristics of the firm are examined using industry benchmarking and a value chain analysis. The current strategy is examined by integrating the external and internal analyses, and a rationale for future strategy is developed. A balanced scorecard approach is utilized to evaluate market alternatives using EP 2 ̆ 7 s decision-making criteria. This leads to the key market level recommendation of pursuing the neurostimulator market segment within the IMD industry. At the business level, the MEP group is constrained by cash flow, so it is recommended that EP seek a source of external financing to facilitate pursuit of this market segment...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to develop a}} strategic recommendation for market entry of the Client 2 ̆ 7 s new software product based on a breakthrough predictive-decoding technology. The analysis examines videoconferencing market and reveals that there is a strong demand for the software products that can reduce delays in interactive video communications while maintaining reasonable video quality. The evaluation of the <b>key</b> external <b>competitive</b> <b>forces</b> suggests that the market has low intensity of competition and high potential of profitability for the new software. A resource inventory is utilized to assess the Client 2 ̆ 7 s internal characteristics. Considering the Client 2 ̆ 7 s strengths and weaknesses, it is recommended that the Client applies for intellectual property rights over the new technology to facilitate product differentiation, and seeks partnerships with its customers for achieving fast time-to-market and reducing the business start-up costs...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine <b>key</b> issues and <b>competitive</b> <b>forces</b> that will affect the {{conventions}} and meetings industry in two key markets, Australia and the United Kingdom, in the next 5 years. Using the Delphi technique, the study seeks to explore key issues that the industry in the two countries has to address to ensure its continued growth and competitiveness, as well as major <b>competitive</b> <b>forces</b> that may challenge their respective positions. The results of the Delphi surveys indicate that Australia and the United Kingdom face a number of similar issues relating to marketing, investment/infrastructure, human resources, and service quality. The <b>competitive</b> <b>forces</b> identified relate to specific countries: in the case of Australia, this was the Asian countries, specifically Singapore and Hong Kong; and for the United Kingdom, European destinations and specifically Ireland. Similarities and differences between the two markets are discussed, and a number of conclusions drawn. School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. Using {{the case}} of an {{environmental}} monitoring service envisaged by the South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON), this research represents a comprehensive systematic approach to strategising for and justifying the adoption and implementation of a technical service by a public entity. The conceptual design of the research followed the strategic triangle for public management. Strategic analyses applied the Internal-Market-External (IME) model to understand the current and future business contexts of SAEON. Schemas for a generic business cycle and a value chain for the environmental research sector were developed. These new schemas aided strategic thinking about environmental research as a line of work within the public sector. Key findings were that competition is prevalent in the publicfunded environmental research sector and the <b>key</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>force</b> driving the sector is the availability of resources, which is largely determined by political financiers. A survey of the potential market has provided sufficient evidence that a market for environmental monitoring services does exist. This market was described in terms of market segmentation, drivers of decision-making, specific requirements of service providers, perceptions about current service providers and preferences for the type of service provider organisation. The results of the survey elucidated the public value and legitimacy of an environmental monitoring service and should have meaning beyond just South Africa {{in the context of the}} International Long-Term Ecological Research Network (ILTER). Analyses of the external environment of the proposed service confirmed that rising environmental pressures and uncertainty are globally concerning governments, society and the business sector. Since the service will eventually have to be fully paid for, the most powerful <b>competitive</b> <b>force</b> will be the clients. Conversely to the high competition of the public funded environmental research sector, current market failure was identified in the environmental monitoring services market since all the market segments expressed their general dissatisfaction with the services they received from a range of service provider categories. This leaves the door wide open for SAEON to enter the environmental monitoring market legitimately to deliver on the market’s expectations as a form of Blue Ocean Strategy in the public sector. The research found that the service will be an extension of SAEON’s core competencies, but should apply a low-cost strategy. Application of business tools such as business model design and key success factors provided clear guidelines on how the service should be implemented. Evidence was found that key theoretical constructs and management tools abstracted from commercial enterprises may be usefully applied, either individually or in combination, in the context of the public sector, albeit with some modification. The research demonstrated how core business tools such as the Five <b>Competitive</b> <b>Forces,</b> the Balanced Scorecard and Strategy Mapping can be made amenable to the public sector by replacing ‘profitability’ with ‘public value’ as the key objective for a public entity...|$|R

Competitive advantages {{provide the framework for}} assessing strategy and understanding the source of competitive advantage. This paper applies Porter Five Forces Model to identify the positioning of competitive advantages of plywood industry in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Qualitative research was carried out using in-depth interview method. The interview contained the sequence of statements that were grouped into five categories (threat of new entrants, bargaining power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, threat of substitutes and rivalry among existing competitors), and each category represented one <b>competitive</b> <b>force.</b> A structured questionnaire from Agricultural Innovation & Commercialization Centre (AICC) was used to identify five <b>competitive</b> <b>forces</b> that shape the company. Secondary data and literature study are also used to identify the <b>competitive</b> <b>forces.</b> The analysis of five forces indicates that entry barriers of the industry are high and low competitive of plywood substitutes.

40|$|Increasingly, {{technological}} innovation {{results from the}} joint creation effort of different players in the value chain, such as suppliers, customers, research centres and universities. Balancing co-operative and <b>competitive</b> <b>forces</b> in the innovation process to co-create value and to capture part of this value has become crucial to profit from innovation. In this article, we show that this tension between value creation and value capture is present in each R&D project. Drawing {{on the case of}} STMicroelectronics, we show that the balance of co-operative and <b>competitive</b> <b>forces</b> in R&D projects is made through the careful alignment of three variables: project knowledge attributes, project governance structure (internal development, co-operation or contracting), and project partner selection (firm or university). The capability to match these three elements explains the success of the innovation process of STMicroelectronics. Building on the experience of this firm, we provide some practical guidance on how managers should trade off these co-operative and <b>competitive</b> <b>forces</b> in organising their R&D projects...|$|R
