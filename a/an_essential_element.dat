5|$|A {{genome-wide}} association {{study of}} more than 100,000 human individuals identified variants of the gene KLB, which encodes the transmembrane protein β-Klotho, as highly associated with alcohol consumption. The protein β-Klotho is <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> in cell surface receptors for hormones involved in modulation of appetites for simple sugars and alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is {{not thought}} to be <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> for any living organism. Some complex organic {{germanium}} compounds are being investigated as possible pharmaceuticals, though none have yet proven successful. Similar to silicon and aluminum, natural germanium compounds tend to be insoluble in water and thus have little oral toxicity. However, synthetic soluble germanium salts are nephrotoxic, and synthetic chemically reactive germanium compounds with halogens and hydrogen are irritants and toxins.|$|E

5|$|Sodium is <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> for {{all animals}} and some plants. Sodium ions {{are the major}} cation in the {{extracellular}} fluid (ECF) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF osmotic pressure and ECF compartment volume. Loss {{of water from the}} ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration, a condition called hypernatremia. Isotonic loss of water and sodium from the ECF compartment decreases the size of that compartment in a condition called ECF hypovolemia.|$|E

5|$|Cobalt is <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> {{for life}} in minute amounts. The LD50 value for soluble cobalt salts has been {{estimated}} to be between 150 and 500mg/kg. In the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has designated a permissible exposure limit (PEL) in the workplace as a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1mg/m3. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.05mg/m3, time-weighted average. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 20mg/m3.|$|E

5|$|Risk is <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> in {{the battle}} system. A Risk bar is placed below the HP and MP bar, {{representing}} the Risk Points the player has accumulated. Risk Points affect Ashley's concentration; the longer Ashley attacks a target, the more his Risk Point accumulates — lowering his accuracy and defenses. Chain and Defensive Abilities increase Risk faster than regular attacks, while Break Arts do not increase Risk at all. Enemy attacks and spells deal more damage if the player has high Risk. The advantage, however, is the higher chances for the player to score critical hits and restore higher HP.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Apogee, Jackson {{entered into}} {{a joint venture with}} Clair Brothers to design a digital {{loudspeaker}} controller for control of complex concert sound systems. Jackson estimated that the project would cost $800,000 in U.S. dollars, but it ended up costing Clair Brothers more than $2M. From the same garage in which he started Apogee, Jackson developed the proprietary Clair iO: a two-input, six-output digital audio matrix with opto-isolated output circuits. <b>An</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> of the system was its ability to be controlled by wireless tablet computer by an audio engineer walking around to various seating sections in a concert venue, to tailor the system's response more precisely.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> for the band’s {{image is}} the Slipknot logo. The nonagram {{was created by}} the band’s members around the same time the band was founded. The nonagram is arguably the best-known sigil of Slipknot and it {{represents}} a 9 point star – a symbol of unity, loyalty, friendship and remembrance. The logo is composed of three equilateral triangles each rotated at 0, 40, and 80 degrees. Each star point was meant to stand for each of the nine members of the original band. Despite popular belief, the nonagram is not a Satanist symbol, nor does it reflect something perverted, evil, unclean or sadistic. On the contrary, just as the band has officially declared on various occasions, the nonagram marks the unbreakable bond between its members. Chris Fehn is one of the band’s members who has a nonagram tattoo.|$|E

5|$|Calcium is <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> {{needed in}} large quantities. The Ca2+ ion {{acts as an}} {{electrolyte}} and {{is vital to the}} health of the muscular, circulatory, and digestive systems; is indispensable to the building of bone; and supports synthesis and function of blood cells. For example, it regulates the contraction of muscles, nerve conduction, and the clotting of blood. As a result, intra- and extracellular calcium levels are tightly regulated by the body. Calcium can play this role because the Ca2+ ion forms stable coordination complexes with many organic compounds, especially proteins; it also forms compounds with a wide range of solubilities, enabling the formation of skeletons.|$|E
5|$|Players {{are able}} to move around the {{battlefield}} freely, but they {{have the option to}} create predefined paths for the character to follow. While moving along these paths, characters gain access to Hero actions, which make them immune to damage and speed up charge times. However, the use of these Hero actions requires the use of Bezels; these items are <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> in battle and are recharged through a variety of methods, such as destroying portions of an enemy's weapons and armor, or killing an enemy. Characters using Hero actions can attack while jumping in the air, and are also able to unleash special attacks which manifest as stylish firearm maneuvers. Enemies are only able to move while the player's current character is moving and will usually attack only that character.|$|E
5|$|Iodine is <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> {{for life}} and is the {{heaviest}} element commonly needed by living organisms. (Lanthanum and the other lanthanides, as well as tungsten, are used by a few microorganisms.) It {{is required for the}} synthesis of the growth-regulating thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine (T4 and T3 respectively, named after their number of iodine atoms). A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T3 and T4 and a concomitant enlargement of the thyroid tissue in an attempt to obtain more iodine, causing the disease known as simple goitre. The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4), which has a longer half-life than T3. In humans, the ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is between 14:1 and 20:1. T4 is converted to the active T3 (three to four times more potent than T4) within cells by deiodinases (5'-iodinase). These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine (T1a) and thyronamine (T0a'). All three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium-containing enzymes; thus dietary selenium is essential for T3 production.|$|E

50|$|Assam is {{acknowledged}} as the settling {{land for a}} lot of civilizations. A number of tribal grouping have landed in the soils of Assam in the course of diverse directions as the territory was linked to a number of states and many different countries. Australoids, Tibeto-Burmans, Indo-Aryans had been the most important traditional groups that arrived at the site and lived in the very old Assam. They were well thought-out as the ‘aborigines’ of Assam and yet at the moment they are <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> of the “Assamese Diaspora”.|$|R
5|$|The Egyptians {{believed}} that a balanced relationship between people and animals was <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> of the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants {{were believed to be}} members of a single whole. Animals, both domesticated and wild, were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. Poultry, such as ducks, geese, and pigeons, were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them. The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, and provided both honey and wax.|$|E
5|$|The tax was {{rescinded}} by the British in 1812, {{who then}} imposed a British style constitution on the island. One legal innovation {{of this time}} of particular consequence for the aristocracy was that creditors, who had previously only been able to enforce repayments of the interest on a loan or mortgage, could now seize property. Property began to change hands in smaller parcels at auctions, and consequently a land-owning bourgeoisie immediately began to flourish. Revolts against the Bourbons in 1821, and 1848 divided the nobility, and liberalism was in the air. These factors coupled with {{the social and political}} upheaval of the following Risorgimento in the 19th century meant the Sicilian aristocracy was a doomed class. Furthermore, because of their neglect and dereliction of noblesse oblige, <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> of the feudal system, the countryside was often ruled by bandits outside the enclosed villages, and the once grand country villas were decaying. The building mania of the Sicilian upper class was over.|$|E
5|$|Unlike its {{neighbours}} in the halogen column (chlorine and iodine), bromine is {{not known}} to have a confirmed biological role in humans. A single 2014 study suggests {{that it may be}} a necessary catalyst to make collagen IV, making it essential to basement membrane architecture and tissue development, but these findings have not been confirmed and the precise role posited for bromine is not certain. Aside from this, only circumstantial evidence in the form of hypothesised deprivation symptoms exists for a trace role for bromine. Nevertheless, even if bromine is not <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>element,</b> it can be pharmacologically beneficial. For example, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, formed by the eosinophil, and either chloride or bromide ions, eosinophil peroxidase provides a potent mechanism by which eosinophils kill multicellular parasites (such as, for example, the nematode worms involved in filariasis) and some bacteria (such as tuberculosis bacteria). Eosinophil peroxidase is a haloperoxidase that preferentially uses bromide over chloride for this purpose, generating hypobromite (hypobromous acid), although the use of chloride is possible.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} side of the world, maize seeds from the Americas were {{introduced}} into Southeast Asia in the late 16th century through Spanish and Portuguese traders. The plant thrived in the tropical climate of Indonesia, and soon became a staple food plant in drier areas of central and southeastern Indonesia, since it requires much less water than wet rice. Coconut and palm oil have been <b>a</b> <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> of Indonesian cuisine for centuries. The deep fried technique using palm oil was probably borrowed from Portuguese colonists; and Indonesia has its own type of corn fritter, called perkedel jagung or bakwan jagung.|$|R
