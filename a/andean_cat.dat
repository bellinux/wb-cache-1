50|$|In 2002 {{the status}} of the <b>Andean</b> <b>cat</b> was moved from Vulnerable to Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Due to the Andean cat's habitat being spread across four countries, {{biologists}} have attempted to collaborate in efforts to protect the species. One of the groups formed was the <b>Andean</b> <b>Cat</b> Conservation Committee, now known as the <b>Andean</b> <b>Cat</b> Alliance. The table below was taken directly from the most current strategy plan for 2011-2016.|$|E
50|$|Sanderson {{is still}} {{involved}} with the <b>Andean</b> <b>cat.</b> Together with Constanza Napolitano, Lilian Villalba, and Eliseo Delgado {{and others in the}} <b>Andean</b> <b>Cat</b> Alliance, the Small Cat Conservation Alliance has forged conservation agreements with Fundación Biodiversitas, a Chilean non-profit organization, and CONAF, the government agency responsible for managing national parks and production forests. CONAF has agreed to allow the SCCA to renovate a building for the <b>Andean</b> <b>Cat</b> Conservation and Monitoring Center on their already-functioning compound at San Pedro de Atacama in Chile.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>cat's</b> habitat spans four {{different}} South American countries. Each country has made individual laws {{to protect this}} wild cat. Each country also has its own protected game areas where hunting is prohibited. The table below outlines {{the number of the}} protected areas that fall within the <b>Andean</b> <b>cat's</b> habitat. Biologists are attempting to determine if any of these protected areas house significant populations of <b>Andean</b> <b>cats.</b>|$|R
50|$|Camelids, such as llamas, alpacas, vicuñas, {{are found}} in this ecoregion. Other mammals include the cougar, <b>Andean</b> {{mountain}} <b>cat,</b> <b>Andean</b> fox, and the Andean hairy armadillo.|$|R
40|$|Rarely {{observed}} in the wild, {{the existence of the}} <b>Andean</b> mountain <b>cat</b> (Oreailurus jacobita) has been established based on only 3 skulls and 14 museum skins. The <b>Andean</b> mountain <b>cat</b> 2 ̆ 7 s evolutionary relationship to other felids based on morphological characters is largely contradictory, with evidence aligning it with South American small spotted cats (ocelot lineage) or alternatively with pantherine lineage felids. Here we describe the phylogenetic distinctiveness and placement of the <b>Andean</b> mountain <b>cat</b> using DNA extracted from pieces of nine independent pelt specimens, including one confiscated from a trapper in 1995. A phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences from three rapidly evolving mitochondrial genes (16 S rRNA, NADH- 5, and ATP- 8) indicate that the <b>Andean</b> mountain <b>cat</b> is a distinct species belonging to the ocelot lineage. Our findings suggest that the <b>Andean</b> mountain <b>cat</b> diverged from a common ancestor with the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and margay (L. wiedii) and exhibits moderate levels of genetic variation...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>Cat</b> Alliance conducts {{training}} for park guards and local {{people to help}} them become local wildlife monitors so they may better contribute to protecting the <b>andean</b> <b>cat</b> and its habitat. Other activities include holding seminars and community festivals to both develop conservation strategies, and to raise awareness and learn {{the needs of the}} communities {{in each of the four}} range countries.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>Cat</b> Alliance (Alianza Gato Andino), AGA is {{a network}} of {{researchers}} and conservationists working to study and protect the <b>andean</b> <b>cat</b> (Leopardus jacobita) and its habitat in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru. The Alliance has managed {{to be the first}} to capture and radio-collar an andean cat; and they were also the first to obtain photographs by camera trap. The multinational team of researchers is partnered with the Wildlife Conservation Network The <b>andean</b> <b>cat</b> is regarded as one of the most endangered wild cats in the world and perhaps the rarest South American felid. Very little is known about this species and there have been only 10 documented sightings in the last 25 years.|$|E

40|$|The {{carnivore}} {{community of}} the altiplano ecosystem of the high Andes, including the <b>Andean</b> mountain <b>cat</b> (Leopardus jacobita) and pampas cat (Leopardus colocolo), {{is one of the}} least studied in the world. We determined the origin of 186 carnivore samples (184 faeces and two skulls) collected above 3000 m above sea level in northern Chile, including 33 from the <b>Andean</b> mountain <b>cat</b> and 75 from the pampas cat using diagnostic molecular genetic sequence variation. We determined for the first time food habits, habitat and physiographic associations, and general patterns of molecular genetic variation of the <b>Andean</b> mountain <b>cat</b> and the pampas cat in Chile. Both species had narrow dietary niches dominated by small rodents and there was a wide overlap in diet composition (0. 82), suggesting low levels of prey partitioning between species. The mountain viscacha (Lagidium viscacia) made up {{a large proportion of the}} biomass of the diet of both species, especially for the <b>Andean</b> mountain <b>cat</b> (93. 9 % vs. 74. 8 % for the pampas cat), underscoring the importance of further research and conservation focus on this vanishing prey species. Although the probability of finding <b>Andean</b> mountain <b>cat</b> scats increased with altitude and slope, there was substantial geographical overlap in distribution between species, revealing that the pampas cat distribution includes high-altitude grassland habitats. The <b>Andean</b> mountain <b>cat</b> had relatively low levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genetic variation (two mtDNA haplotypes) compared with the pampas cat (17 mtDNA haplotypes), suggestive of a distinct evolutionary history and relatively smaller historic populations. These insights will facilitate and provide tools and hypotheses for much-needed research and conservation efforts on these species and this ecosystem...|$|R
50|$|While the <b>Andean</b> {{mountain}} <b>cat's</b> main prey {{is likely}} the mountain viscacha, {{it is also}} probable that mountain chinchillas were previously important prey of the <b>Andean</b> mountain <b>cat</b> before their populations were drastically reduced due to hunting for the fur trade.Since it lives only in the high mountains, human-inhabited valleys act as barriers, fragmenting the population, meaning that even low levels of poaching could be devastating. They are often killed in Chile and Bolivia because of local superstition.|$|R

50|$|The Alliance is {{building}} an EcoMuseo (“Ecological Museum”) in the “Centro Poblado Menor de Alto Perú,” a Peruvian village located in proximity to <b>andean</b> <b>cat</b> habitat.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} goals of the Alliance {{is to work with}} governments to {{strengthen}} management of <b>Andean</b> <b>cat</b> habitat and promote new protected areas and corridors where needed.|$|E
50|$|Mammals {{reported}} in the protected reserve are 23 species, which include pumas, Andean foxes (Pseudalopex culpaeus) and vizcacha (rabbit -like), and also Endangered species of vicuñas (Vicugna vicugna), suri, Andean condor, keñua, puma (Felis concolor), <b>andean</b> <b>cat</b> (Felis jacobita), and quirquincho (Chaetophractus nationi).|$|E
5000|$|Some mammals {{native to}} the reserve are: the llama, the alpaca, the vicuña, the guanaco, the taruca, the vizcacha, the puma, the <b>Andean</b> {{mountain}} <b>cat,</b> the colocolo and the Andean fox.|$|R
50|$|Its flora is countless and beautiful, {{including}} important {{groups of}} Puya Raimondi. In its fauna, there are tarucas, spectacled bears, vicuñas, pumas, foxes, vizcachas, weasels, <b>Andean</b> mountain <b>cats,</b> opossums, hog-nosed skunks, etc.|$|R
50|$|<b>Andean</b> {{mountain}} <b>cats</b> occur localized. Their {{habitat in}} the Andes is fragmented by deep valleys, and their preferred prey, mountain viscachas (Lagidium) occur in patchy colonies.Across this range, {{the level of}} genetic diversity is very low.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>Cat</b> Alliance uses camera trapping, DNA {{analysis}} of feces, and surveys of local inhabitants {{to confirm the}} andean cats presence. AGA has widened the cats known range in Peru and Argentina and has helped to better understand its population density and genetic variability.|$|E
50|$|Six {{different}} species of carnivores live in the Andes Mountain range. Three of these species are cats, the <b>Andean</b> <b>cat,</b> the pampas cat, and the puma. The puma is a large predator, while the Andean and Pampas Cat are medium-sized predators. These two medium-sized predators are very much alike. They both hunt within the same territory. They hunt the same prey, the mountain viscacha (Lagidium viscacia). The viscacha makes up 93.9% of the biomass consumed in the Andean cat's diet while the Pampas Cat depends on it for 74.8% of its biomass consumption. Both of these cats depend on a specific prey {{to make up a}} large portion of their dietary needs. In some areas, the mountain viscacha will make up 53% of the Andean cat's prey items. This is because the other prey items are so significantly smaller that even though the <b>Andean</b> <b>cat</b> will successfully hunt, kill, and eat a mountain viscacha half the time, the mountain viscacha is so much larger than the other food items, it makes up more substance. They also hunt frequently during the same periods. During one study, both the <b>Andean</b> <b>cat</b> and the Pampas Cat were seen most frequently during moonless nights; the second most sightings of these cats were during full moons. These two cats both hunt the same prey, making it more difficult for them to find food, essentially creating a race to find the prey before the other does.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1998, {{the only}} {{evidence}} of this cat's existence was two photographs. It was then that Jim Sanderson took up his quest to find the Andean mountain cat. Sanderson sighted and photographed one in Chile in 1998 near Chile's northern border with Peru. In 2004, he joined a Bolivian research team and helped radio-collar an <b>Andean</b> <b>cat</b> in Bolivia. In April 2005, this cat was found dead, perhaps after being caught in a poacher's trap.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Andean</b> {{mountain}} <b>cat</b> (Leopardus jacobita) {{is a small}} {{wild cat}} native to the high Andes that has been classified as Endangered by IUCN because fewer than 2,500 individuals are thought {{to exist in the}} wild.|$|R
50|$|Among the mammals {{reported}} {{from the same}} area are: the colocolo, the <b>Andean</b> mountain <b>cat,</b> the spectacled bear, the taruca deer, the vicuña, the white-tailed deer, the puma, the northern viscacha, the long-tailed weasel, the hog-nosed skunk and the Andean fox.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Andean</b> {{mountain}} <b>cat</b> has a black {{nose and}} lips, and rounded ears. On {{the back and}} on the tail, the hair is 40-45 mm long. Its rounded footprints are 4 cm long and 3.5 cm wide. Its pads are covered with hair.|$|R
50|$|By {{using the}} residents' {{observations}} of Andean cats in coupled pairs with their litters, it is theorized that the mating {{season for the}} <b>Andean</b> <b>cat</b> is within the months of July and August. Because kittens have {{been seen in the}} months of April and October, this could mean that the mating season extends into November or even December. A litter will usually consist of one or two offspring born {{in the spring and summer}} months. This is common with many other species that also have their young when food resources are increasing.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{ecological}} factors that determine vegetation {{in the region}} are lack of water, saline soils, plentiful solar irradiation, herbivores, wind and cold nighttime temperatures. These plant species which release airborne pollen can often be identified in samples taken from Parinacota's icecap, where winds deposit the pollen grains.Animal species that live around Parinacota include flamingo, guanaco, huemul, rhea, vicuña and viscacha. Among predatory animals feature the <b>Andean</b> <b>cat,</b> the pampas cat and the puma. The most abundant animal species however are rodents, some of which can be found up to the highest treelines and which include the viscacha and the burrowing tuco-tuco. Also important are birds, such as the rhea, the tinamous, flamingos and various predatory and wetland birds, including the Andean condor.|$|E

Argentina had the highest representation of suitable climates, and Chile the lowest. The most favourable conditions were centrally located and spanned across international boundaries. Discontinuities in suitable climatic conditions coincided with three biogeographical barriers associated with climatic or topographic transitions. Main conclusionsSimple bioclimatic models can produce useful predictions of suitable climatic conditions for rare species, including major biogeographical constraints.

40|$|Goat {{husbandry}} is {{the main}} rural livelihood in the northern Patagonian steppe of Argentina, and herders kill any carnivore that they believe threatens their herds, including the endangered <b>Andean</b> <b>cat</b> (Leopardus jacobita). We evaluated the use of local, mediumsized, mixed-breed guarding dogs to reduce predation and retaliatory killing of carnivores. We interviewed 64 herders, and delivered 37 puppies to 25 herders. Most economic loss was attributed to cougars (Puma concolor) and culpeos (Lycalopex culpaeus). All herders with dogs that reached the working stage reported reduced rates of predation, and 88 % reported {{that they no longer}} kill carnivores. Among herders who were not using dogs, 89 % of them reported increased predation, and 100 % of them confirmed that they kill carnivores. Mixedbreed dogs can be effective in reducing both predation losses and retaliatory killing, but their success depends on the ability and willingness of herders to train and use them properly...|$|E
