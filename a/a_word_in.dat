These concepts have been found useful in automatic speech recognition systems for speaker adaptation.|$|E

25|$|Camden's Remaines {{is often}} the {{earliest}} or sole usage cited for <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> the Oxford English Dictionary; and further significant early usages (including new words and antedatings) have since been identified. Remaines also contains the first-ever alphabetical list of English proverbs, since heavily exploited by {{the editors of the}} principal modern dictionaries of proverbs (including those of Burton Stevenson (1949), M. P. Tilley (1950) and the third edition of the Oxford Dictionary of English Proverbs, edited by F. P. Wilson (1970)).

25|$|Acute accents {{may be used}} to emphasise <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> a phrase, on the vowel in the {{stressed}} syllable. If the vowel {{is written}} as a digraph, an acute accent is put on both parts of the digraph. Although that rule includes ij, the acute accent on the j is frequently omitted (resulting in íj instead of íj́), as putting an acute accent on a j is problematic in most word processing software. If the vowel is written as more than two letters, the accent is put on the first two vowel letters.|$|E
25|$|However, {{concerning}} the legend that cats could speak, {{it has been}} pointed out {{that it may have}} arisen because humans would misinterpret the cat's meowing as human language, and for this reason some would say that the cat is not a type of yōkai. In 1992 (Heisei 4), in the Yomiuri newspaper, there was an article that argued that when people thought they had heard a cat speak, upon listening a second time, they realized that it was simply the cat's meowing and that it was only coincidence that it resembled <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> human language.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Yes {{released}} their nineteenth studio album Magnification.

The record was not a chart success; it peaked at number 71 in the UK and number 186 in the US. Yes toured with a symphony orchestra in 2001 with keyboardist Tom Brislin, as Wakeman was occupied with his solo tours. Their performance in Amsterdam was released on DVD in 2002 and CD in 2009 as Symphonic Live.|$|E

25|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} several of the more eastern dialects is that they exhibit a great deal of vowel syncope, the deletion of vowels in certain positions within <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> <b>In</b> some dialects (primarily Odawa and Eastern Ojibwe), all unstressed vowels are lost (see above for a discussion of Ojibwe stress). In other dialects (such as some dialects of Central Ojibwe), short vowels in initial syllables are lost, but not in other unstressed syllables. For example, the word oshkinawe ('young man') of Algonquin and Southwestern Ojibwe (stress: oshkinawe) is shkinawe in some dialects of Central Ojibwe and shkinwe in Eastern Ojibwe and Odawa. Regular, pervasive syncope is a comparatively recent development, arising in the past eighty years or so.|$|E
25|$|Transliteration is {{the process}} in which a Sumerologist decides how to {{represent}} the cuneiform signs in Roman script. Depending on the context, a cuneiform sign can be read either as one of several possible logograms, each of which corresponds to <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> the Sumerian spoken language, as a phonetic syllable (V, VC, CV, or CVC), or as a determinative (a marker of semantic category, such as occupation or place). (See the article Transliterating cuneiform languages.) Some Sumerian logograms were written with multiple cuneiform signs. These logograms are called diri-spellings, after the logogram 'diri' which is written with the signs SI and A. The text transliteration of a tablet will show just the logogram, such as the word 'diri', not the separate component signs.|$|E
25|$|The private {{language}} {{argument is}} of central importance to {{debates about the}} nature of language. One compelling theory about language is that language maps words to ideas, concepts or representations in each person's mind. On this account, the concepts in my head are distinct from the concepts in your head. But I can match my concepts to <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> our common language, and then speak the word. You then match the word to a concept in your mind. So our concepts in effect form a private language which we translate into our common language and so share. This account is found for example in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, and more recently in Jerry Fodor's language of thought theory.|$|E

The Marulu Project focused on: FASD and ELT prevention, including creating awareness in communities that the project existed and educating pregnant women to prevent alcohol abuse; FASD diagnosis, including the development of diagnostic systems; FASD support, including {{the establishment of a}} map of support services available in the valley and a network of carers; conversation at a high level on FASD, including strategic communication through media channels, discussion with the scientific community, and increasing awareness through strategic partnerships; strengthening the project’s capacity to fight FASD through participating in workshops and attending conferences; identifying existing resources and securing new resources, including approaching the government and organisations for funding; and engaging resources in the local community in FASD prevention, diagnosis and support.|$|E
25|$|First {{proposed}} by Trier in the 1930s, semantic field theory proposes {{that a group}} of words with interrelated meanings can be categorized under a larger conceptual domain. This entire entity is thereby known as a semantic field. The words boil, bake, fry, and roast, for example, would fall under the larger semantic category of cooking. Semantic field theory asserts that lexical meaning cannot be fully understood by looking at <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> isolation, but by looking at a group of semantically related words. Semantic relations can refer to any relationship in meaning between lexemes, including synonymy (big and large), antonymy (big and small), hypernymy and hyponymy (rose and flower), converseness (buy and sell), and incompatibility. Semantic field theory does not have concrete guidelines that determine the extent of semantic relations between lexemes. The abstract validity of the theory is a subject of debate.|$|E
25|$|Both contestants {{write down}} the words they form, in case they select the same one. After time runs out, the host asks the contestants to declare their word lengths, {{starting}} with the contestant who chose the letters. The host then asks the discovered words, starting with the shorter declared length. However, if a contestant fails to write <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> time, they must declare this fact and state their word first to prevent cheating. The contestant with the longer word scores one point per letter, or 18 points if they have used all nine. If the words are identical or of the same length, both contestants score. In the former case, the contestants must show their written word {{to prove that they}} are the same. Each round ends with Dictionary Corner revealing the longest words that can be formed from the available letters, aided by the production team.|$|E
