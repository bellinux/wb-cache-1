Following the loss of all four carriers on 4 June, Yamamoto attempted to lure the American forces west to within range of the Japanese air groups <b>at</b> <b>Wake</b> Island, and into a night engagement with his surface forces, but the American forces withdrew and Mutsu saw no action. After rendezvousing with the remnants of the striking force on 6 June, about half of the survivors from the sunken aircraft carriers of the 1st Air Fleet were transferred to Mutsu.

During the Wake Island relief expedition later that month, Saratogas air group consisted of 13 Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters, 42 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, and 11 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers.

5|$|In the 1994–95 NCAA season, {{the sophomore}} was soon {{called one of}} the best {{eligible}} NBA prospects, along with his peers Joe Smith, Rasheed Wallace and Jerry Stackhouse. Los Angeles Lakers general manager Jerry West suggested that Duncan might become the top pick in the 1995 NBA draft if he went early, but Duncan assured everyone {{he had no intention of}} going pro until he graduated, even though the NBA was planning to add a rookie salary cap in 1996. He was giving up a lot of money, but was determined to stay in school. In that season, he led the Demon Deacons into the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship game against a Rasheed Wallace-led North Carolina Tar Heels. During that game, Duncan neutralized the threat of Wallace, while Childress sealed the win with a jump shot with four seconds left in overtime. In the NCAA Tournament, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16, and playing against Oklahoma State, Duncan scored 12 points to go with 22 rebounds and eight blocks, outplaying Bryant Reeves, but his team lost 71–66. Still, Duncan ended the year averaging 16.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game, was named Defensive Player of the Year and became the third-best shot-blocker in NCAA history with 3.98 blocks per game. He was also voted All-ACC First Team, a feat he would repeat in each of his two remaining years <b>at</b> <b>Wake</b> Forest.|$|E
50|$|Within the pons, the {{modeling}} and tracking of these aminergic inhibitory neurons and cholinergic excitatory neurons occurs via {{the study of}} PGO waves. These are phasic waves that occur in cycles, and originate from the pontine brainstem (P), lateral geniculate of thalamus (G), and occipital cortex (O). Aminergic monoamines serotonin, noradrenaline, histamine, and dopamine are balanced between acetylcholine cholinergic signals, and {{play a part in}} the regulation of cognition. Aminergic cell signal strength is lowest during REM sleep, increases during NREM, and is highest <b>at</b> <b>waking.</b> Cholinergic cell signal strength is highest during REM, declines during NREM, and is lowest <b>at</b> <b>waking.</b> Changes in sleep state and phase occur when two activity paths cross.|$|R

5|$|On 11 February 1943, Yamato was {{replaced}} by her sister ship Musashi as flagship of the Combined Fleet. The battleship spent only a single day away from Truk between her arrival in August 1942 and her departure on 8 May 1943. On that day, she set sail for Yokosuka and from there for Kure, arriving on 14 May. She spent nine days in dry dock for inspection and general repairs, and after sailing to Japan's western Inland Sea she was again dry-docked in late July for significant refitting and upgrades. On 16 August, Yamato began her return to Truk, where she joined a large task force formed in response to American raids on the Tarawa and Makin atolls. She sortied in late September with Nagato, three carriers, and smaller warships to intercept US Task Force 15, and again a month later with six battleships, three carriers, and eleven cruisers. Intelligence had reported that the United States Naval Base at Pearl Harbor was nearly empty of ships, which the Japanese interpreted to mean that an American naval force would strike <b>at</b> <b>Wake</b> Island. But there were no radar contacts for six days, and the fleet returned to Truk, arriving on 26 October.|$|E

40|$|Research has {{suggested}} that daytime cortisol secretion levels in children with autism may be higher compared to typically developing children. In addition, {{there is some evidence}} for higher cortisol secretion levels as a result of poor sleep hygiene in young children. Fifty-two subjects (26 children with autism (AUT) and 26 typically developing children (TYP)) from 2 to 5 ½ years of age were recruited from the Sacramento region. Cortisol was obtained from saliva <b>at</b> <b>waking,</b> midday, and bedtime on two consecutive days at three phases (baseline, 3 months later, 6 months later). Sleep measurement was acquired from actigraphy over 7 days and nights at each phase. G-computation estimation and linear mixed models were used for the primary analyses. <b>At</b> <b>waking,</b> AUT had a mean level of cortisol of 8. 29 (95 %CI 6. 99, 10. 51) nmol/liter and TYP of 6. 95 (95 %CI 5. 97, 8. 49) nmol/liter. The variability in the slope of cortisol for AUT (0. 0214, 95 %CI 0. 0066, 0. 0362) was 3 ½ times that of TYP (0. 0061, 95 %CI - 0. 0041, 0. 0164). The between-subject variance estimate for AUT (0. 0663, 95 %CI 0. 0148, 0. 1178) was 1 ½ times that of TYP (0. 0388, 95 %CI 0. 0021, 0. 0756). There was also a graded response among AUT by functional status - cortisol secretion levels increased as IQ decreased. There were also differences for some of the sleep parameters. The difference at the morning or waking sampling was 3 nmol/liter for 100 minutes awake compared to no waking during the night (95 % CI for difference: - 0. 23, 7. 69). The cortisol mean <b>at</b> the <b>waking</b> sampling was higher (13. 6 nmol/liter) for a child with a night-waking problem compared to a child without a night-waking problem (7. 4 nmol/liter) (95 % CI for difference: - 0. 55, 9. 35). The Sleep and Cortisol Study has contributed to the current literature by establishing average cortisol secretion values <b>at</b> <b>waking,</b> midday, and bedtime in preschool-aged AUT and TYP. Important differences were observed in cortisol variability in AUT compared to TYP and in cortisol secretion by functional status. Novel results for cortisol secretion <b>at</b> <b>waking</b> and the association with being awake and night-waking need replication in future studies...|$|R

While preaching in Boston, Dixon was asked to give the commencement address <b>at</b> <b>Wake</b> Forest University. Additionally, he was offered a possible honorary doctorate from the university. Dixon himself rejected the offer, but he sang high praises about a relative unknown who Dixon believed deserved the honor, his old friend Woodrow Wilson.
