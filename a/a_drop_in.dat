5|$|In the {{indirect}} or French process, metallic zinc is melted in a graphite crucible and vaporized at temperatures above 907°C (typically around 1000°C). Zinc vapor reacts with the {{oxygen in the}} air to give ZnO, accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> its temperature and bright luminescence. Zinc oxide particles are transported into a cooling duct and collected in a bag house. This indirect method was popularized by LeClaire (France) in 1844 and therefore is commonly known as the French process. Its product normally consists of agglomerated zinc oxide particles with an average size of 0.1 to a few micrometers. By weight, most of the world's zinc oxide is manufactured via French process.|$|E
