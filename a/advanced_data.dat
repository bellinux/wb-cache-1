25|$|Theoretical ecology is the {{scientific}} discipline {{devoted to the}} study of ecological systems using theoretical methods such as simple conceptual models, mathematical models, computational simulations, and <b>advanced</b> <b>data</b> analysis. Effective models improve understanding of the natural world by revealing how the dynamics of species populations are often based on fundamental biological conditions and processes. Further, the field aims to unify a diverse range of empirical observations by assuming that common, mechanistic processes generate observable phenomena across species and ecological environments. Based on biologically realistic assumptions, theoretical ecologists are able to uncover novel, non-intuitive insights about natural processes. Theoretical results are often verified by empirical and observational studies, revealing the power of theoretical methods in both predicting and understanding the noisy, diverse biological world.|$|E

40|$|This thesis postulates {{that the}} {{implementation}} of Mobile Ad Hoc Networking (MANET), Mesh and IEEE 802. 16 products can support a Distributed Operations (DO) platoon. Ground and Air assets will use MANET, Mesh and IEEE 802. 16 products to network a tactically deployed DO platoon through communications of ground and air based components. These ground and air components will link in an IPbased network and demonstrate the real-time exchange of data. This analysis {{will focus on the}} integration of traditional airborne assets with those of a DO platoon. By connecting those Sense, Decide, and Act (SDA) facets into a networked based architecture, the thesis experiments demonstrate that emerging commercial off the shelf (COTS) technologies can further <b>advance</b> <b>data</b> exchange between Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and enhance the ability to provide Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) to DO platoons in an environment where Air Force, Navy, and Army components are available for fire support.
