5|$|Some {{believers in}} a 2012 doomsday claimed that a planet called PlanetX, or Nibiru, would collide with or pass by the Earth. This idea, which {{appeared}} in various forms since 1995, initially predicted Doomsday in May 2003, but proponents abandoned that date after it passed without incident. The idea originated from claims of channeling alien beings and is widely ridiculed. Astronomers calculated that such an object so close to Earth would be visible to anyone looking up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> sky.|$|E

5|$|Cody Rhodes was a World Tag Team Champion {{throughout}} {{the beginning of}} 2008 alongside Hardcore Holly, who was acting as a mentor to him. Ted DiBiase made his first WWE appearance on the May 26 episode of Raw, in which he claimed that he and a mystery partner would take the World Tag Team Championship from Rhodes and Holly. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Night</b> of Champions pay-per-view event in June, DiBiase revealed his partner was running late and started the match without him, however Rhodes quickly betrayed Hardcore Holly by attacking him. This turned Rhodes into a villainous character and meant that he and DiBiase won the championship.|$|E
5|$|DiBiase {{made his}} WWE {{television}} debut as a villain on May 26, 2008, where he cut a promo about his intent {{to become a}} champion like his father, Ted DiBiase Sr., challenging the World Tag Team Champions, Cody Rhodes and Hardcore Holly. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Night</b> of Champions pay-per-view, DiBiase won the World Tag Team Championship in his first match in WWE, after Rhodes betrayed Holly, revealing himself to be DiBiase's partner. After holding the title for just over a month, they dropped them to John Cena and Batista on the August 4 episode of Raw. The following week, DiBiase and Rhodes used their rematch clause to regain the title.|$|E

On July 28 at the tapings of the August 6 episode of SmackDown Ziggler defeated Kofi Kingston to win the WWE Intercontinental Championship for the first time. In his first title defense at SummerSlam, he retained the championship against Kingston when the match ended in a no contest due to interference from The Nexus.

5|$|The {{creation}} of the championship was announced on June 6, 2008, by then SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero as a counterpart to the Raw brand's WWE Women's Championship. The inaugural champion was Michelle McCool, who defeated Natalya on July 20, 2008, at The Great American Bash. On April 13, 2009, the title was moved from SmackDown to Raw {{as a result of}} then Divas Champion Maryse being drafted to Raw in the 2009 WWE draft. On September 19, 2010, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Night</b> of Champions pay-per-view event, Michelle McCool (defending the Women's Championship on behalf of tag team partner and official champion, Layla) defeated Divas Champion Melina, retiring the Women's Championship and unifying it with the Divas Championship.|$|E
5|$|On July 18, at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, The Miz won a Money in the Bank ladder {{match to}} win a {{contract}} for a WWE Championship match that he could utilize at any time {{over the next year}} and became the first performer to win Money in the Bank while being a champion and the second, after Rob Van Dam, to hold a Money in the Bank contract and a title at the same time. Over the next few weeks, The Miz attempted to cash in his Money in the Bank contract on the WWE Champion Sheamus, but was continually interrupted by other wrestlers before the matches could occur, which meant that he retained the contract for future use. Daniel Bryan returned to WWE at SummerSlam, taking The Miz's place on Team WWE, causing The Miz to attack him. This began a rivalry between the two, with The Miz losing the United States Championship to Bryan <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Night</b> of Champions event in September. The following month, Miz defeated John Cena to become the captain of Team Raw, but at the Bragging Rights pay-per-view Team Raw—The Miz (with Alex Riley), R-Truth, John Morrison, Santino Marella, Sheamus, CM Punk, and Ezekiel Jackson—were unsuccessful in defeating Team SmackDown.|$|E
5|$|On the August 17 {{episode of}} Raw, The Miz {{announced}} {{his intention to}} challenge for the United States Championship, and also debuted new ring attire and defeated Evan Bourne. He challenged for the United States Championship <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Night</b> of Champions, Breaking Point and Hell in a Cell pay-per-views, but was unsuccessful. On the October 5 episode of Raw, the night after Hell in a Cell, The Miz received a rematch for the championship, and defeated Kofi Kingston to win the United States Championship and his first singles championship in WWE {{at the age of}} 28. The following pay-per-view event, Bragging Rights, was themed with interpromotional matches and now that The Miz was the second-tier champion on Raw he was booked against SmackDown's Intercontinental Champion, his erstwhile tag team partner John Morrison. In the buildup to their first match since splitting, the two hosted a one-off edition of The Dirt Sheet on the October 16 episode of SmackDown where the two compared themselves to '80s tag team The Rockers, debating over which is more comparable to the successful Shawn Michaels and which was the less successful Marty Jannetty. At Bragging Rights, Miz pinned Morrison to become {{the only member of the}} Raw roster to win an interpromotional match. The following month at Survivor Series, Miz captained a team of five wrestlers against Team Morrison in a five-on-five Survivor Series elimination match and once again bested his former partner surviving with Sheamus and Drew Mcintyre.|$|E

5|$|In August, {{she began}} a storyline where she acted {{friendly}} and nice, seemingly diminishing her heel characteristics, later shaking {{the hand of}} rival Kaitlyn following a match and teaming with her and Layla on the September 10 episode of Raw. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Night</b> of Champions pay-per-view, Kaitlyn was attacked and injured by a masked figure backstage, and as a result, she was replaced by Eve in a match against Divas Champion Layla, which Eve won. In doing so, {{she became the first}} ever three-time Divas Champion. After Kaitlyn revealed that her attacker was a blonde, Eve accused Phoenix, attacking her on the September 24 episode of Raw. The following week, pending an investigation into Kaitlyn's attack, Eve suspended Phoenix, which was reversed by Booker T. It was later revealed that Kaitlyn was attacked by Aksana on Eve's orders. At the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view, Eve retained the Divas Championship against Layla and Kaitlyn in a triple threat match. Eve then continued her feud with the duo, facing them in tag team matches with various partners, and defeating Kaitlyn at Survivor Series to retain the championship. At , she defeated Naomi to retain the title. After winning a non-title match against Eve, Kaitlyn went on to defeat Eve by disqualification on December 18, with Eve retaining the championship. A rematch occurred on the January 7, 2013, episode of Raw, in which Eve successfully defended the championship after losing the match via count-out. The following week, Eve dropped the Divas Championship to Kaitlyn. Following the loss, Eve immediately quit WWE in storyline.
