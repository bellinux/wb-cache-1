40|$|Summary. Rotational {{remanent}} magnetization, RRM, is the magnetization acquired when {{a sample}} is rotated during <b>alternating</b> <b>field</b> demagnetization. Although {{the existence of}} RRM {{has been well documented}} in different laboratories, until now no physical mechanism explaining its origin has been given. We propose that the RRM originates from thermal fluctuations biased by a precessional torque associated with the <b>alternating</b> <b>field.</b> Our theory is consistent with the observation that no directional preference exists in the experimental situation until the sample is rotated relative to the <b>alternating</b> <b>field.</b> Moreover, our theory predicts that the combined sample rotation and precession will produce a RRM that switches direction when the frequency of sample rotation increases from any value below the frequency of the <b>alternating</b> <b>field</b> to any value above that frequency as observed in experiments. Although no precise theory is given for the intensity of RRM, the model presented here can qualitatively explain previous intensity observations...|$|R

Archeological and volcanic materials may contain a range of magnetic grain sizes, which can be demagnetized with different <b>alternating</b> <b>fields.</b> In a similar approach to thermal demagnetization, an AF can be increased in steps and if the resulting magnetization at each increasing AF step decreases linearly to zero, a ChRM inclination and declination can be calculated.|$|R

40|$|Magnetoelastic {{resonant}} waves may {{be easily}} produced in ferromagnetic amorphous ribbons {{and they are}} useful for many applications as delay lines, micro-actuators and sensors. The source of this waves may be a magnetic <b>alternate</b> <b>field,</b> tuned to the acoustic resonance frequency Vo, or a mechanical oscillator, which produce an alternate strain at the Vo frequency. It is not frequent in literature to have the two source operating at the same time. This paper deals with the possibilities offered by the simultaneous presence of the magnetoelastic waves generated both by magnetic and by mechanical source in the same sample. It is experimentally shown the interference between the two kind waves. Moreover, the facility in using the two methods in the same sample and the theoretic proper model of the resonant waves enable us to have quantitative comparison between the amplitude of the magnetic excited waves and the amplitude of the mechanical produced waves.

We followed up the evolution of this early physical damage into chemical damage within human cells.

Using sensitive bio-methodologies we revealed that the early DNA damage was finally initiating apoptosis only when the damage was overwhelming intrinsic repair mechanisms.

40|$|Paleomagnetic {{study of}} Miocene basalts {{collected}} from a locality 7 km north of Desert Center, CA (33. 7 N, 244. 6 E) shows that rocks are rotated 46. 6 ? in a clockwise direction, results inconsistent with previous kinematic {{models of the}} development of the San Andreas Fault. While the history of the southern segment of the fault from the Holocene to present shows good agreement and consistency between the observed and predicted offset along the fault, the history from the Miocene to the Pleistocene is poorly known, which inhibits further understanding of the early development of the Northern section of the fault system. This paleomagnetic study, which was proposed to be used with existing paleomagnetic evidence to reexamine extend and magnitude of the vertical axis block rotation in the fault system, conclusively showed through AF demagnetization that the blocks had indeed been rotated. Samples collected in 6 lava flows show a general direction of north and down after demagnetization, while lava flows towards the top of the section possesses very strong, randomly directed magnetisms easily cleaned by low levels of <b>alternate</b> <b>field</b> demagnetization.

40|$|In 1998, the Power Electronics and Electric Machinery Research Center (PEEMRC) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) {{started a}} program to {{investigate}} <b>alternate</b> <b>field</b> weakening schemes for permanent magnet (PM) motors. The adjective ''alternate'' was used because at that time, outside research emphasis was on motors with interior-mounted PMs (IPMs). The PEEMRC {{emphasis was placed on}} motors with surface-mounted PMs (SPMs) because of the relative ease of manufacturing SPM motors compared with the IPM motors. Today the PEEMRC is continuing research on SPMs while examining the IPMs that have been developed by industry. Out of this task [...] the goal of which was to find ways to drive PM motors that inherently have low inductance at high speeds where their back-emf exceeds the supply voltage [...] ORNL developed and demonstrated the dual mode inverter control (DMIC) [1, 2] method of field weakening for SPM motors. The predecessor of DMIC is conventional phase advance (CPA), which was developed by UQM Technologies, Inc. [3]. Fig. 1 shows the three sets of anti-parallel thyristors in the dashed box that comprise the DMIC. If one removes the dashed box by shorting each set of anti-parallel thyristors, the configuration becomes a conventional full bridge inverter on the left driving a three phase motor on the right. CPA may be used to drive this configuration ORNL's initial analyses of CPA and DMIC were based on driving motors with trapezoidal back-emfs [4 - 6], obtained using double layer lapped stator windings with one slot per pole per phase. A PM motor with a sinusoidal back-emf obtained with two poles per slot per phase has been analyzed under DMIC operation as a University of Tennessee-Knoxville (UTK) doctoral dissertation [7]. In the process of this research, ORNL has completed an analysis that explains and quantifies the role of inductance in these methods of control. The Appendix includes information on the equations for the three components of phase inductance, L{sub gap}, L{sub slot}, and L{sub endturns}. PM motors inherently have a lower inductance because of the increase in effective air gap caused by the magnet, which is in the denominator of the equation for L{sub gap}. L{sub gap} accounts for about half of the phase inductance. Because of the low inductance, there is a propensity for currents to exceed the motor's rated value. DMIC solves this problem for low-inductance PM motors and, in addition, provides a number of safety features that protect against uncontrolled generator mode operation [8, 9]; however, the DMIC topology adds a pair of anti-parallel thyristors {{in each of the three}} phases, thereby introducing additional silicon costs as well as additional voltage drops during operation. It poses the tradeoff question; under what conditions can the beneficial features of DMIC offset its additional silicon cost and voltage drop losses? The purpose of this report is to address the tradeoff question. Sections of the report will: (1) review the role of self-inductance in performance and control of PM motors, (2) discuss the bounding inductances for motors with trapezoidal back-emfs under CPA control, (3) discuss the bounding inductances for trapezoidal back-emfs under DMIC, (4) discuss the bounding inductances for the PM synchronous motor (PMSM), (5) present the analysis showing how DMIC minimizes current in PMSMs, (6) present the results of a cost study conducted for two motors driven using a CPA inverter and for two motors driven using DMIC, (7) discuss estimating life cycle cost benefits, and (8) present conclusions...|$|E

In contrast, for a strong amplitude of the <b>alternating</b> <b>field</b> the current is dominated by several resonant peaks, in particular a marked peak appears at zero bias.

The phase-angle cosine for the first harmonic cos phi(1) becomes negative when the Bloch frequency increases to be larger than the frequency of the ac field omega, and it also shows resonance peaks at the resonance frequencies n omega.
