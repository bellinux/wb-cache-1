40|$|Design and {{construction}} of an <b>automatic</b> pellet <b>dispenser</b> <b>for</b> granivorous birds are described. The dispenser permits rapid pneumatic delivery of pellets (five pellets per second maximum) to one controlled position and does not interfere with simultaneous electrophysiological recording. In addition, the device continuously indicates {{presence or absence of}} a pellet in the delivery position. This <b>automatic</b> <b>dispenser</b> proved very effective in our studies of stereotyped topographies of feeding in granivorous birds, such as pigeons and chickens...|$|R

50|$|An <b>automatic</b> soap <b>dispenser</b> is {{specifically}} a hands-free dispenser of soap (both liquid soap and foaming soap), but generally {{can be used}} for other liquids such as hand sanitizers, shampoos, or hand lotions. <b>Automatic</b> <b>dispensers</b> are often battery-powered. The touch-free design dispenses the liquid when a sensor detects motion under the nozzle. The electronic components of an <b>automatic</b> soap <b>dispenser</b> allow <b>for</b> a timing device or signal (sound, lights, etc.) which can indicate to the user whether they have washed their hands for the correct amount of time or not.|$|R

To perform the solution, a CAD program has been used for assembling all components required and guarantee physical layout of them. Also, several studies have been made to know further features from materials concerned. The result is a first prototype which best combines storage capacity, price and ease of assembly. Therefore, the developed system is a significant alternative to traditional pharmacies for invest in technology and increase sales capacity...|$|R

40|$|Prototheca spp. are colorless {{unicellular}} algae {{ubiquitous in}} nature and opportunistic pathogens for humans and animals. Since Prototheca is an important cause of bovine mastitis, milk, as well as dairy products, can be contaminated and represent a potential mean of transmission of this microorganism to man. We carried out a survey on the <b>automatic</b> milk <b>dispensers</b> in the Emilia-Romagna Region (Northern Italy), to evaluate human exposure to Prototheca through raw milk. Milk samples were collected from 177 <b>automatic</b> <b>dispensers,</b> distributing milk from 117 dairy herds. Prototheca spp. was isolated on 17 milk samples (9, 6 %) produced by 14 dairy herds. The results of molecular characterization indicate that the isolates were P. zopfii genotipe 2 e P. blaschkeae, both species being associated whit human diseases. Our investigation points out the importance of raw milk as a carrier of microorganisms potentially harmful to humans...|$|R

50|$|Many modern washing {{machines}} have a dispenser that adds liquid fabric softener automatically {{on the final}} rinse. Users of launderette machines may need to add it manually. Some washing powder brands have fabric conditioning mixed in, which manufacturers claim saves money compared to buying separate washing powder and fabric softener. Some manufacturers claim their products make ironing easier or make clothes dry faster. All liquid fabric softeners are added to water—either by adding the product directly to the final rinse water or by 2:1 (water:softener) dilution in an <b>automatic</b> <b>dispenser.</b> Even diluted fabric softener can cause spotting when poured directly onto clothes, and can ruin them.|$|R
