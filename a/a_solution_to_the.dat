5|$|In 1735, Euler {{presented}} <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> problem {{known as}} the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected {{to each other and}} the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory, specifically of planar graph theory.|$|E

5|$|On October 17, 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries {{announced}} an oil embargo against the United States {{in retaliation for}} its support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War.

5|$|The Young–Dupré {{equation}} (Thomas Young 1805; Anthanase Dupré and Paul Dupré 1869) {{dictates that}} neither γSG nor γSL can {{be larger than}} the sum of the other two surface energies. The consequence of this restriction is the prediction of complete wetting when γSG > γSL + γLG and zero wetting when γSL > γSG + γLG. The lack of <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Young–Dupré equation is an indicator that there is no equilibrium configuration with a contact angle between 0 and 180° for those situations.|$|E
5|$|After the First World War, the {{population}} of the west London suburbs continued to grow, thanks to improved rail transport links and the growth in ownership of automobiles. In 1925, the Ministry of Transport convened a conference between Surrey and Middlesex county councils with the aim of reaching <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> congestion problem, and the Great Chertsey Road scheme was revived. In 1927, the Royal Commission on Cross-River Traffic approved the scheme to relieve the by then chronic traffic congestion on the existing, mostly narrow, streets in the area, and on the narrow bridges at Richmond Bridge, Kew and Hammersmith. The Ministry of Transport agreed to pay heavy subsidies towards the cost.|$|E
5|$|Al Dawasir {{attacked}} Shia {{villages of}} Barbar and A'ali, while the Khalids attacked Sitra island. The attacks {{resulted in the}} killing of 12 villagers, burning of several houses and raping of women. The violence settled after Colonel Knox, the British acting Political Resident arrived in Bahrain in two gunships. Knox forced Isa bin Ali to abdicate in favor of his elder son, Hamad. The Khalids had agreed to reduce taxes on residents of Sitra following the visit. However, as soon as Knox left, taxes were increased again, and Shia residents continued to be subjected to forced labor. The situation prompted some 500 Shia to hold a protest in front of the British Agency demanding <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> situation and equal taxation of citizens (taxes were only imposed on the Shia).|$|E

5|$|Ferdinando beseeched Louis XIV to do {{something}} about his daughter-in-law's behaviour; he sent the Comte de Saint Mêmê. Marguerite Louise wanted to return to France, and Mêmê sympathised with this, as did much of the French court, so he left without finding <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heir's domestic disharmony, incensing both Ferdinando and Louis XIV. She humiliated Cosimo at every chance she got: she insisted on employing French cooks, as she feared the Medici would poison her. In September 1664 Marguerite Louise abandoned her apartments in the Pitti, the grand ducal palace. Cosimo moved her into Villa Lapeggi. Here, she was watched by forty soldiers, and six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere. The next year she reconciled with the grand ducal family, and gave birth to Anna Maria Luisa, future Electress Palatine, in August 1667. The delicate rapprochement that existed between Marguerite Louise {{and the rest of the}} family collapsed after Anna Maria Luisa's birth, when Marguerite Louise caught smallpox and decided to blame Cosimo for all her problems.|$|E
5|$|For graphs G and H, the {{question}} of whether G has a homomorphism to H corresponds to a CSP instance with only one kind of constraint, as follows. The variables are the vertices of G and the domain for each variable is the vertex set of H. An evaluation is a function that assigns to each variable an element of the domain, so a function f from V(G) to V(H). Each edge or arc (u,v) of G then corresponds to the constraint ((u,v), E(H)). This is a constraint expressing that the evaluation should map the arc (u,v) to a pair (f(u),f(v)) that is in the relation E(H), that is, to an arc of H. <b>A</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> CSP is an evaluation that respects all constraints, so it is exactly a homomorphism from G to H.|$|E
5|$|German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticised Kant's {{belief that}} ethics should concern {{what ought to}} be done, insisting that the scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and {{interpret}} what actually happens. Whereas Kant presented an idealized version of {{what ought to be}} done in a perfect world, Schopenhauer argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that could work in the real world, capable of being presented as <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world's problems. Schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics, arguing that in both cases prescriptive rules are not {{the most important part of}} the discipline. Because he believed that virtue cannot be taught—a person is either virtuous or is not—he cast the proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people's behavior, rather than presenting unattainable universal laws.|$|E

5|$|In 1108, Ranulf {{was dragged}} {{into the middle of}} the ongoing dispute between Archbishop Anselm and the newly {{appointed}} Archbishop of York, Thomas over whether or not Thomas should profess obedience to Anselm. Because Anselm refused to consecrate Thomas without a profession, and Thomas refused to profess, Thomas was unable to consecrate bishops himself. Ranulf wrote to Anselm, asking that he might act as Thomas' surrogate and consecrate Thurgot as Bishop of St Andrew's. In September 1108, Anselm wrote to Ranulf forbidding anyone but Thomas or Anselm himself to consecrate Thurgot or any other bishops. Later, Ranulf tried to bribe King Henry to take Thomas' side. Thurgot had been prior of the cathedral chapter at Durham, but had disagreed with Ranulf, who arranged for him to be elected to St Andrew's as <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> quarrel.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, in {{an effort}} to defuse the racial {{tensions}} caused by the sit-ins, Mayor West announced the formation of a Biracial Committee to seek <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city's racial strife. The committee included the presidents of two of the city's black universities, but did not include any representatives from the student movement. The committee met several times over the next month and delivered its recommendations in a report on April 5. The committee recommended to partially integrate the city's lunch counters. Each store would have one section that was for whites only and another section for whites and blacks. This solution was rejected by the student leaders, who considered the recommendations to be morally unacceptable and based upon a policy of segregation. Less than a week after the Biracial Committee issued its report, the sit-ins resumed and the boycott of downtown businesses was intensified.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} {{scholars}} have postulated {{a number of}} theories about what Stowe {{was trying to say}} with the novel (aside from the obvious themes, such as condemning slavery). For example, as an ardent Christian and active abolitionist, Stowe placed many of her religious beliefs into the novel. Some scholars have stated that Stowe saw her novel as offering <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Was the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible? Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris? Stowe's solution was similar to Ralph Waldo Emerson's: God's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.|$|E
