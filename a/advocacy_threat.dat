40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis was {{to refer to}} {{fundamental}} principals of claims on accounting profession, to possibilities inducing potential conflicts of professional and employee interests and possibilities of abuse. At the same time I characterised independence threats. Among most frequent risks are self-interest threat and familiarity threat. We should consider also self-review threat, <b>advocacy</b> <b>threat</b> and intimidation threat. People working as accountants and those working as auditors should meet claims such as integrity, objectivity, confidentiality and professional behaviour. In my thesis I named concrete examples of accounting frauds as effects of violation of claims on accounting profession, conflicts of interests and independence threats. I also described examples of preventing financial frauds...|$|E
500|$|A 2007 {{article in}} Managerial Auditing Journal {{determined}} the top nine factors {{that contributed to}} ethical failures for accountants based on a survey of 66 members of the International Federation of Accountants. The factors include (in order of most significant): [...] "self-interest, failure to maintain objectivity and independence, inappropriate professional judgment, lack of ethical sensitivity, improper leadership and ill-culture, failure to withstand <b>advocacy</b> <b>threats,</b> lack of competence, lack of organizational and peer support, and lack of professional body support." [...] The main factor, self-interest, is the motivation by an accountant to act in his/her best interest or when facing a conflict of interest. For example, if an auditor has an issue with an account he/she is auditing, but is receiving financial incentives to ignore these issues, the auditor may act unethically.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{expulsion}} of an activist from the 2010 International AIDS conference and juxtaposes it with Bill Clinton's plenary talk from the same conference. These two events dramatize the complex and competing discourses circulating within the global AIDS movement. In particular, they illustrate {{the ways in which}} governments, NGOs, Big Pharma, medical researchers, and funders constitute a global bureaucratic matrix that promotes new 'truths' about the epidemic. Namely, that the battle will be fought and won through programmatic (economic, biomedical, technological, and pharmacological) interventions. These new 'truths' and affiliated practices render dissent and <b>advocacy</b> a <b>threat</b> to this programmatic rationality, and serve to silence the global AIDS movement's earlier calls for critical resistance and action. Drawing on Foucauldian "biopower" the paper offers a re-articulation of international HIV programs and institutions, and reads the techniques of HIV and AIDS governance, polemically, as a form of "biofascism. ...|$|R
40|$|Asthma is an {{important}} environmental justice concern for first generation Mexican-Americans. Families experience disparities in housing conditions, access to care, and legal marginalization. Little is known about how Hispanic/Latina mothers of children with asthma navigate these oppressions. Problem: The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe the discourses of environmental justice of a group Hispanic/Latina caregivers of children with asthma. Method: A photovoice design was used with Hispanic/Latina mothers (n= 11) in Tacoma, Washington, to take, discuss, select and display phototexts to policymakers that communicated their experiences and opinions in managing asthma for their child. Using critical narrative analysis, phototexts were analyzed for the use of agency and structure in confronting environmental threats to asthma. Results: Participants produced 33 phototexts taking on the roles of teacher, parent, advocate, investigator, and storyteller. Narratives identified environmental threats (breathable, meteorological, medical, social, emotional, and ingestible) and promoted protective actions and social <b>advocacy</b> against such <b>threats.</b> Conclusion: Mothers 2 ̆ 7 actions as teachers and advocates in the phototexts provided opportunities for promoting empowerment and solidarity with others in the face of multiple environmental oppressions. Critical narrative analysis of photo-texts provided an opportunity to identify important opportunities for furthering environmental justice in new immigrant groups...|$|R
40|$|With {{the wave}} of crises in the early 2000 notably Enron, auditor {{independence}} was put in the spotlight which has continually threatened {{the integrity of the}} entire auditing profession. Connected to these accounting scandals, it could be realized that most of the auditors involved in the audits of these corporations had long standing relationship with these clients. In other words, the auditors had extended audit tenures. This puts the issue of audit tenure into the open that is as to how long should auditors serve a client? The general {{purpose of this study is}} to examine whether extended audit tenures can lead to the emergence of threats to auditor independence which may impair the auditor independence. Our study is quantitative, using a self-administered web-survey to collect our data. The study provides results from a cross sectional design to examine the impact of extended audit tenures on auditor independence. This impact is compared across short and extended (long) tenures on the basis of the threats to auditor independence. Using paired samples t-test in SPSS for our sample of authorized or approved Swedish auditors; we find that extended audit tenures impact self-interest, self-review and intimidation threats that affects auditor independence. Our findings did not reveal any relationship between the <b>advocacy</b> and familiarity <b>threats</b> and the impact extended audit tenures have on them, hence we rejected the hypotheses relating to these threats. However, though the relationship was still not strong, the results for self-interest, self-review and intimidation threats proved significant and this prompted us to accept the respective hypotheses. In conclusion, our results show that there is an association of auditor independence to extended audit tenures...|$|R
40|$|Auditor {{independence}} is {{a cornerstone of}} the auditing profession and the basic principle that underpins {{the reputation of the}} auditing profession in the public eye. Indeed, it is the attribute most demanded from auditors by the public. Therefore, the sustainability of the auditing profession depends on how auditors can protect this principle. This dissertation consists of four interrelated essays concerned with auditor independence. Specifically, it examines situations that can threaten and impair auditor independence. In addition, this dissertation also examines several variables that may enhance and protect auditor independence. The first essay aims to examine the impact of social pressures occurring within audit firms on auditors’ judgment in the setting of a society with “high power distance” and “low individualism” cultural dimensions. The social pressures consisted of obedience pressure exerted by an auditor’s superior and conformity pressure exerted by an auditor’s colleague. Moreover, two moderating variables—a multi-dimensional professional commitment and locus of control—were included as moderator variables in the relationship between the social pressures faced by auditors and their judgment. The findings show that obedience and conformity pressures influence auditor judgment. Auditors who face the social pressures will make a judgment that may be even diametrically opposite to the independence principle. The findings also indicate that a multi-dimensional professional commitment and locus of control may potentially influence auditor judgment in a situation with social pressures. The second essay aims to investigate the association of <b>advocacy</b> and familiarity <b>threats</b> caused by auditor fee dependence and auditor tenure on auditor independence based on Finnish data, law, and auditing environment. This essay was motivated by the Green Paper on Audit Policy, published by the European Commission in 2010 that questions whether the maximum fee collected from a client should be regulated and whether consecutive assignments should be limited, among others. Contrary to popular belief, this essay does not find evidence that audit fees and long auditor tenure will jeopardise auditor independence. Therefore, the findings do not support policies to regulate auditor fees or limit auditor tenure in Finland. The third essay aims to examine the effect of client intimidation on auditor independence in an audit-client conflict situation. Intimidation threat is one of five independence threats that are explicitly referenced in the IFAC’s independence framework. Client intimidation was manifested in the client threatening to replace the auditor if the auditor did not adopt the client’s position. In addition, this essay examines the role of auditor’s perceived pressure and multi-dimensions of professional commitment as moderator variables. The findings suggest that auditors who experience client intimidation in an audit conflict situation {{are more likely to have}} their independence impaired than those who are in a similar situation but without client intimidation. Moreover, auditors who experience client intimidation perceive higher pressure than those who do not experience intimidation. Finally, auditors’ affective and continuance professional commitment dimensions moderate the relationship between auditors’ perceived pressures and auditor independence. The aim of the fourth essay is twofold. First, it aims to develop a scale for measuring auditors’ reputation awareness. Second, it aims to examine the correlation between the levels of auditor reputation awareness and auditor independence. A seven-item scale was developed as the reputation awareness scale. The findings indicate that the scale consists of one dimension. It also has a level of satisfactory reliability and a high level of validity. The findings show that there is a positive correlation between the level of auditors’ reputation awareness and auditor independence...|$|R
40|$|The lofty idea {{of equal}} {{justice for all}} is not the reason legal aid began in the United States. Legal aid was born from the indignation over injustices {{committed}} against the poor. Unable to afford an attorney, the poor could not effectively assert their rights within the criminal and civil justice system. Without access to justice through the courts, the extralegal activities required to defend oneself and exact justice such as personally forcing an employer to pay rightful wages, are deemed criminal in most cases. By providing legal resources to the poor, legal aid not only brought order to society by preventing lawlessness, but it protected {{the rights of the}} poor as citizens. The chronological history of legal services in America, from the first legal aid program, Der Deutsche Rechts Schutzverein in 1876, to the merger in 1964 of the 89 -year legal aid movement and the two-year old reform movement, which formed the federally-funded Legal Services Program (LSP) during the War on Poverty, shows the proliferation of legal aid societies in urban areas across the nation. Under the Great Society’s Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) and the LSP, legal aid greatly expanded with the use of discretionary government funding. During the mid- 1960 s and early 1970 s Legal Services programs showed great promise in eliminating the barriers that kept the poor entrenched in poverty. With the use of national “back-up centers”, the Reginald Heber Smith (Reggie) program and other initiatives, legal aid programs created a nation-wide network designed to help the poor with more than just their legal problems. Programs used class actions, legislative <b>advocacy,</b> and <b>threat</b> of attorney’s fees to reform laws and attack the very institutions afflicting the poor. As the history of legal aid in America becomes more apparent, the LSP looks more like an aberration, especially considering the previous eighty-nine years of legal aid as strictly a privately-funded affair. Designed to fight a war on poverty, LSP awarded grants to the majority of established legal aid societies, but because their boards and directors held fast to the traditional idea of legal services they were reluctant to use law reform to correct injustices. Reluctant board members, directors and those who ran the programs, in tandem with local bars, the unenthusiastic American Bar Association, and powerful business and political opponents ultimately eliminated law reform; as such, an opportunity to truly help the poor during the last {{decades of the twentieth century}} was lost. Access to Justice is less a “right” today than it was in the 1960 s. Since the advent of the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) in 1974, the quality of legal services to the poor has steadily diminished. The conservative view that legal aid is a form of unnecessary welfare and unnecessary interference by the federal government played a dominant role in the restrictions placed on LSC funds during the Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich eras. The 2 ̆ 2 Republican Revolution 2 ̆ 2 in 1996 resulted in the greatest restrictions on funding and ultimately ended the controversial 2 ̆ 2 Support Centers 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Reggie 2 ̆ 2 program. These restrictions reflect the historical concept of the “sturdy beggar” and the bygone philosophy that legal aid is a form of charity; as such, they work to identify and restrict the able-bodied poor from receiving any type of government aid, including legal services. LSC restrictions and initiatives promote the use of alternative delivery methods such as Pro Bono and Pro Se that move field programs away from quality legal services and suggest a return to the private charity days of the first legal aid movement. Without quality programs that allow legal services attorneys unrestricted use of the tools available to private attorneys, America’s promise of justice for all will continue to exclude the impoverished. The most heinous restriction, which places LSC restrictions on non-LSC funds today, creates an unnecessary and expensive overlap of legal services in Nevada, making it more difficult to coordinate the patchwork of legal services that comprise Nevada’s make-shift civil Gideon. The thesis includes interviews with those involved in legal aid in Nevada such as Supreme Court Justice Michael Douglas, Former NLS Executive Directors Carolyn Worrell and Wayne Pressel, Executive Director of NLS AnnaMarie Johnson, founder of Nevada Indian Legal Services Charles Zeh, Director of Nevada Indian Legal Services Dick Olson, and legal aid attorney and legislative advocate Jon Sasser. It utilizes the early work of Reginald Heber Smith, his book Justice and the Poor, and former OEO Director Earl Johnson Jr’s publications, Justice and Reform and To Establish Justice for All, to trace the growth and atrophy of legal representation for the poor. The thesis extends our knowledge by providing a more current overview of LSC with special emphasis on its Nevada Legal Services (NLS) program. The thesis also complements Annelise Orleck’s study of Ruby Duncan and the welfare rights movement by putting legal services in Nevada into great historical context. According to Justice Michael Douglas, there is still a group in the public which does not believe that legal aid is the work of a real attorney. This group argues that legal services lawyers must be second-tier attorneys, because a successful first-tier attorney would never choose legal aid as a career. Many of those interviewed such as Wayne Pressel, Jon Sasser and others are still fighting, in their own unique way, a war on poverty, an idea anathema to the American Bar Association, and the Legal Services Corporation today. Not only did these legal aid leaders challenge the institutions that perpetuate poverty, they refuted the idea that legal aid is a charity and through their work and talent disproved the second-tier attorney stigma that extends to the “people’s lawyer” and the legal aid profession...|$|R
