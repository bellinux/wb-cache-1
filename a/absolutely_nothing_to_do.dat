Pearce's Brigade of Arkansas State Troops and had fought at Wilson's Creek in 1861, mostly in Captain Larkin Bunch's {{company of the}} 4th Regiment, Arkansas State Troops. These men were mostly pro-Southern in attitude; but by far {{the majority of the}} men conscripted into the other companies in the regiment were either pro-Union or decidedly neutral and wanted <b>absolutely</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the war. They were conscripted to fight for a cause they did not believe in. This attitude is expressed very clearly in the autobiography of Pleasant Houston Spears.|$|E

I had no alternative but to sit down again, humiliated and furious.... Almost forty years later, I still haven't recovered from the shock." ...|$|E
500|$|Kaja: 1988–2008 {{became a}} bestseller in Norway. The book reached second {{place on the}} bestseller list of the Bestseller Association in Norway for general literature, in May 2009. Kaja: 1988–2008 sparked renewed {{controversy}} over perceptions of Scientology activities in Norway. In {{a review of the}} book, Dagbladet noted that because the author was writing both as a private individual and as a physician, [...] "he is trained to look at the familiar and intimate with professionalism and distance." [...] Upon the book's publication, representative Matthias Fosse of the Church of Scientology stated, [...] "Church of Scientology had <b>absolutely</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with this young woman's decision to take her own life. We are sorry for the loss the family has suffered, but this young woman was never a member of the Church of Scientology and never participated in any of the church activities." ...|$|E

Mirabai, Thyagaraja from the South, Haridas Swami, Baiju—all these great composers and musicians were wandering saints; they never came into society, nor performed in society." ...|$|R

It's ridiculous after 200 years that women are still second class citizens. No -- black men were allowed to vote fifty years before women could vote.

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{said the}} episode [...] "had plenty of standout bits" [...] {{but that it}} [...] "represented a major flaw" [...] and [...] "perhaps in the program as a whole", citing that [...] "here {{seems to be more}} of an emphasis on comedic 'bits' rather than comedic 'situations,' which doesn't bode well for a situation comedy." [...] He explained that [...] "The Baby Show" [...] in particular [...] "felt very disjointed, bouncing between jokes more than storylines. It even opened with a Jenna surprise-birthday segment that was funny for what it was, but had <b>absolutely</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{with the rest of the}} show." [...] Canning gave the episode a 7.0 out 10 rating. TV Guides Matt Mitovich liked that Josh had a story in this episode, and said that his impression of Tracy was [...] "pretty good". He remarked that [...] "The Baby Show" [...] was [...] "a solid episode, if a bit too theme-y for my broad-sitcom liking." ...|$|E
500|$|Rise Against {{finished}} recording their sixth studio album, Endgame, in January 2011, after recording some last-minute guest vocals. The {{lyrics of}} the album focus on real world events, such as Hurricane Katrina and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. According to McIlrath, although the lyrics discuss grim topics, they actually take on a positive view and were written from the perspective of: [...] "What if the place {{on the other side}} of this transition is a place we'd all rather be living in?" [...] On January 12, 2011, Rise Against announced the release date of Endgame as March 15, 2011. Although Spin Magazine labeled Endgame as a concept album, on January 7, 2011, McIlrath tweeted a clarifying message stating that [...] "the record is not a concept record and, fret not, has <b>absolutely</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the Dixie Chicks." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "Help Is on the Way", debuted on KROQ on January 17. A second song from the album, [...] "Architects", was debuted and released digitally on February 15. As a promotion effort, the band embarked on a short tour of South America in February and then a month-long tour of Europe in March. Upon returning to the United States, the band announced a U.S. spring tour with Bad Religion and Four Year Strong.|$|E

2500|$|Wallace's reaction, {{delivered}} in January 1859, {{was that he}} was gratified to have spurred Darwin into making the announcement and that it would have caused him [...] "much pain & regret" [...] if his papers had been published on their own, without Darwin's papers. [...] Darwin was still sensitive on the point, and assured Wallace that he [...] "had <b>absolutely</b> <b>nothing</b> whatever <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with leading Lyell and Hooker to what they thought was a fair course of action". He responded to Wallace's enquiry about what Lyell thought of the theory by saying that [...] "I think he is somewhat staggered, but does not give in and speaks with horror [...] what a job it would be for the next edition of [...] "The Principles" [...] if he were [...] "perverted". But he is most candid and honest, and I think he will end up by being [...] "perverted"." [...] Lyell was still struggling {{to come to terms with}} the idea of mankind, with immortal soul, originating from animals, but [...] "Considering his age, his former views and position in society, I think his conduct has been heroic on the subject." ...|$|R

5000|$|On December 27, 1999 Lopez and then-boyfriend, rapper and {{producer}} Sean Combs (who co-produced On the 6), were arrested with two others {{in connection with}} a shooting outside the Times Square Club in New York. They were charged with criminal possession of a weapon and stolen property. Lopez was soon exonerated; her attorney released a statement that [...] "Jennifer Lopez does not own a firearm nor does she condone the use of firearms", while Combs' publicist said that Lopez [...] "had <b>absolutely,</b> positively <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with this shooting". However, Combs was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury. The controversy was expected to dent On the 6s promotion, but a spokeswoman for Lopez said that was unlikely; the shooting had attracted attention primarily in New York. With the release of [...] "Feelin' So Good" [...] as a single, Lopez dove back into another sea of promotion with several TV interviews at the beginning of 2000. On February 23 Lopez wore a plunging, exotic Green Versace jungle dress to the 42nd Grammy Awards, which overshadowed the shooting and became one of the best-known red-carpet dresses in history. At the 13th Annual Kids' Choice Awards, which aired on April 15, 2000, Lopez performed [...] "Feelin' So Good". On May 2, she again performed [...] "Feelin' So Good" [...] and [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] on Saturday Night Live. That November a video album entitled Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good was released by SMV Enterprises, the home-media division of Sony Corporation's music-and-entertainment label Sony Music Entertainment. The album provides a documentary-style look at the launch of Lopez's music career with a mixture of interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, music videos and live performances.|$|R

[...] When it was displayed at an arms and security fair in Beirut in April 2009, a visiting explosives expert described it as [...] "one big fraud".

2500|$|The {{first test}} flight {{coincided with a}} visit by United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to China, and was {{initially}} interpreted by the Pentagon as a possible signal to the visiting U.S. delegation. Speaking to reporters in Beijing, secretary Gates said [...] "I asked President Hu about it directly, {{and he said that}} the test had <b>absolutely</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with my visit and there had been a pre-planned test." [...] Hu seemed surprised by Gates' inquiry, prompting speculations that the test might have been a signal sent unilaterally by the Chinese military. [...] Abraham M. Denmark of the Center for New American Security in Washington, along with Michael Swaine, an expert on the PLA and United States–China military relations, explained that senior officials are not involved in day-to-day management of aircraft development and were unaware of the test.|$|E
2500|$|After much speculation, on 30 September 2009, Alonso was {{confirmed}} to be replacing Kimi Räikkönen at the Ferrari team, partnering Felipe Massa, a move known as [...] "the worst-kept secret in F1". His contract covered three seasons (2010–2012), with speculated options {{until the end}} of 2014. Though his contract {{is said to have been}} signed as early as July 2008, Alonso confirmed only having a Summer-2009 agreement with Ferrari for a [...] start, which was later changed to 2010. Ferrari and Räikkönen, whom Alonso would replace, had agreed to end their contract one year early. Though it was reported that Alonso's contract was worth €25-million per season, Ferrari released a statement that cast doubts over the salary offered, stating that [...] "the numbers talked about have <b>absolutely</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with reality." [...] Ferrari also cast doubt on [...] "the arrival of technicians" [...] with Alonso.|$|E

2500|$|As a commentator, Miller {{became known}} for his {{straightforward}} and sometimes blunt remarks, which sometimes earned him the enmity of players.

[...] Miller said that [...] "guys {{with the name of}} Rocco don't get on the trophy, do they?" [...] Mediate, who has battled many physical problems throughout his career, nevertheless played superbly, and took the heavily favored Woods to an 18-hole playoff (and one extra sudden-death hole) before losing. Mediate later laughed off the remarks and Miller later apologized for his comments, saying: [...] "I chose my words poorly and in the future will be more careful."

In this statement, made {{in response to the}} U.S. letter of 17 August 1971 and its accompanying explanatory memorandum, the People's Republic of China declared that the U.S. proposal was a blatant exposure of the Nixon government's scheme of creating [...] "two Chinas" [...] in the United Nations. It added, there was only one China, the People's Republic of China. Taiwan, it added, was an inalienable part of Chinese territory and a province of China which had already been returned to the motherland after the Second World War. It went on to state that the U.S. was plotting to separate Taiwan from China and was wildly attempting to force members of the UN to submit to its will. The Chinese government declared that the Chinese people and government firmly opposed [...] "two Chinas", [...] "one China, one Taiwan" [...] or any similar arrangements, as well as the claim that [...] "the status of Taiwan remains to be determined".

2500|$|Here, once again, the cité neufve was {{claimed to}} be New York; au tour de had {{to refer to the}} Twin Towers (even though, in French, the word tour in the {{masculine}} – as it is here – has <b>absolutely</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with towers, but is part of a phrase meaning [...] "around"); the Deux grands rochiers had to be the Twin Towers themselves; and Arethusa was said to be an anagram of 'the USA'. Once again, however, a rather more sober investigation by Brind'Amour had already revealed (bearing in mind that, in French, faire la guerre aux rochers, or 'to make war on the rocks', simply means 'to struggle fruitlessly') that the reference was probably to Naples and its nearby volcano. Subsequent investigation by Lemesurier and his colleague Gary Somai suggested that it applied particularly to the Annales Cassinis report of its lava eruption of 1036, {{at a time when the}} Lombards of Capua and the Byzantine dukes of Naples were constantly at war over the city prior to the decisive intervention of the Normans. For 968, similarly, Leo Marsicanus had reported in the same annals that ‘Mount Vesuvius exploded into flames and sent out huge quantities of sticky, sulfurous matter that formed a river rushing down to the sea’. Thus, given that Arethusa was the classical nymph of springs and rivers, with a well-known 'spring of Arethusa' still visible today in the Sicilian port of Syracuse, the case for a '9/11' interpretation was evidently unfounded.|$|E
