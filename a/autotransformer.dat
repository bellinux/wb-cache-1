25|$|In Europe, {{and most}} 220-240V territories, the line voltage is {{sufficient}} to start lamps over 20W with a series inductor. In North America and Japan however, the line voltage (120V or 100V respectively) may {{not be sufficient to}} start lamps over 20W with a series inductor, so an <b>autotransformer</b> winding is included in the ballast to step up the voltage. The <b>autotransformer</b> is designed with enough leakage inductance (short-circuit inductance) so that the current is appropriately limited.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Joel S. Spira, {{who would}} found the Lutron Electronics Company in 1961, invented a dimmer {{based on a}} diode and a tapped <b>autotransformer,</b> saving energy and {{allowing}} the dimmer to be installed in a standard electrical wallbox.|$|E
25|$|ROs {{produced}} by the General Electric are used in AC voltage stabilizers. These stabilizers are based on an <b>autotransformer</b> that is controlled by two sets of thyristor stacks. The incandescent lamp of RO is protected by a ballast resistor and {{is connected to the}} AC output. The lamp averages the output voltage, suppressing spikes and sine distortions originating from the main. The photoresistor of the RO is included in one arm of the measuring bridge, generating the error signal for the feedback loop.|$|E
30|$|In MPRs, the phase-shifting {{transformer}} {{determines the}} power {{density of the}} rectifier. Among the auto-connected transformers, the transformer used in the 12 -pulse rectifier has the highest power density. The six-phase delta- and wye-connected <b>autotransformers</b> {{are the most popular}} in 12 -pulse rectifier. Therefore, it is meaningful to compare the delta- and wye-connected <b>autotransformers.</b> In this paper, we compare the two <b>autotransformers</b> from the input line current, load voltage, kVA rating under the same output power. Some simulations and experiments are carried out to validate the theoretical analysis.|$|R

25|$|The {{simplest}} ballast for {{alternating current}} (AC) use is an inductor placed in series, consisting of a winding on a laminated magnetic core. The inductance of this winding limits the flow of AC current. This type is still used, for example, in 120 volt operated desk lamps using relatively short lamps. Ballasts are rated for the size of lamp and power frequency. Where the AC voltage is insufficient to start long fluorescent lamps, the ballast is often a step-up <b>autotransformer</b> with substantial leakage inductance (so as to limit the current flow). Either form of inductive ballast may also include a capacitor for power factor correction.|$|E
25|$|Electromechanical {{regulators}} called voltage stabilizers or tap-changers, {{have also}} been used to regulate the voltage on AC power distribution lines. These regulators operate by using a servomechanism to select the appropriate tap on an <b>autotransformer</b> with multiple taps, or by moving the wiper on a continuously variable auto transfomer. If the output voltage {{is not in the}} acceptable range, the servomechanism switches the tap, changing the turns ratio of the transformer, to move the secondary voltage into the acceptable region. The controls provide a dead band wherein the controller will not act, preventing the controller from constantly adjusting the voltage ("hunting") as it varies by an acceptably small amount.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, 25Hz, a once-common {{industrial}} power frequency, {{is used on}} Amtrak's 25Hz {{traction power}} system at 12kV on the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C. and New York City and on the Keystone Corridor between Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and Philadelphia. SEPTA's 25Hz traction power system uses the same 12kV voltage on the catenary in Northeast Philadelphia. This allows for the trains to operate on both the Amtrak and SEPTA power systems. Apart from having an identical catenary voltage, the power distribution systems of Amtrak and SEPTA are very different. The Amtrak power distribution system has a 138kV transmission network that provides power to substations which then transform the voltage to 12kV to feed the catenary system. The SEPTA power distribution system uses a 2:1 ratio <b>autotransformer</b> system, with the catenary fed at 12kV and a return feeder wire fed at 24kV. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad used an 11kV system between New York City and New Haven, Connecticut, which was converted to 12.5kV 60Hz in 1987.|$|E

5000|$|The winding has {{at least}} three taps where {{electrical}} connections are made. Since part of the winding does [...] "double duty", <b>autotransformers</b> have the advantages of often being smaller, lighter, and cheaper than typical dual-winding transformers, but the disadvantage of not providing electrical isolation between primary and secondary circuits. Other advantages of <b>autotransformers</b> include lower leakage reactance, lower losses, lower excitation current, and increased VA rating for a given size and mass.|$|R

2500|$|Variable autotransformers (trade name [...] "Variac") {{were then}} introduced. While {{they were still}} nearly as large as {{rheostat}} dimmers, they were relatively efficient devices. Their voltage output, and so their dimming effect, was largely {{independent of the load}} applied so it was far easier to design the lighting that would be attached to each <b>autotransformer</b> channel. Remote control of the dimmers was still impractical, although some dimmers were equipped with motor drives that could slowly and steadily reduce or increase the brightness of the attached lamps. Autotransformers have fallen out of use for lighting [...] but are used for other applications.|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, in {{improved}} receiver circuits, {{in order to}} match the antenna impedance to the receiver's impedance, the antenna was connected across {{only a portion of}} the tuning coil's turns. This made the tuning coil act as an impedance matching transformer (in an <b>autotransformer</b> connection) in addition to providing the tuning function. The antenna's low resistance was increased (transformed) by a factor equal to the square of the turns ratio (the ratio of the number of turns the antenna was connected to, to the total number of turns of the coil), to match the resistance across the tuned circuit. In the [...] "two-slider" [...] circuit, popular during the wireless era, both the antenna and the detector circuit were attached to the coil with sliding contacts, allowing (interactive) adjustment of both the resonant frequency and the turns ratio. Alternatively a multiposition switch was used to select taps on the coil. These controls were adjusted until the station sounded loudest in the earphone.|$|E

50|$|Unlike transformer-type baluns, <b>autotransformer</b> baluns connect all {{the wires}} {{connected}} {{to them to}} a single ground voltage level.
