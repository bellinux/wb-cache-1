The Flames ended October with {{consecutive}} home losses, to the Colorado Avalanche and Washington Capitals, in which they surrendered two-goal leads in both. The team entered November {{in the midst of}} <b>a</b> <b>streak</b> where they lost six of seven games. During the slump, rookie forward Brett Sutter was arrested in Scottsdale, Arizona, on charges that he assaulted a cab driver. Sutter apologized for the incident and his teammates issued a release expressing support, but he was demoted to Abbotsford a few days later. He was subsequently traded to the Carolina Hurricanes along with Ian White in exchange for defenceman Anton Babchuk and forward Tom Kostopoulos in a deal that was being discussed by the two teams prior to Sutter's legal troubles.|$|E

5|$|Michigan's rushing {{touchdown}} {{in the fourth quarter}} snapped <b>a</b> <b>streak</b> of 24 quarters where Iowa hadn't allowed a rushing touchdown (dating back to the Orange Bowl vs. Georgia Tech). With his rushing performance, Denard Robinson surpassed 1,000 rushing yards for the season, becoming just the second Big Ten quarterback to accomplish the feat in conference history.

5|$|The mid-season, non-conference {{game was}} the first meeting between the two teams; both came into the game with highly rated offenses and poorly rated defenses.

Another win would qualify them for a bowl game. The Mean Green held a 1–7 record, and could not become bowl eligible by winning its remaining games, but the team's offense had improved {{over the course of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|The {{next year}} in 1962, the Red Sox {{had been in the}} middle of <b>a</b> <b>streak</b> of 8 losing seasons.
