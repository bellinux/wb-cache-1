5|$|The Brazilian Navy {{was sent}} out to patrol the South Atlantic with French, British and American naval units, even though none of its ships had anti-submarine {{capabilities}} and, not being <b>at</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> the Central Powers, its ships {{were not supposed to}} engage any threat outside territorial waters. Another Brazilian merchant ship, , was sunk by German submarine U-93 off Spain on 18 October, and eight days later Brazil declared war.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, {{having given}} clear warning of his plans, Darius sent ambassadors {{to all the}} cities of Greece, demanding their submission.

In 1918, she was withdrawn from front line service and was employed as a training submarine for new crews. She survived the war and sank while under tow by a British warship in 1919.|$|E

5|$|After Genghis Khan's {{death in}} 1227, his empire was divided by his {{descendants}} into four sections or Khanates, which degenerated into civil war. The northwestern Kipchak Khanate, {{known as the}} Golden Horde, expanded towards Europe, primarily via Hungary and Poland, while its leaders simultaneously opposed the rule of their cousins back at the Mongol capital. The southwestern section, known as the Ilkhanate, was {{under the leadership of}} Genghis Khan's grandson Hulagu. He continued to support his brother, the Great Khan, and was therefore <b>at</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> the Golden Horde, {{while at the same time}} continuing an advance towards Persia and the Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was <b>at</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Skanderbeg had been <b>at</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Venice. Realizing the {{magnitude}} of his challenge, Skanderbeg attempted to relieve the garrison by engaging in skirmishes with the Ottoman army. His forces succeeded in inflicting heavy casualties on the Turkish forces through guerrilla-style attacks. Efforts were made by Skanderbeg to use intelligence forces, operating as far as Constantinople, to gather information on Murad's plans of action. Meanwhile, near Scutari, {{he had been able}} to defeat a Venetian force and managed to considerably weaken the Venetian presence in Albania. Despite these efforts, on July 31 the garrison of Svetigrad surrendered due to a disruption in the water supply. The garrison was spared and a force of Ottoman Janissaries was stationed inside the fortress instead. Two years later, Murad would march against Krujë, only to suffer a heavy defeat.|$|E
