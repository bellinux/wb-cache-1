40|$|We {{consider}} a CDMA cellular wireless access network that handles various classes of calls that are characterised by different bit <b>rates</b> and <b>E</b> <b>b</b> =N 0 requirements. For the uplink {{of such a}} system we study the relationship between power control, admission control and user mobility. We compare two methods for power control: Constant Received Power Control (CRPC) in which the total power received at each base station (BS) is kept constant, and each Mobile Station (MS) is assigned a fraction of this received power, and Constant Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) Power Control (CSPC) in which each MS is dynamically power controlled such that the measured SIR at the Base Station is kept constant. In steady state, for stationary mobiles, CSPC should provide a larger admission region than CRPC. We calculate the admission regions for CRPC and CSPC under various mobility conditions, and find that with high mobility CRPC outperforms the CSPC based algorithm. I.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that a {{communication}} system using M-ary orthogonal signaling in additive white Gaussian noise can achieve capacity. However, in a worst case partial band jamming channel, orthogonal signaling fails to achieve capacity. In this paper, we show that a Mary orthogonal system using coding and side information provides reliable communications in partial band jamming. In particular, the system can achieve capacity by using the ratio threshold test (RTT) to convert all errors due to the channel into erasures. For the worst case jamming scenario, the minimum <b>E</b> <b>b</b> =N J needed for error-free communications is shown to be 4 ln 2 (4 : 43 dB). The optimum code <b>rate</b> that minimizes <b>E</b> <b>b</b> =N J is 1 = 2. With hard decision decoding, the minimum <b>E</b> <b>b</b> =N J needed for error-free communications is 8 ln 2 (7 : 44 dB) with the optimum code rate at 1 = 4. Hence, asymptotically, the typical 3 dB gain obtained by using soft decisions is observed. Moreover, this gain in performance does not require additio [...] ...|$|R

We {{show that the}} minimum <b>E</b> <b>b</b> =N 0 needed for error-free communication is e ln 2 (2. 75 dB) with RTT, and 4. 79 (6. 8 dB) with hard decisions. The optimum code rate that minimizes the required <b>E</b> <b>b</b> =N 0 is e 01 with RTT and 0. 46 with hard decision, and the optimum ratio threshold approaches 1 for large M. Next, we investigate the fundamental limit in direct-sequence spread-spectrum multiple-access (DS/SSMA) system employing an M-ary orthogonal code of length N = Mm, which is obtained by spreading every row of an M 2 M Hadamard matrix with a user-specific random sequence of length N.

40|$|To {{solve the}} problem that the low {{capacity}} in hot-spots and coverage holes of conventional cellular networks, the base stations (BSs) having lower transmit power are deployed to form heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets). However, because of these introduced disparate power BSs, the user distributions among them looked fairly unbalanced if an appropriate user association scheme hasn't been provided. For effectively tackling this problem, we jointly consider the load of each BS and user's achievable rate instead of only utilizing the latter when designing an association algorithm, and formulate it as a network-wide weighted utility maximization problem. Note that, the load mentioned above relates {{to the amount of}} required subbands decided by <b>actual</b> <b>rate</b> requirements, i. <b>e.,</b> QoS, but the number of associated users, thus it can reflect user's actual load level. As for the proposed problem, we give a maximum probability (max-probability) algorithm by relaxing variables as well as a low-complexity distributed algorithm with a near-optimal solution that provides a theoretical performance guarantee. Experimental results show that, compared with the association strategy advocated by Ye, our strategy has a speeder convergence rate, a lower call blocking probability and a higher load balancing level...|$|R

For block oriented data transmission we are interested to describe the TV channel for the duration of a data block with the smallest amount of parameters possible. Slepian showed that time-limited parts of band-limited sequences span a subspace with strongly reduced dimensionality. The discrete prolate spheroidal (DPS) sequences are the basis of this subspace. We exploit this property by using the Slepian basis expansion model (BEM) to describe a TV channel with a minimum amount of parameters. The mean squared error (MSE) of the Slepian BEM is 30 dB smaller than the MSE of the Fourier BEM for a frequency-flat TV channel.

We find that the frequency of these oscillations is proportional to the external magnetic field sweep <b>rate</b> <b>B</b> <b>e</b> and is inversely proportional to the square root of the heat capacity.

The magnetic-flux dynamics in a superconductor with a strong pinning potential for vortices is an important field of application for the self-organized criticality theory [1]-[5]. In the scope of its ideas the pinned vortices space distribution arises {{as a result of a}} subsequent local vortex avalanches establishing the critical state.

40|$|Corrosion rates {{obtained}} by very frequent (daily) measurements with permanently installed ultrasonic sensors {{have been shown}} to be highly inaccurate when changes in surface morphology lead to ultrasonic signal distortion. In this paper the accuracy of ultrasonically estimated corrosion rates (mean wall thickness loss) by means of standard signal processing methods (peak to peak - P 2 P, first arrival - FA, cross correlation - XC) was investigated and a novel thickness extraction algorithm (adaptive cross correlation - AXC) is presented. All of the algorithms were tested on simulated ultrasonic data that was {{obtained by}} modelling the surface geometry evolution coupled with a fast ultrasonic signal simulator based on the Distributed Point Source Method (DPSM). The performance of each algorithm could then be determined by comparing the actual known mean thickness losses of the simulated surfaces to the values that each algorithm returned. The results showed that AXC is the best of the investigated processing algorithms. For spatially random thickness loss 90 % of AXC estimated thickness trends were within ? 10 to + 25 % of the <b>actual</b> mean loss <b>rate</b> (<b>e.</b> g. 0. 75 ? 1. 1 mm/year would be measured for a 1 mm/year <b>actual</b> mean loss <b>rate).</b> The other algorithms (P 2 P, FA, XC) exhibited error distributions that were 5 - 10 times larger. All algorithms performed worse in scenarios where wall loss was not distributed randomly in space (spatially correlated thickness loss occured) and where the overall RMS of the surface was either growing or declining. However, on these surfaces AXC also outperformed the other algorithms and showed almost an order of magnitude improvement compared to them...|$|R

40|$|The {{probable}} {{maximum flood}} (PMF) {{is used for}} the xxi assessment of maximum flood potentials in spillway sizing of new dams and in evaluating the adequacy of existing hydrologic structures. Determination of the PMF begins with the estimation of the probable maximum precipitation (PMP) for a particular dam site. Selecting hydrologic methods and assumptions for converting PMP to PMF, which are most appropriate for Utah conditions, is important to meet current inflow design flood (IDF) safety standards. The objectives of this study were (a) to demonstrate a maximization approach to PMF determination, (b) to evaluate effects of basin characteristics and isohyetal or uniform rainfall pattern on PMP and hence PMF, (c) to evaluate uncertainties due to hydrologic procedures through sensitivity studies, (d) to analyze historical events for indications of <b>actual</b> loss <b>rates,</b> (<b>e)</b> to analyze historical snowpack and melt conditions for critical snowmelt conditions, (f) to assess implications of this study for a degree of conservatism index, and (g) to evaluate the implications of the study for the selection of procedures for PMF determinations. A sensitivity study was conducted to evaluate the hydrologic methods and assumptions (<b>e.</b> g., loss <b>rates,</b> unit hydrographs, basin subdivision, temporal storm distribution, flood routing, and antecedent events) which may be used in northern Utah PMF studies. The maximization of local storm PMF produced a higher peak reservoir stage than using basin average PMP only. Evaluation of effects of basin characteristics on PMF showed that local storm PMP is critical for basins up to about 2, 000 square miles in northern Utah. Estimation of maximum probable rain-on-snow flood conditions for Porcupine Basin for April, May, and June revealed that there are significant increases in peak flows and flood volumes due to the contribution of snowmelt in the months of May and June. The results from the degree of conservatism assessment performed on local storm PMF estimates for Porcupine Basin showed that the overall effect of assumptions made and procedures followed in a typical PMF determination is almost certainly a conservative estimate...|$|R
