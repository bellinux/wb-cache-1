5|$|A {{waterspout}} is {{an intense}} columnar vortex (usually appearing as a funnel-shaped cloud) that occurs over <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Some {{are connected to}} a cumulus congestus cloud, some to a cumuliform cloud and some to a cumulonimbus cloud. In the common form, it is a non-supercell tornado over water.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequencing}} {{can also}} be used more broadly to identify species present in <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> debris filtered from the air, or sample of dirt. This can establish the range of invasive species and endangered species, and track seasonal populations.|$|E
5|$|The Osprey is a medium-large {{fish-eating}} {{bird of prey}} or raptor. It {{is widely}} distributed because it tolerates {{a wide variety of}} habitats, nesting in any location that is near <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and provides an adequate food supply. It is the only member of its family.|$|E
5000|$|The {{quantities}} of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other biologically useful nutrients {{are the primary}} determinants <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water's</b> trophic state index (TSI). Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus tend to be limiting resources in standing water bodies, so increased concentrations tend to result in increased plant growth, followed by corollary increases in subsequent trophic levels. Consequently, <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water's</b> trophic index may sometimes {{be used to make}} a rough estimate of its biological condition. Although the term [...] "trophic index" [...] is commonly applied to lakes, any surface water body may be indexed.|$|R
50|$|A lagoon is <b>a</b> shallow <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{separated}} from <b>a</b> larger <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They {{have also been}} identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is <b>an</b> overlap between <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> classified as coastal lagoons and <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around {{many parts of the}} world.|$|R

5|$|The reliefs of Nyuserre's Sed festival offer a rare {{glimpse into}} the ritual acts carried out during this ceremony. In particular, the festival seems to have {{involved}} a procession in a barque over <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> a detail either not represented or lost in all subsequent representations of the festival until the reign of Amenhotep III (fl. c. 1390–1350 BCE), over 1000 years after Nyuserre's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Water brakes {{were first}} {{introduced}} on SheiKra at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in 2005. Water brakes {{can only be}} used when a splashdown element, in which <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> surrounds a section of track, is present within {{the layout of the}} roller coaster. When scoops on the last car of each train come in contact with the surrounding water, the train slows down and the water is sprayed several feet into the air behind it.|$|E
5|$|Another {{music video}} for the Maanstudio remix {{version of the}} song was shot by Ciprian Strugariu and {{uploaded}} onto MediaPro Music's YouTube channel on 9 December 2011. Andra Moga and Violeta Irimia were credited for styling and make-up, respectively. The visual starts with angle shots of the singer lying on sand, followed by her walking on a field wearing a black dress. Subsequently, the singer poses {{in front of a}} stonewall and performs to the song sporting a transparent jacket and a black leotard.

5|$|For {{creating}} the steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity, and for cooling the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling water that {{is used in the}} Lynemouth power station is taken from <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> located close to the plant, the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to cool the heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The cooling water is then transferred back to the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, a Flat-Earth proponent named John Hampden {{offered a}} £500 wager (equivalent to about £ in present-day terms) in a {{magazine}} advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> such as a river, canal, or lake. Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10km) stretch of canal. Both objects were {{at the same height}} above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.|$|E
5|$|Landing on the island, Johnny and Zatch {{lead the}} attack on the royal city, taking down Chi's henchmen and freeing Mac. Johnny confronts Colonel Chi, {{successfully}} defeating him by knocking him into <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> with the help of Adam and his Game Gear. With Chi's rule undone, peace is restored to Patusan. Johnny is seated as the heralded warrior prince with Ro-May as his princess and Adam as a prince. Johnny declares the monarchy to be dissolved and announces that Patusan will operate as a democracy. His reason for doing this is for the people to finally be free of rule, good or evil.|$|E

5|$|Pokémon Red and Blue {{take place}} in the region of Kanto. This is one {{distinct}} region shown in later games, with different geographical habitats for the 151 existing Pokémon species, along with human-populated towns and cities, and Routes connecting locations with one another. Some areas are only accessible once the player learns a special ability or gains a special item. Areas in which the player can catch Pokémon range from caves to the sea, where the kinds of Pokémon available to catch varies. For example, Tentacool can only be caught either through fishing or when the player is in <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> while Zubat can only be caught in a cave.|$|E
5|$|St Andrew's Castle {{was built}} to defend Southampton Water, <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> which linked the Solent to the {{important}} port of Southampton. It was positioned by the shore, on what is now Hamble Common, {{to the south of}} the village of Hamble-le-Rice. It was located at one end of an old Iron Age ditch—the area had previously been occupied during this period, when a promontory hillfort, Hamble Common Camp, was built just along the coast. Construction took place between 1542 and 1543, but the fortification may not have been fully completed until after Henry's death in 1547.|$|E
5|$|The central item of Oracle of Seasons is the Rod of Seasons. By {{standing}} on a stump and swinging the rod, Link can change the season and affect his surroundings. For example, to cross <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> Link can change the season to winter and walk on the ice. Changing the season to summer causes vines to flourish, which Link can use to scale cliffs. When Link obtains the rod, he initially cannot use it. In {{the course of the}} game, Link visits four towers that house the four spirits of the seasons; each tower Link visits allows him to switch to an additional season.|$|E

5|$|Tornadoes {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} colors, {{depending}} on the environment in which they form. Those that form in dry environments can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris {{at the base of the}} funnel. Condensation funnels that pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> (as a waterspout), tornadoes can turn white or even blue. Slow-moving funnels, which ingest a considerable amount of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the Great Plains can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning white.|$|E
5|$|As {{the week}} goes on, {{the people in}} the cabin are running out of food, while Satoru is {{subjected}} to multiple attempts on his life by an unknown assailant. As days pass, Satoru notices that he can see the same lunar phase at SPHIA and at the cabin and that both areas are surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> It is revealed that the Yuni in the cabin is from the year 2012, while the Yuni at SPHIA is from 2011. Satoru finds a locked room in the basement of SPHIA, where he encounters a man named Enomoto, monitoring the facility through cameras. Enomoto tells Satoru that it is not consciousnesses that are transferred but the entire area within a 110-metre radius that is transported across time and space, with their consciousnesses left behind. Satoru attempts to destroy the facility, and Enomoto tries to stop him. A set of transfers occur, and Enomoto is killed by someone using Satoru's body.|$|E
5|$|Calshot Castle was {{designed}} to protect the Solent, <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> that led from the English Channel to the naval base at Portsmouth and, through Southampton Water, to the important port of Southampton. The castle was one of four forts that William Fitzwilliam, the Lord Admiral, and William Paulet decided to build to improve the defences along the Solent; the others were at East and West Cowes, and Hurst. Calshot was constructed on the narrow Calshot Spit, overlooking the deep-water channel running through into Southampton. Temporary earthwork defences and gun batteries were erected as an interim measure, but the castle itself was built quickly and finished by the end of 1540. It probably reused stone and lead from Bealieu and Netley abbeys, which had recently been closed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.|$|E
