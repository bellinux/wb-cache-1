5|$|The 19th-century {{historian}} Theodor Mommsen compiled {{and described}} in detail the various elements {{that at one time}} or another have been asserted as elements within the ritualistic execution of a parricide during the Roman Era. The following paragraph is based on that description, it is not to be regarded as a static ritual that <b>always</b> <b>was</b> observed, but as a descriptive enumeration of elements gleaned from several sources written over a period of several centuries. Mommsen, for example, notes that the monkey hardly can have been an ancient element in the execution ritual.|$|E

25|$|Actually, Pobedonostsev's {{ascension}} in {{the first}} days after the assassination of Alexander II resulted in the subsequent resignation of Loris-Melikov and other ministers eager for liberal reforms. He <b>always</b> <b>was</b> an uncompromising conservative and never shrank from boldly expressing his staunch opinions. Consequently, in liberal circles he was always denounced as an obscurantist, pedant, and an enemy of progress.|$|E
25|$|Russell left a large {{assortment}} of writing. From his adolescent years, {{he wrote about}} 3,000 words a day, with relatively few corrections; his first draft nearly <b>always</b> <b>was</b> his last, even on the most complex, technical matters. His previously unpublished work is an immense treasure trove, and scholars continue to gain new insights into Russell's thought.|$|E

Under Barks, Scrooge <b>always</b> <b>was</b> a malleable character who would take on whatever persona was convenient to the plot.|$|E

He affected a posture of self-confidence and eccentricity. He often was arrogant and selfish toward friends and patrons. A constant self-promoter and egoist, he relished shocking friends and enemies. Though he could be droll and flippant about social and political matters, he <b>always</b> <b>was</b> serious about art and often invited public controversy and debate to argue for his strongly held theories.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the 21st Century, Oulton Park is still as popular as ever and still as {{demanding}} as it ever has been on drivers and riders, but, in common with so many circuits, it no longer hosts major international events. Gone are the glory days when all the major Formula One teams (including Scuderia Ferrari) came to Cheshire, now the major events on the circuit’s calendar are the twice-yearly visit of the British Superbike Championship and the annual visit of the British Touring Car Championship. This is no fault of the circuit management – it is just the way the sport has gone. But Oulton Park is still the great challenge it <b>always</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1984, {{there is}} a {{perpetual}} war between Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, the superstates {{that emerged from the}} global atomic war. The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism, by Emmanuel Goldstein, explains that each state is so strong it cannot be defeated, even with the combined forces of two superstates, despite changing alliances. To hide such contradictions, history is rewritten to explain that the (new) alliance <b>always</b> <b>was</b> so; the populaces are accustomed to doublethink and accept it. The war is not fought in Oceanian, Eurasian or Eastasian territory but in the Arctic wastes and in a disputed zone comprising the sea and land from Tangiers (Northern Africa) to Darwin (Australia). At the start, Oceania and Eastasia are allies fighting Eurasia in northern Africa and the Malabar Coast.|$|E

25|$|At {{the top of}} the Communist Party was the Central Committee, elected at Party Congresses and Conferences. The Central Committee in turn {{voted for}} a Politburo (called the Presidium between 1952–1966), Secretariat and the General Secretary (First Secretary from 1953 to 1966), the de facto highest office in the USSR. Depending on the degree of power consolidation, it was either the Politburo as a {{collective}} body or the General Secretary, who <b>always</b> <b>was</b> one of the Politburo members, that effectively led the party and the country (except for the period of the highly personalized authority of Stalin, exercised directly through his position in the Council of Ministers rather than the Politburo after 1941). They were not controlled by the general party membership, as the key principle of the party organization was democratic centralism, demanding strict subordination to higher bodies, and elections went uncontested, endorsing the candidates proposed from above.|$|E
25|$|Head faced his {{debilitating}} illness with a {{great degree}} of heroism. As Dr.George Riddoch wrote:When his final work on aphasia was finished we discussed the situation together. With his practical philosophy he accepted it at once, and his amazing power of adaptation enabled him to plan the rearrangement of his life. With his excellent general health he well knew {{what he had to}} face — long years of steadily increasing physical disablement, with his mind unimpaired except in its capacity for continuous effort; {{in the grip of a}} relentless foe which medical science could not restrain. Without a word of self-pity, with distress only for his devoted wife's heavy burden, he set himself in his methodical way to make his plans, and nothing was omitted. It was as if he was dealing with one of his own patients. His attitude of mind, as <b>always,</b> <b>was</b> constructive and never defeatist. Essentially an individualist, whilst dependent upon friends and kindred spirits, he succeeded in keeping alive his wide interests and, through the attraction of his personality, the contacts which were necessary to him. Science, literature, music, human affairs, all retained their accustomed importance, although in a increasingly restricted sense as the enemy, whom he could not conquer, but who never defeated his active mind, encircled him ever more tightly. Each outpost lost led to new adjustments, every cold or minor ailment added to the rate of downward progress without hope of improvement. But his courage, tenacity and constructiveness remained unimpaired.|$|E
