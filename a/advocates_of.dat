5|$|<b>Advocates</b> <b>of</b> {{changing}} the team's name say that stereotypes of Native Americans {{must be understood}} {{in the context of}} a history that includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts by federal and state governments to eradicate native cultures, such as the boarding schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{reputation}} underwent a renaissance during the Reagan administration, modern assessments of Coolidge's presidency are divided. He is adulated among <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> smaller government and laissez-faire; supporters {{of an active}} central government generally view him less favorably, while both sides praise his stalwart support of racial equality.|$|E
5|$|Creationist sources {{frequently}} define evolution {{according to}} a colloquial, rather than scientific, meaning. As a result, many attempts to rebut evolution do not address the findings of evolutionary biology (see straw man argument). This also means that <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> creationism and evolutionary biologists often simply speak past each other.|$|E

5|$|Struthers {{was one of}} {{the first}} <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> the theory of evolution, {{speaking}} publicly and corresponding with Charles Darwin about observations he made during his comparative anatomy studies.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} {{paleontology}} have {{also contributed to}} the development of evolutionary theory. In 1944 George Gaylord Simpson published Tempo and Mode in Evolution, which used quantitative analysis to show that the fossil record was consistent with the branching, non-directional, patterns predicted by the <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> evolution driven by natural selection and genetic drift rather than the linear trends predicted by earlier <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis. This integrated paleontology into the modern evolutionary synthesis. In 1972 Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould used fossil evidence to advocate the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which maintains that evolution is characterized by long periods of relative stasis and much shorter periods of relatively rapid change.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the texts}} of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to {{non-human}} life, but without a universal consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.|$|E
5|$|Although Suzuki might {{indeed have}} seen peace as a distant goal, {{he had no}} design to achieve it within any {{immediate}} time span or on terms acceptable to the Allies. His own comments at the conference of senior statesmen gave no hint that he favored any early cessation of the war...Suzuki's selections for the most critical cabinet posts were, with one exception, not <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> peace either.|$|E
5|$|Despite growing {{pressure}} for his deposition, Stigand continued {{to attend the}} royal court and to consecrate bishops, until in 1070 he was deposed by papal legates and imprisoned at Winchester. His intransigence towards the papacy was used as propaganda by Norman <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> {{the view that the}} English church was backward and needed reform.|$|E
5000|$|Abbott's {{opinions}} {{differed from}} those of Beecher. Abbott was a constant <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> social reform, and was an <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> Theodore Roosevelt's progressivism for almost 20 years. He would later adopt a pronouncedly liberal theology. He was also a pronounced Christian Evolutionist. In two of his books, The Evolution of Christianity and The Theology of an Evolutionist, Abbott applied the concept of evolution in a Christian theological perspective. Although he himself objected to being called an <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> Darwinism, he was an optimistic <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> evolution who thought that [...] "what Jesus saw, humanity is becoming." ...|$|R
50|$|Sibley's upset {{victory in}} November 1892 won him {{a place in}} the Fifty-third Congress. In Washington the {{freshman}} Congressman emerged as a leading critic of the gold standard and <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> unlimited coinage of silver. Sibley was also an <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> depoliticizing the tariff question and an early <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> a constitutional change which would have limited the President of the United States to a single 6-year term of office.|$|R
50|$|He was an <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> {{sustainable}} {{family farming}} and {{coined the concept}} of the technology treadmill. He was opposed to government commodity program payments and an early <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> set aside programs to benefit conservation.|$|R
5|$|He {{supported}} {{public education}} in the colonies, {{and was a member}} of both the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and the Royal Society. He also influenced American architecture, being responsible for the planned layout and design of colonial/provincial capitals of Annapolis, Maryland and Williamsburg, Virginia. He was one of the earliest <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> colonial union, principally for reasons of defense against common enemies.|$|E
5|$|Like Lovinescu, other <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> modernist {{literature}} rejected most of Cerna's contributions. One of {{the first}} to have done so is Ovid Densusianu, who stated his belief that an artist's work should be separated from his life. Lovinescu, who commented on Densusianu and his thoughts on Cerna, opined that Densusianu had a tendency to reject all poets who registered popular success, and that he treated Dimitrie Anghel's work in much the same way.|$|E

The 1971 festival was filmed by Nicolas Roeg and David Puttnam and was released as a film called simply Glastonbury Fayre.|$|E
50|$|A {{prominent}} left-wing activist, Kassir was {{a strong}} <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> freedom for the Palestinians, democracy in Lebanon and Syria and a vocal critic of the Syrian presence in Lebanon. He was a keen <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> secular democracy in the Middle East.|$|R

5|$|Teilhard de Chardin's {{ideas have}} been seen by <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> the Gaia {{hypothesis}} proposed by James Lovelock, which holds that the living and nonliving parts of Earth {{can be viewed as}} a complex interacting system with similarities to a single organism, as being connected to Lovelock's ideas. The Gaia hypothesis has also been viewed by Lynn Margulis and others as an extension of endosymbiosis and exosymbiosis. This modified hypothesis postulates that all living things have a regulatory effect on the Earth's environment that promotes life overall.|$|E
5|$|Baxter was {{recruited}} by the then-New South Wales University of Technology {{as a professor of}} chemical engineering in 1949. He {{became one of the most}} prolific public <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> nuclear power for Australia. He served as chairman of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission from 1957 to 1972 and the International Atomic Energy Agency from 1969 to 1970. He oversaw the construction of the High Flux Australian Reactor (HIFAR) at Lucas Heights. He also founded the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), and, as the chairman of the Sydney Opera House Trust, brought the Sydney Opera House to completion and opening on 20 October 1973.|$|E
5|$|Desha {{gradually}} became more conservative {{after his return}} to the House, consistently resisting expansion of the U.S. Navy. He also opposed Secretary of War James Monroe's request to maintain a standing peacetime army of 20,000 men. Desha argued that a large standing army provided the <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> a larger federal government with an excuse to increase taxes, and proposed that the standing army should consist of only 6,000 men. A coalition of Federalists and conservative Democratic-Republicans in the House united to adopt Desha's suggestion by a vote of 7565. The version of the bill passed by the Senate, however, required a standing army of 15,000 men. The legislation was referred to a conference committee, which ultimately adopted a compromise of 10,000 men.|$|E

5|$|During 1913-19, <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> woman {{suffrage}} drew on {{the educational}} and advertising techniques of the national parties and the lobbying tactics of the women's club movement. They also tapped into popular culture, successfully using popular symbolism and traditional ideals to adapt community festivals and social gatherings {{to the task of}} political persuasion. The Dallas Equal Suffrage Association developed a suffrage campaign based on social values and community standards. Community and social occasions served as recruiting opportunities for the suffrage cause, blunting its radical implications with the familiarity of customary events and dressing it in the values of traditional female behavior, especially propriety.|$|E
5|$|Implementation of the Bland–Allison Act {{did not end}} {{calls for}} free silver. The 1880s saw a steep decline in the prices of grain and other {{agricultural}} commodities. Silver advocates argued that this dropoff, which caused the price of grain to fall below its cost of production, {{was caused by the}} failure of the government to adequately increase the money supply, which had remained steady on a per capita basis. <b>Advocates</b> <b>of</b> the gold standard attributed the decline to advances in production and transportation. The late 19th century saw divergent views in economics as the laissez-faire orthodoxy was questioned by younger economists, and both sides found ample support for their views from theorists.|$|E
5|$|In 1830 {{a series}} of {{revolutions}} struck Europe: the July Revolution in France, the Belgian Revolution and smaller revolts in Italy threatened to overthrow the framework of European politics established at the Congress of Vienna. As the Russian tsars were among the strongest <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> that status quo, the uprising in Poland and the ousting of the tsar as the king of Poland by the Sejm and Senate of Poland on 25 January 1831 were considered a serious irritant. Russia could not send its armies to Belgium or France before the rebellion in Poland was quelled. For that reason the capture of Warsaw was Russia's main target in the war {{from the start of}} hostilities.|$|E
