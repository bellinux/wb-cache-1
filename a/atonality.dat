5|$|Wagner's later musical style {{introduced}} {{new ideas}} in harmony, melodic process (leitmotif) and operatic structure. Notably from Tristan und Isolde onwards, he explored {{the limits of}} the traditional tonal system, which gave keys and chords their identity, pointing the way to <b>atonality</b> in the 20th century. Some music historians date the beginning of modern classical music to the first notes of Tristan, which include the so-called Tristan chord.|$|E
5|$|European {{classical}} music changed greatly in the 20th century. New music abandoned {{much of the}} historical, nationally developed schools of harmony and melody in favor of experimental music, <b>atonality,</b> minimalism and electronic music, all of which employ features that have become common to European music in general and not Italy specifically. These changes have also made {{classical music}} less accessible to many people. Important composers of the period include Ottorino Respighi, Ferruccio Busoni, Alfredo Casella, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Franco Alfano, Bruno Maderna, Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Sylvano Bussotti, Salvatore Sciarrino, Luigi Dallapiccola, Carlo Jachino, Gian Carlo Menotti, Jacopo Napoli, and Goffredo Petrassi.|$|E
5|$|Shostakovich's {{works are}} broadly tonal {{and in the}} Romantic tradition, but with {{elements}} of <b>atonality</b> and chromaticism. In some of his later works (e.g., the Twelfth Quartet), he made use of tone rows. His output is dominated by his cycles of symphonies and string quartets, each totaling fifteen works. The symphonies are distributed fairly evenly throughout his career, while the quartets are concentrated towards the latter part. Among the most popular are the Fifth and Seventh Symphonies and the Eighth and Fifteenth Quartets. Other works include the operas Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, The Nose and the unfinished The Gamblers based on the comedy of Nikolai Gogol; six concertos (two each for piano, violin and cello); two piano trios; and a large quantity of film music.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{invitation}} of Wolfgang Steinecke, Adorno {{took part in the}} Darmstadt Summer Courses for New Music in Kranichstein from 1951 to 1958. Yet conflicts between the so-called Darmstadt school, which included composers like Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luigi Nono, Bruno Maderna, Karel Goeyvaerts, Luciano Berio and Gottfried Michael Koenig, soon arose, receiving explicit expression in Adorno's 1954 lecture, [...] "The Aging of the New Music", where he argued that <b>atonality's</b> freedom was being restricted to serialism {{in much the same way}} as it was once restricted by twelve-tone technique. With his friend Eduard Steuermann, Adorno feared that music was being sacrificed to stubborn rationalization. During this time Adorno not only produced a significant series of notes on Beethoven (which was never completed and only published posthumously), but also published Mahler: A Musical Physiognomy in 1960. In his 1961 return to Kranichstein, Adorno called for what he termed a [...] "musique informelle", which would possess the ability [...] "really and truly to be what it is, without the ideological pretense of being something else. Or rather, to admit frankly the fact of non-identity and to follow through its logic to the end." ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{his time}} with The Byrds, McGuinn {{developed}} two innovative and very influential styles of electric guitar playing. The first was [...] "jingle-jangle" [...] - generating ringing arpeggios based on banjo finger picking styles he learned while at the Old Town School of Folk - which was influential in the folk rock genre. The second style was a merging of saxophonist John Coltrane's free-jazz <b>atonalities,</b> which hinted at the droning of the sitar - a style of playing, first heard on The Byrds' 1966 single [...] "Eight Miles High", which was influential in psychedelic rock.While [...] "tracking" [...] The Byrds' first single, [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", at Columbia studios, McGuinn discovered {{an important component of}} his style. [...] "The 'Ric' Rickenbacker guitar by itself is kind of thuddy," [...] he notes. [...] "It doesn't ring. But if you add a compressor, you get that long sustain. To be honest, I found this by accident. The engineer, Ray Gerhardt, would run compressors on everything to protect his precious equipment from loud rock and roll. He compressed the heck out of my 12-string, and it sounded so great we decided to use two tube compressors Teletronix LA-2As in series, and then go directly into the board. That's how I got my 'jingle-jangle' tone. It's really squashed down, but it jumps out from the radio. With compression, I found I could hold a note for three or four seconds, and sound more like a wind instrument. Later, this led me to emulate John Coltrane's saxophone on [...] "Eight Miles High". Without compression, I couldn't have sustained the riff's first note." ...|$|R
40|$|To {{celebrate}} Alexander Scriabin’s (1872 - 1915) anniversary year, his Mystic Chord {{was used}} as the primary pitch material within this work. A Mystic Complement completed the total chromatic and provided secondary pitch material used for contrast and balance. This duo for two pianos carries the listener through two movements of succinct and focused musical form. Both pianos begin playing the primary atonal material: the Mystic Chord and then the 2 nd piano plays the Mystic Complement, combining to create a 12 -tone soundworld, but effectively playing in two different <b>atonalities.</b> Before the movement ends with a final statement of the opening theme, both pianos play the six pitches of the Mystic Complement at figure N in a relaxed and melodic passage with a modal ‘quasi-blues’ feel to the atonal pitch collection. The first thematic statement holds a reference to an invisible G (Jazz melodic minor) and the final statement is in an atonal A. The melodic material at figure N outlines a clear reference to an Ab ‘atonal modality’, and so the form passes through two semi-tone modulations before resolving a whole-tone above where it started. Whilst one could not help but consciously notice references to Lutosławski’s semi-tonal formal modulations, the form (and eventual pitch-scheme) was a natural consequence of working with the Mystic Chord. Rotating through predetermined elements of the pitch matrix, the lyrical and expressive final movement starts in Chord material and ends in the Complement after passing through the total chromatic twice along the way. The form is fluid and linear with energetic crescendos and similar semi-tone modulations as the first movement. The pitch organisation produced a clear contrast between flats and naturals in the primary and secondary material and provided the catalyst for the opening (and closing) piano clusters, where syncopated rhythms separate pentachords (pentaclusters), playing all five flat notes from diatonic clusters playing all seven natural notes. There was also a notable conflict between E flat and E natural in the primary and secondary (Chord and Complement) material. This pair of notes (and similar semi-tone conflict and resolution) can be heard at pivotal formal landmarks within the movement and the pitch-scheme, it is also used to flavour the melodic contour of the writing...|$|R
5|$|Crass {{have said}} that their musical {{influences}} were seldom drawn from rock, but more from classical music (particularly Benjamin Britten, on whose work, Rimbaud states, some of Crass' riffs are based), free jazz, European <b>atonality</b> and avant-garde composers such as John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Crass influenced the anarchist movement in the UK, the US and beyond. The growth of anarcho-punk spurred interest in anarchist ideas. The band have also claimed credit for revitalising the peace movement and the UK Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Others contend that they overestimated their influence, their radicalising effect on militants notwithstanding. Crass' philosophical and aesthetic influences on 1980s punk bands were far-reaching, although few mimicked their later free-form style (heard on Yes Sir, I Will and their final recording, Ten Notes on a Summer's Day). Their painted and collage black-and-white record sleeves (by Gee Vaucher) may have influenced later artists such as Banksy (with whom Vaucher collaborated) and the subvertising movement. Anti-folk artist Jeffrey Lewis's 2007 album, 12 Crass Songs, features acoustic covers of Crass material.|$|E
5|$|Italian {{classical}} music grew gradually more experimental and progressive into the mid-20th century, while popular tastes {{have tended to}} stick with well established composers and compositions of the past. The 2004-2005 program at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples is typical of modern Italy: of the eight operas represented, the most recent was Puccini. In symphonic music, of the 26 composers whose music was played, 21 of them were from the 19th century or earlier, composers who use the melodies and harmonies typical of the Romantic era. This focus is common to other European traditions, and is known as postmodernism, a school of thought that draws on earlier harmonic and melodic concepts that pre-date the conceptions of <b>atonality</b> and dissonance. This focus on popular historical composers has helped to maintain a continued presence of {{classical music}} across {{a broad spectrum of}} Italian society. When music is part of a public display or gathering, it is often chosen from a very eclectic repertoire that is as likely to include well-known classical music as popular music.|$|E

25|$|Kundera also ventures often into musical matters, {{analyzing}} Czech folk music, {{quoting from}} Leoš Janáček and Bartók. Further in this vein, he interpolates musical excerpts into the text (for example, in The Joke), or discusses Schoenberg and <b>atonality.</b>|$|E
25|$|Serialism, {{along with}} John Cage's {{indeterminate}} music (music composed {{with the use}} of chance operations), and Werner Meyer-Eppler's aleatoricism, was enormously influential in post-war music. Theorists such as George Perle codified serial systems, and his 1962 text Serial Composition and <b>Atonality</b> became a standard work on the origins of serial composition in the work of Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern.|$|E
25|$|Operatic modernism truly {{began in}} the operas of two Viennese composers, Arnold Schoenberg and his student Alban Berg, both composers and advocates of <b>atonality</b> and its later {{development}} (as worked out by Schoenberg), dodecaphony. Schoenberg's early musico-dramatic works, Erwartung (1909, premiered in 1924) and Die glückliche Hand display heavy use of chromatic harmony and dissonance in general. Schoenberg also occasionally used Sprechstimme.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, Australian classical music erupted with influences, with composers incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from Aboriginal and south-east Asian music and instruments, to American jazz and blues, to the belated discovery of European <b>atonality</b> and the avant-garde. Composers like Don Banks, Don Kay, Malcolm Williamson and Colin Brumby epitomise this period. In recent times composers including Liza Lim, Nigel Westlake, Ross Edwards, Graeme Koehne, Julian Cochran, Georges Lentz, Elena Kats-Chernin, Richard Mills, Brett Dean and Carl Vine have embodied the pinnacle of established Australian composers.|$|E
25|$|Death metal is {{an extreme}} subgenre of heavy metal music. It {{typically}} employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or <b>atonality,</b> abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.|$|E
25|$|He {{considered}} it {{the task of}} the artist to create beauty. How the artist did this did not really matter. But originality was no virtue; personality was. Great music, like Beethoven’s, is admired because the composer’s personality shines through; Beethoven’s daring originality is now only of historical interest. However, Ryelandt was highly critical of <b>atonality,</b> claiming that the modernists’ “empty game of sound combinations brings us no interior enrichment at all,” and that the value of works like Honegger’s “unforgettable” Jeanne d'Arc au bûcher lay chiefly in their tonal passages.|$|E
25|$|Schoenberg did {{not arrive}} {{immediately}} at the serial method. His first chamber work, the string sextet Verklärte Nacht, was mostly a late German romantic work, {{though it was}} bold in its use of modulations. The first work that was frankly atonal was the second string quartet; the last movement of this quartet, which includes a soprano, has no key signature. Schoenberg further explored <b>atonality</b> with Pierrot Lunaire, for singer, flute or piccolo, clarinet, violin, cello and piano. The singer uses a technique called Sprechstimme, halfway between speech and song.|$|E
25|$|Schoenberg {{was known}} {{early in his}} career for {{simultaneously}} extending the traditionally opposed German Romantic styles of Brahms and Wagner. Later, his name would come to personify innovations in <b>atonality</b> (although Schoenberg himself detested that term) that would become the most polemical feature of 20th-century art music. In the 1920s, Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone technique, an influential compositional method of manipulating an ordered series of all twelve notes in the chromatic scale. He also coined the term developing variation and was the first modern composer to embrace ways of developing motifs without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea.|$|E
25|$|Dominick Argento (born October 27, 1927) is an American {{composer}} {{known for}} his lyric operatic and choral music. Among his best known pieces are the operas Postcard from Morocco, Miss Havisham's Fire, The Masque of Angels, and The Aspern Papers. He also is known for the song cycles Six Elizabethan Songs and From the Diary of Virginia Woolf; the latter earned him the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1975. In a predominantly tonal context, his music freely combines tonality, <b>atonality</b> and a lyrical use of twelve-tone writing, though none of Argento's music approaches the experimental avant garde fashions of the post-World War II era.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} obvious stylistic manifestation of modernism in opera is the {{development}} of <b>atonality.</b> The move away from traditional tonality in opera had begun with Richard Wagner, and in particular the Tristan chord. Composers such as Richard Strauss, Claude Debussy, Giacomo Puccini, Paul Hindemith, Benjamin Britten and Hans Pfitzner pushed Wagnerian harmony further with a more extreme use of chromaticism and greater use of dissonance. Another aspect of modernist opera is the shift away from long, suspended melodies, to short quick mottos, as first illustrated by Giuseppe Verdi in his Falstaff. Composers such as Strauss, Britten, Shostakovich and Stravinsky adopted and expanded upon this style.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1960s other strong influences emerged in Australian classical music, with composers incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from Aboriginal and south-east Asian music and instruments, American jazz and blues, to the belated discovery of European <b>atonality</b> and the avante-garde. Composers like Don Banks, Don Kay, Malcolm Williamson and Colin Brumby epitomise this period. Others who adhered to more traditional idioms include Arthur Benjamin, George Dreyfus, Peggy Glanville-Hicks and Robert Hughes. In recent times composers including Julian Cochran, Gordon Hamilton, Liza Lim, Nigel Westlake, David Worrall, Graeme Koehne, Elena Kats-Chernin, Carl Vine, Brett Dean, Martin Wesley-Smith, Georges Lentz, Richard Mills, Ross Edwards, Stephen Leek, Matthew Hindson and Constantine Koukias have embodied the pinnacle of established Australian composers.|$|E
25|$|However, operatic modernism's use of <b>atonality</b> also {{sparked a}} {{backlash}} {{in the form}} of neoclassicism. An early leader of this movement was Ferruccio Busoni, who in 1913 wrote the libretto for his neoclassical number opera Arlecchino (first performed in 1917). Also among the vanguard was the Russian Igor Stravinsky. After composing music for the Diaghilev-produced ballets Petrushka (1911) and The Rite of Spring (1913), Stravinsky turned to neoclassicism, a development culminating in his opera-oratorio Oedipus Rex (1927). Well after his Rimsky-Korsakov-inspired works The Nightingale (1914), and Mavra (1922), Stravinsky continued to ignore serialist technique and eventually wrote a full-fledged 18th-century-style diatonic number opera The Rake's Progress (1951). His resistance to serialism (an attitude he reversed following Schoenberg's death) proved to be an inspiration for many other composers.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 Eno {{released}} an album featuring heavily syncopated rhythms entitled Nerve Net, with contributions from several former collaborators including Fripp, Benmont Tench, Robert Quine and John Paul Jones. This album was a last-minute substitution for My Squelchy Life, which featured more pop oriented material, with Eno on vocals. (Several tracks from My Squelchy Life later appeared on 1993's retrospective box set Eno Box II: Vocals, {{and the entire}} album was eventually released in 2014 {{as part of an}} expanded re-release of Nerve Net.) Eno also released in 1992 The Shutov Assembly, recorded between 1985 and 1990. This album embraces <b>atonality</b> and abandons most conventional concepts of modes, scales and pitch. Much of the music shifts gradually and without discernible focus, and is one of Eno's most varied ambient collections. Conventional instrumentation is eschewed, save for treated keyboards.|$|E
25|$|Later came {{precursors}} {{of modern}} classical music. Érik Satie {{was a key}} member of the early 20th century Parisian avant-garde, {{best known for his}} Gymnopédies. Francis Poulenc's best known works are his piano suite Trois mouvements perpétuels (1919), the ballet Les biches (1923), the Concert champêtre (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera Dialogues des Carmélites (1957), and the Gloria (1959) for soprano, choir and orchestra. Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy are the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed. Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of <b>atonality.</b> The two composers invented new musical forms and new sounds. Ravel's piano compositions, such as Jeux d'eau, Miroirs, Le tombeau de Couperin and Gaspard de la nuit, demand considerable virtuosity. His mastery of orchestration is evident in the Rapsodie espagnole, Daphnis et Chloé, his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and his orchestral work Boléro (1928).|$|E
25|$|The {{arrangement}} of Matt Dennis's Everything Happens To Me (June Christy, vocal) {{was not done}} under Kenton's aegis but with Christy's later to be husband Bob Cooper as the leader just after the second AFM recording ban. This {{is added to the}} CD and shows the continuity of Graettinger's writing and recorded works for Capitol; the chart had originally been done for the full Kenton instrumentation but was never recorded. The small 11 piece group (to include violin and cello) provides some real insight to the inner workings of Graettinger's writing. The aesture nature of his arrangement and use of pantonality (one might call it <b>atonality</b> in spots) makes one wonder how June Christy is able to pick off the 9th of the F minor chord {{at the top of the}} tune; there is basically no clue given by Graettinger as to what pitch is coming for the singer (the glue that holds this together is the Bb pedal point at the bottom). Interestingly, after first stating the entire tune there is a tutti ensemble section that gives way to the 'last 'A' of the form'. Also, his harmonic transitions between sections are key in their departure from the tune compared to the established harmony while June Christy sings.|$|E
500|$|... 1909 Elektra (Strauss). This dark tragedy took Strauss's {{music to}} the borders of <b>atonality.</b> It was the composer's first setting of a {{libretto}} by his long-term collaborator Hugo von Hofmannsthal.|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1917, Hugo Leichtentritt {{described}} Busoni's mature [...] {{style as}} having elements {{in common with}} those of Sibelius, Claude Debussy, Alexander Scriabin, and Arnold Schoenberg, noting in particular his movement away from traditional major and minor scales towards <b>atonality.</b>|$|E
500|$|Donald Mitchell {{writes that}} Mahler's {{influence}} on succeeding generations of composers is [...] "a complete subject in itself." [...] Mahler's first disciples included Arnold Schoenberg and his pupils Alban Berg and Anton Webern, who together founded the Second Viennese School. Mahler's music influenced the trio's move from progressive tonalism to <b>atonality</b> (music without a key); although Mahler rejected <b>atonality,</b> {{he became a}} fierce defender of the bold originality of Schoenberg's work. At the premiere of the latter's First String Quartet in February 1907, Mahler reportedly was held back from physically attacking the hecklers. Schoenberg's Serenade, Op. 24 (1923), Berg's Three Pieces for Orchestra (1915) and Webern's Six Pieces (1928) all carry echoes of Mahler's Seventh Symphony.|$|E
500|$|Tristano's 1953 {{recording}} [...] "Descent {{into the}} Maelstrom" [...] was another innovation. It was a musical portrayal of Edgar Allan Poe's {{story of the}} same title, and was an improvised solo piano piece that used multitracking and had no preconceived harmonic structure, being based instead {{on the development of}} motifs. Its <b>atonality</b> anticipated the much later work of pianists such as Cecil Taylor and Borah Bergman.|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} his [...] "Hindustani" [...] {{period in the}} late 1940s and early 1950s {{reflects}} Chisholm's wartime travels in the East, {{his interest in the}} occult and perhaps his friendship with Sorabji. Important examples of this period are his 2nd [...] "Hindustani" [...] Piano Concerto, the Violin Concerto, the one-act opera Simoon and the Six Nocturnes, Night Song of the Bards. These compositions display luscious textures, transcendental technical demands and intensity that are comparable to works by Szymanowski and Sorabji and to some extent an <b>atonality</b> reminiscent of Alban Berg.|$|E
500|$|Whittall {{believes}} {{that one reason}} for Britten's enduring popularity is the [...] "progressive conservatism" [...] of his music. He generally avoided the avant garde, and did not challenge the conventions {{in the way that}} contemporaries such as Tippett did. Perhaps, says Brett, [...] "the tide that swept away serialism, <b>atonality</b> and most forms of musical modernism and brought in neo-Romanticism, minimalism and other modes of expression involved with tonality carried with it renewed interest in composers who had been {{out of step with the}} times". Britten defined his mission as a composer in very simple terms: composers should aim at [...] "pleasing people today as seriously as we can".|$|E
500|$|Progressive jazz {{is a form}} of {{big band}} that is more complex or experimental. It {{originated}} in the 1940s with arrangers who drew from modernist composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith. Its [...] "progressive" [...] features were replete with dissonance, <b>atonality,</b> and brash effects. Progressive jazz was most popularized by the bandleader Stan Kenton during the 1940s. Critics were initially wary of the idiom. Dizzy Gillespie wrote in his autobiography; [...] "They tried to make Stan Kenton a 'white hope,' called modern jazz and my music 'progressive,' then tried to tell me I played 'progressive' music. I said, 'You're full of shit!' 'Stan Kenton? There ain't nothing in my music that's cold, cold like his." ...|$|E
500|$|Sorabji {{has been}} {{described}} as a conservative composer who developed a highly idiosyncratic style fusing diverse influences. Even so, parallels have been identified between him and more progressive composers. Ullén describes Sorabji's Études transcendantes (100) (1940–44) as pieces that might be seen as [...] "presages of the piano music of, say, Ligeti, Finnissy or Ferneyhough", although he cautions against overstating this. Some of Sorabji's pieces have even been described as forerunners of the music of Nancarrow. According to Habermann, [...] "The rhythmic structures within brackets [...] predate the complicated rhythms of Messiaen and Stockhausen." [...] Habermann also argues that Sorabji's fusion of tonality and <b>atonality</b> into a different approach to relationships between harmonies is a significant innovation.|$|E
500|$|American {{composer}} Michael Ching wrote a one-act English-language sequel, Buoso's Ghost, {{which had}} its first full staging with the Pittsburgh Opera in 1996, and its official premiere at Opera Memphis in 1997. Starting where Gianni Schicchi ends, the new opera, with a libretto by the composer, opens with Schicchis final chords and carries the plot forward by following the sinister dealings of Buoso Donati's family, who apparently had poisoned Buoso, and the continued machinations of Schicchi, who tries to exploit this growing suspicion on his part. Opera News noted that Ching uses [...] "a more modern musical mode, yet avoiding excessive <b>atonality.</b> The score subtly introduces brief tongue-in-cheek quotations from other works, ranging from Mozart to Sondheim, plus one unmistakable interjection of Shostakovich." [...] It has been performed throughout the U.S., paired with Gianni Schicchi.|$|E
500|$|Busoni was an {{outstanding}} (if sometimes controversial) pianist {{from an early}} age. He began composing in his early years in a late romantic style, but after 1907, when he published his Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music, he developed a more individual style, often with elements of <b>atonality.</b> His visits to America led to interest in [...] North American indigenous tribal melodies which were reflected {{in some of his}} works. His compositions include works for piano, including a monumental Piano Concerto, and transcriptions of the works of others, notably Johann Sebastian Bach which appeared in the Bach-Busoni Edition. His other compositions include chamber music, vocal and orchestral works, and also operas, one of which, Doktor Faust, was left unfinished {{at the time of his}} death. Busoni died in Berlin at the age of 58.|$|E
500|$|The work is scored for a four-part choir, with often divided voices, and an {{orchestra}} of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, three timpani and more percussion, organ, and strings. In the final movement, an additional brass ensemble of four trumpets and four trombones plays the cantus firmus of Luther's chorale [...] "". Reger used Lutheran hymns often in his work, {{in the tradition}} of Johann Sebastian Bach. He had written already a chorale fantasia on the hymn, Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott, Op. 27 in 1898. Reger's harmonies are advanced and at times close to <b>atonality,</b> but he claimed that he did nothing that Bach had not done before: harmonies {{as the result of the}} polyphon individual lines (Stimmführung).|$|E
500|$|Much of Janáček's work {{displays}} great originality and individuality. It {{employs a}} vastly expanded view of tonality, uses unorthodox chord spacings and structures, and often, modality: [...] "there is no music without key. <b>Atonality</b> abolishes definite key, and thus tonal modulation....Folksong knows of no atonality." [...] Janáček features accompaniment figures and patterns, with (according to Jim Samson) [...] "the on-going {{movement of his}} music...similarly achieved by unorthodox means; often a discourse of short, 'unfinished' phrases comprising constant repetitions of short motifs which gather momentum in a cumulative manner." [...] Janáček named these motifs [...] "sčasovka" [...] in his theoretical works. [...] "Sčasovka" [...] has no strict English equivalent, but John Tyrrell, a leading specialist on Janáček's music, describes it as [...] "a little flash of time, almost a kind of musical capsule, which Janáček often used in slow music as tiny swift motifs with remarkably characteristic rhythms {{that are supposed to}} pepper the musical flow." [...] Janáček's use of these repeated motifs demonstrates a remote similarity to minimalist composers (Sir Charles Mackerras called Janáček [...] "the first minimalist composer").|$|E
