Finally, opinions differ on whether the verb has a passive or a middle voice and how it is expressed.|$|E
500|$|Contrary to his {{statements}} to Patton, Eisenhower never seriously considered removing the general from {{duty in the}} European Theater. Writing of the incident before the media attention, he said, [...] "If this thing ever gets out, they'll be howling for Patton's scalp, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the end of Georgie's service in this war. I simply cannot let that happen. Patton is indispensable to the war effort– one of the guarantors of our victory." [...] Still, following the capture of Messina in August 1943, Patton did not command a force in combat for 11 months.|$|E

500|$|The art {{direction}} of the album was handled by Chris Bilheimer with photography from Marina Chavez and Karl Koch. The album cover was shot between band practices and featured Mikey Welsh, Rivers Cuomo, Brian Bell and Patrick Wilson standing left to {{right in front of}} a plain, lime-green backdrop {{in a manner similar to}} the band's debut album. This was done as a tribute to Ric Ocasek, who had also produced their first album, and also to symbolize the band's back-to-basics approach they took while recording the album. This approach is alluded to in a quote in the liner notes of the album: [...] "Torniamo all'antico e sarà un progresso", from Italian opera composer Giuseppe Verdi that means [...] "Let us return to old times <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> progress." ...|$|E
500|$|Themes of {{corruption}} and salvation are brought to the fore as Valérie and Crevel lie dying from the mysterious poison. When his daughter urges him {{to meet with a}} priest, Crevel angrily refuses, mocking the church and indicating that his social stature will be his salvation: [...] "la mort regarde à deux fois avant de frapper un maire de Paris!" [...] ("Death thinks twice of it before carrying off a Mayor of Paris.") Valérie, meanwhile, makes a deathbed conversion and urges Bette to abandon her quest for revenge. Ever the courtesan, Valérie describes her new Christianity in terms of seduction: [...] "je ne puis maintenant plaire qu'à Dieu! je vais tâcher de me réconcilier avec lui, ce sera ma dernière coquetterie!" [...] ("I can please no one now but God. I will try to be reconciled to Him, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> my last flirtation...!") ...|$|E
500|$|The result marked Manchester United's first Shield {{defeat in}} 13 years, {{and was the}} ninth time Arsenal had won the Charity Shield. Arsenal became the first {{southern}} club since Tottenham Hotspur in 1962 to win the Shield outright. Wenger described the scoreline as [...] "unexpected" [...] and cited the first goal as crucial in the match, given the weather conditions. He was content with how his international players, {{who had been in}} the World Cup, coped with the game's physicality. Wenger believed the result gave Arsenal a psychological boost for the Champions League campaign, as the club planned to stage their home matches at Wembley Stadium. Bergkamp felt the result showed that Arsenal had what it took to retain the Premier League title: [...] "We've still got the same mentality <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the basis for this year's challenge. This is a good start. It is harder to retain the trophy." ...|$|E

As a result of these measures, he was able to announce {{at the end of the}} year when delivering the budget that the Government had achieved a surplus of $1 million. He initiated the setting up of the Economic Development Board which was established in August 1961 to attract foreign multinational corporations to invest in Singapore. The next year, he started the development of the Jurong industrial estate on the western end of the island which was then a swamp, offering incentives to local and foreign business to locate there. According to former Permanent Secretary Sim Kee Boon, Goh admitted that the Jurong project was [...] "an act of faith and he himself jokingly said that this could prove to be Goh's folly".
