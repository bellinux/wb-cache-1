5|$|The Comet {{appears in}} the sky, and Azula's {{coronation}} takes place. Azula banishes nearly all of her subjects, haunted by the betrayals of former friends Mai and Ty Lee. Her paranoia and loneliness begin to drive her insane. Before she is crowned, Zuko and Katara arrive. Zuko accepts Azula's challenge to a one-on-one duel because he realizes Azula is distracted {{and he does not}} want Katara injured. Just as Zuko {{is on the verge of}} defeating Azula, she shoots <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> at an unprepared Katara. Zuko throws himself in front of her and intercepts the lightning, preventing Katara from getting hurt, but gravely injuring himself.|$|E
5|$|One night, Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian {{travel to}} the ocean surface to watch a celebration for the {{birthday}} of Prince Eric on a ship. Ariel instantly becomes enamored with Eric. A violent storm arrives, with <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> striking the ship, engulfing it in flames and eventually destroying it, tossing Eric overboard. She rescues Eric and brings him to shore. Ariel sings to Eric, but immediately leaves just as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Fascinated {{by the memory of}} her voice, Eric vows to find who saved and sang to him, and Ariel vows {{to find a way to}} join him and his world. When Triton discovers Ariel's love for Eric, Triton confronts her in the grotto and destroys most of the artifacts with his trident. After Triton leaves, two eels named Flotsam and Jetsam convince Ariel to visit Ursula, a sea witch.|$|E
5|$|Osborn had {{assembled}} {{a team of}} supervillains, which included Gargan, newly bonded with the Venom symbiote. However, Mary Jane had contacted SHIELD, and the villains were faced not only by Spider-Man, but the combined might of Captain America, Iron Man, Yellowjacket, Daredevil and the Fantastic Four. During the fracas, the Green Goblin manages to escape and kidnap Mary Jane Watson, taking her to the George Washington Bridge in order to replay his murder of Gwen Stacy. However, a drugged Doctor Octopus intervenes, attacking the Green Goblin. Spider-Man is able to save Mary Jane after <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> sends the two villains into the river. Following some verbal clues from the Green Goblin, Peter also discovers where he had hidden Aunt May, and rescues her as well. It is revealed that Osborn sent Peter a letter before the fight, thanking Peter for giving his life meaning and purpose, but Peter never received the letter due to moving from his residence. After this battle, Osborn attempts to escape to Paris, but is apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.|$|E
6000|$|Little Ev, thus {{recalled}} {{to things}} about him, looked around in alarm. The girls questioned {{each other with}} glances of dismay. The sky had grown very black, and the peals of thunder came louder and more continuously. <b>A</b> jagged <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> hurtled over the horizon. Over land and sea was [...] "the green, malignant light of coming storm." ...|$|R

50|$|Seven years ago, Lopplc and Morina {{were playing}} at a park. Suddenly they felt an {{earthquake}} on the Koya Koya Planet. The quake was so massive {{that the planet}} was destroyed. Everyone had to escape using a giant ship. <b>A</b> sudden <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> damaged the ship, causing a power failure. The Professor (who was Morina's father) wanted to fix the spaceship, but another lightning strike took him to another dimension him.|$|R
5|$|Snake {{continues}} his mission, destroying the facility and the Shagohod tank, while engaging Volgin, who is killed by <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> during the battle. Snake and EVA travel to a lake, where a WIG ground effect vehicle is hidden. Before {{they use it}} to escape the region, Snake confronts his old mentor, The Boss, whom he must assassinate to complete his mission. After an emotional battle, The Boss gives Snake the microfilm containing {{the location of the}} Philosopher's Legacy, and requests Snake to kill her. Soon after, Snake overcomes his feelings and kills The Boss, emerging victorious. He and EVA escape to Alaska, and spend the night together as they make love. During the night, EVA disappears with the microfilm, and leaves behind a tape revealing herself to be a Chinese spy sent to steal the Philosopher's Legacy for China. The tape continues, and EVA reveals that The Boss did not defect to the Soviet Union; rather, she was under orders to pretend to defect so she could infiltrate Volgin's ranks and find the location of the Legacy, which could be brought back to America. The final part of her mission was to sacrifice her honor and die at the hands of Snake, under the guise of a traitor, to prove the U.S.'s innocence in Volgin's nuclear attack during the Virtuous Mission.|$|E
5|$|There, Marty {{encounters}} the teenaged George, who is bullied by his classmate Biff. After Marty saves George from {{an oncoming}} car and is knocked unconscious, he awakens {{to find himself}} tended to by an infatuated Lorraine. Marty leaves and tracks down Doc's younger self to help him return to 1985. With no plutonium, Doc explains that the only power source capable of generating the necessary 1.21 gigawatts of electricity for the time machine is <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning.</b> Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that recounts a lightning strike at the town's courthouse the coming Saturday night. Doc instructs Marty to not leave his house or interact with anyone, as he could inadvertently {{change the course of}} history and alter the future; because of this, Doc refuses to heed warnings from Marty about his death in 1985. Marty realizes that he has prevented his parents from meeting and Doc warns Marty that he will be erased from existence if he does not find a way to introduce George to Lorraine. Doc formulates a plan to harness the power of the lightning while Marty sets about introducing his parents, but he antagonizes Biff and his gang in the process.|$|E
5|$|For {{the final}} {{destruction}} of the Genesis planet, footage from the Paramount set had to be carefully matched with ILM effects footage. ILM built scale miniatures cut into sections to portray parts of Genesis' upheaval (rock slides, fissures opening in the ground) that live-action scenes could not easily replicate. One of the largest miniatures, measuring , had trick trees and trapdoors that could be reset, propane jets for gusts of fire, and solenoid-triggered rockfalls. For scenes where Kirk and Kruge battle at a precipice over a pit of lava, the shot combined animated lava, clouds (really cotton daubs on black), lightning, and a matte painting. Overhead shots of the lava were created by lighting a piece of clear Plexiglass with colored gels and covering the plate with methacyl, vermiculite and charcoal; the mixture dripped off the surface and coated the crew underneath. ILM simulated Kruge's demise, a long plunge into the pool of lava, {{with the help of}} a stop-motion puppet. Lloyd fell a few feet onto a black mattress; during a lighting flash the actor was replaced by the puppet that fell the rest of the distance. Because the shot was filmed on black instead of the traditional bluescreen, the animators had to remove or rotoscope the black background around Lloyd one frame at a time. The transition between the footage of Lloyd and the puppet was hidden by a single-frame flash as <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> struck Kruge. The scene of Kirk and Spock beaming away as the ground collapses was another created at ILM, as the level of destruction was simply not possible for the live action crew.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, when Tony Cicoria was 42 years old, he {{was struck}} by {{lightning}} near Albany, New York, while standing next to a public telephone. He had just {{hung up the phone and}} was about a foot away when <b>a</b> rogue <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> struck. He recalled seeing his own body on the ground surrounded by a bluish-white light. Cicoria’s heart had apparently stopped, but he was resuscitated by a woman, (coincidentally an intensive-care-unit nurse) who was waiting to use the telephone.|$|R
50|$|It was {{at about}} that time Superman showed up to help the police break up the event. Willis' fans showed support for her by {{throwing}} stuff at the Man of Steel, when suddenly, lightning struck the stage, setting it on fire. Superman pushed Willis to safety as <b>a</b> second <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> electrified the metal tower on the stage; the electricity ran through Superman's body and into a wire on stage which Willis then stepped on, shocking Willis and changing her appearance.|$|R
50|$|Amyas {{spends time}} in the Caribbean coasts of Venezuela seeking gold, and {{eventually}} returns to England {{at the time of}} the Spanish Armada, finding his true love, the beautiful Indian maiden Ayacanora, in the process; yet fate had blundered and brought misfortune into Amyas's life, for not only had he been blinded by <b>a</b> freak <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> at sea, but he also loses his brother Frank Leigh and Rose Salterne, who were caught by the Spaniards and burnt at the stake by the Inquisition.|$|R
25|$|In July 1941, during World War II, {{the head}} of the statue was knocked off by <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning.</b> In 1947, {{sculptor}} Roger Hedley (the son of painter Ralph Hedley) created a new head based on the preserved fragments of the original.|$|E
25|$|The story {{ends with}} Madame de Lorsagne {{relieving}} {{her from a}} life of vice and clearing her name. Soon afterward, Justine becomes introverted and morose, and is finally struck by <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> and killed instantly. Madame de Lorsagne joins a religious order after Justine's death.|$|E
25|$|A {{determined}} Lapitch, {{guided by}} Yana and her wise advice, comes {{to terms with}} the villain's schemes. Dirty Rat is so enraged that his horse charges straight at the little mouse, about to trample him. At the last moment, <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> splits the harness; the Rat and his cart fall down a cliff, encased in huge boulders, Dirty Rat is presumably dead.|$|E
50|$|Like the 4th Airborne Division, the 5th Airborne Division {{was given}} its own insignia. This {{took the form}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bright blue <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning,</b> formed by five zig-zags on a dark red square. In 1945 this was {{replaced}} by the standard insignia used by the 1st, 2nd & 6th Airborne Divisions.|$|R
50|$|Set in {{the early}} 22nd century, the film opens with the {{destruction}} of a space cruise liner that becomes irreparably damaged and destroyed by <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> nebular <b>lightning.</b> The only apparent survivors are three beautiful women - Nova (Cali Timmins), Reena (Aleisa Shirley), and Meagan (Deborah Pratt) - who get away in an escape pod and land on the nearest habitable planet. There, they are quickly accosted by the hostile natives and taken aboard a sail-driven vehicle resembling a pirate ship on rails.|$|R
50|$|During Norman Osborn's Siege of Asgard, it is {{revealed}} that Daken intended {{to turn on}} Osborn. He appears to murder him, but this was later revealed to be a hallucination caused by the Asgardian divinities who represent fate. Daken attempts to fight Thor, who strikes him down with <b>a</b> massive <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> before the two can even face off. Once the Siege ends with the Void's death, Osborn's Avengers are rounded up and arrested. Daken {{is the only one}} to escape, doing so by killing and disguising himself as an army soldier.|$|R
25|$|The {{production}} of X-rays by <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> was theoretically predicted {{as early as}} 1925 but no evidence was found until 2001/2002, when researchers at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology detected X-ray emissions from an induced lightning strike along a grounded wire trailed behind a rocket shot into a storm cloud. In the same year University of Florida and Florida Tech researchers used an array of electric field and X-ray detectors at a lightning research facility in North Florida to confirm that natural lightning makes X-rays in large quantities during the propagation of stepped leaders. The cause of the X-ray emissions is still a matter for research, as the temperature of lightning is too low {{to account for the}} X-rays observed.|$|E
25|$|In the Bundahishn, a cosmological fable {{completed}} in the 12th century, the opposition is established during the creation: {{the second phase of}} the war between creation (with its guardians) and Angra Mainyu (MP→ Ahriman) is over control of the waters and of the rains. In this war (Bundahishn 7.8-10, and Zadspram 6.9-11), Apaosha is assisted by Spenjagr, who is however defeated by <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning.</b> On the opposing front, Tishtrya is supported by Verethragna (→ Vahman), Haoma (→ Hom), Apam Napat (→ Burz), the hordes of the fravashis and by the Vayu (→ Weh). In the Bundahishn, Apaosha is identified with the planet Mercury, the astrological opposition to Sirius being a product of the contact with Chaldea, and which may be a lingering trace of the Zurvanite doctrine that places stars in opposition to planets.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, Kong is dropped next to Godzilla at {{the summit}} of Mt. Fuji and the two engage in a final battle. Godzilla {{initially}} has the advantage due to its atomic breath and nearly kills Kong. After knocking Kong out with a devastating dropkick and tail smacks to the head, Godzilla begins burning the foliage around Kong trying to cremate him. Suddenly <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> from thunder clouds strike King Kong reviving him and charging him up. The monsters continue their fight with the revitalized King Kong beating up Godzilla. Kong continues to throw rocks to attack Godzilla as Godzilla uses its atomic breath to keep Kong at a distance. The two monsters destroy Atami Castle and both fall off a cliff together into the Pacific Ocean. After an underwater battle, only Kong resurfaces. Kong begins to swim towards his island home. There {{is no sign of}} Godzilla, but the JSDF speculates that it is possible that it survived. The JSDF decides not to pursue Kong but, rather, let him return home.|$|E
50|$|Josiah's wife, Minnie, {{became the}} first female {{postmaster}} in American history. She was also a schoolteacher, but was killed instantly by <b>a</b> freak <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> not far {{from her home in}} 1922. The horse she was riding on was also killed. Her 14-year-old son, Albert, and his baby sister, Catherine, were riding with their mother that day, but were unharmed. Albert ran home crying that his mother had been hurt, so his father grabbed his rifle and went for his wife, thinking she had been attacked by bandits.|$|R
50|$|When the Mother storm {{crossed the}} Stone Gardens, <b>a</b> single <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> hit one <b>of</b> the {{floating}} rocks. This then grew {{to the size}} of the original Sanctaphrax rock, and was named New Sanctaphrax. Cowlquape then became the Most High Academe of the new city. However, the rock was soon stricken by Stone-Sickness, causing a great rift in the now sinking city. The Earth-Scholars believed that the cure was to be found in the Deepwoods. The Sky-Scholars believed that the rock needed to be struck by lightning, conducted through a great metal spike.|$|R
50|$|The most {{critical}} injuries {{are to the}} circulatory system, the lungs, and {{the central nervous system}} but injuries also occur to other body systems. Some victims suffer immediate cardiac arrest and will not survive without prompt emergency care. It is safe to administer care immediately, because the victim will not retain any electrical charge after the <b>lightning</b> has struck (<b>of</b> course, the rescuer could be struck by <b>a</b> separate <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning).</b> Other victims may suffer myocardial infarction and various cardiac arrhythmias, most of which can be rapidly fatal as well. Loss of consciousness is very common immediately after a strike. Amnesia and confusion of varying duration often result as well.|$|R
25|$|Uatu {{reveals the}} only way to defeat Doom is to acquire a piece of the M'Kraan Crystal and steal the Muonic Inducer from Galactus (who is {{currently}} attacking the Skrull homeworld). The team is sent to the Shi'ar Empire where they fight Deathbird and the Imperial Guard in order to restore Lilandra Neramani to the throne and gain a portion of the M'Kraan Crystal. After retrieving the crystal, the heroes travel to the Skrull homeworld {{and with the help of}} the Silver Surfer, the heroes disable Galactus and steal the Muonic Inducer. Meanwhile, Doctor Doom conquers Earth, corrupting and creating clones of many of the heroes. In a final effort, the team travels to Latveria to confront Dr. Doom. The heroes use the M'Kraan Crystal and Muonic Inducer to weaken Doom. As the heroes weaken Doom, he is blasted by <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> sent by a rejuvenated Odin, leaving nothing but his mask behind. As the heroes meet on the repaired Helicarrier, Nick Fury informs the heroes that the team must disband and asks if S.H.I.E.L.D. can count on them when another threat happens. Captain America assures Nick that the world can count on them. Meanwhile, Galactus vows revenge on the heroes who stole from him and plans to destroy Earth.|$|E
25|$|Asclepius, {{the son of}} Apollo and Koronis, {{learned the}} secrets of keeping death at bay after observing one serpent {{bringing}} another (which Asclepius himself had fatally wounded) back to life with healing herbs. To prevent the entire human race from becoming immortal under Asclepius's care, Zeus killed him with <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning.</b> Asclepius' death {{at the hands of}} Zeus illustrates man's inability to challenge the natural order that separates mortal men from the gods. In honor of Asclepius, snakes were often used in healing rituals. Non-poisonous snakes were left to crawl on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept. The Bibliotheca claimed that Athena gave Asclepius a vial of blood from the Gorgons. Gorgon blood had magical properties: if taken from {{the left side of the}} Gorgon, it was a fatal poison; from the right side, the blood was capable of bringing the dead back to life. However, Euripides wrote in his tragedy Ion that the Athenian queen Creusa had inherited this vial from her ancestor Erichthonios, who was a snake himself and had received the vial from Athena. In this version the blood of Medusa had the healing power while the lethal poison originated from Medusa's serpents.|$|E
25|$|Scouts are {{masters in}} the art of moving unseen. The scout’s primary weapons are two daggers, and {{he has the ability to}} become {{temporarily}} invisible and assassinate units instantly from behind with a sneak attack. As a secondary attack, he carries satchel bombs filled with blasting powder as a ranged attack. The scout can also block melee attacks. Finally, Mages serve as the magic class. A mage's primary attack is <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning,</b> which can be charged up for a more powerful attack that can also damage other enemies in close proximity to the target. He also wields a “firewall” attack, which creates an expanding circle of flames that will heavily damage if not kill enemies who are within the circle. For close range attacks, they have a shockwave attack, which knocks enemies back and allows the mage to finish them off with his staff. Mages can also heal allies. For defensive purposes, a mage can create a magical shield around himself to protect anyone inside from ranged attacks of any sort, provided the attacker is outside of the shield, which allows people to walk through. While the shield ability is active, the mage is unable to do anything else and is therefore highly vulnerable to melee attacks.|$|E
50|$|After {{retrieving}} {{the first}} suitor's gift, she hits {{the man with}} <b>a</b> magical <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> from her hand, turning him into a pile of sand, and takes his jewels to wear on her teeth as a grill. Another suitor brings her candy, cupcakes, twinkies, and spicy cheese puffs. After she burns her mouth with the spicy cheese puffs, she turns the suitor into a large cup of water, which she drinks. Pätra also appears as a gray statue in a scene where golden pythons and gray guardian statues such as Anubis, Horus, Nisroch and Apep surround her, and in a scene with a blue background where she wears a golden dress and several golden hieroglyphs levitate around her.|$|R
50|$|When Circe {{called upon}} her unseen lover for aid, <b>a</b> {{powerful}} <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> {{came down from}} the sky. Wonder Woman used both her bracelets to deflect the lightning, but they were fused together. As she had just had her bracelets bound by a man, she was rendered powerless until she persuaded Griggs, trapped {{in the form of a}} ram/man hybrid, to charge her and use the force of his collision to break the bracelets apart. Wonder Woman deflected more lightning bolts, unwittingly sending the fiery bolts to burn down Circe's patch of immortality-granting herbs. Tezcatlipoca then imprisoned Circe in his obsidian mirror, turned Wonder Woman into a powerless Diana Prince, and revealed himself.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the much}} greater {{distance}} to ground, the positively charged region can develop considerably larger levels of charge and voltages than the negative charge regions in {{the lower part of}} the cloud. Positive lightning bolts are considerably hotter and longer than negative lightning. They can develop six to ten times the amount of charge and voltage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> negative <b>bolt</b> and the discharge current may last ten times longer. <b>A</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> positive <b>lightning</b> may carry an electric current of 400 kA and the potential at the top of the cloud may exceed a billion volts — about 10 times that <b>of</b> negative <b>lightning.</b> During a positive lightning strike, huge quantities of extremely low frequency (ELF) and very low frequency (VLF) radio waves are generated.|$|R
