5000|$|The house {{resembles a}} Spanish Colonial {{architectural}} style. Its ground floor {{was made of}} large adobe stones while the second floor was made of hardwood. The {{lower part of the}} house consists of series of adobe posts with Ionic columns covering {{the sidewalk in front of}} it. The <b>arcaded</b> <b>sidewalk</b> was caused by a mandate from the city government of Manila after the 1863 earthquake. This feature was also reflected on structures built along San Fernando street in Binondo, San Sebastian (now R. Hidalgo street) in Quiapo and Calzada de Iris (part of the present C.M. Recto) in Sampaloc.|$|E
50|$|Construction of the {{downtown}} section, which began in December 1949, presented several challenges. The new superhighway had to be carried above Clinton and Canal and Streets, through the Post Office at a level similar to surrounding streets, and across the South Branch of the Chicago River on twin bascule-type drawbridges. East of the river, ramps connected to Franklin Street and two levels of Wacker Drive {{before the end of}} controlled access at Wells Street. The platforms of LaSalle Street Station required new supports for creation of an underpass for Congress Parkway. More than two dozen buildings were cleared for the new street, including the 13-story Monon and 12-story Caxton Buildings on Dearborn Street, part of Printer's Row. East of State Street, <b>arcaded</b> <b>sidewalks</b> were cut into existing buildings, including the Auditorium Theater, to allow six lanes of auto traffic.|$|R
50|$|In 1952, Congress Parkway was widened, {{bringing}} the curb {{to the southern}} edge of the building. To make room for a sidewalk, some ground-floor rooms and part of the theater lobby were removed and a <b>sidewalk</b> <b>arcade</b> created.|$|R
50|$|All of the {{exhibition}} pieces are made out of flags measuring 3 m in height and 1.8 m in width, which are then hung from the <b>arcade</b> over the <b>sidewalks.</b> This was the first flag art event in Japan and has been occurring yearly since 1997.|$|R
60|$|I {{despair of}} giving you any real {{notion of the}} capitals, but if you {{remember}} the White City at the Columbian Fair at Chicago in 1893, you can have {{some idea of the}} general effect of one; only there is nothing heterogeneous in their beauty. There is one classic rule in the architecture, but each of the different architects may characterize an edifice from himself, just as different authors writing the same language characterize it by the diction natural to him. There are suggestions of the capitals in some of our cities, and if you remember Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, you can imagine something like the union of street and garden which every street of them is. The trolleys run under the overarching trees between the lawns, flanked by gravelled footpaths between flower-beds, and you take the cars or not as you like. As there is no hurry, they go about as fast as English trams, and the clanger from them is practically reduced to nothing by the crossings dipping under them at the street corners. The centre of the capital is approached by colonnades, which at night bear groups of great bulbous lamps, and by day flutter with the Altrurian and Regionic flags. Around this centre are the stores and restaurants and theatres, and galleries and libraries, with <b>arcades</b> over the <b>sidewalks,</b> like those in Bologna; sometimes the arcades are in two stories, as they are in Chester. People are constantly coming and going in an easy way during the afternoon, though in the morning the streets are rather deserted.|$|R
6000|$|Those of my {{readers who}} have frequented {{the garden of}} Doctor Rappaccini no doubt recall with perfect {{distinctness}} the quaint old city of Padua. They remember its {{miles and miles of}} dim <b>arcade</b> over-roofing the <b>sidewalks</b> everywhere, affording excellent opportunity for the flirtation of lovers by day and the vengeance of rivals by night. They have seen the now-vacant streets thronged with maskers, and the Venetian Podestà going in gorgeous state to and from the vast Palazzo della Ragione. They have witnessed ringing tournaments in those sad empty squares, and races in the Prato della Valle, and many other wonders of different epochs, and their pleasure makes me half-sorry that I should have lived for several years within an hour by rail from Padua, and should know little or nothing of these great sights from actual observation. I take shame to myself for having visited Padua so often and so familiarly as I used to do,--for having been bored and hungry there,--for having had toothache there, upon one occasion,--for having rejoiced more in a cup of coffee at Pedrocchi's than in the whole history of Padua,--for having slept repeatedly in the bad-bedded hotels of Padua and never once dreamt of Portia,--for having been more taken by the salti mortali[Salti mortali are those prodigious efforts of mental arithmetic by which Italian waiters, in verbally presenting your account, arrive at six as the product of two and two.] of a waiter who summed up my account at a Paduan restaurant, than by all the strategies with which the city has been many times captured and recaptured. Had I viewed Padua only over the wall of Doctor Rappaccini's garden, how different my impressions of the city would now be! This is one of the drawbacks of actual knowledge. [...] "Ah! how can you write about Spain when once you have been there?" [...] asked Heine of Théophile Gautier setting out on a journey thither.|$|R
