5|$|A {{design team}} {{was formed in}} 1946 under the {{leadership}} of chief designer Ronald Bishop, who had been responsible for the Mosquito fighter-bomber. A number of unorthodox configurations were considered, ranging from canard to tailless designs; all were subsequently rejected. The Ministry of Supply was, however, interested in the most radical of the proposed designs and ordered two experimental tailless DH 108s to serve as proof of concept aircraft for testing swept-wing configurations in both low-speed and high-speed flight. During flight tests, the DH 108 gained a reputation for being <b>accident-prone</b> and unstable, leading de Havilland and BOAC to gravitate to conventional configurations and, necessarily, designs with less technical risk. The DH 108s were later modified to test the DH 106's power controls.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{arrived at}} Belfast, Northern Ireland, on 19 July {{to begin a}} lengthy refit to convert her into a {{submarine}} depot ship that lasted until 4 October. Nine days later, Fearless sailed for Murmansk, Russia, and arrived there on the 19th {{to serve as the}} depot ship for several British G-class submarines based there. The ship sailed back to Britain on 15 November, together with all three of her submarines. By January 1917 she was the leader of the 12th Submarine Flotilla of the Grand Fleet, made up of the notoriously <b>accident-prone</b> K-class steam-powered submarines, that was based at Scapa Flow. From 3–17 March, Fearless was refitted at Invergordon. On 17 July, she and her flotilla transferred to Rosyth, Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar abiotrophy (CA or CCA). Recessive disorder, {{homozygous}} {{horses are}} affected, carriers show no signs. An affected foal is usually born without clinical signs, {{but at some}} stage, usually after six weeks of age, develops severe incoordination, a head tremor, wide-legged stance and other symptoms related {{to the death of}} the purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Such foals are frequently diagnosed only after they have crashed into a fence or fallen over backwards, and often are misdiagnosed as suffering from a head injury caused by an accident. Severity varies, with some foals having fast onset of severe coordination problems, others showing milder signs. Mildly affected horses can live a full lifespan, but most are euthanized before adulthood because they are so <b>accident-prone</b> as to be dangerous. As of 2008, there is a genetic test that uses DNA markers associated with CA to detect both carriers and affected animals. Clinical signs are distinguishable from other neurological conditions, and a diagnosis of CA can be verified by examining the brain after euthanasia.|$|E
5|$|The {{surge of}} air travellers, catalyzed by {{low-cost}} carriers {{and the rise}} of air-transport demands among Indonesia's rising middle class, has put intense stress on Indonesia's aging airports. Nevertheless, there has been some efforts to improve and upgrade airport facilities, such as the construction of Medan's brand-new Kuala Namu Airport to replace the overwhelmed, aging, and <b>accident-prone</b> Polonia Airport. Other newly built airports include Lombok Airport, replacing the old Selaparang Airport in Lombok; and Minangkabau Airport, replacing the old Tabing Airport in Padang. Existing airports that have undergone massive expansion and upgrades include Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali, Juanda Airport in Surabaya, and Sultan Hasanuddin Airport in Makassar. There are plans to build a second Bali airport in Kubu Tambahan near Singaraja, northern Bali, a new larger airport in Kulon Progo near Yogyakarta to replace the crowded and overwhelmed Adisutjipto Airport, and Kertajati Airport in Kertajati, Majalengka, to replace Bandung's Husein Sastranegara Airport and also to serve the vicinity of Cirebon. To improve transportation interconnectivity, the government plans to build railways connecting airports all over Indonesia with nearby city centers. Currently, only Kuala Namu and Adisutjipto airports have a railway connection to the city center, while airport railways are currently under construction in Soekarno–Hatta and Minangkabau airports.|$|E

25|$|Until June 12, 2009, {{a section}} of I-40 through {{downtown}} Knoxville between James White Parkway and Hall of Fame Drive was completely closed to all traffic for about 18 months for reconstruction. Through traffic was required to use I-640 or to use surface streets. The four-lane section, which was quite substandard, congested, and <b>accident-prone,</b> was widened to six lanes to improve traffic flow and safety. Several interchanges along that stretch were also reconstructed.|$|E

25|$|An {{abbreviated}} {{version of}} A Midsummer Night's Dream {{was made into}} an animated short (with the same title) by Walt Disney Television Animation in 1999 {{as part of the}} Mouse Tales series. It was featured in a 2002 episode of Disney's House of Mouse ("House of Scrooge", Season 3, Episode 34). The star-crossed lovers are played by Mickey Mouse (Lysander), Minnie Mouse (Hermia), Donald Duck (Demetrius), and Daisy Duck (Helena). The character based on Theseus is played by Ludwig Von Drake, and the character based on Egeus by Scrooge McDuck. Goofy appears as an <b>accident-prone</b> Puck. The story ends with the revelation that it was a dream experienced by Mickey Mouse while sleeping at a picnic hosted by Minnie.|$|E
25|$|The fire service, {{known as}} the Barun Yantra Karyalaya, opened its first station in Kathmandu in 1937 with a single vehicle. An iron tower was erected to monitor the city and watch for fire. As a precautionary measure, firemen {{were sent to the}} areas which were {{designated}} as <b>accident-prone</b> areas. In 1944, the fire service was extended to the neighboring cities of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur. In 1966, a fire service was established in Kathmandu airport. In 1975, a West German government donation added seven fire engines to Kathmandu's fire service. The fire service in the city is also overlooked by an international non-governmental organization, the Firefighters Volunteer Association of Nepal (FAN), which was established in 2000 with the purpose of raising public awareness about fire and improving safety.|$|E
25|$|Tim is a stereotypical American male, {{who loves}} power tools, cars, and sports. In particular, {{he is an}} avid fan of local Detroit teams. In {{numerous}} instances, Tim wears Lions, Pistons, Red Wings, and Tigers clothing, and many plots revolve around the teams. He is a former salesman for the fictional Binford Tool company, and {{is very much a}} cocky, overambitious, <b>accident-prone</b> know-it-all. Witty but flippant, Tim jokes around a lot, even at inappropriate times, much to the dismay of his wife. However, Tim can sometimes be serious when necessary. Jill, Tim's wife, is loving and sophisticated, but not exempt from dumb moves herself. In later seasons she returns to college to study psychology. Family life is boisterous for the Taylors with the two oldest children, Brad and Randy, tormenting the much younger Mark, all while continually testing and pestering each other. Such play happened especially throughout the first three seasons, and was revisited only occasionally until Jonathan Taylor Thomas left {{at the beginning of the}} eighth season. During the show's final season, Brad and Mark became much closer due to Randy's absence.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Thomas S. Murphy {{delegated}} {{his position}} as president to Daniel B. Burke while remaining ABC's chairman and CEO. Capital Cities/ABC reported revenues of $465 million. Now at a strong second place, the network entered the 1990s with additional family-friendly hits including America's Funniest Home Videos (which {{has gone on to}} become the longest-running prime time entertainment program in the network's history), Step by Step, Hangin' with Mr. Cooper, Boy Meets World and Perfect Strangers spinoff Family Matters, as well as series such as Doogie Howser, M.D., Life Goes On, cult favorite Twin Peaks and The Commish. In September 1991, the network premiered Home Improvement, a sitcom starring stand-up comic Tim Allen centering on the family and work life of an <b>accident-prone</b> host of a cable-access home improvement show. Lasting eight seasons, its success led ABC to greenlight additional sitcom projects helmed by comedians during the 1990s including The Drew Carey Show; Brett Butler vehicle Grace Under Fire; and Ellen, which became notable for a 1997 episode which served as the coming out of series star Ellen DeGeneres (as well as her character in the series) as a lesbian.|$|E

500|$|The English comic, {{singer and}} actor George Formby (1904– 1961) {{performed}} in many mediums of light entertainment, including film, radio and theatre. His career spanned from 1915 until December 1960. During {{that time he}} became synonymous with playing [...] "a shy, innocent, gauche, <b>accident-prone</b> Lancashire lad".|$|E
500|$|As one {{contemporaneous}} journalist observed, [...] "Spider-Man has {{a terrible}} identity problem, a marked inferiority complex, and {{a fear of}} women. He is anti-social, [...] castration-ridden, racked with Oedipal guilt, and <b>accident-prone</b> ... functioning neurotic". Agonizing over his choices, always attempting to do right, he is nonetheless viewed with suspicion by the authorities, who seem unsure {{as to whether he}} is a helpful vigilante or a clever criminal.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{earliest}} characters Formby developed was [...] "John Willie". Baz Kershaw, the professor of theatre, described the character as Formby's [...] "onstage alter ego", while the cultural historian Jeffrey Richards describes Willie as [...] "the archetypal gormless Lancashire lad in baggy trousers, tight jacket, and bowler hat, slow-talking, hen-pecked, <b>accident-prone,</b> but muddling through." [...] His costume included ill-fitting clothes, large boots worn on the wrong feet, {{and a variety of}} hats; he would often carry a cane. In 1908 he lent one of his costumes to a young Charlie Chaplin when the latter was touring with Fred Karno's troupe; Chaplin also incorporated Formby's cane twirl and duck-like walk into his act.|$|E
500|$|Formby {{was born}} into poverty in the {{industrial}} north west of England; his mother was an alcoholic and part-time prostitute, and during much of his youth he was maltreated. To earn money he would sing for pennies on street corners, before he joined a singing duo in his teens. He began to develop his own act during the 1890s and built up a following in Lancashire. He also developed a series of stage characters, including that of [...] "John Willie", which is described by the cultural historian Jeffrey Richards as [...] "the archetypal gormless Lancashire lad... hen-pecked, <b>accident-prone,</b> but muddling through." [...] Formby also had a successful recording career and made the transition from music hall to revue in 1916.|$|E
500|$|The formula {{used for}} No Limit was {{repeated}} in his following works: Formby played [...] "the urban 'little man' defeated—but refusing to admit it". He portrayed a good-natured, but <b>accident-prone</b> and incompetent Lancastrian, who was {{often in a}} skilled trade, or the services. The plots were geared to Formby trying to achieve success in a field unfamiliar to him (in horse racing, the TT Races, as a spy or a policeman), and by winning the affections of a middle-class girl in the process. Interspersed throughout each film {{is a series of}} songs by Formby, in which he plays the banjo, banjolele or ukulele. The songs are, {{in the words of the}} academic Brian McFarlane, [...] "unpretentiously skilful in their balance between broad comedy and action, laced with... shy ordinariness".|$|E
500|$|From Greigsville, {{the route}} heads west through open land into the {{northeast}} corner of Wyoming County and the town of Covington. At Peoria, the highway turns to head due northwest, its direction for the next [...] The bend at Peoria was once a sharp, <b>accident-prone</b> turn known as Peoria Curve; however, the route has been slightly realigned to the north to create a longer, more gradual curve. From Peoria, NY63 runs across rolling, open terrain to the Genesee County line and the town of Pavilion. Just past the county line, the route connects to the northern end of NY246. A mile (1.6km) beyond, NY63 drops down slightly to intersect with NY19 at the hamlet of Pavilion. After the traffic light {{at the center of the}} hamlet, NY63 crosses Oatka Creek and climbs back up out of the Wyoming Valley.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, {{a few years}} after the {{completion}} of the arterial, the Rhode Island Department of Public Works (RIDPW) proposed a relocation of Route2, which, at the time, was the major thoroughfare in the area. No action was taken until 1964, when the RIDPW introduced a study for the [...] "Relocated Route2" [...] proposal. During the study, drivers who used the Colonel Rodman Highway arterial and were bound for the state capital of Providence were redirected onto Route2, an <b>accident-prone,</b> four-lane undivided highway near the modern exit5. In 1965, the planned Route2 freeway was given the new number of Route4, leaving Route2 on its existing alignment. A public hearing was held by the state of Rhode Island on the proposed freeway, which was to be four lanes and have a divided, grassy median. This proposal was later accepted, and construction began two years later.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the highway}} was {{designed}} and built to what were, at the time, high standards, with a 100-foot (30 m) wide right-of-way in most places, it was <b>accident-prone</b> because it lacked a median barrier. One segment of the so-called [...] "Bloody Bayshore" [...] was [...] "Boneyard Hill", a steep grade through the Visitacion Valley near the San Francisco city line, running past a bone meal plant. Causes of the crashes included turning conflicts at intersections, and speeding drivers crossing the centerline to use the oncoming lanes as a passing lane. The roadway was entirely at-grade except for crossings of rail lines. It generally followed the present alignment of the Bayshore Freeway, but deviated in several places: Old Bayshore Highway in San Jose, Veterans Boulevard in Redwood City, Bayshore Highway in Burlingame, a destroyed section of road through San Francisco International Airport, and Airport and Bayshore Boulevards from South San Francisco through Brisbane into San Francisco. Within that city, the new highway continued three miles (5km) along the present Bay Shore Boulevard to Army (Cesar Chavez) Street and Potrero Avenue.|$|E
500|$|The {{cul-de-sac}} kids do {{not include}} the Eds as part of their group, making the trio outcasts. The group of kids include: Jonny 2×4 (David Paul [...] "Buck" [...] Grove) is a loner whom his peers consider to be a nuisance, and {{spends most of his time}} with his imaginary friend, a wooden board named Plank; Jimmy (Keenan Christensen) is a weak, insecure, and <b>accident-prone</b> child, who is most often seen spending his time with Sarah (Janyse Jaud), Ed's spoiled and ill-tempered younger sister; Rolf (Peter Kelamis) is an immigrant, who often participates in unconventional customs; Kevin (Kathleen Barr) is a cynical and sardonic jock who detests the Eds, particularly Eddy; Nazz (Tabitha St. Germain; Jenn Forgie; Erin Fitzgerald), usually seen with Kevin, is a stereotypical dumb blonde and an unattainable love interest for the cul-de-sac kids. All of the cul-de-sac kids share a common fear of the Kanker Sisters, Lee (Janyse Jaud), May (Erin Fitzgerald; Jenn Forgie), and Marie (Kathleen Barr), three teenage girls who live in a nearby trailer park and are in love with the Eds.|$|E
500|$|Law {{believes}} that the general standard of production design and special effects is {{lower than that of}} , expressing satisfaction with the scale models but suggesting that [...] "the slow-motion filming and wobbly mirror effects are more in keeping with Blake's 7." [...] He views the [...] "info dump" [...] opening titles as a weak imitation of the Space: 1999 introduction, and the multiple appearances of the E=mc2 equation as confusing. Certain props (such as the slide rule) and design elements (such as punched cards) also come under criticism from Law, who questions whether a futuristic [...] "lightship" [...] would be equipped with such relatively primitive technology. Although he suggests that the plot device of the <b>accident-prone</b> Altares reflects the shifting public perception of space exploration in the 1970s ("a time when optimism in the space programme was on the wane"), Law regards such design elements as indicative of the manner in which The Day After Tomorrow [...] "has {{stood the test of time}} less well than other series." ...|$|E
500|$|Of {{the three}} schools, St. Lulim has the least {{emphasis}} on romance between characters, although the Lulim characters are typically found together. The leader of their friendly group is Chikaru Minamoto, the student council president of Lulim, and a born leader. She has a friendly and supportive personality which she often uses to offer advice {{or simply a}} shoulder to cry on. The other three girls include Kizuna Hyūga, a very outgoing and excitable girl who enjoys following Chikaru's decisions, finding fun in doing so. She is very expressive in her actions and words, not wasting a chance to introduce herself to anyone new. Her close friend is Remon Natsume, who is much like Kizuna in personality, but is not as <b>accident-prone</b> as her. Of the pair, Kizuna is the more talkative; Remon often agrees with her companion and will offer up an opinion when need be. Lastly, there is Kagome Byakudan, {{the youngest of the}} group, who is typically accompanied by her stuffed bear [...] which she often talks to as if it were alive. Although she does not talk or express her emotions much, she has a heightened perception of others' emotions and can tell when those around her are distraught or in emotional pain.|$|E
500|$|David Kronke of the Los Angeles Daily News {{wrote that}} the show [...] "returns to its wicked wit, dialing back but {{certainly}} not eradicating the melodrama." [...] He complimented the four main actresses for their comedic relief and concluded: [...] "Rarely does a show unjump the shark this well; it's back in fine form, calibrating its humor and its menace just right." [...] New York Daily News writer David Bianculli compared the premiere to the show's second season, noting that the episode showed [...] "an assurance and a knowing playfulness that was missing most of last year." [...] He complimented Cherry and Greenstein's script and approved the storylines for each character. Bianculli opined that the episode returned {{the quality of the}} show's first season and concluded: [...] "Pass the word: If you've given up on 'Desperate Housewives,' it's time to return to the neighborhood." [...] Entertainment Weekly Lindsay Soll identified Eva Longoria as the episode's strongest performer, declaring that she [...] "definitely looks like the one to watch this season." [...] Soll was glad to see that the Susan character was [...] "a little more toned down and less <b>accident-prone</b> than usual," [...] and called the scenes with Susan and Mike touching. Additionally, she opined that Laurie Metcalf [...] "did a brilliant job of playing the classic TV nosy neighbor," [...] but expressed her confusion over the Orson storyline.|$|E

2500|$|In horses, the {{symptoms}} may worsen {{from the time}} of onset for six to 12 months, but if not severe enough to mandate euthansia, they stabilize over time. In some dog breeds, symptoms appear to progressively worsen, but research is not consistent on this point.

[...] Horses may experience difficulty stepping up and over objects, run into fences, fall easily, and even if allowed to mature to full growth, are generally considered unsafe to ride. Dogs may need lifetime assistance with tasks such as climbing stairs.|$|E
