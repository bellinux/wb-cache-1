50|$|The {{station is}} unstaffed {{and has a}} basic shelter on its single active platform. There is no ticket machine, so all tickets must be bought on the train or in <b>advance.</b> <b>Timetable</b> poster and a digital {{information}} screen are provided to offer train running information. Step-free access is via a ramp from the main entrance.|$|E
5000|$|According to the CWB, the {{government}} <b>advanced</b> the <b>timetables</b> to Christmas 2011, prompting them {{to launch a}} protest campaign urging Canadians as well as farmers {{to speak out against}} {{the government}}'s decision to end the Single Desk. Meanwhile, the government issued leaflets explaining what would [...] "bring marketing freedom." ...|$|R
50|$|Operation Lumberjack {{succeeded in}} {{clearing}} the Rhine north of Mosel of effective German forces. The Allies destroyed four corps of the German 15th and 7th Armies. The {{capture of the}} bridge at Remagen was an unexpected bonus that <b>advanced</b> the <b>timetable</b> for crossing the Rhine. Patton and Bradley were able to move up their scheduled crossings of the Rhine.|$|R
50|$|Alton Blackwood {{has killed}} on a 33-day cycle. John {{believes}} {{that on the}} next cycle {{he will try to}} kill John’s family; however, the spirit <b>advances</b> the <b>timetable</b> and attacks early. Numerous people are possessed including the drug-addicted son of Calvino's housekeepers, child-killer Melody Lane, reporter Roger Hodd, and the children's math tutor, Professor Sinyavski. All four attack John’s family in their house. John’s family fights against the possessed people.|$|R
5|$|The Australian 7th and 9th Divisions {{converged on}} Lae, which fell on 16 September. MacArthur <b>advanced</b> his <b>timetable,</b> {{and ordered the}} 7th to capture Kaiapit and Dumpu, while the 9th mounted an amphibious assault on Finschhafen. Here, the {{offensive}} bogged down, partly because MacArthur had based his decision to assault Finschhafen on Willoughby's assessment that there were only 350 Japanese defenders at Finschhafen, when in fact there were nearly 5,000. A furious battle ensued.|$|R
25|$|Vasey's Australian 7th Division and Wooten's 9th Division {{converged on}} Lae, which fell on September 16. MacArthur <b>advanced</b> his <b>timetable,</b> {{and ordered the}} 7th Division to capture Kaiapit and Dumpu, while the 9th Division mounted an amphibious assault on Finschhafen. Here, the {{offensive}} bogged down. Part {{of the problem was}} that MacArthur had based his decision to assault Finschhafen on Willoughby's assessment that there were only 350 Japanese defenders at Finschhafen when there were actually nearly 5,000.

5000|$|In {{order to}} fully benefit {{the company and}} employee, the {{induction}} programme should be planned in <b>advance.</b> The <b>timetable</b> should be prepared, detailing the induction activities for a set period of time (ideally at least a week) for the new employee, including a named member of staff who {{will be responsible for}} each activity. This plan should be circulated to everyone involved in the induction process, including the new starter. If possible it should be sent to the new starter in advance, if not co-created with the new starter ...|$|R
40|$|Increasing the {{precision}} in timetable planning {{is a key}} success factor for all infrastructure managers, since {{it allows us to}} minimize delay propagation without reducing usable capacity. Since most running time calculation models are based on standard and deterministic parameters an imprecision is implicitly included, which has to be compensated by running time supplements. At the same time, GPS or even more precise trackings are continuously stored in the event recorders of most European trains. Unfortunately, this large amount of data is normally stored but not used except for failure and maintenance management. To consider real running time variability in running time calculation, an approach has been developed, which allows us to calibrate a performance factor for each motion phase. Given the standard motion equation of a train, and a mesoscopic model of the line, the tool uses a simulated annealing optimisation algorithm to find the best regression between calculated and measured instant speed. To increase precision, the motion is divided into four phases: acceleration, braking at stops, braking for speed reductions/signals and cruising. By performing the procedure over a number of train runnings, a distribution of each performance parameter is obtained. Once the infrastructure model is defined and the trackings are imported, the procedure is completely automated. The approach can be used in both stochastic simulation models and as a basis for <b>advanced</b> <b>timetable</b> planning tools, where stochastic instead of deterministic running times are used. The tool has been tested in the north-eastern part of Italy as input for both running time calculation and microscopic simulation...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{video-on-demand}} transmissions {{is essentially}} divided into periodic broadcasting methods and on-demand methods. Periodic broadcasting is aimed to schedule transmissions off-line, so that an optimized time schedule is achieved. On {{the other hand}} video-ondemand {{has to deal with}} constraints at requesting times. Thus, studies on these areas have been quite isolated. Obviously, in periodic broadcasting all parameters are known in <b>advance,</b> so <b>timetables</b> can be accurately adjusted and it is assumed transmissions can be arranged to use less bandwidth than video-on-demand. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of both paradigms, showing that the claims that argue that VoD schemes use more bandwidth than PB ones are not necessarily true. We state this argument by proving how to convert any periodic broadcasting method into an on-demand one, which will use equal or less bandwidth. Moreover, we show that this converted on-demand method can also offer shorter serving times...|$|R
30|$|Northern France to Spain (N-S) {{link between}} Dourges and Perpignan: {{commenced}} July 2008; six 45 -ft containers are typically loaded in each direction. Space is shared on existing (public) train services, to provide 2 connections per day. From Perpignan, the containers travel to a drop lot in Mataró in Spain, where incoming and outgoing containers are pooled. This way the truck can drop and reload without any waiting time. Distribution centres {{and the production}} plant in the Mataró area are handled by a separate local loop. Knowing in <b>advance</b> the exact <b>timetable</b> of these trains, P&G has managed to maintain the same or improved transit time, compared to a direct, truck-only route.|$|R
5000|$|India {{insisted on}} the disbandment of the 'Azad forces' as an [...] "essential condition" [...] before the plebiscite, which, {{according}} to Korbel, came as [...] "jolt" [...] to the Commission. This was indeed agreed in the previous round. However India appeared to have <b>advanced</b> the <b>timetable.</b> The so-called 'Azad forces' were {{made up of the}} demobilised soldiers of the British Indian Army belonging to the Poonch and Mirpur districts. They rose in revolt against the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir prior to the tribal invasion. Following the invasion, Pakistan organised the soldiers into 32 battalions of a serious military force and used them to fight the Indian forces. During the truce discussions, Pakistan insisted on a balance between the Azad forces and the State forces, and demanded that Pakistan be allowed to train the Azad forces to take the positions that the Pakistani forces would vacate. This led the Indians to conclude that Pakistan was planning to resume hostilities as soon as the Indian withdrawal began. Thus they demanded that the disbandment of Azad forces should occur during the truce stage itself. Pakistan rejected the demand for disbandment and insisted on parity between the Azad and State forces. Pakistan also wished to see the detailed plans of the Indian withdrawal and insisted that it should be [...] "synchronized" [...] with the Pakistani withdrawal.|$|R
