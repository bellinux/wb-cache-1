5|$|During the {{company-wide}} crossover Infinite Crisis (2005), Oracle {{teams with}} the Martian Manhunter in Metropolis to coordinate a counterstrike against the Secret Society's global jailbreak. The renewed romance between Barbara Gordon and Dick Grayson is <b>also</b> <b>cut</b> short by the Infinite Crisis storyline.|$|E
5|$|After the {{revisions}} were completed, much of {{the plot}} stayed the same, but several events in the original draft were cut out to strengthen the whole book. Stead combined two characters into one, having a stronger outline and <b>also</b> <b>cut</b> out several scenes for minor characters. In the end, Stead found that the revisions helped to make the book more cohesive.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{during the}} All-Star Week, Williams was {{diagnosed}} of thrombocytopenia {{and was out}} for the remaining games of the entire conference. With his absence, his team {{did not last long}} and was eliminated by the Burger King Whoopers. He was <b>also</b> <b>cut</b> from the training pool for the national team because of his illness.|$|E
50|$|Finally, the GR 11 {{footpath}} <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> {{across the}} commune {{from east to}} west.|$|R
50|$|The video <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> away to show Darius {{walking the}} streets looking for someone.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Girl Through Glass", Stephen pushes Holly {{through a}} solid pane of glass, and <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> her in half.|$|R
5|$|Steaks are <b>also</b> <b>cut</b> from grazing animals, usually farmed, {{other than}} cattle, {{including}} bison, camel, goat, horse, kangaroo, sheep, ostrich, pigs, reindeer, turkey, deer and zebu {{as well as}} various types of fish, especially salmon and large pelagic fish such as swordfish, shark and marlin. For some meats, such as pork, lamb and mutton, chevon and veal, these cuts are {{often referred to as}} chops. Some cured meat, such as gammon, is commonly served as steak.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{was furious}} {{over what he}} saw as {{potentially}} precedent-setting papal interference in his royal authority, and initially refused to allow Murdac into England. When Theobald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, went to consult with the Pope on the matter against Stephen's wishes, the King refused to allow him back into England either, and seized his estates. Stephen <b>also</b> <b>cut</b> his links to the Cistercian order, and turned instead to the Cluniacs, of which Henry was a member.|$|E
5|$|De Laurentiis {{felt the}} only way to save the {{production}} was to find a new director and have the script rewritten. The other production companies were not content with De Laurentiis stopping production, which led Les Films Marceau-Cocinor to terminate its contract with Italy Film. A.S. Film Produccion confiscated the footage and took cameras, costumes, and weapons that had been rented by Italy Film, which nearly bankrupted the company. De Laurentiis restarted production with financial backing from distributor Paramount Pictures, and hired Mario Bava as director. The budget was <b>also</b> <b>cut</b> to 200 million lire, {{less than half of the}} original budget.|$|E
50|$|Mr. Rogers gets {{a haircut}} while {{discussing}} with the barber how it doesn't hurt. The same barber <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> Corny's hair.|$|R
5000|$|Second, {{she found}} that the second factor <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> against fair use, because [...] "the copyrighted musical {{compositions}} and sound recordings are creative in nature." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lehigh Tunnel, on the Northeast Extension of the PA turnpike, <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> through Blue Mountain; but {{was given}} a {{different}} name to prevent confusion with the Blue Mountain tunnel farther west.|$|R
5|$|Favio {{damaged the}} court in the resort town of Vilanculos in Southern Mozambique. Uprooted trees caused by the cyclone also blocked roads, cutting off access for rescuers to some homes. Power was <b>also</b> <b>cut</b> off to the city. The cyclone killed four people and injured at least 70 in the town, and {{thousands}} of homes were destroyed along with the hospital, where a total of 120patients were evacuated. Additionally, 600prisoners escaped when the local jail was demolished. About 80% of the town was destroyed. A total of 73,000people were affected by the cyclone in Vilanculos.|$|E
5|$|HBO did {{not make}} a {{decision}} for four months after the pilot was delivered. In March 2010, HBO's decision to greenlight the series including the pilot was announced, with the production of the series scheduled to start June 2010. HBO however demanded extensive reshoot of the pilot, and wanted all the scenes from Morocco scrapped. A cameo appearance by George RR Martin as a Pentoshi nobleman at Daenerys's wedding filmed in Morocco was therefore <b>also</b> <b>cut.</b> In all 90 percent of the pilot was re-shot in 2010, with some cast changes and a different director.|$|E
5|$|In 1753, Marquis Duquesne, the Governor of New France, sent another, larger expedition. At present-day Erie, Pennsylvania, {{an advance}} party built Fort Presque Isle. They <b>also</b> <b>cut</b> a road {{through the woods}} and built Fort Le Boeuf on French Creek, from which it was {{possible}} at high water to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny. The following year, they built Fort Machault at that site.|$|E
5000|$|Part of the rap {{section was}} used in the 1990 Ween song [...] "L.M.L.Y.P.". Prince's [...] "No!" [...] scream intro <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> the word [...] "shit" [...] on their 1993 song [...] "Push th' Little Daisies".|$|R
5000|$|Oana Pellea as Alex's mother. Her throat is slashed near to {{decapitation}} as {{she tries}} to use the phone to call for help. The Killer <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> off her hand for trying to use the phone.|$|R
50|$|The film <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> away to {{footage of}} the Queens on the town having fun. For one night only, eight years later, the ladies {{returned}} to Mo'Nique for a comeback on The Mo'Nique Show which aired on October 29, 2009.|$|R
5|$|In July, {{the corps}} {{was rushed to}} the Villers-Cotterêts area in {{preparation}} for the Third Battle of the Aisne, the first major Allied counteroffensive of the year. There, it was put under the French Tenth Army and given administrative command of the 1st Division and the 2nd Division which were previously under command of the French XX Corps. However, the command group arrived in the area too late to exercise tactical command, and it was instead attached to the French XX Corps. On 18 July, the attack was launched, with the force spearheading the French Tenth Army's assault on the high ground south of Soissons. During this attack, the Corps <b>also</b> <b>cut</b> rail lines supplying the German Army.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Puerto Cabezas, {{population}} 60,000, meteorologists expected a direct hit. Local authorities announced a curfew to prevent looting. The government <b>also</b> <b>cut</b> off electricity throughout the small coastal city to prevent injuries. Evacuations were limited, and the most vulnerable of the population weathered the storm in poorly constructed shelters. To {{be able to respond}} to an emergency following Beta, the government of Nicaragua requested relief supplies for 41,866 families which would last 15 days. These supplies consisted of 98,000lb (44,452kg) of cereals, 628,600lb (285,128kg) of beans, 628,600lb (285,128kg) of corn, 125,7200lb (57,025kg) of rice, 44,500lb (20,184kg) of sugar, 171,600lb (77,836kg) of salt, 4,929gal (18,658L) of cooking oil, 324,900lb (147,372kg) of milk and 21,264 blankets.|$|E
5|$|In the italic, the {{expansive}} ascenders of Tagliente's type were shortened and the curl {{to the right}} replaced with more conventional serifs. Monotype <b>also</b> <b>cut</b> italic capitals sloped to match the lower-case, whereas in the Renaissance italics were used with upright capital letters in the Roman inscriptional tradition. The bold (Monotype's invention, since Griffo and his contemporaries did not use bold type) is extremely solid, providing a very clear contrast to the regular styles, and Monotype also added lining (upper-case height) figures {{as well as the}} text figures (at lower-case height) used in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.|$|E
5000|$|The Postforming Machine, {{that not}} only heats and forms the {{laminate}} around the substrate, but <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> away the backsplash (when the top {{is to be used}} against a wall) from the main deck, all in a feed-through motion machine.|$|R
5000|$|The radio edit {{version of}} the 7" [...] single rearranges the song somewhat, the second verse being taken from the {{original}} first verse, and the original second verse being removed completely. It <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> out the introduction at the beginning.|$|R
5000|$|Manufacturers receive {{sheets of}} steel pre-cut for the widths required. The sheets are fed through a {{roll-forming}} machine {{to create a}} [...] "U" [...] or [...] "V" [...] shape. The roll-forming machine <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> the supports to the length required.|$|R
5|$|McEvilly {{started his}} career with non-League side Burscough, rising through their youth ranks to the senior side, where he made 49 league appearances, scoring 28 goals. In December 2001, Third Division club Rochdale signed him for £20,000. From 2004 to 2009 he had spells in the Conference National and League Two with Accrington Stanley, Cambridge United and Wrexham. Since 2009, McEvilly has {{struggled}} with injuries and has had brief spells at numerous non-league clubs in England and Wales, {{as well as a}} brief period at League of Ireland side Sligo Rovers in 2010, which was <b>also</b> <b>cut</b> short due to injury. He is currently playing with Barrow for the third time, with whom he won the FA Trophy in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the show, the {{producers}} from WCW/Turner Broadcasting System made several changes to the format, including reducing the overall time by 40 minutes. This forced AAA to change the first three matches from the traditional best-of-three falls to a single fall. The producers <b>also</b> <b>cut</b> back on the elaborate entrances that AAA usually had for their major shows and did not allow AAA to have a dark match before the broadcast started to rev up the crowd. The producers also pushed to change the semi-main event to a singles match between El Hijo del Santo and Eddie Guerrero, but in the end, the match went on as originally planned and advertised.|$|E
5|$|Richard Maunsell was {{appointed}} CME of the SECR in 1913, following {{the retirement of}} Harry Wainwright due to ill health. Wainwright left a legacy of competent but unspectacular locomotives that struggled {{to cope with the}} increased train lengths and loadings. Maunsell took control of the short-term situation by improving existing designs, and he introduced new engines to progressively replace obsolete classes. New designs could <b>also</b> <b>cut</b> costs on the SECR, as one capable mixed-traffic locomotive could undertake the work of two separate passenger or freight types. The first new design was to become Maunsell's Nclass 2-6-0.|$|E
50|$|The Anthony Road {{constructed}} by the Hydro during {{the construction of the}} Anthony Power Scheme <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> through {{the northern part of the}} range, as well as access to the glacial lakes in The Tyndalls - Lake Westwood, Lake Selina and Lake Julia.|$|R
30|$|The {{results show}} that trading not only reduces the total {{operation}} cost, but <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> down the expenditure of each individual MG. This is because MG 3 achieves revenue by selling energy whereas MG 1 and MG 2 decrease their cost by purchasing energy.|$|R
50|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Jack (The Camera Guy) Edinger, features William walking around snow-covered streets {{in his neighborhood}} and Oak Park, and <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> to him playing the guitar several times. The video was released on December 22, 2008 via The William Beckett Blog and YouTube.|$|R
5|$|The game's {{original}} concept {{included an}} underground base that connected {{all of the}} levels, but this element was scrapped by publisher Psygnosis due to financial constraints. Several additional levels were <b>also</b> <b>cut</b> from the game due to time restrictions, including one inspired by Prince of Persia (1989). Following Walkers launch in February 1993, Dunlop began working on a port for the Mega Drive, which was cancelled shortly thereafter. Glancy was also recruited {{to work on a}} sequel, Walker 2, which would have overhauled the visual quality of the first game and include a customisable mech. Planned for release on the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, it was eventually cancelled.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, May 24, {{they set}} out again, but stopped for breakfast after about three miles. As they {{finished}} eating, about 30 warriors approached. The men retreated, but four were shot and killed. Slain with St. Vrain were John Fowler, William Hale, and Aaron Hawley. An account of the massacre from Gen. George W. Jones, who was St. Vrain's brother-in-law {{and the man who}} identified his body, said the warriors had scalped the dead men, but <b>also</b> <b>cut</b> off the hands, head, and feet of St. Vrain and removed his heart. They reportedly passed around pieces of the heart for the braves to eat. At least one source indicated that the mutilation began before St. Vrain was dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} edit {{was almost}} three hours long; to hone it to 141 minutes, Eastwood cut {{material from the}} first part of the film to get to Collins' story sooner. To improve the pacing he <b>also</b> <b>cut</b> scenes that focused on Reverend Briegleb. Eastwood deliberately left the ending of the film ambiguous to reflect the uncertain fates of several characters in the history. He said that while some stories aimed to finish at the end of a film, he preferred to leave it open-ended.|$|E
5000|$|The River Unk {{originates}} {{in and then}} flows through the parish. Offa's Dyke <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> north-south through the area, bisecting the hamlet of Churchtown. The long-distance footpaths [...] "Shropshire Way" [...] and [...] "Offa's Dyke Path" [...] pass through the area and join just outside Churchtown.|$|R
50|$|The {{mattress}} is vacuum {{packed and}} folded into a compact box, and {{can therefore be}} easily delivered and moved up staircases, unlike traditional mattresses. When unpacked, the mattress recovers its original shape and is ready to sleep on within hours. This method <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> the delivery cost.|$|R
50|$|Ohio State Routes 303 and 44 {{pass through}} Shalersville and {{intersect}} {{at the middle}} of the township. The Ohio Turnpike <b>also</b> <b>cuts</b> through Shalersville, and in the 1990s the exit at State Route 44 was added. The Portage County Airport is located {{in the southern part of}} the township.|$|R
