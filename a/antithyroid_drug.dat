Use of <b>antithyroid</b> <b>drugs</b> in the week before the onset of illness was compared in 262 patients with agranulocytosis and 1771 controls. Forty five patients (17 %) and five controls (0. 3 %) had used <b>antithyroid</b> <b>drugs.</b> The relative risk was estimated to be 102 (95 % confidence interval 38 to 275) taking into account confounding by other factors, including the use of other drugs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} adjunctive <b>antithyroid</b> <b>drugs</b> on the risk of treatment failure, hypothyroidism, and adverse events after radioiodine treatment. DESIGN: Meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (Cochrane central register of controlled trials, Medline, Embase) searched to August 2006 and contact with experts. Review methods Three reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality. Pooled relative risks for treatment failure and hypothyroidism after radioiodine treatment with and without adjunctive <b>antithyroid</b> <b>drugs</b> were calculated with a random effects model. RESULTS: We identified 14 relevant randomised controlled trials with a total of 1306 participants. Adjunctive antithyroid medication was associated with an increased risk of treatment failure (relative risk 1. 28, 95 % confidence interval 1. 07 to 1. 52; P= 0. 006) and a reduced risk for hypothyroidism (0. 68, 0. 53 to 0. 87; P= 0. 006) after radioiodine treatment. We found no difference in summary estimates for the different <b>antithyroid</b> <b>drugs</b> or for whether <b>antithyroid</b> <b>drugs</b> were given before or after radioiodine treatment.

Methods. Patients who visited our hospital {{for the treatment of}} hyperthyroidism were included (n = 207). Treatment consisted of antithyroid medications, radioactive iodide, thyroidectomy, or a combination of these treatment options. Patients were retested 3 - 6 years later to evaluate long-term effects of <b>antithyroid</b> <b>drugs.</b> Patients were tested for the presence of ANCA and, if positive, evaluated for the presence of AAV. Results. Of 209 patients with hyperthyroidism, 12 patients (6 %) were positive for myeloperoxidase- (MPO-), proteinase 3 -, or human leukocyte elastase-ANCA. Seventy-seven of 209 patients were retested; 1 patient who had not been treated with <b>antithyroid</b> <b>drugs</b> had developed MPO-ANCA.

40|$|Background: Antithyroid {{drugs have}} been used for more than 50 years for the {{management}} of hyperthyroidism. Most patients tolerate treatment well but some may develop life threatening side effects such as agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia (AA). We review all cases of <b>antithyroid</b> <b>drug</b> induced AA and describe, as illustrative cases, two women with Graves' disease who developed AA after 8 and 24 weeks of carbimazole (CBM) and methimazole (MMI) treatment respectively. Patient findings and summary: To date, at least 34 cases of aplastic anemia (AA) due to antithyroid drugs [(1 with CMZ, 31 with MMI, and 2 with propylthiouracil (PTU) ] have been published, not including the two patients described here. In addition, at least another 14 patients in whom AA developed after treatment with antithyroid drugs (11 with CMZ, and 3 with MMI) have been reported in Yellow Card Scheme data analysis. Patients with AA usually exhibit sudden onset of symptoms after a relative short time of exposure to the drugs, and all have concomitant agranulocytosis. Most have a rapid recovery following discontinuation of the drug and supportive treatment. Although only two <b>antithyroid</b> <b>drug</b> induced AA deaths have been published, the mortality rate was higher in the Yellow Card Scheme data analysis. Conclusions: Aplastic anemia associated with <b>antithyroid</b> <b>drug</b> treatment is rarer than <b>antithyroid</b> <b>drug</b> associated agranulocytosis. The prognosis of patients with <b>antithyroid</b> <b>drug</b> induced AA is good overall, but may not be as favorable as that of <b>antithyroid</b> <b>drug</b> induced isolated agranulocytosis...|$|E
