25|$|Alan and Dale are two {{of three}} {{children}} born to Larry and Carol Klapmeier. They come from an entrepreneurial family. The eldest brother, Ernie Klapmeier, opened his own accessory store of military reenactment goods and regalia in Aurora, Illinois and has managed the shop {{since its founding in}} 1997; their uncle, Jim Klapmeier, and grandfather, Elmer Klapmeier, were both entrepreneurs in the boat manufacturing industry and started as a small, two-person company building pontoon-like houseboats on Rainy Lake, Minnesota throughout the 1950s. Elmer ran a second business flying a single-engine 'puddle jumper' plane around Wisconsin delivering parts to dairy farmers, while Jim later moved the boat project to a facility in Mora, Minnesota where he grew and retained it for several decades, transitioning into the market of luxury yachts. Larry and Carol were also entrepreneurs who founded a successful nursing home near Chicago, of which the three brothers worked at <b>as</b> <b>kids</b> doing janitorial chores during the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Before the book's publication, Heather Lauer was {{a public}} affairs {{consultant}} in Arizona. She hatched the idea {{to write a book}} about bacon after going out for cocktails with her two brothers in 2005. [...] Lauer explained to The Arizona Republic: [...] "I was out drinking with my brothers one night, and the topic of bacon came up. We had eaten bacon <b>as</b> <b>kids,</b> and bacon was a special thing on Sunday mornings. Somehow, the idea came up about how funny it would be to start a blog about bacon... I took it and ran with it." [...] She began the blog Bacon Unwrapped, at www.baconunwrapped.com, and a social networking site about bacon at baconnation.ning.com in 2005.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Party" [...] was {{directed}} by Beyoncé and Alan Ferguson. As reported by Rap-Up, Beyoncé filmed the clip in the Oakdale Mobile Home Park in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, on August 2, 2011. The video shoot called for multiple flashy fashions, a red muscle car, and colorfully dressed dancers. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé's younger sister, and Kelly Rowland, former Destiny's Child member, both made cameos. Rowland elaborated a bit about {{her role in the}} video in an interview with NeonLimelight: [...] "I'm just doing a cameo. We just had a really good time [...] While filming the video, we noticed that we were doing certain stuff that we used to do <b>as</b> <b>kids.</b> We kinda felt a little goofy for a second, so we stopped. But we just had a good time.". Model Shaun Ross also makes a cameo in the video.|$|E
500|$|During an ABC News interview, {{president}} of Creatures Inc. Tsunekazu Ishihara gave {{insight into the}} brainstorming process for developing new Pokémon species. He explained, [...] "The ideas {{for each of these}} monsters came from the imagination of the software developers at Game Freak who get these ideas from their childhood experiences, including from reading Manga, the name for Japanese comic books. Ideas come from scary experiences they had <b>as</b> <b>kids,</b> catching insects, and so forth. So from these experiences in childhood, these ideas for Pokemon came out". In the same vein as the Pokémon Mew of the Red and Blue versions, the exclusive Pokémon Celebi was implemented in the Gold and Silver games but is only accessible after attending a Nintendo promotional event. The first official event offering Celebi was Nintendo Space World 2000 in Japan, in which 100,000 attendees would be awarded the rare Pokémon. In order to be selected, players had to send in a postcard to enter a lottery for one of 100,000 certificates of Celebi, allowing them to enter the event and obtain it.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for the DVD Talk, Jason Bovberg praised the episode for its [...] "spooky wonderfulness", {{stating that the}} episode scared his daughter. Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said, [...] "A fun, 'scary' (for little kids) SpongeBob that adults will appreciate, 'Graveyard Shift' uses the old standby of the headless/handless/legless (take your pick) killer-seeking-revenge stories we all told <b>as</b> <b>kids,</b> and cleverly grafts it onto a 'SpongeBob at work' storyline." [...] Mavis added, [...] "I always enjoy it when Rodger Bumpass, the voice actor for Squidward, gets quiet and {{manipulative}} when he's shining SpongeBob on, and here's {{one of the best}} examples of that." [...] He praised Count Orlok's cameo, [...] "especially when they animate the vampire's face into a goofy, giddy smile." [...] Mike Jackson of DVD Verdict said the episode is one of his [...] "personal faves." [...] He also said [...] " [...] has everything that makes the show great: funny dialogue (the whole story of the Hash-Slinging Slasher is hilarious), clever sight gags (especially SpongeBob's regenerating limbs), and that aforementioned outta-nowhere ending that made me bust a gut." ...|$|E

500|$|In Utero was {{released}} on September 13, 1993, on vinyl record and cassette tape in the United Kingdom, and on September 14 on vinyl in the United States, with the American vinyl pressing limited to 25,000 copies. [...] Although the album was issued on compact disc in the U.K. on September 14, a full domestic release did not occur until September 21. [...] In Utero débuted at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 album chart, selling 180,000 copies in its first week of release. [...] Meanwhile, retail chain stores Wal-Mart and Kmart refused to sell the album. [...] According to The New York Times, Wal-Mart claimed it did not carry the album due to lack of consumer demand, while Kmart representatives explained that the album [...] "didn't fit within our merchandise mix". [...] In truth, both chains feared that customers would be offended by the artwork on the album's back cover. [...] DGC issued {{a new version of the}} album with reworked packaging to the stores in March 1994. [...] This version featured edited album artwork, listed the name of [...] "Rape Me" [...] as [...] "Waif Me", and included a Scott Litt remix of [...] "Pennyroyal Tea". [...] A spokesperson for Nirvana explained that the band decided to edit the packaging because <b>as</b> <b>kids</b> Cobain and Novoselic were only able to buy music from the two chain stores; as a result they [...] "really want to make their music available to kids who don't have the opportunity to go to mom-and-pop stores".|$|E
500|$|Lisa visits Smithers, {{owner of}} the world's largest Malibu Stacy collection, and asks for help in finding Lovell, who was ousted from the Malibu Stacy company in 1974. Lisa bikes to Lovell's house and plays one of the doll's phrases over the intercom. The gate {{immediately}} opens. Lisa and Lovell decide {{to create a new}} talking doll, Lisa Lionheart, voiced by Lisa herself. The doll is quietly released, but the executives of Malibu Stacy have a meeting in which they agree that Lisa's doll is a real threat because it might hurt the sales of their doll. Meanwhile, Grampa struggles with his new job at Krusty Burger, suffering a war flashback at the drive-in and losing his false teeth making burgers. He soon becomes angry at the way seniors are treated, and quits. After a slow initial release, Lisa Lionheart suddenly gains popularity among the fans of Malibu Stacy after being featured in Kent Brockman's news show. At the mall, <b>as</b> <b>kids,</b> and Smithers, rush out to buy Lisa Lionheart, a cart of Malibu Stacy dolls with new hats is wheeled right into the path of the group running for the Lionheart display. Lisa appeals to them that it is just the same doll with a [...] "stupid, cheap" [...] hat, but they all prefer to stick with Malibu Stacy, largely due to the encouragement of Smithers, except for one little girl, who leaves with a Lisa Lionheart doll. Despite the fact that the doll is a failure, Lisa takes heart that her message was able to get through to at least one little girl.|$|E

2500|$|About the performance-capture process Singer stated, [...] "It's fascinating... It {{takes you}} back to play-acting as a kid {{in your living room}} because you are running around and having to imagine that you are in Gantua and imagine that there are these weapons and all these giant things. But there's nothing when you are there other than {{styrofoam}} and blocks. It forces the actors to regress to when they would play-act <b>as</b> <b>kids</b> or do minimalist theatre. But in that way it's fascinating - I can see why Robert Zemeckis and James Cameron have started to shoot pictures this way".|$|E

2500|$|The region's {{most popular}} park, Finlay Park has hosted just about {{everything}} from festivals and political rallies to road races and Easter Sunrise services. This [...] park has had two lives; first dedicated in 1859 as Sidney Park, {{named in honor of}} Algernon Sidney Johnson, a Columbia City Councilman, the park experienced an illustrious but short tenure.
