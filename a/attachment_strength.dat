5000|$|Both hairy {{and smooth}} pads in {{arthropods}} act {{to maximize the}} amount of contact with a surface. The foot pads of flies are densely covered with flexible hair-like structures called setae, and some lizards and spiders use similar hairy pads to create adhesive effects. This indicates a favourable design for hairy pad adhesion. [...] Hairy pads can be classified as pulvillus, fossula spongiosa, and tenent hairs. Hairy attachment pads employed few other features, such as flaw tolerance, lower sensitivity to contamination and roughness. Hairy attachment systems are typical for evolutionary younger and successful insect groups, such as Coleoptera and Diptera. The density of hairs increases with increasing body weight. An increase of the <b>attachment</b> <b>strength</b> in hairy systems is realized by {{increasing the number of}} single contact points. [...] Protuberances on the hairy pads of Coleoptera, Dermaptera and Diptera belong to different types. Representatives of the first two lineages have socketed setae on their pads. [...] Setae can range in length from a few micrometers to several millimeters. [...] Dipteran outgrowths are acanthae which are single sclerotized protuberances originating from a single cell. The acanthae are hollow inside and some have pores under the terminal plate, which presumably deliver an adhesive secretion directly to the contact area. Hairy attachment pads of reduviid bugs, flies [...] and beetles [...] secrete fluid into the contact area. The secretion contains non-volatile, lipid-like substances, but in some species it is two-phasic emulsion presumably containing water-soluble and lipid-soluble fractions. [...] Adhesion strongly decreases as the volume of the secretion decreases, which indicates that a layer of pad secretion that covers the terminal plates is crucial for generating a strong attractive force. Data suggests that besides van der Waals and Coulomb forces flies rely on attractive capillary forces mediated by the pad secretion. At low humidity, adhesion strongly depends on the amount of liquid deposited on the surface, and therefore contact duration.|$|E

CAFCA is based on two centrifugation steps: one to allow for the synchronization of the initial cell-substratum contact and one to enable both a defined removal force to be exerted onto the cells for displacement of unbound cells and determination of the relative binding strengths of adhering cells. The fluorescently tagged cells are monitored in specifically devised, disposable microplate assemblies by a two side fluorescence detection through the computer-interfaced SpectraFluor microplate fluorometer. The assay is rapid, accurate, reproducible and adaptable to small numbers of delicate primary cells that can ideally be labelled with the fluorochrome Calcein AM (or analogous vital fluorescent dyes) Most uniquely, CAFCA provides (i) means of assessing the precise number of cells bound to a given substratum out of the total amount of cells contained within the population to be analyzed and (ii) a means of establishing the <b>attachment</b> <b>strengths</b> (ie dynes/cell) in a high number of samples/conditions simultaneously.

Mechanical properties and biocompatibility make zirconia a suitable material for dental implants, although surface processings are still problematic. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare osteoblast behavior on structured zirconia and titanium surfaces under standardized conditions. Methods The surface characteristics were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In primary bovine osteoblasts attachment kinetics, proliferation rate and synthesis of bone-associated proteins were tested on different surfaces. Results The results demonstrated that the proliferation rate of cells was significantly higher on zirconia surfaces than on titanium surfaces (p t -test). In contrast, <b>attachment</b> and adhesion <b>strength</b> of the primary cells was significant higher on titanium surfaces (p U test). No significant differences were found in the synthesis of bone-specific proteins.

Zirconia improves cell proliferation significantly during the first days of culture, but it does not improve <b>attachment</b> and adhesion <b>strength.</b> Both materials do not differ with respect to protein synthesis or ultrastructural appearance of osteoblasts.

Evidence of adhesiveness/slime production was indicated by presence of a visible stained film lining the surface of the contact lens which was measured and recorded as strong or weak according to the density of the adhered bacterial film. Fourteen (28. 0 %) Staphylococcus aureus strains and 10 (20. 0 %) Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were obtained among other organisms. Staphylococcus aureus strains adhered in decreasing order to lotrafilcon B (55. 4 ± 4. 7), polymacon (46. 4 ± 8. 4), methfilcon A (46. 4 ± 8. 4) and omafilcon A (25. 0 ± 6. 4) with no significant difference in adhesive strengths of individual strains (P > 0. 05). Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains also recorded decreasing adhesive strengths to lotrafilcon B (37. 5 ± 8. 2), polymacon (28. 6 ± 6. 3), methafilcon A (26. 8 ± 5. 5) and omafilcon A (23. 2 ± 5. 5) also with no significant difference in adhesive strengths of individual strains (P > 0. 05). <b>Attachment</b> <b>strengths</b> of Staph. aureus strains to all four contact lenses were higher than those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 - 12 Global {{climate change}} {{by way of}} warming ocean {{temperatures}} and ocean acidification threatens the survival of marine organisms. For mussels, survival is tightly tied to byssal threads they form that anchor them to substrates, from the rocky intertidal to mussel aquaculture lines. Weakened byssal threads {{increase the likelihood of}} “fall-off” or “sloughing” from rocks and aquaculture lines, disturbing intertidal communities and reducing aquaculture yields. Seasonal variation in mussel <b>attachment</b> <b>strength</b> suggests environmental conditions may alter byssal thread strength and production. In this dissertation, I explore the role of rising temperature and ocean acidification on the mechanical performance of mussel byssal threads to improve predictions of what environmental conditions may precede fall-off events. In Chapter 1, I expose mussels (Mytilus trossulus) to a range of pH (7. 3 – 8. 2, total scale) and temperature conditions (10 – 25 ˚C) in a full factorial cross. Elevated temperature dramatically weakens mussel attachment: mussels produce 60 % weaker and 65 % fewer threads at 25 ˚C in comparison to 10 ˚C. The effects of temperature are strongest in the proximal region of the threads. Low pH (7. 3) strengthens the plaque region of the thread by 20 %, but has no effect on overall byssal thread strength. Since a thread is only as strong as its weakest region, these stressors do not act synergistically with each other; the strongest negative effect dominates, in this case temperature. Chapter 2 expands on the impacts of temperature on <b>attachment</b> <b>strength,</b> finding species-specific temperature effects. In the northeast Pacific, the warm-adapted mussel M. galloprovincialis and cold-adapted mussel M. trossulus compete for space on shore. While the <b>attachment</b> <b>strength</b> of these two closely related species does not differ from 11 - 18 ˚C, at temperatures from 18 - 24. 5 ˚C, M. trossulus <b>attachment</b> <b>strength</b> decreases while M. galloprovincialis <b>attachment</b> <b>strength</b> increases. At temperatures greater than 18 ˚C M. trossulus produces fewer and weaker byssal threads with attachments that were up to 93 % weaker than M. galloprovincialis. Chapter 3 follows up these laboratory studies using the field setting of a mussel farm to examine correlations between ocean conditions and <b>attachment</b> <b>strength</b> in M. trossulus. In the field, weak <b>attachment</b> <b>strength</b> in M. trossulus is best predicted by high temperature > 14 ˚C and low pH, M. galloprovincialis in more northern latitudes at the expense of native M. trossulus populations. Monitoring these conditions near farms can signal periods where attachment is expected to be weak in order to best adapt farming practices...|$|E

We quantified the effects of artificial epibiont fouling on the production of byssal threads, <b>attachment</b> <b>strength,</b> and movement in two size classes of blue mussels. In a factorial experiment, large epibiont-covered mussels produced more functional byssal threads (i. e., those continuous from animal to substrate) after 24 h than large unfouled and small fouled mussels, {{but not more than}} small unfouled mussels. Small unfouled mussels formed and released more byssus bundles compared to any other treatment group, which indicates increased movement. Conversely, epibiont fouling resulted in decreased numbers of byssus bundles shed, and therefore reduced movement in small mussels. Epibiont-covered mussels started producing byssal threads sooner than unfouled mussels, while small mussels began producing byssal threads earlier compared to large mussels. Mean <b>attachment</b> <b>strength</b> from both size classes increased by 9. 5 % when mussels were artificially fouled, and large mussels had a 34 % stronger attachment compared to small mussels. On the other hand, a 2. 3 % decrease in <b>attachment</b> <b>strength</b> was found with increasing byssus bundles shed. Our results suggest that fouling by artificial epibionts influences byssal thread production and <b>attachment</b> <b>strength</b> in large mussels, whereas epibionts on small mussels impact their ability to move.

40|$|The {{influence}} of lateral ligand mobility on cell attachment and receptor clustering {{has previously been}} explored for membrane-anchored molecules involved in cell-cell adhesion. In this study, we considered instead a cell binding motif from the extracellular matrix. Even though the lateral mobility of extracellular matrix ligands in membranes does not occur in vivo, {{we believe it is}} of interest for cell engineering in vitro. As is the case for cell-cell adhesion molecules, lateral mobility of extracellular matrix ligands could influence cell attachment and, subsequently, cell behavior in cell culture. In this paper, the accessibility and functionality of extracellular matrix ligands presented at surfaces were evaluated for the conditions of laterally mobile versus non-mobile ligands by studying ligand-antibody binding events and early cell attachment as a function of ligand concentration. We compare the initial attachment of rat-derived adult hippocampal progenitor (AHP) cells on laterally mobile, supported phospholipid bilayer membranes to non-mobile, poly-L-lysine-grafted-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLL-g-PEG) polymer films functionalized with a range of laminin-derived IKVAV-containing peptide densities. To this end, synthesis of a new PLL-g-PEG/PEG-IKVAV polymer is described. The characterization of available IKVAV peptides on both surface presentations schemes was explored by studying the mass uptake of anti-IKVAV antibodies using a combination of the surface-sensitive techniques quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, and optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy. IKVAV-containing peptides presented on laterally mobile, supported phospholipid bilayers and non-mobile PLL-g-PEG were recognized by the anti-IKVAV antibody in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the amount of available IKVAV ligands increases proportionally with ligand density over the concentrations tested. Attachment of AHP cells to IKVAV-functionalized PLL-g-PEG and supported phospholipid bilayers followed a sigmoidal dependence on peptide concentration, with a critical concentration of approximately 3 pmol/cm 2 IKVAV ligands required to support initial AHP cell attachment for both surface modifications. There appeared to be little {{influence of}} IKVAV peptide mobility on the initial attachment of AHP cells. Although the spread in the cell attachment data was larger for the PLL-g-PEG surface modification, this was reduced when observed after 24 h, indicating that the cells might need longer times to establish <b>attachment</b> <b>strengths</b> equivalent to those observed on peptide-functionalized supported lipid bilayers.

The second looks at definitions of online community as well as {{the ways in which the}} term has been used across a wide range of contexts, covering issues of <b>attachment,</b> emotion, community <b>strength,</b> motivation for participation, and relationship to technology. The third provides a general definition of online community around six key elements: commitment; connection to others; reciprocity; interaction; agency and consequences. The paper sensitises practitioners and researchers to the contested nature of community and provides a definition that is both broad and complex...|$|R
40|$|Hormosira banksii is a {{dominant}} intertidal alga characterised by limited dispersal of propagules, {{yet it has}} a broad distribution throughout temperate Australasia. However, the high abundance of beach wrack of H. banksii on sandy beaches along southwest Victoria, the frequency of frond dislodgment and the force required to break it from the substratum remain unknown. Dislodgment of macroalgae {{has been shown to}} influence dispersal processes; therefore, we tested the model that long-distance dispersal of H. banksii is facilitated by weak attachment to the substratum and frequent dislodgment of fertile fronds. We monitored the dislodgment of H. banksii individuals and conducted in situ pull tests to determine the <b>attachment</b> <b>strength</b> of fronds of H. banksii. We further tested whether thallus size or pull direction influenced <b>attachment</b> <b>strength</b> of H. banksii. We found that breakage of vesicles and fronds was a regular event during the survey period and that the mean <b>attachment</b> <b>strength</b> of fronds of H. banksii was weak compared to other intertidal algae. Furthermore, we found that thallus size did not influence the force required to break fronds of H. banksii from the substratum but that the direction that fronds were pulled from the substratum did. We suggest that fronds of H. banksii do drift frequently and that long-distance dispersal is likely to be an important mechanism for the distributional success of this species...|$|E
40|$|Equal {{distribution}} of load among fibrils {{in contact with}} a substrate is an important characteristic of fibrillar structures used by many small animals and insects for contact and adhesion. This is in contrast with continuum systems where stress concentration dominates interfacial failure. In this work, we study how adhesion strength of a fibrillar system depends on substrate roughness and variability of the fibril structure, which are modelled using probability distributions for fibril length and fibril <b>attachment</b> <b>strength.</b> Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to determine the adhesion strength statistics where fibril length follows normal or uniform distribution and <b>attachment</b> <b>strength</b> has a power-law form. Our {{results indicate that the}} strength distribution is Gaussian (normal) for both the uniform and the normal distributions for length. However, the fibrillar structure having normally distributed lengths has higher strength and lower toughness than one having uniformly distributed lengths. Our simulations also show that an increase in the compliance of the fibrils can compensate for both the substrate roughness and the <b>attachment</b> <b>strength</b> variation. We also show that, as the number of fibrils n increases, the load-carrying efficiency of each fibril goes down. For large n, this effect is found to be small. Furthermore, this effect is compensated {{by the fact that the}} standard deviation of the adhesive strength decreases as 1 /n...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{studied the}} <b>attachment</b> <b>strength</b> of Dreissena polymorpha on nine {{artificial}} substrata in the labora-tory. The highest <b>attachment</b> <b>strength</b> (0. 46 N) {{was found on}} resocart (phenoplast plastic). It was lower on alu-minium, acrylic, PVC, rubber and glass (listed {{in the order of}} decreasing strength), and the lowest on zinc, Penaten cream coating and copper. Apart from reducing adhesion, copper substratum caused also heavy mor-tality of the mussels. Further experiments, in which mussels were exposed on resocart surfaces {{in the presence of the}} examined materials (thus being influenced only by waterborne substances released by them), revealed that zinc and copper inhibited mussel attachment primarily by means of ions released to the water column. In the case of Penaten coating, the impact of its surface properties upon mussels seemed to be more important than waterborne cues...|$|E
40|$|The {{current work}} {{deals with the}} studies of {{isolation}} and characterization of oral biofilm forming bacteria. The major constituent of biofilm other than bacterial cells is the Extracellular Polymeric Slime matrix (EPS) which is secreted by the bacterial cells themselves. Physical properties of biofilms like <b>attachment,</b> mechanical <b>strength,</b> antibiotic resistance {{can be attributed to}} EPS matrix. In this study, attempts were made to study the stress response of bacteria isolated and their chemotactic response. Further attempts were made to characterize the EPS matrix by chemical as well as spectroscopic studies. The bacterial strains isolated were characterized to be Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Bacillus subtilis by biochemical identification method. SEM micrographs taken confirmed the formation of biofilm. It was observed that cell attachment was maximum when glucose was used as the sole carbon source. Test for biofilm formation in presence of metal salts of Iron and Zinc showed moderate to high inhibition of film formation. The chemotaxis studies carried out in present work indicates the poor response of two strains towards fructose and sucrose. The EPS characterization result indicated the presence of a macromolecular complex constituting of carbohydrate, protein, lipids and nucleic acids...|$|R
40|$|Kelps often {{live in a}} harsh {{hydrodynamic}} {{environment where}} wave-driven dislodgement of individuals can alter the biodiversity and functioning of reef systems, and increase production in coastal ecosystems adjacent to reefs. The current paradigm is that winter storms tear kelps from reefs once hydrodynamic forces exceed <b>attachment</b> or tissue <b>strength</b> - a threshold response that implies a pulsed relationship between wave forces and dislodgement. Here, we challenge this understanding by showing how kelp phenology can decouple susceptibility to dislodgement from seasonal patterns in wave forces. We measured kelp dislodgement rates and hydrodynamic forces at nine subtidal reefs over two years (n = 4320 kelps tagged and monitored). Contrary to expectation, we found relatively low and constant dislodgement rates for all reefs (13...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} residents' trust in government and their emotions toward an event on their perceptions of potential impacts and their support. This study also examines the moderating role of event <b>attachment</b> on the <b>strength</b> of relationships between residents' trust in government and their impacts perceptions, emotional responses, and {{as well as their}} support based on social exchange theory and cognitive appraisal theory. Findings clearly indicate that residents' support is a function of both cognitive and affective assessment of perceived impacts. Trust in government influences directly residents' support and indirectly through perceived impacts and experienced emotions toward an event. Findings further suggest that level of event attachment moderates the effects of trust on residents’ perceptions of impacts, their emotions, as well as on their support...|$|R
