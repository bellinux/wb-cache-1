40|$|Large area {{growth of}} high quality {{graphene}} remains a challenge, and is currently dominated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on metal catalyst films. This method requires a transfer of the graphene onto an insulating substrate for electronic applications, and the graphene film quality and performance can vary with the transfer. A more attractive approach is plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of graphene and nanocrystalline graphene (NCG) directly on insulating substrates. The aim of this project was to explore the deposition process and microfabrication processes based on these NCG films. A deposition process for nanocrystalline graphene was developed in this work based on parallel-plate PECVD. NCG with thicknesses between 3 and 35 nm were deposited directly on wet thermal oxidized silicon wafers with diameter of 150 mm, quartz glass and sapphire glass. High NCG thickness uniformities of 87 % over full wafer were achieved. Surface roughness was measured by atomic force microscopy and shows root mean square (RMS) values of less than 0. 23 nm for 3 nm thin films. NCG films deposited on quartz and sapphire show promising performance as transparent conductor with 13 kΩ/X sheet resistance at 85 % transparency. Furthermore, the suitability of the developed PECVD NCG films for microfabrication was demonstrated. Microfabrication process development was focused on four device types. NCG membranes were fabricated based on through-wafer inductively coupled plasma etching from the back, and consecutive membrane release by HF vapor etching. The fabrication of suspended NCG strips, based on HF vapor release, shows promising results, but was not entirely successful due to insufficient thickness of the sacrificial oxide. Top gated NCG strips are successfully fabricated, and the increased modulation by the top gate is demonstrated. Finally, NCG nanowire fabrication is performed on 150 mm wafers. Experiments yielded an increased back gate modulation effect by a reduced NCG thickness, although no nanowire formation was observed. A highly accurate focused ion beam (FIB) prototyping technique was developed and applied to exfoliated graphene in this work. This technique systematically avoids any exposure of the graphene to Ga+-ions {{through the use of}} an <b>alignment</b> <b>marker</b> system, achieving alignment accuracies better than 250 nm. Contacts were deposited by FIB- or e-beam-assisted tungsten deposition, and FIB trench milling was used to confine conduction to a narrow channel.

40|$|Alignment between {{lithography}} layers {{is essential}} for device fabrication.

In this paper we show that this can be prevented by using extra <b>alignment</b> <b>markers</b> to check the alignment during patterning, rather than inspecting vernier patterns after the exposure is completed. Accurate vernier patterns can often only be read after pattern transfer has been carried out. We also show that by using a Penrose tile as a marker it is possible to locate the marker to about 1 nm without fully exposing the resist. This means that the marker can be reused with full accuracy, thus improving the layer to layer alignment accuracy. Lithography tool noise limits the process...|$|R

It allows ISO 10110 characterization with the conic section parameters of surfaces that are rotated and translated as it is common in the data output from measurement devices and <b>alignment</b> <b>markers</b> on lens are not needed. The additional criterion for residuals can effectively remove unuseful data to keep results for the main part of aperture unaffected by local imperfections. Moreover, the part of algorithm that finds the correct coordinate system and removes outliers can be used independently on the conic section fitting part. Thus the algorithm will be useful for the optical community for precise characterisation and testing of aspheric lens.|$|R

Materials and Methods: Prostate alignments using the BAT system were compared with alignments using radiographic images of implanted radiopaque <b>markers.</b> The latter <b>alignments</b> were used as a reference. The difference between the BAT and <b>marker</b> <b>alignments</b> represents the displacements that would remain if the alignments were done using ultrasonography. The inter-user variability of the contour alignment process was assessed. Results: On the basis of the <b>marker</b> <b>alignments,</b> the initial displacement of the prostate in the AP, superoinferior, and lateral direction was 0. 9 3. 9, 0. 1 3. 9, and 0. 2 3. 4 mm respectively. The directed differences between the BAT and <b>marker</b> <b>alignments</b> in the respective directions were 0. 2 3. 7, 2. 7 3. 9, and 1. 6 3. 1 mm.

40|$|Substrate {{conformal}} {{imprint lithography}} (SCIL) is an innovative soft lithography method {{for the transfer}} of large area nanostructures. This technology was originally invented by Philips Research. With {{the implementation of the}} SCIL process on mask aligners, the standard alignment options of a mask aligner were also available for SCIL. This work presents studies on overlay alignment accuracy of the SCIL process on mask aligners. The utilized <b>alignment</b> <b>markers</b> were common box-in-box fiducials. With these structures, the alignment accuracy was determined. The experiments showed that the SCIL process induces a shift of the stamp with respect to the stage in imprint direction during the initial movement of the stamp from the SCIL actuator to the substrate. This shift is reproducible and depends on the distance between the actuator and the substrate. With an offset correction of the stage, this shift could be compensated. The achieved alignment accuracy was then below one micrometer, limited just by the mechanical capabilities of the mask aligner. Besides, global and local distortions of the imprinted structures with respect to the original master structures were identified and analyzed within this work. It was found that there is no systematic distortion of structures in the stamp due to the imprint process itself despite using the flexible composite SCIL stamps with polydimethylsiloxane pattern layer. Only nonsystematic local distortions could be found. Finally, the accuracy of the stamp manufacturing process for the SCIL stamps was investigated, and it was found that large distances in the centimeter range between single features are reproduced with a variation of 0. 06 ‰. All together, the results of this work show that an accurate and reproducible overlay alignment of imprinted lithography layers is possible using SCIL as a wafer scale imprint technology...|$|R
