40|$|Very high erucic <b>acid</b> <b>oils</b> have {{potential}} industrial uses and many different techniques are being studied to develop crops that could produce these oils. However, the physical properties of these potential oils {{have not been}} studied very thoroughly. This research was designed to first synthesize very high erucic <b>acid</b> <b>oils</b> and then to characterize their physical and chemical properties. A method was developed for the synthesis of trierucin by direct esterification of glycerol and erucic acid, {{without the use of}} a catalyst. The esterification reaction was conducted in a two-step heating process under 25 mm Hg vacuum. The two-step heating process included heating glycerol and erucic acid at 160 Â± 5 Â°C for 4 hr followed by heating at 250 Â± 10 Â°C for 8 hr. Purification of the esterified product was achieved by alkali refining followed by passing through an alumina column. Greater than 85 % yield of pure triacylglycerols, containing ~ 90 % erucic acid, was obtained through chemical synthesis by using a 5 % molar excess of erucic acid in the reaction. The use of an initial low temperature (160 Â± 5 Â°C) of reaction resulted in a light colored product with optimum yield of trierucin. Erucic <b>acid</b> <b>oils</b> containing 45 to 91 % erucic acid content were prepared by interesterifying native HEAR oil and synthetic oil product. Chemical and physical properties of all these synthetic oils were then examined. Melting point, cloud point, pour point, titer, viscosity and heat capacity of all synthetic oils exhibited positive correlations with the erucic acid content, whereas saponification value, iodine value and refractive index showed negative correlations. Randomization of HEAR oil resulted in an increase in the melting point, cloud point and pour point. Very high erucic <b>acid</b> <b>oils,</b> having a low degree of unsaturation, will be able to withstand oxidation, and will remain stable during high temperature processing conditions. The increased viscosity of very high erucic <b>acid</b> <b>oils</b> will also add to the lubrication capability of these oils. The use of very high erucic <b>acid</b> <b>oils</b> would be limited by their melting point as they would be solid at room temperature. These synthetic oils could find use in lubrication and in high temperature applications and work to produce these oils through selective breeding of plants, or through chemical synthesis should continue...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBiodiesel has the {{potential}} to become a suitable substitute for diesel fuel in the future.

In addition to maintaining seed purity during field production, it was also necessary to develop "in plant" procedures for oil extraction and refining. Special techniques were devised for grading the seed with respect to erucic acid levels and green seed content. Collaborative studies with several domestic oil processors were carried through to final product evaluation but market development work with consumers was not initiated. The adverse nutritional data on high erucic <b>acid</b> <b>oils</b> which {{was presented at the}} International Conference at St. Adele in 1970 indicated the need for an immediate reduction of erucic acid levels in food products. The availability of low erucic acid seed in commercial quantities, and the processing and utilization experiences with the seed and oil, permitted an immediate and complete switch-over to low erucic acid varieties in Canada. This gave Canadian plant breeders a lead time of several years over those in other countries to develop high yielding and more adapted varieties of this new genotype. Canada became the first country to offer low erucic acid seed and oil in world markets.

Oleic acid and high acid acid oil (HAAO) were esterified by reaction with methanol in the presence of Amberlyst- 15 as a heterogeneous catalyst or sulfuric acid as a homogeneous catalyst. The yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was studied at oil to methanol molar ratios of 1 : 3 and 1 : 6 and reaction temperatures of 60 and 80 degrees C. The rate of esterification of oleic acid significantly decreased as the initial water content increased to 20 % of the oil. The activity of Amberlyst- 15 decreased more rapidly than that of sulfuric acid, due to the direct poisoning of acid sites by water. Esterification using sulfuric acid was not affected by water until there was a 5 % water addition at a 1 : 6 molar ratio of oil to methanol. FAME content of HAAO prepared from soapstock rapidly increased for the first 30 min of esterification. Following the 30 -min mark, the rate of FAME production decreased significantly due to the accumulation of water. When methanol and Amberlyst- 15 were removed from the HAAO after 30 min of esterification and fresh methanol and a catalyst were added, the time required to reach 85 % FAME content was reduced from 6 h to 1. 8 h.

In the present study we evaluated the influence of the unsaponifiable fraction of VOO on the production of eicosanoids and nitric oxide (NO) by endothelial cells (HUVECs). Triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRLs) were isolated from human serum after the intake of meals enriched in 3 high-oleic <b>acid</b> <b>oils,</b> i. e., high-oleic sunflower (HOSO), VOO, or enriched-virgin olive (EVO) oils, the last-mentioned containing 2. 4 % of unsaponifiable matter. HOSO induced a greater accumulation of triglycerides (TGs) in the postprandial serum than VOO or EVO, as measured by calculating the area under the curve. The incubation with TRLs increased NO release by endothelial cells compared with untreated control cells, but the effects of the various TRLs did not differ. EVO-derived TRLs reduced the production of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and thromboxane B 2 (TxB 2) (the stable metabolite of TxA 2) compared with VOO- or HOSO-derived TRLs. The release of PGI 2 (as 6 -keto PGF 1 α) was similarly diminished by all TRLs compared with the control. In conclusion, the unsaponifiable fraction of VOO does not affect postprandial triglyceridemia, but it has favorable effects on endothelial function, mainly by reducing proinflammatory and vasoconstrictor eicosanoid synthesis (PGE 2 and TxB 2).

Seventy-two 1 -day-old female broiler chicks were randomly distrib-uted into 18 cages. The three treatments used were the result of a basal diet supplemented with 6 wt % of native palm oil (N-TAG), re-esterified palm oil (E-TAG), or re-esterified palm oil high in mono- and diacylglycerols (E-MDAG). Chemical esterification raised the fraction of palmitic acid at the sn- 2 position from 9. 63 mol % in N-TAG oil to 17. 9 mol % in E-TAG oil. Furthermore, E-MDAG oil pre-sented a high proportion of mono- (23. 1 wt%) and diacyl-glycerols (51. 2 wt%), with FA mainly located at the sn- 1, 3 positions, which resulted in a lower gross-energy content and an increased solid-fat index at the chicken’s body tempera-ture. However, re-esterified palm oils did not alter fat absorption, postprandial lipemia, or growth performance, compared to native palm oil, so they can be used as alter-native fat sources in broiler chick diets...|$|E

40|$|The first {{commercial}} quantities of a soybean oil with about three percent linolenic <b>acid</b> <b>oil</b> were produced in Iowa in 1994 through a collaboration with Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. Continued to breed new soybean varieties {{with a focus}} on a even lower linolenic acid content of one percent. I was interested in understanding whether the oil would be stable enough to eliminate the need for chemical hydrogenation. During the process of increasing one percent linolenic acid seed varieties to obtain oil for testing, the Food and Drug Administration announced it would require labeling for trans fat beginning in 2006. Instead of using the seed of the new varieties to obtain oil for testing, it was used for further seed production so that commercial quantities of the one percent linolenic <b>acid</b> <b>oil</b> could be available as quickly as possible...|$|R
40|$|Background-—Avocados are a nutrient-dense {{source of}} {{monounsaturated}} fatty acids (MUFA) {{that can be}} used to replace saturated fatty acids (SFA) in a diet to lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Well-controlled studies are lacking on the effect of avocado consumption on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Methods and Results-—A randomized, crossover, controlled feeding trial was conducted with 45 overweight or obese participants with baseline LDL-C in the 25 th to 90 th percentile. Three cholesterol-lowering diets (6 % to 7 % SFA) were fed (5 weeks each) : a lower-fat diet (LF: 24 % fat); 2 moderate-fat diets (34 % fat) provided similar foods and were matched for macronutrients and fatty acids: the avocado diet (AV) included one fresh Hass avocado (136 g) per day, and the moderate-fat diet (MF) mainly used high oleic <b>acid</b> <b>oils</b> to match the fatty acid content of one avocado. Compared with baseline, the reduction in LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol on the AV diet (13. 5 mg/dL, 14. 6 mg/dL) was greater (P< 0. 05) than the MF (8. 3 mg/ dL, 8. 7 mg/dL) and LF (7. 4 mg/dL, 4. 8 mg/dL) diets. Furthermore, only the AV diet significantly decreased LDL particle number (LDL-P, 80. 1 nmol/L, P= 0. 0001), small dense LDL cholesterol (LDL 3 + 4, 4. 1 mg/dL, P= 0. 04), and the ratio of LDL/HDL (6. 6 %, P< 0. 0001) from baseline. Conclusions-—Inclusion of one avocado per day as part of a moderate-fat, cholesterol-lowering diet has additional LDL-C, LDL-P, and non-HDL-C lowering effects, especially for small, dense LDL. Our results demonstrate that avocados have beneficial effects on cardio-metabolic risk factors that extend beyond their heart-healthy fatty acid profile...|$|E
40|$|Shipping of {{edible fats}} and oils into Europe is {{permitted}} in bulk tanks, in which substances, included in a positive list, had been previously transported. The European Commission requested EFSA to evaluate the list of substances in the Annex to Commission Directive 96 / 3 /EC as acceptable previous cargoes for edible {{fats and oils}}, taking into account its review of the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) criteria for acceptable previous cargoes and criteria proposed by the Codex Committee for Fats and Oils. This is the second of three scientific opinions by the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel), in which thirty-five of these substances or groups of substances have been evaluated. The CONTAM Panel concluded that fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty alcohol blends, fatty acid methyl esters, fatty acid esters, and animal, marine and vegetable and hydrogenated oils and fats, all as specified, and <b>acid</b> <b>oils</b> and fatty acid distillates, acetic acid, sulphuric acid, formic acid, acetic anhydride, acetone, n-heptane, n-hexane, cyclohexane, pentane, iso-propanol, propyl alcohol, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, n-propyl acetate, ammonium hydroxide, limonene, methyl tert-butyl ether, urea ammonia nitrate solution, calcium chloride solution, magnesium chloride solution, potable water, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, silicon dioxide, sorbitol, molasses and beeswax would not be of health concern as previous cargoes. However, because of its insolubility in water and high melting point, silicon dioxide is not suitable for transport in tankers for edible fats and oils. There was insufficient information available on the composition of wine lees for the CONTAM Panel to conclude {{that it would not}} be of health concern when used as a previous cargo. The CONTAM Panel made several recommendations regarding the way in which the substances are described in the Annex to Commission Directive 96 / 3 /EC, to correct inaccuracies and to better reflect current transport practices...|$|E
40|$|A {{breakthrough}} {{has been}} discovered in pathology chemistry related to increasing molecular structure that can interfere with oxygen diffusion through cell membranes. Free radicals can crosslink unsaturated low-viscosity fatty <b>acid</b> <b>oils</b> by chain-growth polymerization into more viscous liquids and even solids. Free radicals are released by mitochondria in response to intermittent hypoxia that can increase membrane molecular organization to reduce fluidity and oxygen diffusion in a possible continuing vicious cycle toward pathological disease. Alternate computational chemistry demonstrates molecular bond dynamics in free energy for cell membrane physiologic movements. Paired electrons in oxygen and nitrogen atoms require that oxygen bonds rotate and nitrogen bonds invert to seek polar nano-environments and hide from nonpolar nano-environments thus creating fluctuating instability at a nonpolar membrane and polar biologic fluid interface. Subsequent mechanomolecular movements provide free energy to increase diffusion by membrane transport of molecules and oxygen into the cell, cell-membrane signaling/recognition/defense in addition to protein movements for enzyme mixing. In other chemistry calcium bonds to membrane phosphates primarily on the outer plasma cell membrane surface to influence the membrane firing threshold for excitability and better seal out water permeation. Because calcium is an excellent metal conductor and membrane phosphate headgroups form a semiconductor at the biologic fluid interface, excess electrons released by mitochondria may have more broad dissipation potential by safe conduction through calcium atomic-sized circuits on the outer membrane surface. Regarding medical conditions, free radicals are known to produce pathology especially in age-related disease in addition to aging. Because cancer cell membranes develop extreme polymorphism that has been extensively followed in research, accentuated easily-visualized free-radical models are developed. In terms of treatment, use of vitamin nutrient supplements purported to be antioxidants that remove free radicals has not proved worthwhile in clinical trials presumably due to errors with early antioxidant measurements based on inaccurate colorimetry tests. However, newer covalent-bond shrinkage tests now provide accurate measurements for free-radical inhibitor hydroquinone and other molecules toward drug therapy...|$|E
