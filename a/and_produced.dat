40|$|A {{system for}} {{encoding}} and decoding data words including an anti-analysis encoder unit for receiving an original plaintext <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> a recoded data, a data compression unit for receiving the recoded data <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> a compressed recoded data, and an encryption unit for receiving the compressed recoded data <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> an encrypted data. The recoded data has an increased non-correlatable data redundancy {{compared with the}} original plaintext in order to mask the statistical distribution of characters in the plaintext data. The system of the present invention further includes a decryption unit for receiving the encrypted data <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> a decrypted data, a data decompression unit for receiving the decrypted data <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> an uncompressed recoded data, and an anti-analysis decoder unit for receiving the uncompressed recoded data <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> a recovered plaintext that corresponds with the original plaintext...|$|R
