2500|$|A new {{steelwork}} {{lower deck}} of contemporary design incorporating an amphitheatre feature {{was installed in}} the main hold while a glass-encased lift installed within the ship terminates in a new steel-and-glass housing structure on the weather deck. A second new steel-and-glass box has been installed above the forehold to enclose a new staircase. Access to the ship is through a new opening cut through the hull below the waterline in the ship's starboard quarter. The new <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> has required the addition of new steel framing. Visitors arriving on board the ship now do so via this entrance, {{which leads to the}} lower hold. Maldwin Drummond, Chairman of the Cutty Sark Trust, has explained in Classic Boat magazine's September 2010 issue the need to retain the spirit of the ship and he quotes the ideal that [...] "The visitor should see the ship as though for some unexplained reason the crew had gone ashore". Doubts over the wisdom of Grimshaw's proposals have been raised by many ship conservationists including the Cutty Sark Trust's own engineer Peter Mason.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantages}} {{of this system}} are in increased safety for the fire-fighter, as they may remain outside the most hazardous area. In particular, the need for highly-dangerous smoke diving is reduced. The small size of the <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> also reduces any risk of flashover or backdraft. Flashover is reduced by avoiding the need {{to open up a}} large <b>access</b> <b>hole,</b> backdraft by the flow of water through this small hole keeping any flow cooled and directed inwards, towards the fire.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Modular {{structural}} {{systems are}} constructed using a method that they are assembled with prefabricated unit modular frames on-site. This provides a benefit that can significantly reduce building construction time. The structural design is usually carried out {{under the assumption that}} their load-carrying mechanism {{is similar to that of}} traditional steel moment-resisting systems. However, both systems are different in terms of beam-column connection details which may strongly influence the lateral structural behavior. Specially, the presence of <b>access</b> <b>holes</b> in a beam-column joint of a unit modular frame could cause undesirable failure during strong earthquakes. Therefore, this study carried out finite element analyses (FEMs) of unit modular frames to investigate the cyclic behavior of beam-column joints with the <b>access</b> <b>holes.</b> Analysis results show that the unit modular frames present stable cyclic response with large deformation capacities and their joints are classified into semi-rigid connections even if there are <b>access</b> <b>holes.</b> Keywords—Unit modular frame, steel moment connection, nonlinear analytical model, moment-rotation relation, <b>access</b> <b>holes.</b> I...|$|R

The tank has a circular <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> with a drop-in lid and was possibly used for water storage, possibly runoff from the cottage roof.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, the mine's fuse {{mechanism}} {{was against}} the pillar, meaning that the mine had to be turned {{before it could be}} defused. Some of the water was pumped out and an <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> was cut {{into the side of the}} gas holder.

50|$|Kazans may be {{suspended}} over {{a fire in}} a variety of ways. Sometimes metal frames (a tripod called sajayaq) are made, or alternatively (especially for large kazan), a hole may be dug in the ground which will hold the kazan and provide enough space underneath to keep a fire under it—in this case, an <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> is built in the side to allow the fire to be tended, and to let in air. Smaller kazans may be used on gas stoves {{with the help of a}} specially designed piece of metal that lets the heat the flame transfer to the kazan while at the same time holding it upright and steady.|$|E
50|$|Variation 7 is not {{dissimilar}} to {{the so-called}} port-hole (bottom left), in which the front stone or, as in the diagram, two front stones are hewn out so as to create a circular <b>access</b> <b>hole.</b> The slabs were made of a material that enabled contemporary methods and tools {{to be used to}} fashion them. This version occurs Central Europe at sites built by the Wartberg and Horgen cultures in Baden-Württemberg and Switzerland. Some Swedish so-called megalithic stone cists also have port-holes. In German, such a hole is known as a Seelenloch ("soul hole"), a name that originated because of the erroneous assumption that holes were created with the intention of releasing the soul of the deceased (in the minds of the builders). In the Bronze and Iron Age sites on Sardinia and the Iberian Peninsula, similar openings are found, that are also narrow, but nearer the ground, and apse-like, (recess-shaped) with embedded closure stones.|$|E

5000|$|When workers {{began to}} cut the <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> for the steam generators, a crack formed. That crack was repaired, but more cracks appeared. Engineers noticed that parts of the {{concrete}} had delaminated. This was repaired, and the concrete re-tensioned, but the same problem was found in other areas. The plant had originally been due to restart in April 2011 following the uprate, but in June 2011 Progress Energy said {{that it did not}} expect it to restart until 2014. Preliminary cost estimates for the repairs was put at between $900 million and $1.3 billion, but this estimate was later called into question by Duke Energy. In October 2012 an independent review estimated the repair cost at $1.5 billion, with a worst-case scenario of $3.4 billion. In February 2013 Duke Energy announced that Crystal River would be permanently shut down and that they will recover $850 million in insurance claims.A Duke spokesperson stated, [...] "The company sought input from numerous engineering experts — internally and externally — and used proven industry-accepted practices when determining how to replace the steam generators. Analysis has shown that the 2009 delamination (cracking) could not have been predicted. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission confirmed these findings." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{passengers}} {{once again}} panic when a businessman threatens {{to pull the}} emergency door latch open as the train passes through Osaka; they are further exacerbated when they hear of Ōshiro's death on the radio. Meanwhile, police locate Koga, but fail to arrest him, despite wounding him during the chase. Koga limps back into Okita's hideout to have his gunshot wound tended. Okita ponders on giving up his mission, as he has failed to prevent any bloodshed, but Koga convinces him to carry on. As police trace the bomb parts to Okita's former company in Shimura, Okita makes another phone call and tells Miyashita to drop the money at an abandoned truck by the Kanda motorway in 10 minutes. After the police do as instructed, Okita takes the suitcase and makes his getaway. Back aboard the train, Kazuko loses her baby in a miscarriage and {{is in need of}} a blood transfusion. Okita then calls Miyashita and tells him to pick up a diagram of the bomb at Sun Plaza cafe in Shinbashi. Unfortunately, the cafe is destroyed in a fire by the time police arrive. When the police surround Okita's hideout, Koga blows himself up with a stick of dynamite rather than turn himself in. With no other options left, Kuramochi goes on television to make an appeal for Okita to help them disable the bomb. On the train, Shinji Fujio, a former accomplice of Okita being escorted after his arrest, reveals that Okita is on his way out of Japan using a false name. With the help of high-speed cameras, the Shinkansen authorities manage to locate the bomb underneath the second coach. Kuramochi relays the information to Aoki and sends a rescue train to provide welding equipment to cut an <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> where the bomb is. Aoki succeeds in defusing the bomb, but the authorities suspect a second bomb located elsewhere underneath the train. Despite this, the government gives the order to stop the train. Aoki manages to stop Hikari 109 without incident. As Kuramochi leaves the main control room to regain his composure, he discovers that his appeal is still being broadcast on TV. Miyashita explains that {{this is part of the}} police's trap for Okita. Overwhelmed by the pressure of the day's situation, Kuramochi resigns from his position.|$|E

Those with metal surface exposure were excluded from this study. Patients with edentulous arch or section, full or partial denture as antagonists {{were excluded from the}} study. During the evaluation period, 2 patients (male) dropped out from this study. One access-hole (AMB/ 22) with an atypical shape (non-circular) causing a noticeable overfilling of the M 4 M was excluded from this study. Finally, 12 patients with a total of 56 access-holes were examined (28 <b>access</b> <b>holes</b> for both groups, CR and M 4 M). For each patient, access-holes were randomly divided in right and left sides to get equivalent numbers for both materials. All the fillings (CR and M 4 M groups) were performed by a single operator.|$|R
40|$|A custom {{version of}} the TerminatorBot is {{described}} for corebored inspection during search-and-rescue operations. “Corebored inspection ” refers to visual inspection of a void by passing a small camera through an <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> into the void. This is the classic “camera-on-a-stick ” approach. Sometimes the <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> occurs naturally. Sometimes a suspected void has no <b>access</b> <b>hole.</b> To gain access, a hole is bored through the rubble with a coring tool, hence the term “core-bored inspection. ” In either case, the camera, once inside, can articulate to look around, but is limited to line-of-sight. Occlusions can prevent a thorough inspection or force using/boring another hole. A small, agile robotic device could augment {{the use of such}} cameras. We propose the TerminatorBot as as a prototype limbed robot for studying such applications...|$|E
