5|$|After 1966, in <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> past policies, the Ministry of Economy {{announced}} a programme to reduce rising inflation while promoting competition, efficiency, and foreign investment. The anti-inflation programme focussed on controlling nominal wages and salaries. Inflation decreased sharply, decreasing from {{an annual rate}} of about 30% in 1965–67 to 7.6% in 1969. Unemployment remained low, but real wages fell.|$|E
5|$|The {{executives}} of Columbia Records were {{not convinced that}} the album would sell well, because the project was <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> his earlier success in the outlaw movement. The album included pop, jazz and folk music styles, in addition to country. It was recorded from December 3–12, 1977.|$|E
5|$|As a final {{attempt to}} stop the Allied advances, the Japanese Imperial High Command planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū codenamed Operation Ketsugō. This was to be <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the defense in depth plans used in the invasions of Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Instead, {{everything}} was staked on the beachhead; more than 3,000 kamikazes {{would be sent to}} attack the amphibious transports before troops and cargo were disembarked on the beach.|$|E
50|$|The Fender HM Strat was an {{electric}} guitar produced by Fender Musical Instruments from 1988 until 1992. <b>A</b> relatively <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> Leo Fender's classic Stratocaster design, it was Fender's answer to Superstrats produced by manufacturers such as Jackson Guitars and Ibanez. HM stands for heavy metal.|$|R
5000|$|The {{character}} set also included the conventional symbols for multiplication and division, [...] and , but in <b>a</b> more <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the conventions established by FORTRAN, it allowed implicit multiplication, so the expressions [...] and [...] were valid, {{with the values}} 99 and 15.9, respectively (op cit).|$|R

5|$|The album {{features}} a heavy use of electronics augmented by orchestration, and takes {{inspiration from the}} apocalyptic artwork of schizophrenic artist Royal Robertson. Stevens' use of electronics marked <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> much of his previous work—most notably from Seven Swans and Michigan. Unlike Illinois, the lyrics do not explore events, characters or setting, but deal instead with themes and emotions on a personal level.|$|E
5|$|This {{major change}} from a Classical design to a far more complex revival style, little known in Russia, meant Vorontsov had to find an {{alternative}} architect to execute a new design. This was further complicated by Vorontsov's desire to not only have a loose Jacobean style, but also to incorporate motifs from Islamic architecture so as to highlight the oriental strain evident in the Khan's Palace, Enikale Fort, and other local Tatar architecture. The resulting design was to highlight the Crimea's position {{as a place where}} the East and West meet. It was <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the Neoclassical strain that dominated the Russian architecture of the period.|$|E
5|$|In December 1971, {{following}} {{the defeat of}} South Vietnamese forces during Operation Lam Son 719, North Vietnamese leadership in Hanoi decided to launch a major military offensive against South Vietnam. In {{what became known as}} the Easter Offensive, the combined North Vietnamese and Việt Cộng forces employed combined arms tactics using heavy weapons that were <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the low-intensity guerrilla warfare of previous years. Although North Vietnam eventually used the equivalent of 14 army divisions, its leaders did not seek to win the war outright. Rather, their objective was to gain as much territory and destroy as many units of the South Vietnamese military as possible, in order to strengthen their bargaining position at the Paris Peace Talks.|$|E
30|$|The reform also {{established}} {{that access to}} benefits is contingent to the individual’s willingness to be active {{in the labor market}} (i.e. by participating in re-training courses) or to accept a job offer, at given conditions. In case of refusal–and this is <b>a</b> rather <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the past–the benefit is cancelled. Of course, to be effective these ’stick and carrot” devices need very serious monitoring and implementation, which can be a problem in a country rather unfamiliar with active policies and to contingent benefits.|$|R
50|$|Stowe, in Buckinghamshire, (1730-1738), was <b>an</b> {{even more}} <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the formal French garden. In the early 18th century, Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham, had {{commissioned}} Charles Bridgeman {{to design a}} formal garden, with architectural decorations by John Vanbrugh. Bridgeman's design included an octagonal lake and a Rotunda (1720-21) designed by Vanbrugh.|$|R
5|$|Zelda II {{was rated}} the 110th best game {{made on a}} Nintendo System in Nintendo Powers Top 200 Games list. In August 2008, Nintendo Power listed it as the 12th best Nintendo Entertainment System video game, {{describing}} it as <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> and refreshing <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> its predecessor.|$|R
5|$|Following {{passage of}} the Catholic Relief Act, Charles Brownlow granted a site to the Roman Catholic parish priest the Reverend William O'Brien in 1829 for the {{construction}} of a church on Distillery Hill, now known as lower North Street. It was there that work began in 1832 on what is now St Peter's Church. In 1966, another Catholic church, St Paul's, was built at the junction of Francis Street and Parkview Street. This was <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> traditional church architecture with its grey plaster finish, copper roof, slim spire, hexagonal angles and modern design throughout. Many of its architectural features such as the copper roof and gray plaster finish are shared by the neighbouring St Paul's School. It was designed to cope with the extra demand for worship space following the growth of the surrounding Taghnevan and Shankill housing estates.|$|E
5|$|The {{assemblage}} of monumental Neolithic structures in Orkney is without parallel in the United Kingdom {{and on the}} Orkney Mainland provides an entire landscape of features from this period. During this time, complex new societies {{came to the fore}} that were <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the earlier hunter-gatherers and which were capable of creating substantial structures. The Neolithic in Scotland lasted from approximately 4000 to 2200 BC and Orkney as a whole has nearly 3,000 identified Neolithic sites all told. British archaeologists have often interpreted this era as having two distinct phases; the Earlier Neolithic dominated by regional styles of pottery and architecture followed by a relatively abrupt change into the Later Neolithic characterised by new traditions found throughout the British Isles that incorporate structures on a grander scale. In the Orcadian context, there are definite developments during the Neolithic, but the changes are gradual and tend to build on earlier ideas rather than appearing to form two distinct periods.|$|E
25|$|According to Buchanan and others, the Bush Doctrine was <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> former United States foreign policies, and a {{continuation}} of the ideological roots of neoconservatism.|$|E
40|$|President Carter 2 ̆ 7 s {{recognition}} of universal standards of human rights, and his formulation {{of a foreign}} policy at least partially based on such recognition, has been the object of both foreign and domestic criticism, which at first glance 2 ̆ 7 appears inexplicably severe. In {{the context of the}} present world legal order, however, the administration 2 ̆ 7 s expressed intention to pursue a policy directed toward a worldwide guarantee of human rights represents <b>a</b> potentially <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the legal tenets which have governed world political interaction for the last 300 years...|$|R
40|$|The article explores two {{waves of}} active externalism. I first {{introduce}} {{the distinction between}} passive and active externalism and analyse a proposal of active externalism {{based on the principle}} of parity proposed by Clark and Chalmers. There are two main obstacles, causal-constitution fallacy and cognitive bloat, that threaten the extended cognition hypothesis. The second wave of discussions based on the complementarity principle deals with cognitive systems with feedback loops between internal and external elements and is <b>a</b> more <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> functionalism and traditional thinking about cognition. I conclude with some remarks on potential ethical considerations of extended cognition...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} twenty years, Washington has oscillated between {{tentative}} engagement with Pyongyang under the Clinton administration and isolation and multilateralism under the Bush administration. With the Obama administration almost nearing its four-year tenure, the Six-Party Talks have stalled and North Korea's multiple attacks on the South in 2010 have created new instabilities. Why so little results despite promises of <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> away <b>from</b> the Axis of Evil rhetoric and hard-line politics? This paper suggests that the Obama administration has utilized approaches that no longer fit current circumstances and hence failed to create an original, coherent and effective foreign policy...|$|R
25|$|He {{wished to}} reach this `holy grail' of (theoretical/ mathematical) biology, but his heavy work load during the late 1960s—despite his related health problems—took its toll, and finally {{prevented}} him in 1972 from reaching his ultimate goal. Rashevsky's relational approach represents <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> reductionistic approaches, and it has greatly influenced {{the work of his}} student Robert Rosen.|$|E
25|$|The family intrigues that {{challenged}} his succession to {{the throne}} probably contributed to John's approach to rulership, which was to appoint men from outside the imperial family to help him govern the empire. This was <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the methods of his father, who had used the imperial family and its many connections to fill almost all senior administrative and military posts.|$|E
25|$|The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, {{the most}} {{hardline}} {{of all the}} Exclusive Brethren groups, has developed into a de facto hierarchical body which operates under the headship of an Elect Vessel, currently Bruce Hales of Australia. Some defectors have accused him and his predecessors of having quasi-papal authority. This development is almost universally considered by other streams of the Plymouth Brethren movement, however, as <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> Brethren principles.|$|E
500|$|Newsted {{left the}} band {{prior to the}} initial {{sessions}} for the album, and the band decided {{to wait until the}} album was recorded before finding a new permanent member. Recording of the album started initially on April 23, 2001, but was postponed indefinitely when rhythm guitarist and singer James Hetfield entered rehab for [...] "alcoholism and other addictions". St. Anger is often recognized for being <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> musical <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> Metallica's earlier work; it features a modern heavy metal style, raw production, and no guitar solos. The artwork was created by Pushead, who had previously collaborated with the band.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> more <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the rhyme table {{tradition}} was the Zhongyuan Yinyun, created by Zhōu Déqīng (...) in 1324 {{as a guide}} to the rhyming conventions of qu, a new vernacular verse form. The entries are grouped into 19 rhyme classes each identified by a pair of exemplary characters. The rhyme classes are subdivided by tone and then into groups of homophones, with no other indication of pronunciation. The even tone ( [...] píng) is divided in upper and lower tones called [...] yīnpíng and [...] yángpíng, respectively. Syllables in the checked tone are distributed between the other tones, but placed after the other syllables with labels such as [...] (rùshēng zuò qùshēng [...] "entering tone makes departing tone").|$|R
40|$|E. Richmond Olson (Canadian. Commissioner) {{spoke about}} the {{differences}} between this meeting and those of the past, and outlined the reasons for change. This meeting represents <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> in format <b>from</b> earlier ones, both in location and format. A conversational discussion is proposed rather than simply presenting the reports of the Boards, as in earlier meetings. Here also, copies of the (1983) reports were sent for your consideration in advance of this meeting...|$|R
25|$|A new flying Batmobile design {{appears in}} Batman Beyond {{used by the}} new Batman (Terry McGinnis). This version of the vehicle made {{multiple}} appearances {{in the future of}} the DC Universe as flying cars were shown as commonplace technology in this future. This design is <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the usual style of Batmobiles, as they usually have a bat motif, from a bat faceplate on the grill, to tail fins resembling bat wings.|$|E
25|$|In 1907, the German {{entrepreneur}} Carl Hagenbeck {{founded the}} Tierpark Hagenbeck in Stellingen, now {{a quarter of}} Hamburg. His zoo was <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> {{the layout of the}} zoo that had been established in 1828. It was the first zoo to use open enclosures surrounded by moats, rather than barred cages, to better approximate animals' natural environments. He also set up mixed-species exhibits and based the layout on the different organizing principle of geography, as opposed to taxonomy.|$|E
25|$|When the Lincoln one-cent coin {{made its}} initial {{appearance}} in 1909, it marked <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the accepted styling of United States coinage, {{as it was}} the first regular coin to bear a portrait other than the mythical Liberty which appeared on most pre-1909 regular coins. Previously, a strong feeling had prevailed against using portraits on coins in the United States, but public sentiment stemming from the 100th anniversary celebration of Abraham Lincoln's birth proved stronger than the long-standing tradition.|$|E
50|$|Stockholm Syndrome is {{the fifth}} solo studio album release from singer-songwriter Derek Webb. The mostly Electronic album was <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> in style <b>from</b> the guitar-driven folk and rock {{for which he had}} become known. Themes on the album {{surround}} asking difficult questions of Christians on sexuality, race, and social justice. It was critically acclaimed and commercially successful, becoming Webb's first solo album to break into the Billboard Top 200 albums chart.|$|R
25|$|The D.V {{version was}} <b>a</b> less <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the earlier D.II version and mostly {{differed}} from the D.II, in having its four-member cabane strut structure supporting a central panel for the upper wing, rather than both upper wing panel's wing roots meeting along the centreline of the aircraft, for better forward pilot vision. It also used the D.III version's Argus As.II engine and changed the mounting position of the aircraft's 7.92mm (.312in) lMG 08 machine gun from the right {{to the left side}} of the nose. A total of 57 D.V aircraft were built, from orders placed in October 1916 and January–June 1917, with 31 of these being sent to Germany's ally in the Central Powers, the Ottoman Empire.|$|R
40|$|Having passed {{successive}} {{legislation in}} the past two decades to expand its use of the Japan Self Defense Force (JSDF), Japan has emerged from its post-war ‘pacifist’ shackles to assume a range of security roles that are typically associated with so-called ‘normal nations’. This article addresses how these have been crystallized in the form of an indefinitely-termed overseas base on the Horn of Africa, in Djibouti. Careful examination of pertaining Diet minutes, media discourse and government ministry papers suggests that the risks identified with this facility’s realization and status have been fundamentally recalibrated, allowing its presence and operational diversification to go largely unnoticed and unopposed – both domestically and overseas – despite representing <b>a</b> seemingly <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> common sense interpretations of Japan’s antimilitarist constitution...|$|R
25|$|In the mid-1970s, Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), the {{drilling}} subsidiary of Dome Petroleum, began {{drilling for oil}} in the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea using ice-strengthened drillships and an extensive support fleet of icebreaking vessels. Aiming for year-round operations, the company also began developing its own experimental icebreaker concepts to support exploration drilling and, eventually, production-related operations. The first vessel of this research and development program was the 1979-built Canmar Kigoriak which represented <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> conventional icebreaker designs with, among other features, a single-shaft mechanical propulsion system instead of a more commonly-used diesel-electric powertrain.|$|E
25|$|The 1950s were a {{significant}} period {{of change and}} reform within Anglican and other Christian denominations throughout Australia, as they sought to become more relevant to contemporary society. Developments in religious theology and liturgy, coupled with an expansionary building program, led to <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> established architectural traditions. Reflecting international trends, church designs moved away from historical revival styles and became increasingly influenced by Modernism. However, {{it was expected that}} a church would still be recognisable as such, resulting {{in a wide range of}} variations combining traditional church elements, symbols and functions with new construction techniques, materials and forms.|$|E
25|$|During the New Kingdom the pharaoh Akhenaten {{abolished}} the official worship of other gods {{in favor of}} the sun-disk Aten. This is often seen as the first instance of true monotheism in history, although the details of Atenist theology are still unclear and the suggestion that it was monotheistic is disputed. The exclusion of all but one god from worship was <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> Egyptian tradition and some see Akhenaten as a practitioner of monolatry rather than monotheism, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshipping any but the Aten. Under Akhenaten's successors Egypt reverted to its traditional religion, and Akhenaten himself came to be reviled as a heretic.|$|E

These same fans had also wanted a cheaper, stripped-down iPhone 4.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Traditional {{approaches}} for semantic storage and analysis are facing their {{limits on the}} handling of enormous data amounts of today’s applications. We believe that <b>a</b> more <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> contemporary architectures of stores is necessary to satisfy that central scalability requirement. One {{of the most promising}} new schools of thought in system design are swarm intelligent and swarm-based {{approaches for}} data distribution and organization. In this paper, we describe our current work on a swarm-based storage service for Semantic Web data. 1 Introduction and Related Work Semantic applications share the need for an efficient and scalable storage service which can handle huge amounts of semantic data. The performance and scalability level of the storage services will be defined by use case scenarios, e. g. the future Semantic Web applications need to scale {{to the size of the}} We...|$|R
