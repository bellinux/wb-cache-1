5|$|Democratic transhumanists, such as American {{sociologist}} James Hughes, {{counter that}} many influential {{members of the}} United States Establishment are bioconservatives strongly opposed to human enhancement, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by President Bush's Council on Bioethics's proposed international treaty prohibiting human cloning and germline engineering. Furthermore, he argues that conspiracy theorists underestimate how fringe the transhumanist movement really is.|$|E
5|$|In the 1st century AD rich burials first {{appeared}} and Tikal underwent {{a political and}} cultural florescence as its giant northern neighbors declined. At {{the end of the}} Late Preclassic, the Izapan style art and architecture from the Pacific Coast began to influence Tikal, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by a broken sculpture from the acropolis and early murals at the city.|$|E

5|$|Spiral galaxies {{resemble}} spiraling pinwheels.

5|$|Who's Your City? {{is divided}} into four parts {{with a total of}} 16 chapters. The first part {{presents}} data that suggests the world's population and economy are becoming increasingly geographically concentrated into few mega-regions, such as BosWash and the San Francisco Bay Area. Thomas Friedman's Flat World Theory, or his assertion that distance and place is becoming irrelevant, is countered by Florida with maps of population growth, economic activity, innovation (<b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by patent registration), and scientific discovery (<b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by residence of the most heavily cited scientists).|$|E

5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and {{are attracted to}} areas where males are calling, which they do {{for about an hour}} after sunset. This may be in order to mate, or they may be influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg-laying, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Further {{calculations}} of this ilk combine {{to show that}} the number of essentially different Sudoku grids is 5,472,730,538, for example <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by Jarvis / Russell and verified by Pettersen. Similar methods have been applied to the 2x3 case, where Jarvis / Russell showed that there are 49 essentially different grids (see also the article by Bailey, Cameron and Connelly), to the 2x4 case, where Russell showed that there are 1,673,187 essentially different grids (verified by Pettersen), and to the 2x5 case where Pettersen showed that there are 4,743,933,602,050,718 essentially different grids (not verified).|$|E
5|$|Further, birds {{recall and}} avoid {{objects that are}} both {{conspicuous}} and foul-tasting longer than objects that are equally foul-tasting but cryptically coloured. This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured, was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also innately avoid conspicuously coloured objects, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works {{at least in part}} by stimulating the evolution of predators to encode the meaning of the warning signal, rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal's meaning.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to pilgrims, merchants often used the safe route across Hungary when travelling between Constantinople and Western Europe. Stephen's legends refer to 60 wealthy Pechenegs who travelled to Hungary, but {{were attacked by}} Hungarian border guards. The king sentenced his soldiers to death in order to demonstrate his determination to preserve internal peace. Regular minting of coinage began in Hungary in the 1020s. Stephen's silver dinars bearing the inscriptions STEPHANUS REX ("King Stephen") and REGIA CIVITAS ("royal city") were popular in contemporary Europe, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by counterfeited copies unearthed in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg's stages are not {{culturally}} neutral, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by {{its application}} {{to a number of}} different cultures. Although they progress through the stages in the same order, individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates. Kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Quiriguá {{suffered}} a hiatus from {{the turn of}} the 6th century that lasted through {{to the middle of the}} 7th century. This may be linked to the Tikal hiatus of the Middle Classic caused by Tikal's defeat by Calakmul. There is evidence that Quiriguá {{suffered a}}n attack by unknown enemies in this period, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by the apparently deliberate defacement of Stela U and Monument26, characteristic of damage inflicted by invading warriors. No monuments were erected during this hiatus, which lasted from 495 to 653.|$|E

5|$|Schleswig-Holstein was {{put into}} dock for repairs 10–25 June 1916. The Navy then decided to {{withdraw}} the four remaining Deutschland-class ships, owing to their obsolescence and vulnerability to underwater attacks, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> {{by the loss of}} Pommern. Thereafter, the ship was used as a target for U-boats, except during 12–23 February 1917 when she was used as a guard ship. In April Schleswig-Holstein was sent to Altenbruch {{at the mouth of the}} Elbe; here she was decommissioned on 2 May. Schleswig-Holstein was then disarmed and assigned to the 5th U-boat Flotilla to be used as a barracks ship in Bremerhaven. In 1918 the ship was moved to Kiel, where she remained for the rest of the war.|$|E
5|$|Telescopic {{observations}} in the mid-20th century began to hint at Io's unusual nature. Spectroscopic observations suggested that Io's surface was devoid of water ice (a substance {{found to be}} plentiful on the other Galilean satellites). The same observations suggested a surface dominated by evaporates composed of sodium salts and sulfur. Radiotelescopic observations revealed Io's influence on the Jovian magnetosphere, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by decametric wavelength bursts tied to the orbital period of Io.|$|E
5|$|The advancements in portraying {{realistic}} emotions {{achieved with}} Final Fantasy X through voice-overs and detailed facial expressions have since become {{a staple of}} the series, with Final Fantasy X-2 and other subsequent titles (such as , Final Fantasy XII, XIII and its sequels, and XV) also featuring this development. Traversing real-time 3D environments instead of an overworld map has also become a standard of the series, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in Final Fantasy XI, XII, XIII and its sequels, XIV and XV. Final Fantasy X can be considered a pioneer in 3-D RPG maps.|$|E
