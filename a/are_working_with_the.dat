25|$|Outriggers {{are used}} to stop using a {{technique}} that involves bringing the skiers elbows from their raised position down to their hips while pushing the outriggers down. When using the outrigger, skiers do not rotate their arms as this changes {{the location of the}} ski on the snow. Skiers with below the knee amputations get on and off the ski lift using the same technique as able-bodied skiers. Cerebral palsy skiers in this class may have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise. This presents challenges for coaches who <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> skier. Compared to other skiers in the class, the skier with cerebral palsy may tire more quickly.|$|E

When going up hill, they often have their weaker side on the uphill side. In learning to ski, a ski bra {{is often used to}} teach the proper technique. Skiers sometimes have difficulty with the snowplough technique. In teaching skiers with {{cerebral palsy}}, instructors are encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them.

25|$|Kollam is {{the largest}} pencil slat {{manufacturing}} hub in India. There are more than 150 slat production units in the city employing roughly 5,000 persons. A {{good portion of the}} demand for pencil slats in the country is met by these units. 35% of the world's pencil slats are manufactured in Kerala. Of the 170 odd pencil slat manufacturing units in Kerala, 125 are based in and around Kollam district. These units export 160 loads of slats per month to companies across the world. This, according to slat manufacturers, is enough to make 200 million pencils per month. A slat is of 185mm length, 77mm width and 5.5mm thickness. Each load exported contains 300 bags with 900 slats bundled into each. On an average each month 150 loads of pencil slats are shipped to pencil factories based in Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai and various places in Gujarat. Over 30 countries depend on Kollam's pencil slat manufacturers for pencil making under different brand names. These factories <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> support of their associations: the Kerala Slats Factories Association and the Kerala State Small Industries Association (KSSIA).

500|$|The local {{controlling}} council, Tendring District Council, <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{residents of}} Brooklands on improving {{the area and}} trying to buy up land to build new housing. Council leader Mick Page stated [...] "The only way we will start anything in Jaywick {{is for us to}} lead it. We will be the catalyst." [...] The council are proposing to stop the allocation of housing benefit to rented properties in Jaywick by 2017, to discourage rental in poor quality buildings. Former council leader Neil Stock has called Jaywick [...] "an embarrassment to the whole country", blaming planning regulations he believes are draconian. Stock reported around 30 to 40 absentee landlords were renting poor quality accommodation to tenants on benefits without requiring any deposit, adding that [...] "the state is subsidising squalor." [...] Carswell has been critical of the government's response to Jaywick, noting that although the area contained large numbers of unemployed, these were often people who were unable to find work both due to disabilities or a lack of available jobs. He believes the [...] "downward spiral will continue" [...] unless existing planning laws are relaxed and the area has economic investment.|$|E

[...] Jedidiah Jenkins, the director of idea development for Invisible Children, responded to the new criticisms by saying that they were [...] "myopic" [...] and that the video itself was a [...] "tipping point" [...] that [...] "got young people to care about an issue {{on the other side of}} the planet that doesn’t affect them." [...] In response to concerns about working with the Ugandan government, Invisible Children explained that they [...] "do not defend any of the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Ugandan government or the Ugandan army". They added that the reason why they <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Ugandan army even though Kony is no longer in Uganda is that the army is [...] "more organized and better equipped than that of any of the other affected countries (DRC, South Sudan, CAR) to track down Joseph Kony" [...] and that they want all of the governments in the region to work together to arrest Kony. Jenkins stated, [...] "There is a huge problem with political corruption in Africa. If we had the purity to say we will not partner with anyone corrupt, we couldn’t partner with anyone." ...|$|E

2500|$|Programmers {{who support}} the {{open-source}} movement philosophy contribute to the open-source community by voluntarily writing and exchanging programming code for software development. The term [...] "open source" [...] requires {{that no one can}} discriminate against a group in not sharing the edited code or hinder others from editing their already-edited work. This approach to software development allows anyone to obtain and modify open-source code. These modifications are distributed back to the developers within the open-source community of people who <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> software. In this way, the identities of all individuals participating in code modification are disclosed and the transformation of the code is documented over time. This method makes it difficult to establish ownership of a particular bit of code but is in keeping with the open-source movement philosophy. These goals promote the production of [...] "high quality programs" [...] as well as [...] "working cooperatively with other similarly minded people" [...] to improve open-source technology.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} days of the Enchanted Forest, a young Snow White is asked to defend her kingdom by [...] from bandits who <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Evil Queen but flees into the forest, believing she cannot help them with her father away. After she falls into a hunting trap Snow is saved by Hercules, who is on a quest to {{complete}} the final part of his Twelve Labors, which is to hunt down Cerberus. He encourages Snow White not to give up, and he even offers to train her for battle, suggesting that she fight the bandits herself. When Snow faces the bandits, she foolishly drops her arrows, then loses her dignity when Hercules defends her. Using his past mistakes and learning from them, Hercules inspires her to try again, and she successfully aims at the bandits' weapons, prompting the bandits to leave the kingdom, and setting up her future as the bandit princess. Snow White thanks Hercules for helping her and says she will make a great Queen and Olympus will have a great hero like him and they kiss each goodbye.|$|E
