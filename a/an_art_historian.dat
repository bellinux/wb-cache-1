Her parents were interned in concentration camps while Franklin herself {{was sent to a}} forced labour camp. The family survived The Holocaust and was reunited in Berlin after the war.|$|E

25|$|On 4 October 1939 in Berlin, Adolf Hitler {{issued the}} order {{to blow up the}} Royal Castle. On 10 October 1939, special German units, under the {{supervision}} of history and art experts (Dr. Dagobert Frey, <b>an</b> <b>art</b> <b>historian</b> at the University of Wrocław; Gustaw Barth, the director of museums in Wrocław, and Dr. Joseph Mühlmann, <b>an</b> <b>art</b> <b>historian</b> from Vienna) started to demount floor, marbles, sculptures and stone elements such as fireplaces or moulds. The artefacts were taken to Germany or stored in Kraków's warehouses. Many of them were also seized by various Nazi dignitaries who resided in Warsaw. The Castle was totally emptied. Disobeying German orders, despite the danger of being shot, Polish museum staff and experts in art restoration managed to save many of the works of art from the castle, as well as fragments of the stucco-work, the parquet floors, the wood panelling, and more which were later used in the reconstruction. The great service done to Poland by Professor Stanisław Lorentz, in leading this campaign to save the castle's treasures, is well known. Wehrmacht sappers then bored tens of thousands of holes for dynamite charges in the stripped walls.|$|E

25|$|Vladimir Igorevich Arnold {{was born}} on 12 June 1937 in Odessa, Soviet Union. His father was Igor Vladimirovich Arnold (1900–1948), a mathematician. His mother was Nina Alexandrovna Arnold (1909–1986, née Isakovich), <b>an</b> <b>art</b> <b>historian.</b> When Arnold was thirteen, an uncle who was an {{engineer}} told him about calculus and {{how it could be}} used to understand some physical phenomena, this contributed to spark his interest for mathematics, and he started to study by himself the mathematical books his father had left to him, which included some works of Leonhard Euler and Charles Hermite.|$|E

25|$|The liberal group, rallied from 1909 around Straucher's {{newspaper}} Die Volkswehr ("People's Defense"), {{was soon}} {{drawn into a}} fierce competition with socialist Jews, including not just with the Bundistn, but also sympathizers of Poale Zion. The Kultusgemeinde was by then Straucher's prime basis of support in parliamentary elections, and, after the 1911 elections (during which he faced no opposition from Ebner's group), {{he was the only}} one among the four of his fellow candidates in the 1907 elections to maintain his seat. Of the latter, Arthur Mahler left the Jewish nationalist movement and returned to his career as <b>an</b> <b>art</b> <b>historian.</b>|$|E
25|$|While in Paris, Rorimer had an auspicious {{encounter}} with Rose Valland, <b>an</b> <b>art</b> <b>historian</b> and {{employee of the}} Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume. During the German occupation of France, the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce—the Nazi organization {{in charge of the}} systematic looting of art and cultural artifacts—designated the Jeu de Paume museum as the central location for storing and sorting their stolen treasures. Valland was {{the only member of the}} museum’s original staff retained by the Nazis. She spied on the Nazis, who did not realize that she spoke German, and kept detailed records on the transportation of artwork stolen by members of the Third Reich. She passed information on to the French Resistance and to Rorimer.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{any work}} of art that existed prior to 1945 has a {{potential}} provenance problem. This is a serious obstacle for anyone who currently collects pre-1945 European art. To avoid wasting thousands or even millions of dollars, they must verify (normally {{with the assistance of}} <b>an</b> <b>art</b> <b>historian</b> and a lawyer specializing in art law) that potential acquisitions were not stolen by the Nazis from a Holocaust victim. The highest-profile legal case arising from this problem is the U.S. Supreme Court decision of Republic of Austria v. Altmann (2006), in which the Court held that U.S. courts could retroactively apply the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 to Austria for torts that allegedly occurred before 1976.|$|E
