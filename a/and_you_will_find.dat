Regarding her role, Saran said that she would be seen as a poor but content farmer in the flashback sequences and a doctor in the present day. She added [...] "My character goes back to 1930s and comes back in the present era. I can't tell how it happens though.

This request angered Mountbatten, who {{had hoped to}} have that position in both dominions—he would be India's first post-independence governor-general—but Jinnah felt that Mountbatten {{would be likely to}} favour the new Hindu-majority state because of his closeness to Nehru. In addition, the governor-general would initially be a powerful figure, and Jinnah did not trust anyone else to take that office.

Okabayashi during his lengthy morning sessions acting uke, or receiver of techniques for Takeda noticed that his movements always seem to conform to this principle while other teachers, even {{those who had been}} taught by Tokimune did not always move so.

It was at this point that Laplace's loyalty began to weaken. Although he still had easy access to Napoleon, his personal relations with the emperor cooled considerably. As a grieving father, he was particularly cut to the quick by Napoleon's insensitivity in an exchange related by Jean-Antoine Chaptal: [...] "On his return from the rout in Leipzig, he [...] accosted Mr Laplace: 'Oh!
