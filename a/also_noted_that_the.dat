5|$|Reviewers {{wrote that}} Peshkin's account was fair, and praised his {{decision}} to let the participants speak for themselves through quotations. They <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> book filled a literary lacuna in scholarly understanding of the rapidly expanding and understudied fundamentalist Christian school.|$|E
5|$|According to Jesús Pastor Paloma, an Agustinian Recollect priest, the {{structure}} was also {{supposed to have}} a prefabricated retablo (reredos) altar, which was lost at sea when the ship carrying it from Belgium capsized in a storm; a wooden altar was made locally in its stead. Paloma <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bottom part of the church was designed to resemble a ship's hull, so that it would sway during an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Benny Benke, {{writing for}} the Semarang-based daily Suara Merdeka, found that Bramantyo had used ? to portray {{tolerance}} in Indonesia without making the subject seem cliché; however, he considered some scenes, such as Hendra's conversion, overdone. Frans Sartono, reviewing for the historically Catholic daily Kompas, considered the film heavily didactic but ultimately interesting, because its social commentary was much needed, considering Indonesia's religious turmoil. He <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> characters were driven to their actions by worldly needs and not religion.|$|E

5|$|By {{the fall}} of his junior season, the Illinois class of 2014 was being {{mentioned}} {{as one of the}} all-time great statewide classes of basketball players. Chicago Sun-Times writer Joe Henricksen noted that there was a high chance that this would be the fifth Illinois class and first since 2002 to include three McDonald's All-Americans. He <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> class has a chance to rival if not surpass the classes of 1998 and 2011 which each had nine top 100 players.|$|E
5|$|Fogleman's {{investigation}} led {{to several}} of the officers involved in the incident receiving further administrative discipline. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) subsequently refused U.S. Senate subpoenas for four USAF officers {{to be interviewed for}} the Senate investigation, which was never publicly released. The U.S. House investigation, conducted in part by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), found that the military investigative and judicial systems had operated mostly as designed, but <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> DoD had refused access to key witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Harvey <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fatwa {{covered a}} wide range of Islamic {{religious}} duties, while usually a responsum fatwa only addresses a specific enquiry on a difficult point of detail. The fatwa also went into specific practical challenges faced by Muslims in Spain, such as the pressure to curse Muhammad, eat pork, drink wine, and intermarry with the Christians. This suggests that the author had some knowledge of what life under Christian rule was like.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the pessimistic view of the south taken by the Khartoum administration, he was enthusiastic about the wealth and diversity of plants. He noted that the people had adapted to cultivating non-native plants such as cassava, maize, sweet potato and groundnuts. He <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government was restricting commercial development of sugarcane, tobacco and coffee, which grew wild, and thus preventing economic development.|$|E
5|$|Organizers {{attempted}} {{to respond to}} public concern by asking sponsors to consider reducing their orders and by paying $1.5 million to add 2,600 seats to the Saddledome. King <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Calgary Games offered a then-record 1.7 million tickets for sale, three times the amount available at Sarajevo or Lake Placid, and that 82 percent of them were going to Calgarians. By their start, a Winter Games' record of over 1.4 million tickets had been sold, a figure that eclipsed the previous three Winter Games combined.|$|E
5|$|Some reviewers {{praised the}} new laptop's {{performance}} and compact size, {{the quality of}} the screen, and sturdy unibody build, which allowed easier upgrading of internal components as compared to the original models. Some reviewers <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new MacBook Pro ran more quietly and at cooler temperatures than first generation machines. Others, however, criticized the amount of heat generated by the new design.|$|E

5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{initially}} forecast further intensification to 60mph (95km/h), {{although the}} agency <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> circulation could dissipate, due its fast forward motion toward the east-northeast. Ultimately, wind shear prohibited significant strengthening, and Leslie attained peak winds of 45mph (70km/h). The storm interacted with an approaching cold front and became extratropical on October7, 375mi (600km) north of Bermuda. It accelerated {{to the northeast}} and passed over Newfoundland on October8. The remnants of Leslie turned to the east, then southeast, strengthening to near-hurricane-force winds before losing its identity near Ireland on October10.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples {{recognized}} {{the urgent need}} to respect and promote the rights of indigenous peoples affirmed in treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements with States. It <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rights affirmed in treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements between States and indigenous peoples are, in some situations, matters of international concern, interest, responsibility and character. In many instances the minority rights treaties provided for arbitration and granted the International Court of Justice jurisdiction to resolve disputes.|$|E
5|$|The World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong further called {{attention}} to portrayals of Wang Jindong on state-run television, claiming {{that the man who}} self-immolated on the square was not the same person who appeared in subsequent interviews with CCTV. It pointed to a voice analysis conducted by the Speech Processing Laboratory at National Taiwan University, which concluded that the voices did not match, and <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hairline and facial proportions appeared to be different. These observations were used to advance the theory that the self-immolators were actors.|$|E

Gordon Stein <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{gap between the two}} balconies was only four feet making passing between them entirely feasible.|$|E
5|$|Utami has <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{novel is}} a {{reflection}} of her own restlessness and anxiety. Although little of it directly reflects events in her life, she notes that Saman's loss of religion reflects her own, and the book reflects her belief that a double standard exists regarding virginity in Indonesian culture. Although the novel touches on racial harmony, Utami said that she considers the theme to be undeveloped.|$|E
5|$|Young {{birds were}} often {{captured}} {{and kept in}} menageries both in India and in Europe in former times. They were also successfully bred in captivity early in the 17th century by Emperor Jehangir who <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eggs were laid with an interval of two days and that incubation period was 34 days. They were also bred in zoos in Europe and the United States in the early 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Dick Versace, the Grizzlies' {{president}} of basketball operations, {{stated in the}} final Vancouver season {{that the company was}} losing US$40million per season. These numbers were questioned by Richard Peddie, CEO of the Raptors, as the Grizzlies had a salary cap of US$48million. Retrospectively, Heisley stated that he lost US$87million on owning the Grizzlies, although that included a US$30million relocation fee to the NBA. Versace stated that he felt that the team did not get sufficient support from the business community. Colin Jones, University of Victoria professor in sports economics, stated that it was difficult to attract corporate sponsors as long as the team was losing so many games; the Grizzlies lack of good draft picks lead to the team failing to win, thus losing revenue. He <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> team never sought help in the general business community regarding management issues.|$|E
5|$|Executives from Endemol, the {{production}} company for Big Brother worldwide, defended the format which is transmitted in 41 territories and noted the season {{premiere of the}} 11th season in America won its timeslot with year-to-year growth. Other comparisons noted was the finale of ninth season of Italy's Grande Fratello pulled 7.9 million viewers with a 36% audience share and how in Argentina the show has been rested {{for a few years}} and returns with stronger ratings. Paul Jonson, global head of marketing and brand partnerships for Endemol Group, noted that using audience averages to figure out how the show performs wouldn't work since the audience builds up until the finale. Jonson <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> series continued to rate very well when compared to the timeslot average for Channel 4.|$|E
5|$|Harmon {{thought that}} Far Cry 4 was an {{improvement}} over Far Cry 3, but {{he thought that the}} game felt and played too similarly to Far Cry 3, and he added that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for Far Cry 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by Far Cry 4 did not stray far away from Far Cry 3. Tan <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game's open world design felt not only similar to Far Cry 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by Far Cry 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.|$|E
