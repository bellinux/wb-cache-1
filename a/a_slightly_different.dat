5|$|A {{different}} {{version of}} In the Lounge was also created. This includes the same 9 original tracks, although in <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> order. It {{does not include}} the two indie songs; however, it does feature Rich Ragsdale's NOLF title theme, as well as remixes of 6 of the original songs, by Gabriel Mann.|$|E
5|$|A second, more {{traditional}} design followed {{for the initial}} batch of five unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6230–6234). Again they were of welded tank construction, but lacked any of the streamlining add-ons. Even without the streamlining Type 'B' tenders were distinguishable from Type 'A' by having <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> profile at the front and steps and handrails at the rear.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> {{version of}} the short story was {{featured}} in the November 1991 issue of Omni. The OMNI version concerns an unnamed girl and an old man named Skinner who live in the one-room shack built on top of the first cable tower of the Bridge. This version was collected in Gardner Dozois' 1992 anthology , and in Larry McCaffery's After Yesterday's Crash (1995).|$|E
5|$|As {{the morning}} progressed {{and the light}} changed he would switch to {{sequentially}} later canvas settings, sometimes working on as many as ten or twelve paintings a day, each one depicting <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> aspect of light. The process would be repeated {{over the course of}} days, weeks, or months, depending on the weather and the progress of the paintings until they were completed. As the seasons changed the process was renewed.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{varieties}} of the two-colored bolete: borealis and subreticulatus. Both varieties {{have a very}} similar habitat {{to that of the}} main species, except they appear to be limited to just the North American continent. Both varieties also have <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> coloration than that of the two-colored bolete, have deeper pores, and are not as often eaten or used in regional recipes.|$|E

5|$|Another {{series of}} towers were built between 1658 and 1659. Fourteen towers {{were built in}} all, which are {{together}} known as the De Redin towers. These {{were based on the}} Lascaris towers and had the same function as a communication link. 13 towers were built on mainland Malta having an identical design, and 8 of these survive intact while 2 are in ruins. The fourteenth tower, Mġarr ix-Xini Tower, was built on Gozo in 1661 with <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> design.|$|E
5|$|Bipartite verbal {{compounds}} such {{as these}} are not peculiar to any language in particular. They are in fact very common, and may even occur in every language, albeit with varying frequency. English {{has a number of}} complex predicates, include go sightseeing, have breakfast and take (a) bath. The event described by go sightseeing is unable to be described using a single verb sightsee; inflections like sightsaw and sightseen are ungrammatical. An event like take (a) bath, however, may be described by a single verb bathe, but it arguably has <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> meaning. Take (a) bath, in any case, is far more common.|$|E
5|$|GTAW is most {{commonly}} used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. The process grants the operator greater control over the weld than competing processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding, allowing for stronger, higher quality welds. However, GTAW is comparatively more complex and difficult to master, and furthermore, it is significantly slower than most other welding techniques. A related process, plasma arc welding, uses <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> welding torch {{to create a more}} focused welding arc and as a result is often automated.|$|E

5|$|Hammond organs have a {{built-in}} vibrato effect {{that provides a}} small variation in pitch while a note is being played, and a chorus effect where a note's sound is combined with another sound at <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> and varying pitch. The best known vibrato and chorus system consists of six settings, V1, V2, V3, C1, C2 and C3 (i.e., three each of vibrato and chorus), which can be selected via a rotary switch. Vibrato / chorus can be selected for each manual independently.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} the 20th century that a common, {{standardized}} national language became available to all Swedes. The orthography was finally stabilized, and was almost completely uniform, {{with the exception of}} some minor deviations, {{by the time of the}} spelling reform of 1906. With the exception of plural forms of verbs and <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> syntax, particularly in the written language, the language was the same as the Swedish of today. The plural verb forms appeared decreasingly in formal writing into the 1950s, when their use was removed from all official recommendations.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Strauss {{works that}} are {{performed}} today may once have existed in <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> form, as Eduard Strauss destroyed {{much of the}} original Strauss orchestral archives in a furnace factory in Vienna's Mariahilf district in 1907. Eduard, then the only surviving brother of the three, took this drastic precaution after agreeing to a pact between himself and brother Josef that whoever outlived the other was to destroy their works. The measure was intended to prevent the Strauss family's works from being claimed by another composer. This {{may also have been}} fueled by Strauss's rivalry with another of Vienna's popular waltz and march composers, Karl Michael Ziehrer.|$|E
50|$|Although yin qu {{has been}} said to have merged with yang ping (these are also close in Wenzhou, both being falling tones), the {{consonant}} voicing remains distinct. <b>A</b> second, <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> transcription of Wencheng tone is reported, presumably largely due to speaker differences.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, the {{traditional}} words {{were set to}} <b>a</b> new, <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> melody by Irish composer Shaun Davey. In 2002, he orchestrated this version for orchestra, choir, pipes, fiddle, and percussion to commemorate {{the opening of the}} Helix Concert Hall, Dublin, Ireland.|$|R
5|$|There are two video {{versions}}; {{one that}} uses the album track and another that uses <b>a</b> version <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> from the album track. Both versions are identical until the last verse (3:20) which uses different vocals (This version is not available on The Essential Video Collection).|$|R
5|$|Sections {{of what is}} now NY23 {{were part}} of {{unsigned}} legislative routes as early as 1908; however, NY23 itself was not assigned until 1924. At the time, the route extended from Oneonta to Massachusetts and followed <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> alignment from Cairo to Claverack via Hudson that took the route along modern County Route23B (CR23B) in eastern Greene County. NY23 was extended west to Norwich in the mid-1920s and to NY26 in northwestern Chenango County in 1930. The route was gradually moved onto its current alignment between Cairo and Claverack in the 1950s and 1960s, and realigned on its western end in 1984 to serve Cortland County.|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{locomotives}} of {{the first}} production batch were split equally between Brighton and Ashford works, and all were completed by December 1929. The production locomotives had <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> profile to the K class rebuilds and featured left-hand drive to improve the visibility of signals from the driver's side of the footplate. They also had higher running plates {{along the sides of}} the boiler than the rebuilds, which required smaller wheel splashers to cover the tops of the driving wheels. Another variation was the flatter top to the dome covers, as the rebuilds retained the high N class type used on the K class.|$|E
5|$|The Blue Line was {{originally}} planned to follow <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> route. The plan {{would have sent}} Blue Line trains to Huntington, with Yellow Line trains serving Franconia–Springfield. This was changed due to a shortage of rail cars {{at the time of}} the completion of the line to Huntington. Because fewer rail cars were required to operate Yellow Line service than would be required to run Blue Line service out to Huntington – due to the Yellow Line's shorter route – the line designations were switched. From 1999 to 2008, the Blue Line operated to Huntington on July 4, as part of Metro's special Independence Day service pattern.|$|E

5|$|The cap {{badge of}} the RWY is the Prince of Wales's {{feathers}} is <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> design to other regiments {{wearing the same}} symbol, such as the Royal Regiment of Wales. It is worn on the brown beret with a red baize and a black baize backing. During the First World War, men from the RWY carved their cap badge into the chalk hillside above the village of Fovant where it can still be seen today, alongside those of other units.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} girdle is well known. Both {{the left and}} right scapulae and coracoids are known, though incomplete. The scapulae are large, and robust, and thicken as they near the glenoids. The scapular blades are flat, although they are both convex along the anterior edge. Where the scapulae and coracoids articulate, the coracoids are thickest, and they become gradually thinner as they gain distance from the scapulae. The younger specimen of Patagosaurus possesses <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> morphology of the {{pectoral girdle}}, with slightly differing proportions, such as a slightly smaller scapular blade. The coracoids resemble Barapasaurus in shape, and differ from Camarasaurus, although they cannot be directly compared with those of Cetiosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The three serotypes of poliovirus, PV1, PV2, and PV3, {{each have}} <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> capsid protein. Capsid {{proteins}} define cellular receptor specificity and virus antigenicity. PV1 {{is the most}} common form encountered in nature, but all three forms are extremely infectious. As of November 2015, wild PV1 is highly localized to regions in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Wild PV2 was declared eradicated in September 2015 after last being detected in October 1999 in Uttar Pradesh, India. As of November 2015, wild PV3 has not been seen since its 2012 detection in parts of Nigeria and Pakistan.|$|E
50|$|Although {{calculations}} {{of the first}} 3&times;108 values of the sequence appeared to show its density converging to <b>a</b> value <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> from 1/2, later calculations that extended the sequence to its first 1013 values show the deviation from a density of 1/2 growing smaller, {{as one would expect}} if the limiting density actually is 1/2.|$|R
50|$|The Abbotsbury village school {{closed in}} 1981 and the {{children}} no longer get a day's holiday. This {{has led to the}} celebrations taking place in the evening or on the nearest Saturday.

50|$|In 2013, {{the show}} {{returned}} for <b>a</b> new, <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> series: it {{was moved to}} Saturdays, renamed 7 Day Saturday, had 11 episodes between 8 June and 24 August, kept Al Murray as host, and featured Andy Zaltzman and two guests each programme. There was also a Christmas special, 7 Days of Christmas, broadcast on 24 December 2013.|$|R
