40|$|Consider the {{following}} counterfactual claims: (1) that, if the World Trade Center had not collapsed, everything {{else would have}} been maximally similar to how it <b>actually</b> <b>was</b> (2) that, if the World Trade Center had not collapsed and everything else had been maximally similar to how it <b>actually</b> <b>was,</b> everything else would have been maximally similar to how it <b>actually</b> <b>was.</b> Robert Stalnaker says: Consider a possible world in which A is true, and which otherwise differs minimally from the actual world. “If A, then B ” is true (false) just in case B is true (false) in that possible world. (1968, pp. 33 ‐ 34) On Stalnaker’s analysis, (1) and (2) are equivalent to (S 1) and (S 2), respectively: (S 1) that, in the nearest possible {{world in which the}} World Trade Center did not collapse, everything else is maximally similar to how it <b>actually</b> <b>is</b> (S 2) that, in the nearest possible world in which the World Trade Center did not collapse and everything else is maximally similar to how it <b>actually</b> <b>is...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{area has}} been a major focus of modern Egyptological {{exploration}} for the last two centuries. Prior to this time it was a site for tourism in antiquity (especially during Roman times). This area illustrates the changes in the study of ancient Egypt, starting as antiquity hunting, and ending as scientific excavation of the whole Theban Necropolis.

5|$|After {{his victory}} in the battle, Richard III is unintentionally killed by Lord Edmund Plantagenet; Richard {{attempts}} to take Edmund's horse, which he thinks is his own. Not recognizing the king, Edmund thinks Richard is stealing it and cuts his head off. The late King's nephew, Richard, Duke of York (played by Brian Blessed) who is Lord Edmund Plantagenet's father, is then crowned as Richard IV. Lord Edmund himself did not {{take part in the}} battle after arriving late, but later claims to have killed 450 peasants and several nobles, one of whom had <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> killed by his brother in the battle.|$|E

5|$|After recovering, {{he joined}} the Kimberley Mounted Corps and guided two {{officers}} from Lichtenburg to Klerksdorp, where they persuaded the Boers to surrender by bluffing that a strong British force was following close behind. The Boers soon retook the town and Guest was captured. He was sent with other prisoners to Pietersburg to be executed {{but he managed to}} escape and travelled to Warmbaths. After satisfying the authorities that he had <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> taken prisoner and had not surrendered voluntarily, he returned to his depot at Kimberley. His unit had been disbanded and he was discharged.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} {{was suggested}} by Brooks: Penda might have lost power {{at some point}} after Heavenfield, and Eowa may have <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> ruling the Mercians {{for at least some}} of the period as a subject ally or puppet of Oswald. Brooks cited Bede's statement implying that Penda's fortunes were mixed during his 22 years in power and noted the possibility that Penda's fortunes were low at this time. Thus it may be that Penda was not consistently the dominant figure in Mercia during the years between Hatfield and Maserfield. argues against the idea that Penda and Eowa were co-rulers, and favours the idea that Eowa was ruling Mercia from c. 635 until 642.|$|E
5|$|Bird had <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> {{drafted the}} year before, but later {{decided to stay}} an {{additional}} year, and the two superstars both entered the league in 1979, leading their respective teams to dazzling heights. Johnson and the Showtime Lakers reached the 1980 NBA Finals against the 76ers, which was also led by NBA superstar Julius Erving. The Lakers took a 3–2 lead, but Kareem Abdul-Jabbar could not play in Game 6 due to injury. Johnson, a natural point guard, was shifted to center, and ended up playing every position on the court during the game, scoring 42 points, while also attaining 15 rebounds and 7 assists to win his first championship while being awarded his first NBA Finals MVP; a remarkable performance {{in the annals of}} the sport.|$|E

5|$|Claims {{to three}} lode mines {{and a single}} coal mine were made within the Goat Rocks Wilderness, but the United States Bureau of Mines has no record of {{production}} from any of these claims. Historically, two claims have <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> staked in the area, the Mosquito lode near Walupt Lake in 1934, and later, the Glacier lode near Packwood Glacier in 1939. Neither show evidence of assessment work, and both deposits are now abandoned.

5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the breakout {{before the last}} stand—which various writers have posited might have <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele inDuna (leader) later claimed {{had been given to}} two unidentified men from Forbes's rear guard on 2 December, along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him. Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message, but the evidence against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned.|$|E
5|$|For L.A. Noire, the {{development}} team recreated 1940s Los Angeles by using aerial photographs taken by daredevil Robert Spence. In a career spanning over 50 years, Spence took over 110,000 aerial photographs of Los Angeles. The team used the photographs to create traffic patterns and public transport routes, {{as well as}} the location and condition of buildings. While striving to recreate an accurate model of 1947 Los Angeles, the team also took some artistic license, such as including the appearance of the film set for D. W. Griffith's Intolerance; the set had <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> dismantled in 1919.|$|E

5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court {{held that}} the federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims.

Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.|$|E
5|$|In the 2015 {{video game}} , {{which is the}} sequel to Batman: Arkham City, while under the {{influence}} of Scarecrow's latest toxin, Batman hallucinates the Joker's shooting of Barbara Gordon after she is kidnapped by the mysterious Arkham Knight, a hallucination of Joker noting that he merely got lucky when he shot Barbara as he was ignorant of her true ties to Batman, and also claimed that he had <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> aiming for Barbara's head. In addition, the DLC side story Batgirl: A Matter of Family had various similarities to the story of The Killing Joke, including Joker kidnapping and holding Police Commissioner Gordon hostage at a run-down amusement park as well as the backstory revealing that Joker had conned and murdered the original person who owned the park into granting him control.|$|E
