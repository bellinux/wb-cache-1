5|$|According to the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules, {{the use of}} {{the coat}} of arms is {{restricted}} to the government. Without explicit permission from the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA), no person or group is permitted to physically print, manufacture, display or sell anything depicting the coat of arms, or to allow such actions to happen. It is also forbidden to use any symbol that can be easily mistaken for the coat of arms. Persons who wish to use the coat of <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> literary work must also obtain prior permission from MICA. The only exception provided by the Rules is that the arms can be used by government officials and ministries on their building's exteriors and on printed documents.|$|E
5|$|By {{the later}} seventeenth century both the Presbyterian and Episcopalian {{wings of the}} church had adopted the {{modestly}} sized and plain form of churches that had emerged after the Reformation. Most had a centralised plan {{with two or three}} <b>arms,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rectangular or T-planned arrangement. Steeples continued to be a major feature, either centrally on the long axis, or on an end gable, as had been the case in pre-Reformation churches. As a result, there was little of the Baroque extravagance in church building seen on the continent and England. Some minor innovations may indicate a move back toward episcopacy in the Restoration era. Lauder Church was built by Bruce in 1673 for the Duke of Lauderdale, who championed the bishops in the reign of Charles II. The Gothic windows may have emphasised antiquity, but its basic Greek cross plan remained within the existing common framework of new churches.|$|E

5|$|Mulder and Bocks {{discover}} that Pfaster's mother had owned a car which matches paint found on Scully's abandoned car, tracking down her former residence. Meanwhile, Scully escapes from Pfaster {{as he prepares}} a cold bath for her, resulting in a pursuit through the house. Scully and Pfaster have a struggle that sends them falling down a staircase onto the foyer, where a task force led by Mulder and Bocks breaks in moments later and apprehends Pfaster. Scully initially insists that she is okay, but then breaks down and cries in Mulder's <b>arms.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> voice-over narration, Mulder traces Pfaster's pathology to his childhood, when {{he was raised in}} a family of four older sisters.

5|$|Taking {{place after}} the events of Mega Man 4, Mega Man's brother and ally Proto Man un{{character}}istically leads a group of menacing robots in {{attacks on the world}} and kidnaps his own creator Dr. Light, leaving the title character little choice but to take up <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fight against his once trusted sibling. Mega Man 5 carries over the same graphical style and action-platforming gameplay as the four preceding chapters in the series. The game introduces a new character, Beat, a robotic bird that the player can use as a weapon once a series of eight collectible letters are found. Artist Keiji Inafune had to re-illustrate the bosses several times but described his work as fun.|$|E

Seneb is depicted sitting cross-legged on a block of stone with his arms folded in a position characteristic of a scribe. His wife Senet sits alongside him, wearing a long robe with long sleeves and a wig covering her natural hair, which can be glimpsed on her forehead. She encircles him with her <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gesture of affection and support. She is shown with a slight smile on her face to signify her contentment and happiness.|$|E

5|$|The {{national}} emblem of Belarus, which replaced the historic Pahonia <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 1995 referendum, features a ribbon in the colours {{of the national}} flag, a map of Belarus, wheat ears and a red star. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the coat of arms of Belarus, although this is incorrect {{due to the lack of}} several heraldic elements. The emblem is an allusion to one that was used by the Belorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950, with the biggest change being a replacement of the hammer and sickle with an outline map of Belarus. Emblems reminiscent of the times of the Soviet Union are also used in Macedonia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and the region of Transnistria.|$|E
5|$|By {{the later}} seventeenth century both the Presbyterian and episcopalian {{wings of the}} church had adopted the {{modestly}} sized and plain form of churches that had emerged after the Reformation. Most had a centralised plan {{with two or three}} <b>arms,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rectangular or T-planned arrangement. Steeples continued to be a major feature, either centrally on the long axis, or on an end gable, in as had been the case in pre-Reformation churches. As a result, there was little of the baroque extravagance in church building seen on the Continent and England. Some minor innovations may indicate a move back toward episcopacy in the Restoration era. Lauder Church was built by Sir William Bruce in 1673 for the Duke of Lauderdale, who championed the bishops in the reign of Charles II and the Gothic windows of which may have emphasised antiquity, but its basic Greek cross plan remained within the common framework of new churches. The drive to episcopalian forms of worship may have resulted in more linear patterns, including rectangular plans with the pulpit on the end opposite the entrance. The major exceptions to the standard pattern are in the work of James Smith, who had become a Jesuit in his youth. These included the rebuilding of Holyrood Abbey undertaken for James VII in 1687, which was outfitted in an elaborate style. In 1691 Smith designed the mausoleum of Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, in Greyfriars Kirkyard, a circular structure modelled on the Tempietto di San Pietro, designed by Donato Bramante (1444–1514). The Latin Cross form, increasingly popular in Counter Reformation Catholicism, was also used, as in Smith's Canongate Kirk (1688–90), but here it never saw episcopal service as the Presbyterian revolution of 1689–90 occurred before it was completed and the chancel was blocked up, making it, in effect, a T-plan.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to {{form that}} of Great Britain; this was {{reflected}} by impaling their <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single quarter. The {{claim to the}} French throne continued, albeit passively, until it was mooted by the French Revolution {{and the formation of}} the French First Republic in 1792. During the peace negotiations at the Conference of Lille, from July to November 1797, the French delegates demanded that the King of Great Britain abandon the title of King of France as a condition of peace. The Acts of Union 1800 united the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Under King George III of the United Kingdom, a proclamation of 1 January 1801 set the royal style and titles and modified the Royal Arms, removing the French quarter and putting the arms of England, Scotland and Ireland on the same structural level, with the dynastic arms of Hanover moved to an inescutcheon.|$|E

25|$|Zimbabwe's {{intervention}} in the Mozambican Civil War, which culminated in the deployment of 1,000 troops into Tete Province {{towards the end of}} 1982, finally provided the impetuous for the establishment of ZDI. A state parastatal which could procure <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> direct manner while circumventing the army's cumbersome tender process was perceived as necessary for the war effort. Colonel Ian Stansfield, former Quartermaster-General and chief of the ZNA's Procurement Office, was appointed to lead the new effort. Stansfield aimed to build on the once-vibrant defence industry generated by the Rhodesian Bush War. He thus contracted with the separate firms that had once manufactured armoured vehicles, munitions, and small arms during that conflict and offered them an inroad into the export market under the auspices of a united Zimbabwe Defence Industries.|$|E
25|$|North Korean People's Liberation Front {{has been}} called the most militant defectors' organization. They are {{preparing}} to cross the border to North Korea, and take <b>arms,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> case of an uprising against the North Korean government. However, the North Korean People's Liberation Front is not the only group of defectors or North Korean military members to have planned starting an armed insurgency against the North Korean government. An earlier attempt by defectors to start an armed fight against the North Korean state was stopped by South Korean and Chinese officials. Members of the North Korean People's Liberation Front often dress in camouflage uniforms, sunglasses and berets and carry plastic weapons in public rallies. The uniforms are similar to the ones used by South Korean special forces. The group has petitioned the South Korean government to allow them to form their own army division.|$|E
