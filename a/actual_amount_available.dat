40|$|From the Proceedings of the 1978 Meetings of the Arizona Section - American Water Resources Assn. and the Hydrology Section - Arizona Academy of Science - April 14 - 15, 1978, Flagstaff, ArizonaWith the {{objective}} of determining if sufficient water would be salvaged by a typical desert, urban-household from normally wasted sources associated with the lot and household to adequately irrigate a garden and orchard, a 2000 sq ft house on a typical one fifth acre lot in three cities having climates similar to Phoenix, Tucson, or Prescott, Arizona was hypothesized {{and the amount of}} water available for yard watering calculated, provided that (1) only rainfall was available, (2) rainfall-runoff from covered areas associated with or adjacent to the lot was salvaged (roof, street, alley etc.), (3) gray-water from the household was utilized, (4) a portion of the lot was waterproofed to concentrate the runoff on the untreated portion, and (5) various combinations of the above were utilized {{to increase the amount of}} available water. It is demonstrated that these sources could be used singly or in combination to obtain the required amount of water with the <b>actual</b> <b>amount</b> <b>available</b> depending upon the precipitation, runoff and runon areas, runoff efficiency of the contributing area, and the number of people in the household. A number of horticultural plants are suggested that should best fit such an irregular irrigation scheme...|$|E
50|$|The game {{universe}} was relatively large, with 4,000 planets in total, so exploration could be extremely time consuming, and the coordinate system could require {{something of a}} learning curve. And despite being on a five-year mission, the game clock would wind quickly during warp travel, drastically reducing the <b>actual</b> <b>amount</b> of time <b>available</b> to solve the game. Later versions of the game helped the user by providing a list of planets and the items they contained.|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{transmitted}} data in computer networks {{is expected to}} grow considerably in the next years, putting more and more pressure on the network infrastructures. In order to guarantee a good service, it becomes fundamental to use the network resources efficiently. Network Utility Maximization (NUM) provides a framework for distributed optimization of users' utilities when network resources are limited. Unfortunately, in the scenario where the <b>amount</b> of <b>available</b> resources is not known a priori classical NUM solving methods do not offer a viable solution. To overcome this limitation we design an overlay rate allocation scheme that attempts to infer the <b>actual</b> <b>amount</b> of <b>available</b> network resources while coordinating the users rate allocation. Due to the general and complex model assumed for the resource inference a passive learning of these resources would not lead to satisfying performance. The coordination scheme must perform active learning in order to speed up the resources estimation and quickly increase the delivered performances. By using an optimal learning formulation we are able to balance the tradeoff between an accurate estimation and an effective resources exploitation in order to maximize the long term performance delivered to the users...|$|R
50|$|In {{the course}} of his life's work in research, Herschbach has {{published}} over 400 scientific papers. Herschbach has applied his broad expertise in both the theory and practice of chemistry and physics to diverse problems in chemical physics, including theoretical work on dimensional scaling. One of his studies demonstrated that methane is in fact spontaneously formed at high pressure and high temperature environments such as those deep in the Earth's mantle; this finding is an exciting indication of abiogenic hydrocarbon formation, meaning that the <b>actual</b> <b>amount</b> of hydrocarbons <b>available</b> on earth might be much larger than conventionally assumed under the assumption that all hydrocarbons are fossil fuels. His recent work also includes a collaboration with Steven Brams studying approval voting.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} cooking {{utensils}} {{on the total}} and bioavailable iron contents of five green leafy vegetables, along with related promoters and inhibitors, were investigated. The cooked and fresh greens were analysed for moisture, total and bioavailable iron, ascorbic acid. dietary fibre, tannins, total oxalates and soluble oxalates by standard techniques. Moisture content of fresh greens ranged from 80 - 90 %, total dietary fibre (5 - 11 g/ 100 g), oxalates (0. 022 - 1. 37 g/ 100 g) and tannin (41 - 166 mg/ 100 g). Cooking in different utensils {{had no effect on}} these parameters. Ascorbic acid content ranged from 8. 7 to 88. 3 mg/ 100 g in fresh greens and was reduced by 18 - 64 % on cooking. The total and ionisable iron contents of greens ranged from 3 to 13 mg/ 100 g and 0. 43 to 2. 7 mg/ 100 g, respectively, and increased on cooking in iron utensil to 9. 7 to 17. 5 mg/ 100 g and 1. 50 to 8. 56 mg/ 100 g, respectively. The availability of iron, in relation to total iron, of greens cooked in iron utensils was either comparable or marginally higher than those cooked in other metallic utensils. Since the total iron content of greens cooked in iron utensils was high, the <b>actual</b> <b>amount</b> of <b>available</b> iron also increased. It can be concluded that cooking in iron utensils increases the total as well as the available iron content of greens. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} legumes to supply {{nitrogen}} to succeeding crops {{has been recognized}} for many years. The <b>actual</b> <b>amount</b> of N <b>available</b> {{will depend on the}} amount of N in the alfalfa and its availability, and any additional soil N that may be released due to the growth of the legume. From a practical standpoint, farmers need to know how much nitrogen fertilizer they should apply when the crop is grown following the legume. This approach, commonly called the nitrogen fertilizer replacement value, integrates the N directly made available from the legume with the nitrogen provided from other sources, such as the stimulation of easily released soil N, into a single value. For legumes to be considered effective N sources for succeeding corps, they must release the legume N in a sufficiently timely manner to fill the demand. If the mineral N is released too early, it can potentially be lost to leaching and/or denitrification. If released too late, it will not benefit the crop, and poses a potential threat to groundwater quality via leaching. This may be a particular problem for winter wheat if the wheat is planted soon after the alfalfa is killed or if the wheat is no-till planted (Kelling et al., 2000). The synchrony of nitrogen released from legumes with crop demand for N has been a concern even with crops such as corn, where N uptake can occur throughout the summer (Stute and Posner, 1995) ...|$|R
40|$|Animal manure is {{of vital}} {{importance}} to soil-fertility maintenance in semi-arid West Africa {{due to its}} intrinsic value as a soil amendment {{and because of the}} low level of inorganic fertiliser use. This paper provides a regional overview of manure utilisation for food crop production. Results of experimental trials and on-farm studies are reviewed to evaluate the agronomic and economic effectiveness of livestock manure as a source of nutrients for millet and sorghum production. The potential and <b>actual</b> <b>amounts</b> of manure <b>available</b> for crop production during normal rainfall years are estimated, and the effect of drought-induced changes in livestock population and species composition on manure availability and cropland productivity are assessed. In doing this, on-station and on-farm data from Niger are used to assess nutrient losses from croplands and to estimate the amount of manure required to maintain crop production at various yield levels. The number of animals needed to produce this level of manure and the feed resources required to maintain them are estimated and compared with the level of livestock holdings and feeds found in village studies. The influence of drought on the structure of national and village herds are evaluated and the amounts of different types of manure that are likely to be available in the years immediately preceding and following a drought are estimated. These estimates and feed availability parameters are used to assess the adequacy of available manure for food crop production, and the role that manure and other soil amendments can play in the future intensification of agricultural production in semi-arid West Africa...|$|R
