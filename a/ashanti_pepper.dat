5000|$|Piper guineense is a West African {{species of}} Piper; the spice derived from its dried fruit {{is known as}} West African pepper, <b>Ashanti</b> <b>pepper,</b> Benin pepper, false cubeb, Guinea cubeb, uziza pepper or (ambiguously) [...] "Guinea pepper", and called locally kale, kukauabe, masoro, sasema and soro wisa. It is a close {{relative}} of cubeb pepper and a relative of black pepper and long pepper. Unlike cubeb pepper, which is large and spherical in shape, Ashanti peppers are prolate spheroids, smaller and smoother than Cubeb pepper in appearance and generally bear a reddish tinge. The stalks of <b>Ashanti</b> <b>pepper</b> berries are also distinctly curved whilst those of cubeb pepper are completely straight.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} flavour, <b>Ashanti</b> <b>pepper</b> {{is very similar}} to cubeb pepper but is much less bitter and has a fresher more {{herbaceous}} flavour. Though known in Europe during the Middle Ages (it was a common spice in Rouen and Dieppe in 14th Century France), these days, its use is marginalized to West and Central Africa.|$|E
50|$|The {{plants that}} provide <b>Ashanti</b> <b>pepper</b> are vines that can {{grow up to}} 20m in length, {{climbing}} up boles of trees by means of adventitious roots. These are native to topical regions of Central and Western Africa and are semi-cultivated {{in countries such as}} Nigeria where the leaves, known as uziza, are used as a flavouring for stews. Like other members of the pepper family, Ashanti peppers contain 5-8% of the chemical piperine which gives them their hot taste. They contain large amounts of beta-caryophyllene, which is being investigated as an anti-inflammatory agent. They also contain significant proportions (10%) of myristicin, elemicin, safrole and dillapiol.|$|E
50|$|Research {{shows that}} <b>Ashanti</b> <b>peppers</b> have {{preservative}} and anti-oxidant properties. In a comparison study of three native West African peppers on {{the preservation of}} catfish, <b>Ashanti</b> <b>peppers</b> were discovered {{to be the most}} effective.|$|R
50|$|It {{is used in}} West African cuisine {{where it}} imparts heat and a pungent aroma to classic West African stews. Even in West Africa, <b>Ashanti</b> <b>pepper</b> is an {{expensive}} spice and is used sparingly. Often, a few grains are in a pestle and mortar before being added (along with black pepper) to soups or to boiled rice. The spice can also be substituted in any recipe using cubeb pepper, where Ashanti imparts a less bitter flavour. The pepper is also sometimes one of the ingredients in the Berbere spice mix used in the cuisines of Ethiopia and of Eritrea. However, West African Pepper is a highly esteemed spice in its region of origin and {{may be hard to}} get abroad; thus, long pepper is more often used in Berbere.|$|E
5000|$|The term Uziza {{refers to}} the dried fruit of the West African {{deciduous}} shrub Zanthoxylum tessmannii, syn. Fagara tessmannii, {{a member of the}} 'prickly ash' Zanthoxylum family. The name of the spice is derived from Igbo, a language in Nigeria, where the spice is grown and harvested on a commercial basis. Zanthoxylum tessmannii is a close relative of the Sichuan pepper, and Uziza has a similar taste profile to the Asian spice. However, unlike Sichuan pepper where only the pericarp of the fruit is used, uziza is used whole (both pericarp and seed). This may explain why uziza has a spicier flavour and greater pungency than sichuan pepper. However, Cary Cairncross of Raw Decadence South Africa (http://www.spiceclub.co.za/) writes (personal communication): [...] "I have an Igbo tribe supplier from Nigeria and he disagrees and says it is a local name for <b>ashanti</b> <b>pepper</b> (piper guineense)".|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} of the volatile oil from the fruits (berries) of <b>Ashanti</b> <b>pepper</b> (Piper guineense) was investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques. Out of 29 peaks (representing 99. 2 % of total oil), 27 components were identified representing 96. 40 % of the total oil composition. The major components were (1 s) -(- 1) -Î²-pinene (43. 9 %), D-Limonene (7. 7 %), caryophyllene (6. 9 %), car- 2 -ene (5. 4 %) and 1, 6, 10 -dodecetrien-z-ol, 3, 7, 11 -trimetyl (2. 9 %). The oil was also screened for its antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Serratia, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It was found out that it exhibited no activity against any of these organisms...|$|E
