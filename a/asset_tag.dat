Drew's first Windows XP implementation did not register student computers into an Active Directory domain, instead opting for an unmanaged local account, which caused many support issues. By contract, having the computers in the domain would mean that users would not need a separate password to log in locally. eXtreme Deployment was developed during the summer of 2003. Preloaded on the notebooks by the vendor, and built on opensource technologies, it identifies computers by their BIOS <b>asset</b> <b>tag</b> information and walks students through the process of joining the domain, and customizing settings for the user. With this, Drew is able to provide just-in-time personalization of student computers, without needing to pre-allocate them to specific students.

This system include: Design Implementation of a reader device that uses RFID technology to read the information of the <b>asset’s</b> <b>tag.</b> Use Ethernet network to transmit the data collected by the reader to the server. Being able to effectively and efficiently locate assets is essential for many entities (e. g. hospitals, manufacturing floors and warehouses). In order to utilize limited budget and resources efficiently, accurate locating or tracking is required in many fields. In this thesis, we will focus on how to locate an item using RFID in real time indoor tracking mechanism. The purpose of using RFID is to minimize the searching time, effort, and cost. Electronic tag is attached for each asset, where It’s information is pre-inserted into the system through user interface. The tag reader is composed of RFID sensor, microcontroller, and serial-to-Ethernet chip. The RFID sensor reads the serial number of the tag, within the given range, through radio waves then it passes the data serially to the MCU, which will transmit it through SPI to the serial-to-Ethernet chip.

Each OLMC may be set to output as inverting or non-inverting, and be placed into either registered or combinatorial mode. In registered mode, each macrocell actively uses a D-flip-flop to hold a state under control of the data input from the logic portion of the macrocell and the rising edge of the clock signal, while in combinatorial mode the flip-flop {{is removed from the}} macrocell and the outputs are driven directly by the logic.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) depends on effective containment and surveillance (C/S) technologies and methods for maintaining continuity of knowledge over nuclear <b>assets.</b> <b>Tags</b> and seals, a subset of C/S technologies, are an area where innovation has been relatively stagnant for the past fifteen years. It is necessary to investigate technologies not previously used in this field in order to defend against emerging threats and methods of defeat. Based on a gap analysis of tags and seals currently being used by the IAEA, completed with the input of several subject matter experts, the technology selected for investigation was ion-exchanged glass. Ion-exchanged glass is relatively inexpensive, has high strength, and {{can be used in a}} variety of applications. If identical pieces of glass are exchanged under the same conditions and subjected to the same point load, the fracture patterns produced can be compared and used as a verification measure. This technology has the potential to be used in passive seal applications. Each image was categorized depending on its fracture as a " 3 leaf" or " 4 leaf" pattern. These two populations were separately analyzed and evaluated. Several methods used to analyze the fracture patterns involve the use of image analysis software such as ImageJ and the MATLAB Control Point Selection Tool. The statistical analysis software Minitab was used to validate the use of facture pattern analysis as verification tool. The analysis yielded a 60 % verified comparison for samples demonstrating a " 3 leaf" fracture pattern and a 78 % verified comparison for samples with a " 4 leaf" fracture pattern.

Prior research has mainly focused on the prevention of unauthorized tracking by clandestine scanning at the physical level. However, the higher system level of unauthorized tracking has not been well recognized, where an adversary tracks movement of RFID <b>tagged</b> <b>assets</b> by eavesdropping network messages or compromising data center servers. Compared to unauthorized tracking at the physical level, unauthorized tracking at the system level could be even more harmful as the adversary is able to obtain tracking information on a global scale and without physical presence. This paper analyzes the threat of unauthorized tracking by a semi-trusted RFID Discovery Service which maintains a database of RFID tag location records in the current industrial standard EPCglobal Network. We propose an anti-tracking design to mitigate this threat. Our design protects against reading attack to Discovery Service database and provides efficient key management and access control for dynamic supply chain systems. The design is backward compatible with the existing communication protocols as well as the database schemas of standard RFID Discovery Service, which makes it feasible to deploy in real world applications...|$|R

40|$|Real-Time Locating Systems (RTLS) {{belong to}} a class of {{locating}} systems capable of remotely determining the location of <b>tagged</b> <b>assets</b> in an environment within {{a relatively short time}} frame (real-time). Signals from tags are received wirelessly by readers, which use information about the signal, to continuously determine the location of the tag relative to each reader. Using readers positioned at several locations around a tag offers multiple location readings, which can be compiled together at a central host to estimate the location of a tag in a two or three dimensional space. Location information from several vantage points also reduces the chance of false location estimates of a tag when one or more readers' location estimates contain some error. Indoor asset tracking is a unique specialty of many types of RTLS, as Global Positioning Systems (GPS) have difficulty providing asset locations within buildings. RTLS deployments generally address the problems of determining the location of equipment and products in a warehouse or even tracking employees and files in an office. The most common RTLS uses a Wi-Fi infrastructure to determine the location of <b>tagged</b> <b>assets.</b> These systems employ Time-of-Arrival (ToA) or Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) techniques to wirelessly determine asset location. Scaling up a system that uses a Wi-Fi infrastructure to localize large numbers of tags introduces a significant wireless traffic burden, reducing data throughput for other users of the same Wi-Fi network. Both ToA and RSSI methods of localization suffer from significant inaccuracies in reported location of assets and often are unable to determine which room an asset resides. This thesis presents a new method for determining asset location that offers better accuracy than systems using ToA and RSSI techniques, and an RTLS that uses existing Wi-Fi infrastructures and commercial off-the-shelf parts (COTS) without placing excessive need on the Wi-Fi networks...|$|R

There are, however, domains in which UAVs may help to increase the safety of airplanes and the management of flights and airport resources that often require substantial human resources. For instance, Paris Charles de Gaulle airport (CDG) has more than 7, 000 staff and supports 30, 000 direct jobs for more than 60 million passengers per year (as of 2016). Indeed, these new systems can be used beneficially for several purposes, even in sensitive areas like airports. Among the considered applications are those that suggest using UAVs to enhance safety of on-ground airplanes; for instance, by collecting (once the aircraft has landed) data recorded by different systems during the flight (like the sensors of the Aircraft Data Networks - ADN) or by examining the state of airplane structure. In this paper, our proposal is to use UAVs, {{under the control of}} the airport authorities, to inventory and track various <b>tagged</b> <b>assets,</b> such as luggage, supplies required for the flights, and maintenance tools. The aim of our proposal is to make airport management systems more efficient for operations requiring inventory and tracking, along with increasing safety (sensitive assets such as refueling tanks, or sensitive pieces of luggage can be tracked), thus raising financial profi...|$|R
