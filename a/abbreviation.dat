40|$|Abstract. In many languages, <b>abbreviations</b> {{are widely}} used either in writing or talking. However, <b>abbreviations</b> {{are likely to be}} ambiguous. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} disambiguation. That is, <b>abbreviations</b> should be {{expanded}} correctly. Disambiguation of <b>abbreviations</b> is critical for correct understanding not only for the <b>abbreviations</b> themselves but also for the whole text. Little research has been done concerning disambiguation of <b>abbreviations</b> for documents in English and Latin. Nothing has been done for the Hebrew language. In this ongoing work, we investigate a basic model, which expands <b>abbreviations</b> contained in Jewish Law Documents written in Hebrew. This model has been implemented in a prototype system. Currently, experimental results show that <b>abbreviations</b> are expanded correctly in a rate of almost 60 %. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{exploding}} {{growth of}} the biomedical literature presents many challenges for biological researchers. One such challenge is {{from the use of}} a great deal of <b>abbreviations.</b> Extracting <b>abbreviations</b> and their definitions accurately is very helpful to biologists and also facilitates biomedical text analysis. Existing approaches fall into four broad categories: rule based, machine learning based, text alignment based and statistically based. State of the art methods either focus exclusively on acronym-type <b>abbreviations,</b> or could not recognize rare <b>abbreviations.</b> We propose a systematic method to extract <b>abbreviations</b> effectively. At first a scoring method is used to classify the <b>abbreviations</b> into acronym-type and non-acronym-type <b>abbreviations,</b> and then their corresponding definitions are identified by two different methods: text alignment algorithm for the former, statistical method for the latter. Results A literature mining system MBA was constructed to extract both acronym-type and non-acronym-type <b>abbreviations.</b> An abbreviation-tagged literature corpus, called Medstract gold standard corpus, was used to evaluate the system. MBA achieved a recall of 88 % at the precision of 91 % on the Medstract gold-standard EVALUATION Corpus. Conclusion We present a new literature mining system MBA for extracting biomedical <b>abbreviations.</b> Our evaluation demonstrates that the MBA system performs better than the others. It can identify the definition of not only acronym-type <b>abbreviations</b> including a little irregular acronym-type <b>abbreviations</b> (e. g.,), but also non-acronym-type <b>abbreviations</b> (e. g.,). </p...|$|R

5|$|UBS AG is a Swiss global {{financial}} services company, incorporated in the Canton of Zurich, and co-headquartered in Zürich and Basel.

In Switzerland, these services are also offered to retail clients. The name UBS was originally an <b>abbreviation</b> for the Union Bank of Switzerland, but it ceased to be a representational <b>abbreviation</b> after the bank's merger with the Swiss Bank Corporation in 1998. The company traces its origins to 1856, when the earliest of its predecessor banks was founded.|$|E

40|$|Biomedical <b>abbreviations</b> and {{acronyms}} {{are widely}} used in biomedical literature. Since many <b>abbreviations</b> represent important content in biomedical literature, information retrieval and extraction benefits from identifying the meanings of biomedical <b>abbreviations.</b> Since many <b>abbreviations</b> are ambiguous, {{it would be important}} to map <b>abbreviations</b> to their full forms, which ultimately represent the meanings of the <b>abbreviations.</b> In this study, we present a novel unsupervised method that applies MEDLINE records as a knowledge source for disambiguating <b>abbreviations</b> in full-text biomedical journal articles. We first automatically generated from MEDLINE records a knowledge source or dictionary of abbreviation-full pairs. We then trained on MEDLINE records and predicted the full forms of <b>abbreviations</b> in full-text journal articles by applying supervised machine-learning algorithms in an unsupervised fashion.
