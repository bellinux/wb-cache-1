2500|$|Vacuum-tube {{amplifiers}} (also {{known as}} tube amplifiers or valve amplifiers) use a vacuum tube as the <b>active</b> <b>device.</b> While semiconductor amplifiers have largely displaced valve amplifiers for low-power applications, valve amplifiers {{can be much}} more cost effective in high power applications such as radar, countermeasures equipment, and communications equipment. Many microwave amplifiers are specially designed valve amplifiers, such as the klystron, gyrotron, traveling wave tube, and crossed-field amplifier, and these microwave valves provide much greater single-device power output at microwave frequencies than solid-state devices. Vacuum tubes remain in use in some high end audio equipment, {{as well as in}} musical instrument amplifiers, due to a preference for [...] "tube sound".|$|E

Both passive and <b>active</b> <b>devices</b> require that the user wear the device. Installed systems can be expensive and difficult to deploy.|$|R
40|$|Through Silicon vias (TSVs) {{are a key}} {{breakthrough}} in 3 D technology to shorten global interconnects and enable the heterogeneous integration. However, TSVs also introduce {{an important source of}} noise coupling arising from electrical coupling between TSVs and the <b>active</b> <b>devices.</b> This paper investigates the TSV noise coupling to <b>active</b> <b>devices</b> including both FinFETs and planar transistors based on two-port S-parameter measurements up to 40 GHz. The measurements clearly show that nFinFETs have better noise coupling immunity than planar nNMOSFETs. The dominant coupling mechanisms were also identified for both types of <b>active</b> <b>devices.</b> Moreover, calibrated TCAD models were developed. We show that via-last TSV architectures with thick liners (“donut TSVs”) and scaled TSV diameters reduce the noise coupling to <b>active</b> <b>devices.</b> Finally, both coupling and stress induced saturation current variations as a function of TSV to <b>active</b> <b>devices</b> distance were investigated. This allows us to propose a novel model for the TSV Keep Out Zone (KOZ) including electromagnetic coupling effects...|$|R
