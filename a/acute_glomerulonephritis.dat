5000|$|Goodpasture {{was born}} in Clarksville, Tennessee, in 1886. He {{received}} his B.A. from Vanderbilt University in 1908. In 1912, Goodpasture graduated from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine with an M.D. degree. There, under professors William H. Welch and George H. Whipple, he was subsequently appointed a Rockefeller Fellow in pathology; he held this position from 1912 to 1915. Thereafter, Goodpasture joined the faculty of Harvard Medical School, as an attending pathologist at the Penter Bent Brigham Hospital and assistant professor of pathology in Boston. During that time, Goodpasture took a two-year leave of absence to serve during World War I as a medical officer in the United States Navy. In 1919, he undertook a pathological study of the then-ongoing influenza pandemic. In doing so, he identified a patient whose infection {{was followed by a}} peculiar illness that featured hemoptysis and <b>acute</b> <b>glomerulonephritis.</b> [...] That condition, now known as Goodpasture syndrome, is currently recognized as an immunologically mediated disease caused by autoantibodies that bind to pulmonary-alveolar, as well as glomerular-capillary, basement membranes. After leaving Harvard in 1921, Goodpasture worked at the University of the Philippines College of Medicine in Manila. From 1922 to 1924, he was the director of William H. Singer Memorial Laboratories, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1924, Goodpasture was invited to return to Vanderbilt as professor and chairman of the Department of Pathology, the School of Medicine having been recently reorganized. He accepted, and held that position until 1955. Goodpasture also was the Dean of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine from 1945 to 1950. After retirement from the latter institution in 1955, he was invited to serve as director of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) in Washington, D.C. He did so through 1959, helping to reorganize and expand the institute's scientific mission.|$|E

We studied the mechanism of hyperkalemia (5. 7 to 6. 7 mmol/liter) in four men with post-infectious glomerulonephritis. All four patients had clinical findings consistent with <b>acute</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> (edema, hypertension, proteinuria, hematuria, and an elevated ASO titer) and a renal biopsy performed in three of the patients confirmed the diagnosis. In comparison to normal subjects (N = 18), plasma aldosterone (5. 4 ± 1. 6 vs. 22. 8 ± 2. 6 ng/dl, P < 0. 005) and plasma renin activity (0. 3 ± 0. 2 vs. 4. 3 ± 0. 6 ng/ml/hr, P < 0. 005) were reduced.

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} levels of Cys C, BUN and sCr in {{patients}} of early renal damage of <b>acute</b> <b>glomerulonephritis.</b> Methods: A total of 90 cases with <b>acute</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> treated in Nephrology Department of our hospital from May 2013 to May 2015 were randomly selected, among whom 32 cases of AKI 1 stage (A group), 28 cases of AKI 2 stage (B group) and 30 cases of AKI 3 stage (C group), and 35 cases of healthy volunteers receiving routine physical examination in our hospital {{during the same period}} were selected as control group. Cystatin C (Cys C), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (sCr) were detected, and acute physiology and chronic health status score (APACHE Ⅱscoring) was conducted in all research subjects. The correlation of APACHE Ⅱ scores with Cys C, BUN and sCr levels was analyzed respectively. Results: The differences in Cys C, BUN and sCr levels and APACHE Ⅱ scores among groups were statistically significant (P= 0. 000); there was significant positive correlation between APACHE Ⅱ scores and levels of Cys C, BUN and sCr of three groups of patients with <b>acute</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> (r> 0. 00), and the differences were statistically significant (P< 0. 05); in the diagnosis of early renal damage in patients with <b>acute</b> <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> the areas of Cys C, BUN and sCr under ROC curve were 0. 946, 0. 832 and 0. 896, respectively.

MethodsTo further explore the possible role of SPEB in APSGN, we performed ELISA studies to detect anti-SPEB antibodies in the sera of patients with APSGN, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), scarlet fever (SF) and normal children. Using ELISA, anti-SPEB titers on acute and convalescent APSGN sera were measured to determine immunity to APSGN. We also performed immunofluorescence studies on APSGN and non-APSGN kidney biopsies to probe for the presence and localization of SPEB. ResultsOur data show that anti-SPEB antibodies are present in APSGN sera and antibody titers are significantly higher than in ARF, SF and normal sera. Anti-SPEB titers tend to rise acutely and decrease with time but do not reach baseline after one year. When kidney biopsies were probed with rabbit anti-SPEB antibody, 12 of 18 (67 %) of the APSGN cases were positive while only 4 of 25 (16 %) of the non-APSGN cases were positive.
