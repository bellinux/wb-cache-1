He continued collecting Serbian epic poetry, which {{he started in}} his youth, and in 1863 he spent the holidays in Mostar, listening to the epic poets gathered around the newly built orthodox church. As early as 1866, he conducted in all the regions of the Balkans a sociological inquiry with many questions concerning the forms of landed property in the country, social structureof the village, customs, institutions and family community, etc. Using the data, he particularly worked out in detail the problem of direct observation, the comparative methods, the volume of use of statistics and the <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents.</b> In 1867 he issued a book [...] "Pravni običaji kod Slovena" [...] (Legal customs of the Slavs). He mainly based his work on written sources, but he already started questioning his friends about the legal reasoning {{of the people in}} their regions. In 1872 he published a book [...] "Pisani zakoni na Slovenskom Jugu" [...] (Legal Status in the Slavic South). The idea was for this book to be an introduction to the serial, which was supposed to grasp written antic legal sources from the Slavic South.|$|E
5000|$|The Christian Church in Italy has {{significant}} similarities with the Biblical Unitarian movement, although it maintains a cautious position on some doctrinal points. Wilbur wrote about this: [...] "The religious movement whose history we are endeavoring to trace...became fully developed in thought and polity in only four countries, one after another, namely Poland, Transylvania, England and America. But {{in each of}} these it showed, along with certain individual characteristics, a general spirit, a common point of view, and a doctrinal pattern that tempt one to regard them as all outgrowths of a single movement which passed from one to another; for nothing could be more natural than to presume that these common features implied a common ancestry. Yet such is not the fact, for {{in each of these}} four lands the movement, instead of having originated elsewhere, and been translated only after attaining mature growth, appears to have sprung independently and directly from its own native roots, and to have been influenced by other and similar movements only after it had already developed an independent life and character of its own.". From the <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> that you can find on the official site of the CCI, {{it is clear that the}} doctrinal position of this Christian confession of faith is therefore akin to the so-called Biblical Unitarian movement [...] and on the other hand, far from that of Unitarian Universalist Association who, although they have the same origin in 1500 AD, through the centuries, have suffered the influence of many non-biblical ideas (cf. Universalism).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a minimally immersive threedimensional volumetric interactive information visualization system for management and <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>document</b> corpora. The system, SFA, uses glyph-based volume rendering, enabling more complex data relationships and information attributes to be visualized than traditional 2 D and surface-based visualization systems. Two-handed interaction using three-space magnetic trackers and stereoscopic viewing are combined {{to produce a}} minimally immersive interactive system that enhances the user's three-dimensional perception of the information space. This new system capitalizes on the human visual system's preattentive learning capabilities to quickly analyze the displayed information.
