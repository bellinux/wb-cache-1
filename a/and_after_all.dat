25|$|From 1933 to 1935, a {{concentration}} camp primarily for political opponents of the regime was established on the Kuhberg, one of the hills surrounding Ulm. The Jews of Ulm, around 500 people, were first discriminated against and later persecuted; their synagogue was torn down after Kristallnacht in November 1938. The sole RAF strategic bombing during World War II against Ulm occurred on December 17, 1944, against the two large lorry factories of Magirus-Deutz and Kässbohrer, {{as well as other}} industries, barracks, and depots in Ulm. The Gallwitz Barracks and several military hospitals were among 14 Wehrmacht establishments destroyed. The raid killed 707 Ulm inhabitants and left 25,000 homeless <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> the bombings, over 80% of the medieval city centre lay in ruins.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, {{the village}} of Two Harbors decided it needed a high school. On February 12, 1902, Two Harbors Central High School was {{dedicated}} at a total cost of $35,025. This school was on the 400 block of Fourth Avenue. It had fifty students and three teachers. The first of these students to graduate were Mary Rylander and Ann Paulson. The school taught arithmetic, grammar, and American History. Very little English was taught at the time. In 1903 Latin and music were introduced. Courses in science and sewing were added in 1906. Manual training and domestic services were not introduced until 1908. By 1909 the school had almost doubled with ninety-eight students and seven teachers. By 1910 the school library had seven thousand books. Plans for a new building were announced in 1935, at an estimated $100,000. The original Central High School was demolished and the new building was completed in 1939. At completion, <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> additions were made, the total cost was $585,000. A referendum for a new building to be located two miles (3km) north of town on Lake County Highway 2 (CR 2) was passed in 2003. Building was completed and classes began in 2005. Students use the hiking trails in the woods, around ponds, and the football field. The former high school on 4th Avenue was demolished in 2008.|$|E

500|$|On 31 August, {{the company}} group was ordered to move to South Cerney in Gloucestershire, under the cover story that they were {{conducting}} a [...] "readiness to move" [...] exercise. It was only at this point, <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> mobile telephones had been confiscated to ensure operational security, that the entire company was briefed on the operation that was being planned. With the operation becoming {{more likely to be}} launched, Lowe and his planning group flew to Dakar, Senegal, on 3 September to continue planning and to study intelligence gathered from SAS patrols operating near the West Side Boys' camp. The British government feared that deployment of forces to Sierra Leone might precipitate an adverse reaction by the West Side Boys against the captive soldiers. They calculated that it would take 14 hours to launch an assault from the United Kingdom should it be required in an emergency, so the remainder of {{the company group}} was also moved to Dakar {{in order to reduce the}} response time. In order to further reduce the response time, political authority to launch the assault in an emergency was delegated to the British High Commissioner in Freetown, Alan Jones, while the military decision was delegated to Brigadier David Richards, commander of British forces in Sierra Leone. Two days later, a pair of SAS observation teams (one on each side of Rokel Creek) were inserted near the villages by assault boats manned by the Special Boat Service (SBS)—the Royal Navy's special forces unit. They began monitoring the West Side Boys' movements and gathering intelligence, such as details of weapons, as well as identifying viable landing sites for helicopters.|$|E
