25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{will have}} no threats; <b>you</b> are powerless, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> very <b>well</b> <b>know.</b> Let things remain as they are or, by God! you shall both suffer for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am no skilled electrician, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> very <b>well</b> <b>know.</b> My calling <b>you</b> {{here was}} an accident. So I don't know how to command you, nor what {{to ask you to}} do." ...|$|R

6000|$|To show one's tongue, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> [...] Is not {{considered}} nice to do; [...] But {{if it were}} like Mr. Toad's [...] I'd want to show it--wouldn't you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't {{your health}} I mean. There are other things, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know.</b> You do your day's {{work and you}} take your pleasure, and you go through both as if your feet were on a treadmill." ...|$|E
60|$|STRAMMFEST. It {{is quite}} simple, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> very <b>well</b> <b>know.</b> A dozen {{travellers}} {{arrive at the}} boundary. The official collects their passports. He counts twelve persons; then counts the passports. If there are twelve, he is satisfied.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Sir Lamorack, [...] "so be it <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will, though I am {{very much}} {{surprised}} {{that you should}} do battle against me, after all that hath passed betwixt us. More especially at this season when, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> very <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> I am weary and winded with battle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} say {{something}} to her, or otherwise it will be strange; and even to him I would say a word or two,--a word in kindness, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> so <b>well</b> <b>know</b> how. It {{will be easier to}} him in that way, than if you were to be altogether silent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That, unfortunately," [...] de Grost declared, with {{a little}} sigh, [...] "is, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> out of the question. You are too clever for me, Bernadine. After all, I shall {{have to go back}} to my farm." ...|$|E

50|$|Oh, {{you mind}} ! {{why do you}} always steeped in thoughts. Do not engage {{yourself}} in the duality of thoughts. Give up this duality. I ask you to listen to the inner voice of God in you.

6000|$|... "No," [...] replied he, {{with sudden}} consciousness, [...] "not {{to find it}} in YOU; for I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe it all.--I feel it--I would express it if I could--but, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> I am no orator." ...|$|E

5000|$|Collins, by then a Vice Admiral, {{wrote to}} Burnett's elder son, Patrick, saying: [...] "Joe Burnett {{was one of}} our finest officers.

6000|$|... "And {{you really}} have the effrontery to tell me this," [...] said she; [...] "to tell me, who, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> very <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> set {{up to be a}} beauty myself, and who am at this very moment taking such an {{interest}} in your affairs, {{you really have}} the effrontery to tell me that Mrs. Bold is the most beautiful woman you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This day," [...] {{said one}} of the party, in a tone of authority, [...] "did Don Christopher sail from Cadiz; the sovereigns deeming Palos too small a port for the {{equipment}} of so great an enterprise. You may depend on what I tell ye, good neighbors; my husband, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> all <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> holding an appointment in the admiral's own ship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, dear lady, that is {{not soon}} done! You and Mistress Anne, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> first awoke me from my firm belief that I {{was none other than}} an elf, and yet there have since been times when I have doubted whether it were not indeed the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From {{the very}} {{circumstance}} of its being larger, sir. We shall have no occasion {{to open the}} windows at all--not once the whole evening; {{and it is that}} dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon heated bodies, which (<b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> sir) does the mischief." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon me, sir; you {{are giving}} a very wrong {{construction}} to my language, if you suppose I include, without many and particular qualifications, the bibulus Americanus, {{in the family}} of the vacca.

6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] said McMurdo sternly. [...] "It {{was only}} last night, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>well,</b> that I swore good faith to our Bodymaster. Would you be {{asking me to}} break my oath?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want my days to be long, if we're {{never to}} come to an understanding," [...] she answered. [...] "And I've got no mother, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>well,</b> or <b>you</b> wouldn't treat me so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not. No {{power on}} earth would have bribed you to do it, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>well</b> enough. I don't mind the first night, but we are too old {{for that sort of}} thing now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Patrick is {{not only}} a very clever and a very {{agreeable}} man," [...] Lady Holchester resumes a little maliciously; [...] "he is also, in all his habits and ways (<b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know),</b> a man younger than his years--who still possesses many of the qualities which seldom fail to attract women." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon me," [...] {{rejoined the}} Intelligencer, calmly, [...] "you ask what is beyond my duty. This pearl, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> is held upon a {{peculiar}} tenure; and having once let it escape from your keeping, {{you have no}} greater claim to it--nay, not so great--as any other person. I cannot give it back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is, altogether, a most {{extraordinary}} procedure, John," [...] he at length observed, [...] "and, it strikes me, {{that it is}} but an indifferent reward for the liberality with which I have permitted others to use my property, these thirty years; often, very often, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> to my own discomfort, and to that of my friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And these {{but as a}} kind of quit-rent, to [...] Assert {{my right}} as Lord: and even had [...] I such an inclination,'twere (<b>as</b> <b>you</b> [...] <b>Well</b> <b>know)</b> superfluous; they are grown so bad, [...] That Hell has nothing better left to do [...] Than leave them to themselves: so much more mad [...] And evil by their own {{internal}} curse, [...] Heaven cannot make them better, nor I worse.|$|R
60|$|O'FLAHERTY [idyllically]. What a discontented sort of {{an animal}} a man is, sir! Only a month ago, I was in the quiet of the country out at the front, with not a sound except {{the birds and the}} bellow of a cow in the {{distance}} as it might be, and the shrapnel making little clouds in the heavens, and the shells whistling, and maybe a yell or two when one of us was hit; and would you believe it, sir, I complained of the noise and wanted to have a peaceful hour at home. Well: them two has taught me a lesson. This morning, sir, when I was telling the boys here how I was longing to be back taking my part for king and country with the others, I was lying, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> <b>knew,</b> sir. Now I can go and say it with a clear conscience. Some likes war's alarums; and some likes home life. I've tried both, sir; and I'm for war's alarums now. I always was a quiet lad by natural disposition.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he is not; not exactly. But perhaps, Mr. Mollett, I can do <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> <b>You</b> have <b>known</b> me before, you know, {{and you may}} say to me openly {{anything}} {{you have to say}} to Sir Thomas." ...|$|R
