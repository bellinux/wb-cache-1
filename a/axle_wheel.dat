50|$|Obtaining a DC supply {{controlled}} by rectifiers requires an AC power source. Consequently, the existing auxiliary generator was {{converted to a}} three-phase alternator with automatic voltage regulator. This arrangement gives improved control of traction current over conventional rheostatic systems and gives fine control when starting a train. Normally the driver has to maintain tractive effort well below the rail adhesion limit to give himself time to respond to wheel slip. The constant current systems of Class 74 were designed to allow the driver to apply power very near the limit of adhesion and the booster output is regulated {{in such a way}} that the maximum current of any traction motor group does not exceed the selected value. Thus, even when one motor (<b>axle,</b> <b>wheel</b> set) starts slipping, the voltage across the whole group of motors cannot rise because current in the non-slipping motors is fixed. As one motor begins to slip, its current consumption drops (electric motors use greatest current when stalled and least while free-running) which provides more current for the non-slipping motor (The current for the group is fixed and therefore shared across the motors in the group). The voltage drops proportionately and the slipping motor now partly deprived of power, begins to slow, the slip stops and everything returns to the state it was in before slip set in. Simply speaking the motors all work as a differentially balanced team so that as one motor begins to slip, the others act to balance everything which reduces the speed of the slipping motor almost 'by magic', but maintains torque at a point just below friction break-away. Recovery of wheel slip (providing the driver is not in-attentive or deliberately attempting to slip) is very rapid. It is this system that allowed the incredible acceleration for which Class 74 was known.|$|E
40|$|In this research, {{a series}} of large scale dynamic model tests were carried out on geojute and jute-geocell {{reinforced}} sand subgrade in controlled laboratory condition. The tests are conducted on geojute and jute-geocell (made from waste jute bags) reinforced and unreinforced sand subgrade under repeated loading to simulate traffic conditions. The placement density of sand in all the tests was maintained at 70 % (stiffer subgrade) and 30 % (weaker subgrade). A constant area of geojute and jute-geocell reinforcement was maintained throughout the test series. Cyclic behavior was investigated through varying the density, number of geojute layers and geojute arrangement. The influence of the width and height of the jute-geocell reinforcement on the cyclic behavior of the loading system was studied and performance improvement in terms of traffic benefit ratios and cumulative plastic deformation was determined.

The sand subgrades are prepared at 70 % relative density thru pluviation technic in a large steel tank measuring 1 m 3. A cyclic load of 0. 7 and 7 kN was applied on a circular steel plate of 150 mm diameter to replicate a portion of load transfer from an equivalent single <b>axle</b> <b>wheel</b> load (ESAL) on the sand subgrade. The cyclic load was applied through a double acting dynamic hydraulic 100 kN actuator. A series of tests were conducted to study the effects of width and height of a geocell reinforcement on the cyclic behavior of sand subgrades. The performance improvement is quantified in terms of traffic benefit ratios (TBR), cumulative plastic deformations (CPD), modulus of subgrade reaction (ks), resilient modulus (Mr) and rut depth reduction (RDR) for different number of cycles and plate settlements. The configuration of the geocell that provides highest performance in terms of TBR, CPD, and RDR, is considered to be the optimum size of the geocell. It is observed that the optimum geometry of the geocell is capable of reducing the rut depth of about 75 % at 100 cycles and provide about a TBR of 23 at 10 % of settlement ratio...|$|E
