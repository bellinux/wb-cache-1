5|$|In Suicide (1897), Durkheim {{explores the}} differing suicide rates among Protestants <b>and</b> <b>Catholics,</b> arguing that {{stronger}} social control among Catholics results in lower suicide rates. According to Durkheim, Catholic society has normal levels of integration while Protestant society has low levels. Overall, Durkheim treated suicide {{as a social}} fact, explaining variations in its rate on a macro level, considering society-scale phenomena such as lack of connections between people (group attachment) and lack of regulations of behavior, rather than individuals' feelings and motivations.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon emancipated Jews, {{as well as}} Protestants in Catholic {{countries}} <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> in Protestant countries, from {{laws which}} restricted them to ghettos, and he expanded their rights to property, worship, and careers. Despite the anti-semitic reaction to Napoleon's policies from foreign governments and within France, he believed emancipation would benefit France by attracting Jews to the country given the restrictions they faced elsewhere.|$|E

Four of Gibraltar's changes in rule, including three sieges, took place over a matter of days or hours, whereas several other sieges had durations of months or years and claimed the lives of thousands without resulting in any change in rule.|$|E

5|$|Seeking {{national}} reconciliation between revolutionaries <b>and</b> <b>Catholics,</b> the Concordat of 1801 was signed on 15 July 1801 between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII. It solidified the Roman Catholic Church {{as the majority}} church of France and brought back most of its civil status. The hostility of devout Catholics against the state had now largely been resolved. It did not restore the vast church lands and endowments that had been seized during the revolution and sold off. As {{a part of the}} Concordat, he presented another set of laws called the Organic Articles.|$|E
5|$|The Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) won 237 (239 after by-elections) seats out of 459 {{while the}} {{remainder}} went its satellite parties (Democratic Party and United People's Party) {{and a few}} independents. PZPR 237 seats gave it 51.7% of total, ZSL with 120 (118 after by-elections) had 26.1%, the independents with 63 had 14% (non-party faction, 51, <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> from the Znak association, 12) and SD with 39 had 8.5%. The FJN alliance was victorious, with 80.8% of the seats.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} Catholic {{chronicle of}} the Anonymus Valesianus portrays Eutharic {{in a negative}} light, connecting him with taking the Jews' side in anti-Jewish disturbances in Ravenna over the Jewish congregation's rights to their synagogue; the disagreement prompted a conflict between the Arians <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> as the Arian Eutharic chose {{to side with the}} Jewish people. It is thought that the outrage expressed by the Catholics at this action was in proportion to Eutharic's being a symbol of the recent reconciliation between the Eastern and Western Churches brought about under the direction of Theoderic.|$|E

5|$|Bucer {{believed}} that the Catholics in the Holy Roman Empire could be convinced to join the Reformation. Through a series of conferences organised by Charles V, he tried to unite Protestants <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> to create a German national church separate from Rome. He did not achieve this, as political events led to the Schmalkaldic War and the retreat of Protestantism within the Empire. In 1548, Bucer was persuaded, under duress, to sign the Augsburg Interim, which imposed certain forms of Catholic worship. However, he continued to promote reforms until the city of Strasbourg accepted the Interim, and forced him to leave.|$|E
5|$|Fort Lauderdale's {{first major}} {{development}} {{began in the}} 1920s, during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. The 1926 Miami Hurricane and the Great Depression of the 1930s caused {{a great deal of}} economic dislocation. In July 1935, an African-American man named Rubin Stacy was accused of robbing a white woman at knife point. He was arrested and being transported to a Miami jail when police were run off the road by a mob. A group of 100 white men proceeded to hang Stacy from a tree near the scene of his alleged robbery. His body was riddled with some twenty bullets. The murder was subsequently used by the press in Nazi Germany to discredit US critiques of its own persecution of Jews, Communists, <b>and</b> <b>Catholics.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Belgium, {{political}} {{debate about the}} Royal Question continued and grew after the war, and remained a polemical topic in the popular press, notably in the Francophone newspaper Le Soir. In the general election of 1949, the PSC–CVP campaigned on a pro-Leopold royalist platform. The results reshaped the political landscape; the Communists were routed and the PSB–BSP lost seats to both the Liberals <b>and</b> <b>Catholics.</b> The Catholics gained a new majority in the Senate and a plurality in the Chamber of Representatives, their best results since the war. Gaston Eyskens took over as Prime Minister {{at the head of}} a Liberal-Catholic coalition. Both parties in the government (and Leopold himself) supported a referendum on the King's return, which became the focus of political attention.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Besançon (21 June 1575) was a sectarian {{conflict}} between the Protestants <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> in the French city of Besançon {{in the region of}} Franche-Comté. Prior to the battle, the Huguenots, accused of heresy, had been expelled from the city and fled to the County of Montbéliard and Switzerland; the outcasts formed an army and planned an attempt to retake Besançon and turn the city into a stronghold of the Protestant Reformation. By the time the armed Protestants had reached the city of Besançon however, their army had dwindled because of several mishaps. Nonetheless, the battle began and raged for several hours; the outcome was an overwhelming Catholic victory. The majority of the Protestant army managed to escape, but those who were captured were hanged as traitors. For over two centuries after the battle, Protestantism in Besançon was repressed.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of Christ in pictorial form was highly controversial {{in the early}} church. From the 5th century onward, flat painted icons became popular in the Eastern Church. The Byzantine Iconoclasm acted {{as a barrier to}} developments in the East, but by the ninth century, art was permitted again. The Protestant Reformation brought renewed resistance to imagery, but total prohibition was atypical, and Protestant objections to images have tended to reduce since the 16th century. Although large images are generally avoided, few Protestants now object to book illustrations depicting Jesus. The use of depictions of Jesus is advocated by the leaders of denominations such as Anglicans <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> and is a key element of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century Reformation and Counter-Reformation, Western historians saw the Crusades {{through the}} lens of their own {{religious}} beliefs. Protestants saw them as a manifestation of the evils of the papacy, <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> viewed them as forces for good. 18th century Enlightenment historians tended to view the Middle Ages in general, and the Crusades in particular, as the efforts of barbarian cultures driven by fanaticism. These scholars expressed moral outrage at the conduct of the Crusaders and criticised the Crusades' misdirectionthat of the Fourth in particular, which attacked a Christian power (the Byzantine Empire) instead of Islam. The Fourth Crusade had resulted in the sacking of Constantinople, effectively ending any chance of reconciling the East–West Schism and leading to the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans. In The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, 18th-century English historian Edward Gibbon wrote that the Crusaders' efforts could have been more profitably directed towards improving their own countries.|$|E

5|$|For some Germans, the {{definition}} of nation did not include pluralism, <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> in particular came under scrutiny; some Germans, and especially Bismarck, feared that the Catholics' connection to the papacy might make them less loyal to the nation. As chancellor, Bismarck tried without much success to limit {{the influence of the}} Roman Catholic Church and of its party-political arm, the Catholic Center Party, in schools and education and language-related policies. The Catholic Center Party remained particularly well entrenched in the Catholic strongholds of Bavaria and southern Baden, and in urban areas that held high populations of displaced rural workers seeking jobs in the heavy industry, and sought to protect the rights not only of Catholics, but other minorities, including the Poles, and the French minorities in the Alsatian lands. The May Laws of 1873 brought the appointment of priests, and their education, {{under the control of the}} state, resulting in the closure of many seminaries, and a shortage of priests. The Congregations Law of 1875 abolished religious orders, ended state subsidies to the Catholic Church, and removed religious protections from the Prussian constitution.|$|E
5|$|From Maryland's {{earliest}} days, Cecil Calvert had enjoined its colonists {{to leave}} religious rivalries behind. Along with giving {{instructions on the}} establishment and defense of the colony, he asked the men he appointed to lead it to ensure peace between Protestants <b>and</b> <b>Catholics.</b> He also asked the Catholics to practice their faith as privately as possible, {{so as not to}} disturb that peace. The Ordinance of 1639, Maryland's earliest comprehensive law, expressed a general commitment to the rights of man, but did not specifically detail protections for religious minorities of any kind. Peace prevailed until the English Civil War, which opened religious rifts and threatened Calvert's control of Maryland. In 1647, after the death of Governor Leonard Calvert, Protestants seized control of the colony. Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, quickly regained power, but recognized that religious tolerance not specifically enshrined in law was vulnerable. This recognition was combined with the arrival of a group of Puritans whom Calvert had induced to establish Providence, now Annapolis, by guaranteeing their freedom of worship. Partially to confirm the promises he made to them, Calvert wrote the Maryland Toleration Act and encouraged the colonial assembly to pass it. They did so on April 21, 1649.|$|E
5|$|In 1566 the Burgundian Netherlands, Charles V of Habsburg's {{original}} realm, {{which had}} passed {{to his son}} Philip II of Spain on his abdication in 1556, were in disarray due to religious tensions between Protestants <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> and the nobility and cities' unwillingnes of funding Philip's wars and ceding its powers to the Royal administration. In 1567 Philip sent an army to the Netherlands under Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba, to restore his authority, but Alba's persecution of the religious and political dissenters led William of Orange, {{the leader of the}} nobility, to exile into Germany and prepare an invasion of the Netherlands to expel Alba. Orange invaded the Netherlands twice, in 1568 and 1572, but in both occasions Alba defeated him. The second time, however, the revolt spread into the provinces of Holland and Zealand, and Alba was unable of quelling it. In 1576, the lack of an authority due to the death of Alba's successor Luis de Requesens, together with a Spanish general bankruptcy, led the Spanish mutinuous soldiers to sack several towns, including Antwerp. In reaction, the loyal and rebel provinces united to expel the foreign troops under the Pacification of Ghent.|$|E

5|$|On {{arriving}} in Oxford, Vermigli began lecturing on 1 Corinthians, denouncing Catholic doctrines of purgatory, clerical celibacy, and lenten fasting. He then spoke against the Catholic {{doctrine of the}} Eucharist, the most sensitive area of disagreement between Protestants <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> in England at the time. Conservative faculty, led by Smyth, challenged Vermigli to defend his views in a formal disputation. Smyth fled to St Andrews and finally to Leuven before the disputation could be held, so three Catholic divines, William Tresham, William Chedsey and Morgan Phillips, stepped forward to take his place. The disputation was held in 1549 before Richard Cox, the University Chancellor and a firm Protestant. It focused on the doctrine of transubstantiation, with Vermigli's opponents arguing for it and him against. Chancellor Cox made it obvious that he considered Vermigli to have the better argument, but did not formally declare a winner. The disputation put Vermigli {{at the forefront of}} debates over the nature of the Eucharist.|$|E
5|$|Originally Mary {{believed}} that many nobles supported her marriage, but things soon turned sour between the newly elevated Bothwell (created Duke of Orkney) {{and his former}} peers, and the marriage proved to be deeply unpopular. Catholics considered the marriage unlawful, since they did not recognise Bothwell's divorce or {{the validity of the}} Protestant service. Both Protestants <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> were shocked that Mary should marry the man accused of murdering her husband. The marriage was tempestuous, and Mary became despondent. Twenty-six Scottish peers, known as the confederate lords, turned against Mary and Bothwell, raising an army against them. Mary and Bothwell confronted the lords at Carberry Hill on 15 June, but there was no battle as Mary's forces dwindled away through desertion during negotiations. Bothwell was given safe passage from the field, and the lords took Mary to Edinburgh, where crowds of spectators denounced her as an adulteress and murderer. The following night, she was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle, on an island in the middle of Loch Leven. Between 20 and 23 July, Mary miscarried twins. On 24 July, she was forced to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old son James. Moray was made regent, while Bothwell was driven into exile. He was imprisoned in Denmark, became insane and died in 1578.|$|E
