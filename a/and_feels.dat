50|$|The {{definition}} of the look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> to associate with the application is often done at initialization, but some Widget toolkits, such as the Swing widget toolkit {{that is part of}} the Java API, allow users to change the look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> at runtime (see Pluggable look <b>and</b> <b>feel).</b>|$|R
50|$|Apple Computer was {{notable for}} its {{use of the term}} look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> in {{reference}} to their Mac OS operating system. The firm tried, with some success, to block other software developers from creating software that had a similar look <b>and</b> <b>feel.</b> Apple argued that they had a copyright claim on the look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> of their software, and {{even went so far as}} to sue Microsoft, alleging that the Windows operating system was illegally copying their look <b>and</b> <b>feel.</b>|$|R

50|$|Swing allows an {{application}} to specialize the look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> of widgets by modifying the default (via runtime parameters), deriving from an existing one, by creating one from scratch, or, beginning with J2SE 5.0, {{by using the}} skinnable synth look <b>and</b> <b>feel,</b> which is configured with an XML property file.

50|$|Pluggable look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> is a {{mechanism}} {{used in the}} Java Swing widget toolkit allowing to change the look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> of the graphical user interface at runtime.|$|R
50|$|Swing was {{developed}} {{to provide a more}} sophisticated set of GUI components than the earlier Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). Swing provides a native look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> that emulates the look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> of several platforms, and also supports a pluggable look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> that allows applications to have a look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> unrelated to the underlying platform. It has more powerful and flexible components than AWT. In addition to familiar components such as buttons, check boxes and labels, Swing provides several advanced components such as tabbed panel, scroll panes, trees, tables, and lists.|$|R

50|$|Originally, on the VAX workstations, Ultrix-32 had {{a desktop}} {{environment}} called UWS, Ultrix Workstation Software, {{which was based}} on a version of the X Window System. Later, the widespread version 11 of the X Window System (X11) was added, using a look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> called DECwindows that was devised in order to mimic the look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> of the UWS system. Eventually DECwindows also provided the Motif look <b>and</b> <b>feel.</b>|$|R
5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} in a hurry <b>and</b> <b>feels</b> the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|Unmarried princess Kunti is {{blessed by}} the Sun god {{with a baby}} boy, which she {{abandons}} in the Ganges to avoid embarrassment. The boy is rescued and adopted by charioteer Athirathan and is named Karnan. Years later, the now-grown up Karnan realises that Athirathan is only his adoptive father <b>and</b> <b>feels</b> heartbroken. He {{does not want to}} become a charioteer like Athirathan, and instead chooses to become a warrior. He masters archery and challenges the Pandava prince Arjuna in a contest. Karnan is insulted on account of his lowly birth, but the Kaurava prince and cousin of the Pandavas, Duryodhana, saves his pride, and gives him the kingdom of Anga. Karnan thus becomes the close friend of Duryodhana and his wife Bhanumati.|$|E

His wife claims the skins for herself, intending to line her old cloak with them. But when she {{reaches into the}} sack <b>and</b> <b>feels</b> the vegetables and discovers them, she becomes very, very, angry. Then, as a result, she accuses her husband of playing a trick with her. And Mr. Mc Gregor becomes very angry too, and he throws a rotten vegetable marrow out through the window, hitting {{the youngest of the}} eavesdropping bunnies who has been sitting on the window-sill (leaving the Mc Gregors to argue). Their parents decide it is time to go home. At Christmas, they send the heroic little wood mouse a quantity of rabbit-wool. She makes herself a cloak and a hood, and a muff and mittens.|$|E

5|$|Season {{one begins}} with Alex Parrish, a former FBI recruit, {{becoming}} a prime suspect following {{a terrorist attack}} on Grand Central Terminal. She is taken into custody and charged with treason. Her first escape is orchestrated by Deputy Director Miranda Shaw, her primary instructor at Quantico, who refuses {{to believe that she}} is guilty <b>and</b> <b>feels</b> someone from her class has framed her.

5|$|These {{conflicts}} are {{demonstrated by the}} varying loyalties of the main characters. Genly Ai tells Argaven after Estraven's death that Estraven served mankind as a whole, just as Ai did. During the border dispute with Orgoreyn, Estraven tries to end the dispute by moving Karhidish farmers out of the disputed territory. Estraven believes that by preventing war he was saving Karhidish lives and being loyal to his country, while King Argaven {{sees it as a}} betrayal. At {{the end of the novel}} Ai calls his ship down to formalize Gethen's joining the Ekumen, <b>and</b> <b>feels</b> conflicted while doing so because he had promised Estraven that he would clear Estraven's name before calling his ship down. His decision is an example of Le Guin's portrayal of loyalty and betrayal as complementary rather than contradictory, because in joining Gethen with the Ekumen Ai was fulfilling the larger purpose that he shared with Estraven. Donna White wrote that many of Le Guin's novels depict a struggle between personal loyalties and public duties, best exemplified in The Left Hand of Darkness, where Ai is bound by a personal bond to Estraven, but must subordinate that to his mission for the Ekumen and humanity.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to {{operating}} system user interfaces, for which look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> {{is a part}} of the product identification, widget toolkits often allow users to specialize their application look <b>and</b> <b>feel,</b> by deriving the default look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> of the toolkit, or by completely defining their own. This specialization can go from skinning (that only deals with the look, or visual appearance of the graphical control elements to completely specializing the way the user interacts with the software (that is, the feel).|$|R
