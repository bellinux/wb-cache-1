5|$|Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa: The {{captain of}} the Black Pearl, since taken over from Sparrow. Barbossa <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crew</b> suffer a curse from Aztec gold that makes them a team of living-dead. Verbinski {{approached}} Rush {{for the role of}} Barbossa, as he knew he could hint at the subtle complexities of the character while still portraying a simple villainy that would suit the story's tone.|$|E
5|$|Guayama mayor Francisco Brenes doubled his patrol. Salovi {{was soon}} arrested, and {{informed}} on his shipmates. Hernández Morales led another sloop, intercepting Beagle off Vieques. After a battle, the pirate sloop was captured and Hernández Morales was transported to St. Thomas for trial. After being sentenced to death, he escaped from prison and disappeared for years. According to a St. Thomas resident, on February 12, 1825 the pirates retaliated by {{setting fire to}} a town on the island. That week, Neptune captured a Danish schooner belonging to W. Furniss (a company based in Saint Thomas) off the Ponce coast with a load of imported merchandise. After the assault, Cofresí <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crew</b> abandoned the ship at sea. Later seen floating with broken masts, it was presumed lost. Some time later Cofresí <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crew</b> boarded another ship owned by the company near Guayama, again plundering and abandoning her. Like its predecessor, it was seen near Caja de Muertos (Dead Man's Chest) before disappearing.|$|E

5|$|Low, {{using his}} newly {{captured}} ship, lay in {{wait on the}} popular shipping route between Boston and New York.

Schnaufer, who had been suffering from stomach pains all day, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crew</b> returned to Leeuwarden at 00:14. Rumpelhardt {{had been the first}} to congratulate him on his birthday over the intercom. Their fellow airmen had prepared a birthday celebration. The stomach pains had become unbearable and Schnaufer was taken to a hospital with appendicitis. He stayed in the hospital for about two weeks before, together with Rumpelhardt, he went on vacation back home. Carelessly lifting his suitcase, he burst his stitches, resulting in further hospitalisation. He flew his first mission after these events on 19 March 1944.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor {{finds the}} spaceship's crew long dead from {{exposure}} to a human virus. The trio then discover a sickbay where Avery's entire crew, Toby, and Rory are in medical care along with the TARDIS. The Siren {{turns out to be}} the ship's virtual doctor, caring for the injured humans; the black spots are tissue samples used as references. Amy convinces the Siren to release Rory into her care. Using Rory's nursing knowledge, Amy and the Doctor remove him from life support and are able to resuscitate him. Meanwhile, Avery decides to stay with his son <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crew,</b> unable to go back to England himself while the ship will care for his crew. Avery takes the helm of the spaceship and, along with Toby <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crew,</b> sets off to explore the stars.|$|E
5|$|After their capture, {{the pirates}} {{were held at}} a prison in Guayama before their {{transfer}} to San Juan. Cofresí met with mayor Francisco Brenes, offering him 4,000 pieces of eight (which he claimed to possess) {{in exchange for his}} freedom. Although a key component of modern myth, this is the only historical reference to Cofresí's hiding any treasure. Brenes declined the bribe. Cofresí <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crew</b> remained in Castillo San Felipe del Morro in San Juan {{for the rest of their}} lives. On March 21, 1825, the pirate's reputed servant (known only as Carlos) was arrested in Guayama.|$|E
5|$|Bounty {{had left}} England in 1787 {{on a mission}} to collect and {{transport}} breadfruit plants from Tahiti to the West Indies. A five-month layover in Tahiti, during which many of the men lived ashore and formed relationships with native Polynesians, proved harmful to discipline. Relations between Bligh <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crew</b> deteriorated after he began handing out increasingly harsh punishments, criticism and abuse, Christian being a particular target. After three weeks back at sea, Christian and others forced Bligh from the ship. Twenty-five men remained on board afterwards, including loyalists held against their will and others for whom there was no room in the launch.|$|E

In the town of Thibodaux, Louisiana, Parker <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crew</b> discovered a plantation village that {{would serve as a}} graveyard. An unused Louisiana field was used to create a racetrack where Angel meets the wealthy patriarch Ethan Krusemark (Fontelieu). On May 13, the crew encountered some difficulty filming a chase scene involving Angel, as they had to deal with shying horses, trained dogs, gunshots, two hundred chickens, and a horse specially trained to fall on top of Rourke's stuntman.|$|E
5|$|Federation Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard) of Vulcan {{has arrived}} {{on board the}} Enterprise with his human wife, Perrin (Joanna Miles).

Though Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crew</b> attempt to provide for Sarek and have arranged for a chamber music concert for him, the ambassador expresses apprehension and annoyance. Picard is surprised when Sarek starts crying {{in the middle of the}} performance, an emotional trait Vulcans normally suppress.|$|E
5|$|Finished in Java, Beebe <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crew</b> sailed {{north from}} Singapore to Kuala Lumpur to begin {{exploring}} Malaya.

In Burma Beebe succumbed temporarily to a bout of depression, and it was several days before {{he was able to}} resume working or continue the expedition. He attributed his recovery to the pile of penny dreadful novels he discovered in his bungalow at Pungatong, which he then read constantly for the next few days.|$|E
