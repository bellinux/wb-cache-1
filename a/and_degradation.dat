5|$|Eukaryotic cells {{exposed to}} DNA {{damaging}} agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, protein trafficking <b>and</b> <b>degradation.</b> Such genome wide transcriptional response is very complex and tightly regulated, thus allowing coordinated global response to damage. Exposure of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles. Similarities to environmental shock response {{indicates that a}} general global stress response pathway exist {{at the level of}} transcriptional activation. In contrast, different human cell types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global response. The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in the heterogeneity of mammalian cells. In an animal different types of cells are distributed among different organs that have evolved different sensitivities to DNA damage.|$|E

5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} somatic cells, the poly(A) tail of most mRNAs in the cytoplasm gradually get shorter, and mRNAs with shorter poly(A) tail are translated {{less and}} degraded sooner. However, {{it can take}} many hours before an mRNA is degraded. This deadenylation <b>and</b> <b>degradation</b> process can be accelerated by microRNAs complementary to the 3' untranslated region of an mRNA. In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tails are not degraded, but are instead stored without being translated. They are then activated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation after fertilisation, during egg activation.|$|E
5|$|In many bacteria, both mRNAs and non-coding RNAs can be polyadenylated. This poly(A) tail {{promotes}} degradation by the degradosome, {{which contains}} two RNA-degrading enzymes: polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase E. Polynucleotide phosphorylase binds to the 3' end of RNAs and the 3' extension {{provided by the}} poly(A) tail allows it to bind to the RNAs whose secondary structure would otherwise block the 3' end. Successive rounds of polyadenylation <b>and</b> <b>degradation</b> of the 3' end by polynucleotide phosphorylase allows the degradosome to overcome these secondary structures. The poly(A) tail can also recruit RNases that cut the RNA in two. These bacterial poly(A) tails are about 30 nucleotides long.|$|E

Ecological factors that qualify the bristle-faced free-tailed bat as being at increased risk of the potential impacts of global climate change include habitat (species that rely on riparian habitats in water stress prone environments), foraging type (aerial hawking insectivore), roost type (tree hollow specialist), biogeography (species with limited dispersal ability, limited ranging behaviour) and extreme weather (species that occur in regions where there is an increasing risk of extreme temperature events or changes in rainfall patterns).|$|E

5|$|Many populations, {{particularly}} in the Sydney region, inhabit areas of infrequent disturbance, such as golf courses, disused industrial land, brick pits, and landfill areas. Though {{once one of the}} most common frogs in south-east Australia, the green and golden bell frog has endured major population declines, {{particularly in}} highland areas, leading to its current classification as globally vulnerable. Its numbers have continued to fall and are threatened by habitat loss <b>and</b> <b>degradation,</b> pollution, introduced species, and parasites and pathogens, including the chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. As most of the remaining populations live on private land, the logistics of the conservation effort can be complicated.

However, unfortunately even in these areas the population of green and golden bell has been rapidly declining in the past few decades.|$|E

Typically, loggers first move into rainforest, clearing the vegetation along riverbanks. Farmers follow, creating depleted soil and disrupted habitats. As human activity expands, giant otter home ranges become increasingly isolated. Subadults leaving in search of new territory find it impossible to set up family groups. Specific threats from human industry include unsustainable mahogany logging {{in parts of the}} giant otter range, and concentrations of mercury in its diet of fish, a byproduct of gold mining. Water pollution from mining, fossil fuel extraction, and agriculture is a serious danger; concentrations of pesticides and other chemicals are magnified at each step in the food chain, and can poison top predators such as the giant otter.|$|E
