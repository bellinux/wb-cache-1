40|$|Background: The classic {{laryngeal}} mask airwayTM (cLMA) {{has been demonstrated}} to be effective for airway management during neonatal resuscitation. However, high airway pressures, when required, cannot be achieved with this device. A neonatal prototype of the LMA-ProSealTM (PLMA), which might improve the oropharyngeal leak pressure, has recently been produced. The airway sealing pressures of the cLMA and the PLMA were compared in a neonatal manikin. Methods: A neonatal PLMA and a neonatal cLMA were positioned at random in a neonatal intubation manikin (Neonate Airway Trainer; Laerdal, Norway). A Dr¨ aeger pressure controlled ventilator (Dr¨ aeger 8000; Dr¨ aegerwerk AG, Germany) was con- nected to the <b>airway</b> <b>tubes</b> and increasing inspiratory pressures (from 10 to 40 cm H 2 O) of positive pressure ventilation applied. The peak and the mean airway pres- sures obtained with each device were recorded. Results: The airway pressures obtained with PLMA were signiﬁcantly higher than those obtained with cLMA (p < 0. 01) at levels of positive pressure ventilation of 25, 30, 35 and 40 cm H 2 O. Conclusions: The neonatal PLMA allows higher airway pressure ventilation than the cLMA, in a neonatal intubation manikin.

Long-term data on survival and local recurrence after laryngotracheal resection are scarce. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study of laryngotracheal resection and reconstruction for primary {{tumors of the}} airway since 1972. ResultsTwenty-five patients aged 15 to 77 years presented with adenoid cystic carcinomas (n = 9), squamous cell carcinomas (n = 6), and other airway tumors (n = 10). Subglottic resection consisted of anterior cricoid in 5 patients; posterior cricoid mucosa in 9 patients, with resection of the posterior cricoid plate in 3 patients; lateral resection in 7 patients; and combined anterior and posterior elements in 4 patients. Vascularized trachea was tailored to reconstruct the defect. Seven patients without hoarseness required resection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and 4 other patients with hoarseness did not. There were no operative deaths. Two (8. 0 %) patients who had received prior high-dose cervical radiation had anastomotic separation, one requiring laryngectomy.
