40|$|During {{the period}} of this {{research}} project, electron bombardment ion thrusters have passed from an advanced state of development to highly successful flight demonstrations (e. g. Deep Space 1). Such advances made by NASA have been quickly followed in the commercial sector (e. g. NSSK of communications satellites). In the next few years, these early successes {{will be followed by}} many new electric propulsion missions, planned by the world's space agencies and commercial space organisations. These early successes will spawn more ambitious and demanding missions, necessitating thrusters of different power demands, thrusts and sizes. Scaling of the UK series of electron bombardment ion thrusters has previously been carried out by semi- empirical scaling laws. These scaling laws have worked well within a certain range of thruster sizes with some iterative redesign necessary to produce acceptable efficiencies. However, when scaling beyond the ranges of the T 5, T 6 and UK 25, the current scaling laws cannot be used due to the conflicting requirements of magnetic field strength in the discharge chamber and baffle <b>aperture</b> <b>region.</b> The baffle <b>aperture</b> <b>region</b> contains a plasma double layer that accelerates primary electrons into the discharge chamber and thus controls ionisation in the ion thruster. Previously, the baffle <b>aperture</b> <b>region</b> was poorly understood. An extensive and unique experimental investigation of the plasma properties around this critical baffle <b>aperture</b> <b>region</b> has been carried out using Langmuir probes. The externally applied magnetic field has been mapped and the Langmuir probe results have been validated using emissive probes. Results are presented on both argon and xenon propellant and high- resolution maps of an extensive range of plasma properties are plotted over a continuous area from the coupling plasma, through the baffle aperture and into the discharge plasma. Maps were taken over a unique and wide range of thruster operating conditions in which all actively controllable thruster parameters were varied. Unique maps of mono-energetic primary electrons are presented. Theoretical models have been used to create a novel and detailed understanding of the baffle aperture potential difference. Current flow through the baffle aperture is shown to be non-classical and can be modelled using the electron fluid equation with anomalous diffusion and mobility coefficients. The potential difference is classed as a magnetised or an unmagnetised double sheath, depending upon the operating conditions. Two types of primary electron spatial distributions were found and these strongly correlated to the type of double sheath. A new scaling law for the baffle <b>aperture</b> <b>region</b> is proposed and schematics presented on how such a law may obeyed, thus increasing the range of sizes for which the thruster scaling laws are valid.

30|$|The reduced thermal {{performance}} {{compared to a}} one fracture system {{can be explained by}} the relationship between pressure drop and the {{thermal performance}} in an individual fracture. In general, a fracture with a small <b>aperture</b> <b>region</b> in between the injection and production wells will exhibit enhanced thermal performance because the flow will expand and sweep through the reservoir more effectively. The reverse is true; a high <b>aperture</b> <b>region</b> in between the wells will promote flow short circuiting and the flow will primarily harvest thermal energy in a narrow area. This behavior was illustrated in Fig.  1, where the temperature of the fracture surface was plotted along side their respective aperture fields. Furthermore, a low aperture wellbore region requires a higher pressure drop to push the fluid through the constricted region surrounding both the injection and production wells. The covariance of w_H and Θ _p for the single fracture is - 0.65 when L/(2 R)= 0.4, ζ = 0.8, and σ _h/〈 w 〉 = 0.25, which supports our qualitative argument.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{cylindrical}} sample, 0. 5 m {{in diameter}} and length, was obtained by excavation from 3. 7 – 4. 2 m depth below ground surface in a surficial deposit of fractured glaciolacustrine clay. The sample was enclosed in a triaxial cell in a cold room to impose conditions close to field temperature and stress. Hydraulic testing using a hydraulic gradient of 2 provided a saturated hydraulic conductivity of 7 3 10210 m/s, which is only slightly larger than the matrix hydraulic conductivity. The cubic law provided a mean hydraulic aperture of 5 – 6 mm for the four continuous vertical fractures in the sample. A column of immiscible-phase trichloroethene (TCE) imposed incrementally {{at the top of}} the sample provided an entry-pressure-derived aperture equal to 17 mm for a parallel-plate fracture. TCE dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) that flowed through the sample produced dissolved-phase diffusion haloes in the matrix that indicated the preferential fracture pathways. These haloes indicated that DNAPL flowed through only 5 – 15 % of the visible, oxidation-stained fractures; hence natural fractures had variable apertures along their length, and the larger <b>aperture</b> <b>regions</b> provided channels for fluid flow. Using the hydraulic test results and applying the cubic law only to the aperture segments of confirmed DNAPL flow, an equivalent hydraulic aperture of 8 – 11 mm was obtained, which is greater than the conventional mean hydraulic aperture and smaller than the local aperture determined from the DNAPL entry pressure. These differences are large in the context of fluid flux, which is proportional to the aperture cubed. 1...|$|R

Over the past years, various ambiguity validation methods have been proposed, such as F-ratio test, R-ratio test, difference test, projector test, ellipsoidal integer aperture (EIA) estimator and penalized integer aperture (PIA) estimator. In this paper, through analysis and testing, we find that, when the <b>aperture</b> <b>region</b> of EIA is not allowed to be overlapped, the efficiency of ambiguity resolution with EIA is low and it is not applicable to fast static positioning or real-time kinematic (RTK) applications.

40|$|Field {{evidence}} suggests that two-phase flow may develop near underground excavations in regionally-saturated fractured crystalline rock, resulting in lower inflow rates compared to undisturbed rock. Mechanisms {{for the development of}} two-phase flow conditions include depressurization of formation water that is supersaturated with dissolved gas and buoyancy-driven air invasion into fractures from the drift. Models that assume gas-liquid phase equilibrium indicate that for constant head boundary conditions, the build-up of pressure behind the gas phase evolving from depressurization should redissolve the gas and maintain higher flowrates, requiring unreasonably high dissolved gas concentrations to produce observed flow reductions at the Stripa Mine in Sweden. This discrepancy initiated a laboratory-scale investigation. Gas evolution following depressurization is simulated in two different 8 cm x 8 cm transparent fracture replicas for linear flow with constant head boundary conditions. Gas forms and accumulates in the large apertures and the extent of flow reduction is greater when the flow through the fracture is controlled by a large aperture channel, compared to a fracture where large <b>aperture</b> <b>regions</b> are relatively isolated. An effective continuum numerical model (TOUGH 2) is used to describe the development of two-phase flow under degassing conditions. Numerical simulations were made for a homogeneous porous medium and for a heterogeneous medium using the aperture distribution of one of the fractures used in the laboratory experiments, which allows a direct comparison between laboratory and numerical results.

In {{the case of}} smooth parallel walls, fibers of finite length ℓ = 20 - 150 mm move at a constant velocity {{of the order of}} the maximum fluid velocity in the aperture. In contrast, for fibers lying initially at the inlet side of the model and dragged by the flow inside it, the velocity increases with the depth of penetration (this results from the lower velocity - and drag - in the inlet part). In both cases, the friction of the fiber with the smooth walls is weak.

For each five thousand fracture realization data set, the values of Θ̅_p, σ _Θ, and F are reported based on the thermal performance for all realizations {{at the time when}} the dimensionless production temperature reached 0.8 in the absence of aperture variations. A depiction of the fracture surface temperature for the base case, thermally under performing, and thermally over performing (compared with the base case) and their corresponding aperture fields is shown in Fig.  1. The dimensionless heat transfer area accessed at a certain time is defined as ∫ (1 -Θ [...]) dA/A= 1 -〈Θ〉. Thus, the mean fracture surface temperature 〈Θ〉 {{is a measure of the}} thermally accessed area of the fracture at a given extraction time. Comparing 〈Θ〉 for different fracture aperture distributions, a fracture with a lower value of 〈Θ〉 was able to access more area of the reservoir for heat transfer. For dipole flow, the majority of the flow occurs in the region surrounding the injection and production wells with less flow in the periphery of the fracture. The base case mean value for 〈Θ〉 is 0.816 when Θ _p, 0 = 0.8. For a fracture with smaller apertures in the region between the wells, the fluid is pushed to higher aperture regions in the periphery and the effective heat transport area increases, 〈Θ〉 = 0.787 when the dimensionless production temperature reaches 0.8. As expected, this less channeled, beneficial flow field leads to a higher production temperature and slows the rate of thermal drawdown. On the other hand, when there exists a high <b>aperture</b> <b>region</b> in between the wells, the flow is further channeled from the injection to production well and the effective heat transfer area becomes narrower than the base case; the mean dimensionless fracture surface temperature is 0.854 when the dimensionless production temperature is 0.8. Consequently, the production well cools down rapidly. How the low and high aperture regions are arranged in the fracture is clearly important in determining whether the reservoir will exhibit poor or good thermal performance.|$|E

An important feature of the dipole wake potential for large u/x is the strong dominance of the lowest frequency mode compared to the sum of all higher modes. If an accelerating structure is composed of alternating sections having different disk apertures, then the lowest frequency mode in the two types of structure will also occur at slightly different frequencies.

40|$|Restricted until 16 Feb. 2012. An {{array antenna}} {{consists}} {{of a group of}} radiating elements forming a single aperture to transmit and receive electromagnetic energy. This work focuses on the analysis, development, and design of array antennas geared towards operation over wide frequency bandwidths. As a consequence of the present effort, both the geometry and the operation theory of a louver array antenna are developed, and their use in wide-band antenna arrays investigated.; This dissertation begins by first establishing the electromagnetic boundary condition associated with the radiating aperture of an antenna array made of identical cells. Then, it proceeds to impose this condition on Maxwell's equations to yield the array radiated field as an infinite plane wave spectrum.; To properly investigate the energy transfer efficiency of an array, from circuit to free space, the Poynting theorem is used to determine the power balance equation of the antenna. From this analysis, an aperture reflection coefficient is defined and introduced as a convenient figure-of-merit to gauge the effectiveness of the antenna as an energy transducer. For demonstration purposes, this aperture reflection coefficient is then applied to study the characteristics of the frequently used rectangular microstrip patch array. It is shown that the patch array geometry is prone to excite evanescent fields (i. e., store reactive energy) in its <b>aperture</b> <b>region,</b> causing it to require a highly reactive, and therefore narrow band, matching network behind each element to ensure proper operation. In contrast, the louver array primarily excites a dominant mode field that exactly emulates the desired radiated plane wave, with nearly no evanescent field generation. Since a band-limiting matching structure is not required (to compensate evanescent fields), the louver antenna is inherently wideband. In addition to this fact, the louver antenna is amenable to be integrated directly with semiconductor electronics. This feature allows the future implementation of a densely populated array antenna with fractional wavelength element spacing to enable broad band, wide angle, grating-lobe-free beam scan.; Even though no experimental work was performed for this research, a systematic array design and analysis procedure is presented {{at the end of this}} dissertation. To demonstrate their application, a louver array antenna is then designed for a 30 -to- 1 operation frequency band. As a preliminary validation, this louver array is then modeled using an established commercial finite-element numerical analysis software. Both the analytically and the numerically predicted array performances obtained show close agreement. This validates the design and analysis procedures presented, as well as demonstrate their applicability for implementing high efficiency, wideband, wide scan angle array antennas...|$|E
40|$|We derive {{spatially}} resolved stellar kinematics for {{a sample}} of 84 out of 104 observed local (0. 02 3 ̆c z 3 ̆c 0. 09) galaxies hosting type- 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs), based on long-slit spectra obtained at the 10 m W. M. Keck- 1 Telescope. In addition to providing central stellar velocity dispersions, we measure major axis rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles using three separate wavelength regions, including the prominent Ca H 2 ̆ 6 K, Mg Ib, and Ca II NIR stellar features. In this paper, we compare kinematic measurements of stellar velocity dispersion obtained for different <b>apertures,</b> wavelength <b>regions,</b> and signal-to-noise ratios, and provide recipes to cross-calibrate the measurements reducing systematic effects {{to the level of}} a few percent. We also provide simple recipes based on readily observable quantities such as global colors and Ca H 2 ̆ 6 K equivalent width that will allow observers of high-redshift AGN hosts to increase the probability of obtaining reliable stellar kinematic measurements from unresolved spectra in the region surrounding the Ca H 2 ̆ 6 K lines. In subsequent papers in this series, we will combine this unprecedented spectroscopic data set with surface photometry and black hole mass measurements to study in detail the scaling relations between host galaxy properties and black hole mass...|$|R
40|$|GNSS {{carrier phase}} {{ambiguity}} resolution {{is the key}} to fast and high-precision satellite positioning and navigation. It applies to a great variety of current and future models of GPS, modernized GPS and Galileo. In (Teunissen, 1998, 1999) we introduced the class of admissible integer (I) estimators and showed that the integer least-squares estimator is the optimal ambiguity estimator within this class. In (Teunissen, 2002 a, b) we introduced the class of integer equivariant (IE) estimators and determined the best ambiguity estimator within this class. This best integer equivariant estimator is unbiased and of minimum variance. In the present contribution we will introduce a third class of ambiguity estimators. This class of integer aperture (IA) estimators is larger than the I-class, but smaller than the IE-class. The IA-estimator is of a hybrid nature since its outcome may be integer-valued or real-valued. We also give a probabilistic description of IA-estimators. This is needed {{in order to be able}} to propagate the inherent uncertainty in the data rigorously and to give a proper probabilistic evaluation of the final result. The framework of IA-estimation also incorporates the important problem of ambiguity discernibility. By setting the size and shape of the integer <b>aperture</b> pull-in <b>region</b> of an IA-estimator, the user has control over the fail-rate of the estimator and thus also over the amount of discernibility...|$|R
50|$|A long {{nematode}} {{compared to}} other plant parasitic nematodes at 2-3 mm for both the male and female. Description: The lip region is hemispherical, divided bilateral, dorsal, and ventral with grooves into 4 main lobes (2 subdorsal and 2 subventral) each bearing 6 or more horizontal striations; two smaller lobes (lateral) with amphid <b>apertures.</b> The lip <b>region</b> is generally set off from the body by deep constriction, but this may be less marked in some populations. The lateral field {{is marked by a}} single incisure extending {{from the base of the}} lip region to near the tail terminus. The stylet is 100-140 µm long; it is very thin and flexible with rounded knobs. The excretory pore is posterior to median bulb. The esophageal gland is lobe-like and extends anteriorly over the intestine. The tail is 115-189 µm long with a rounded terminus.|$|R
40|$|Human {{skeletal}} remains are analysed by forensic anthropologists {{in order to}} draw conclusions about the probable identity of the deceased. During the analysis, the skull is used, along with other bones, to help determine {{the identity of the}} decedent. If only the base of the skull is available, forensic researchers take manual measurements from the large oval <b>aperture</b> in this <b>region,</b> the foramen magnum, in order to obtain information about the gender of the deceased. As this operation requires human intervention, the measurements are affected by the bias introduced by the human operator.
