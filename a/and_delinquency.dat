5|$|Lead {{exposure}} in children is also correlated with neuropsychiatric {{disorders such as}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} and anti-social behaviour. Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with higher scores on aggression <b>and</b> <b>delinquency</b> measures. A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood lead exposure and violent crime in adulthood. Countries with the highest air lead levels have also been found to have the highest murder rates, after adjusting for confounding factors. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US. A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood lead and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries. Lead {{exposure in}} childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} parental alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and child violent <b>and</b> nonviolent <b>delinquency.</b> It also explores the mediating effects of executive functioning and chronic family stress on the parental AUD/child delinquency relationship. Method: Participants were 816 families with children (414 boys and 402 girls) born between 1981 and 1984 at Mater Misericordiae Mother 2 ̆ 7 s Hospital in Brisbane, Australia. Parents and children completed semistructured interviews, questionnaires and neuropsychological tests that assessed parental alcohol use, family psychiatric history, chronic family stress, child <b>delinquency</b> <b>and</b> child executive functioning.

Three hypotheses were tested <b>and</b> confirmed. <b>Delinquency</b> (total <b>and</b> all subscales) successfully predicted verbal abuse. Attitudes supporting aggression contributed significant increments in the variance of verbal abuse above <b>and</b> beyond <b>delinquency</b> alone.
