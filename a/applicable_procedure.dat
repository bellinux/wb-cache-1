40|$|AbstractEstimating {{cable tension}} in {{cable-stayed}} bridges or in external tendons {{is essential for}} regular inspection and assessment of those structures. Vibration measurements provide a solution, however, may not be accurate in cases parameters such as amount of sag and flexural rigidity of cable are significant. In this study, the characteristic equation for vibration of the most general case of a cable, where both the sag and flexure in the cable are taken into account, is analytically derived. After that by considering proper simplifying assumptions of small flexural rigidity parameter, asymptotic forms of that equation are obtained. It renders a practically <b>applicable</b> <b>procedure</b> to estimate cable tension using measured natural frequencies.

As a result previously unsatisfied predicates may later become satisfied and their associated procedures are selected for execution.
