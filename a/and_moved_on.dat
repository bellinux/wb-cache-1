5|$|In 1944 and 1945, as the German {{situation}} deteriorated, {{provision of}} food to POW camps became more sporadic and starvation became a problem.

5|$|The region around Brough {{continued}} to be disputed between the kings of England and Scotland; in 1173, William the Lion of Scotland invaded {{as part of the}} Great Revolt against the rule of Henry II. William's army struck south but failed to take Wark <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> to attack Carlisle instead; when that failed too, they successfully took Appleby before turning their attention to Brough.|$|E
5|$|A {{long period}} of waiting and {{training}} followed. Throughout 1943–1944, the division was re-organised under the jungle divisional establishment. This saw {{a reduction in the}} division's artillery, vehicles, equipment and manning, with divisional strength falling from around 18,000 men to about 16,000. The division also lost many of its experienced personnel during this time as they were promoted <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> to other formations; although it also received reinforcements from the disbanded 30th Brigade. The division's next deployment would not come until November 1944 when they were committed to the Aitape–Wewak campaign. Once again they would be unified as a full division, with several units that had previously been detached, including the 2/3rd Field Regiment and the 19th Brigade, rejoining the division.|$|E
5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E

The fleet left from Hampton Roads, passed by Trinidad and Rio de Janeiro, and then {{passed through the}} Straits of Magellan. From there she passed by {{the west coast of}} South America, visiting Punta Arenas and Valparaíso, Chile, Callao, Peru, and Magdalena Bay, Mexico. The fleet reached San Diego on 14 April 1908 <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> to San Francisco on 6 May.

He left Thrace under the control of his son Matthew <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> to Selymbria, close to Constantinople. He did not attack the capital, but waited for almost a year for the city to surrender. In his memoirs, he {{explains}} {{that he did not want}} to turn his Turks on the city, although contemporaries such as Gregoras accused him of indecision and of needlessly prolonging the war.|$|E
5|$|Graysmith {{first met}} Fischer and Vanderbilt at {{the premiere of}} Paul Schrader's film, Auto Focus, {{which was based on}} Graysmith's 1991 book about {{the life and death of}} actor Bob Crane. A deal was made and they optioned the rights to Zodiac and Zodiac Unmasked when they became {{available}} after languishing at another studio for nearly a decade. David Fincher was their first choice to direct based on his work on Seven. Originally, he was going to direct an adaptation of James Ellroy's novel, The Black Dahlia (later filmed by Brian De Palma), and envisioned a five-hour, $80 million mini-series with film stars.

5|$|I. C. Filitti {{studied at}} Saint Sava National College, {{where he was}} colleagues with future {{politician}} (and adversary) Ion G. Duca. He was an eminent student, who earned top distinctions annually, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> to study at the École Libre des Sciences Politiques in Paris. His first ever published work as a historian was a French-language tome, Le Rôle diplomatique des phanariotes de 1700 à 1821 ("The Diplomatic Role of Phanariotes from 1700 to 1821"). Signed Jean C. Filitti, it was probably his Licence ès Lettres, and, although receiving good reviews, was never listed by its author in his official résumés.

He married Ellen Parkinson in 1927, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> to Victoria College at the University of Toronto in 1929. Havelock's scholarly work during this period focused on Latin poetry, particularly Catullus, far from the early Greek philosophy he had worked on at Cambridge. While in Canada Havelock became increasingly involved in politics. With his fellow academics Frank Underhill and Eugene Forsey, Havelock was a cofounder of the League for Social Reconstruction, an organisation of politically active socialist intellectuals. He and Underhill were also the most outspoken {{of a group of}} dissident faculty members at the University.|$|E

5|$|Marble Madness was commercially {{successful}} {{following its}} December 1984 release and was positively received by critics. Around 4,000cabinets were sold, and {{it soon became}} the highest-earning game in arcades. However, the game consistently fell from this ranking during its seventh week in arcades that Atari tracked the game's success. Cerny attributed the six-week arcade life to Marble Madnesss short gameplay length. He believed that players lost interest after mastering it <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> to other games. The arcade cabinets have since become fairly rare. Stan Szczepanski holds the official world record of 187,880 points.|$|E
