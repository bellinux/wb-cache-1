5|$|Cells {{that stop}} {{dividing}} (post-mitotic) and differentiate into neurons early in cortical development {{are important in}} laying the groundwork on which other developing neurons can be guided to their proper destination. Tbr1 aids in neuronal migration in the early development of the cerebral cortex. It is largely expressed in post-mitotic neurons of the preplate, which forms <b>a</b> <b>foundation</b> upon which neurons are able to grow and move. As a transcription factor, Tbr1 modulates the expression of RELN, which encodes the Reln protein that forms part of the extracellular matrix of cells. Thus, through regulation of Reln expression, Tbr1 regulates {{the formation of the}} matrix through which neurons migrate. Without Tbr1, neurons fail to migrate properly.|$|E
