The resulting controllers have been successfully implemented on the Kestrel autopilot (which has a low-power micro-controller) and flight tested on three different miniature air vehicles (MAVs).

60|$|It must be added, however, {{that she}} would have been at a loss to determine--and {{certainly}} at first--to which order, that of self-control or that of large expression, the step she had taken the afternoon of her husband's return from Matcham with his companion properly belonged. For it had been a step, distinctly, on Maggie's part, her deciding to do something, just then and there, which would strike Amerigo as unusual, and this even though her departure from custom had merely consisted in her so arranging that he wouldn't find her, as he would definitely expect to do, in Eaton Square. He would have, strangely enough, as might seem to him, to come back home for it, and there get the impression of her rather pointedly, or at least all impatiently and independently, awaiting him. These were small variations and mild manoeuvres, but they went accompanied on Maggie's part, as we have mentioned, with an infinite sense of intention. Her watching by his fireside for her husband's return from an absence might superficially have presented itself as the most natural act in the world, and the only one, into the bargain, on which he would positively have reckoned. It fell by this circumstance into the order of plain matters, and yet the very aspect by which it was, in the event, handed over to her brooding fancy was {{the fact that she had}} done with it all she had designed. She had put her thought to the proof, and the proof had shown its edge; this was what was before her, that she was no longer playing with blunt and idle tools, with weapons that didn't cut. There passed across her vision ten times a day the gleam of a bare blade, and at this it was that she most shut her eyes, most knew the impulse to cheat herself with motion and sound. She had merely driven, on a certain Wednesday, to Portland Place, instead of remaining in Eaton Square, and she privately repeated it again and again-- there had appeared beforehand no reason why she should have seen the mantle of history flung, by a single sharp sweep, over so commonplace a deed. That, all the same, was what had happened; it had been bitten into her mind, all in an hour, that nothing she had ever done would hereafter, in some way yet to be determined, so count for her--perhaps not even what she had done in accepting, in their old golden Rome, Amerigo's proposal of marriage. And yet, by her little crouching posture there, that of a timid tigress, she had meant nothing recklessly ultimate, nothing clumsily fundamental; so that she called it names, the invidious, the grotesque <b>attitude,</b> <b>holding</b> it up to her own ridicule, reducing so far as she could the portee of what had followed it. She had but wanted to get nearer--nearer to something indeed that she couldn't, {{that she would}}n't, even to herself, describe; and the degree of this achieved nearness was what had been in advance incalculable. Her actual multiplication of distractions and suppressions, whatever it did for her, failed to prevent her living over again any chosen minute--for she could choose them, she could fix them--of the freshness of relation produced by her having administered to her husband the first surprise to which she had ever treated him. It had been a poor thing, but it had been all her own, and the whole passage was backwardly there, a great picture hung on the wall of her daily life, for her to make what she would of.|$|E

40|$|As is {{very well}} known, {{intellectual}} property rights throughout the world have recently experienced a massive expansionist trend. Patent law has slowly stretched the boundaries of patentable subject matter to cover DNA sequences, software and business methods, leaving commentators to wonder whether it still make sense to inquire about what can and cannot be patented in the first place. Similarly, copyright law has been expanding in all possible directions: not just new subject matters have been added and new set of rights created, but the length of protection has been extended, and even {{a new set of}} exclusive rights has been created to protect technological measures that, in turn, are meant to protect copyrighted works. Such trends have been strongly backed by a reverse tendency in the application of antitrust laws towards anticompetitive practices involving intangible monopolies. After a period of hostility when antitrust laws, both in U. S. and E. U., severely constrained IP-owners’ licensing practices and unilateral behaviors, the wind changed again toward a more pro-IP attitude. This new approach has {{played a central role in}} strengthening IP-owners’ exclusive rights by allowing them to obtain a far greater monopoly than the one they were entitled to. Despite the major commonalities of approaches taken by United States and Europe, it is important to point out that some discrepancies have occurred with regard to the way the two systems have assessed anticompetitive behaviors endorsed by dominant firms whose position of strength stems, in great part, from intellectual property rights. Indeed, as I will show in this study, American antitrust treatment of refusal to deal cases has created a de facto immunity from antitrust intervention for unilateral conduct of dominant undertaking holding intellectual assets. Conversely, European antitrust law has endorsed a more restrictive <b>attitude,</b> <b>holding</b> that when exceptional circumstances do exist, the exclusive faculty of the IP-owner can be curtailed in favor of a more competitive structure of the market. As I will explain, the reasons for these discrepancies can be also traced back to more general differences of American and European assessment of anticompetitive unilateral conduct. This study is divided into three sections. The first section will be devoted to a comparative study of American and European antitrust provisions dealing with unilateral exclusionary conduct. Here it will be explained that although section 2 of the Sherman Act and Article 82 of the EC Treaty seem to share several commonalities, many significant differences do exist regarding both the normative framework and the practical assessment of the cases. The second part will be specifically concerned with the analysis of American and European cases involving the intersection between intellectual property rights and antitrust law. The third and last part will comment on the economic significance of intellectual property rights, and thus on the proper weight they should be afforded in an antitrust analysis...|$|E

The CER is a proposed space robot that deploys from the Space Station and retrieves any lost equipment or incapacitated astronauts. The moment of inertia tensor for the CER and acquired target is not known a priori.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for an {{efficient}} control of the aircraft landing and attitude through Dynamic Matrix Control. The idea of MPC structures used in aircraft control has been well established {{during the last few}} years, but some aspects require further investigation. With this in mind, the paper proposes structures for aircraft landing and aircraft attitude control by using single DMC controllers for landing and respectively one DMC controller for each of the attitude axis (pitch <b>attitude</b> <b>hold,</b> bank angle hold and heading hold). The model used for analysis of the aircraft landing structure is based on the last phase of landing. Also, the model used to illustrate the attitude control is that of a pitch <b>attitude</b> <b>hold</b> system of a N 250 - 100 aircraft. Simulations are performed for a variety of control and prediction horizons, taking into account the possibility of adding a weighting factor for the control actions. Apart from separate studies on step reference variations, for some use cases, a generic reference trajectory is provided as a control purpose of the system. Results show a better performance of the proposed method in terms of control surface transition and protection of the actuators involved and a better time response in stabilizing the aircraft attitude.

The system is fully augmented to provide flight path control and velocity control, and rate command <b>attitude</b> <b>hold</b> for angular axes during the transition and hover operations. In cruise mode, the {{flight control system}} is configured to provide direct thrust command, rate command <b>attitude</b> <b>hold</b> for pitch and roll axes, and sideslip command with turn coordination.

The nonlinear inverse transformation is used to determine the propulsive forces and nozzle deflections, which in combination with the aerodynamic forces and moments (including propulsive induced contributions), and gravitational force, are required to achieve the longitudinal and vertical acceleration commands. The longitudinal control axes are fully decoupled within the propulsion system's performance envelope.

The non-linear model consists in a contribution of main rotor, tail rotor, fuselage, gravitational model, horizontal and vertical tail rotor. The U 1 -H 1 main rotor non-linear mathematical model was build by use of blade element momentum theory, inflow dynamics and flapping dynamics. The total forces and moments are used in 6 degrees of freedom equations of motion model and helicopter states are obtained for hover conditions and forward flight. Trim and linearization process was done by Heli-Dyn R Software. The second part consists in a stability augmentation systems (SAS) followed by a set of automatic flight control systems (AFCS) designed by use of PID controllers. The AFCS main objective is to ease the pilot by decreasing the workload. The stability augmentation systems was designed by use of optimal control, especially Linear Quadratic Tracking Controller (LQT) and Linear Quadratic Regulator Controller (LQR).
