After having a conservation with Treville, he tells Corinne {{that she is not}} ready and she is disappointed that this day is not turning out as she had hoped.

40|$|Myracrodruon urundeuva Fr. All. is a {{tree species}} {{threatened}} by human pressure. For this reason, {{this research aimed}} at evaluating the behavior of two populations of M. urundeuva in a heterogeneous plantation as a support for genetic ex situ conservation. Two progeny tests of M. urundeuva were evaluated. The tests were established in Selvíria, MS in 1992 as a heterogeneous plantation, composed of 25 families from <b>Aramina,</b> SP and 25 from Selviria, MS. The following silvicultural traits were evaluated: DBH (Diameter at breast height), DMC (average diameter of crown), height (ALT), stem form (FOR) and survival (SOB). The results based on the REML/BLUP method, suggest that populations of M. urundeuva from <b>Aramina</b> and Selviria have a good adaptation to environmental conditions of Selvíria. This became evident by the high survival rate. Genetic variation was higher in the Selvíria population {{when compared to the}} <b>Aramina</b> population. By using multi-effect index (IME), it is possible to select progenies that can provide a good selection gain and high variation. In that case, a maximum Kf must be established. This condition yields a higher genetic gain in the Selvíria than in the <b>Aramina</b> population...|$|E
40|$|General Description. —Caesar weed is {{also known}} as {{hibiscus}} bur, <b>aramina,</b> pink Chinese burr, bur mallow, grand cousin, cadillo, carrapicho do mata, malva, mahot cousin, cousin petit, cousin rouge, jut africain, cooze mahot, dadangsi, and mautofu. It is a subshrub 0. 6 to 3 m in height and up to 7 cm in basal diameter. The species usually has a single stem emerging from the ground but normally produces several stems or major branches low on the stem and many branches throughout. The nearly smooth bark is tough and fibrous, brown on the outside and green within. Its pale yellow wood is of medium density. Plants are supported by a tap and lateral root system of tan or ivory-colored, tough and flexible roots. Grayishgreen, discolorous, alternate leaves are stellatepubescent both above and below, ovate, angulate or shallowly lobbed, 1 to 12 by 1 to 12 cm, and have serrate margins. Axillary flowers are usually solitary and have five pink petals. The flowers are about 1 cm broad. The fruits are 8 - to 10 -mm globose capsules that break into five fine-barbed (glochidate) mericarps. (Howard 1989, Liogier 1994, Stevens and others 2001) Range. —The original range of Caesar weed is probably Asiatic. Today it grows throughout moist tropic and subtropical regions including America...|$|E
