5|$|Roy Harper {{had been}} {{regularly}} appearing {{at a number}} of Hyde Park festivals since 1968 <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> popularity increase as a result of these. This eventually resulted in Blackhill's Peter Jenner managing him, leading to a contract with Harvest Records. For 5 July gig, he contributed a one-song set between equipment changes.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg {{entered the}} round as the {{defending}} race winner and championship leader, with a twenty-four-point advantage over teammate Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton started the race from pole {{and went on}} to win the race after colliding with Rosberg on the final lap; as a result, Rosberg finished fourth behind Max Verstappen and Kimi Räikkönen, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> championship lead cut to eleven points. Mercedes led rivals Ferrari by eighty-one points in the Constructors' standings at the start of the round, extending their lead to one hundred and three after Sebastian Vettel retired.|$|E
5|$|Feyenoord were {{paired with}} fellow Dutch side PSV Eindhoven in the quarter–finals, and the tie {{came down to}} a penalty shootout, which Feyenoord won 5–4. The first leg was drawn 1–1 with Feyenoord taking the lead in first half injury time through Pierre van Hooijdonk. PSV {{equalised}} two minutes after the restart when Mateja Kežman scored on 47 minutes. The second leg was again drawn 1–1, with PSV taking the lead on 75 minutes, when Mark van Bommel scored from outside the penalty area. That looked to have sent PSV into the semi-finals, but with seconds remaining, Van Hooijdonk scored from Johan Elmander's cross to send the tie into extra-time. PSV were reduced to ten men in extra time when Van Bommel was sent off for a second bookable offence but they still managed to hold out for the extra 30 minutes to force a penalty shootout. All penalties were converted until Giorgi Gakhokidze stepped up, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> penalty saved. Feyenoord converted their subsequent penalties, with Van Hooijdonk putting away the vital fifth penalty.|$|E

5|$|In May 2004, del Potro won {{his first}} senior match, {{at the age of}} 15, at the ITF Circuit event in Buenos Aires by {{defeating}} Matias Niemiz. He then went on to lose in three sets to Sebastián Decoud in the second round. His next victory came over five months later against the Chilean Álvaro Loyola in a tournament in Antofagasta. Later that year, del Potro reached the quarterfinals of the ITF Circuit event in Campinas, Brazil; recording victories over Henrique Mello and Alessandro Camarco. Del Potro won two more matches {{before the end of the}} year <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> world ranking rise from no. 1441 in August to no. 1077 in November. He also reached the finals in the Argentina Cup and Campionati Internazionali D'Italia Junior tournaments.|$|E

25|$|The Frends {{moved back}} to central London—Tavistock Square—in 1831. Around 1832, Sophia {{expressed}} scepticism about a phrenological reading of Ada's head, by James De Ville, that had been arranged by her mother. In June 1833 Ada visited Charles Babbage <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> difference engine, and Sophia reported that she had understood {{the principle of the}} machine.

25|$|Goldman further {{asserted}} that this {{turn of events}} was caused, not only by Lennon's own native laziness and dependence on strong women throughout his life to manage his affairs (other than his marriage to Cynthia, in which he took a dominant role), but through the instigation and manipulation of Yoko Ono, who Goldman claimed in the book was jealous of Lennon <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> fame as competition for her own musical ambitions.|$|E
25|$|With the {{emergence}} of rookie Sam Bennett, Stajan centred the Flames' fourth line throughout the following season, 2015–16, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> offensive production decrease accordingly. Stajan went from 17 points in 59 games in 2014–15 to 17 points in 80 games in 2015–16. Coach Bob Hartley was fired in the offseason following a disastrous 2015-16 campaign, and was replaced with former Canucks assistant Glen Gulutzan, who quickly re-established Stajan's third-line poisition, this time with Kris Versteeg and Troy Brouwer.|$|E
25|$|His {{only son}} Charles III, age 31, was assassinated on 27 March 1854. In 1854 Charles Louis moved to Paris. In 1856 he visited his son's tomb in Viareggio <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> wife. His grandson, Robert I, who was reigning in Parma under the regency of his mother, Louise Marie Thérèse, lost his throne in March 1860 during the Italian {{unification}}. Charles Louis, unlike other dethroned Italian monarchs, welcomed {{the unification of}} Italy as a positive development.|$|E

25|$|Relatives in both Russia and Sweden viewed {{a divorce}} as {{unavoidable}} and, on March 13, 1914, her marriage was officially dissolved, an action then confirmed by an edict issued by Nicholas II on July 15, 1914. Maria left her son behind in Sweden under his father's custody. He was raised primarily by his paternal grandmother <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> mother rarely {{in the years}} thereafter. In an interview as an adult, Lennart said his mother had a distant relationship with him.|$|E
25|$|The Games {{continued}} to grow, attracting 2,504 competitors, to Stockholm in 1912, including the great all-rounder Jim Thorpe, who won both the decathlon and pentathlon. Thorpe had previously played a few games of baseball for a fee, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> medals stripped for this breach of amateurism after complaints from Avery Brundage. They were reinstated in 1983, 30 {{years after his}} death. The Games at Stockholm {{were the first to}} fulfill Pierre de Coubertin's original idea. For {{the first time since the}} Games started in 1896 were all five inhabited continents represented with athletes competing in the same stadium.|$|E
25|$|With Cyril Connolly and Peter Watson Spender co-founded Horizon {{magazine}} {{and served as}} its editor from 1939 to 1941. From 1947 till 1949 {{he went to the}} USA several times <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> friends Auden and Isherwood. He was editor of Encounter magazine from 1953 to 1966, but resigned after it emerged that the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which published the magazine, was being covertly funded by the CIA. Spender always insisted that he was unaware of the ultimate source of Encounters funds. Spender taught at various American institutions, accepting the Elliston Chair of Poetry at the University of Cincinnati in 1954. In 1961 he became professor of rhetoric at Gresham College, London.|$|E

25|$|In March 1909, Roose {{travelled}} with Wales to play Ireland in a British Home Championship match. He {{appeared at}} Liverpool station {{with one hand}} heavily bandaged, telling the waiting press that he had broken two fingers but would nevertheless play in the match. Roose's Welsh team-mate Billy Meredith, suspecting trickery, peered through the keyhole of the goalkeeper's hotel room soon after their arrival in Belfast <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> friend remove the bandage and wiggle his fingers {{with no sign of}} discomfort. News of Roose's disability having spread through the city, a huge and expectant crowd turned out next day in the hope of witnessing an Irish victory. Instead Wales won the game 3–2, Roose himself playing superbly.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, Stewart {{was awarded}} the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and {{received}} his fifth and final Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, {{for his role in}} the 1959 Otto Preminger film Anatomy of a Murder. This courtroom drama stars Stewart as Paul Biegler, the lawyer of a hot-tempered soldier (played by Ben Gazzara) who claims temporary insanity after murdering a tavern owner who raped his wife. The film featured a career-making performance by George C. Scott as the prosecutor. The film was considered quite explicit for its time, and it was a box-office success. Stewart's nomination was one of seven for the film (Charlton Heston was the winner with Ben-Hur), <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> transition into the final decades of his career.|$|E
25|$|Concurrently, {{the main}} {{opposition}} party, the conservative People's Alliance (AP), {{was suffering from}} a profound internal crisis since the 1986 election which had seen the break up of the People's Coalition and the resignation of party leader Manuel Fraga. His successor, Antonio Hernández Mancha, proved unable to improve AP's electoral fortunes <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> political credibility decimated after an unsuccessful vote of no confidence on the government of Felipe González in March 1987. Hernández Mancha ended up quitting in early 1989, with Fraga returning as a caretaker leader who oversaw the merging of AP with its former allies, the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and the Liberal Party (PL), into the new People's Party (PP). Intending his national leadership as temporary, Fraga appointed a then-unknown President of Castile and León José María Aznar as his successor.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} Test of the series, Broad reached his maiden Test century at Lord's. Coming to the crease at 102–7, he scored 169 {{and put on}} a 332-run {{partnership}} with fellow centurion Jonathan Trott; a world record for an eight-wicket partnership. It was his first century in all forms of cricket since an under-19's match for Leicestershire <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> name go on the Lord's batting honours board, a feat that his father never achieved. He also surpassed his father's Test best of 162, and they became the first father and son both to score centuries for England in Test match cricket. His efforts both with the bat and with the ball (he also took three wickets during the match and made a direct-hit run out) earned him the man of the match award.|$|E
25|$|Within a year, Smith {{reached the}} rank of {{corporal}} <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> first action during the Pine Ridge Campaign. On January 1, 1891, {{two days after the}} Battle at Wounded Knee Creek, he accompanied a fifty-three man escort of a U.S. Army supply train to the regiment's camp at the battle site. While preparing to cross the White River, partially ice-covered during the winter, the supply train was suddenly attacked by a group of approximately 300 Sioux braves. In an attempt to save the wagon train, he and Sergeant Frederick Myers chose advanced positions from a knoll 300 yards from the river and held back the initial Sioux assault with four other troopers successfully defended their position against repeated enemy attacks. After they had withdrawn, Smith and the others chased after the war party for a considerable distance before breaking off their pursuit.|$|E
25|$|In 1869, the twenty-three year-old Cody met Ned Buntline, {{who later}} {{published}} a story based on Cody's adventures (largely invented by the writer) in Street and Smith's New York Weekly and then published {{a highly successful}} novel, Buffalo Bill, King of the Bordermen, which was first serialized {{on the front page}} of the Chicago Tribune, beginning that December 15. Many other sequels followed by Buntline, Prentiss Ingraham and others from the 1870s through the early part of the twentieth century. Cody later became world-famous for Buffalo Bill's Wild West, a touring show which traveled around the United States, Great Britain and Europe. Audiences were enthusiastic about seeing a piece of the American West. Emilio Salgari, a noted Italian writer of adventure stories, met Buffalo Bill when he came to Italy <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> show; Salgari later featured Cody as a hero in some of his novels.|$|E
