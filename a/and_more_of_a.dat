5|$|In {{mid-19th century}} America, the Wesleyan holiness {{movement}} began to teach that entire sanctification was less a process <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> state that one entered into by faith at a definite moment in time. This second blessing, {{as it was}} commonly called, allowed Christians to be freed from the power of sin. Among adherence of the holiness movement, baptism in the Holy Spirit was synonymous with second blessing sanctification.|$|E
5|$|Ochs's {{drinking}} {{became more}} <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> problem, and his behavior became increasingly erratic. He frightened his friends both with his drunken rants about the FBI and CIA, {{and about his}} claiming to want to have Elvis's manager Colonel Tom Parker or Kentucky Fried Chicken's Colonel Sanders manage his career.|$|E
5|$|The Black Cat Bar or Black Cat Café was {{a bar in}} San Francisco, California. It {{originally}} {{opened in}} 1906 and closed in 1921. The Black Cat re-opened in 1933 and operated for another 30 years. During its second run of operation, it was a hangout for Beats and bohemians but over time began attracting more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gay clientele.|$|E

25|$|Urban Renewal {{has played}} {{a great deal in}} the {{neighborhood}} of Mattapan. Then Boston Mayor Thomas Menino put these projects into place in 2006.

5|$|By 1420, James's {{standing}} at Henry V's court improved greatly; he {{ceased to be}} regarded as a hostage <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> guest. James's value to Henry became apparent in 1420 when he accompanied the English king to France where his presence was used against the Scots fighting on the Dauphinist side. Following the English success at the siege of Melun, a town southeast of Paris, the contingent of Scots were hanged for treason against their king. James attended Catherine of Valois's coronation on 23 February 1421 and was honoured by sitting immediately on the queen's left at the coronation banquet. In March, Henry began a circuit of the important towns in England as a show of strength and it was during this tour that James was knighted on Saint George's day. By July, the two kings were back campaigning in France where James, evidently approving of Henry's methods of kingship, seemed content to endorse the English king's desire for the French crown. Henry appointed the Duke of Bedford and James as the joint commanders of the siege of Dreux on 18 July 1421 and on 20 August they received the surrender of the garrison. Henry died of dysentery on 31 August 1422 and in September James was part of the escort taking the English king's body back to London.|$|E
5|$|Eddie Izzard as {{the voice}} of Reepicheep, a swashbuckling mouse. Over 100 actors auditioned to voice the character. Izzard {{approached}} Reepicheep as less camp <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bloodthirsty assassin with a sense of honour (a cross between Mad Max and a Stormtrooper from Star Wars): Izzard interpreted Reepicheep as someone whose family was killed by the Telmarines. The Narnia series were some of the few books Izzard read as a child, and he cherished them. When discussing Reepicheep to the animators, Adamson told them to rent as many Errol Flynn films as possible. Adamson credits Izzard for making the role his own; beforehand, the director was approaching the character similarly to Puss in Boots in Shrek 2.|$|E
5|$|Orci and Kurtzman {{also worked}} {{together}} as executive producers on the animated television series, , {{due to their}} involvement with the live action movies. Following {{the end of the}} series they were hopeful to be involved in a future animated series based on the premise, which Orci saw less like a reboot of the show <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> continuation in a different guise. He felt that while Prime was sophisticated, there were concerns that it was leaving younger viewers behind because of its complexity and intensity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{match is}} {{looked forward to}} by young and old, male <b>and</b> female <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{occasion}} for the old boys and present students of both schools.

5|$|These films {{took many}} liberties {{from the book}} series casting-wise. Red-haired Granville's {{portrayal}} of the then-blonde Nancy was portrayed to be ditzy, absent-minded, and more meddling that that of the ongoing book series. While the Carson Drew of the books was portrayed as older, feeble, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hands-off parent, John Litel's Carson was young and handsome, much more athletically fit, and tried his best to restrain Nancy from getting into danger. Ned/Ted was even more drastically altered: instead of being Nancy's boyfriend in college {{who lives in a}} different town, he was now her next-door neighbor, who was a year older than her and their romance was very ambiguous and tumultuous. The recurring character of the older Hannah Gruen was replaced with Effie Schneider, a minor character in the books who was Hannah's teenage niece. Effie and Hannah's characteristics were merged, although Effie's fidgety, frightful nature retained prominence for comedic effect. In addition to these four, a new character Captain Tweedy was added, to portray the stereotypical bumbling, clueless cop that mirrored Steve McBride in the Torchy Blane series. Nancy's friends Bess and George did not appear in the film series, and never mentioned or referred to.|$|E
5|$|Under {{head coach}} Brent Sutter, the team adopted {{less of a}} trap <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transitional, {{aggressive}} forechecking style of play which also emphasized puck possession and instilled the cycle to start the 2007–08 season. This led to many high scoring games {{early in the season}} for New Jersey. The Devils went on to score 244 goals in the 2008–09 season, the most the team had scored in eight seasons. However, with the return of Lemaire as head coach, the Devils resumed a more defense-oriented playing style, scoring just 222 goals and allowing only 191, an NHL best in the 2009–10 season, earning Martin Brodeur his fifth William M. Jennings Trophy.|$|E
5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made {{without a lot of}} resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as we {{have done in the past}}... I wanted to try and take everything we have done in the past and put it to the side.|$|E

2500|$|Tenace {{advocates a}} more {{aggressive}} approach to hitting. Under his guidance, hitters spend less time working the count <b>and</b> <b>more</b> time preparing to hit. He stresses the mental part of hitting, such as the mental preparation for what a pitcher will do, rather than just the physical aspect. Under Tenace, the philosophy of hitting {{can be described as}} [...] "Grip It And Rip It" [...] <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old school approach to hitting.|$|R
25|$|Once {{the market}} begins to fall {{regularly}} (a bear market), some investors may expect further losing days and refrain from buying (positive feedback—reinforcing the fall), but others may buy because stocks become more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bargain (negative feedback—stabilizing the fall, see also contrarian investing).|$|E
25|$|In 1945, as the Japanese were {{defeated}} and Vietnam {{fell into a}} power vacuum, Sổ ordered the creation of armed units for campaigns against the local administration, landowners and French colonial forces. This led to the Hòa Hảo becoming less of a religious <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> military-political movement, as people such as landowners converted {{in the hope that}} they could buy protection.|$|E
25|$|In 19th century farm settings, {{children}} were {{an important part}} of their families' agricultural livelihoods. As industrialization occurred and families shifted from rural agricultural settings to urban ones, the number of children per household also declined. Children became less of an economic benefit <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cost: urban life necessitated educating children which was costly.|$|E

50|$|Cobra {{reformed}} in 1999 {{and released}} a new album, simply entitled Cobra. Yosu-ko and Naoki {{were the only}} members to return from the previous lineup; Yosu-ko handled the bass duties as well as vocals, and the two were joined by drummer Yoshiro. This album represented a departure in the band's sound compared to their 80's/early 90's work, with generally quieter guitars, less <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emphasis on sing-along choruses, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> overall alternative rock feel.|$|R
25|$|The fourth {{series was}} retitled The Kenny Everett Video Cassette <b>and</b> was <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comedy {{programme}} {{than the previous}} three series, which relied more on music acts.|$|R
25|$|Less of {{a drastic}} step <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> natural {{progression}} {{from the previous}} album, the critical reception of the album was mostly positive. The inclusion of a keyboard (played by the multi-talented Nicholas Horne) was particularly praised for adding a new depth to the Howards Alias sound. Some older fans, however, were alienated by the step even further away from the original ska-punk roots of the band.|$|E
25|$|In 1777, the Tây Sơn {{brothers}} attacked Saigon {{and eliminated}} {{almost the entire}} Nguyễn Dynasty, with the fifteen-year-old Nguyễn Ánh managing to escape into the far south. He took refuge at Pigneau's seminary from September to October before both were forced to flee to the island of Pulo Panjang in the Gulf of Siam. The move was a political step taken by Pigneau to align himself with Nguyễn Ánh, allowing himself a foray into politics. He became less of a missionary <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> politician thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The plan envisioned that Requeté {{becomes less}} of a {{scouting}} group <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> paramilitary organization. Lloréns, reporting to political Carlist leader Bartolomé Feliú Pérez (marqués de Cerralbo after 1912) and Don Jaime himself, strived to build a nationwide network; most effective in Catalonia, he wrote regulations for local and comarca units, nominated provincial and regional leaders, and set up Junta Central Tradicionalista Organizadora de los Requetés de Cataluña. His intention was to bring more experienced military staff into the organization, so that under their command it could form local combat units capable of staging military action for the Carlist cause, should the opportunity arise.|$|E
25|$|The {{scholar who}} {{is best known}} for {{developing}} the mere-exposure effect is Robert Zajonc. Before conducting his research, he observed that exposure to a novel stimulus initially elicits a fear/avoidance response by all organisms. Each repeated exposure to the novel stimulus causes less fear <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> approach tactic by the observing organism. After repeated exposure, the observing organism will begin to react fondly to the once novel stimulus. This observation led to the research and development of the mere-exposure effect.|$|R
50|$|Contrasting the {{functional}} modeling, {{another type of}} systems modeling is architectural modeling which uses the systems architecture to conceptually model the structure, behavior, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> views <b>of</b> <b>a</b> system.|$|R
50|$|Early portraits, {{almost always}} {{full-length}} (judges at the bench being the main exception), had <b>a</b> stronger element <b>of</b> caricature and usually distorted {{the proportions of}} the body, with a very large head and upper body supported on much smaller lower parts. Later, as he became socially accepted in the society in which he moved {{to gain access to}} his subjects, and not wishing to cause offence, his style developed into what he called 'characteristic portraits', being less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> caricature <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> actual portrait <b>of</b> the subject, using realistic body proportions.|$|R
25|$|Though Britpop {{is viewed}} as a {{marketing}} tool, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cultural moment than a musical style or genre, there are musical conventions and influences the bands grouped under the Britpop term have in common, such as showing elements from the British pop music of the Sixties, glam rock and punk rock of the Seventies, and indie pop of the Eighties in their music. Britpop was a media driven focus on bands which emerged from the independent music scene of the early 1990s—and was associated with the British popular cultural movement of Cool Britannia which evoked the Swinging Sixties and the British guitar pop music of that decade.|$|E
25|$|Another Aquaman ongoing {{series with}} {{creative}} team Shaun McLaughlin and Ken Hooper (#1–13) thereafter ran from December 1991 to December 1992, which portrayed Aquaman reluctantly deciding {{to remain in}} Poseidonis as its protector once again. For a time, he serves as Atlantis' representative to the United Nations but always finds himself thrust back into the superhero role. Becoming more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> workaholic and solitary figure, Aquaman eventually returns to the oceans. He soon becomes tangled up in another attempt by Black Manta to destroy Atlantis by dragging it into a war with a surface nation.|$|E
25|$|Over time, people {{experience}} increasing difficulty moving, swallowing (dysphagia), and speaking or forming words (dysarthria). Symptoms of upper motor neuron involvement include tight and stiff muscles (spasticity) and exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia) including an overactive gag reflex. An abnormal reflex commonly called Babinski's sign also indicates upper motor neuron damage. Symptoms of lower motor neuron degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy, muscle cramps, and fleeting twitches of muscles {{that can be}} seen under the skin (fasciculations) although twitching is not a diagnostic symptom <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> side effect so twitching would either occur after or accompany weakness and atrophy.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Globalization here is {{understood}} to be a multicentric, multiscalar, multitemporal, multiform, and multicausal process, which has much less <b>of</b> <b>an</b> explanans <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> explanandum. In recent analysis globalization {{has been found to}} be about place, space, and scale. Yet, following its title, this paper argues that it is about time too. In other words, globalization is also a spatio-temporal process. The nature of this process, its relation with the development of capitalist economiesand the role of the state, are at the core of this paper. ...|$|R
2500|$|The new flipper {{ushered in}} the [...] "golden age" [...] of pinball, where the fierce {{competition}} between the various pinball manufacturers led to constant innovation in the field. Various types of stationary and moving targets were added, spinning scoring reels replaced games featuring static scores lit from behind. Multiplayer scores were added soon after, and then bells and other noise-makers, all of which began to make pinball less <b>a</b> game <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> experience. The flippers have loaned pinball its common name in many languages, where the game is known mainly as [...] "flipper".|$|R
