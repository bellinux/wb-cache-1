As he enjoys his summer working on papers for Cambridge {{societies}} and composing his poetry, Brooke leads {{a social life}} flirting with various women and enjoying the company of artists <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>students.</b> Brooke soon lusts for Nell, and his increased interest in her leads to unconventional encounters. They develop a friendship in which both Nell and Brooke hold secret admiration and love for the other, but are unable to express it because of social conventions. Brooke also desires to lose his virginity because he feels that being a virgin is disgraceful. Because he cannot convince Nell or any of several other women to succumb to his wooing, he loses it in a homosexual encounter with a boyhood friend, Denham Russell-Smith.|$|E

25|$|In September 1860, a Milwaukee-bound steamship, the Lady Elgin, sank off {{the coast}} of the campus in stormy weather after colliding with a schooner. Despite being the second-deadliest {{accident}} on the Great Lakes, Edward Spencer '62 <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>students</b> from the Garrett Bible Institute were credited with rescuing dozens of passengers. Following a public outcry over life-saving facilities and transportation safety, in 1871, the federal government granted the University a lifeboat and later, in 1876, constructed a life-saving station, both of which were manned and operated by students, near the Grosse Point reef and lighthouse. By the time the Coast Guard assumed control of the station in 1916, it had remained the nation's only student-manned life-saving station; Northwestern students were credited with saving more than 400 people.|$|E

25|$|After {{his father}} {{received}} a rabbinic appointment, the Ansbacher {{family moved to}} Wiesbaden in 1925, where Joseph attended the Staatliche Gymnasium. When the Nazis took power in Germany in January 1933, {{he was one of}} only seven Jews in a student body of around 600, and the only Jew in his class. He endured three years of harassment including an antisemitic insult carved into the top of his desk, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>students</b> singing popular songs calling for the murder of the Jews. In 1936, all Jewish students were expelled from the public schools, and his parents sent him to the Talmud Torah school in Hamburg, led by Rabbi Joseph Carlebach, where he graduated in spring, 1938. Among the frequent guest lecturers in his senior year was Martin Buber.|$|E
25|$|Umbridge's {{tenure at}} Hogwarts is characterised by cruelty and abusive punishments against students; she forces Harry Potter, Lee Jordan <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>students</b> {{to whom she}} gave {{detention}} to write lines using a blood quill, which cuts the same words written into its victims as they write. Umbridge even attempts to use Veritaserum and the Cruciatus Curse to extract information from students. By speaking derisively to a herd of centaurs, she provokes them and they abduct her. Umbridge is later rescued by Dumbledore, not visibly harmed but traumatised, and is eventually removed from Hogwarts due to the wizarding community pressuring Fudge for his resignation. She later makes a short appearance in Half-Blood Prince when she attends Dumbledore's funeral with an unconvincing expression of grief and Harry is disgusted to hear that Rufus Scrimgeour has continued to employ her at the Ministry of Magic.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the dispute}} on whether Jeong should die or not was the sole, {{or even the}} most influential, cause of the split. The {{students}} of Jo Sik had suffered terrible damages by Jeong Yeorip's purge, while the followers of Yi Hwang had not lost anyone. Moreover, Yu Seongryong, the most influential of Yi Hwang's students, retained {{a close relationship with}} Jeong Cheol, who led the purge. Thus, Jo sik's students wanted to kill Jeong Cheol more than Yu Seongryong <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>students</b> of Yi Hwang did. Another cause for division was that Jeong Inhong, the most favored student of Jo Sik, had a contempt for Yi Hwang and his pupils, who formed {{a large part of the}} Easterners. These differences within the Easterner camp led to the followers of Yi Hwang becoming largely Southerners, while the followers of Jo Sik became largely Northerners.|$|E

25|$|In the 1930s, {{she began}} {{studying}} modern art through learning {{the components of}} composition, technique, and theory. This initial investigation into modern art formed her work {{throughout the rest of}} her career. She began taking classes from Hans Hofmann in 1937, which modernized her approach to the nude and still life. He emphasized the two-dimensional nature of the picture plane and usage of color to create spatial illusion that was not representative of reality through his lessons. Throughout her classes with Hofmann, Krasner worked in an advanced style of cubism, also known as neo-cubism. During the class, a human nude or a still life setting would be the model from which Krasner <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>students</b> would have to work. She typically created charcoal drawings of the human models and oil on paper color studies of the still life settings. She typically illustrated female nudes in a cubist manner with tension achieved through the fragmentation of forms and the opposition of light and dark colors. The still lifes illustrated her interest in fauvism since she suspended brightly colored pigment on white backgrounds.|$|E

500|$|On {{his arrival}} in Japan, Rossier presumably {{introduced}} himself as a photographer despatched to Japan by Negretti and Zambra, perhaps thereby inspiring a misconception, for while he remained in the country he was {{often referred to as}} an [...] "English" [...] photographer.

With Maeda <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>students</b> escorting him around the city, Rossier took photographs of priests, beggars, the audience of a sumo match, the foreign settlement, and the group portrait of Alexander von Siebold and samurai. Rossier believed that Pompe van Meerdervoort's failures in photography were {{due to a lack of}} the necessary chemicals and so he provided Maeda with a letter of recommendation to procure photographic apparatus and chemicals from a source in Shanghai. Both Maeda and Furukawa bought lenses, chemicals and albumen paper through Rossier.|$|E
500|$|At 13, he {{enrolled}} in the Lakeside School, a private preparatory school. [...] When {{he was in the}} eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the school's students. [...] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, [...] "There was just something neat about the machine." [...] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>students</b> sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.|$|E
