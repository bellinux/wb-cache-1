[...] Stable value funds are often made available in these plans under a name that intends to describe the nature of the fund (such as capital preservation fund, fixed-interest fund, capital <b>accumulation</b> <b>fund,</b> principal protection fund, guaranteed fund, preservation fund, or income fund among others). [...] They offer principal preservation, predictable returns, and a rate higher than similar options without proportionately increasing risk. [...] The funds are structured in various ways, but in general they are composed of high quality, diversified fixed income portfolios that are protected against interest rate volatility by contracts from banks and insurance companies. For example, a stable value fund may hold highly rated government or corporate debt, asset-backed securities, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and cash equivalents. [...] Stable value funds are designed to preserve principal while providing steady, positive returns, and are considered one of the lowest risk investment options offered in 401(k) plans. [...] Stable value funds have recently been returning an annualized average of 2.72% as of October 2014, higher than the 0.08% offered by money-market funds, and are offered in 165,000 retirement plans.|$|E

This approach focuses on maximizing growth of the <b>accumulation</b> <b>fund</b> in the initial years and preserving its value in the later years. This paper simulates terminal wealth outcomes under conventional lifecycle asset allocation rules as well as those given by contrarian strategies that reverse the direction of the switching of assets. Our evidence suggests that the general increase in portfolio size as one approaches retirement is significant from an asset allocation perspective. Due to this portfolio size effect, we find the terminal value of accumulation in retirement account to be critically dependent on the asset allocation strategy adopted by the participant in later years (relative to earlier years). By investing conservatively in such crucial phase, lifecycle strategies recommended by financial advisors sacrifice significant growth opportunity and prove counterproductive to the participant’s wealth accumulation objective.

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the problem of}} reciprocal relations between income {{on the one hand}} and consumption and accumulation on the other in private farms keeping business accounts. The analysis reveals that the level of income exerts influence on consumption and accumulation. The level of the latter two competitive values is influenced by the level of income. I particular, the cosumption fund is slower to react to changes of income than the <b>accumulation</b> <b>fund.</b> Generally, the proportions of the distribution of income depend on the hitherto existing level of consumption, the prospects of its increase and the profitability of agricultural production. The level of consumption and accumulation in particular groups of farms is shaped by the forms of intensification. In small farms employing labour- -consuming methods of production the inclination for accumulation is weaker than in larger farms applying capita-consuming methods. Besides, the smallest farms are less immune to crises; in consequence, the crises contribute to a further weakening of their productive activity. In such a situation the differences between the levels of accumulation in the smallest farms and in other groups of farms increase, whereas the respective differences referring to consumption decrease.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the Chinese housing {{reforms of the}} 1990 s {{in the context of}} the previous system and assesses their impact. The PRC housing system evolved gradually from 1949 onwards. Described as a "work unit welfare-in-kind housing provision system", it was widely perceived as having fundamental flaws and was targeted for reform from 1978 onwards. Following a period of protracted experimentation from 1978 to 1990, the Chinese government launched a new wave of comprehensive housing reforms from the beginning of the 1990 s. The four key early measures were: rent increases, the sale of public housing, the creation of the Housing <b>Accumulation</b> <b>Fund,</b> and the development of Economic and Practical Housing. However, these changes had only limited impact, and a new policy, monetised housing provision, was introduced in the late 1990 s, along with a series of ancillary policies. This aimed to prohibit the allocation of housing to employees by work units, directing them instead to provide a cash allowance as part of wages; employees were directed to purchase or rent accommodation in the market. This was intended to speed up the process towards a market economy in the housing sector. The fact that housing reforms have such a major impact on all urban families makes them extremely sensitive. At the same time, reforms in other areas of the economy are dependent on the successful implementation of housing reforms. This thesis analyses the impact of the reforms and assesses how far they have succeeded in making fundamental changes to the housing provision system...|$|E

The Prudent Equity Fund that {{targeted}} equity investors with a low risk appetite and desired stable, recurring dividend income; 2. The Balanced Equity Fund that targeted equity investors with a moderate risk appetite and expected a combination of dividend income and capital gains; and 3. The Wealth <b>Accumulation</b> <b>Fund</b> that targeted equity investors with a high risk appetite focussing on total returns. These investors were indifferent between dividend income and capital gains and also wanted an exposure to overseas markets. To enable unit selection, the case provides information on the operating and financial performance, the unit prices and distributions of the four Singapore REITs, {{as well as the}} underlying macroeconomic drivers. As of November 2016, there were over thirty REITs listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX). Singapore listed REITs have a sector focus i. e. their portfolios consisted almost exclusively of assets from one of the following sub-markets – residential, retail, industrial, office, healthcare and hospitality. The REITs chosen in this case study comprise the largest REITs in the retail (CMT), industrial (A-REIT) and healthcare (P-Life REIT sectors, and an industrial REIT whose operating and financial performance is weak (Soilbuild REIT), to enable the class to get an exposure to retail, industrial and healthcare REITs and distinguish REITs with weaker business and financial profiles from stronger ones.

It is shown that <b>accumulation</b> of <b>funds</b> in accumulative pension system (APS) requires complex calculations. A model for <b>accumulation</b> of <b>funds</b> in the accumulative pension insurance system used in this paper makes it possible to determine a set of interrelated parameters – insurance premium rates, reasonable insurance periods, the desired rates of profitability, the required amount of savings, investment potential of accumulative pension system, etc. The amount of funds in accumulative pension insurance system depends not only on the basis of insurance (number of payers of insurance premiums), the amount of contributions (rate and object) and (primarily) on the term of beginning of payments of insurance premiums, the coefficient of profitability of invested funds and guarantees of their safety at all stages of functioning of the accumulative system. The analysis has shown that it is necessary: to cover all people employed in the economy with accumulative pension insurance; a rate of contributions should be determined not only by wages, but also by income; prior to the introduction of accumulative pension system – to create the necessary infrastructure, to develop a legal framework, to organize the management of accumulative funds, to solve the issues related to the protection of funds from the risks of losses.
