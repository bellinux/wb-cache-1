40|$|Objective To analyse {{hospital}} admissions in {{the first}} 2 years of life among children with cleft lip and/or palate in England. Design Analysis of national administrative data of hospital admissions. Setting National Health Service hospitals. Patients Patients born alive between 1997 and 2008 who underwent surgical cleft repair. Outcome measures Number of admissions, including the birth episode, and days spent in hospital were examined. Children were analysed according to cleft type {{and whether or not}} they had additional congenital anomalies. Results 10 892 children were included. In their first 2 years, children without additional anomalies (n= 8482) had on average 3. 2 <b>admissions</b> <b>and</b> 13. 2 days in hospital, which varied from 2. 6 <b>admissions</b> <b>and</b> 9. 2 days with cleft lip to 4. 7 <b>admissions</b> <b>and</b> 19. 7 days with bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP). Children with additional anomalies (n= 2410) had on average 6. 7 <b>admissions</b> <b>and</b> 51. 4 days in hospital, which varied from 6. 4 <b>admissions</b> <b>and</b> 48. 5 days with cleft palate to 8. 8 <b>admissions</b> <b>and</b> 67. 5 days with BCLP. The mean number and duration of cleft-related admissions was similar in children without (1. 6 <b>admissions</b> <b>and</b> 6. 4 days) and in those with additional anomalies (1. 5 <b>admissions</b> <b>and</b> 8. 5 days). 35. 2 % of children without additional anomalies had at least one emergency admission, whereas the corresponding figure was 67. 3 % with additional anomalies. Conclusions The burden of hospital care {{in the first}} 2 years of life varied according to cleft type and presence of additional anomalies. However, cleft-specific hospital care did not differ between children with and without additional anomalies...|$|R

5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones {{can be measured in}} the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital <b>admission</b> <b>and</b> potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E

5|$|The various nicknames {{associated}} with prepatellar bursitis {{arise from the}} fact that it commonly occurs among those individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling, such as carpenters, carpet layers, gardeners, housemaids, mechanics, miners, plumbers, and roofers.

Prepatellar bursitis is more common among males than females. It affects all age groups, but is more likely to be septic when it occurs in children.|$|E

5|$|University {{governance}} {{is conducted}} through the Board of Governors and the Senate, {{both of which}} were given much of their present power in the Unofficial Consolidation of an Act for the Regulation and Support of Dalhousie College in Chapter 24 of the Acts of 1863. This statute replaced ones from 1820, 1823, 1838, 1841 and 1848, and has since been supplemented 11 times, most recently in 1995. The Board is responsible for conduct, management, and control of the university and of its property, revenues, business, and affairs. Board members, known as Governors of the Board, include the university's chancellor, president, and 25 other members. Members include people from within the university community such as four approved representatives from Dalhousie Student Union, and those in the surrounding community, such as the Mayor of Halifax.

5|$|Colross, (also {{historically}} {{known as}} Belle Air and Grasshopper Hall), is a Georgian mansion in Princeton, New Jersey; {{it was built}} {{as the center of}} an estate in the Old Town neighborhood of Alexandria, Virginia. Colross is currently the administration building of Princeton Day School. The Colross property originally occupied the entire 1100 block of Oronoco Street; Alexandria merchant John Potts developed it as a plantation and began building the mansion in 17991800. In 1803, Jonathan Swift—also an Alexandria merchant and a city councilman—purchased the property and during his ownership continued constructing the mansion. After Swift's death in 1824, Colross was purcheased by Thomson Francis Mason (1785–1838), son of Thomson Mason (1759–1820) and grandson of Founding Father George Mason (1725–1792) of Gunston Hall. Mason served as a judge of the Criminal Court of the District of Columbia and as mayor of Alexandria. During his ownership, Mason made Colross his chief homestead; he substantially modified and added to the mansion. After successive ownerships, the area around Colross became heavily industrialized. The mansion was bought by John Munn in 1929; between that year and 1932 it was transported brick-by-brick to Princeton, where in 1958 it was sold to Princeton Day School, which uses it as a school administration building housing its <b>admission</b> <b>and</b> advancement offices.|$|E

5|$|The Madchester {{scene of}} the 1980s, from which groups {{including}} New Order, The Smiths, The Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, 808 State, James and The Charlatans emerged, was based on clubs such as the world-famous The Haçienda. The period {{was the subject of}} the film 24 Hour Party People. Many of the big clubs suffered problems with organised crime at that time; Haslam describes one where staff were so completely intimidated that free <b>admission</b> <b>and</b> drinks were demanded (and given) and drugs were openly dealt. Following a series of drug-related violent incidents, The Hacienda closed in 1998. In 1988, Manchester was often referred to as Madchester for its rave scene. Owned by Tony Wilson's Factory Records, it was given the catalogue number FAC51 and official club name, FAC51 The Hacienda. Known for developing many talented 1980s influential acts, it also influenced the graphic design industry via Factory artists such as Peter Saville (PSA), Octavo (8vo), Central Design Station, etc. The memorabilia from this club holds a high value among collectors and fans of these artists and the club. Peter Saville was most notable for his minimalistic influence that still affects contemporary graphic design everywhere.|$|E
5|$|The house {{seems to}} have been rebuilt since the time that Sir Samuel Morland dwelt in it. About the year 1730, Mr. Jonathan Tyers became the {{occupier}} of it, and, there being a large garden belonging to it, planted with a great number of stately trees, and laid out in shady walks, it obtained the name of Spring Gardens; and the house being converted into a tavern, or place of entertainment, was much frequented by the votaries of pleasure. Mr. Tyers opened it with an advertisement of a Ridotto al Fresco, a term which {{the people of this country}} had till that time been strangers to. These entertainments were repeated in the course of the summer, and numbers resorted to partake of them. This encouraged the proprietor to make his garden a place of musical entertainment, for every evening during the summer season. To this end he was at great expense in decorating the gardens with paintings; he engaged a band of excellent musicians; he issued silver tickets at one guinea each for <b>admission,</b> <b>and</b> receiving great encouragement, he set up an organ in the orchestra, and, in a conspicuous part of the garden, erected a fine statue of Mr. Handel.|$|E
