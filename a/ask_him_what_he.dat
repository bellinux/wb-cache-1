500|$|Barrett had one noted {{reunion with}} the members of Pink Floyd, in 1975 during the {{recording}} sessions for Wish You Were Here. He attended the Abbey Road session unannounced, and watched the band working on the final mix of [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" [...] — a song that happened to be about him. By that time, the 29-year-old Barrett had become quite overweight, had shaved off all of his hair (including his eyebrows), and his former bandmates did not initially recognise him. Barrett's behaviour at the session was erratic; he spent part of the session brushing his teeth. Roger Waters finally managed to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought of the song and he simply said that it [...] "sounds a bit old". He briefly attended the reception for Gilmour's wedding to Ginger that immediately followed the recording sessions; however, he left early without exchanging goodbyes with the newlyweds.|$|E
500|$|Days after Buckner joined Bragg, both Bragg and Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith {{began an}} {{invasion}} of Kentucky. As Bragg pushed north, his first encounter was in Buckner's home town of Munfordville. The small town was important for Union forces to hold {{if they wanted to}} maintain communication with Louisville while pressing [...] southward to Bowling Green and Nashville. A small force under the command of Col. John T. Wilder guarded the town. Though vastly outnumbered, Wilder refused requests to surrender on September 12and September 14. By September 17, however, Wilder recognized his difficult position and asked Bragg for proof of the superior numbers he claimed. In an unusual move, Wilder agreed to be blindfolded and brought to Buckner. When he arrived, he told Buckner that he (Wilder) was not a military man and had come to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> should do. Flattered, Buckner showed Wilder the strength and position of the Confederate forces, which outnumbered Wilder's men almost 5-to-1. Seeing the hopeless situation he was in, Wilder informed Buckner that he wanted to surrender. Any other course, he later explained, would be [...] "no less than willful murder." ...|$|E

2500|$|Noting that [...] calls Noah [...] "a man," [...] a Midrash {{taught that}} {{wherever}} Scripture employs the term [...] "a man," [...] it indicates a righteous man who warned his generation. The Midrash taught that for 120 years (deduced from [...] ), Noah planted cedars and cut them down. When they would <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing, he would reply that God had {{informed him that}} God was bringing a flood. Noah's contemporaries replied that if a flood did come, it would come only on Noah's father's house. Rabbi Abba taught that God said that one herald arose for God in the generation of the Flood — Noah. But they despised him and called him a contemptible old man.|$|E

2500|$|The Chofetz Chaim told {{a parable}} {{to explain the}} {{teaching}} of Rav Judah (see [...] "In classical rabbinic interpretation": [...] "Exodus chapter 34" [...] above) that God would not turn Jews away empty-handed when they recite the 13 attributes of God in [...] The Chofetz Chaim told that {{there was once a}} wealthy businessman whose poor nephew pleaded with him for a job. The businessman gave the nephew a job, and wrote out a list of tasks describing the nephew's responsibilities. The businessman exhorted the nephew to review the list every day. After a while, the businessman summoned his nephew to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing for the business. The nephew said that he had done everything that the businessman had asked. The businessman pressed the nephew for details. The nephew replied that every day, he recited the list of tasks that the businessman gave him and remembered the list by heart. The businessman asked whether the nephew had done any of the tasks. The nephew answered sheepishly that he thought that since his uncle was the boss, it would be enough for him simply to repeat the list aloud. The businessman called the nephew a fool and explained that the list was only to remind the nephew what to do. Similarly, taught the Chofetz Chaim, the 13 attributes, while given to Jews to be recited as a prayer, are fundamentally guidelines for how to walk in God's ways.|$|E

2500|$|God's {{word came}} to Ezekiel, {{telling him to}} write on one stick [...] "For Judah, and for the {{children}} of Israel his companions," [...] to write on a second stick [...] "For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and of all the house of Israel his companions," [...] and to join the two sticks together into one stick to hold in his hand. When people would <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant by these sticks, he was to tell them that God said that God would take the stick of Joseph, which was in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions, and put them together with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick in God's hand. Ezekiel was to hold the sticks in his hand for people to see, telling them that God said that God would gather the children of Israel from among the nations, wherever they had gone, bring them into their own land, and make them one nation with one king, no longer two nations with two kings. No longer would they defile themselves with idols or transgressions, but God would save them and cleanse them, so that they would be God's people, and God would be their God. David would be king over them, and they would have one shepherd and observe God's statutes. They and their children, and their children's children forever, would dwell in the land that God had given Jacob, where their fathers had dwelt, and David would be their prince forever. God would make an everlasting covenant of peace with them, multiply them, and set God's sanctuary in the midst of them forever. God's dwelling-place would be over them, God would be their God, and they would be God's people. And the nations would know that God sanctified Israel, when God's sanctuary would be in their midst forever.|$|E
