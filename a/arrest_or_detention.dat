However, there are certain exceptions which allow non-judicial detention, such as detention in order to effect an <b>arrest,</b> <b>or</b> <b>detention</b> for quarantine purposes.

[...] Re-education through labor has also been criticized by numerous human rights groups for not offering procedural guarantees for the accused, and for being used to detain political dissidents, teachers, Chinese house church leaders, and Falun Gong practitioners.

2500|$|After the Guardian {{published}} the story, the Chicago Police provided a statement saying, without specifics, {{that there is}} nothing improper taking place at what it called the “sensitive” location, home to undercover units.

If lawyers have a client detained at Homan Square, just like any other facility, they are allowed to speak to and visit them.” The Guardian said several attorneys and one Homan Square arrestee have denied this.

40|$|Police {{frequently}} encounter youth {{running away}} from home, violating curfew, skipping school, and chronically disobeying adultsmisbehavior that can often stem from family conflict and {{that do not require}} justice involvement. When alternatives are not available, however, these behaviors can lead to <b>arrests</b> <b>or</b> <b>detention.</b> Families dealing with difficult youth behavior often unwittingly send their youth into the justice system by calling the police because they feel they have nowhere to turn for help. For police, encountering these kinds of situations can be frustrating because they feel limited to suboptimal choices: either ignoring the problem behavior or criminalizing it. This brief explores the creative, collaborative, and community-focused work being done in Nevada, Connecticut, Nebraska, Michigan, Illinois, and Oregon to find productive responses to youth "acting out. "  The juvenile assessment resource centers, crisis response centers, and crisis intervention teams in these jurisdictions address the needs of youth and connect families to resources and services without the need for juvenile justice involvement...|$|R
2500|$|In two {{articles}} {{appearing in the}} Pakistani newspaper The Express Tribune, the precise status of Davis's and the American Government's claim of immunity was examined by Najmuddin Shaikh, a former Pakistani diplomat. He wrote {{that the question of}} diplomatic immunity depended on whether Davis was {{on the staff of the}} [...] "consulate" [...] or the [...] "embassy" [...] as the privileges and immunities of each are very different. Shaik wrote that if Davis was on the staff of the [...] "embassy", the question of immunity would depend upon whether Davis was in Mozang Chowrangi in the [...] "course of his duties" [...] and questioned who should decide that. Regarding the law concerning if Davis was on the [...] "consular" [...] staff, a practising lawyer in Islamabad, Mirza Shahzad Akbar, referred to the Vienna Convention of 1963 in The News International, writing: “one needs to read Article 41 (1) which says: Consular officers shall not be liable to <b>arrest</b> <b>or</b> <b>detention</b> pending trial, except in the case of a grave crime and pursuant to a decision by the competent judicial authority. Now having read the law, there should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that if a member of US Consulate in Lahore kills someone, he is answerable to a court of law in that jurisdiction, as there is no other crime more heinous or more grave than murder." [...] Pakistani investigators took the position that Davis did not shoot the two men acting in self-defence and the police recommended he face a charge of double murder.|$|E
