40|$|International audienceMost food {{packages}} and food contact materials are manufactured using adhesives. The EU regulates all food contact materials, as their constituents may not contaminate food and endanger consumer's health. In contrary to plastics which are regulated by positive lists of <b>authorised</b> <b>ingredients,</b> adhesives {{have not yet}} a specific regulation. The MIGRESIVES project wants to elaborate a scientific global risk assessment approach to meet current general EU regulatory requirements and {{as a basis for}} future specific EU legislation as well as to provide the industry, especially small and medium sized enterprises, a tool to ensure that migration from adhesives is in compliance with the regulatory requirements. The idea is to demonstrate that consumer's exposure to chemicals released by adhesives is in many cases below levels of concern. Technical/scientific knowledge from industry and research institutes will be merged into a collective research endeavour gathering all stakeholders. The major milestones are (i) classification of adhesives according to chemistry and uses, (ii) test strategies based on physico-chemical behaviour of adhesives, (iii) modelling migration/exposure from adhesives, (iv) providing guidelines to integrate the risk assessment approach into the daily life of companies, (v) feasibility of appling the toxicological approach from EU BIOSAFEPAPER project and (vi) extensive training/education to SMEs and large dissemination for general adoption of the concept in Europe...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: In some countries, nicotine-containing {{electronic}} cigarettes (e-cigarettes) {{are considered a}} consumer product without specific regulations. In others (eg, Switzerland), the sale of e-cigarettes containing nicotine is forbidden, despite the eagerness of many smokers to obtain them. As scientific data about efficacy and long-term safety of these products are scarce, tobacco control experts are divided on how to regulate them. In order to gain consensus among experts to provide recommendations to health authorities, we performed a national consensus study. SETTING: We used a Delphi method with electronic questionnaires to bring together the opinion of Swiss experts on e-cigarettes. PARTICIPANTS: 40 Swiss experts from across the country. OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured the degree of consensus between experts on recommendations regarding regulation, sale, use of and general opinion about e-cigarettes containing nicotine. New recommendations and statements were added following the experts' answers and comments. RESULTS: There was consensus that e-cigarettes containing nicotine should be made available, but only under specific conditions. Sale should be restricted to adults, using quality standards, a maximum level of nicotine and with an accompanying list of <b>authorised</b> <b>ingredients.</b> Advertisement should be restricted and use in public places should be forbidden. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations encompass three principles: (1) the reality principle, as the product is already on the market; (2) the prevention principle, as e-cigarettes provide an alternative to tobacco for actual smokers, and (3) the precautionary principle, to protect minors and non-smokers, since long-term effects are not yet known. Swiss authorities should design specific regulations to sell nicotine-containing e-cigarettes...|$|E

40|$|Objectives Retrospective {{assessment}} of environmental pesticide exposure is challenging. Exposure measurements or information on crop-specific pesticide use are often lacking historically. We applied expert assessment to reconstruct historical pesticide use {{patterns in the}} Netherlands, and evaluated reliability and accuracy of this procedure. Methods For six main crops in the Netherlands, two experts per crop individually rated the probability (percentage of farmers applying) and frequency of use of <b>authorised</b> active <b>ingredients</b> between 1961 and 2005 per 5 -year period. Inter-rater agreement was investigated by the percentage overall agreement and weighted Cohen's ?'s (κw). Experts' ratings were compared with self-reported pesticide use from recent farmer surveys to determine accuracy of the ratings. Results Inter-rater agreement on the probability of use varied between crops (κw 0. 25 to 0. 69), as well as agreement on the frequency of use (κw 0. 32 to 0. 64). Inter-rater agreement was marginally higher for herbicides and fungicides than insecticides. Comparisons with survey data indicated fair to good accuracy of the experts' ratings for the probability (κw 0. 48 to 0. 65) and frequency of use (κw 0. 38 to 0. 68). For all crops except fruit, the specificity of the experts' ratings was higher than the sensitivity. Conclusions Overall inter-rater agreement between experts was fair to good and experts' ratings were reasonably accurate. Results {{of this study indicate}} that expert assessment can be used to derive information on historical pesticide use, which is essential for epidemiological studies evaluating the effect of (past) environmental exposure to pesticides on health...|$|R
