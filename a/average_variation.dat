To estimate the subject in a stable state {{on the basis of the}} bio-physical signal in the posture movement, the conditions of vision, vestibular, somatosensory apparatus and the central nervous system (CNS) were detected. Based on the vision condition, there was a greater <b>average</b> <b>variation</b> (Vi-aAVG-MAX and Vi-aAVG-MIN) in position with eyes closed and eyes opened (PC and PO), which was 27. 11 § 6. 36 units. The vestibular condition showed a slightly larger <b>average</b> <b>variation</b> (Ve-aAVG-MAX and Ve-aAVG-MIN) in the body position with PC and PO, which was 6. 60 § 1. 65 units. The somatosensory condition demonstrated a lower <b>average</b> <b>variation</b> (So-aAVG-MAX and So-aAVG-MIN) in position with PC and PO that amounted to 3. 653 § 2. 424 units. The CNS condition was confirmed to indicate very little <b>average</b> <b>variation</b> (C-aAVG-MAX and C-aAVG-MIN) in body position with PC and PO that was at 0. 401 § 0. 56 units. As the model depends on the bio-physical transformation system of posture movement, the average values of these perturbations were computed (0. 012 Hz, range of Fourier frequency).

It {{is interesting to note that}} the macrosector that had the highest percentage variation in the period was services, with <b>average</b> <b>variation</b> of 2.91 % per year. The agricultural sector obtained an <b>average</b> <b>variation</b> of 1.98 % per year. While these two sectors had positive percentage variation, industry had a negative <b>average</b> <b>variation</b> of 1.35 % per year. The three macrosectors declined in the year after the crisis of 2008; however, services remained stagnant until the year 2012, falling in 2013, and recovering in 2014. In agriculture, a downward trend was observed until the year 2006, then recovery from 2007 until the year 2008; however, after the crisis, there was a fall until the year 2010, leading to a recovery during the following year. In contrast to services and agriculture, industry experienced periods of positive and negative variations in TFP, and after the crisis, this sector recovered until 2010, but then, industry continued to fall from 2011 until 2014.|$|E

40|$|Concepts for trajectory-based {{operations}} depend {{heavily on}} the performance of the underlying trajectory prediction capability. To address the system-level question “how good of a prediction is good enough? ” a fast-time simulation method is presented. Modeling and simulation lends itself to capturing the sensitivity of a concept’s critical performance criteria, to the performance of its supporting trajectory-prediction capability. Given the significant initial cost to develop and validate an appropriate simulation tool a characterization method is proposed to provide quicker, yet less precise results in the interim. The analysis characterizes the trajectory-prediction errors associated with key modeling options for a specific concept. Concept developers can then identify the relative sizes of trajectory prediction errors associated with key modeling options, and qualitatively determine which options would lead to the failure of their concept. The characterization method is demonstrated for a case study involving future airport surface traffic management automation. Of the four sources of error considered in this study, the <b>average</b> <b>variation</b> from the baseline trajectory associated with acceleration segments is 10 %; the <b>average</b> <b>variation</b> associated with turn modeling is 4 %; and the <b>average</b> <b>variation</b> associate...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} {{temporal}} trend of asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis prevalences {{as well as}} their symptoms in adolescents. METHODS Two cross-sectional studies were conducted using the same methodology and questionnaire as was used for adolescents aged 12 to 14 years in the Brazilian city of Florianopolis, SC, Southern Brazil. Based on the international protocol of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) study, adolescents were evaluated in 2001 and 3, 150 in 2012. The schools included in this study were the same as in the 2001 study. These schools were randomly selected after stratification by network (public and private) and geographic location. The total average percentage variation was estimated for the prevalence of asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis and their symptoms. RESULTS The prevalence of reported asthma was 10. 9 % in 2001 and 14. 8 % in 2012, with an <b>average</b> <b>variation</b> of 2. 8 % in the period. The highest <b>average</b> <b>variation</b> in the period was observed among female adolescents (4. 1 %). In parallel a significant increase occurred in reported physician-diagnosed asthma, 7. 3 % in 2001 and 11, 1 % in 2012, with an annual variation of 4. 5 %. The largest increases in reported physician-diagnosed asthma were seen in female (5. 9 %) and male (4. 5 %) public school pupils. In addition, a significant increase in reported rhinoconjunctivitis occurred, with the <b>average</b> <b>variation</b> in the period being 5. 2 %. Reports of severe asthma symptoms remained unchanged during the period, while the annual variation for reported current wheezing (- 1. 3 %) and wheezing during exercise (- 1. 2 %) decreased. CONCLUSIONS The results showed {{a significant increase in the}} annual <b>average</b> <b>variation</b> for asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis prevalence during the 2001 to 2012 period...|$|E

40|$|Tractor and towed {{implement}} system {{models have}} become increasingly important for model-based guidance controller design, virtual prototyping, and operator-and-hardware-in-loop simulation. Various tractor and towed implement models have been proposed in the literature which contain uncertain or time-varying parameters. Sensitivity {{analysis was used to}} identify the effect of system parameter variation on system responses and to identify the most critical system parameters. Sensitivity analysis was performed with respect to three tire cornering stiffness parameters, three tire relaxation length parameters, and two implement inertial parameters. Overall, the system was most sensitive to the tire cornering stiffness parameters and least sensitive to the implement inertial parameters. In general, the variation in the input parameters and the system state variables were related in a non-linear fashion. With the nominal parameter values for a MFWD tractor, a single axle grain cart, and corn stubble surface conditions, a 10 % variation in cornering stiffness parameters caused a 5 % <b>average</b> <b>variation</b> in the system responses whereas an 80 % change in cornering stiffness parameters caused an 80 % <b>average</b> <b>variation</b> at 4. 5 m/s forward velocity. If a 10 % <b>average</b> <b>variation</b> in system responses is acceptable, the cornering stiffness parameters and implement inertial parameters must be estimated within 20 % and 30 % of actual/nominal values respectively. The relaxation length parameters have to be within 75 % of the nominal values...|$|E

Variation of the reactance capacitance parameter of liquids with temperature {{in the range of}} 17 - 60 °C is measured for the plain water and water mixtures. The temperature variations of the capacitance for the cool distilled and tap water samples are studied for the range of 17 - 29 °C obtained. Present results indicate an <b>averaged</b> <b>variation</b> of 4. 69 μF/ °C for the distilled water and 3. 24 μF/ °C for tap water in warm up process to a near room temperature. The cooling behaviors for the warm mineral, tap and salt water liquids are also investigated in this study. <b>Average</b> <b>variations</b> of 0. 54 μF/ °C for the mineral water, 0. 76 μF/ °C for the tap water and 1. 44 μF/ °C for the dilute salt water are obtained for the high temperature range. In comparing the results for different liquids, dilute salt water shows a factor of 2. 6 increase in measured capacitance in comparison with the mineral water when temperature drops from 60. 0 to 35. 0 °C. Hence the reported cell probe provides a relatively accurate method to determine the temperature dependence of reactive capacitance for the pure liquids and also liquids with a trace impurity...|$|R
