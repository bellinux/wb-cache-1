Pipe and Drape is used to divide, hide, and/or decorate a space temporarily. It is the least costly way to surround booth space at an exhibition.When the system is used for exhibition purposes and used instead of the traditional shell scheme option build time and breakdown time is significantly reduced. Pipe and drape {{is a great way}} of adding colour to what would normally be a relatively plain backdrop.|$|R

50|$|Most of Oregon's covered bridges, {{including}} the Belknap Bridge, were built using the Howe truss system, developed in 1840 by the Massachusetts architect William Howe.

50|$|An {{example of}} such a scale {{hypsometer}} is illustrated here, and can be seen to consist of a sighting tube, a fixed horizontal scale, and an <b>adjustable</b> <b>vertical</b> scale with attached plumb line. The principle of operation of such a scale hypsometer is based on the idea of similar triangles in geometry. First the <b>adjustable</b> <b>vertical</b> scale is set at a suitable height. Then as in step 1 in the illustration, a sighting is taken {{on the top of the}} object whose height is to be determined, and the reading on the horizontal scale, h', recorded. Calculation from this value will eventually give the height h, from the eye-line of the observer to the top of the object whose height is to be determined. Similarly as in step 2 of the illustration, a sighting is taken on the base of the object whose height is to be determined, and the reading on the horizontal scale, d', recorded. Calculation from this value will eventually give the distance from the base of the object to the eye-line of the observer. Finally the distance x from the observer to the object needs to be measured.|$|R
50|$|Vertical {{clinging}} and leaping {{is a type}} of arboreal locomotion seen {{most commonly}} among the strepsirrhine primates, and particularly the members of the family Indriidae. It is also used by haplorrhine tarsiers. At rest, the animal clings to a <b>vertical</b> <b>support,</b> such as the side of a tree or bamboo stalk. To move from one plant to another, it pushes off from one <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> with its hindlimbs, landing on another <b>vertical</b> <b>support.</b>|$|R

Using a theoretical model of this bridge, the eigenfrequencies of the structure and the vertical accelerations of the deck are evaluated. Not only different <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> stiffness, but also different trains and train speeds are studied.

40|$|The {{current state}} of SLAM radar is quite advanced, {{featuring}} various methods of data retrieval. One of the methods used is that of video telemetry to locate “common spots” in the surrounding environment which provide positional information during motion. Another method is that of using high-speed high-resolution laser measurement tools which provide a 360 ° {{horizontal field of view}} and a 90 ° vertical field of view. These systems create vast amounts of point cloud data and are expensive, ranging from £ 1, 000 upwards. These systems are often unsuitable for small competition robots due to these reasons.

40|$|The Bailey-BRE Method is a {{simplified}} design approach that facilitates {{the use of}} a tensile membrane action design philosophy for composite floors under fire conditions. The method requires the division of a composite floor into rectangular slab panels, composed of parallel unprotected composite beams in their interior parts, supported vertically by protected composite edge beams. Enhanced slab capacities are obtained after the unprotected beams have lost significant strength, by allowing large deflections of the slab in biaxial bending. The use of tensile membrane action generates significant cost savings in composite structures, as a large number of floor beams can be left unprotected. However, the protected beams which provide <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> to the edges of panels lose strength under the combined effects of thermal degradation and the increased loading due to biaxial bending, and this has the potential to cause panels to lose structural stability altogether. It is therefore imperative to investigate what constitutes adequate <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> and the detrimental effects of inadequate <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> on tensile membrane action of composite slabs in fire. This paper reports on a study of this effect, and puts forward some simple recommendations to avoid loss of stability of composite floors designed by this method...|$|R
40|$|Muscles actuate walking-by {{providing}} <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> {{and forward}} {{progression of the}} mass center. To quantify muscle contributions to <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> and forward progression (i. e., vertical and fore-aft accelerations of the mass center) over a rang e of walking speeds, three-dimensional muscle-actuated simulations of gait were generated and analyzed for eight subjects walking overground at very slow, slow, free, and fast speeds. We found that gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, vasti, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, and soleus were the primary contributors to support and progression at all speeds. With the exception of gluteus medius, contributions from these muscles generally increased with walking speed. During very slow and slow walking speeds, <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> in early stance was primarily provided by a straighter limb, such that skeletal alignment, rather than muscles, provided resistance to gravity. When walking speed increased from slow to free, contributions to support from vasti and soleus increased dramatically. Greater stance-phase knee flexion during free and fast walking speeds caused increased vasti force, which provided support but also slowed progression, while contralateral soleus simultaneously provided increased propulsion. This study provides reference data for muscle contributions to support and progression {{over a wide range}} of walking speeds and highlights the importance of walking speed when evaluating muscle function.
