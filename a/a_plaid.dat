A Budweiser towel, a bloody car seat box, a wad of Harrison's hair, gloves, <b>a</b> <b>plaid</b> shirt and jeans were all found {{in the vicinity of the}} dump site. Examination of the remains indicated that the body was subjected to high temperatures, which was likely a consequence of her body remaining inside of the vehicle for a long period of time during summer weather.

500|$|Peace talks {{began in}} Paris in early 1856, and {{friendly}} relations opened between the Allies and the Russians, with a lively trade across the River Tchernaya. The Treaty of Paris was signed on 30 March 1856, {{after which the}} soldiers left Crimea.
