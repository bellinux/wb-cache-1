These two tribes rose up <b>again</b> a century later, in 921. <b>Again</b> they were quickly subdued, this time by the strategos Krenites Arotras, but managed to remain autonomous and retain their distinct identity until well into Frankish times.|$|E

The algorithm is based on aligning DNA sequences <b>agains</b> a reference sequence and storing only diferencies between sequence and reference model. The work contains basic prerequisities from molecular biology which are needed for understanding of algorithm details. Next aligment algorithms and common compress schemes suitable for storing of diferencies <b>agains</b> reference sequence are described. The work continues with a description of implementation, which is follewed by derivation of time and space complexity and comparison with common compression algorithms. Further continuation of this thesis is discussed in conclusion...|$|R
