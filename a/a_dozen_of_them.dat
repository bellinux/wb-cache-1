5|$|Before the {{evacuation}} of the St Kildian inhabitants, these sheep were farmed. However, when the St Kilda archipelago's human inhabitants were evacuated in 1930, the sheep of Hirta were also removed and in 1932 they were replaced by Soays, which still live there {{as well as on}} Soay itself. Meanwhile, the remaining sheep on Boreray were left to become feral; these became the only survivors of the crofters' sheep, {{and one of the few}} surviving descendants of the Dunface. This means that they are the original, unmodified sheep that used to be farmed on the island. In the 1970s half <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were exported to form the basis of a breeding population on the mainland, but the majority of Borerays still remain on the island.|$|E
25|$|On March 8, 1881, Brocius and {{his friend}} Johnny Ringo rode to Maxey, near Camp Thomas, Arizona. Cowboy Dick Lloyd got drunk while playing poker in O'Neil and Franklin's saloon. After {{shooting}} and wounding one man, Lloyd rode his horse into the saloon where Brocius was drinking. Brocius and several other men resented the interruption, and about <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> including Brocius, shot and killed Lloyd. Owner O'Neil took the blame and was acquitted.|$|E
500|$|The bill, as amended, {{passed the}} Senate without {{recorded}} vote on March 27, 1936. [...] The House of Representatives received the bill on April 1, and referred {{it to the}} Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. It was reported back to the House on April 16, having been amended to require the Cleveland committee to purchase not less than 25,000 coins at one time, eliminating {{the possibility that the}} committee could order an initial 5,000 and then fail to purchase any more. The full House considered the bill on April 23, 1936, with the bill reported by John Joseph Cochran of Missouri as an emergency measure. When he asked for unanimous consent to pass the amended bill, Pennsylvania's Robert F. Rich asked how many coinage bills were going to be considered and if it would not be possible to consolidate <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> into one bill. [...] Cochran replied that he had consulted with Ohio's Robert Crosser and been informed that [...] "if we do not get the authority to print the coins now it will be useless". The following day, Bulkley moved that the Senate concur in the House amendments, which it did, and the bill was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on May 5, 1936.|$|E

2500|$|The {{municipality}} has 40 beaches including 28 on {{the mainland}} and 12 in Caja de Muertos. Among these, about <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are most notable, including El Tuque Beach in the El Tuque sector on highway PR-2, west of the city, La Guancha Beach at the La Guancha sector south of the city, and four beaches in Caja de Muertos: Pelicano, Playa Larga, Carrucho, and Coast Guard beach. [...] A ferry must be boarded at La Guancha for transportation to the Caja de Muertos beaches.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, DNA tests {{conducted}} upon remains {{identified in}} 1980 through dental analysis {{as those of}} Michael Marino revealed that the remains had been misidentified. Marino's mother had always doubted the identification of her son because clothing found upon the body was inconsistent with what her son had worn when she last saw him. In addition, the dental X-ray conducted upon the victim identified as Michael Marino had revealed the victim had all of his second molars, whereas a dental X-ray conducted upon Marino in March 1976 revealed one molar had not erupted. Nonetheless, the orthodontist who had identified Marino's remains has stated his conviction in the accuracy of his findings, adding he had [...] "compared 32 teeth, probably half <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had very distinct fillings {{and every one of}} them was consistent with Michael Marino." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'A bail!' 'Yes, my dear sir--half <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> here. Bail you to any amount, {{and only}} charge half a crown. Curious trade, isn't it?' said Perker, regaling {{himself with a}} pinch of snuff.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been drillin' a {{force that}} can do good work in what's before us, if they're given a show, an' I'll answer for half <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>'em,</b> guaranteein' they'll show {{themselves}} to be men." ...|$|R
60|$|We got to {{the wharf}} just afore six. The John Henry 'ad gorn, but the skipper 'ad done all the 'arm he could afore he sailed, and, if I 'adn't kept my temper, I should ha' murdered arf <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>'em.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "There'll be {{some tough}} chewing in the mouthful, I reckon," [...] persisted Norman valiantly. [...] "Germany'll break her teeth on it. Don't {{you tell me}} one Britisher isn't a match for ten foreigners. I could polish off <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> myself with both hands tied behind my back!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] was the answer. [...] "I seen a dance-house girl down in Arizona once, {{with some}} big sparklers on her. They wasn't real. She said if they was she wouldn't be dancin'. Said they'd be worth all of fifty thousan', an' she didn't have <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> all told." ...|$|R

60|$|We {{were confronted}} by half <b>a</b> <b>dozen,</b> some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> big, some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> little.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know a {{boy with}} <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>'em,</b> and he said he'd give me one, only I hadn't any place to keep it, so I couldn't have it.

6000|$|Bradley tiptoed to {{the door}} and peered {{cautiously}} into the well; then he stepped back beside the girl. [...] "There are half <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> coming up; but possibly they will pass this room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are half}} <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> on the roof," [...] Boduoc said, [...] "and a score or more round the hut. At present they haven't winded us, {{for the air}} is in our faces." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{laughter}} {{died down}} as Kenneth's insult penetrated their befuddled minds. An instant's lull there was, like the lull in nature that precedes a clap of thunder. Then, as with one accord, <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> bore down upon him.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right! but don't fire {{unless they}} get close. The shot will not carry far like a bullet; but if fired {{when they are}} close it is better than any bullet, for you might hit half <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid General Braddock's defeat {{will cause}} us lots {{of trouble in}} the future.
