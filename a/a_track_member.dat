One of the first songs that Tweedy wrote was [...] "Misunderstood", a song about a tortured musical artist {{from the point of}} view of a fan. The song contains several overt references to the breakup of Uncle Tupelo, including the addition of insults that Farrar used against Tweedy—specifically one calling him a [...] "mama's boy". Part of the song's lyrics ("Take the guitar player for a ride/See, he ain't never been satisfied/He thinks he owes some kind of debt/Be years before he gets over it") are originally from Peter Laughner, an underground alternative rock artist from Cleveland that died at 24 in 1977, taken from his song [...] "Amphetamine". The song concludes with the artist lashing out against the listener with satirical self-pity, a rebellion against the way that fans saw Uncle Tupelo as only an archetype of Gram Parsons inspired country rock. To induce a feeling of chaos on the <b>track,</b> the <b>members</b> of Wilco recorded <b>a</b> <b>track</b> where the <b>members</b> switched to novel instruments and placed sections of it into the song.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} phenomenological {{study was}} designed to gain an in-depth understanding of the lived experiences of non-tenure <b>track,</b> extension-based faculty <b>members</b> who have academic positions in research-intensive Land-Grant institutions, to determine how their positions affect their productive behaviors and actions. A review of the literature found gaps in the understanding of productivity, between tenure-track and non-tenure <b>track</b> faculty <b>members,</b> as well as traditional departmentally-based and extension-based members. ^ Using a purposeful sampling method, I targeted nine faculty members working in agriculture-based extension positions, representing 41 % of the eligible population set. The use of a phenomenological method provided an understanding of their lived experiences as they conducted their productive work lives. ^ The central research question for this study was what role does productivity play in success for <b>a</b> non-tenure <b>track</b> faculty <b>member</b> working in extension agricultural fields within a large research-intensive, public Land-Grant institution? ^ Participant interviews showed that non-tenure <b>track</b> faculty <b>members</b> spent the majority of their work time in outreach activities, and lesser time in activities related to research and teaching. Faculty members found that outreach and teaching activities provided greater levels of satisfaction and personal reward, especially with evidence of measurable or observed adoption of instructed principles. The study demonstrated a wide variety of research, teaching, and outreach behaviors that were largely self-directed with support from advising bodies, such as governing boards, committees, groups, and councils. The study revealed gaps in productivity relative to what faculty members considered was important, and what administrators collected as evidence of productive behavior. ^ These findings have broad implications for non-tenure <b>track</b> faculty <b>members,</b> clientele, and administrators. Implications discussed demonstrate a need shift in understanding of the extension educator and work function. Extension educators must expect that impacting the lives of the clientele come at a price, to include the challenges of self-determination, academic ambiguity, and the opportunity of working within exclusive client communities; however, paying the price leads to personal and career growth. ...|$|R

The success of any organization is clearly dependent on its ability to select and acquire talent. Likewise, in academia, the selection of tenure track faculty is also a critical element for any college or university in carrying out its vision and strategic goals in the higher education arena.

Not only did the majority of tenured/tenure track faculty librarians not have the standard doctorate degree possessed by most other tenured/tenure track faculty, but there were also questions surrounding the librarians’ purported lack of teaching and their ability to perform original research as required for those tenure and promotion standards set by the academic institution.
