5|$|New Jersey's {{first state}} {{constitution}} was adopted on July 2, 1776. The American Revolutionary War was underway and George Washington {{had recently been}} defeated in New York, putting New Jersey in imminent danger of invasion. With Patriot and Tory factions plotting and battling each other, New Jersey was a state at war and was nearly a state at civil war. Composed in a span of five days and ratified only two days later, during this state of emergency, on July 2, 1776, the New Jersey State Constitution reflects the turbulence and uncertainty of the moment. Its primary objective {{was to provide a}} basic governmental framework that would preempt New Jersey's fall into anarchy. <b>And</b> <b>yet</b> <b>this</b> Constitution served as the charter document for the State's government for the next 68 years.|$|E
5|$|This {{suggestion}} {{stemmed from}} the observation that many engineers relied on {{the basic principles of}} physics and mechanics to guide their work, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>this</b> often required inventors and engineers to become scientists as well to obtain experimental data—something that they were rarely qualified or resourced to do. Short of government funding of such research, Evans also attempted to create {{in the aftermath of the}} Steam Engineer's Guide what he called 'The Experiment Company', which would be a private research consortium to conduct reliable experiments and gather data for the benefits of subscribed members. The venture failed and Evans could find no paying stockholders to launch it, possibly due to Evans committing the new venture to developing a steam wagon of his own design. The Franklin Institute would be founded in Philadelphia a few years after Evans's death on similar principles.|$|E
25|$|On further reflection, the Meditator {{realizes that}} even simple {{things can be}} doubted. Omnipotent God could make even our {{conception}} of mathematics false. One might argue that God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by this reasoning we should think that God would not deceive him with regard to anything, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>this</b> is clearly not true. If we suppose there is no God, then there is even greater likelihood of being deceived, since our imperfect senses {{would not have been}} created by a perfect being.|$|E

500|$|The novel {{ends at the}} end of Francia's life, {{with him}} condemning Patiño to death for {{supposedly}} plotting against him, followed by Francia's death in a fire in 1840. [...] As the characters and plot disintegrate, so apparently does the novel. [...] The final line is another interpolation: [...] "(the remainder stuck together, illegible, the rest unable to be found, the worm-eaten letters of the Book hopelessly scattered)." [...] <b>And</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>this</b> is not quite the last word, as it is followed by a [...] "Final Compiler's Note" [...] that reflects on the compilation and the book as a whole. [...] Here the novel seems to pass responsibility on to [...] "the no less fictitious and autonomous reader." ...|$|E
500|$|Loose {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics; it holds an average score of 71 out of 100 at aggregate website Metacritic. AllMusic and musicOMH cited the [...] "revitalising" [...] effect of Timbaland on Furtado's music, and The Guardian called it [...] "slick, smart and surprising." [...] Q found {{most of it}} to be [...] "an inventive, hip-hop-inflected delight." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that [...] "the music and the lyrics are mainly aimed at dance floors, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>this</b> album keeps reminding listeners that a dance floor {{is one of the}} most complicated places on earth." [...] In its review, AllMusic wrote [...] "It's on this final stretch of the album that the Furtado and Timbaland pairing seems like a genuine collaboration, staying true to the Nelly of her first two albums, but given an adventurous production that helps open her songs up ... Timbaland has revitalized Nelly Furtado both creatively and commercially with Loose". She won her first BRIT Award—Best International Female—in 2007.|$|E

2500|$|The {{researchers}} found that {{the time of the}} conscious intention to move T normally occurred too late to be the cause of movement genesis. See the example of a subject's graph below on the right. Although it is not shown on the graph, the subject's readiness potentials (ERP) tells us that his actions start at –2.8 seconds, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>this</b> is substantially earlier than his conscious intention to move, time [...] "T" [...] (−1.8 seconds). Matsuhashi and Hallet concluded that the feeling of the conscious intention to move does not cause movement genesis; both the feeling of intention and the movement itself are the result of unconscious processing.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{planned to}} live {{together}} after Edleston grew older, but the two parted and Byron would never see the boy again as Edleston died from consumption in 1811. As well as spending time with friends, Byron did join in {{with the rest of}} the community; however, he did not enjoy this time because, as he said, [...] "I could not share in the commonplace libertinism of the place and time without disgust. <b>And</b> <b>yet</b> <b>this</b> very disgust, and my heart thrown back upon itself, threw me into excesses perhaps more fatal than those from which I shrunk, as fixing upon one (at a time) the passions which, spread amongst many, would have hurt only myself".|$|E
2500|$|The pederastic {{relationships}} {{common to}} ancient Greek life {{are also at}} the fore of this dialogue. [...] In addition to theme of love discussed in the speeches, seeming double entendres and sexual innuendo is abundant; we see the flirtation between Phaedrus and Socrates as Phaedrus encourages Socrates to make his first speech, Phaedrus makes a remark at noon-time that Socrates should not leave as the heat has not passed and it is [...] "straight-up, as they say," [...] Socrates wishes to know what Phaedrus is holding under his cloak, and so on. [...] The relationships discussed in the speeches are explicitly pederastic. [...] <b>And</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>this</b> is tempered in various ways; role reversals between lover and beloved are constant, {{as they are in}} the Symposium. [...] Socrates, ostensibly the lover, exhorts Phaedrus to lead the way at various times, and the dialogue ends with Socrates and Phaedrus leaving as [...] "friends"–equals, rather than partaking in the lover/beloved relationship inherent in Greek pederasty. [...] In the beginning, they sit themselves under a chaste tree, which is precisely what its name suggests—often known as [...] "monk's pepper", it was used by monks to decrease sexual urges and is believed to be an antaphrodisiac. [...] Notably, Socrates sees the pederastic relationship as ideally devoid of sexual consummation; rather than being used for sexual pleasure, the relationship is a form of divine madness, helping both lover and beloved to grow and reach the divine.|$|E

2500|$|Death is {{inevitable}} and temporally unpredictable. Kierkegaard believed that individuals needed to sincerely and intensely come to realize the truth of that fact {{in order to live}} passionately. Kierkegaard accuses society of being in death-denial. Even though people see death all around them and grasp as an objective fact that everyone dies, few people truly understand, subjectively and inwardly, that they will die someday. For example, in Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Kierkegaard notes that people never think to say, [...] "I shall certainly attend your party, but I must make an exception for the contingency that a roof tile happens to blow down and kill me; for in that case, I cannot attend." [...] This is jest as far as Kierkegaard is concerned. But there is also earnestness involved in the thought of death. Kierkegaard said the following about death in his Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1844. [...] We shall not decide which life fights the good fight most easily, but we all agree that every human being ought to fight the good fight, from which no one is shut out, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>this</b> is so glorious that if it were granted only once to a past generation under exceptional circumstances-yes, what a description envy and discouragement would then know how to give! The difference is about the same as that in connection with the thought of death. As soon as a human being is born, he begins to die. But the difference is that there are some people for whom the thought of death comes into existence with birth and is present to them in the quiet peacefulness of childhood and the buoyancy of youth; whereas others have a period in which this thought is not present to them until, when the years run out, the years of vigor and vitality, the thought of death meets them on their way. Who, now, is going to decide which life was easier, whether it was the [...] life of those who continually lived with a certain reserve because the thought of death was present to them or the life of those who so abandoned themselves to life that they almost forgot the existence of death? ...|$|E
