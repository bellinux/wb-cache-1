40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the effectiveness of}} a less expensive adsorbent, a discarded rubber tyre (DRT) in removing toluene from aqueous phase. <b>Adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> on a DRT has been studied by using batch system at 25 and 30 °C. It was found that up to 70 % of toluene was removed for the range of toluene initial concentrations studied between 50 - 300 mg/l. Using linearized forms of equilibrium models, namely Langmuir and Freundlich models, the maximum adsorptive capacities were determined. It was evident from the experimental data that, although both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models could describe the isotherm data, the <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> on a DRT was described well by the Freundlich isotherm. For Freundlich K values, sorption capacities were 6. 6374 and 7. 7535 mg/l at 25 and 30 °C, respectively. The values of Freundlich exponent n were greater than one for both temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> from aqueous {{solutions}} onto hydrophobic zeolites was {{studied by}} combining chromatographic, thermal and structural techniques. Three beta zeolites (notated BEAs, since {{they belong to}} BEA framework type), with different SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratios (i. e., 25, 38 and 360), before and after calcination, were tested as adsorbents of toluene from aqueous media. This was performed by measuring the adsorbed quantities of toluene onto zeolites in a wide concentration range of solute. The adsorption data were fitted with isotherms whose models are based on surface heterogeneity of the adsorbent, according to the defective structure of beta zeolites. The thermal treatment considerably increases the <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene,</b> in the low concentration range, on all BEAs, probably due to surface and structural modifications induced by calcination. Among the calcined BEAs, the most hydrophobic zeolite (i. e., that with SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio of 360) showed the highest binding constant, probably due to its high affinity for an organophilic solute such as toluene. The high sorption capacity was confirmed by thermogravimetric analyses on BEAs, before and after saturation with toluene...|$|E
40|$|Gasification of biomass, {{followed}} by ZrO 2 -catalyzed hot gas clean-up at 600 – 900 °C for the oxidation of impurities (such as tar), is an environmentally attractive way to produce heat and power or synthesis gas. The interaction of toluene (as a model compound for tar) with ZrO 2 -based gasification gas clean-up catalysts was studied by in situ DRIFTS and temperature-programmed gas-phase analysis. Toluene {{was found to}} interact in four ways with ZrO 2 surfaces: forming molecularly adsorbed toluene, surface benzoate species, carbonaceous deposits and surface benzyl species. The <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> {{in the absence of}} gas-phase oxygen at ambient temperature on ZrO 2 -based catalysts resulted in weakly adsorbed molecular toluene, while the <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> at higher temperatures yielded carbonaceous deposits and surface benzoate species. Combined analysis of infrared and TP data showed that some of the benzoate species decomposed, producing benzene and carbon dioxide. Surface benzyl species, on the other hand, were detected on the surface of ZrO 2 -based catalysts only in the presence of gas-phase oxygen at a temperature where toluene and oxygen started to convert. Therefore, it is suggested that benzyl species are the active intermediates from toluene to carbon oxides during the gasification gas cleaning over ZrO 2 -based catalysts...|$|E

The <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> benzene, <b>toluene,</b> and o-xylene as vapors by the dry TMA-clays and as solutes from water by the wet TMA-clays was studied. The <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> the organic vapors by the dry TMA-smectite samples was strong and apparently consisted of interactions with both the aluminosilicate mineral surfaces and the TMA exchange ions in the interlayers. In the <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> organic vapors, the closer packing of TMA ions in the dry high-charge TMA-smectite, compared with the dry low-charge TMA-smectite, resulted in a somewhat higher degree <b>of</b> shape-selective <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> benzene, <b>toluene,</b> and xylene. In the presence <b>of</b> water, the <b>adsorption</b> capacities <b>of</b> both samples for the aromatic ompounds were significantly reduced, although the uptake of benzene from water by the low-charge TMA-smectite was still substantial. This lower sorption capacity was accompanied by increased shape-selectivity for the aromatic ompounds. The reduction in uptake and increased se-lectivity was much more pronounced for the water-saturated, high-charge TMA-smectite than for the low-charge TMA-smectite. Hydration of the TMA exchange ions and/or the mineral surfaces apparently reduced the accessibility of the aromatic molecules to interlamellar regions. The resulting water-induced sieving effect was greater for the high-charge TMA-smectite due to the higher density of exchanged TMA-ions. The low-charge Wyoming TMA-smectite was a highly effective adsorbent for removing benzene from water and may be useful for purifying benzene-contaminated water...|$|R

40|$|In this work, the <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> on pure-silica MEL zeolite is {{investigated}} using {{a variety}} of experimental and simulation methods. First, we measured the volumetric and calorimetric isotherms at 301 K and at 315 K. The volumetric adsorption isotherm presents a substep at a loading of roughly 4 molecules per unit cell that shifts to higher pressures at higher temperatures and that coincides with a sudden increase in the isosteric heat of adsorption. Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the substep at half load is caused by the <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> molecules at different energetic sites within the porous network. According to this, toluene molecules occupy first the intersections, and once all intersections are filled, additional toluene molecules place themselves within the channels. The structure of the adsorbate/adsorbent system was further investigated by performing X-ray powder diffraction experiments of the zeolite at three different loads: empty, at half load (before the substep), and at high load (after the substep). Numerous new low intensity peaks and splittings of existing peaks at the empty and half-loaded diffractograms appear in the diffraction pattern of the high load sample. Atomic structural models compatible with the experimental spectra were obtained by performing N-reverse Monte Carlo simulations. Whereas at half load a good fit of the experimental diffraction pattern can be obtained using the rigid zeolite approximation, at high load, this is only possible when the flexibility of the zeolite is incorporated. In this structural model, the channel cross sections are deformed from a nearly circular shape in the empty zeolite to a more elliptical shape {{in the case of the}} high load zeolite.

Two plasma-catalytic configurations are explored, namely: post-plasma catalysis (PPC) and in-plasma catalysis (IPC). Since heterogeneous processes are pointed out as key steps of the plasma-catalyst coupling, the catalyst surface has been monitored by two complementary in situ diagnostics: (i) diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and (ii) transmission {{fourier transform infrared spectroscopy}} using Sorbent track (ST) device. Dielectric barrier discharges (DBD) are used in both PPC and IPC configurations to induce adsorbed toluene oxidation. Toluene in dry air is first adsorbed on the selected catalytic surface: ceria (CeO 2). Subsequently, the plasma is switched on. During the experiment, the ceria surface is monitored by infrared to study toluene adsorption and oxidation mechanisms. The <b>adsorption</b> capacity <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> on ceria is, respectively, measured in the configurations of PPC and IPC by DRIFTS and ST.

It is shown that microporous material NaY has the largest <b>adsorption</b> capacity <b>of</b> 0. 2873 mL/g, and the amorphous SiO 2 exhibits the least capacity of 0. 1003 mL/g. MCM- 41 also shows a lower break through capacity {{in spite of the}} relatively small pore diameter, because it can not provide the necessary small geometric confinement for the tiny adsorbates.

Among the solvents fulfilling the required characteristics (non toxicity and no biodegradability, high affinity for VOCs, solvent regeneration, good mass transfer, [...] .), octyl isoquinolium bis(trifluoromethyl) sulfonimide ionic liquid (IL), [octiq+][Tf 2 N–], appears especially promising. The first step of the process consists in the absorption of the VOC contained {{in the air to}} be treated by the IL as the VOC vapor contacts the IL. In this work, we report molecular dynamics simulations of {IL + toluene}/vapor and IL/toluene vapor interfaces to elucidate the physical phenomena ruling the interfacial <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> and its absorption by the IL. We first predicted a high affinity between [octiq+][Tf 2 N–] and toluene, in agreement with experimental data. Moreover, we evidenced an enhancement of the interfacial toluene density, which allowed us improving the understanding of the interfacial capture and degradation of toluene...|$|E
40|$|Multiwalled carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) were oxidized by {{sodium hypochlorite}} (NaOCl) Solution and were employed as adsorbents to study their characterizations and <b>adsorption</b> performance <b>of</b> benzene, <b>toluene,</b> ethylbenzene and p-xylene (abbreviated as BTEX) {{in an aqueous}} Solution. The physicochemical properties of CNTs such as purity, structure and surface nature were greatly improved after oxidation, which significantly enhanced BTEX adsorption capacity. The <b>adsorption</b> capacity <b>of</b> CNT(NaOCl) increased with contact time and initial adsorbate concentration, but changed insignificantly with solution ionic strength and pH. A comparative Study on the BTEX adsorption revealed that the CNT(NaOCl) had better BTEX adsorption as compared to CNTs and granular activated carbon. This Suggests that the CNT(NaOCl) are efficient BTEX adsorbents and that they possess good potential for BTEX removal in wastewater treatment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The <b>adsorption</b> {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> benzene, <b>toluene,</b> ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) from aqueous solutions by montmorillonite (Mt) modified with poly {{ethylene glycol}} (PEG-Mt) were investigated. The batch adsorption technique {{was used to}} assess the influence of various parameters such as loading rates of the surfactant, contact time, pH, adsorbate concentration, solution ion strength and temperature on the BTEX sorption capacity by PEG-Mt. The raw and modified Mt was specified with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The XRD results showed that the interlayer spacing of the raw montmorillonite (12. 10 Å) was increased by PEG surfactant modification (17. 48 Å). The <b>adsorption</b> capacity <b>of</b> the PEG-Mt was increased by increasing the surfactant loading until 200 % cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the clay. The equilibrium was achieved at the contact time of 24 h. The <b>adsorption</b> capacity <b>of</b> the adsorbent was in order of...|$|R
40|$|To {{increase}} {{public awareness}} of theoretical materials physics, {{a small group of}} high school students is invited to participate actively in a current research projects at Chalmers University of Technology. The Chalmers research group explores methods for filtrating hazardous and otherwise unwanted molecules from drinking water, for example by adsorption in active carbon filters. In this project, the students use graphene as an idealized model for active carbon, and estimate the energy <b>of</b> <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> the methylbenzene <b>toluene</b> on graphene {{with the help of the}} atomic-scale calculational method density functional theory. In this process the students develop an insight into applied quantum physics, a topic usually not taught at this educational level, and gain some experience with a couple of state-of-the-art calculational tools in materials research...|$|R
