500|$|Early reviews were mixed. Some critics {{found the}} novel too preachy; others, {{including}} Leonard Woolf, {{thought it was}} poorly structured, or complained of sloppiness in style. There was praise for its sincerity and artistry, and some expressed sympathy with Hall's moral argument. In the {{three weeks after the}} book appeared in bookstores, no reviewer called for its suppression or suggested that it should not have been published. A review in T.P.'s & Cassell's Weekly foresaw no difficulties for The Well: [...] "One cannot say what effect this book will have on the public attitude of silence or derision, but every reader will <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mr.</b> Havelock Ellis in the preface, that 'the poignant situations are set forth with a complete absence of offence.'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Tom's Rhinoplasty" [...] was released, {{along with}} 11 other episodes, in a three-disc DVD set in November 1998. It was {{included}} in the third volume, which also included the episodes [...] "Starvin' Marvin", [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] and [...] "Mecha-Streisand". The DVD commentary recorded by Parker and Stone for [...] "Tom's Rhinoplasty" [...] has been cited as one of the primary reasons the commentaries {{were not included in the}} South Park Season One DVD release. Warner Bros., which released the DVD set, refused to include the commentaries due to [...] "standards" [...] issues with some of the statements unless Parker and Stone allowed the tracks to be edited, which they refused. Media outlets said the commentary that most bothered Warner Bros. executives was the one for [...] "Tom's Rhinoplasty", in which Parker and Stone say they <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mr.</b> Garrison's character that the 1997 film Contact (also released by Warner Bros.) was [...] "terrible". The commentaries were ultimately released on CD separately from the DVDs.|$|E
2500|$|Scott {{voted for}} the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. In 1966, along with two other Republican Senators and five Republican Representatives, Scott signed a {{telegram}} sent to Georgia Governor Carl E. Sanders regarding the Georgia legislature's refusal to seat the recently elected Julian Bond in their state House of Representatives. This refusal, said the telegram, was [...] "a dangerous attack on representative government. None of us <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bond's views on the Vietnam War; in fact we strongly repudiate these views. But unless otherwise determined by a court of law, which the Georgia Legislature is not, he is entitled to express them." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 18, 2005, McKinney {{was one of}} {{only three}} House members to vote for H.R. 571, {{introduced}} by House Armed Services Committee chairman Duncan Hunter, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, on which McKinney sat. Hunter, a Republican, offered this resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces in Iraq in place of John Murtha's H.J.Res. 73, which called for redeployment [...] "at the earliest possible date." [...] In her prepared statement, McKinney accused the Republicans of [...] "trying to set a trap for the Democrats. A 'no' vote for this Resolution will obscure {{the fact that there is}} strong support for withdrawal of US forces from Iraq ... In voting for this bill, let me be perfectly clear that I am not saying the United States should exit Iraq without a plan. I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mr.</b> Murtha that security and stability in Iraq should be pursued through diplomacy. I simply want to vote 'yes' to an orderly withdrawal from Iraq." ...|$|E

60|$|I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> {{everything}} <b>Mr.</b> Choate {{has said}} in his letter regarding <b>Mr.</b> Jerome; I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> everything <b>Mr.</b> Shepard has said; and I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> everything <b>Mr.</b> Jerome {{has said in}} his own commendation. And I thought Mr. Jerome was modest in that. If he {{had been talking about}} another officer of this county, he could have painted the joys and sorrows of office and his victories in even stronger language than he did.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will {{do nothing}} of the kind. I do not at all {{think that it is}} a fitting habit for young ladies. I do not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Westmacott upon the point." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mr.</b> Dunning altogether," [...] {{answered}} Martha, quickly. [...] "I wish {{with all}} my heart, Hugh, you would order that hideous-looking thing {{to be taken away}} this very week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} {{permission}} to think, Sir Peregrine," [...] said Mr. Furnival, [...] "that {{you would not}} <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mr.</b> Graham if you had given to the matter much deep consideration." ...|$|E

5000|$|To {{the last}} three questions, Hawkins {{essentially}} <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mrs</b> Carlill's counsel, and said [...] "no", adding arguments of his own. To {{the question of whether}} there was a contract, he said [...] "yes," [...] and gave his reasons.|$|R
60|$|All in {{the party}} <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mr.</b> Radbury in this, {{although}} some {{said that it was}} better Whippler should be killed than some man with a wife and children. Whippler and his late wife had never had any offspring.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I don't at all <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mr.</b> Peck in many things, {{but he is}} a good man, {{and last}} night he spoke the truth. I shouldn't be {{speaking}} it if I didn't tell you I thought so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm for {{securing}} my own money. It's very hard,--after all the risk. I quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hart {{in what he}} {{says about}} the squire. Such a piece of premeditated dishonesty for robbing gentlemen of their property I never before heard. It's awful." ...|$|E

60|$|If it be {{essentially}} {{and absolutely}} necessary {{to choose between}} the two, we are inclined to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Grantly that the bell, book, and candle are the lesser evil of the two.

50|$|Gary Koh of Genesis Loudspeakers {{was among}} the few that also {{received}} {{a copy of the}} K2 HD Sampler from Winston Ma, and he <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mr.</b> Ma's impression on the K2HD.

6000|$|... "Mr. Ray {{said she}} was {{certainly}} very refined, and her Salome was always a lady. And that is the essential thing," [...] Louise added, decisively.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mrs. Munger, {{willing to}} put the case impartially; [...] "and I should be {{perfectly}} willing to drop the invited dance and supper, if it was thought best, though I must say I don't at all <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mr.</b> Peck in principle.

6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid that}} admonition hasn't had much effect, and I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mr.</b> Grant that the Sachem is a {{gathering}} place for doubtful characters," [...] Hardie went on.

6000|$|By {{this time}} Mary was almost persuaded that she, too, was {{included}} in the [...] "we," [...] and <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mr.</b> Basnett in believing that [...] "our" [...] views, [...] "our" [...] society, [...] "our" [...] policy, stood for something quite definitely segregated from the main body of society in a circle of superior illumination.|$|R

6000|$|I confess that, {{although}} I <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Makely {{in regard}} to what the workmen had better do, her position had been arrived at by such extraordinary reasoning that I blushed for her; at the same time, I wanted to laugh.

60|$|Mr. Luker {{believed}} {{the story to}} be, as to all main essentials, true--on this ground, that Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite was too great a fool to have invented it.

6000|$|I can <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mr.</b> Greenwood, when he {{says that}} [...] "Genius is a potentiality, and whether it will ever become an actuality, and what it will produce, depends upon the moral qualities with which it is associated, and the {{opportunities}} that are open to it--in a word, on the circumstances of its environment."

6000|$|... "I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mr.</b> Wilder, Dr. Huxtable, {{that you}} would have done wisely to consult me.

6000|$|... "Mark and Geoffrey {{look as if}} they <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>Mr.</b> Warwick in his--excuse me if I say, {{dangerous}} ideas; but I fancy {{the personal}} application of them would change their minds.
