50|$|The reorder tone, {{also known}} as the fast busy tone, or the {{congestion}} tone, or <b>all</b> <b>trunks</b> <b>busy</b> (ATB) tone is an audible call progress tone in the public switched telephone network (PSTN) that isreturned to a calling party to indicate that the call cannot be processed through the network.|$|R
50|$|If <b>all</b> <b>trunks</b> were <b>busy,</b> {{the marker}} did a route advance {{to operate a}} {{different}} route relay to select an alternate route via a tandem. This feature kept trunk groups small, and more heavily loaded with traffic, thus saving cost in outside plant.|$|R
5000|$|In the now-obsolete Autovon {{phone system}} these keys, {{used to set}} {{priority}} of a military call, were the red buttons in the photo on the right. Autovon included four precedence levels: Routine (no special tone), Priority (D), Immediate (C) and Flash (B) with Flash Override (A) as a capability. Each {{had the ability to}} interrupt lower-priority calls in progress if <b>all</b> <b>trunks</b> were <b>busy.</b> Each was activated using a button in an additional column of the keypad: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{signal is}} used to {{indicate}} that the call is unreachable, either because <b>all</b> circuits (<b>trunks)</b> are <b>busy,</b> the called number is out of service, the call is unroutable, or sometimes that an invalid code has been dialed. A PBX also often indicates an invalid extension, while dialing an invalid telephone number on the PSTN usually results in playing the triple special information tone and a recorded announcement. Many telephone companies in North America and in the United Kingdom often play the reorder tone after the reading of a recorded announcement explaining the reason of call failure, typically when the other party fails to receive the call after ringing for several minutes. The reorder tone is sometimes confused with the <b>busy</b> <b>signal</b> because they use the same frequencies and differ only in that the <b>busy</b> <b>signal's</b> beeping sounds have a slower cadence than those of the reorder tone.|$|R
2500|$|Idle {{outgoing}} trunks {{were picked}} {{by the traditional}} [...] "sleeve test" [...] method, as lines were, except that hunting was the usual practice for trunks rather than a special service feature. The selector moved upward to the proper trunk group, and then through twenty terminals, checking for one with an un-grounded sleeve lead, then selecting and grounding it. If <b>all</b> the <b>trunks</b> were <b>busy,</b> the selector sent back an All Circuits Busy tone (reorder tone). [...] There was no provision for alternate routing as in earlier manual systems and later more sophisticated mechanical ones.|$|R
50|$|Some trunked systems queue calls if a user's {{attempt to}} {{transmit}} gets a <b>busy</b> <b>signal.</b> In other words, if someone presses their push-to-talk button and <b>all</b> <b>trunked</b> radio system channels are busy, some systems will wait-list {{users in the}} same order as their <b>busy</b> <b>signals</b> occur. When a channel becomes available, the system notifies the user. There is disagreement about MultiNet's ability to queue calls when all channels are busy. Usually, the control channel is the path allowing wait-listed users to get in line. One publication says MultiNet communicates using low baud rate data multiplexed under voice if all channels are busy. One report says MultiNet users on a live system who got a busy had to either hold their push-to-talk button down continually until the system assigned them a channel or periodically check for an available channel by repeatedly pressing the push-to-talk.|$|R
50|$|A reorder tone, {{sometimes}} called a fast <b>busy</b> <b>signal,</b> indicates that no transmission {{path to the}} called number is available. This can occur either because the Inter-LATA <b>trunk</b> is <b>busy</b> {{at the time of}} the call- in which case this clears in a few seconds, if one redials- or the number is temporarily out of service, due to maintenance or the number is not willing to accept calls. It is otherwise played after a recorded announcement explaining the reason for a general call failure.|$|R
5000|$|... a fast <b>busy</b> <b>signal</b> (also called reorder tone or {{overflow}} busy tone) signifying {{that there}} is congestion in the telephone network, or possibly that the calling subscriber has delayed too long in dialling all the necessary digits. The fast <b>busy</b> <b>signal</b> is generally {{twice as fast as}} the normal <b>busy</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
60|$|Later on I saw {{it again}} on half-a-dozen occasions, but never {{succeeded in getting}} what I call a {{satisfying}} sight of it, perched woodpecker-wise on a mossy <b>trunk,</b> <b>busy</b> at its old fascinating occupation of deftly picking off the running ants.|$|R
5000|$|Ready and <b>busy</b> <b>signal</b> tones were {{adjusted}} by {{the radio}} set's volume control. This resulted {{in situations where}} users got a <b>busy</b> <b>signal</b> but could not hear it because the vehicle's siren was on or the patrol car windows were rolled down.|$|R
5000|$|In {{some parts}} of the United States when a line is busy an {{intercept}} message plays over a <b>busy</b> <b>signal,</b> then when the message finishes only the <b>busy</b> <b>signal</b> continues. This was done ever since automatic ring back was introduced. Or the message would play once and then the <b>busy</b> <b>signal</b> is played after the message. For example, the message would say: The number you have called is busy. If it becomes free in the next 30 minutes you will hear a special ring when a call can be attempted. Please hang up.|$|R
