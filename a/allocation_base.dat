5000|$|These {{discussion}} focussed {{on topics}} such as [...] "costing methods, estimating, overhead allocations, economies of scale and other topics normally associated with the accounting." [...] Wells (1996) stated, that these early pioneers in the field of cost accounting, became aware of the [...] "arbitrary nature of cost allocations... proceeding accountants by 50 years or more." [...] In that respect, Arnold considered these costs 'probable', yet considered the information from the system 'absolute correct.' Randolph and Diemer (1903) would speak of 'accurate costs' and 'correct' or 'accurate' information. Wells added that these [...] "engineers (as did the accountants who followed them) failed to recognize the difference between a system that allocated all of the overhead costs [...] "accurately"—there were no residual costs unallocated—and the arbitrary cost of production that resulted from the use of some broad <b>allocation</b> <b>base</b> such as direct wages." ...|$|E

40|$|Predetermined {{overhead}} rate {{is based}} on estimates rather than actual result. This is because the predetermined overhead rate is computed before the period begins and is used to apply overhead cost throughout the period. Companies typically base their predetermined overhead rates on the estimated, or budgeted, amount of <b>allocation</b> <b>base</b> (cost drivers) for the upcoming period. The purpose {{of this research is}} to compare PT Kusumahadi Santosa’s predetermined overhead rate based on the traditional costing with those rate computes or bases on the activity-based costing (ABC). PT Kusumahadi Santosa’s manufacturing overhead cost data (primary data) is used to reach the purpose. PT Kusumahadi Santosa is the manufacturer that process threads into cloth materials. The result of this research as follows. PT Kusumahadi Santosa’s applied overhead cost base on predetermined overhead rates computes on the traditional costing (uses machine hours <b>allocation</b> <b>base)</b> is Rp 51. 324, 044, 510, 00, while those applied overhead cost based on predetermined overhead rates computes on ABC is Rp 53. 926. 959. 944, 00. We conclude if PT Kusumahadi Santosa uses cost plus pricing to set the price of his products, those products is underpricing. This because the overhead cost is under applied. We suggest that PT Kusumahadi Santosa use ABC to compute and to apply the manufacturing overhead cost in order to calculate his product inventory cost and set his product price properly. ...|$|E

The report examines the impact of the implementation of reading programs selected by Reading First schools on all students including different ethnic groups, English language learners, and special education students. In this report student performance is shown and compared to previous results of students in Reading First schools. Student achievement comparisons start with this year’s cohort compared to last year (e. g. first grade 2005 - 6 to first grade in 2004 - 2005). This comparison shows the growth in grade level achievement. This analysis is followed by a longitudinal look at students ’ levels of proficiency across the two years of implementation showing the sustainability of last year’s gains. Finally the report examines the impact on fourth grade reading and writing achievement as reflected in statewide assessment results. Fourth grade results indicate the change in school culture (change in teacher practice beyond K- 3) and student readiness (reading ability when they enter 4 th grade). In addition to the focus on student achievement the report describes teacher practice in Reading First schools and analyzes the assessment systems utilized.

40|$|Qualified {{management}} {{aimed at}} optimizing financial results {{is the key}} factor in today's society. Effective management decisions depend on the necessary information about the costs of production process in all its aspects – their structure, types, accounting policies of reflecting costs. General production costs, the so-called indirect costs that are {{not directly related to}} the production process, but provide its functioning in terms of supporting structural divisions and create the necessary conditions of production, {{play a significant role in}} calculating prime costs of goods (works, services). However, the accurate estimate of prime costs of goods (works, services) should be determined with the value of indirect costs (in other words, general production costs), and properly determined with the base of their allocation. The choice of <b>allocation</b> <b>base</b> of general production costs is the significant moment, depending on the nature of business, which must guarantee fair distribution regarding to the largest share of direct expenses in the total structure of production costs. The study finds the essence of general production costs based on the analysis of key definitions of leading Ukrainian economists. The optimal allocation approach of general production costs is to calculate these costs as direct production costs within each subsidiary division (department) separately without selecting a base as the main one to the their total amount. ...|$|E
40|$|In larger organisations with {{multiple}} products (goods or services) {{and more than}} one producing department, the simplistic nature of a single organisational wide overhead rate can distort product costs. If products spend significant time in labour intensive departments, but the organisation-wide absorption/ allocation rate is based on machine hours, then those products' costs will in all probability be distorted. This can adverselv affect costing accuracy control decisions, pricing, and product mix decisions. In order to address these decision-information implications, service department costing tools, techniques and frameworks were developed. The service department costing approach to the allocation of overhead costs recognises the information deficiencies of the organisation-wide allocation rate. It addresses these deficiencies through the use of multiple producing cost centres, each with a specific <b>allocation</b> <b>base.</b> Further, the costs of service departments that support the producing departments are allocated using appropriate bases. However, while this should produce more accurate product costs than the use of a single organisation-wide allocation rate, and hence provide better information for pricing and product-mix decisions, it does result in costs being charged to producing departments over which they have little or no control. This can lead to dysfunctional management and staff behaviour. To address this issue, the technique of activity-based costing (ABC) has been developed (Garrison, Noreen & Brewer, 2006; Drury, 2005; Adams, 1995; Coy & Goh, 1993; Cooper, 1989). This chapter explains the difference between ABC and traditional costing. It then demonstrates and discusses ABC and the management issues associated with its use...|$|E
40|$|The energy usage {{within the}} {{chemical}} cluster in Stenungsund was evaluated by Hackl et al. in a Chalmers report 2010. Subsequently, an improved heat integration system was proposed {{to optimize the}} fossil fuels usage and therefore lower the overall emissions by the cluster and cut energy costs. This thesis {{is the result of}} a case study and aims to evaluate the increased heat integration uncertainties and suggest a cost allocation model. Sustainability and environmental awareness is acknowledged as being fundamental in today’s society. Companies strive to remain their legitimacy on the marketplace and prevent future governmental regulations by keeping pace with technical and societal development. The study is designed as a deductive case study. Data was collected through literature studies and interviews. Uncertainties are evaluated with a SWOT-analysis where strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats connected with the increased heat integration are determined. The results from the SWOT-analysis were considered in order to suggest alternative cost allocation models and different scenarios for further sensitivity analysis. Summary of main findings: The results from the SWOT-analysis show that if the heat integration is implemented, according to a model suggested by Hart and Milstein (2009), the cluster’s sustainable value would increase. From the SWOT-analysis it is also evident that the heat integration system is connected with many risks. However, risks and threats could be avoided or eased with an external third party or if the heat integration is only performed between two of the companies. In those cases the risks and economic benefits would decrease but the companies would still benefit from the enhanced sustainable value but with less cost savings. The potential costs and benefits from the system show an unequal distribution amongst each company. However, using full costing calculation and an <b>allocation</b> <b>base</b> of potential energy savings, which is accepted by the representatives, levels the conditions. Further, the findings in this study indicate that the improved heat integration is seen as a relatively simple technical solution and a cost saver by Chalmers Technical University, while the companies within the cluster is more skeptical and sees it as an expensive, risky investment which will make their production processes more complicated with the proposed system. These gaps in viewpoints have, in our opinion, led to the delay of implementing the system...|$|E
