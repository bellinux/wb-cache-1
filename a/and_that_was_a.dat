25|$|During their research, Eigen and Schuster also {{considered}} types of protein and nucleotide coupling other than hypercycles. One such alternative {{was a model}} with one replicase that performed polymerase functionality <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> translational product {{of one of the}} RNA matrices existing among the quasispecies. This RNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalysed the replication of sequences that had specific motifs recognized by this replicase. The other RNA matrices, or just one of their strands, provided translational products which had specific anticodons and were responsible for unique assignment and transportation of amino acids.|$|E

That same season saw him earn a £2 bonus from the Mayor of Northampton after he and Vallance Jupp skittled Bill Woodfull's Australians, including Donald Bradman, for 93 and made them follow on. Another touring side to fall foul of him were the 1924 South Africans, against whom he claimed 8-96, and Thomas represented the Players against the Gentlemen at Lords in 1928.|$|E

25|$|In 1925 now in Bogotá, de Greiff was now {{a regular}} of the tertulias that {{gathered}} in the Windsor café {{and part of the}} publication of a new vanguard magazine called Los Nuevos (es:The New Ones). Directed by Felipe and Alberto Lleras Camargo, de Greiff worked with other writers such as Jorge Zalamea and Germán Arciniegas among others as regular contributors to the magazine. Los Nuevos was of political, artistic, literary and social content, and aimed to challenge the remnants of exhausted romanticist writings, regionalist politics, and conservative society. This movement followed the path that the panidas had begun in Medellín <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> representation of modernismo in Colombia much like the ultraist movement in Spain.|$|E

The Bank had committed a serious breach of its policies <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> breach of the implied term. The Court dismissed Mr Barker's claims that the policies were incorporated into his contract and that the Bank had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct.

500|$|In {{the final}} days of 2002, when an {{invasion}} of Iraq was still a hypothetical question, Daniels told the New York Times that the cost of war with Iraq “could be” in the range of $50 to $60 billion. [...] It was not clear whether Daniels was referring to the cost of a short invasion or a longer war, but he did indicate the administration was budgeting for both. [...] He also described the “back-of-the-envelope” estimate by Bush Economic Advisor Lawrence B. Lindsey that it would cost $100 to $200 billion as much too high. Two days later, after the New Years Holiday, an OMB spokesperson clarified Daniels’ remarks, adding that the $50 to $60 billion figure was not a hard White House estimate and “it is impossible to know what any military campaign would ultimately cost.

500|$|Negron first {{appears in}} the film's frame story as a bitter, 70-year-old World War II veteran living in Harlem, New York who {{reflects}} on his experiences during World War II. Negron, a black Puerto Rican, is fluent in English, Spanish and Italian, which enables him {{to serve as a}} translator for the Americans and Italians. [...] Alonso first learned of the novel from his agent and read it prior to auditioning for the role. [...] He had to convince Lee that he was fluent in Spanish, and created an audition tape of himself speaking the language, which won him the role. Alonso found difficulty in portraying Negron as an elderly World War II veteran: “This role was very emotionally draining. Ninety percent of the time, the elderly have outlived most of the people they have loved. When I played Negrón as an old man, I had to focus on everything I’ve lost in my life: my dad, friends and love lost, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> really depressing thing to do.” ...|$|E

You {{know how to get}} a reaction – play 'Changes,' 'Golden Years' and they'd be up on their feet. You get the reaction, take the money and run away. It seemed too easy. I didn't want to do that again." [...] In a different contemporary interview he said, [...] "I'm not doing 'Star' again. That was quite hard. I don't think I'm doing much Ziggy material on this tour! [...] Probably use a lot of that mid-70s material, but not the more ponderous things like 'Warszawa.' I tried that, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bit yawn-making.

That's right! Thank god I could remember it! So that for me now is a new song. I've never done that one onstage." [...] "Sons of the Silent Age" [...] was performed every night of the tour.|$|E

Strecker called Quinn [...] "a walking wheeling PSA about texting dangers in general". Dodge said that one of his [...] "favorite scenes" [...] of the episode was [...] "when Artie tries to get Quinn to wheel herself up a steep ramp outside McKinley". VanDerWerff noted the pair's [...] "chemistry" [...] as friends, and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman described [...] "Quinn's kids-in-wheelchairs bonding scenes with Artie" [...] as the [...] "second best thing about the episode". Michael Slezak of TVLine expressed the wish that the extras in the scene in the skateboard park [...] "had actually gotten a chance to, um, speak like real humans, not just like props for a kicky musical number". VanDerWerff's summation was that the episode [...] "gave Dianna Agron more shades to play than she’s usually asked to, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good thing".|$|E
