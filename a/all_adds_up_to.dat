2500|$|David Wilson, {{editor and}} co-creator of the website Wilson & Alroys' Record Reviews, stated that [...] "By 2009, reggaeton had largely run its course, and Vico C wisely retrenched toward the minimalist Latin-ized hip hop of the Xplosión era (title track, with melodramatic but {{effective}} synth strings). There's nothing shockingly innovative like his first successes, {{but by now}} he's experienced enough {{to work with a}} limited palette while still giving each track an individual affect ('Prueba De Farmacia', which somehow manages not to be sappy; the salsified 'Aqui La Que Fallo Fue Usted'). Another of Vico C's strengths is his ability to vary vocal tone and timbre to suit a song: playfully prickly on 'Payasito'; tender on 'Moriré'; commanding on the upbraiding 'Polvora'. He still has an unfortunate tendency to moralize ('El Corazón Se Pone Bruto'; 'Angelina'), but his skills are equally undimmed by time, and though no one tune is a socks-rocker, it <b>all</b> <b>adds</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a satisfying whole." [...] Wilson gave the album 3 stars out of 5.|$|E

Jon Falcone from musicOMH awarded the album {{four and a half}} stars (out of five). Falcone said that Body Talk [...] "shows just how easily she can churn out hits more frequently than labels can process production teams. Robyn deserves her success" [...] stating that [...] "it's impossible to think of a better pop communicator for our time." [...] AllMusic music critic Heather Phares gave the album four stars (out of [...] five). She said that [...] "Releasing that much new music within six months was a feat in and of itself, but the fact that each part of Body Talk was so consistent made the whole project even more impressive." [...] Phares said that the album's appeal [...] "isn’t just experimental: by picking the best of the project’s songs, it feels like a greatest-hits collection and brand new album rolled into one." ...|$|E
