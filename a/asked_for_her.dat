5|$|Weary of {{constantly}} being <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> primary genre, Clarkson had long desired {{to record a}} Christmas album {{as a means to}} defy genre limitations. She commissioned Kurstin, who had studied jazz music under the tutelage of Jaki Byard, to produce the entire album. Drawing inspirations from the soundtracks to the features A Charlie Brown Christmas and White Christmas, as well as the Christmas albums by Mariah Carey, McEntire, and Phil Spector, they experimented on various styles and sounds using Spector's famed Wall of Sound technique to a create a contemporary holiday theme to classics. The Christmas music of Wrapped in Red comprises a variety of genres such as pop, jazz, country, and soul, marking a departure from the pop rock sound established from Clarkson's previous studio albums, while its lyrics share a singular theme of the color red, which represents a plethora of emotions during the holidays.|$|E
5|$|Following {{rumors of}} cast members from Beverly Hills, 90210 {{appearing}} on the spin-off, The CW confirmed that Shannen Doherty, Jennie Garth, Tori Spelling and Joe E. Tata would be returning in recurring roles as their original characters. Sachs was familiar with Garth, and talked to her about a possible role in the series. Garth agreed to star on the series without reading a script after brainstorming ideas with Sachs. The producers offered Garth a role as a series regular, but she opted to sign on as a recurring character. Doherty decided to appear after talking with Sachs, but her appearance {{was moved to the}} second episode. Sachs described Tata's casting as an accident; a friend told Sachs that he had seen Tata in a store, which led to the offer of a recurring role in the series. Sachs said that Tata was ecstatic about the idea and agreed. After reading the script, Spelling expressed interest in returning, and the writers decided to give her character her own fashion line. Spelling was scheduled to appear in the premiere, but due to personal reasons and the birth of her daughter, she opted to appear later in the season. On August 11, it was reported that Spelling had pulled out of the series after discovering that she was receiving less pay than Garth and Doherty. Spelling <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> salary of $20,000 per episode to be increased to match their salaries—$40,000 to $50,000 per episode—but when denied she left the show altogether.|$|E
5|$|In August, {{she began}} a storyline where she acted {{friendly}} and nice, seemingly diminishing her heel characteristics, later shaking {{the hand of}} rival Kaitlyn following a match and teaming with her and Layla on the September 10 episode of Raw. At the Night of Champions pay-per-view, Kaitlyn was attacked and injured by a masked figure backstage, and as a result, she was replaced by Eve in a match against Divas Champion Layla, which Eve won. In doing so, {{she became the first}} ever three-time Divas Champion. After Kaitlyn revealed that her attacker was a blonde, Eve accused Phoenix, attacking her on the September 24 episode of Raw. The following week, pending an investigation into Kaitlyn's attack, Eve suspended Phoenix, which was reversed by Booker T. It was later revealed that Kaitlyn was attacked by Aksana on Eve's orders. At the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view, Eve retained the Divas Championship against Layla and Kaitlyn in a triple threat match. Eve then continued her feud with the duo, facing them in tag team matches with various partners, and defeating Kaitlyn at Survivor Series to retain the championship. At , she defeated Naomi to retain the title. After winning a non-title match against Eve, Kaitlyn went on to defeat Eve by disqualification on December 18, with Eve retaining the championship. A rematch occurred on the January 7, 2013, episode of Raw, in which Eve successfully defended the championship after losing the match via count-out. The following week, Eve dropped the Divas Championship to Kaitlyn. Following the loss, Eve immediately quit WWE in storyline.

The camp authorities became aware of this and warned him that a new trial was probably awaiting him that would have a possible maximum sentence of fifteen years for wrecking Soviet industrial effort by taking workers from their jobs. The bishop was told by a nurse of a woman named Matrionushka in the Volga city of Penza who he should ask to pray for him, and he was told that Matrionushka did not need a letter because she could hear him if he <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> help. He shouted for her help, and the threatened trial did not happen, and he was released several weeks later. He moved to Penza in order to find Matrionushka.

25|$|During {{his time}} at Carleton, Veblen met his first wife, Ellen Rolfe, the niece of the college president. They married in 1888. While some {{scholars}} have attributed his womanizing tendencies to the couple’s numerous separations and eventual divorce in 1911, others have speculated that the relationship's demise was rooted in Ellen’s inability to bear children. Following her death in 1926, {{it was revealed that}} she had <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> autopsy to be sent to Veblen, her then ex-husband. The autopsy showed that Ellen’s reproductive parts had not developed normally, and she had been unable to bear children. A book written by Veblen’s stepdaughter asserted that “this explained her disinterest in a normal wifely relationship with Thorstein” and that he “treated her more like a sister, a loving sister, than a wife”.|$|E
25|$|On April 2011, Hatfield {{announced}} her intention {{to work on}} a new album via fan-funding platform website PledgeMusic, from which she <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> fans to help fund the project in exchange for personal artwork and memorabilia ranging from posters, CDs, demos, one of Juliana's First Act guitars (used during the recording sessions) and even locks of her hair. The project also included donations for the Save a Sato foundation to which Hatfield is a major contributor. Fan response was enthusiastic, going over 400% from the original project cost. The album was originally going to be titled Speeches Delivered to Animals and Plants, in reference to a passage in the John Irving novel The World According to Garp, but later Hatfield herself changed it for the title There's Always Another Girl, in reference to a song in the album of the same name she'd written as a defense for Lindsay Lohan after watching her flop I Know Who Killed Me.|$|E
25|$|Months later, {{after the}} {{forensic}} testing had been inconclusive, FBI agent Ron Butkiewicz {{read the newspaper}} story, contacted O'Malley, and they toured the location together on April 6, 1992.

On April 23–24, 1992, law enforcement teams conducted a full search of the area. They quickly located a matching second sneaker in Timmy's size, and then found the boy's partial skeletal remains in and around a truck tire in Red Root Creek, near pieces of his clothing, a Ninja Turtles balloon, and a blue blanket. His identity was confirmed through dental records, and his death was ruled a homicide, although the time, location, and medical cause of death could not be determined due to advanced decomposition.|$|E

Spelling was scheduled to appear in the premiere, but due to personal reasons and the birth of her daughter, she opted to appear later in the season. Backdrop retail store signage in the first several episodes during shopping excursions scenes and one setup line referring to her role foreshadowed the role that would be unfulfilled.
