5|$|SS Great Britain got our {{unanimous}} {{vote for}} being outstanding at every level. It combines a truly groundbreaking piece of conservation, remarkable engineering <b>and</b> <b>fascinating</b> social history plus a visually stunning ship {{above and below}} the water line.

5|$|In general, humans {{consider}} woodpeckers in a favourable light; {{they are}} viewed as interesting birds <b>and</b> <b>fascinating</b> to watch as they drum or forage. However, their activities are not universally appreciated. Some individual birds habitually excavate holes in buildings, fencing and utility poles, and there are various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters, downspouts, chimneys, vents and aluminium sheeting, that the birds find attractive for drumming. Houses with shingles or wooden boarding are also attractive as possible nesting or roosting sites, especially when close to large trees or woodland. Several exploratory holes may be made, especially at the junctions of vertical boards or {{at the corners of}} tongue-and-groove boarding. The birds may also drill holes in houses as they forage for insect larvae and pupae hidden behind the woodwork.|$|E

5|$|The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter: A Treasury of Myths, Legends, <b>and</b> <b>Fascinating</b> Facts is a {{guide to}} the fictional Harry Potter universe, written by David Colbert. It explores the {{references}} to history, legends, and literature in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels. Colbert conceived the idea for The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter while quizzing his nephew and nieces about the mythological references in the novels. He later wrote the book while teaching a seminar on self-publishing to graduate students at the University of North Carolina. The book was published in March 2001, without approval from Rowling, and has since received positive reviews from critics. An updated version of The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter was published in 2004 by Berkley Books.|$|E

25|$|The {{characters}} in the novel are never defined; they are not created from a mold. Instead, they are developed and formed throughout the novel. All characters are individualized, with many characteristics that differentiate them from others. Ultimately, the novel has a rich imagination achieved by its rhythmic tone, narrative technique, <b>and</b> <b>fascinating</b> character creation, making it a thematic quarry, where the trivial and anecdotal and the historic and political are combined.|$|E

25|$|The most shocking, frightening, <b>and</b> <b>fascinating</b> {{image in}} {{rock in the}} last few years is Courtney Love's stage dive... When some male {{performers}} do it, it looks like muscular, frat-boy fun, controlled aggression... For obvious reasons, the practice was strictly no-girls-allowed, but Love, typically, decided that she wanted to do it, too. Groped, ravaged, she compared the experience to being raped, wrote a song about it, and now does it just about every show.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the areas}} {{covered by the}} old parishes and the later Borough Councils, many of the burials of central/north Victorian London are {{contained}} within the cemetery. Thus it represents a large <b>and</b> <b>fascinating</b> historical cross section of London from the 1850s on. There are tombs of every type and style, with the larger Victorian and Edwardian monuments strategically placed along the main drives (Viaduct Road, Circular Road, and Church Road), and at the main junctions.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} the vessel provide a {{haunting}} <b>and</b> <b>fascinating</b> dive for anybody who ventures onto the site, the large boilers and {{remains of the}} bow and stern also create a unique and interesting dive. The remains are such that one only has to have little knowledge of the vessel to understand what features are present. On top of this, the site is significant simply as a dive site, the abundance of marine life that are present and the features provide a wonderful and popular dive.|$|E

25|$|The temple is {{dedicated}} to Lord Rishabh dev, the first Jain Tirthankara. The temple is very artistic. Its pinnacles, arches, doors, walls are very artistic, beautiful <b>and</b> <b>fascinating.</b> The fifty two pinnacles of the temple are seen from a long distance. The main temple of Atishaya Teerth Kshetra Rishabhanatha is very attractive, magnificent and artistic having 52 beautiful spires on it. It {{is believed to be}} built in 9th century. According to Jain’s opinion, as a symbol of Nandishwar Dweep’s 52 temples, this temple was constructed having 52 spires. This temple is constructed scientifically according to the art of architecture.|$|E
25|$|Lamarr {{went on to}} play {{a number}} of stage roles, {{including}} a starring one in Sissy, a play produced in Vienna, which won accolades from critics. Admirers sent roses to her dressing room {{and tried to get}} backstage to meet her. She sent most of them away, including a man who was more insistent, Friedrich Mandl. He became obsessed with getting to know her. She fell for his charming <b>and</b> <b>fascinating</b> personality, partly due to his immense financial status. Her parents, both of Jewish descent, did not approve, due to Mandl's ties to Mussolini and, later, Hitler, but could not stop the headstrong Hedy.|$|E
25|$|Head's final {{study was}} one of {{degeneration}}, a project {{made all the more}} poignant <b>and</b> <b>fascinating</b> by the fact it was, in part, his own degeneration that he was to be studying. As Parkinson's Disease worked away at his own faculties of speech he combined his knowledge of neurology with his intensive war studies on defects of speech produced by brain injuries to produce two large volumes under the title Aphasia and Kindred Disorders of Speech (1926). These volumes were devoted not only to the clinical or symptomatic aspects of disturbances of speech, but were also an attempt to investigate the psychical processes concerned therein, and the physiological integrations necessary for the comprehension and expression of ideas as language.|$|E

25|$|Numismatists have {{sometimes}} tried to discern a very rigid system of organisation {{in the late}} Anglo-Saxon coinage: one, Michael Dolley, believed that until the death of Cnut in 1035, each type lasted six years, {{with a few exceptions}} – such as the Last Small Cross type at the end of Æthelred’s reign – lasting longer under very unusual conditions. Some features seem to support this belief, at least for the earlier period. Certain changes of type apparently coincided with datable historic events: no coins of the Helmet type survive from the mint of Wilton, for instance, whereas no coins of the preceding Long Cross type are known from nearby Salisbury, but moneyers with the same names as those from Wilton started to operate there in the Helmet type. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 1003 Wilton was sacked by Vikings and the inhabitants retreated to Salisbury, and {{it is likely that the}} change of type coincided with this event. However, there are a number of difficulties with reconstructing such a fixed framework. Not all types are as well represented in the surviving material, and it is clear that this is not always simply a result of a few large hoards distorting our view. There are a number of very small and rare types which were certainly never meant to become fully fledged issues, though some bear a clear relationship to them. Examples from the reign of Æthelred II include the Benediction Hand type and the Intermediate Small Cross type, as well as the famous Agnus Dei type: a unique <b>and</b> <b>fascinating</b> issue on which the king’s portrait and the reverse cross are replaced with, respectively, the Lamb of God and the Holy Dove. The exact context for the production of this very rare coinage is unclear (eighteen specimens survive, as of November 2008): it was only struck at smaller mints, mostly in the midlands, either as an abortive main issue or as a special religious coinage for some specific purpose or occasion. Although the dating is unclear, it may be associated with the Eynsham gathering and the Penitential Edict of 1009. But the difficulties with the sexennial theory are not restricted to smaller, rarer types. The Second Hand type of Æthelred, for example, was not much different in appearance from its predecessor, raising the question of how easily people would have told it and the old coinage apart. More importantly, only minuscule numbers of the type survive from more northerly mints such as Lincoln and York which, in the rest of the period, were some of the most productive in the kingdom. It is possible that the Second Hand type represents a continuation of the First Hand type, which may have run on rather longer than six years as part of a mechanism that did envisage changes of type, but not necessarily on a strict sexennial basis.|$|E

Just when you think you've seen every bit of crazy Jenny can dish out, she digs deep and finds some new neuroticism. She's fragile, but she's steel-spined when it comes to accepting responsibility for the havoc she wreaks in her life and everyone else's." ...|$|E
