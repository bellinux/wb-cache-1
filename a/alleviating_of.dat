40|$|Post-operative {{nausea and}} {{vomiting}} (PONV) is a complication affecting between 20 % and 40 % of all surgery patients, with high-risk patients experiencing rates {{of up to}} 80 %. Recent studies and publications have {{shed light on the}} uses of alternative treatment for PONV, through their modulation of endogenous opioid neuropeptides and neurokinin ligands. In addition to reducing PONV, hypnosis was reported to be useful in attenuating postoperative pain, anxiety, and contributing to hemodynamic stability. Music therapy has been utilized to deepen the sedation level and decrease patient anxiety, antiemetic and analgesic requirements, hospital length of stay, and fatigue. Isopropyl alcohol and peppermint oil aromatherapy have both been used to reduce postoperative nausea. With correct training in traditional Chinese healing techniques, acupuncture (APu) at the P 6 acupoint has also been shown to be useful in preventing early PONV, post-discharge nausea and vomiting, and <b>alleviating</b> <b>of</b> pain. Electro-acupuncture (EAPu), as with APu, provided analgesic and antiemetic effects through release of opioid neuropeptides and modulation.

Since this method inflicts no harm to the patients and due to cultural and environmental effects on the intensity and tolerance of pain, this study was performed to determine the effectiveness of the method on <b>alleviating</b> <b>of</b> labor pain in the province of Chaharmahal & Bakhtiary. TENS was used in 50 nulliparous patients and reduction of pain intensity, duration of delivery as well as patients’ inclination for future use of TENS, were compared to those of a control group that used placebo. Our results showed that there was a marked reduction in the duration of active phase of labor and a higher tolerance of labor pain and a higher inclination for reuse of the method in the case group compared to those of the control group. 52 % of the case group inclined to reuse TENS for future labor. Also there was no significant reduction of labor pain in the case group. It can be concluded that due to the effectiveness of this method, its usage is advisable...|$|E

The inhibitory effect of salinity on mitotic index increased with increasing salt concentrations (0. 00 - control, 0. 25, 0. 275 and 0. 30 M, molar NaCl) {{as compared to}} control group. The mitotic index greatly reduced at the highest salt level (0. 30 M NaCl).

It was determined that application of alone boric acid (0, 005 µM) was not a prohibitive effect on mitotic index {{as compared with the}} barley seeds germinated in distilled water (C, control). Also, the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in application of boric acid increased approximately three-fold according to the control group.

It has been found that ascorbic acid (AA) plays a beneficial role during plant response to chilling and freezing stresses. To evaluate the effects of AA on <b>alleviating</b> <b>of</b> cold stress, the flower buds of Prunus armeniaca L. cv. Shahroudi were sprayed at pink cluster stage with AS at 4 levels (0, 100, 200 and 300 mg. L- 1) and were then exposed to artificial cold stress (4 h at – 4 °C) or without cold stress (+ 25 °C). Experimental attributes including electrolyte leakage (EL) of flower buds and percentage of damage of pistil, anthers and petals to temperature treatments were determined. The results showed that at - 4 °C the lowest and highest percentage of damage and EL of flower buds were observed in application of 200 and 0 mg. L- 1 AA, respectively. The highest and lowest percentage of damage of flower organs and EL were obtained in application of 300 and 200 mg. L- 1 AA, respectively at + 25 °C.

Regarding with anti-inflammatory effects of sesame, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of sesame butter-supplemented breakfast in comparison to common breakfast on the severity of primary dysmenorrhea in the students of Ahvaz University of Medical Science. Subject and Method: In this clinical trial, 60 female single students (18 - 25 years old) with dysmenorrheal were randomly divided into case and control groups. Subjects in the case group were treated with sesame butter-supplemented breakfast from 2 days before menses to 3 days after it, for 2 consecutive months. In the control group, the subjects were asked to eat common breakfast. Menstrual, anthropometric and dietary parameters were assessed and analyzed statistically.

Being the planners, designers, conductors and philosophers of sustainable aquaculture, human beings always demand their further improvement at level best from their current positions to bring supreme success in the sector. As sustainable aquaculture is socio-economic –cum-environmental in concept, its operation and management requires constant interplay of various human knowledge for ensuring its smooth direction and for achieving its goal. So, the arrangement of different types and levels of training and education are the great need for the development of personnel involved in sustainable aquaculture route and also for growing awareness of environmental issues. The modus operandi of training and education has to be changed systematically to answer the calls of the needs of the new millennium.

40|$|Pre-induction of {{heme oxygenase}} (HO) - 1, which is {{regarded}} as an effective method of "organ preconditioning", exerts beneficial effects during hemorrhagic shock (HS). However, the available HO- 1 inducers exhibit disadvantages such as toxicity or complex technical requirements. Therefore, a safe and convenient HO- 1 inducer would be promising and could be exploited {{in the treatment of}} foreseeable hemorrhaging, such as prior to major surgery. Here we investigated the effect of vitamin C (VitC), a common antioxidant, on intestinal HO- 1 expression and examined whether VitC pretreatment prevented HS related intestinal tissue injuries after HO- 1 induction. First, we conducted an in vitro study and found that HO- 1 expression in rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC- 6) was induced by non-toxic VitC in a time and concentration dependent manner, and the mechanism was related to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2). Next, we conducted an in vivo study and found that VitC induced intestinal HO- 1 protein expression (mainly observed in the intestinal epithelial cells) and HO- 1 activity in normal SD rats, and that these HO- 1 levels were further enhanced by VitC in a rat model of HS. The HS related intestinal injuries, including histological damage, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (tumor necrosis factor and interleukin- 6), neutrophil infiltration and apoptosis decreased after VitC pretreatment, and this <b>alleviating</b> <b>of</b> organ injuries was abrogated after the inhibition of HO- 1 activity by zinc protoporphyrin-IX. It was of note that VitC did little histological damage to the intestine of the sham rats.
