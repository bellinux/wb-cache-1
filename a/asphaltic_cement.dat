40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to characterize the <b>asphaltic</b> <b>cement</b> penetration grade 30 / 45 (CAP 30 / 45) based on the morphology of nanostructures called "bee" structure observed and its modification when the binder was diluted in heptanes or toluene. The morphology of CAP 30 / 45, toluene and heptane films was studied by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) tapping mode and showed typical "bee" structure in <b>asphaltic</b> <b>cement</b> films, but this structure is not visible on the other films. While, toluene completely dissolved the bees, films attacked with heptane still presented some structures left...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} rubblizing {{existing}} concrete pavement {{prior to the}} placement of an <b>asphaltic</b> <b>cement</b> concrete overlay {{has been around for}} several years and, in fact, has been tried successfully in the states of New York, Michigan, and Ohio. With available construction and maintenance dollars usually not meeting the demands of the needed work, much of the necessary rehabilitation of existing Portland cement concrete pavements is not being completed when it would be most beneficial. Research project HR- 315, "Iowa Development of Rubblized Concrete", has been undertaken {{to determine the effects of}} rubblized concrete pavement base as it affects the cracking pattern and longevity of the ACC overlay...|$|E
40|$|State Highway Departments {{and local}} street and road {{agencies}} are currently faced with aging highway systems {{and a need}} to {{extend the life of}} some of the pavements. The agency engineer should have the opportunity to explore the use of multiple surface types in the selection of a preferred rehabilitation strategy. This study was designed to look at the portland cement concrete overlay alternative and especially the design of overlays for existing composite (portland cement and <b>asphaltic</b> <b>cement</b> concrete) pavements. Existing design procedures for portland cement concrete overlays deal primarily with an existing asphaltic concrete pavement with an underlying granular base or stabilized base. This study reviewed those design methods and moved {{to the development of a}} design for overlays of composite pavements. It deals directly with existing portland cement concrete pavements that have been overlaid with successive asphaltic concrete overlays and are in need of another overlay due to poor performance of the existing surface. The results of this study provide the engineer with a way to use existing deflection technology coupled with materials testing and a combination of existing overlay design methods to determine the design thickness of the portland cement concrete overlay. The design methodology provides guidance for the engineer, from the evaluation of the existing pavement condition through the construction of the overlay. It also provides a structural analysis of various joint and widening patterns on the performance of such designs. This work provides the engineer with a portland cement concrete overlay solution to composite pavements or conventional asphaltic concrete pavements that are in need of surface rehabilitation...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{spectral}} analysis of surface wave tests {{were performed on}} <b>asphaltic</b> and <b>cement</b> concrete pavements by dropping freely a 6. 5 kg spherical mass, having a radius of 5. 82 cm, from a height (h) of 0. 51. 5 m. The maximum wavelength ((max)), up to which the shear wave velocity profile can be detected with the usage of surface wave measurements, increases continuously {{with an increase in}} h. As compared to the asphaltic pavement, the values of (max) and (min) become greater for the chosen cement concrete pavement, where (min) refers to the minimum wavelength. With h= 0. 5 m, a good assessment of the top layers of both the present chosen <b>asphaltic</b> and the <b>cement</b> concrete pavements, including soil subgrade, can be made. For a given h, as compared to the selected asphaltic pavement, the first receiver in case of the chosen cement concrete pavement needs to be placed at a greater distance from the source. Inverse analysis has also been performed to characterise the shear wave velocity profile of different layers of the pavements...|$|R
40|$|The recycle of old asphaltic {{concrete}} material (OAC) with cement additive {{is a relatively}} new pavement improvement method in road geotechnical engineering in Thailand. This paper describes the test results of recycled old {{asphaltic concrete}} mixed with various amounts of cement additive (OACC) at different durations of curing time, compared to the OAC without any additive. The test results show that the strength of OACC increases with the increase in amount of cement additive. A multiple regression model was developed for predicting the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of the recycled old <b>asphaltic</b> concrete with <b>cement</b> additive (OACC) using cement content and curing time as input. The performance evaluations showed that predictions by the multiple regression model are very satisfactory in estimating the UCS...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} work {{undertaken in}} the demonstration of a low-cost Automatic Weight and Classification System (AWACS). An AWACS procurement specification and details {{of the results of}} the project are also included. The intent of the project is to support and encourage transferring research knowledge to state and local agencies and manufacturers through field demonstrations. Presently available, Weigh-in-Motion and Classification Systems are typically too expensive to permit the wide deployment necessary to obtain representative vehicle data. Piezo electric technology has been used in the United Kingdom and Europe and is believed to be the basic element in a low-cost AWACS. Low-cost systems have been installed at two sites, one in Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) pavement in Iowa and the other in <b>Asphaltic</b> <b>Cement</b> Concrete (ACC) pavement in Minnesota to provide experience with both types of pavement. The systems provide axle weights, gross vehicle weight, axle spacing, vehicle classification, vehicle speed, vehicle count, and time of arrival. In addition, system self-calibration and a method to predict contact tire pressure is included in the system design. The study has shown that in the PCC pavement, the AWACS is capable of meeting the needs of state and federal highway agencies, producing accuracies comparable to many current commercial WIM devices. This is being achieved at a procurement cost of substantially less than currently available equipment. In the ACC pavement the accuracies were less than those observed in the PCC pavement which is concluded to result from a low pavement rigidity at this site. Further work is needed to assess the AWACS performance at a range of sites in ACC pavements...|$|E

40|$|The {{shape of}} aggregates, from {{whatever}} source, plays {{a crucial role}} in determining the properties of the composite material in which they are embedded (e. g., <b>asphaltic</b> or portland <b>cement</b> concrete). To properly characterize this three-dimensional shape, three-dimensional information is needed. We show how this kind of information can be acquired via x-ray computed tomography. Mathematical “burning ” algorithms can be applied to a multi-aggregate image to extract individual particles of various sizes. A spherical harmonic mathematical analysis can then be used to completely characterize the three-dimensional shape of each extracted aggregate. This real shape information can then be incorporated into algorithms for simulating the rheology of suspensions (fresh concrete or other materials) and into algorithms for simulating the structure of portland cement concrete. _____________________________________________________________________________...|$|R
40|$|For {{ecological}} and economic reasons, there has {{in recent years}} been an increased tendency also to use broken-up asphalt {{in the manufacture of}} asphalt mixes. In the case of broken-up materials having higher tar contents, this is possible only with the aid of cold-processing methods. For this reason, the environmental compatibility and practical applicability of two of these methods were tested in experiments in the laboratory and on site. Use of granulated material having pure tar as a binder created a very critical boundary condition in terms of the material composition. The leached contents of harmful substances from granulated material with pure tar also showed that, for water conservation reasons, such a material cannot be used unbound. After binding of such tarry broken-up road materials with <b>asphaltic</b> emulsion and <b>cement,</b> or cement alone, the leaching is reduced, with the result that such construction material mixtures can be placed in base courses above a frost blanket course.
