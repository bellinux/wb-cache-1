50|$|<b>A</b> <b>widow's</b> peak is <b>a</b> V-shaped {{point in}} the {{hairline}} {{in the center of}} the forehead. Hair growth on the forehead is suppressed in a bilateral pair of periorbital fields. Without <b>a</b> <b>widow's</b> peak, these fields join in the middle of the forehead so as to give a hairline that runs straight across. <b>A</b> <b>widow's</b> peak results when the point of intersection on the forehead of the upper perimeters of these fields is lower than usual.|$|R

5|$|The parishes {{were grouped}} into deaneries called Varados. Every parish {{was divided into}} wards, while Parish Councils were present in most parishes. About 15 percent of the {{households}} in the parishes were literate. <b>A</b> <b>widow</b> had to remain indoors, practically {{for the rest of}} her life. Since high-caste Hindu widows cannot remarry after the death of their husbands, the high-caste Christians too considered the remarriage of <b>a</b> <b>widow</b> as something unnatural. Canon law did allow remarriage for widows and therefore there was no direct prohibition for widows to remarry in the society of the Christians of South Canara. Few women had the courage to go against the strict conventions of their community. <b>A</b> <b>widow</b> who remarried was looked down upon, pitied, and shunned as unlucky. But she was not ill-treated or made an outcast, and no stigma was attached to her husband. Succession to property was practised as per the Hindu laws.|$|E

However, the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary and Sergey Solovyov say that Zotov {{came up with the idea}} to marry Pashkova in 1714, and that his plan to become a monk was merely a joke.|$|E

5|$|By {{the eighteenth}} century many poorer girls were being taught in dame schools, informally set up by <b>a</b> <b>widow</b> or {{spinster}} to teach reading, sewing and cooking. Among the nobility there were many educated and cultured women. Women formed {{an important part of}} the workforce. Many unmarried women worked away from their families as farm servants, and married women worked with their husbands around the farm, taking part in all major agricultural tasks. They had a particular role as shearers in the harvest, forming most of the reaping team of the bandwin. Women also played an important part in the expanding textile industries, spinning and setting up warps for men to weave. There is evidence of single women engaging in independent economic activity, particularly for widows, who can be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading. Some were highly successful, such as Janet Flockhart, an Edinburgh Wadwife or moneylender, who had been left <b>a</b> <b>widow</b> with seven children after her third husband's suicide, and who managed her business affairs so successfully that she amassed a moveable estate of £22,000 by her death in the late sixteenth century. Lower down the social scale, the rolls of poor relief indicate that large numbers of widows with children endured a marginal existence.|$|E
5|$|Carroll {{improved}} his fortunes through a judicious marriage. In November 1689, he wed Martha Ridgely Underwood, <b>a</b> <b>widow</b> whose two former husbands {{had left her}} a small fortune. Carroll inherited a portion of this fortune after Martha's death in 1690 in childbirth. The child, named Anthony in honor of Carroll's brother, also died. Restricted in his law practice by the new Protestant government, Carroll used the inheritance to begin importing goods to the colony. He also purchased a store {{in the town of}} Annapolis.|$|E

Having destroyed the male element (Purusha) in the universe, she is left with nothing, but she is still Shakti, the female element with latent energy. Dhumavati's insatiable hunger and thirst is highlighted in many texts, and has been interpreted as the manifestation of her unsatisfied desires.|$|E
