5|$|The {{banking system}} of Belarus {{consists}} of two level: Central Bank (National Bank of the Republic of Belarus) and 25 commercial banks. On 23 May 2011, the Belarusian ruble depreciated 56% against the United States dollar. The depreciation was even steeper {{on the black market}} and financial collapse seemed imminent as citizens rushed to exchange their rubles for dollars, euros, durable goods, <b>and</b> <b>canned</b> goods. On 1 June 2011, Belarus requested an economic rescue package from the International Monetary Fund.|$|E

After doing so, a boarding party with Japanese officers in a launch headed to Montanan. When the American identity of Montanan was established {{to the satisfaction of}} the Japanese, they returned to their ship without boarding Montanan. The news report did not identify the type or the name of the Japanese warship, which had been searching for a German vessel thought to be operating in the area.|$|E

However, by 2100UTC on November20, the hurricane warning was downgraded to {{a tropical}} storm warning. It was further downgraded to {{a tropical storm}} watch and discontinued by November22. Other than hurricane/tropical storm watches and warnings, a flash flood warning was also posted on November20, and sailors were advised to remain at port. Disaster committees cautioned residents {{to stock up on}} supplies such as batteries <b>and</b> <b>canned</b> food. At 1500UTC on November20, a hurricane watch was issued for Haiti and areas east of Camagüey, Cuba, though it was downgraded to a tropical storm watch six hours later.

5|$|In October 2011, Heineken {{sold the}} McEwan's beer brands to Wells & Young's for around £20 million, and {{production}} of McEwan's Best Scotch <b>and</b> <b>canned</b> and bottled brands moved to Bedford. The new owners vowed to reintroduce McEwan's as a cask ale brand and launch an expanded premium bottled range. Together with the Younger's brands McEwan's generates £80 million of sales annually in the UK, and McEwan's is now the largest Wells & Young's brand. It is the highest-selling ale brand in Scotland where it has a 20 per cent market share. Like most largely pasteurised ale brands in the UK {{it has been in}} a state of managed decline. The beers are sold predominantly in Scotland and the north of England; a small amount is exported to Italy. 2012 saw the launch of McEwan's Export in bottles, and a new seasonal cask-conditioned golden ale called McEwan's Gold. In 2013, export sales to Canada were resumed, having been discontinued under Heineken. In April 2013 McEwan's Red was launched, aimed at younger drinkers and with the intention of expanding the brand into England. McEwan's beers began to be sold in France in April 2013. The bottled beers McEwan's Amber and Signature were launched in July 2013.|$|E
5|$|Selling and {{purchasing}} fresh false morels {{is legal}} in Finland, {{where it is}} highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are {{required by law to}} be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared <b>and</b> <b>canned,</b> in which case they are ready to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9tonnes in 2006 and 32.7tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in butter in a saucepan, flour and milk added to make a bechamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill and black pepper.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, then-Philippine {{president}} Joseph Estrada declared six provinces as a {{state of}} calamity, which allocated ₱1million in emergency funds for each province. The president was unable to return home {{from a trip to}} Singapore due to the storm. The military was activated to help organize relief efforts, using rubber boats and trucks to reach the hardest hit areas as floodwaters decreased. They were aided by the Philippine Red Cross and other government agencies. Most evacuees returned home after the storm passed, excluding those whose houses sustained damage. Volunteers, the military, and public workers helped clean up from the damage. Just seven days after Zeb's damaging Philippine landfall, another typhoon—Babs—struck the same general region with a similar, but lesser intensity. After both storms, the Philippine National Electrification Administration provided ₱1.78million to the Batanes Electric Cooperative to restore damaged power lines. Power was gradually restored in northeastern Luzon, allowing communication of the damage extent. The nation's Department of Health distributed ₱547,469 worth of medicine to four provinces. The government airlifted about 3,000bags of supplies to Cagayan that included rice <b>and</b> <b>canned</b> goods. The back to back storm impacts caused an estimated 30% drop in coconut exports. Food prices rose dramatically, in some instances up to 400%, after both storms damaged crops. The storms also delayed shipments of sugar from neighboring countries, although prices were expected to fall once they arrived. By December 1998, consumer prices had risen by 11.2% over the previous year due to the typhoons' damage.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the formal}} 1971 Oregon Bottle Bill, Oregon had already {{set up a}} less formal bottle return system that most stores {{and some of the}} public cooperated with. Inspired by the early Vermont bottle return system before it was repealed, Oregon's limited system paid 1 cent for beer bottles <b>and</b> <b>cans</b> <b>and</b> 3 cents for soda bottles <b>and</b> <b>cans,</b> <b>and</b> was started in the mid-1950s, and lasted {{through the rest of the}} 50s, {{throughout}} the 1960s and into the early 70s until the more formal and expanded Bottle Bill was enacted. The emphasis was on bottles, as bottlers were washed and re-used for fresh product sold to the public before health laws were enacted that stopped the re-wash system. And because of the low payout for the return of bottles <b>and</b> <b>cans,</b> <b>and</b> in spite of various anti-litter PSA advertising campaigns on Oregon television, only a relatively small percentage of Oregonians participated in the return of bottles <b>and</b> <b>cans,</b> <b>and</b> thus many bottles <b>and</b> <b>cans</b> still littered Oregon's highways and scenic areas throughout this entire early bottle-can recycling period.|$|R
