40|$|A {{methodology}} for quantitative chemical {{analysis of the}} complex “borohydride-borate-hydroxide-carbonate-water” mixtures used as fuel in the borohydride fuel cell was developed and optimized. The methodology includes the combined usage of the acid-base and iodometric titration methods. The acid-base titration method, which simultaneously uses the technique of differentiation and computer simulation of titration curves, allows one to determine the contents of hydroxide (alkali), carbonate, and total “borate + borohydride” content. The iodometric titration method allows one to selectively determine borohydride, so the content of each of OH-, BH 4 -, BO 2 -, and CO 32 - anions in the fuel becomes estimated. The <b>average</b> <b>determination</b> error depends on the number and ratio of compounds in a mixture. Specific details of the analysis of various fuel mixtures are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Numerous age-related pathologies {{affect the}} {{prostate}} gland, the most menacing {{of which is}} prostate cancer (PCa). The diagnostic tools for prostate investigation are invasive, requiring biopsies when PCa is suspected. Novel dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (DCE-US) imaging approaches have been proposed recently and appear promising for minimally invasive localization of PCa. Ultrasound imaging of the prostate is traditionally performed with a transrectal probe because {{the location of the}} prostate allows for high-resolution images using high-frequency transducers. However, DCE-US imaging requires lower frequencies to induce bubble resonance and, thus, improve contrast-to-tissue ratio. For this reason, in this study we investigate the feasibility of quantitative DCE-US imaging of the prostate via the abdomen. The study included 10 patients (age = 60. 7 ± 5. 7 y) referred for a needle biopsy study. After having given informed consent, patients underwent DCE-US with both transabdominal and transrectal probes. Time–intensity contrast curves were derived using both approaches and their model-fit quality was compared. Although further improvements are expected by optimization of the transabdominal settings, the results of transabdominal and transrectal DCE-US are closely comparable, confirming the feasibility of transabdominal DCE-US; transabdominal curve fitting revealed an <b>average</b> <b>determination</b> coefficient r 2 = 0. 91 (r 2 2 ̆ 6 gt; 0. 75 for 78. 6...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{the main}} honey {{producing}} countries require accurate labeling of honey before commercialization, including floral classification. Traditionally, this classification {{is made by}} melissopalynology analysis, an accurate but time-consuming task requiring laborious sample pre-treatment and high-skilled technicians. In this work the potential use of a potentiometric electronic tongue for pollinic assessment is evaluated, using monofloral and polyfloral honeys. The results showed that after splitting honeys according to color (white, amber and dark), the novel methodology enabled quantifying the relative percentage of the main pollens (Castanea sp., Echium sp., Erica sp., Eucaliptus sp., Lavandula sp., Prunus sp., Rubus sp. and Trifolium sp.). Multiple linear regression models were established {{for each type of}} pollen, based on the best sensors sub-sets selected using the simulated annealing algorithm. To minimize the overfitting risk, a repeated K-fold cross-validation procedure was implemented, ensuring that at least 10 - 20 % of the honeys were used for internal validation. With this approach, a minimum <b>average</b> <b>determination</b> coefficient of 0. 91 ± 0. 15 was obtained. Also, the proposed technique enabled the correct classification of 92 % and 100 % of monofloral and polyfloral honeys, respectively. The quite satisfactory performance of the novel procedure for quantifying the relative pollen frequency may envisage its applicability for honey labeling and geographical origin identification. Nevertheless, this approach is not a full alternative to the traditional melissopalynologic analysis; it may be seen as a practical complementary tool for preliminary honey floral classification, leaving only problematic cases for pollinic evaluation.

40|$|The {{utilization}} of tannery sludge in agricultural areas {{can be an}} alternative for its disposal and recycling. Despite this procedure may cause the loss of nitrogen by ammonia volatilization, there is no information about this process in tropical soils. For two years a field experiment {{was carried out in}} Rolandia (Parana State, Brazil), to evaluate the amount of NH(3) volatilization due to tannery sludge application on agricultural soil. The doses of total N applied varied from zero to 1200 kg ha(- 1), maintained at the surface for 89 days, as usual in this region. The alkalinity of the tannery sludge used was equivalent to between 262 and 361 g CaCO(3) per kg. Michaelis-Menten equation was adequate to estimate NH(3) -N volatilization kinetics. The relation between total nitrogen applied as tannery sludge and the potentially volatilized NH(3) -N, calculated by the chemical-kinetics equation resulted in an <b>average</b> <b>determination</b> coefficient of 0. 87 (P > 0. 01). In this period, the amount of volatilized NH(3) was more intense during the first 30 days; the time to reach half of the maximum NH(3) volatilization (K(m)) was 13 an 9 days for the first and second experiments, respectively. The total loss as ammonia in the whole period corresponded in average to 17. 5 % of the total N applied and to 35 % of the NH(4) (+) -N present in the sludge. If tannery sludge is to be surface applied to supply N for crops, the amounts lost as NH(3) must be taken into consideration. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|The Optimal Band Ratio Analysis (OBRA) {{could be}} {{considered}} as an efficient technique for bathymetry from optical imagery due to its robustness on substrate variability. This point receives more attention for very shallow rivers where different substrate types can contribute remarkably into total at-sensor radiance. The OBRA examines the total possible pairs of spectral bands {{in order to identify}} the optimal two-band ratio that its log transformation yields a strong linear relation with field measured water depths. This paper aims at investigating the effectiveness of additional spectral bands of newly launched WorldView- 3 (WV- 3) imagery in the visible and NIR spectrum through OBRA for retrieving water depths in shallow rivers. In this regard, the OBRA is performed on a WV- 3 image as well as a GeoEye image of a small Alpine river in Italy. In-situ depths are gathered in two river reaches using a precise GPS device. In each testing scenario, 50 % of the field data is used for calibration of the model and the remained as independent check points for accuracy assessment. In general, the effect of changes in water depth is highly pronounced in longer wavelengths (i. e. NIR) due to high and rapid absorption of light in this spectrum {{as long as it is}} not saturated. As the studied river is shallow, NIR portion of the spectrum has not been reduced so much not to reach the riverbed; making use of the observed radiance over this spectral range as denominator has shown a strong correlation through OBRA. More specifically, tightly focused channels of red-edge, NIR- 1 and NIR- 2 provide a wealth of choices for OBRA rather than a single NIR band of conventional 4 -band images (e. g. GeoEye). This advantage of WV- 3 images is outstanding as well for choosing the optimal numerator of the ratio model. Coastal-blue and yellow bands of WV- 3 are identified as proper numerators while only green band of the GeoEye image contributed to a reliable correlation of image derived values and field measured depths. According to the results, the additional and narrow spectral bands of WV- 3 image lead to an <b>average</b> <b>determination</b> coefficient of 67 % in two river segments, which is 10 % higher than that of obtained from the 4 -band GeoEye image.
