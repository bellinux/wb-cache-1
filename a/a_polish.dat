5000|$|The {{other form}} of lapping {{involves}} a softer material such as pitch or a ceramic for the lap, which is [...] "charged" [...] with the abrasive. The lap is then used to cut a harder material — the workpiece. The abrasive embeds within the softer material, which holds it and permits it to score across and cut the harder material. Taken to a finer limit, this will produce <b>a</b> <b>polished</b> surface such as with <b>a</b> <b>polishing</b> cloth on <b>an</b> automobile, or <b>a</b> <b>polishing</b> cloth or polishing pitch upon glass or steel.|$|R

In the pursuit of <b>a</b> <b>polished</b> and thus slicker surface for a plough, he experimented with portions of saw blades and by 1837, he was making polished, cast steel ploughs. The energy effort required was lessened, which enabled the use of larger ploughs, making more effective use of horse power.|$|R
