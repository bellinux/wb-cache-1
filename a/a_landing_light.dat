50|$|In the United States, for example, {{landing lights}} are not {{required}} or used for many types of aircraft, but their use is strongly encouraged, both for take-off and landing and during any operations below 10,000 ft or within ten nautical miles of an airport (FAA AIM 4-3-23). According to CFR 14 and FAR Part 91.205, <b>a</b> <b>landing</b> <b>light</b> is required for all aircraft used in commercial operations at night.|$|E

50|$|On {{the fifth}} of June, 1958, Booth {{was killed when}} the {{experimental}} rocket-powered Saunders-Roe SR.53 he was test-flying suffered a failure of its rocket engine and overrun the runway at Boscombe Down. During the accident, the SR.53 hit <b>a</b> <b>landing</b> <b>light,</b> rupturing its fuel tanks and burst into flames, Booth being killed in the fire. A few days following the accident, Booth was posthumously awarded the Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air.|$|E
50|$|In 1940, Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels publicised {{the fact}} that a new fighter was {{entering}} service with the Luftwaffe. The plan involved taking pictures of Heinkel He 100 D-1s at different air bases around Germany, each time sporting a new paint job for various fictional fighter groups. The pictures were then published in the press with the He 113 name, sometimes billed as night fighters (even though they did not even have <b>a</b> <b>landing</b> <b>light).</b>|$|E

50|$|The Vigilant T1 is the {{designation}} of the adapted Grob 109B used by the Royal Air Force (RAF) for use on Volunteer Gliding Squadrons. Modifications to the Vigilant T1 include <b>a</b> <b>landing</b> <b>light,</b> a higher maximum all up mass (AUM) of 908 kg and a throttle {{for use in the}} left hand seat. The initial order for 53 was topped up by aircraft bought in the private market, before being reduced to 15 in 2016. It is anticipated that these relaunched gliders will be disposed of in October 2019.|$|E
50|$|Initially, the Anson {{was flown}} with a three-man crew, which {{comprised}} a pilot, a navigator/bomb-aimer and a radio operator/gunner, {{when it was}} used in the maritime reconnaissance role; from 1938 onwards, it was typically operated by a four-man crew. The bomb-aimer would perform his function from a prone position in the forward section of the nose, which was provisioned with a bombsight, driftsight, and other appropriate instrumentation, including <b>a</b> <b>landing</b> <b>light.</b> The pilot was located in a cockpit behind the bomb-aimer's position and was provided with a variety of contemporary instrumentation, including those to enable flight under instrument flight rules (IFR) and indirect instrument lighting for night flying purposes.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the Magister paid close {{attention}} to simplicity of operation; as such, a minimum amount of procedures were necessary prior to take-off. Accessibility to both the engines and onboard equipment for servicing was above average; {{it was possible for}} both of the type's Marbore engines could be swapped out within the space of 45 minutes. Provision was made for the installation of a pair of 7.5 mm guns upon the aircraft's nose, which included a 200-round ammunition box for each cannon and the ability to collect both links and cases. Underwing hard points could be used to hold up to four rockets or a pair of 110 lb bombs. <b>A</b> <b>landing</b> <b>light</b> was installed in the tip of the nose while a retractable taxiing light was installed upon the Messier-built nosewheel. The landing gear was satisfactory for operationsfrom austere grass airstrips.|$|E

60|$|<b>A</b> <b>light</b> <b>land</b> breeze was blowing, and {{the ship}} had been worked through the harbor's mouth under scant sail, but now that they had cleared the point every {{available}} shred of canvas was being spread that she might stand out to sea as handily as possible.|$|R
50|$|The Brodie <b>landing</b> {{system was}} <b>a</b> method of <b>landing</b> <b>light</b> {{aeroplane}} devised by James H Brodie, a Captain of the United States Air Force during World War II. The method of <b>landing</b> involved catching <b>a</b> hook {{attached to the}} plane with a sling which itself was attached to a cable. This system proved useful in landing aircraft in normally unsuitable terrain, such as the jungle or in mountains, and also afforded good camouflage.|$|R
60|$|It {{was nearly}} an hour after midnight that Nick Gunn, kicking off his shoes, went stealthily out onto the <b>landing.</b> <b>A</b> little <b>light</b> came from the partly {{open door of the}} sick-room, but all else was in blackness. He moved along and peered in.|$|R
5000|$|On December 28, 1978, United Airlines Flight 173, a Douglas DC-8-61 {{en route}} from Denver, Colorado, to Portland, Oregon, {{experienced}} <b>a</b> <b>landing</b> gear indicator <b>light</b> malfunction while preparing to land. The aircraft continued to circle {{in the vicinity of}} Portland while the crew investigated the problem, but it ran out of fuel and crash-landed in a sparsely populated area, killing 10 and seriously injuring 24 of the 181 on board.|$|R
5000|$|Jonatan and Karl {{set up a}} {{camp for}} the night, and Jonatan {{explains}} that during their flight he was burned by Katla's fire {{and that he will}} soon die. Jonatan tells Karl about the land that lies after Nangijala called Nangilima, <b>a</b> <b>land</b> of <b>light</b> where there are only happy adventures. Karl {{does not want to be}} separated again from his brother, so he carries him on his back to a cliffdrop. Karl makes the jump, vowing never to be afraid again, but is cut off as they reach the bottom of the gorge. Then the narrative jump-cuts to Karl crying out jubilantly: [...] "Oh, Nangilima! Yes, Jonatan, yes - I see the light! I see the light!" ...|$|R
50|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Second World War , French Fighter and Supply Planes coming from the Far East (India, China and Vietnam) used the El Mina basin as <b>a</b> <b>landing</b> area. Significantly <b>lighter</b> weight than sailboats, the local current within the basin caused {{problems}} and then El Mina Mayor Kheireddine Abdul Wahab was given the contract to construct the first man made break water which {{marked the beginning of the}} Tripoli Harbor.|$|R
50|$|The {{challenging}} {{production schedule}} meant that flight {{tests of the}} DH.88 commenced just six weeks {{prior to the start}} of the race. During testing, the propeller blade roots were found to interfere unacceptably with the airflow into the engine. Instead, a two-position variable pitch type, manufactured by French manufacturer Ratier, was substituted. These blades were manually set to fine pitch before takeoff using a bicycle pump, and in flight they were repositioned automatically to coarse (high-speed) pitch by a pressure sensor. A drawback was that the propellers could not be reset to fine pitch except on the ground. Other changes included the installation of <b>a</b> large <b>landing</b> <b>light</b> fitted in the nose and a revised, higher profile to the cockpit to give the pilot marginally less restricted visibility.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} the class date to World War I and the very first tanks; {{designed}} to operate in close concert with the infantry and facing both artillery and the first dedicated anti-tank guns, early tanks had to have enough armour {{to allow them to}} survive in no man's <b>land.</b> <b>As</b> <b>lighter</b> tanks were introduced, the larger designs became known as heavies. A similar 'breakthrough' role remained into World War II.|$|R
50|$|Captained by pilot Robert Linquist, {{assisted}} by co-pilot Ernest Hill and stewardess Mary Burke, the aircraft ended its Miami-San Juan leg at 19:40 EST on 27 December. Linquist informed local repair crewmen that <b>a</b> <b>landing</b> gear warning <b>light</b> was not functioning {{and that the}} aircraft batteries were discharged and low on water. Unwilling to delay the aircraft's scheduled takeoff for Miami for several hours, Linquist said the batteries would be recharged by the aircraft's generators en route.|$|R
5|$|A {{large number}} of bombers only began {{receiving}} their warning and diversion orders at 00:45 hours. Halifaxes of No. 4 Group were finally alerted at this time. It {{was too late to}} prevent the Ju 88s from sighting, and then homing in on <b>a</b> mass of <b>landing</b> <b>lights.</b> Crews from NJG 2 and NJG 4 were able to deliver beam and Schräge Musik attacks against the unwary crews. Pilots that were alerted in time were able to carry out a corkscrew manoeuvre, and evade the attack. Some bombers were able to land but were then subjected to strafing attacks and destroyed though the crews were presented with a greater chance to escape.|$|R
500|$|In the 1950s, the Penobscot Nation {{had hired}} {{a lawyer to}} {{research}} the possibility of <b>a</b> <b>land</b> claim. In <b>light</b> of the Eisenhower administration's Indian termination policy, counsel opined that [...] "obtaining a fair hearing of their claim would be virtually impossible." [...] Up until the 1960s, Maine continued to fulfill certain provisions of the 1794 treaty, including the periodic provision of 150 yards of blue cloth, 400 pounds of powder, 100 bushels of salt, 36 hats, and a barrel of rum. By 1964, of the [...] reservation, [...] had been diverted to other purposes and only [...] remained under tribal control.|$|R
50|$|The United States Navy {{purchased}} {{the island in}} 1919 and razed most structures on it, leaving only the lighthouse and building piers and <b>a</b> <b>landing</b> strip. The <b>light</b> was automated in 1932 and left unattended, gradually decaying over the next twenty years. Fire gutted the structure on July 16, 1956; to this day, {{the cause of the}} blaze is uncertain, but many suspect that a stray artillery round fired from the proving ground at Dahlgren, Virginia, may have been to blame. In any event, the Navy viewed the shell as a hazard and ordered it razed.|$|R
5000|$|After a {{break of}} more than three and <b>a</b> half months, <b>Landing</b> <b>Light</b> {{returned}} in the Cesarewitch Handicap over two and a quarter miles at Newmarket Racecourse in October. Ridden by the veteran Pat Eddery, who had never won the race, he carried 130 pounds and started at odds of 12/1 {{in a field of}} thirty-six runners. Eddery held the horse up in the early stages before moving forward three furlongs from the finish. He took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by two and a half lengths from the Scottish challenger Sun Bird. After the race, Eddery, who had already announced that he would retire {{at the end of the}} season, said [...] "I'd tried to win it for the last 25 years and been placed in it quite a bit but never actually won it. It's hard to get on the right horse but luckily I was on the right one". <b>Landing</b> <b>Light</b> suffered from leg problems in the later part of 2003 and missed all of the 2004/2005 season. He was officially retired from racing in July 2005.|$|R
5000|$|In 1933, Forsythe and C. Alfred [...] "Chief" [...] Anderson {{were the}} first black pilots to make a round-trip {{cross-country}} flight from Atlantic City, New Jersey, to Los Angeles, California. They made the cross country journey in a Fairchild 24 named [...] "The Pride of Atlantic City." [...] The plane was not equipped with parachuts, <b>a</b> radio or <b>landing</b> <b>lights,</b> and they navigated using a road map. Later that same year, the two {{became the first black}} pilots to fly across an international border to Montreal, Canada. In 1934, Forsythe and Anderson bought a of aircraft and christened it the [...] "Booker T. Washington," [...] in which they flew their Southamerican Good Will Flight. During this tour, the duo accomplished several ground-breaking feats in the caribbean.|$|R

[...] Three seconds later, Eagle landed and Armstrong said [...] "Shutdown." [...] Aldrin immediately said [...] "Okay, engine stop. ACA – out of detent." [...] Armstrong acknowledged [...] "Out of detent. Auto" [...] and Aldrin continued [...] "Mode control – both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm – off. 413 is in." ...|$|R
50|$|Fortunately {{there was}} a field on the farm big enough upon which to <b>land</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> {{aircraft}} so Winifred built a wooden hangar and moved her Moth from Stag Lane. During this period Winifred, Hugh and Frank resided at No. 4, South Drive in Wokingham. Winifred continued her Air-Taxi Service, charging £4 an hour or one shilling a mile, covering Britain and France, and gave flying lessons. She also purchased a car. Wokingham locals recall her {{being one of the}} first woman drivers in the area. Some time later she moved to Scott's Farm near Bearwood, now part of Woosehill.|$|R
