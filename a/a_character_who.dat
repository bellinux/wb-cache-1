5|$|After Naomi (Marsha Thomason) parachuted {{onto the}} island in season three, the {{producers}} began to plan who else {{would be on the}} freighter she came from. They wanted these new characters to be scientists, who would be interested in finding the island for their own personal reasons. They decided to create <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>who</b> would be interested in lost civilizations, and named her Charlotte Staples Lewis as a reference to C. S. Lewis, which Lost producer Damon Lindelof said was a clue to the direction the show would be taking during season four.|$|E

Cranitch had previously appeared in several other dramas as Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) operators.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{appeared}} in other {{television and radio}} shows, including Just a Minute and, from 1992 until 1998, {{playing the role of}} GamesMaster in the television show of the same name: <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>who</b> professed to know {{everything there is to know}} about video gaming. He would issue video game challenges and answered questions on cheats and tips. The show's host, Dominik Diamond, claimed that Moore did not understand anything that he said on the show, yet managed to record his contributions in single takes.|$|E
5|$|Terry George was {{the first}} {{director}} to join the project, and he also did some revisions to the script, but he soon left the project. Peter Berg was the next director to consider, but he too, eventually dropped out for undisclosed reasons. A year later {{it was confirmed that}} Phillip Noyce would direct. Noyce was attracted to Salt for its espionage themes, which are present in most of his filmography, as well as the tension of <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>who</b> tries to prove his innocence yet also does what he was previously accused of.|$|E

5|$|The Landlord, {{the leader}} of Thongs and Octopus, is played by Michael Hui, a Hong Kong Film Award-winning comedic actor who starred in various box office hits from 1970s to 1990s before emigrating to Canada shortly before the {{handover}} of Hong Kong. Hui was chosen for the part {{because he is the}} ideal actor to play <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>who</b> persuades others to do bad things. The producers had originally intended Hui to fight along with Chan and Koo, however, it was eventually decided that Hui would simply act as the brains of the gang.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} {{of her first}} novel cast a standard for Affinity to follow, which Waters consciously made darker, set in a women's prison with <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>who</b> connects with spirits of the dead. Waters found it daunting to follow the success of Tipping the Velvet and reviewers marked {{the differences in the}} main characters: where Nan adventurously seeks out and states her desires, Margaret in Affinity is compelled by desire, but internally struggles with it.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} reasons for showing Oscar's head and {{shoulders}} within the frame during the flashback scenes, rather than letting the camera be the character's eyes. The first was {{that this is the}} way Noé usually sees himself in dreams and when recalling past events. He also thought it would be easier for the viewer to care about <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>who</b> is visible, as many point-of-view films, in his opinion, look unintentionally funny.|$|E

5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{identified}} several instances {{in the story}} that he argued linked to wider themes within the Adventures of Tintin. He identified a recurring host-and-guest theme in Alembick's visit to Syldavia, and believed that the theme of thieving was present in the story as Alembick's identity is stolen. Another theme identified within the series by McCarthy {{was that of the}} blurring between the sacred and the political; he saw echoes of this in King Ottokar's Sceptre as the King has to wait three days before appearing to the Syldavian public on St. Vladimir's Day, something that McCarthy thought linked to Jesus Christ and the Resurrection. McCarthy also opined that a number of characters in the book visually resembled Captain Haddock, <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>who</b> would be introduced in the subsequent Tintin adventure, The Crab with the Golden Claws.|$|E
5|$|On December 18, 1993, Dragon Quest II was remade and {{combined}} with Dragon Quest {{as part of}} Dragon Quest I & II for the Super Famicom, which used Dragon Quest Vs engine. Besides enhanced in graphics and sound, gameplay was also improved. The Super Famicom remake features an improved enemy targeting system: if an enemy is defeated before <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>who</b> was assigned to attack can perform its attack move, the character will attack another enemy rather than do nothing like in the Famicom version. And like its successors, players can find stat-improving items from pots or dressers. The Super Famicom remake was only released in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The Kids in the Hall: Death Comes to Town (or simply Death Comes to Town) is an eight-episode Canadian mini-series that {{aired on}} CBC Television on Tuesdays between January 12 and March 16, 2010. The show {{takes place in}} a fictional Ontario town called Shuckton where their mayor has been murdered. As the Shuckton {{residents}} cope with the loss, a new lawyer moves in to prosecute a suspect – though another resident, unsatisfied with the evidence, tries to find the real killer. At the same time, <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>who</b> is a personification of death waits at a motel room for the latest Shuckton residents to die.|$|E

5|$|Hergé {{incorporated}} several characters {{into the}} story who had previously been introduced in earlier Adventures; this included Dr. Müller, a German villain who had previously appeared in The Black Island, and the Portuguese merchant Oliviera da Figueira, who had first appeared in Cigars of the Pharaoh. Hergé also included {{a reference to the}} recurring character Bianca Castafiore, whose singing appears on the radio in one scene. He also introduced a number of new characters in the story; this included the Emir Ben Kalish Ezab, <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>who</b> was based largely on Ibn Saud, the king of Saudi Arabia, whom Hergé had learned about from a 1939 book by Anton Zischke. It has also been suggested that the character was partly inspired by the deceased Iraqi leader, Faisal I. The character of the Emir's son, Prince Abdullah, was inspired by the King of Iraq, Faisal II, who was appointed monarch in 1939 aged four, although in creating this character Hergé had also been influenced by an obnoxious child character that appears in the work of O. Henry.|$|E
5|$|In {{discussing}} the more lighthearted {{elements of the}} plot, such as Dr. Morris, <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>who</b> tells corny jokes, the developers commented that these elements accentuated the dark elements of the game rather than detracted from them, as well as showing {{the stability of the}} survivors' mental conditions. The decision to include more dialogue than previous entries in the series was to ensure that this new world and the new characters were understandable by the player, though the developers acknowledge that it could also distract from the strategic gameplay. The developers felt that the dialogue made the story more enjoyable for the players, as opposed to being a vehicle to move the gameplay forward. When asked if Days of Ruin was an attempt to bridge this series with fellow Intelligent Systems series Fire Emblem, developers commented that while the increase in volume may make it seem like this, it was not their intention. They explained that while Fire Emblem placed importance on individual units, Advance Wars was about improving as a commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts is {{influenced}} by its parent franchise, Final Fantasy, and carries gameplay elements over into its own action-based, hack and slash system. The main battle party consists of three characters: Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy. Sora is directly controlled by the player from a third person camera angle. All other party members are computer-controlled, though the player can customize their behavior to an extent through the pause menu. Donald and Goofy comprise the party in most areas, but nearly every level features <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>who</b> may replace them. For instance, Jack Skellington can join Sora's party in Halloween Town, but cannot accompany the player elsewhere. In some worlds, the party changes its appearance, has abilities unique to that world or both, can fly in Neverland, acquire aquatic forms in Atlantica which enable them to survive underwater, and gain Halloween costumes in Halloween Town {{to blend in with}} the locals.|$|E

5|$|Reynolds {{believes}} The Sun Also Rises {{could only}} have been written in 1925: it perfectly captured the period between World WarI and the Great Depression, and immortalized a group of characters. In the years since its publication, the novel has been criticized for its anti-Semitism, as expressed in the characterization of Robert Cohn. Reynolds explains that although the publishers complained to Hemingway about his description of bulls, they allowed his use of Jewish epithets, which showed the degree to which anti-Semitism was accepted in the US after World WarI. Cohn represented the Jewish establishment and contemporary readers would have understood this from his description. Hemingway clearly makes Cohn unlikeable not only as a character but as <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>who</b> is Jewish. Critics of the 1970s and 1980s considered Hemingway to be misogynistic and homophobic; by the 1990s his work, including The Sun Also Rises, began to receive critical reconsideration by female scholars.|$|E
5|$|A {{hallmark}} of director Sir Ridley Scott {{is the theme}} of artificial intelligence present in his science fiction films. Scott's earliest foray into the philosophy of artificial intelligence was with the android character Ash, in the original Alien film released in 1979. Ian Holm portrayed Ash as <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>who</b> may uncannily assume a human form, yet he maintains a sense of superiority that is only humbled {{by the nature of the}} Alien, which runs counter to the very future of the human race. In the book The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott, the authors- Adam Barkman, Ashley Barkman and Nancy Kang- reason that though Ash is designed to appear human, his innards are bio-mechanical and he himself does not presume to be a sentient being with a semblance of life, but an artificial construct whose personality is dictated by machinery. Every subsequent installment in the Alien film series directed by Scott features at least one synthetic (android) character designated to maintain order aboard their respective space ship. In 2017, Scott explained that the synthetics featured in the Alien films he directed are designed to subvert their robotic nature and to impeccably mimic humans. The original form of androids introduced in Alien would contradict the observable nature of David in Prometheus; though both would serve the same corporate masters and have the same non-human innards, David would identify himself as a sentient entity who is capable of expressing - if not feeling - emotion.|$|E
5|$|Many {{aspects of}} the play are drawn from Fielding's own experiences. During Act II, the {{characters}} Marplay and Sparkish, two theatre managers, offer poor advice to Luckless {{on how to improve}} his play, which they then reject. This fictional event mirrors Fielding's own life when Colley Cibber and Robert Wilks of the Theatre Royal rejected The Temple Beau. Cibber was an inspiration for the character of Marplay and Wilks for Sparkish, but Sparkish does not appear in the revised version of 1734, after Wilks's death. In his place Fielding introduces <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>who</b> mocks Theophilus Cibber, Colley's son, and his role in the Actor Rebellion of 1733. Another biographical parallel involves the relationship between Luckless and Mrs Moneywood, which is similar to Fielding's own relationship with Jan Oson, his landlord during his stay in Leiden in early 1729. There Fielding incurred a debt of about £13 (equivalent to about £1,760 as of 2008), and a legal case was brought against him. Abandoning his personal property, Fielding fled to London; Oson's seizure of Fielding's possessions mirrors Mrs Moneywood's threats to seize those belonging to Luckless. Other characters are modelled on well-known personalities of whom Fielding was aware though they were not personal acquaintances:: Mrs Novel is Eliza Haywood, a writer, actress, and publisher; Signior Opera is Senesino, a famous Italian contralto castrato; Bookweight is similar to Edmund Curll, a bookseller and publisher known for unscrupulous publication and publicity; Orator is John Henley, a clergyman, entertainer, and well-known orator; Monsieur Pantomime is John Rich, a director and theatre manager; and Don Tragedio is Lewis Theobald, an editor and author. Sir Farcical Comick is another version of Colley Cibber, but only in his role as an entertainer.|$|E
