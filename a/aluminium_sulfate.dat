25|$|In {{order to}} obtain alum from alunite, it is {{calcined}} and then exposed to the action of air for a considerable time. During this exposure it is kept continually moistened with water, so that it ultimately falls to a very fine powder. This powder is then lixiviated with hot water, the liquor decanted, and the alum allowed to crystallize. The alum schists employed {{in the manufacture of}} alum are mixtures of iron pyrite, aluminium silicate and various bituminous substances, and are found in upper Bavaria, Bohemia, Belgium, and Scotland. These are either roasted or exposed to the weathering action of the air. In the roasting process, sulfuric acid is formed and acts on the clay to form <b>aluminium</b> <b>sulfate,</b> a similar condition of affairs being produced during weathering. The mass is now systematically extracted with water, and a solution of <b>aluminium</b> <b>sulfate</b> of specific gravity 1.16 is prepared. This solution is allowed to stand for some time (in order that any calcium sulfate and basic ferric sulfate may separate), and is then evaporated until ferrous sulfate crystallizes on cooling; it is then drawn off and evaporated until it attains a specific gravity of 1.40. It is now allowed to stand for some time, decanted from any sediment, and finally mixed with the calculated quantity of potassium sulfate, well agitated, and the alum is thrown down as a finely divided precipitate of alum meal. If much iron should be present in the shale then it is preferable to use potassium chloride in place of potassium sulfate.|$|E

40|$|Greenhouse pot {{experiments}} were conducted over 13 months {{to evaluate the}} effect of two amendment mixture doses (30 and 75 Mg/ha) on the geochemical dispersion of trace elements by leaching hazardous mine wastes from the Sao Domingos mine. Mineralogical evolution of these materials was also evaluated. Amendment mixtures containing solid wastes from agriculture (plant remains + strawberry substrate and rocicwool used for the strawberry crop) and from distillation of Ceratonia siliqua Land Arbutus unedo L fruits were used to improve the chemical characteristics of leachates from sulfide mine wastes. Sulfide mine wastes had acidic characteristics, as well as high electrical conductivity and total element concentrations (g/kg; AI: 54. 8 - 612; Fe: 104. 0 - 110. 0; Pb: 9. 0 - 13. 8; S: 63. 6 - 68. 0; As: approximate to 1). These features contributed to the large capacity for leaching of hazardous elements during, at least, {{the first four months}} of incubation. In the seventh month of incubation, there was a significant decrease in the leachate concentration of the majority of hazardous elements. The addition of amendments minimised trace element dispersion in leachate percolation during the first seven months (25 to 99 % reduction compared to control, depending on the element and sampling period). However, the leachate characteristics were not influenced by amendment doses and no significant differences were observed in leachate composition (control and amended treatments) after 13 months. Amendment application led to differences between the solid phases of the efflorescent salts formed {{on the surface of the}} control and the amended treatments.

40|$|Silica is {{detrimental}} to the recovery of zinc from zinc bearing siliceous materials. The difficulties involved in the hydrometallurgical processing of silica are well documented, the major problem being the formation of gels. These are extremely difficult to separate from solution, creating serious problems. This work investigates the mechanism {{of the formation of}} granular silica precipitates and how this differs from the mechanism of formation of the gels. Batch precipitation studies of silica from sulfuric acid solutions have revealed valuable information about the processes occurring. A solution of monosilicic acid (Si(OH) 4 (subscript)) was produced by leaching synthetic zinc orthosilicate (Zn 2 SiO 4) in sulfuric acid. Precipitation was monitored by measuring the turbidity and silica concentration in solution at regular intervals. Electron microscopy was used to examine the precipitate morphology. Variables known to influence silica precipitation are supersaturation, temperature, seeding and the concentrations of sulfuric and hydrofluoric acids and zinc, iron (III) and <b>aluminium</b> <b>sulfates.</b> These were investigated by comparing their effects on precipitation with those of a control experiment. The evaluation criteria used were induction time, precipitation rate, precipitation time, product morphology and filterability. The results of this work define conditions that yield a granular silica precipitate in preference to a gel, low supersaturation being the most important condition. The product morphology is insensitive to precipitation rate over the range of conditions studied. A laboratory scale continuous crystalliser was designed and constructed and used to carry out a series of experiments to determine the operating conditions for suitable processing of natural zinc orthosilicate ore to remove the silica impurity in an easily separable form. The variables examined were ++supersaturation as well as mixing and product removal conditions. The relationship between supersaturation and morphology discovered during the batch experiments was confirmed to also occur when employing a continuous basis.
