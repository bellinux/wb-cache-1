He also {{played a significant role in}} developing mechanical engineering into a professional degree program, with a focus on ethics, design and testing, analysis and problem solving, and mathematics.|$|E

2500|$|While only {{students}} with severe impairments attend classes {{on the main}} campus, other special education {{students with}} less required assistance attend self-contained classrooms {{in the public school}} system, where they are able to partake in general education {{to the best of their}} abilities. [...] These students are technically enrolled through the ISD but may be placed in any of the nine public school districts, where they may earn their high school diploma from the school they attend. [...] The ISD provides services to these students and also employs the special education teachers and aides. [...] The ISD leases classrooms from other schools to use for special education students. [...] All ISD classrooms are required to have a certified aide who assists the teacher <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom,</b> and the number of students in each class is very low compared to other classes. [...] The ISD also oversees classrooms and teachers at the Monroe County Youth Center.|$|E
2500|$|For many, education’s {{purpose is}} to train {{students}} for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job. [...] As Dewey notes, this limited vocational view is also applied to teacher training schools who attempt to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline skills needed {{to meet the needs}} of the employer and demands of the workforce (Dewey, 1904). [...] For Dewey, the school <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> teacher, as a workforce and provider of a social service, have a unique responsibility to produce psychological and social goods that will lead to both present and future social progress. [...] As Dewey notes, [...] "The business of the teacher is to produce a higher standard of intelligence in the community, and the object of the public school system is to make as large as possible the number of those who possess this intelligence. [...] Skill, ability to act wisely and effectively in a great variety of occupations and situations, is a sign and a criterion of the degree of civilization that a society has reached. [...] It is the business of teachers to help in producing the many kinds of skill needed in contemporary life. [...] If teachers are up to their work, they also aid in production of character(Dewey, TAP, 2010, pp. 241–42).|$|E
