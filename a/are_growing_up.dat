25|$|In {{an article}} for the Daily Mail, Nawaz notes how self-segregation has created Muslim {{communities}} in London where third-generation teenagers <b>are</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> without having any non-Muslim friends, or friends from the opposite sex. He notes how their lives revolve around faith schools, mosque, Islamic extracurricular activities and cultural events involving members of the Muslim community only. Without any exposure to the complexities of modern life, he argues, such teens are susceptible to simplistic worldviews and dogma. On an individual level, Nawaz maps a person's path to radicalisation with four key stages: grievances, identity crisis, charismatic recruiter and ideology. It begins {{with a sense of}} real or perceived grievances, which leads to an identity crisis. This condition is then capitalised on by a recruiter from an organisation who lays out the ideology as a solution to that individual's alienation.|$|E

He was regarded as [...] "one of the ablest and most enthusiastic advocates of the new 'California of the South'". For many years Widney advocated the division of {{the state of}} California into at least two states, in order to maximize its representation in the U.S. Senate. He indicated in 1880 that [...] "the topography, geography, climatic and commercial laws all work for the separation of California into two distinct civil organizations". In 1888, Widney said that [...] "two distinct peoples <b>are</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in the state, and the time is rapidly drawing near when the separation which the working of natural laws is making in the people must become a separation of civil laws as well".|$|E
500|$|University {{lecturer}} Zaini Ujang viewed Yesterday and Todays comparisons as {{criticisms of}} society, putting forth {{the question of}} whether people should accept [...] "development" [...] to simply mean discarding the old for the new without regards to its value. [...] Professor Fuziah of the National University of Malaysia interpreted the book's ending as a wakeup call to parents, questioning them if they should deny their children a more relaxed childhood. [...] Lent agreed, saying that Lat had asserted the theme from the start, showing him and his childhood friends [...] "not in a hurry to grow up". [...] Redza hinted that Lat's other goal was to point out the [...] "dehumanising environment" [...] that Malaysian urban children <b>are</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in. [...] A Japanese edition of Yesterday and Today was published by Berita Publishing in 1998.|$|E

500|$|Originally called Maple Point School, {{the schoolhouse}} was {{commissioned}} by first farm director, Kenneth McKenzie, to provide education {{for the children of}} farm employees. [...] This was to be the third school constructed in the colony of Vancouver Island, following Governor James Douglas' call [...] "to give a proper moral and religious training to the children of the settlers who <b>are</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in ignorance and the utter neglect of all their duties to God and society." [...] The need was judged to be most severe for children of Protestant denomination, as Roman Catholics received (until 1851) [...] "very able and zealous" [...] instruction from a priest from the Society des Oblats. [...] Construction was commenced, using timber milled on the farm, in August 1854 and continued until late February 1855. [...] The first students took classes there in March of the same year, and were charged a fee of between 30 shillings and 1 pound.|$|E
500|$|Anna Popplewell as Susan Pevensie, {{the second}} oldest Pevensie. Popplewell had been {{disappointed}} she barely used her {{bow and arrow}} in the first film. Adamson convinced Douglas Gresham to have her present during the battles by suggesting her passive role in the novel indicated Lewis' view of women before he met Joy Gresham. [...] "I think [...] cast women down in the earlier books, {{but when you look}} at The Horse and His Boy, it has a strong female character. Doug's mother was a strong woman." [...] Adamson also chose to have her fall for Caspian, because [...] "The kids <b>are</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> If you look at Ben and you look at Anna, it seems really implausible that they wouldn't have some feelings for each other." [...] He knew it had to be [...] "sensitively handled" [...] though, and ultimately it is not about romance, but [...] " [...] the fact that you can have a wondrous experience, enjoy it and move on". Popplewell added that it would not make sense for the Narnians not to use Susan, a talented archer, in battle, and that the romance contributed to her character's reconciliation with losing Narnia in the first place.|$|E

[...] Tamar Antai also of MTV said, [...] "Usher {{does most of the}} heavy lifting where dancing is concerned, and Justin Bieber, who's more of a singer than a dancer, is in no danger of upstaging Usher on the dance floor." [...] Antai compared Bieber's moves to Usher in his [...] "Caught Up" [...] video, commenting [...] "it's nice to see Justin expanding the scope of talents to include pelvic thrusts, Matrix-style slo-mo leans" [...] and, [...] "it's also nice to see Justin looking a little more mature and sophisticated in a hoodie and leather jacket....and his videos <b>are</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> with him, as this is his flashiest, most grandiose video yet.
