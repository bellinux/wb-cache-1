40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{examples}} of architectural design of converting <b>active</b> <b>solar</b> <b>house</b> to {{passive solar house}} together with some considerations about the consequences are presented. The first one is MIT Solar House IV built in 1957 and the data acquisition was completed in 1961, when the house {{was determined to be}} sold as an ordinary house. The author was engaged in making the conversion design by removing 55 m 2 of solar collector to provide a partial extension of living room with south facing opening for direct solar heat gain. The second one is K Solar House built in 1972 with 16 units of sliding vertical solar collector of 1. 6 m 2 each. These were replaced by glass block wall and sliding insulation panels with a low emissivity glass pane. The wood framings of original collector units were reused and the original aluminium framings for glass as collector glazing cover were unchanged...|$|E

40|$|Korea is sparse energy reserves, {{and over}} 97 % {{of the total}} energy it consumes is imported. Furthermore, fossil fuels {{comprise}} more than 80 % of the total energy consumed in Korea, resulting in the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming. The building sector {{is one of the}} major energy-consuming sectors in Korea. The energy consumption of the buildings in the country represents about 24 % of the total energy consumption of the whole nation, and it is on the rise due to the continued growth of the Korean economy. The energy use of buildings is dependent on a wide variety of interacting features that define the performance of the building system. Many different research buildings that utilize several kinds of energy conservation technologies were constructed in KIER, in Taeduk Science Town, to provide feedback regarding the most effective energy conservation technologies. This paper intends to introduce the energy conservation technologies of new residential <b>houses,</b> passive and <b>active</b> <b>solar</b> <b>houses,</b> super-low-energy office buildings, "green buildings," and "zero-energy houses," whose utilization will help protect the quality of the environment and conserve energy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{new concept}} for <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>houses</b> is {{presented}} within this paper. In contrast to existing <b>solar</b> <b>house</b> solutions, the <b>solar</b> collec- tor heat gains are distributed in a temperature-optimized way to three different heat sinks – a significantly smaller storage tank, concrete floor elements directly {{fed by the}} solar circuit and a ground heat exchanger which also serves as the heat source of a heat pump, which is the backup heater. This new layout should reduce the today's usual extra system costs of <b>solar</b> <b>houses</b> by about 25 %. System simulations prove the functionality of the concept and show even higher solar fractions and energy savings as simulated for the existing <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>house</b> concept. One of the main components in the new concept is the controller which has to decide which heat sink will be charged. A control strategy was developed which evaluates the potential outputs of the collector opera- ting to each heat sink. Simulations allow determining the optimal control parameters for this approach. While the thermal activa- tion is able to compensate the decreasing solar input to the smaller storage tank, {{the effects of the}} regeneration of the ground heat exchanger are significantly smaller. However, the regeneration avoids a long-term temperature decrease in the ground and may allow a reduction of the heat exchanger area...|$|R

5000|$|Although earlier {{experimental}} <b>solar</b> <b>houses</b> {{were constructed}} using {{a mixture of}} <b>active</b> and passive <b>solar</b> techniques, {{some of the first}} European engineered passive <b>solar</b> <b>houses</b> of the modern era were built in Germany after World War I, when the Allies occupied the Ruhr area, including most of Germany's coal mines. [...] Architect George F. Keck was a pioneering designer of passive <b>solar</b> <b>houses</b> in the 1930s and 40s. He designed the all-glass [...] "House of Tomorrow" [...] for the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago and noted that it was warm inside on sunny winter days prior to the installation of the furnace. Following this he gradually started incorporating more south-facing windows into his designs for other clients, and in 1940 designed a passive solar home for real estate developer Howard Sloan in Glenview, Illinois. The Sloan House was called a [...] "solar house" [...] by the Chicago Tribune, the first modern use of that term. Sloan then built a number of passive <b>solar</b> <b>houses,</b> and his publicity efforts contributed to a significant [...] "solar house" [...] movement in the 1940s.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} a field {{investigation}} on indoor environment at a rural passive <b>solar</b> <b>house</b> in Yushu City, Jilin Province in the severe cold region of China. The air temperature and relative humidity at the <b>solar</b> <b>house</b> were monitored from Dec. 15 th, 2014 to Mar. 15 th, 2015. During the period, the authors went to the <b>solar</b> <b>house</b> every 3 or 4 weeks, manually measuring the air temperature, relative humidity, air speed, globe temperature and surface temperatures of exterior window and Kang. Besides the <b>solar</b> <b>house,</b> three energy-saving houses and two old rural houses were investigated. Peasants’ thermal responses were surveyed by questionnaires at the meantime. The {{results showed that the}} mean indoor air temperature of the <b>solar</b> <b>house</b> was 13. 7 °C, close to the design temperature of 14 °C for rural houses in the severe cold areas of China. And the mean temperature of an old rural house monitored was only 10. 5 °C. The average relative humidity was 65. 3 % at the <b>solar</b> <b>house,</b> while it was 90. 9 % at the old rural house. Peasants in the <b>solar</b> <b>house</b> and energy-saving houses commonly felt warm, while peasants in the old houses mostly felt neutral or cool. So the solar walls had a positive effect on improving indoor thermal environment.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess the post {{occupancy}} evaluation of passive <b>solar</b> <b>houses</b> and address the limitations of previous research. First, the sample size was large enough to allow for statistical analysis; second, hypotheses. were tested; and third, an understanding of sources of information and overall satisfaction, areas of satisfaction and problems with passive <b>solar</b> <b>houses,</b> was gained. Data from "Post Occupancy Evaluation of Passive Solar Homes in Oregon," were used for this study. Mail questionnaires were received from 93 respondents who were living in passive <b>solar</b> <b>houses.</b> Chi square statistical tests were used to test relationships between information sources and overall satisfaction, areas of satisfaction and problems with passive <b>solar</b> <b>houses.</b> Based on the results of the Chi square tests, significant relationships were found between: a) the use of magazines and Energy Extension agents as sources of information and the overall satisfaction of living in passive <b>solar</b> <b>houses,</b> b) the area of satisfaction with interior decorating in a passive <b>solar</b> <b>house</b> and the use of books, magazines, architects and builders as informational sources, c) the use of magazines as a source of information and the areas of satisfaction with energy savings, effort and time required to maintain, and overheating of a passive <b>solar</b> <b>house,</b> d) the problem of adequate shading of a passive <b>solar</b> <b>house</b> by deciduous trees and the use of magazines and Energy Extension agents as a source of information, and e) the problem of high windows and other glass areas cleaned and the use of architects as sources of information. The post occupancy evaluation process is based on occupant experience with solar design and allows time for occupants to assess the specific successes and/or failures of the system.
