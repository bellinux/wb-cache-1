5|$|Fairman {{discusses}} {{the efforts of}} conservatives in the United States to censor the word from common parlance in the country, and says these acts <b>are</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Fairman warns against a tendency toward self-censorship. He explains that those who choose to silence themselves tacitly encourage a process by which speech is forbidden through the legal process. He argues that this passivity has an impact of increasing the taboo nature of the word.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} maggots such as blowfly larvae (gentles) and {{bluebottle}} larvae (casters) are bred commercially; they are sold as bait in angling, and as food for carnivorous animals (kept as pets, in zoos, or for research) such as some mammals, fishes, reptiles, and birds It {{has been suggested}} that fly larvae could be used at a large scale as food for farmed chickens, pigs, and fish. However, consumers <b>are</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inclusion of insects in their food, and the use of insects in animal feed remains illegal in areas such as the European Union.|$|E

25|$|The Seventh-day Adventist church {{stands in}} the Wesleyan {{tradition}} (which in turn {{is an expression of}} Arminianism) in regard to its soteriological teachings.

25|$|Many Democrats <b>are</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> use {{of torture}} against {{individuals}} apprehended and held prisoner by the U.S. military, and hold that categorizing such prisoners as unlawful combatants does not release the U.S. from its {{obligations under the}} Geneva Conventions. Democrats contend that torture is inhumane, decreases the United States' moral standing in the world, and produces questionable results. Democrats largely spoke out against waterboarding.|$|E
25|$|Many {{animal welfare}} and animal rights {{organizations}} <b>are</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> use of wild animals in circuses. Many {{of these groups}} actively campaign against circuses by staging protests outside of venues over alleged animal rights violations.

After parents accused the Sodalitium of brainwashing their son and separating him from his parents, the movement opened its doors to the press {{for the first time in}} 2003. Young members were reported as laughing at talk of brainwashng, and said that they had been evangelised, not captured, as teenagers.|$|E

Many people who live along the line support the conversion to a trail or back to a rail line. Many others, whose properties abut the ROW, <b>are</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ROW's redevelopment in any manner. A number of properties adjacent to the right-of-way have expanded their property fences over sections of the former right-of-way, without acquiring the rights to the land.|$|E

25|$|Since {{independence}}, the Montenegrin {{society has}} been divided among many issues. The independence supporters are advocating {{for the creation of}} a separate Montenegrin language, regarded before as a dialect of the Serbian language, including the creation of a new Montenegrin Cyrillic alphabet which is basically the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet with the addition of two new letters. The Serbian population of Montenegro is opposed to the idea of a linguistic separation, just as they <b>are</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> separation of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church from the jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The Montenegrin language lacks ISO code, and the Montenegrin Orthodox church is canonically unrecognized.|$|E
25|$|All laws in Canada are the monarch's and the {{sovereign}} {{is one of}} the three components of parliament—formally called the Queen-in-Parliament—but the monarch and viceroy do not participate in the legislative process save for the granting of Royal Assent, which is necessary for a bill to be enacted as law. Either figure or a delegate may perform this task and the constitution allows the viceroy the option of deferring assent to {{the sovereign}}. The governor general is further responsible for summoning the House of Commons, while either the viceroy or monarch can prorogue and dissolve the legislature, after which the governor general usually calls for a general election. The new parliamentary session is marked by either the monarch, governor general, or some other representative reading the Speech from the Throne. Members of Parliament must recite the Oath of Allegiance before they may take their seat. Further, the official opposition is traditionally dubbed as Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, illustrating that, while its members <b>are</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> incumbent government, they remain loyal to the sovereign (as personification of the state and its authority).|$|E
25|$|I {{have further}} shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the {{horticulturist}} and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part {{in the evolution of}} society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It strikes me that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which <b>are</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sympathies of their associates.|$|E

[...] The war {{eventually}} devastates the planet, and a Decepticon scientist named Thunderwing suggests to graft Transformers with protective organic shells, which Megatron rejects. Thunderwing experiments on himself, becoming a beast who devastates Cybertron. The Decepticons recover more quickly and stage a new offensive against the Autobots, who suffer {{the loss of the}} charismatic Blaster, the voice of the Autobot resistance: he is shot and set adrift in space by a traitor.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the February plenum of 1957, which was seen as {{directly}} rebuffing many post-Stalin Soviet views, the Soviet leadership invited Hoxha to visit Moscow in April that year allegedly for consultations. Instead, Khrushchev called on Hoxha to rehabilitate and reinstate party members who had been sacked for their support of Yugoslavia and the theses of the 20th Party Congress; Hoxha refused. In response to this Khrushchev accused Hoxha of sectarianism and of being [...] "hell-bent on pursuing Stalinist policies." [...] Hoxha later recalled the meeting as follows: Khrushchev advised the Albanians to improve their relations with Yugoslavia, to which Hoxha replied, [...] "We have always wanted to have good relations with Yugoslavia, but to put it bluntly, we do not trust the Yugoslav leaders, because they speak against the social system in our countries and <b>are</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foundations of Marxism-Leninism. In all their propaganda, they do not say one word against imperialism, on the contrary, [...] have joined the chorus of the Western powers against us." [...] He once more said that the Yugoslav leadership failed to understand [...] "any of its grave mistakes and deviations," [...] to which Khrushchev replied that Yugoslavia did not betray Marxism–Leninism though it had [...] "slipped" [...] from its positions. [...] "According to you," [...] Khrushchev continued, [...] "we ought to return to what Stalin did, which caused all these things we know about." [...] The meeting became increasingly acrimonious and when the subject of rehabilitating disgraced Albanian politicians came up Khrushchev eventually concluded, [...] "You are like Stalin who killed people," [...] to which Hoxha replied, [...] "Stalin killed traitors, and we kill them, too." ...|$|E
