50|$|Magnetic {{variation}} is different {{depending on the}} geographic position on the globe. The Magnetic North Pole is currently in Northern Canada and is moving generally South. A straight line {{can be drawn from}} the Geographic North Pole, down to the Magnetic North Pole and then drawn straight down to the equator. This line is known as the <b>agonic</b> <b>line,</b> and the line is also moving. In the year 1900, the <b>Agonic</b> <b>line</b> passed roughly through Detroit and then was East of Florida. It currently passes roughly west of Chicago, IL, and through New Orleans, LA. If a navigator is located on the <b>agonic</b> <b>line,</b> then Variation is zero. Magnetic North Pole and the Geographic North Pole appear to be directly in line with each other, while the navigator is located on the <b>Agonic</b> <b>line.</b> If a navigator is East of the <b>agonic</b> <b>line,</b> then the {{variation is}} westward. Magnetic North appears slightly west of the Geographic North Pole. If a navigator is West of the <b>Agonic</b> <b>Line,</b> then the Variation is Eastward. The magnetic North Pole appears to the East of the geographic North Pole. The further the navigator is from the <b>agonic</b> <b>line,</b> the greater the variation. The local magnetic variation is indicated on NOAA Nautical Charts {{at the center of the}} compass rose. The Magnetic Variation is indicated along with the year of that Variation. The annual increase or decrease of the Variation is also usually indicated. So that the Variation for the current year can be calculated.|$|E

50|$|In {{the study}} of the Earth's {{magnetic}} field, the term isogon or isogonic line refers to a line of constant magnetic declination, the variation of magnetic north from geographic north. An <b>agonic</b> <b>line</b> is drawn through points of zero magnetic declination. An isoporic line refers to a line of constant annual variation of magnetic declination.|$|E

50|$|By convention, {{declination}} {{is positive}} when magnetic north is east of true north, and negative {{when it is}} to the west. Isogonic lines are lines on the Earth's surface along which the declination has the same constant value, and lines along which the declination is zero are called <b>agonic</b> <b>lines.</b> The lowercase Greek letter δ (delta) is frequently used as the symbol for magnetic declination.|$|R
50|$|Magnetic {{declination}} {{has been}} measured in many countries, including the U.S. The line of zero declination (the <b>agonic</b> <b>line)</b> in North America {{runs from the}} North Magnetic Pole through Lake Superior and southward into the Gulf of Mexico. Along this line, true north {{is the same as}} magnetic north. West of the line of zero declination, a compass will give a reading that is east of true north. Conversely, east of the line of zero declination, a compass reading will be west of true north.|$|E
40|$|The {{main part}} of the {{geomagnetic}} field – produced by a dynamo process in the Earth's outer core – changes its direction and strength in time, over timescales from months to centuries, even millennia. Its temporal variations, known as secular variation and secular acceleration, are crucial ingredients for understanding the physics of the deep Earth. Very long series of measurements therefore play an important role. Here, we provide an updated series of geomagnetic declination in Paris, shortly after a very special occasion: its value has reached zero after some 350  years of westerly values. Indeed, during October and November  2013, the declination at the Chambon la Forêt geomagnetic observatory changed from westerly to easterly values, the <b>agonic</b> <b>line</b> then passing through this place. We take this occasion to emphasize the importance of long series of continuous measurements...|$|E
40|$|Using the spherical {{harmonic}} coefficients {{defining the}} International Geomagnetic Reference Field Models for the 21 epochs 1900 to 2000, the geographic {{locations of the}} dip equator in different longitudes were computed. It is shown that the migratory trends in the dip equator are widely different in the American, African and Indian sectors. The largest change is seen over 30 °W to 40 °W while there is practically no secular movement over 100 years in the 30 °E longitude. It is seen that the geographic longitude of the dip equator farthest away from the geographic equator in the American sector shows a westward migration {{at the rate of}} ~ 0. 2 °/year which compares favorably with the average westward drift of the non-dipolar field discussed in the literature. The distance between the magnetic center of the eccentric dipole and the Earth’s center, the South Atlantic Geomagnetic Anomaly (SAGA) center and the migration of the local minimum of the dip equatorial longitude in the American center are all linearly related. In addition, the westward drift in the <b>agonic</b> <b>line</b> over the geographic equator in the American sector, indicative of the contributions from non-dipolar terms, is also linearly related to the three parameters. As the observed location of the dip equator in the American sector closely matches the model-based one, it is suggested that identification of the geographic longitude of the dip equator in the American zone based on a survey over a small area can provide useful information on several other parameters of the westward drift of the geomagnetic field...|$|E
30|$|Forecasting of {{magnetic}} field {{change has been}} attempted in many forms over the past 300 years since Halley’s observation of westward motion of the <b>agonic</b> <b>line</b> in the Atlantic hemisphere (Halley, 1692). Currently, a widely used forecast of the average secular variation (SV) is produced for the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model every five years. The IGRF models are an agreed set of field coefficients representing snapshots of the magnetic field at defined times {{and a set of}} coefficients forecasting the average SV for a period of five years into the future. The tenth generation of the International Geomagnetic Reference Field model (IGRF- 10) covered the period from 2005.0 to 2010.0 (Macmillan and Maus, 2005). For the IGRF- 10 SV model, the methods to estimate the average SV over its five year lifetime used a combination of polynomial extrapolation of satellite data and linear prediction filters applied to observatory data. However, these approaches do not invoke any particular physical arguments to support the assumption that the field coefficients will continue to change linearly (which, of course, they do not). Lowes (2000) succinctly outlines the issues faced in forecasting of SV, noting that an understanding of the fluid processes within the core might be useful in producing more accurate predictions. Since 2005, a number of forecasting techniques have been developed to incorporate physical approximations. For example, Sun et al. (2007) and Fournier et al. (2007) both outline frameworks in which observed magnetic field data can be assimilated into physical magnetohydrodynamic models. More recently, Kuang et al. (2009) have assimilated historical field data into numerical dynamo models to investigate if improvements can be made to forecast field models.|$|E
