Legal strategies to encourage this form of biosequestration include permanent protection of forests in National Parks or on the World Heritage List, properly funded management and bans on use of rainforest timbers and inefficient uses such as woodchipping old growth forest.|$|E

25|$|The AMA {{has also}} {{supported}} changes in medical malpractice law to limit damage awards, which, it contends, {{makes it difficult}} for patients to find appropriate medical care. In many states, high risk specialists have moved to other states that have enacted reform. For example, in 2004, all neurosurgeons had relocated out of the entire southern half of Illinois. The main legislative emphasis in multiple states has been to effect caps on the amount that patients can receive for pain and suffering. These costs for pain and suffering are only those that exceed the actual costs of healthcare and lost income. At the same time however, states without caps also experienced similar results; suggesting that other market factors {{may have contributed to the}} decreases. Some economic studies have found that caps have historically had an uncertain effect on premium rates. Nevertheless, the AMA believes the caps may alleviate what is often perceived as an excessively litigious environment for many doctors. <b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>report</b> <b>by</b> the AMA found that in a 12-month period, five percent of physicians had claims filed against them.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{international}} {{agencies and the}} UN have reported human rights violations in Indian-administered Kashmir. In a 2008 press release the OHCHR spokesmen stated [...] "The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights {{is concerned about the}} recent violent protests in Indian-administered Kashmir that have reportedly led to civilian casualties as well as restrictions to the right to freedom of assembly and expression." [...] A 1996 Human Rights Watch report accuses the Indian military and Indian-government backed paramilitaries of [...] "committ serious and widespread human rights violations in Kashmir." [...] Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society labels the happenings in Kashmir as war crimes and genocide and have issued a statement that those responsible should be tried in court of law. Some of the massacres by security forces include Gawakadal massacre, Zakoora and Tengpora massacre and Handwara massacre. Another such alleged massacre occurred on 6 January 1993 in the town of Sopore. TIME Magazine described the incident as such: [...] "In retaliation for the killing of one soldier, paramilitary forces rampaged through Sopore's market, setting buildings ablaze and shooting bystanders. The Indian government pronounced the event 'unfortunate' and claimed that an ammunition dump had been hit by gunfire, setting off fires that killed most of the victims." [...] A state government inquiry into the 22October 1993 Bijbehara killings, in which the Indian military fired on a procession and killed 40 people and injured 150, found out that the firing by the forces was 'unprovoked' and the claim of the military that it was in retaliation was 'concocted and baseless'. However, the accused are still to be punished. In its report of September 2006, Human Rights Watch stated: Many human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW) have condemned human rights abuses in Kashmir by Indians such as [...] "extra-judicial executions", [...] "disappearances", and torture. The [...] "Armed Forces Special Powers Act" [...] grants the military, wide powers of arrest, the right to shoot to kill, and to occupy or destroy property in counterinsurgency operations. Indian officials claim that troops need such powers because the army is only deployed when national security is at serious risk from armed combatants. Such circumstances, they say, call for extraordinary measures. Human rights organisations have also asked the Indian government to repeal the Public Safety Act, since [...] "a detainee may be held in administrative detention for a maximum of two years without a court order." [...] A 2008 report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees determined that Indian Administered Kashmir was only 'partly free'. <b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>report</b> <b>by</b> Amnesty International stated that up to 20,000 people have been detained under a law called AFSPA in Indian-administered Kashmir.|$|E
