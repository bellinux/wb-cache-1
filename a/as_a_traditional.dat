5|$|The {{series has}} been {{described}} as a hybrid of fantasy and procedural dramas and serials, influenced by film and television shows such as Lost, The X-Files, Altered States, and The Twilight Zone. The series began <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> mystery-of-the-week series and became more serialized in later seasons. Most episodes contain a standalone plot, with several others also exploring the series' overarching mythology.|$|E
5|$|Traditional dishes include laverbread (made from laver (Porphyra umbilicalis), an edible seaweed); bara brith (fruit bread); cawl (a lamb stew); cawl cennin (leek soup); Welsh cakes; and Welsh lamb.

5|$|A common snack in Africa is Koki or Moyin-Moyin, {{where the}} cowpeas are mashed into a paste and then wrapped in banana leaves. They {{also use the}} cowpea paste as a {{supplement}} in infant formula when weaning babies off milk. Slaves brought to America and the West Indies cooked cowpeas {{much the same way}} as they did in Africa, although many people in the American South considered cowpeas not suitable for human consumption. A popular dish was Hoppin' John, which contained black-eyed peas cooked with rice and seasoned with pork. Over time cowpeas became more universally accepted and now Hoppin' John is seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> Southern dish ritually served on New Year's Day.|$|E

5|$|Holroyd joined League One club Preston North End for an {{undisclosed}} fee on 20 January 2012. The move meant that Holroyd was again playing under the management of Graham Westley, who had signed him on loan during his time at Stevenage. He made his debut a day later playing in a new position on the right wing and winning {{the man of the}} match award in a 2–0 home defeat to Leyton Orient. Holroyd scored his first goal for Preston on 21 April 2012, heading in a Danny Mayor cross at the back post in a 1–1 draw away at Oldham Athletic. In total, Holroyd made 20 appearances for Preston, where he was played mostly <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> right winger.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, {{rumors of}} Dominator being {{relocated}} to Kings Dominion surfaced. On September 21, 2007, Cedar Fair announced that Geauga Lake {{would no longer}} operate <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> amusement park, and instead become solely a waterpark, Wildwater Kingdom. As a result, September 16, 2007 was the last day the ride would operate at Geauga Lake. With that announcement, the rides from the amusement park side began to be relocated to other Cedar Fair properties. The new location of Dominator, however, was not released.|$|E
5|$|Mansaf is a {{very popular}} dish that is usually served during {{important}} events, such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> wedding, engagement, funeral, baptism and circumcision. It is a dish incorporating {{all the elements of}} Palestinian land, such as bread, laban (yogurt) soup, rice, nuts (pine nuts), parsley and lamb, making it an important cultural dish. The meal is oftentimes served the traditional way in a large common plate, a sidr. The meal is usually eaten without the use of tableware, but rather each person sits beside each other eating from the same large plate.|$|E

5|$|The Empire of Japan endeavored, through {{education}} initiatives and specific {{financial support for}} new shrines, to frame Shinto practice as a patriotic moral tradition. From the early Meiji era, the divine origin of the Emperor was the official position of the state, and taught in classrooms not as myth, but as historical fact. Shinto priests were hired to teach in public schools, and cultivated this teaching, alongside reverence for the Emperor and compulsory class trips to shrines. State Shinto practitioners also emphasized the ritual aspect <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> civic practice that did not explicitly call on faith to participate.|$|E
5|$|The Johns Hopkins–Maryland rivalry is an intercollegiate sports {{rivalry between}} the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays, which {{represent}} Johns Hopkins University, and the Maryland Terrapins, which represent the University of Maryland. The most prominent event {{has been the}} men's lacrosse series, which {{is widely regarded as}} the greatest rivalry in the sport. More than 100 contests in the series have been played since the schools first met in 1895. The competition is intensified by each program's status <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> lacrosse powerhouse. As such, the game has often held national championship implications, and twice the teams played to represent the United States in the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The main {{advantage}} of composite bows over self bows (made {{from a single}} piece of wood) is their combination of smaller size with high power. They are therefore more convenient than self bows when the archer is mobile, as from horseback, or from a chariot. Almost all composite bows are also recurve bows as the shape curves away from the archer; this design gives higher draw-weight {{in the early stages of}} the archer's draw, storing somewhat more total energy for a given final draw-weight. It would be possible to make a wooden bow that has the same shape, length and draw-weight <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> composite bow, but it could not store the energy, and would break before full draw.|$|E

5|$|Volunteers {{from the}} rural villages formed {{the bulk of the}} rebels' {{fighting}} force and {{during the course of the}} revolt, each village typically contained a 30-man reserve unit. However, Hananu's forces also included volunteers from Aleppo city, former Ottoman conscripts, Bedouin tribesmen (including some 1,500 Mawali fighters) and Turkish officers who served as advisers. The ′iṣābāt were rooted in the rural countryside, but also drew financial support from people in the cities. While the rebels functioned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> rural Syrian autonomous movement wary of centralized authority or foreign intervention into their affairs, they also sought to establish close ties with the Arab nationalist movement and, until the Arab Army's defeat at Maysalun, with representatives of the Arab government based in the cities.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} 21½ total {{hours on the}} lunar surface, they had left behind {{scientific}} instruments that included a retroreflector array used for the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment and a Passive Seismic Experiment Package used to measure moonquakes. They also left an Apollo 1 mission patch, and a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> symbol of peace and a silicon message disk. The disk carries the goodwill statements by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disc also carries a listing of {{the leadership of the}} US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management. (In his 1989 book, Men from Earth, Aldrin says that the items included Soviet medals commemorating Cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin.) Also, according to Deke Slayton's book Moonshot, Armstrong carried with him a special diamond-studded astronaut pin from Slayton.|$|E
5|$|British {{policy-makers}} regarded Portugal <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> friend—the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance dated back to 1386, {{and both}} countries {{were in the}} North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the European Free Trade Association—but the combined strength of the communist bloc and the Afro-Asian lobby in the United Nations forced the British to peel back {{their support for the}} pluricontinental Estado Novo ("New State") during the early 1960s. Portugal's Colonial War, starting in Angola in 1961, pitted it against a number of guerrilla factions in its African territories, most of which subscribed to communist political thinking. Britain opposed communist encroachment into southern Africa, but knew it would become an international pariah if it publicly opposed general consensus at the UN, which roundly condemned colonialism in all forms and supported communist-backed insurgencies across the region, regarding them as racial liberation movements. It therefore attempted an awkward balancing act whereby it would appear to oppose Portugal without meaningfully doing so.|$|E

5|$|Joseph's {{reforms were}} deeply unpopular within the Austrian Netherlands. The Enlightenment had made few inroads into the territory, {{and it was}} widely distrusted as a foreign {{phenomenon}} which was not compatible with traditional local values. The majority of the population, especially influenced by the Church, believed the reforms {{to be a threat}} to their own cultures and traditions which would leave them worse off. Even in pro-Enlightenment circles, the reforms caused discontent which were seen as not sufficiently radical and not far reaching enough. Popular opposition was centered on the provincial states, in particular Hainaut, Brabant and Flanders, as well as their law courts. There was a wave of critical pamphleting. In some towns, riots broke out and the militia had to be called to suppress them. The Estate of Brabant called a lawyer, Hendrik Van der Noot, to defend their position publicly. Van der Noot publicly accused the reforms of violating the precedents established by the Joyous Entry of 1356 which was widely regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> bill of rights for the region.|$|E
5|$|Taapsee {{played a}} short role in her next release Mr. Perfect (2011). In it, she acted {{alongside}} Prabhas and Kajal Aggarwal {{and the film}} was a moderate success. She starred in a high budget film titled Veera (2011), opposite Ravi Teja and Kajal Aggarwal, which received moderate reviews. She was next seen in her second Tamil film Vandhaan Vendraan, that fetched mixed reviews and did not fare well at the box office. Her next film was Krishna Vamsi's Mogudu where she acted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> Telugu girl opposite Gopichand and garnered critical acclaim for her performance. She worked on the Tamil–Telugu bilingual Gundello Godari—titled Maranthen Mannithen in Tamil— apart from Daruvu and Shadow. She also made her Bollywood debut through Chashme Baddoor where she shares the screen with Siddharth, Rishi Kapoor, Divyendu Sharma and Ali Zafar. The film is a remake of the 1981 film with the same title. Taapsee was also approached to dub the voice of Hollywood actress Katee Sackhoff in the Tamil, Telugu and Hindi versions of the science fiction film Riddick, but declined the offer due to her prior commitments. In later 2013, she {{was seen in the}} big budget action thriller Arrambam co-starring Ajith Kumar and Arya. She was awarded Most Enthusiastic Performer–Female Award at the 2014 Edison Awards for her performance in the film.|$|E
5|$|The FA Charity Shield {{was founded}} in 1908 as a {{successor}} to the Sheriff of London Charity Shield, and began as a contest between the respective champions of the Football League and Southern League, although in 1913 it was played between an Amateurs XI and a Professionals XI. In 1921, it was played by the league champions of the Football League First Division and the FA Cup winners for the first time. The 1974 match was the first Charity Shield game to be played at Wembley Stadium as the Football Association (the FA) tried to revive {{the status of the}} match <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> season curtain-raiser by moving it to the country's showpiece venue. Furthermore, it was televised live {{for the first time ever}} and the FA insisted on the champions and cup winners both taking part for the first time since 1970.|$|E

5|$|The game's success, {{which went}} against what Square Enix assumed would happen {{due to the}} title's {{identity}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> role-playing game, prompted them to reconsider their strategy for game making, which {{up to that point}} had been geared towards developing titles tailored for western markets rather than focusing on the Japanese market. According to the developers, none of them believed that the game would be released overseas, and were overwhelmed by the positive fan feedback they had received. A manga titled Bravely Default: Flying Fairy began serialization online through Famitsu. Two compilation volumes were released in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Two supplementary books, released under the title Bravely Default: The Pocketbook of R, were released in December 2013. In addition to this, two drama CDs containing supplementary stories were released through 2013 and 2014. Music from the game was featured Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as DLC.|$|E
5|$|White's kicking {{accuracy}} was {{of particular}} note for a ruckman—his goal-kicking accuracy finished at {{slightly less than}} 60%. He was a consistent exponent of the spectacular mark, preferring to take chest marks high over packs. He was nominated on several occasions for the Mark of the Year, but he never won the award. His ball-skills and work around the ground remained one of his greatest strengths throughout his career. He effected 5000 hit-outs in his AFL career, the most by any one player since records began in 1987, with a career-high game total of 47 during a resounding round-22 win over West Coast Eagles in 2000. Testament to his durability and consistency, he was {{ranked in the top}} five in the AFL in total number of hit-outs for nine consecutive seasons from 1999. At 195cm, White is relatively short for a ruckman, and operated more as a ruck-rover than <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> ruckman. He was noted for his athleticism and vertical-leap, which helped him overcome his lack of height in comparison to other ruckmen. His approach to ruck-work—with greater emphasis on possessing the ball and working around the ground—helped him adapt to the changed centre-circle rules, and compensated for his lack of height and diminished ability at stoppages. Following the departure of Jim Stynes from Melbourne, White later worked on his game with former ruckman Sam Newman. Percy Johnson, Stynes and finally Newman guided and influenced White's ruck-work during his career.|$|E
