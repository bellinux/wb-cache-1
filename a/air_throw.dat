40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{simulation}} {{technique was}} used to study the effect of air distribution and supply parameters on ventilation performance and comfort of occupants in a government office building in Ottawa, Canada. The floor studied had two separate ceiling-based air supply systems, a slot system and a nozzle system with personal environmental control capability. In situ measurements were used to validate {{the results of the}} CFD simulation. Good agreements between the measured and predicted data were observed. The range of system configuration and parameters investigated include: (1) seasonal operating conditions (spring vs. summer); (2) supply airflow rate; (3) supply room temperature; (4) <b>air</b> <b>throw</b> orientation; and (5) diffuser location. Indoor air temperature, air velocity, mean age of air, Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), and Air Change Effectiveness (ACE) were estimated to investigate the performance of the ventilation system during occupancy...|$|E
40|$|How {{to model}} airflow {{discharged}} from diffuser {{is believed to}} be one of the key issues in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications to indoor air problem. Due to the complicated geometric feature and the vortex-type airflow induced by swirl diffuser, simulating such a kind of diffuser is claimed to be a challenge. A simplified method of defining the boundary conditions at round swirl inlets is developed and introduced in this paper. With this method a round diffuser was divided into 6 triangular sectors with equal air discharge rate, while various <b>air</b> <b>throw</b> orientation angle was assigned to each sector. CFD simulations were performed based on thermal and airflow boundary conditions recorded in a controlled environment chamber, which was equipped with both ceiling and floor mounted round diffusers. Comparisons between smoke airflow visualization and CFD predictions demonstrated the effectiveness of the current simplified modeling method of swirl diffuser. On top of this, profiles of temperature, air velocity, and CO 2 concentration from measurements were also presented to validate the CFD simulation results...|$|E

50|$|Karamzin is well-regarded as a historian. Until the {{appearance}} of his work, little had been done in this direction in Russia. The preceding attempt of Vasily Tatishchev was merely a rough sketch, inelegant in style, and without the true spirit of criticism. Karamzin was most industrious in accumulating materials, and the notes to his volumes are mines of interesting information. Perhaps Karamzin may justly be criticized for the false gloss and romantic <b>air</b> <b>thrown</b> over the early Russian annals; in this respect his work is reminiscent of that of Sir Walter Scott, whose writings were at that time creating a great sensation throughout Europe and probably influenced Karamzin.|$|R

5|$|Florida State {{began work}} at its 30-yard line, again needing to just {{run down the}} clock to ensure victory.

Florida State again went three-and-out and had to punt. Two {{and a half minutes}} had been run off the clock, and Virginia Tech took over at its own 30-yard line after a seven-yard kick return. Unlike the two {{previous}} drives, however, Virginia Tech had almost no success on offense. A 10-yard holding penalty pushed the Hokie offense back to start the drive, and quarterback Marcus Vick was sacked for a loss to finish off the Tech possession. VT was forced to punt the ball back to Florida State, which took over at its 43-yard line with 6:21 remaining.|$|R
50|$|King is a {{character}} that has more of a defensive approach rather than a full blown offensive one, despite popular belief. King has to be played carefully since he has a limited range and is very unsafe. King relies on quick strikes, good movement, {{and a very good}} view on punishment. In game he is known for his speed and has an arsenal of over 200 moves in his command list. Being a professional wrestler with lucha libre influences, King has many powerful throws at his disposal, and has a lot of strong counterattacks. King is notable for his chains throws, which he's had since Tekken 2, when {{he was one of the}} very few characters to have them. He also utilizes duck throws, ground <b>throws</b> and <b>air</b> <b>throws,</b> uncommon for characters in the Tekken series.|$|R
