40|$|Moisture {{damage in}} asphalt {{mixtures}} {{is a complicated}} mode of pavement distress that results {{in the loss of}} stiffness and structural strength of the asphalt pavement layers. This paper evaluated the moisture sensitivity of different aggregate–bitumen combinations through three different approaches: surface energy, peel adhesion and the Saturation Ageing Tensile Stiffness (SATS) tests. In addition, the results obtained from these three tests were compared so as to characterise the relationship between the thermodynamic and the mechanical tests. The surface energy tests showed that the work of <b>adhesion</b> <b>in</b> <b>dry</b> <b>conditions</b> was bitumen type dependent, which is in agreement with the peel test. After moisture damage, all of these three tests found that the moisture sensitivity of aggregate–bitumen combinations were mainly aggregate type dependent. Based on the peel test, the moisture absorption and mineralogical compositions of aggregate were considered as two important factors to moisture sensitivity. This phenomenon suggests that in a susceptible asphalt mixture, the effect of aggregate may be more influential than the effect of bitumen. The SATS test and the peel test showed similar moisture sensitivity results demonstrating the good correlation between these two mechanical tests. However, the surface energy tests and the mechanical tests cannot correlate in terms of moisture sensitivity evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Diamond {{has been}} under {{spotlight}} in industry since the discovery of its extraordinary mechanical properties, high wear resistance and excellent chemical inertia. These properties enable diamond a competitive candidate for industrial and biomedical applications. In the present research, the tribological properties of two types of diamond materials, diamond reinforced ceramic composites and diamond coatings have been investigated. Experimental approaches consist of tribological investigation, electrochemical evaluation and characterization of diamond-reinforced ceramic composites (DRCC), thin nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) film, thin microcrystalline diamond (MCD) film and their functionalized derivatives. After the tribotest, phase transformation from diamond carbon (sp^(3)) to amorphous carbon (sp^(2)) is confirmed by Raman spectroscopy in the diamond composite. The surface roughness of the diamond grits {{was found to be}} greatly reduced due to wear. A tribo-electrochemical method is developed to in situ monitor the this amorphrization-wear process. It is discovered that the current density {{is a function of the}} excitation voltage in a sinusoidal pattern. The amplitude and period of the sinusoidal pattern reflect the intensity and the frequency of the process. For the diamond-cartilage contact, it is found that the coefficient of friction between cartilage Figure and diamond decreases with increasing load because real contact area is not linearly change with load. Even though the hydrogen treatment decreases the friction and ammonia treatment decreases <b>adhesion</b> and friction <b>in</b> <b>dry</b> <b>conditions,</b> the friction under lubrication is determined by synergy effects of number of bonds established and strength of single bond between protein of the cartilage and the diamond surface. In the present research, the wear mechanism of diamond-reinforced composite has been demonstrated. The amorphization-wear process of diamond can be real-timely monitored using electrochemical approach. The frication force between diamond surface and human cartilage can be adjusted by changing number of bonds established or strength of single bond between protein of the cartilage and the diamond surface. This research proposes new avenue in the evaluation of friction and wear of diamond materials, which will be beneficial to wide range of diamond applications, including aerospace industries, mechanical processing, biomedical science, prosthetics and energy industries...|$|R
40|$|To {{attract more}} {{customers}} and {{compete with other}} modes of transportation, railway transport needs to ensure safety, punctuality, high comfort, and low cost; wheel–rail adhesion, i. e., the transmitted tangential force in the longitudinal direction during driving and braking, {{plays an important role}} in all these aspects. Adhesion needs to be kept at a certain level for railway operation and maintenance. However, wheel−rail contact is an open system contact. Different contaminants can present between the wheel and rail surfaces, forming a third-body layer that affects the adhesion. Prediction of wheel–rail adhesion is important for railway operations and research into vehicle dynamics; however, this prediction is difficult because of the presence of contaminants. This thesis deals with wheel–rail adhesion from a tribological perspective. The five appended papers discuss wheel–rail <b>adhesion</b> <b>in</b> terms of <b>dry</b> <b>conditions,</b> lubricated conditions, leaf contamination, iron oxides, and environmental conditions. The research methodologies used are numerical modelling, scaled laboratory experiments, and field tests. The research objective is to understand the mechanisms of the adhesion loss phenomenon.   A numerical model was developed to predict wheel–rail adhesion based on real measured 3 D surfaces. Computer simulation indicates that surface topography has a larger impact on lubricated than on dry contacts. Plastic deformation in asperities is found to be very important in the model. Ball-on-disc tests indicate that water can give an extremely low adhesion coefficient on smooth surfaces, possibly due to surface oxidation. Investigation of lubricated contacts at low speed indicates that oil reduces the adhesion coefficient by carrying a normal load, while adhesion loss due to water depends on the surface topography, water temperature, and surface oxidation. A field investigation indicates that leaves reduce the friction coefficient because of the chemical reaction between leaves and bulk materials. The thickness of the surface oxide layer was found to be an essential factor determining adhesion reduction. Pin-on-disc experiments found a transition in the friction coefficient with regard to the relative humidity, due to a trade-off between the water molecule film and the hematite on the surface.   QC 20131031 </p...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: The bonding {{mechanisms}} of self etching primers, {{based upon the}} simultaneous etching and priming of dentin, simplifies the bonding technique, but the efficiency of these systems is still controversial. This study compared the shear bond strength of three self etch adhesive systems <b>in</b> <b>dry</b> and wet <b>conditions.</b> Materials and Method: In this experimental study, 77 intact bovine lower incisors with flat 600 grit sanded enamel surface were fixed in acrylic molds and divided into 7 groups, of 11 teeth. The enamel surfaces were treated according to a special procedure as follows: Group 1 : Prompt L-Pop (PLP) <b>in</b> <b>dry</b> <b>condition,</b> Group 2 : Prompt L-Pop in wet condition, Group 3 : Clearfield SE Bond (CSEB) <b>in</b> <b>dry</b> <b>condition,</b> Group 4 : Clearfield SE Bond in wet condition, Group 5 : iBond (iB) <b>in</b> <b>dry</b> <b>condition,</b> Group 6 : iBond in wet condition, Group 7 : Margin Bond (Control) <b>in</b> <b>dry</b> <b>condition.</b> Surfaces were air dried for ten seconds, or blot <b>dried</b> <b>in</b> wet <b>condition.</b> Composite resin was bonded on the enamel and built up by applying a cylindric teflon split mold (4 mm height 2 mm diameter). After 24 hours storage in dionized water at room temperature, all specimens were thermocycled and shear bond test was employed by a universal testing machine (Instron) with a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min. The shear bond strength was recorded in MPa and data were analyzed with ANOVA and Scheffe statistical tests. P< 0. 05 was considered as statistically significant. The mode of failure was examined under a stereomicroscope. Results: 1 - Shear bond strength of CSEB <b>in</b> <b>dry</b> <b>condition</b> (21. 5 ± 4. 8 MPa) {{was significantly higher than}} PLP and iB groups (p< 0. 0001). 2 - Shear bond strength of iB and PLP groups <b>in</b> <b>dry</b> <b>condition</b> (9. 60 ± 2. 2, 9. 49 ± 3 MPa) were significantly lower than CSEB and control (2. 99 ± 5. 1 MPa) (P< 0. 0001). 3 - There {{was no significant difference between}} PLP and iB groups <b>in</b> <b>dry</b> <b>condition</b> (P= 1). 4 - Shear bond strength of CSEB in wet condition (21. 8 ± 3 MPa) was significantly higher than PLP and iB groups (P= 0. 0). 5 - Shear bond strength of CSEB (10. 8 ± 3 MPa) and PLP (10. 6 ± 4 MPa) in wet condition were significantly lower than CSEB and Control groups (P= 0. 0). 6 - There was no significant difference between PLP and iB groups in wet condition (P= 0. 99). 7 - Shear bond strength of the three adhesives had no significant difference <b>in</b> <b>dry</b> and wet <b>conditions</b> (PLP: P= 0. 53, CSEB: P= 0. 84, iB: P= 0. 53). The mode of failure in two groups of PLP and two groups of iB was predominantly in the adhesive bond and in the two groups of CSEB, mixed failure (adhesive with cohesive in composite) was predominantly observed. Conclusion: CSEB had higher while iB and PLP showed lower bond strength to ground enamel. The three self-etch adhesives in this study did not show technique sensitivity to wet and dry enamel...|$|R
