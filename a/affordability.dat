5|$|After World War II, and the {{building}} of the Interstate Highway System beginning in 1956, automobile ownership and travel became a preferred mode of travel in the United States. This, combined with the increasing <b>affordability</b> of air travel, spelled trouble for Greyhound and other intercity bus carriers.|$|E
5|$|London {{is among}} {{the best places to}} retire in Ontario, {{according}} to Comfort Life, a publication for seniors because of safety, <b>affordability</b> and the short distance to nearby beaches such as Port Stanley, Port Burwell and Lambton Shores.|$|E
5|$|Production {{ended in}} 1967 {{soon after the}} Rootes Group {{was taken over by}} Chrysler, which did not have a {{suitable}} engine to replace the Ford V8. Owing to the ease and <b>affordability</b> of modifying the Tiger, there are few surviving cars in standard form.|$|E
5|$|The College of Business {{is named}} one of the best {{business}} schools according to The Princeton Review for the fifth year in a row. The College of Business is also named by GetEducated.com as the third best buy for <b>affordability</b> and quality in the Online Masters of Business Administration (AACSB-accredited) category.|$|E
5|$|Issues {{that affect}} water {{supply in the}} United States include {{droughts}} in the West, water scarcity, pollution, a backlog of investment, concerns about the <b>affordability</b> of water for the poorest, and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall {{as a result of}} climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution from combined sewer overflows.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{slowdown}} of {{the economy}} {{at the end of}} the Depression, the country entered World War II, which renewed the importance of railroads. The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles, so Meridian became the region's rail center again. This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s, when the <b>affordability</b> of automobiles and the subsidized Interstate Highway System drew off passengers from the trains. The decline of the railroad industry, which went through considerable restructuring among freight lines as well, caused significant job losses. The city's population declined as workers left for other areas.|$|E
5|$|The GCV {{acquisition}} {{strategy was}} revised on 17 January 2013 to further reduce risk and maintain <b>affordability</b> of the program. The revision extended the technology development phase by {{six months to}} give industry more time to refine vehicle designs. Milestone B would occur in 2014, with {{the selection of a}} single vendor for the engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) and production phases of the program. This would initiate critical design and testing activities in anticipation of vehicle production. Budgetary pressures caused the reduction of number of vendors to be selected from two to one.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both accepted the Medicaid expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive health care services and less likely to incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills than before the expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug <b>affordability,</b> reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E
5|$|A liberal {{member of}} Congress, Tierney voted {{along with other}} Democratic Representatives from Massachusetts. He sat on the House Committee on Education and Labor, where his {{priorities}} included green energy and increased college access. He co-authored several pieces of legislation, including the Green Jobs Act of 2007 and the College <b>Affordability</b> and Accountability Act of 2008. He is {{the former chairman of}} the Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs, where he helped establish the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. From 1996 to 2012, Tierney comfortably won re-election in each cycle. He faced tougher challenges after his wife Patrice was convicted of felony tax fraud in 2010, narrowly defeating his Republican opponent in 2012. In the 2014 election, he lost the Democratic primary to Seth Moulton, who went on to hold the seat in the general election.|$|E
5|$|Minibuses are {{the most}} common type of public {{transportation}} in Mogadishu. The next most frequently used public vehicles in the city are auto rickshaws (bajaj). They number around 3,000 units and come in various designs. The auto rickshaws represent a lower cost alternative to taxis and minibuses, typically charging half the price for the same distance, with flexible rates. Due to their <b>affordability,</b> capacity to negotiate narrow lanes and low fuel consumption, the three-wheeled vehicles are often appealing investment opportunities for small-scale entrepreneurs. They are generally preferred for shorter commutes. In June 2013, two new taxi companies also started offering road transportation to residents. Part of a fleet of over 100 vehicles, Mogadishu Taxi's trademark yellow cabs offer rides throughout the city at flat rates of $5. City Taxi, the firm's nearest competitor, charges the same flat rate, with plans to add new cabs to its fleet.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s saw the {{increased}} use of audio cassettes and videotapes for the dissemination of bootleg recordings, as the <b>affordability</b> of private dubbing equipment made the production of multiple copies significantly easier. Cassettes were also smaller, easier to ship, and could be sold or traded more affordably than vinyl. Cassette culture and tape trading, propelled by the DIY ethic of the punk subculture, relied on an honour system where people who received tapes from fellow traders made multiple copies to pass on to others within the community. For a while, stalls at major music gatherings such as the Glastonbury Festival sold mass copies of bootleg soundboard recordings of bands who, in many cases, had played only a matter of hours beforehand. However, officials soon began to counteract this illegal activity by making raids on the stalls and, {{by the end of the}} 1980s, the number of festival bootlegs had consequently dwindled.|$|E
5|$|The statue {{depicts a}} doughboy walking through {{shattered}} tree stumps strung with barbed wire, his rifle {{in his left}} hand and his right hand held high above his head, clutching a hand grenade. The aggressive design and <b>affordability</b> of the statue made it extremely popular, and more than 150 copies of it were created for municipal memorials across the nation. The Smithsonian American Art Museum currently lists 159 locations. Of that number, 134 currently existing originals have been independently authenticated, and several have been identified as copies by other artists (notably Over the Top by John Paulding). Viquesney's actual brochures quoted a figure of over 300 by the late 1930s, claiming at least one in every state of the Union, but this is believed to be an inflated figure.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} economists, such as Macquarie Bank analyst Rory Robertson, assert that high {{immigration}} and the propensity of new arrivals to cluster {{in the capital}} cities is exacerbating the nation's housing <b>affordability</b> problem. According to Robertson, Federal Government policies that fuel demand for housing, such as the currently high levels of immigration, as well as capital gains tax discounts and subsidies to boost fertility, have had {{a greater impact on}} housing <b>affordability</b> than land release on urban fringes.|$|E

25|$|The current {{housing in}} the city region is {{inadequate}} to support the job growth. Current patterns of demand at {{the upper end of}} the market are likely to continue, increasing problems of division of social groups and <b>affordability.</b> At the other end of the market there are problems both with the shortage of social rented housing and <b>affordability.</b> There is a significant legacy of dense terraced housing some of which is no longer fit for purpose. The government has identified Leeds City Region to host a number of new eco-towns to meet housing demand.|$|E

25|$|<b>Affordability.</b> Urban water tariffs {{were highly}} {{affordable}} {{according to data}} from the year 2000. A family of five living on the poverty line which uses 20cubic meter of water per month would spend less than 1.2% of its budget on its water bill if it had a water meter. If it did not have a water meter and was charged a flat rate, it would pay 2.0% of its budget. This percentage lies below the often used <b>affordability</b> threshold of 5%. However, at that time the average metered tariff was estimated at only 0.03 per m3, or less than three times what it was estimated to be in 2007. Apparently no more up-to-date estimates on the share of the average water bill in the budget of the poor are available.|$|E
25|$|The early producers, enabled by the {{increasing}} <b>affordability</b> of sequencers and synthesizers, merged a European synthpop aesthetic with aspects of soul, funk, disco, and electro, pushing electronic dance music into uncharted terrain. They deliberately rejected the Motown legacy and traditional formulas of R and soul, and instead embraced technological experimentation.|$|E
