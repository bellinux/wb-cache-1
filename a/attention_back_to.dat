5|$|Leaders of AASEREA {{continued}} {{a campaign}} to unionize public transportation companies in American cities. The Indianapolis Street Railway Company, a smaller transportation company, did unionize in 1899 when its employees {{became part of the}} Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employees of America (AASEREA). After a series of successful AASEREA supported strikes, the latest in Cincinnati, Ohio during May 1913, the union leaders turned their <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|As the {{reactors}} at Hanford came online, the Metallurgical Laboratory turned its <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> theoretical designs. The discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but {{the challenge was}} met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. Wigner was also intrigued {{by the possibility of}} doing away with much of the complexities of a reactor by having the uranium in solution or a slurry in heavy water. The Metallurgical Laboratory attempted to find a way of doing this.|$|E
5|$|The Whitestone Branch {{would have}} had to be rebuilt if it were leased to the subway, with {{railroad}} crossings removed and the single track doubled. The PSC located 14 places where crossings needed to be eliminated. However, by early 1917, there was barely enough money to build the subway to Flushing, let alone a link to Whitestone and Bayside. A lease agreement was announced on October 16, 1917, but the IRT withdrew from the agreement a month later, citing that it was inappropriate to enter such an agreement at that time. Thereafter, the PSC instead turned its <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Main Street subway extension.|$|E
50|$|Immacolata (Redgrave) is {{a peasant}} girl and {{mistress}} of the count, but when he turns his <b>attentions</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his wife he has Immacolata committed to a mental asylum. 'La Vacanza' is her one-month experimental leave from the institution. She is rejected by her family and subsequently finds new friends {{in the form of}} gypsies and an Englishman. But their happiness is blighted by criminal actions and a fight for freedom.|$|R
50|$|The Huns {{remained}} out of Roman {{sight for}} the next few years while they invaded the Sassanid Empire. They were defeated in Armenia by the Sassanids, abandoned their invasion, and turned their <b>attentions</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Europe. In 440, they reappeared in force on the borders of the Roman Empire, attacking the merchants at the market on the north bank of the Danube that had been established by the treaty.|$|R
50|$|In 1973 Cummins {{turned his}} <b>attentions</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> football, winning a second Munster title {{following}} a 5-12 to 1-15 victory over great rivals Kerry. The team later {{qualified for the}} All-Ireland final with Galway providing the opposition. Teenager Jimmy Barry-Murphy scored {{the first of his}} two goals after just two minutes to set the tone. Cork had a reasonably comfortable 3-17 to 2-13 victory and Cummins became only the tenth player in the history of Gaelic games to win senior All-Ireland medals in both hurling and football.|$|R
5|$|The major field {{operation}} of the fall was Hood's Franklin-Nashville Campaign, an invasion of Tennessee, which he undertook despite Beauregard's counsel that it made little operational or logistical sense. Hood did not treat Beauregard with the respect due to the department commander, communicating his plans reluctantly and making movements {{without regard to the}} consequences for his supply line, which Beauregard scrambled to maintain. While Hood traveled through Alabama and into Tennessee, Union Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman began his March to the Sea from Atlanta to Savannah, which focused Beauregard's <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Georgia. He was ineffective in stopping, or even delaying, Sherman's advance. He had inadequate local forces and was reluctant to strip defenses from other locations to concentrate them against Sherman. Furthermore, Sherman did an excellent job of deceiving the Confederates as to the intermediate and final targets of his march. Savannah fell on December 21 and Sherman's army began to march north into South Carolina in January. Also in late December, Beauregard found out that Hood's army had been severely damaged in its defeat at the Battle of Nashville; there were very few men in fighting condition who could oppose Sherman's advance.|$|E
25|$|The Presbyterian Church in Canada {{developed}} the confessional document Living Faith (1984) and retains it as a subordinate standard of the denomination. It is confessional in format, yet like the Westminster Confession, draws <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> original Bible text.|$|E
25|$|After 1950, Helene Deutsch {{began to}} say that she regretted being known {{primarily}} for her work with women’s psychology. At this time, Deutsch began to turn her <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> men’s psychology and narcissism in both sexes. Over time, she became increasingly devoted to the study of egoism and narcissism, thereby abandoning her lifelong study of feminism.|$|E
5000|$|In early 2000, <b>attention</b> turned <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the {{permanent}} way from Woody Bay - Haste Hill. A plan of major track renewals was formulated, to gradually upgrade the entire RLR permanent {{way to the}} modern standard seen on stage 3.|$|R
50|$|After the Fāṭimids, {{under the}} third caliph, al-Mansur Billah (946-953), had {{defeated}} the Khārijite rebellion of Abu Yazid, they began, under his son al-Mu‘izz, <b>to</b> turn their <b>attentions</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their ambition of establishing their caliphate throughout the Islamic world and overthrowing the Abbasids. Although the Fāṭimids were {{primarily concerned with}} Egypt and the Near East, there were nevertheless campaigns fought by General Jawhar as-Siqilli against the Berbers of Morocco and the Umayyads of Spain. At the same time, Fatimid raids on Italy enabled naval superiority in the Western Mediterranean to be affirmed, {{at the expense of}} Byzantium, even capturing Sicily for a period of time.|$|R
25|$|The {{institution}} of an interlocking convoy {{system on the}} American coast and in the Caribbean Sea in mid-1942 created an enormous drop in attacks in those areas. <b>Attention</b> shifted <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Atlantic convoys. Matters were serious, but not critical throughout much of 1942.|$|R
25|$|In 2009, {{after months}} of speculation, Creed reunited for a new album called Full Circle, and toured {{until the end of}} 2012. Another album was planned, but has since been shelved. The {{instrumental}} members turned their <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Alter Bridge and Tremonti formed his own band, while Scott Stapp joined Art of Anarchy. There are currently no plans for Creed to resume.|$|E
25|$|Her {{interpretation}} of Plato's Symposium in particular drew considerable attention. Under Nussbaum's consciousness of vulnerability, the re-entrance of Alcibiades {{at the end}} of the dialogue undermines Diotima's account of the ladder of love in its ascent to the non-physical realm of the forms. Alcibiades's presence deflects <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> physical beauty, sexual passions, and bodily limitations, hence highlighting human fragility.|$|E
25|$|The {{wedding was}} notable {{for being the}} first {{marriage}} between a Bonaparte {{and a member of}} a reigning house of Europe since 1859. As it was the first major event since the fall of the Second French Republic, the marriage was instrumental in bringing considerable <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the prospects of the Bonapartes among various members of the press, especially pertaining to the establishment of another possible government.|$|E
50|$|The {{marriage}} {{fails to}} last when Victor rediscovers {{his love for}} Nikki, ending the marriage in an annulment. Consumed with robbing Victor of all he's worth, Diane schemes up a plan with Victor's son Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) to fake a pregnancy. However, when Victor discovers the scheme is a sham, he throws Diane out of the ambulance. Diane turns her <b>attentions</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Jack for help, but {{after a night of}} passion, Jack refuses <b>to</b> let Diane <b>back</b> into his life in a romantic capacity. Determined to escape town, Diane purchases Kyle a fake passport to send him to Switzerland under the alias Timothy Bilton {{and with the help of}} Adam would escape town and join him there.|$|R
5|$|Renovation of Kenilworth Road was {{neglected}} for {{the next}} two decades—financial difficulties and the club's ambitions to build a new ground meant that regeneration was unaffordable, and would also prove unnecessary should relocation occur. However, following the rejection of several potential sites for a new ground, the club finally turned their <b>attentions</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the maintenance of Kenilworth Road. The first real modernisation of the ground came in 1973, with the first addition of seats at the stadium since the construction of the new Main Stand in 1922. The Bobbers Stand became all-seated, {{while the rest of the}} ground remained terracing. The new-look stand could only hold 1,539 seats, and as a result the capacity of the ground dropped to 22,601.|$|R
50|$|Taking a {{financial}} outlook in 2000, Filippo launched a design and import line using Balinese silver, pearls, shell and Javanese scarves under {{the brand name}} of Mr. Guy. Represented by Priorities, a Los Angeles showroom, the line was successful until it was discontinued in 2007, which turned Filippo's <b>attention</b> entirely <b>back</b> <b>to</b> fine art.|$|R
25|$|During {{the next}} thirty-five years, {{with a large}} fleet, Genseric looted the coasts of the Eastern and Western Empires. Vandal {{activity}} in the Mediterranean was so substantial that the sea's name in Old English was Wendelsæ (i. e. Sea of the Vandals). After Attila the Hun's death, however, the Romans could afford to turn their <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Vandals, who were in control {{of some of the}} richest lands of their former empire.|$|E
25|$|Coleridge also faced {{personal}} {{challenges in}} carrying out the scheme. He {{received a letter from}} Mary Evans which argued against the plan, and his feelings for her for a time swayed him against Pantisocracy. Learning that she had become engaged, Coleridge turned his <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Pantisocracy and Sara Fricker. Under pressure from Southey to act with regard to Sara (both because of the demands of Pantisocracy and also because she was being courted by other men), Coleridge married Sara in October 1795.|$|E
25|$|Kamber {{turned his}} <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{politics}} in 1992. He supported the U.S presidential candidacy of Sen. Tom Harkin. Although {{he did not}} become involved in a presidential campaign {{to the extent that}} he did in 1984, Kamber nevertheless played a big role in the 1992 election. In July of that year, he established a political action committee called Americans for Change. The group's goal was to raise $1 million to run attack ads against President George H. W. Bush.|$|E
40|$|In late 2008, the U. S. {{and much}} of the industrialized world entered a recession, {{resulting}} in significant job loss across the globe.

50|$|Palm Springs {{had been}} {{awaiting}} Haber's {{return to the}} club scene and in January 1994, he obliged them {{with the opening of}} Touche, a $1.3 million Moroccan-themed bar, nightclub and restaurant. More than 500 people showed up on opening night, including Andy Williams, George Hamilton, Connie Stevens, Jack Jones, Engelbert Humperdinck, Marc Lawrence and Jackie Mason. Despite an international plug from Runaway with the Rich and Famous (featuring Robin Leach), a pattern emerged at Touche: Haber was turning people away on weekends, but had no mid-week business. He eventually discovered that people's work and play habits had changed, and that there was also more enlightenment about alcohol and substance abuse through the media. Haber sold Touche in 1996 for $250,000 and returned his <b>attentions</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> The Ingleside Inn and Melvyn's, which were still thriving.|$|R
5000|$|While {{nursing a}} sick Jane with {{paracetamol}} at Netherfield Park, Amanda finally puts {{a stop to}} Bingley's advances on her. Claiming to be a lesbian, {{she is able to}} direct his amorous <b>attentions</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Jane. Darcy, however, argues with Amanda about her bringing Jane to Netherfield Park, while Caroline Bingley takes a dislike to Amanda, and continually tries to embarrass her. She insists that Amanda play the piano for them, but upon her revelation that she cannot play, Amanda instead sings Petula Clark's song [...] "Downtown", and receives great applause from Darcy and Bingley. When Caroline snidely tells Amanda that, while she will never get the riches she's looking for, she at least won't starve, Amanda, in retaliation, boasts of her income of 27,000 pounds a year, which is enormous by Georgian standards.|$|R
25|$|Husky Oil {{was born}} during the Depression {{through the efforts}} of Glenn Nielson, an Alberta farmer driven to {{bankruptcy}} when the bank called a loan on his farm. Nielson had moved to Cody, Wyoming, by the time he founded Husky as a refining operation. He turned his <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Canada after the second world war, and decided to set up a refinery at Lloydminster. Steel was scarce, so Husky dismantled a small Wyoming refinery constructed during the war to provide bunker fuel to the American Navy. It loaded the pieces onto 40 gondola cars and shipped them north by railway.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the failure}} of his Kerak sieges, Saladin {{temporarily}} turned his <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> another long-term project and resumed attacks on the territory of ʻIzz ad-Dīn (Masʻūd ibn Mawdūd ibn Zangi), around Mosul, which he had begun with some success in 1182. However, since then, Masʻūd had allied himself with the powerful governor of Azerbaijan and Jibal, who in 1185 began moving his troops across the Zagros Mountains, causing Saladin to hesitate in his attacks. The defenders of Mosul, when they became aware that help was on the way, increased their efforts, and Saladin subsequently fell ill, so in March 1186 a peace treaty was signed.|$|E
50|$|Tao shot to an {{unprecedented}} meteoric rise to fame following the release of David Tao. Unable {{to cope with the}} sudden media <b>attention,</b> he flew <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Los Angeles soon afterwards.|$|R
60|$|For {{a while a}} {{confused}} babblement arose from the ruins, and then the universal <b>attention</b> came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Graham, perched high among the scaffolding. He saw {{the faces of the}} people turned towards him, heard their shouts at his rescue. From the throat of the ways came the song of the revolt spreading like a breeze across that swaying sea of men.|$|R

25|$|By mid-1742, the War of the Austrian Succession {{had broken}} out in Europe. Principally fought by Prussia and Austria over {{possession}} of Silesia, the war soon engulfed {{most of the major}} powers of Europe, who joined two competing alliances. The scale of this new war dwarfed any of the fighting in the Americas, and drew Britain and Spain's <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> operations on the European continent. The return of Vernon's fleet in 1742 marked the end of major offensive operations in the War of Jenkins' Ear. France entered the war in 1744, emphasizing the European theatre and planning an ambitious invasion of Britain. While it ultimately failed, the threat persuaded British policymakers of the dangers of sending significant forces to the Americas which might be needed at home.|$|E
25|$|Following Marriott's {{successful}} acting {{debut in}} Oliver!, his family {{encouraged him to}} pursue an acting career. In 1961 he auditioned and was accepted {{as a student at}} the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London. Because his family were unable to afford the private school fees, it was mutually agreed the fees would be deducted from acting work the school found him. After Marriott's enrolment at the Italia Conti Academy, he quickly gained acting roles, working consistently in film, television and radio, often typecast as the energetic Cockney kid. Soon he lost interest in acting and turned his <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his first love, which was music. His parents were devastated and his decision to give up acting caused a family rift. As a result, he left the family home for a short period to stay with friends.|$|E
25|$|When the Romans {{breached}} {{the treaty}} in 440, Attila and Bleda attacked Castra Constantias, a Roman fortress and marketplace {{on the banks}} of the Danube. The Eastern Romans stopped delivery of the agreed tribute, and they broke other conditions of the Treaty of Margus. The Hunnic kings turned their <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Eastern Romans. Reports that the Bishop of Margus had crossed into Hun lands and desecrated royal graves further angered the Hun kings. War broke out between the two empires, and the Huns overcame a weak Roman army to raze the cities of Margus, Singidunum and Viminacium. Although a truce was signed in 441, two years later Constantinople again failed to deliver the tribute and war resumed. In the following campaign, Hun armies came alarmingly close to Constantinople, sacking Sardica, Arcadiopolis and Philippopolis along the way. Suffering a complete defeat at the Battle of Chersonesus, the Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II gave in to Hun demands and in autumn 443 signed the Peace of Anatolius with the two Hun kings. The Huns returned to their lands with a vast train full of plunder.|$|E
50|$|Bored {{of working}} in the cafe, Kelly targets the rich men {{in the village and}} seduces curate, Ethan Blake, but they are caught by Laurel Thomas (Charlotte Bellamy) in the church. She then seduces Jimmy King (Nick Miles) and they have a brief fling but he ends their {{relationship}} when his ex-wife Sadie (Patsy Kensit), reveals Kelly's career as a glamour model. Kelly moves on to Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower) despite a thirty-one year age gap. Kelly develops feelings for Rodney and is delighted when he buys Holdgate Farm for her and his son, Paul Lambert (Mathew Bose), planning {{to turn it into a}} spa but Rodney runs out of money and the spa is abandoned. Despite promising to stand by Rodney, she turns her <b>attentions</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Scott. When caught by Rodney and Scott's current girlfriend, Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb), they split up. Kelly spends months feeling sorry for herself and takes her frustration out on her family.|$|R
5000|$|In December 1996, it was {{reported}} that the Korean investors were considering situating the satellite city at Blackwater, 85 kilometres west of Duaringa, because Blackwater already had many facilities in place. [...] However, <b>attention</b> shifted <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Duaringa when the original $30 million proposal was upgraded by the investors to a new $230 million investment. Copies of the new plans were sent to Duaringa Shire Council and the Department of Tourism, Small Business and Industry.|$|R
30|$|I {{will not}} discuss the presuppositions of {{temporal}} adpositions (e.g. before), which have received some <b>attention,</b> going <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Frege (1892 : 42, footnote**). For work on temporal adpositions (or on adpositions {{which can be used}} in a temporal sense), see e.g. Gründer (2008), König (1974), and Onea (2011). As noted in Macagno and Capone (2015), the preposition of can mean ‘before’ or ‘after’; in such situations it would presumably trigger the same presuppositions as before or after.|$|R
