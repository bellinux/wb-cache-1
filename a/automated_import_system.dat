40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the presence of both mitochondria and chloroplasts in plant cells there is a higher sorting requirement in a plant cell than that in a non-plant cell. Reflecting this, protein import to mitochondria and chloroplasts {{has been shown to be}} highly specific. However, there is a group of proteins which are encoded by a single gene in the nucleus, translated in the cytosol and targeted to both mitochondria and chloroplasts. These proteins are referred to as dual targeted proteins. The first protein shown to be dual targeted was pea glutathione reductase (GR). The focus of this thesis is the targeting properties of the dual targeted protein glutathione reductase. In order to overcome the limitations with traditional in vitro <b>import</b> <b>systems</b> we have developed an <b>import</b> <b>system</b> for simultaneous <b>import</b> of precursor proteins into mitochondria and chloroplasts (dual <b>import</b> <b>system).</b> The chloroplastic precursor of the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (SSU) was mis-targeted to pea mitochondria in a single <b>import</b> <b>system,</b> but was <b>imported</b> only into chloroplasts in the dual system. The dual GR reductase precursor was targeted to both mitochondria and chloroplasts in both the single and dual <b>import</b> <b>system.</b> We have investigated the targeting and processing properties of the GR targeting signal. Using N-terminal truncations we have demonstrated that the GR targeting signal has a domain organisation. Our results show that GR has evolved a dual targeting signal with the C-terminal part being sufficient for chloroplast import, the internal part required for the mitochondrial import and the N-terminal part housing a “fine-tuning” function. Furthermore, we have constructed a range of point mutations on the GR signal sequence changing positive amino acid residues and stretches of hydrophobic amino acid residues. Overall single mutations had a greater effect on mitochondrial import compared to import into chloroplasts. We have also shown that the recognition of the GR processing site differs between MPP and SPP. Single amino acid substitutions in the vicinity of the processing site clearly affected processing by MPP while processing by SPP showed low sensitivity to single mutations...|$|R

40|$|During evolution, chloroplasts have relinquished the {{majority}} of their genes to the nucleus. The products of transferred genes are imported into the organelle {{with the help of an}} import machinery that is distributed across the inner and outer plastid membranes. The evolutionary origin of this machinery is puzzling because, in the putative predecessors, the cyanobacteria, the outer two membranes, the plasma membrane, and the lipopolysaccharide layer lack a functionally similar protein <b>import</b> <b>system.</b> A 75 -kDa protein-conducting channel in the outer envelope of pea chloroplasts, Toc 75, shares ≈ 22 % amino acid identity to a similarly sized protein, designated SynToc 75, encoded in the Synechocystis PCC 6803 genome. Here we show that SynToc 75 is located in the outer membrane (lipopolysaccharide layer) of Synechocystis PCC 6803 and that SynToc 75 forms a voltage-gated, high conductance channel with a high affinity for polyamines and peptides in reconstituted liposomes. These findings suggest that a component of the chloroplast protein <b>import</b> <b>system,</b> Toc 75, was recruited from a preexisting channel-forming protein of the cyanobacterial outer membrane. Furthermore, the presence of a protein in the chloroplastic outer envelope homologous to a cyanobacterial protein provides support for the prokaryotic nature of this chloroplastic membrane...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Nuclear {{import of}} {{proteins}} is typically mediated by their physical interaction with soluble cytosolic receptor proteins via a nuclear localization signal (NLS). A simple genetic assay to detect active NLSs {{based on their}} function in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been previously described. In that system, a chimera consisting of a modified bacterial LexA DNA binding domain and the transcriptional activation domain of the yeast Gal 4 protein is fused to a candidate NLS. A functional NLS will redirect the chimeric fusion to the yeast cell nucleus and activate transcription of a reporter gene. Results We have reengineered this nuclear <b>import</b> <b>system</b> to expand its utility and tested it using known NLS sequences from adenovirus E 1 A. Firstly, the vector has been reconstructed to reduce the level of chimera expression. Secondly, an irrelevant "stuffer" sequence from the E. coli maltose binding protein was used to {{increase the size of}} the chimera above the passive diffusion limit of the nuclear pore complex. The improved vector also contains an expanded multiple cloning site and a hemagglutinin epitope tag to allow confirmation of expression. Conclusion The alterations in expression level and composition of the fusions used in this nuclear <b>import</b> <b>system</b> greatly reduce background activity in β-galactosidase assays, improving sensitivity and allowing more quantitative analysis of NLS bearing sequences. </p...|$|R
