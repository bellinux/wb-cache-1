5|$|Later in the game, {{the player}} acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a {{standard}} fire mode, {{the ability to}} create force fields to block enemy fire, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls. Enemies also have the same capabilities, requiring the player {{to take advantage of the}} three gun modes and the environment to overcome them.|$|E
5|$|The daric {{was called}} dārayaka within the empire and {{was most likely}} named after Darius. In an effort to further improve trade, Darius built canals, {{underground}} waterways <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> navy. He further improved and expanded the network of roads and way stations throughout the empire, {{so that there was}} a system of travel authorization for the King, satraps and other high officials, which entitled the traveller to draw provisions at daily stopping places.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} other {{characters}} in Little Annie Fanny are derived from Gray's Little Orphan Annie. Sugardaddy Bigbucks, Annie's surrogate father <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful,</b> manipulative capitalist, is based on Daddy Warbucks. His mysterious assistant, the Wasp, derives from Warbucks' assistant the Asp, and Punchjab, his bodyguard, comes from the character Punjab. Other supporting characters include ad man Benton Battbarton (whose name is taken from the advertising agencies Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn and Benton & Bowles), Battbarton's rival Huck Buxton (modeled on gap-toothed British actor Terry-Thomas), Duncan Fyfe Hepplewhite (an art plagiarist), and Freddie Flink (who resembles comic actor Fred Gwynne from Car 54, Where Are You?).|$|E
5|$|Although fewer postcranial remains {{have been}} {{discovered}} for Hadropithecus than for Archaeolemur, what has been found indicates that both were adapted for a terrestrial or semi-terrestrial lifestyle, an unusual trait for lemurs. Both genera had short limbs <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> build. Due to its specialized dentition and likely diet, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been the more terrestrial of the two, since Archaeolemur may have sent more time foraging and sleeping in the trees. Both genera also have shortened hands and feet, an adaptation for walking on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{vary greatly}} in overall shape. Some, {{such as the}} cockles, have shells that are nearly globular; cockles can jump by bending and {{straightening}} their foot. Others, such as the razor clams, are burrowing specialists with elongated shells <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> foot adapted for rapid digging. The shipworms, in the family Teredinidae have greatly elongated bodies, but their shell valves are much reduced and restricted to the anterior end of the body, where they function as scraping organs that permit the animal to dig tunnels through wood.|$|E

5|$|John, Duke of Berry (1340–1416) was Charles VI's uncle <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> {{figure in}} the kingdom, {{as well as the}} most famous and extravagant {{collector}} and commissioner of art of his day. He is still best known for commissioning the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, the famous International Gothic illuminated manuscript, and also commissioned the Holy Thorn Reliquary, now in the British Museum. The young king Charles had been forced to remove his uncle from governorships after the latter's rapacious conduct had led to unrest, and the meeting in 1391 marked their reconciliation after a period of bad relations. Lavish gifts among the Valois court circle were routine, and on this occasion Berry had special reason to be generous.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} Lima, {{he stopped}} in Riobamba, {{where a group of}} priests asked him to write a reply to a report written by Ignacio Barreto, chief tax collector. The report accused the priests of Riobamba of various abuses against the Indians in order to take their money. Espejo gladly {{accepted}} the task because he wanted to settle accounts with Barreto and other citizens of Riobamba, among them José Miguel Vallejo, who had turned him in to the authorities when he tried to flee Requena's expedition to the Marañón river. He wrote Defensa de los curas de Riobamba (Defense of the clergy of Riobamba), a detailed study of the way of life of the Indians from Riobamba <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> attack on Barreto's report.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{studies for}} large destroyers capable of {{defending}} the French battleline against attacks by enemy destroyers and torpedo boats by the Naval General Staff (NGS) began before World War I, but were suspended {{when the war}} began. They resumed in 1917, but serious planning did not begin until after the war when the NGS decided to split {{the role of the}} destroyer in 1919. The smaller torpilleur d'escadre would have the role of attacking the enemy's battleline with torpedoes and defending that of the French from enemy torpedo craft. The primary role of the larger contre-torpilleur was scouting; defending the battleline was secondary and attacking the enemy battleline least important. This required high speed in all weather, good endurance <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> armament capable of engaging small cruisers.|$|E

5|$|Sir Charles Lyell (1797–1875) {{was also}} from Angus and his Principles of Geology built on Hutton's ideas. Lyell's theory of uniformitarianism and his {{interpretation}} of geologic change as the steady accumulation of minute changes over enormously long spans of time was a central theme in the Principles, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> influence on the young Charles Darwin. (Robert FitzRoy, captain of HMS Beagle, loaned Darwin a copy of Volume 1 of the first edition just before they {{set out on the}} 'Voyage of the Beagle'.) Lyell is buried in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Sirenians first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Early Eocene and significantly diversified throughout the epoch. They inhabited rivers, estuaries, and nearshore marine waters. Sirenians, unlike other marine mammals such as cetaceans, lived in the New World. The earliest aquatic sirenian discovered is Prorastomus which dates back to 40 million years ago, and the first known sirenian, the quadruped Pezosiren, lived 50 million years ago. Prorastomidae and Protosirenidae, the earliest sirenian families, consisted of pig-like amphibious creatures who died {{out at the end of}} the Eocene. When the Dugongidae appeared at this time, sirenians had evolved the characteristics of modern variety, including an aquatic streamlined body with flipper-like front legs with no hind limbs, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> tail with horizontal caudal fins which uses an up-and-down motion to move them through the water.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 Groundhog Day tornado {{outbreak}} was a localized but devastating tornado {{event that}} took place in central Florida early on February 2, 2007. Early morning temperatures had risen well above average for the season; combined with increased moisture <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> jet stream, this created enough instability and wind shear for thunderstorms to rotate and spawn tornadoes. Due to the conditions, a long-tracked supercell formed and produced three tornadoes over one hour and seventeen minutes. The supercell resulted in a 70-mile (110-kilometer) trail of damage.|$|E

5|$|The {{army was}} well {{organised}} {{and this was}} the reason for PulakeshinII's success beyond the Vindyas. It consisted of an infantry, a cavalry, an elephant corps <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> navy. The Chinese traveller Hiuen-Tsiang wrote that the Chalukyan army had hundreds of elephants which were intoxicated with liquor prior to battle. It was with their navy that they conquered Revatidvipa (Goa), and Puri on east coast of India. Rashtrakuta inscriptions use the term Karnatabala when referring to the powerful Chalukya armies.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Mk. IV in July 1940 {{improved}} matters, {{but it was the}} delivery of the Bristol Beaufighter starting in August that produced a truly effective system. The Beaufighter had considerably more powerful engines, speed that allowed it to catch its targets, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> gun pack of four 20mm cannon that could easily destroy a bomber in a single pass. Squadron use began in October, and its first victory came soon after on 19/20 November when a Beaufighter IF of No. 604 Squadron destroyed a Ju 88A-5 near Chichester, very close to the first success of the Mk. III.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of June 1807, the Emperor reassessed his strategic situation and decided {{that he needed to}} move northeast, in order to prevent Bennigsen's Russian army from using the bridge at Friedland to cross the Alle river. If the Russians managed to cross the Alle river at Friedland, they could then move closer to their Prussian allies, who were based in Königsberg. Napoleon drew up a plan, giving Marshal Murat two army corps <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> cavalry reserve, with orders to march on Königsberg, while sending the rest of the troops towards Friedland. Leading the thrust towards Friedland was Marshal Jean Lannes's Reserve Corps (two infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade), with Grouchy's dragoons and Nansouty's horse carabiniers and cuirassiers temporarily attached. In Murat's absence, Grouchy was the senior cavalry commander and was to take overall command of all the cavalry that remained with the Emperor.|$|E

5|$|In June 1341, Andronikos III died suddenly, and a power {{struggle}} developed between Kantakouzenos, who initially assumed the powers of regency over Andronikos's underage son John V Palaiologos, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> faction around the Patriarch John XIV Kalekas, the Empress-dowager Anna of Savoy and Alexios Apokaukos on the other. The dispute soon developed in outright conflict when the Patriarch, the Empress, and Apokaukos replaced Kantakouzenos as regent and imprisoned his family and supporters. In response, Kantakouzenos proclaimed himself emperor at Didymoteichon in October. The news of Kantakouzenos's proclamation sparked a wave of popular resistance across Macedonia and Thrace. The common people, impoverished by an exploitative and over-powerful aristocracy, viewed Kantakouzenos {{as a representative of}} the hated aristocrats and rallied behind the legitimate Palaiologos line and one by one, the cities were seized in the name of the Constantinopolitan regency. Thessalonica at first remained tranquil, and Synadenos contacted his old friend Kantakouzenos with the intention of surrendering the city to him. Such a move might well prove decisive, as possession of Thessalonica would enable Kantakouzenos to control Macedonia, Thessaly and Epirus, and in March 1342, he set out from Didymoteichon with his army in the direction of the city. Before he arrived there, however, Synadenos was overthrown and driven from the city by a rebellion led by a radical popular faction, the Zealots. Apokaukos with a fleet came to reinforce the new regime, and one of his sons was installed as its new governor.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is {{primarily}} composed of hydrogen with {{a quarter of}} its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Many of the game's non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) are companion characters, {{who appear}} throughout {{the game and}} may volunteer their services. Companions include Alistair, a reluctantly heroic Grey Warden with a sarcastic wit; Morrigan, a sultry but cynical dark mage who has little regard for authority or social mores; Leliana, an ex-member of Ferelden's Chantry whose optimistic and virtuous demeanor belies an aptitude for espionage and combat; Sten, a proud but stoic warrior of the militaristic Qunari people who often questions human ways; Oghren, a brutal dwarven warrior whose love of alcohol is only matched by his penchant for violence and loyalty to his friends; Wynne, an Elder Mage of the Circle, a maternal figure to the party <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> healer; Zevran, a rakish elven assassin who is fond of treasures, sex and innuendo; and a loyal Mabari War Hound, which the player can name and use for scouting and combat.
