5|$|Clathrus ruber was {{originally}} described by Micheli from Italy. It is considered native to southern and central continental Europe, {{as well as}} Macaronesia (the Azores and the Canary Islands), western Turkey, North Africa (<b>Algeria),</b> <b>and</b> western Asia (Iran). The fungus is rare in central Europe, and is listed in the Red data book of Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|In 1954 {{author and}} {{explorer}} Cecily Mackworth published the biography The Destiny of Isabelle Eberhardt after following Eberhardt's routes in <b>Algeria</b> <b>and</b> the Sahara. The book inspired Paul Bowles to translate some of Eberhardt's writings into English. Novelist William Bayer published Visions of Isabelle, a fictionalised 1976 {{account of her}} life. In 1981 Timberlake Wertenbaker premiered New Anatomies, a play about Eberhardt.|$|E

5|$|The boccamela group (large weasels): Very large weasels {{with large}} skulls, {{relatively}} long tails and lighter coloured pelts.

5|$|A mass exile of Mozambique's {{political}} intelligentsia to neighbouring countries provided havens {{from which}} radical Mozambicans could plan actions and foment political unrest in their homeland. The {{formation of the}} Mozambican guerrilla organisation FRELIMO {{and the support of}} the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Tanzania, Zambia, Egypt, <b>Algeria</b> <b>and</b> Gaddafi regime in Libya through arms and advisers, led to the outbreak of violence that was to last over a decade.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the results}} of the operation, the SOE and Combined Operations Headquarters {{believed}} that the SSRF could still be of use, and ensured that it was not dissolved. Command of the unit was given to the newly promoted Major Appleyard. At the end of 1942, most of SSRF were moved to <b>Algeria</b> <b>and</b> absorbed into the 2nd Special Air Service Regiment. Appleyard did not survive the war. He was returning from a Special Air Service mission when his plane was reported missing. It was the same day that Captain Hayes was executed in Paris.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{approximately}} 169 million standard {{cubic meters}} (SCM) of helium were extracted from natural gas or withdrawn from helium reserves with approximately 78% from the United States, 10% from <b>Algeria,</b> <b>and</b> {{most of the}} remainder from Russia, Poland and Qatar. By 2013, increases in helium production in Qatar (under the company RasGas managed by Air Liquide) had increased Qatar's fraction of world helium production to 25%, and made it the second largest exporter after the United States.|$|E
5|$|In Asia, Theodoxus fluviatilis {{is found}} in Turkey. It {{can also be found}} in Iran, in the provinces of Kerman, Gilan, Mazandaran, Fars, Hormozgan, Lorestan and Khorasan. However, until 2012, all the records from Iran were listed as Theodoxus doriae. In Africa this species occurs in <b>Algeria,</b> <b>and</b> {{possibly}} (or probably) in Morocco, where there are records which some authors consider to be reliable. However, instead of one species, Theodoxus fluviatilis, Brown (1994) recognized three species in northwestern Africa: Theodoxus numidicus, Theodoxus maresi, Theodoxus meridionalis.|$|E
5|$|Isabelle Wilhelmine Marie Eberhardt (17 February 1877– 21 October 1904) was a Swiss {{explorer}} and writer. As a teenager, Eberhardt, {{educated in}} Switzerland by her father, published short stories under a male pseudonym. She {{became interested in}} North Africa, and was considered a proficient writer on the subject despite learning about the region only through correspondence. After an invitation from photographer Louis David, Eberhardt moved to Algeria in May 1897. She dressed as a man and converted to Islam, eventually adopting the name Si Mahmoud Saadi. Eberhardt's unorthodox behaviour made her an outcast among European settlers in <b>Algeria</b> <b>and</b> the French administration.|$|E

5|$|Members of the {{nuthatch}} family live {{in most of}} North America and Europe {{and throughout}} Asia down to the Wallace Line. Nuthatches are sparsely represented in Africa; one species lives in a small area of northeastern <b>Algeria</b> <b>and</b> a population of the Eurasian nuthatch subspecies, S. e. hispaniensis, lives {{in the mountains of}} Morocco. Most species are resident year-round. The only significant migrant is the red-breasted nuthatch, which winters widely across North America, deserting the northernmost parts of its breeding range in Canada; it has been recorded as a vagrant in Bermuda, Iceland and England.|$|E
5|$|Sadat {{also played}} his role the {{deception}} plan; in September he had attended the Non-Aligned conference in <b>Algeria,</b> <b>and</b> {{upon his return}} was rumored to be ill. Sadat remained, for several {{days leading up to}} 6 October, out of public sight. Egyptian intelligence planted false stories of his illness in the press and initiated a search for a home in Europe, where Sadat would receive treatment, adding to the rumor's credibility.|$|E
5|$|The French {{government}} {{claimed that}} it had not anticipated that such a massive number would leave; it believed that perhaps 300,000 might choose to depart temporarily and that a large portion would return to Algeria. The administration had set aside funds for absorption of those it called repatriates to partly reimburse them for property losses. The administration avoided acknowledging the true numbers of refugees in order to avoid upsetting its Algeria policies. Consequently, few plans were made for their return, and, psychologically at least, many of the Pieds-Noirs were alienated from both <b>Algeria</b> <b>and</b> France.|$|E

5|$|A French {{military}} flying column then marched toward Antananarivo, losing {{many men}} to malaria and other diseases. Reinforcements came from <b>Algeria</b> <b>and</b> Sub-Saharan Africa. Upon reaching {{the city in}} September 1895, the column bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, causing heavy casualties and leading Queen Ranavalona III to surrender. France annexed Madagascar in 1896 and declared the island a colony the following year, dissolving the Merina monarchy and sending the royal family into exile on Réunion Island and to Algeria. A two-year resistance movement organized {{in response to the}} French capture of the royal palace was effectively put {{down at the end of}} 1897.|$|E
5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} family, Workman was {{educated in the}} finest schools {{available}} to women and traveled in Europe. Her marriage to William Hunter Workman cemented these advantages, and, after being introduced to climbing in New Hampshire, Fanny Workman traveled the world with him. They were able to capitalize on their wealth and connections to voyage around Europe, North Africa, and Asia. The couple had two children, but Fanny Workman was not a motherly type; they left their children in schools and with nurses, and Workman saw herself as a New Woman who could equal any man. The Workmans began their travels with bicycle tours of Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, <b>Algeria</b> <b>and</b> India. They cycled thousands of miles, sleeping wherever they could find shelter. They wrote books about each trip and Fanny frequently commented {{on the state of}} the lives of women that she saw. Their early bicycle tour narratives were better received than their mountaineering books.|$|E
5|$|Following Ranavalona's death, {{her aunt}} Ramasindrazana left <b>Algeria</b> <b>and</b> moved to Alpes-Maritimes {{where she lived}} out the few {{remaining}} years of her life. The heir-apparent, Marie-Louise, had left Ranavalona's villa several years earlier to study at a French high school and {{would go on to}} marry a French agricultural engineer named Andre Bosshard on June 24, 1921. Although she continued to receive a small pension from the French government throughout her lifetime, Marie-Louise chose to pursue a career as a nurse and was awarded the Legion of Honor for her medical services during World War II. After Bosshard and the childless Marie-Louise divorced, the young woman reportedly made the most of her new-found freedom as a flamboyant and vivacious socialite. Marie-Louise died in Bazoches-sur-le-Betz on January 18, 1948, without leaving any descendants, and was buried in Montreuil, France.|$|E
