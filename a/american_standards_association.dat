25|$|Briggs {{took over}} the Bureau during {{difficult}} times. It was {{the height of the}} depression and his first task was to reduce costs 50%. He managed to save the jobs of about 2/3 of the career employees by putting many on part-time employment and transferring others to the <b>American</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>Association</b> while they continued their work at the bureau. He emphasized doing work with direct economic impact and got money from the Works Progress Administration to hire unemployed mathematicians to develop math tables. Due to Briggs outstanding persuasive powers, he managed to get Congress to increase its appropriation for the Bureau in 1935, and many of the employees that were let go were re-hired.|$|E

Statistical methods were widely applied during World War II, but faded into disuse a few years later in the face of huge overseas demand for American mass-produced products.|$|E
2500|$|The Selectric {{keyboard}} layout differed {{in certain ways}} from the traditional layout of mechanical typewriters, notably in the placement of symbols, which largely dated back to the Remington No. 2 (1878), the first typewriter with a shift key and extensive symbols. Notably, it moved [...] "_' off of the digits 268, replacing them with @¢*, and instead placing '" [...] and -_ as pairs on keys. This change was made because smaller characters need to hit the paper with less force, and consolidating smaller characters such as '" [...] into a pair on a single key avoided needing to adjust the force based on shift state. The Selectric layout became standard for electric typewriters in the US, and was inherited by the IBM PC (1981), and thence by many computer keyboards, particularly via the influential Model M (1985). In computer keyboard standards, this was formalized in the <b>American</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>Association</b> X4.14-1971 standard as typewriter pairing (colloquially a typewriter-paired keyboard), along with bit-paired keyboards, but became the only standard in the successor X4.23-1982 standard.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY The {{theoretical}} knowledge and practical performance of 166 lay people attending a short cardiopulmonary resuscitation course were evaluated {{according to the}} <b>American</b> Heart <b>Association</b> <b>standards.</b> Before tt course no participant was able to perform even a bad attempt at cardiopulmo-nary resuscitation. Theoretical 'knowledge was good {{at the end of}} the course and at the refresher course six months later. At the end of the initial course 65 % (57 / 88) of the participants amined could adequately compress and ventilate the manikin. After six months 44 % (30 / 68) could perform resuscitation adequately. Women were as proficient as men, and elderly people in general were as proficient as the younger ones. The skill of carotid artery palpation was surprisingly well retained after six months. Data on pulmonary ventilation and cardiac massage were recorded simultaneously on a recording resuscitation manikn. When these objective data were compared with the <b>American</b> Heart <b>Association</b> <b>standards</b> only a few participants were able to perform correct cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The number of compressions and ventilations per minute were often insufficient. A large discrepancy between self, subjective, and objective assessment of cardiopulmonary resuscita-tion knowledge and performance was found.
