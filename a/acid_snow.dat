The concentrations of sodium ions and sea-salt sulfate ions that origi-nated from the Sea of Japan decreased exponentially from Hakui city in Ishikawa Prefecture to Toyama city. The concentration of non sea-salt sulfate ions, which probably originate from human activities, also decreased exponen-tially, but it was lower than the concentration of sea-salt sulfate ions until 25 km from Hakui city and higher in the farther regions. We considered that {{this was due to}} additive effects of non sea-salt sulfate ions transported from a distance and local sulfate ions. The concentration of non sea-salt sulfate ions transported from the Asian Continent was estimated in each sampling station. Its contribution was 0. 98 of the total at the coast of Hakui city and 0. 65 at Toyama city, respectively, and showed a pattern similar to those of sodium ions and sea-salt sulfate ions.

40|$|Reconstruction of past {{changes in}} Arctic sea ice extent may be {{critical}} for understanding its future evolution. Methanesulfonate (MSA) and bromine concentrations preserved in ice cores {{have both been}} proposed as indicators of past sea ice conditions. In this study, two ice cores from central and north-eastern Greenland were analysed at sub-annual resolution for MSA (CH 3 SO 3 H) and bromine, covering the time period 1750 – 2010. We examine correlations between ice core MSA and the HadISST 1 ICE sea ice dataset and consult back trajectories to infer the likely source regions. A strong correlation between the low-frequency MSA and bromine records during pre-industrial times indicates that both chemical species are likely linked to processes occurring on or near sea ice in the same source regions. The positive correlation between ice core MSA and bromine persists until the mid- 20 th century, when the acidity of Greenland ice begins to increase markedly due to increased fossil fuel emissions. After that time, MSA levels decrease {{as a result of}} declining sea ice extent but bromine levels increase.

40|$|Snowmelt {{collected}} from snow cores {{taken from the}} 1982 spring snowpack in the Wasatch Mountains of northern Utah lacked mineral acidity and retained enough buffering capacity {{in the form of}} calcium and magnesium bicarbonates to titrate additional inputs of strong acid equivalent to the amount apparently already neutralized. While acid anion concentrations were higher than those found in pristine areas, they were much lower than those reported for winter precipitation in other western areas experiencing acidification of precipitation. Snowmelt pH ranged from 5. 62 to 6. 88 (mean = 6. 17), and sulfate was relatively more important than nitrate, showing an average equivalent ratio of 3. 1 : 1. Patterns of pH indicated decreasing pH with distance from sources of soil-derived buffering capacity in the semiarid valleys to the east. Although acid anion concentration patterns failed to point to pollution sources along the Wasatch Front, chloride concentration patterns indicated that the Salt Lake Valley airshed influenced snow chemistry in the mountains. Snowmelt studies carried on in the laboratory and at a field site in Logan Canyon indicated that, for the alkaline snow typical of 1982, the first melt fractions had a higher pH (less acidity) than did the bulk snow. The opposite situation is typically found for <b>acid</b> <b>snow.</b> Although no acidity was present, snow pH increased by 13 percent as a result of contact with organic litter on the soil surface of a 22 m, 32 percent slope. The pH increased even more rapidly in a nearby intermittent stream 9 to 7. 78 {{at the edge of the}} snowpack). Difficulties in interpreting the data from the snow cores in this study include the effects of an unusually wet winter, uncharacteristically low levels of industrial activity due to economic factors, uncertainty about the relative amounts of acidity and buffering capacity reaching the sensitive Uintah Mountain watersheds to the east, and failure to distinguish between soil and acid derived sulfates. Analysis of these difficulties suggests taht offsetting factors would tend to cancel effects of precipitation amount during wet-to-normal winters. the remaining factors require additional research...|$|E

Approximately 90 % of the samples contained total aldehyde concentrations up to 40 μM. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were the dominant aldehydes observed; secondary aldehydes included glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and benzaldehyde. The highest aldehyde concentrations were observed in snow collected in areas where deciduous and coniferous forests are widespread. However, these aldehydes can be attributed also in part to primary and secondary products of anthropogenic activities. Formic and acetic were analyzed in all measured samples with concentrations ranging from 0. 5 to 4. 9 μM for HCOOH and from < 0. 3 to 13. 4 μM for CH_ 3 COOH. Maximum contribution of organic acids to precipitation-free acidity, calculated by assuming that the only sources of the measured formate and acetate were their respective acid forms, averaged 43. 1 % for samples with a pH⩽ 5.

A series of linear dicarboxylic acids from C 5 to C 13 and phthalic acid, were identified and quantified. In several samples the biogenic acid pinonic acid was also observed. In fresh snow the median concentration of the most abundant acid, adipic acid, was 0. 69 μg L − 1 in 2006 and 0. 70 μg L − 1 in 2007. Glutaric acid was the second most abundant dicarboxylic acid found with median values of 0. 46 μg L − 1 in 2006 and 0. 61 μg L − 1 in 2007, while the aromatic acid phthalic acid showed a median concentration of 0. 34 μg L − 1 in 2006 and 0. 45 μg L − 1 in 2007.

C_ 2 -C_ 8 dicarboxylic acids showed clear seasonal changes with higher concentration in summer than in winter. This suggested that low molecular weight dicarboxylic acids were produced by photochemical reactions. Concentrations of dicarboxylic acids at Dome Fuji Station were about 20 {{times higher than the}} snow samples collected on the route from Syowa Station to Dome Fuji Station. The concentrations of maleic acid and phthalic acid (derived from photochemical oxidation of anthropogenic aromatic hydrocarbons) at Dome Fuji Station was about 40 times higher than the route samples. In contrast, the concentrations of C_ 8 and C_ 9 diacids (derived from photochemical oxidation of biogenic unsaturated fatty acids) at Dome Fuji Station were only 3 - 5 times higher than the route samples. This comparison suggests that surface snow samples at Dome Fuji Station contained photooxidation products of anthropogenic organic matter, suggesting that the diacids are emitted from incomplete combustion of fossil fuel used at the Station and/or produced in the atmosphere by photooxidation of exhaust gases. On the other hand, concentration ratios of fumaric acid (trans-C_ 4 unsaturated diacid) to maleic acid (cis-C_ 4 unsaturated diacid) showed higher values in summer than in winter, suggesting that cis to trans isomerization occurs photochemically in the atmosphere and possibly in the snow surface.

In the log cultivation of snow ear, it was found that the higher concentrations of ODA, the higher yield of snow ear at the first, second flush and the sum of the first and second flush. For the application of ODA on snow ear cultivation, the use of more than 5 ppm ODA was suggested. The flavor qualities of ear mushroom were lower than other mushrooms.
