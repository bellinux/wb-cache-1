40|$|The {{synthesis}} of isotactic poly(N-butenyl-carbazole) (i-PBK) by using homogeneous isospecific Ziegler-Natta catalytic system is reported. The achieved polymer is crystalline and shows, to DSC and X-ray analysis, two distinct crystalline phases. i-PBK FTIR spectrum and X-ray diffraction pattern are {{compared with those}} of poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK). The observed differences are tentatively associated with higher flexibility of the i-PBK chains due to the <b>alkylene</b> <b>group</b> connecting the carbazole group to the main chain. i-PBK optical properties are also {{compared with those of}} PVK and isotactic poly(N-pentenyl-carbazole) (i-PPK), a higher homologue of i-PBK recently used as emitting layer in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) showing white light emission. The close similarity of the fluorescence spectra of i-PBK and i-PPK is a promising basis for optical applications of this polymer...|$|E

40|$|Two {{series of}} dimers, {{in which two}} {{identical}} aromatic bent core mesogenic units are connected via an organosiloxane or an alkylene spacer, have been investigated. The dimers with a spacer consisting of a trisiloxane central group and relatively long <b>alkylene</b> <b>groups</b> show an intercalated tilted smectic structure. The layer spacings appear to be very weakly dependent on the terminal chain lengths. In these dimers the smectic phase is stabilized for the compounds with a short terminal chain. Dimers with an aliphatic alkylene spacer are liquid crystalline only when the spacer is relatively short and the terminal chains are long. For these dimers a monolayer tilted smectic phase is observed...|$|R
40|$|The ultra-violet (UV) and vacuum ultra-violet (VUV) {{resistance}} of bridging <b>alkylene</b> <b>groups</b> in organosilica films has been investigated. Similar to the Si-CH 3 (methyl) bonds, the Si-CH 2 -Si (methylene) bonds are {{not affected by}} 5. 6 eV irradiation. On the other hand, the concentration of the Si-CH 2 -CH 2 -Si (ethylene) groups decreases during such UV exposure. More significant difference in alkylene reduction is observed when the films are exposed to VUV (7. 2 eV). The ethylene groups are depleted by more than 75 % while only about 40 % methylene and methyl groups loss is observed. The different sensitivity of bridging groups to VUV light {{should be taken into}} account during the development of curing and plasma etch processes of low-k materials based on periodic mesoporous organosilicas and oxycarbosilanes. The experimental results are qualitatively supported by ab-initio quantum-chemical calculations...|$|R
40|$|Electron {{transfer}} (ET) in molecular donor-acceptor dye {{systems is}} crucial for charge transport in organic semiconductors. Classically, ET rates should decrease with increasing donor-acceptor distance while the microscopic mechanism is more complex and shows intricate dependencies on the excitation conditions. In this paper, we introduce highly soluble N,N'-dialkyl perylene dihydrazides (PDH) - perylene dyes with a dialkylamino -NR_ 2 donor functionality directly bonded to both of their imide nitrogen atoms. We compare the PDH electron-transfer dynamics {{with a group of}} classical N,N'-bisalkylperylene diimides (PDI) equipped with a -NR_ 2 donor linked to the PDI acceptor core via a varying number of alkylene -(CH_ 2) - spacer groups, thus at distinctively different distance. Special physicochemical design features of our study objects include: i) amine moieties as donor group to minimize spin-orbit coupling; ii) substitution solely at both imide positions to avoid major impact on HOMO and LUMO levels and distortions of the PDI backbone; iii) control of donor-acceptor separation by non-conjugated <b>alkylene</b> <b>groups</b> to exclude any additional effects due to delocalized π electron systems. All materials show non-single-exponential photoluminescence decay dynamics. A rate equation analysis supported by electrochemical and absolute photoluminescence efficiency measurements yields evidence for efficient intersystem-crossing without heavy elements and reveals that the charge-transfer efficiency across the intramolecular interface strongly depends on the surplus excitation energy...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMultiple-stage mass {{spectrometry}} involving consecutive collision-activated dissociation reactions {{was used to}} examine the structures of fragment ions commonly formed on electron ionization of organophosphorus esters. The compounds studied include several aryl thiophosphates, some of which are analogs of common pesticides. Energy-resolved collision-activated dissociation experiments allow the dissociation of the molecular ions of these compounds in such a manner that only a few fragment ions dominate the spectrum. An abundant fragment ion of m/z 109, formed from all of the compounds studied, can have at least four different stable structures: (CH 3 O) 2 PO+, CH 3 CH 2 OP(O) OH+, CH 2 =CHOP(H) (OH) 2 +, and (CH 2 O) 2 P(H) OH+. The structure of the fragment ion of m/z 109 was found to reflect the phosphorus-containing part of the compounds studied. Another abundant fragment ion obtained for all the aryl esters studied is structurally characteristic of the aromatic moiety of the molecule. This fragment ion {{is the result of a}} complex rearrangement involving transfer of an <b>alkylene</b> <b>group</b> to the aromatic ring from the phosphorus-containing part of the molecular ion. The utility of these fragment ions in the structural characterization of unknown organophosphorus esters is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Sol-gel {{processing}} of materials is plagued by shrinkage during polymerization of the alkoxide monomers and processing (aging and drying) {{of the resulting}} gels. The authors have developed {{a new class of}} hybrid organic-inorganic materials based on the solventless ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of monomers bearing the 2, 2, 5, 5 -tetramethyl- 2, 5 -disilaoxacyclopentyl group, which permits them to drastically reduce shrinkage in sol-gel processed materials. Because the monomers are polymerized through a chain growth mechanism catalyzed by base rather than the step growth mechanism normally used in sol-gel systems, hydrolysis and condensation products are entirely eliminated. Furthermore, since water is not required for hydrolysis, an alcohol solvent is not necessary. Monomers with two disilaoxacyclopentyl groups, separated by a rigid phenylene group or a more flexible <b>alkylene</b> <b>group,</b> were prepared through disilylation of the corresponding diacetylenes, followed by ring closure and hydrogenation. Anionic polymerization of these materials, either neat or with 2, 2, 5, 5 -tetramethyl- 2, 5 -disila- 1 -oxacyclopentane as a copolymer, affords thermally stable transparent gels with no visible shrinkage. These materials provide an easy route to the introduction of sol-gel type materials in encapsulation of microelectronics, which they have successfully demonstrated...|$|E
