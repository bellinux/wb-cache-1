25|$|Southard {{remained}} fit and <b>active</b> <b>well</b> {{into his}} seniority; anecdotes abound of him performing feats of athleticism in his 70s. Late in life, his preferred mode of personal transport was a basket phaetona type of horse-drawn carriage {{with a reputation}} for being fast and dangerous. Southard was a Freemason, a member of the Knights of Pythias and of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. He died at Richmond, Maine, aged 88, on September 15, 1896, his wife Jane surviving him by barely a month. Their son Charles closed the Southard family shipyard not long after in 1899.|$|E
25|$|Several of Benwell's cousins were artistically talented. His first cousin, William Arnee Frank (1809–1897), {{the son of}} {{his aunt}} Hannah Benwell, was also an artist who {{published}} a series of lithographs of Bristol views in 1831 held at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. His landscape watercolours were mostly of views around Bristol, the Wye Valley and North Wales and he was <b>active</b> <b>well</b> into his eighties, still showing work at the West of England Academy in 1891. Another first cousin, son of his aunt Rebecca Benwell, was David Holt (1828–1880), a published poet (including Poems, Rural and Miscellaneous, publ. Gillett 1846; A Lay of Hero Worship, and other poems, publ. Pickering, 1850 and Janus, Lake Sonnets etc. and other Poems, publ. George Bell, 1853). His second cousin (once-removed) was Thomas Benwell Latchmore (1832–1908), the photographer from Hitchin whose works from the early 1860s are documented in the Hitchin Museum and Art Gallery. Another cousin taught art and drawing at a Quaker school.|$|E

500|$|Beebe {{remained}} <b>active</b> <b>well</b> {{into his}} old age. In 1957, {{at the age}} of eighty, he was still capable of climbing slippery tree trunks in order to study bird nests. However, by 1959 his strength had lessened enough that long hikes and tree climbing were no longer practical for him, and he contented himself with work that could be conducted in the laboratory, such as dissecting birds' nests to analyze their method of construction. Beebe also began to be afflicted with a throat ailment which may have been Sjögren's syndrome, although lacking a complete understanding of what caused it, Beebe and his doctors referred to it as [...] "mango mouth". Beebe was reluctant to accept speaking engagements because of the effect this had on his voice, although he continued to give lectures on occasion with Jocelyn's help.|$|E
500|$|During 1976–77, in {{the midst}} of the {{original}} UK punk movement, bands emerged such as Manchester's Joy Division, the Fall, and Magazine, Leeds' Gang of Four, and London's the Raincoats that became central post-punk figures. Some bands classified as post-punk, such as Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire, had been <b>active</b> <b>well</b> before the punk scene coalesced; others, such as the Slits and Siouxsie and the Banshees, transitioned from punk rock into post-punk. A few months after the Sex Pistols' breakup, John Lydon (no longer [...] "Rotten") cofounded Public Image Ltd. Lora Logic, formerly of X-Ray Spex, founded Essential Logic. Killing Joke formed in 1979. These bands were often musically experimental, like certain new wave acts; defining them as [...] "post-punk" [...] was a sound that tended to be less pop and more dark and abrasive—sometimes verging on the atonal, as with Subway Sect and Wire—and an anti-establishment posture directly related to punk's. Post-punk reflected a range of art rock influences from Syd Barrett and Captain Beefheart to David Bowie and Roxy Music to Krautrock.|$|E

2500|$|Some street-oriented mods, usually {{of lesser}} means, {{sometimes}} referred to as hard mods, remained <b>active</b> <b>well</b> into the late 60s, but tended to become increasingly detached from the Swinging London scene and the burgeoning hippie movement. [...] By 1967, they considered {{most of the people in}} the Swinging London scene to be [...] "soft mods" [...] or [...] "peacock mods," [...] as styles, there, became increasingly extravagant, often featuring highly ruffled, brocaded, or laced fabrics in Day-Glo colours. [...] Many of the hard mods lived in the same economically depressed areas of South London as West Indian immigrants, so these mods favored a different kind of attire, that emulated the rude boy look of Trilby hats and too-short trousers. These [...] "aspiring 'white negros listened to Jamaican ska and mingled with black rude boys at West Indian nightclubs like Ram Jam, A-Train and Sloopy's. Hebdige claims that the hard mods were drawn to black culture and ska music in part because the educated, middle-class hippie movement's drug-oriented and intellectual music did not have any relevance for them. He argues that the hard mods were attracted to ska because it was a secret, underground, non-commercialised music that was disseminated through informal channels such as house parties and clubs.|$|E

60|$|When {{he married}} he had {{received}} not only his house but a round sum of money as Sophie's portion. With this he could had he liked have purchased the other shares of the Good Venture; but being, though a sailor, a prudent man, {{he did not like}} to put all his eggs into one basket, and accordingly bought with it a share in another ship. Three children had been born to William and Sophie Martin -- a boy and two girls. Edward, who was the eldest, was at the time this story begins nearly sixteen. He was an <b>active</b> <b>well</b> built young fellow, and had for five years sailed with his father in the Good Venture. That vessel was now lying in the stream {{a quarter of a mile}} higher up, having returned from a trip to Holland upon the previous day. The first evening there had been no callers, for it was an understood thing at Rotherhithe that a captain on his return wanted the first evening at home alone with his wife and family; but on the evening of the second day, when William Martin had finished his work of seeing to the unloading of his ship, the visitors began to drop in fast, and the summer house was well nigh as full as it could hold. Mistress Martin, who was now a comely matron of six-and-thirty, busied herself in seeing that the maid and her daughters, Constance and Janet, supplied the visitors with horns of home brewed beer, or with strong waters brought from Holland for those who preferred them.|$|E

Sage held the field until 1990, at which time they sold it to Whiting Petroleum Corp; Whiting sold some <b>active</b> <b>wells</b> to Crimson Resource Management Corp. in 1994. Crimson ran the field until 2002, at which time they sold their 41 remaining wells to Bentley-Simonson, who held it until April 2005, selling to Plains Exploration & Production, who operated the declining field for slightly more than a year, selling the 14 remaining <b>active</b> <b>wells</b> to their present operator, Vintage Production, in October 2006.|$|R
