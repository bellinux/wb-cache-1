In support of our arguments, we present a performance evaluation study of six different implementations of this algorithm, each successively adopting our optimizations.

The methodology is demonstrated on two multi-robot learning experiments. The first describes learning a tightly-coupled coordination task with two robots, the second a loosely-coupled task with four robots learning social rules. Communication is used to 1) share sensory data to overcome hidden state and 2) share reinforcement to overcome the credit assignment problem between the agents and {{bridge the gap between}} local/individual and global/group payoff. 1 Introduction This paper {{attempts to}} bridge the fields of machine l [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{performance}} of an offloaded AI agent with increasing network latencies and demonstrate that dead reckoning is effective in mitigating the observed degradation. Dead reckoning refers to a class of algorithms typically employed to predict the state of objects in existing games to mitigate the effects of game lag and improve player experience. For a deployed realtime tank game, we found that increasing latencies will cause gradual degradation to {{the performance of}} an AI agent and the performance is severely degraded when latencies reach about 300 ms. We show that a simple implementation of dead reckoning is able to delay the onset of performance degradation for round-trip latencies up to 250 ms and is relatively robust to network jitter and packet loss. Since the observed average latency within the continental North America is approximately 55 ms and inter-continental latencies are in the vicinity of 250 ms, our results demonstrate that it is feasible to offload AI to client machines. Most importantly, our method is practical because it does not require much additional code <b>and</b> <b>it</b> allows offloaded <b>AI</b> agents to be developed in a network-oblivious manner similar to what is presently done for server-based AI. ...|$|R

A total of 79 AI with fresh semen was used on 56 mares (age 4 - 9 years, n = 34; age 10 - 20 years, n = 22). The AI success rate was defined as the number of pregnant mares divided by the number of inseminated mares <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was determined for the time intervals: 0 - 10, 10 - 20 and 20 - 30 minutes after semen collection. Doses of AI containing 2 or 3 billions of spermatozoa with fresh raw semen (n = 34), or with fresh semen extended with a semi skimmed milk (n = 45) were used. The AI success rate was determined with the raw and the extended fresh semen. Results showed that the AI success rate decreased with the time interval (p < 0. 05). There was no difference between AI success rates founded in raw and extended semen with the AI doses of 2 or 3 billions of spermatozoa.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, many K- 12 classes have moved to use open, inquiry-based {{approaches}} to science instruction; research has shown some benefits from these approaches. However, there also exist significant challenges in teaching scientific modeling and inquiry, some based on their nature as metacognitive skills and others based on the general difficulty in providing guided instruction in open-ended exploratory learning contexts. To address these challenges, this dissertation presents a metacognitive tutoring system that teaches students an authentic process of inquiry-driven scientific modeling within an exploratory science learning environment. The design of the metacognitive tutoring system is informed by {{the literature on the}} process of scientific modeling and inquiry in both education <b>and</b> science, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> draws from <b>AI</b> theories of metacognition and intelligent tutoring. The tutoring system monitors the performance of teams of students in an open inquiry task in ecology. The system provides feedback on demand about how well the team is doing in investigating and explaining the system, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> also intervenes when errors in the process are observed or when new abilities are demonstrated. To evaluate this system, a controlled experiment was conducted with 237 students in a middle school life science classroom. In one condition, teams of students completed the activity without the tutoring system enabled, while in the other condition teams interacted with the tutoring system during part of their inquiry and modeling process. Evaluations of this experiment have shown that students who interact with the tutoring system improved in their attitudes toward scientific inquiry and careers in science, and that teams that interact with the tutoring system generate better explanations of ecological phenomena.
