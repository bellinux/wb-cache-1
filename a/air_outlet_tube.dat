40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to observe the changes in the {{oxidation-reduction}} potential of semen under anaerobic condition, and to demonstrate the relationship between the potential and the characteristics of semen. Electrode potential measurements were obtained in diluted semen and in various diluents by employing a platinum electrode enclosed within a slightly modified Michaelis vessel. This was closed by a glass stopper which contained an electrode, an inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>tubes</b> for nitrogen gas, and a saturated agar KCl bridge connected with the calomel half cell. Number of spermatozoa was adjusted to make 5 × 10 ^ 8 per milliliter and five milliliters of test sample were used for studying the electrode potential measurements. After the introduction of test sample into the vessel, 0. 025 milliliters of 0. 5 mM methylene blue were added to the sample. Most of the air was then replaced with purified nitrogen gas, the vessel stoppered and calomel half cell were set up in an incubating bath kept at 35 ℃. All potential measurements were made on a Hitachi-Horiba, F- 5 pH meter. The electrode potential of diluted semen decreased rapidly during approximately first 30 minutes, accompanied by a slow down for additional 30 minutes, after which the potential showed a constant tendency for Eh in general. When the diluted semen was aerated for several seconds by means on babbling <b>air</b> through a <b>outlet</b> <b>tube</b> for nitrogen gas after the potential had reached steady level, it caused a sudden rise in electrode potential. However, this rise rapidly fell to about the original, level within 20 minutes following introduction of nitrogen gas. The treatment of undiluted semen at 60 ℃ for 30 minutes resulted in marked decrease in the reducing ability of semen as compared to a control. The electrode potentials of 0. 9...|$|R

40|$|Microorganisms {{are able}} to produce {{a wide variety of}} {{volatile}} organic compounds. This thesis deals with sampling, analysis and identification of such compounds, produced by microorganisms commonly found in buildings. The volatiles were sampled on adsorbents and analysed by thermal desorption cold trap-injection gas chromatography, with flame ionization and mass-spectrometric detection. The injection was optimized, with respect to the recovery of adsorbed components and the efficiency of the chromatographic separation, using multivariate methods. Eight adsorbents were evaluated with the object of finding the most suitable for sampling microbial volatiles. Among the adsorbents tested, Tenax TA proved to have the best properties for the purpose. Some carbon-containing adsorbents, e. g., Tenax GR and Carbopack B, showed a catalytic effect on thermal decomposition of some compounds, mainly terpene derivatives. Five fungal species, Aspergillus versicolor, Pénicillium commune, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Paecilomyces variotii and Phialophora fastigiata, and anactinomycete, Streptomyces albidoflavus, were cultivated on various artificial media and/or building materials. Cultivation was performed in culture flasks, provided with <b>air</b> inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>tubes.</b> Humidified <b>air</b> was constantly led through the flasks, and samples were taken by attaching adsorbent <b>tubes</b> to the <b>outlet</b> <b>tubes</b> of the flasks. The cultivation medium proved to be of vital importance for metabolite production, quantitatively as well as qualitatively. For Streptomyces albidoflavus the effect of medium, cultivation temperature, and oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the supplied air on the production of volatiles, was studied using multivariate techniques. The medium and the temperature exerted the largest influence, but the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels also affected the amounts of some metabolites produced. The produced volatile metabolites were identified by mass spectrometry and reference compounds. Alcohols, ketones, sulphur compounds and terpenes were most frequently found, but hydrocarbons, ethers and esters were also produced by some species. Among the most commonly produced metabolites, which are also suggested as potential indicator substances for excessive growth of microorganisms in buildings, were 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol, 2 -methyl- 1 -butanol, 3 -methyl- 2 -butanone, 3 -methyl- 2 -pentanone, dimethyl disulphide, -methylfuran,  2, 5 -dimethylfuran and geosmin.

40|$|In {{particular}} the thermal comfort of passengers {{is the essential}} design objective in the cabin air ventilation layout for modern civil passenger aircraft. Solar radiation, electrical equipment, on-board electronics, high power converters, in-flight entertainment and communication devices and most important the heat release of the passengers are representing thermal loads. This heat loads have to be balanced by cold air coming from the air vents of cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets</b> of the <b>air</b> ventilation system. In fact, the temperature distribution inside the passenger cabin can only be controlled by the air conditioning system. Besides providing the passengers with the fresh, an essential task is to avoid discomfort for the passengers by ensuring a good mixing of fresh with aged air and by guaranteeing a high air flow exchange rate for each individual passenger {{according to the requirements}} defined in. Cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets</b> are a crucial device for the air flow distribution within the cabin. Although a high air exchange rate is necessary for thermal comfort the incoming fresh air must not exceed a certain flow velocity in order to avoid gust. Therefore, the air should be evenly distributed by an outlet device, i. e. a plenum, an orifice plate or flow straighteners, before it can leave the outlets through the vents forming a homogeneous planar air jet. This optimal precondition facilitates a successive control of the air distribution within the aircraft cabin. In particular, in the early design phase of aircraft cabin layouts numerical flow simulations are undertaken presuming that this precondition is fulfilled. In fact this is not always the case; hence, design work has to be done to improve cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets.</b> Unfortunately, the space envelope for cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets</b> is quite limited by stringers, insulation, ducting, wires, cables or lining elements. Not only the outer space envelope is a major constraint when designing <b>air</b> <b>outlets,</b> moreover, internal drag and weight {{have a negative impact on}} the power consumption of the Environmental Control System (ECS) and, therefore, on the fuel consumption of the aircraft. Both have to be minimized in order to save power and costs.

Cyclone emission tests were conducted on 1 D- 3 D and 2 D- 2 D cyclones with varied <b>outlet</b> <b>tube</b> sizes and inlet velocities. Talc and wheat dusts were used in testing the laboratory scale models. Data from these tests were used in developing a mathematical computer model capable of predicting outlet dust emissions given the following input variables: dust type and inlet concentration. inlet air velocity, and cyclone type. The model was developed based on the observation that a cyclone fractional efficiency curve (FEC) resembled a normal distribution's cumulative distribution function (CDF). The cut-point and sharpness-of-cut of the FEC were correlated to the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution's CDF, respectively. The model also estimated cyclone pressure drops based on given inlet velocities. Results showed that the correlation of parameters was indeed acceptable. Actual versus program generated emission concentrations were similar, with the estimated emissions being slightly higher. Actual test results showed 1 D- 3 D emission concentrations being less than 2 D- 2 D emissions under similar conditions. Reduced cyclone outlet sizes increased cyclone dust collection efficiencies, but with higher pressure drops. Lower than design inlet velocities reduced cyclone dust collection efficiencies.

30|$|The {{simulated}} temperature {{along the}} inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>tubes</b> {{is shown in}} Fig.  2 b. With an inlet temperature of 6  °C and a flow rate of 450  cm 3  s− 1, we calculated an outlet temperature of 8  °C, which matched the temperature of 8.1  °C measured at the outlet of the BHE in our field fairly well. Hence, {{we assume that the}} obtained temperature profiles of the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>tubes</b> are realistic. In the first 10  m, the temperature gradient was lower than that in the other layers (thermal conductivity of layers two to six in W m− 1  K− 1 : 2.6, 2.83, 3.01, 2.87, and 2.92) due to the smaller thermal conductivity of 1.2  W m− 1  K− 1. At a depth of approximately 80 – 90  m, the EGRT (enhanced geothermal response test) provided unexpectedly high apparent thermal conductivities of 3.4  W m− 1  K− 1. As they exceed the values measured in samples from this depth range, we assume that groundwater flow has occurred in this region, which has contributed to the high apparent thermal conductivity by advective heat transport. Therefore, we used our first model to obtain the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>tube</b> temperatures at this depth range. Their difference was approximately 0.3  K at 80 – 90  m depth and decreased with increasing depth. We used the 0.3  K difference in the second model by assuming inlet and outlet temperatures of 7.0 and 7.3  °C, respectively. For the temperature of the surrounding soil at approximately 85  m depth, we assumed 10  °C. The temperature distribution for the underground was determined by a numerical model. In this model, we used a typical heat production rate of 0.6  W m− 2 on the bottom and the paleontological heat increased over the last 60  years (Mann et al. 2008) as the top boundary conditions, respectively.|$|R

Furthermore, the control model of variable condensation temperature target has been presented, and the heat transfer correction factor is introduced into the control model. And the control parameters in the model are determined by experiment. The control model is universal for FAPs with different capacities by identifying and choosing the heat transfer correction factor in the control program. For low temperature heating, the method of switching rotation speed of the motor can be adopted to enhance <b>air</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature to 22 degrees C.
