500|$|Against the Washington Senators on August 12, 1896, Lajoie {{made his}} major league debut. He played first base and {{recorded}} a single. Ed Delahanty was being considered {{to play the}} first base position after Dan Brouthers retired. Delahanty, however, wanted Lajoie to play first so he could return to his natural position of left field. Delahanty said to Lajoie, [...] "Look, sonny, you tell the boss you’re a first baseman <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me are gonna get along." [...] Lajoie became the team's first baseman {{and by the end}} of the season, he and Delahanty were roommates. Later in 1898, new manager George Stallings moved Lajoie to second base, commenting that [...] " [...] have made good no matter where I positioned him." ...|$|E

500|$|Through her work, Nevelson often {{explored}} {{the themes of}} her complicated past, factious present, and anticipated future. A common symbol that appears in Nevelson's work is the bride, as seen in Bride of the Black Moon (1955). The symbol of the bride referred to Nevelson's own escape from matrimony in her early life, and her own independence as a woman {{throughout the rest of}} her life. Her Sky Cathedral works often took years to create; Sky Cathedral: Night Wall, {{in the collection of the}} Columbus Museum of Art, took 13 years to build in her New York City studio. On the Sky Cathedral series, Nevelson commented: [...] "This is the Universe, the stars, the moon– <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I, everyone." ...|$|E
500|$|During production, Benson felt one {{recording}} {{session with}} Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf {{went beyond the}} ordinary {{to the point where}} he left the recording room and told Powell [...] "You have to go out there, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> her do this because you're coming to God right now in front of my eyes. You guys handle it". According to Benson, both he and Mosley were moved to tears by the session and Benson felt that something like that does not happen often in a recording studio. In a separate session with Mosley, bassist Tai Anderson said that, after recording the end of the song [...] "Run to You", Mosley said she could not believe she was recording with the band. Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration, Anderson said they told Mosley that she didn't have to do the recording. Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{disapprove of}} the terms [...] "conservative" [...] and [...] "liberal", or [...] "right, center, and left", when applied to judges because it may suggest that they are no different from legislators; but the private correspondence {{of members of the}} Court makes clear that they thought of themselves as ideological warriors. In the fall of 1929, Taft had written one of the Four Horsemen, Justice Butler, that his most fervent hope was for [...] "continued life of enough of the present membership... to prevent disastrous reversals of our present attitude. With Van [...] and Mac [...] and Sutherland <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Sanford, there will be five to steady the boat..." [...] Six counting Taft.|$|E
