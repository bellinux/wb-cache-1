25|$|Complex {{social network}} {{analysis}} is used to study the dynamics of large, complex social networks. Dynamic network analysis brings together traditional {{social network analysis}}, link analysis and multi-agent systems within network science and network theory. Through the use of key concepts and methods in social network analysis, agent-based modeling, theoretical physics, and modern mathematics (particularly graph theory and fractal geometry), this method of inquiry brought insights into the dynamics and structure of social systems. New computational methods of localized social network analysis <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the work of Duncan Watts, Albert-László Barabási, Nicholas A. Christakis, Kathleen Carley and others.|$|E
25|$|Villeneuve led {{the rest}} of his fleet into Cadiz on 21 August 1805, and the Sirius was sent to form part of the British fleet blockading them there. With Nelson's arrival to take command of the fleet, the main body was moved out to sea, with a chain of four frigates and four ships of the line {{established}} to observe the fleet in Cadiz and transmit signals about their movements to the British fleet. Sirius was the closest to the port and at first light on 19 October it was observed that the enemy were preparing to put to sea. Sirius immediately signalled the next frigate in the line, Henry Blackwood's , 'Enemy have their topsails hoisted'. Thus Prowse began the process that would lead to the interception of the combined fleet two days later. An hour later at 7 a.m. Sirius ran up three flags to signal code number 370, 'Enemy ships <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> port or getting under sail'. The signal was repeated down the line, reaching Nelson 48 miles away aboard HMS Victory at 9.30 a.m.|$|E

500|$|Parks and Recreation {{was rushed}} into {{production}} {{for the pilot}} to meet the April 9 premiere date. As a result, when the series was paneled at a January 2009 television critics press tour, NBC {{did not have a}} finished episode to air, and only had a copy of the pilot episode script available for critics to review. Some of the parts were not yet cast, and without a finalized title, the series was known only as The Untitled Amy Poehler Project or TUAPP. Alan Sepinwall, television writer for The Star-Ledger, said he found the script very funny even though he normally hates reading comedy scripts [...] "because they're rarely as funny on the page as they <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an actor's mouth".|$|E
500|$|In a {{cover story}} for Entertainment Weekly, Mars stated that the song [...] "Nothin' on You" [...] was {{rejected}} by a [...] "music industry decision-maker" [...] (a person he won't name) because of his race. That experience made him feel like a [...] "mutant", {{and he says that}} was his lowest point. [...] "Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like that <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> people's mouths. It made me feel like I wasn't even in the room." [...] In April 2013, in {{a cover story}} for GQ magazine, Mars confessed that he changed his surname because people in the music industry took him as another Latino artist, and even tried to convince him to sing in Spanish saying: [...] "Your last name's Hernandez, maybe you should do the Latin music, this Spanish music... Enrique [...] is so hot right now”. Nevertheless, Mars used his childhood nickname Bruno and changed his surname to Mars, in an effort to [...] "avoid being stereotyped".|$|E
500|$|When [...] "Nothin' on You" [...] {{was being}} showed to {{different}} [...] "music industry decision-makers", {{one of those}} individuals tried to give the song to a [...] "blue-eyed blonde" [...] artist instead of Mars, due to his race. That experience made the singer feel like a [...] "mutant", reaching his lowest point so far in his career. Mars concluded, [...] "Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like that <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> people's mouths. It {{made me feel like}} I wasn't even in the room." [...] According to American record producer Jim Jonsin, Atlantic Records' chairman, Craig Kallman, wanted him to work on the track for Lupe Fiasco. However, Jonsin pressured Kallman to give the song to B.o.B. Lupe stated that Kallman told him his lyrics and performance on the record were [...] "wack". Lupe claimed that this repeated denigration from the label drove him to a breaking point, and to feel [...] "suicidal". Afterwards, his verses were removed and new ones were written by Mars and B.o.B. An unmixed version of the song with Fiasco's verses and Mars' vocals leaked later in the same year.|$|E

Additional forces entered the nearby Palestinian town of Beit Lahiya. A Beit Lahiya resident was quoted in Ynetnews.com as saying, [...] "It's a crazy scene – everyone is shooting at everyone," [...] and [...] "Soldiers <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the trees, from the rooftops.

[...] Qiu {{and the other}} eunuchs also sent Shence Army soldiers to close all gates to the imperial city and enter various governmental offices to attack the officials. [...] It was said that the officials and their guards, and civilians who happened to be in the offices, were all slaughtered — over 1,000 people. [...] Various files, seals, books, and other equipment owned by the government were destroyed in the process. [...] The eunuchs also sent cavalry soldiers outside the imperial city to try to capture those who had fled.|$|E

60|$|NIGHTINGALE (Sylvia luscinia).--Every {{year about}} the 18th of April the notes may {{be heard by}} the gate of Cranbury, in a larch wood on Otterbourne Hill, in the copse wood of Otterbourne House, at Oakwood, and elsewhere. For about a week there is {{constant}} song, but after nesting begins, it is less frequent. One year there was a nest in the laurels at Otterbourne House (since taken away), and at eight {{in the morning and}} seven at night the nightingale came on the lawn to feed, and was every morning chased by a surly John Bull of a robin.

We are sorry to leave it; not that we {{have any idea of}} living in a cottage, as a comfortable thing; not that we prefer mud to marble, or deal to mahogany; but that, with it, we leave much of what is most beautiful of earth, the low and bee-inhabited scenery, which is full of quiet and prideless emotion, of such calmness as we can imagine prevailing over our earth when it was new in heaven. We are going into higher walks of architecture, where we shall find a less close connection established between the building and the soil on which it stands, or the air with which it is surrounded, but a closer connection with the character of its inhabitant. We shall have less to do with natural feeling, and more with human passion; we <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> stillness into turbulence, out of seclusion into the multitude, out of the wilderness into the world.|$|E

You have broken the shell of the old church, and here we are running about with nowhere to go. You have to make the shelter of a new church now for us, purged of errors, looking straight to God. The King of Mankind!--what a wonderful, wonderful phrase that is. It says everything. Tell us more of him and more.
