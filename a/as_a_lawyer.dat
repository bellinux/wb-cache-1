5|$|Cristina {{had not yet}} {{graduated}} {{when they}} moved to Río Gallegos, and completed the remaining subjects with distance education. There have been claims made that she never graduated, and {{that she may have}} worked <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> without having a degree. This idea was proposed by the constitutionalist Daniel Sabsay, and fueled by the reluctance of the National University of La Plata (UNLP) to release her degree. She registered at the Tribunal Superior de Justicia of Santa Cruz in 1980, the Comodoro Rivadavia's chamber of appeals in 1985, and worked as an attorney for the Justicialist Party in 1983. There are also logs of minor cases where she acted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer.</b> The claim has been sent to trial four times, and the judges Norberto Oyarbide, Ariel Lijo, Sergio Torres, and Claudio Bonadio all ruled that she has a degree.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer,</b> Sawyer {{focused on}} civil {{litigation}} in corporate law, {{at which he}} excelled.

In 1953, he was one of several defense attorneys in the case of United States v. Kuzma, a prosecution of Communist sympathizers under the Smith Act, which barred anyone from advocating for the overthrow of the American government. The defendants were found guilty, but their convictions were reversed in 1957 after the United States Supreme Court overturned the Smith Act in Yates v. United States.|$|E

5|$|Hastings {{eventually}} switched {{sides and}} joined the Labour Party. His conversion, especially {{in the light of}} later events, was regarded by some as suspect: his entry in the Dictionary of Labour Biography reports speculation that Hastings foresaw that Labour may come to Government and had few senior lawyers to fill the Law Officer posts. John Paton, after speaking from the same Independent Labour Party (ILP) platform as Hastings, {{came to the conclusion that}} Hastings gave political speeches using his skill <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> to master a brief; on the train home, Hastings appeared not to have heard of the ILP.|$|E

5|$|In 1295 he {{is found}} at the papal court acting as the commensalis ("table companion") and {{chaplain}} of Cardinal Hugh Aycelin (Hugh Seguin), the Dominican Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia. Hugh was probably making use of Dundee's training <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer.</b> At this time Thomas {{is said to be}} Dean of Brechin Cathedral. The last known dean, William, is attested in 1269, and another dean was in possession by 24 May 1275, but the name of this dean is not known. This person is probably not Thomas as it is unlikely that he was Dean of Brechin and Subdean of Glasgow at the same time.|$|E
5|$|In 1525 or 1526, Gérard {{withdrew his}} son from the Collège de Montaigu and {{enrolled}} {{him in the}} University of Orléans to study law.

Humanism was a European intellectual movement which stressed classical studies. During his 18-month stay in Bourges, Calvin learned Koine Greek, a necessity for studying the New Testament.|$|E
