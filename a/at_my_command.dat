500|$|Through {{the early}} hours of that Saturday, July 21, many from the 6th Regiment deserted, until only 11 were left, who were then {{incorporated}} into the ranks of the 5th. As Governor Carroll recalled: [...] "...the slender force <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>command</b> was incompetent to protect the city, or to carry a sense of security to those who had a right be secured..." [...] That morning, all business remained suspended. The bars in Baltimore remained closed, and a guard of soldiers and police protected workers as they set about the task of repairing the tracks and restoring the station to operating order. Toward nightfall, a battery of artillery was stationed at the depot.|$|E
500|$|However, {{this changed}} when James J. Kilpatrick, editor of The Richmond News Leader in Richmond, Virginia, quickly adopted a defiant and unyielding {{opposition}} to racial integration of public schools. Kilpatrick adopted the pre-American Civil War constitutional theory of interposition, and began publicly {{pushing for the}} state of Virginia to actively oppose the Supreme Court. Kilpatrick's hardening position, historian Joseph J. Thorndike has written, [...] "likely...helped stiffen the resolve of several key figures, especially Byrd." [...] On June 18, 1954, political leaders in Virginia's Southside (a collection of counties in the south-central region of the state) met and agreed to ask for vigorous state opposition to Brown. They began calling themselves the Defenders of State Sovereignty and Civil Liberties, and members included U.S. Congressmen William Munford Tuck and Watkins Abbitt as well as state senators Charles Moses and Garland Gray. They selected Farmville businessman Robert B. Crawford as their president. Stanley, himself from the Southside, was deeply influenced by the strong segregationist sentiments expressed at this meeting. Six days later, Governor Stanley announced he would [...] "use every legal means <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>command</b> to continue segregated schools in Virginia." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{strike and}} the {{subsequent}} Snow Riot in the District [...] exacerbated [...] long standing white fears of black workers on the navy yard. [...] In an undated diary entry for August 1835, African American diarist Michael Shiner confirms intimidation by white workers and their demand that the black caulkers stop work: [...] "Commodore Hull ishsared and evry one of them struck and said they wouldnt work anny moore {{and at the same}} time they were collered man from Baltimore by the name of Israel Jones a caulker by Trade he was the forman Caulker of those Colerded Caulkers and they where fifteen or twenty of them here at that time Caulkin on the Columbia and the Carpenters made all of them knock oft two." [...] As Michael Shiner wrote the white workers blamed Hull for bringing in black caulkers from Baltimore, Maryland and believed that black workers were to be used to break their strike. Hull's report to Dickerson shows the black caulkers did not strike. This and other incidents raised always simmering racial tension in the city and on the navy yard. White mechanics and laborers went on a three day rampage in which they threatened blacks and broke up their businesses and property. [...] On August 14, 1835, he wrote a letter to Dickerson, and expressed some apprehension for the safety of the black caulkers that he recently hired. [...] Rather than make a decision, Hull looked to the Secretary for a solution to his dilemma. [...] "Information has been conveyed to me that the Excitement which has prevailed in the City for some days past is about to be extended to the Neighborhood of the Establishment; the immediate Cause I understand is there are employed in the Yard a number of Blacks, who were in consequence of the Scarcity of Caulkers in this City brought in from Baltimore to caulk the Ship now building.Under the Circumstances I have to request that you will be pleased to give me instructions, Shall I let the Blacks inside the yard and afford them such protection as the force and means <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>Command</b> will allow or shall I discharge them and afford them an opportunity to return to Baltimore?" [...] As one historian has noted, Dickerson chose to throw the black caulkers to the mob as he promptly replied, “In answer to your letter of this date, I have to observe that for the present should think it not best to admit the colored people in the Navy Yard at night.” After days of disorder and riot, President Andrew Jackson ordered a company of US Marines to restore order.|$|E

Would he ever improve? My brother did not give much present hope of it, saying that on returning to winter quarters he had found the lad plunged all the deeper in dissipation for want of the check that my dear husband had been able to impose on him; but neither M. de Solivet nor the Marquis took it seriously, thinking it only what every youth in the army went through, unless he were such a wonderful exception as my dear Philippe had been.|$|R

60|$|To confess plainly, I had {{intended}} to spend my life (or any leisure I might have from Piracy upon the high seas) {{as the leader of}} a great horde of irregular cavalry, devastating whole valleys.

The road would be long. All roads are long that lead toward one's heart's desire.
