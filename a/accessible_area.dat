Case Western Reserve has dedicated a Michelson House to him, and Michelson Hall (an academic building of science classrooms, laboratories and offices) at the United States Naval Academy also bears his name. Clark University named a theatre after him. Michelson Laboratory at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in Ridgecrest, California is named for him. There is a display in the publicly <b>accessible</b> <b>area</b> of the Lab which includes facsimiles of Michelson's Nobel Prize medal, the prize document, and examples of his diffraction gratings.|$|E
25|$|Animal housing {{practical}} when collecting germplasms {{because they}} keep donor animals in an easily <b>accessible</b> <b>area,</b> making {{the process of}} collecting germplasms easier and more efficient. The species and breeds of animals housed should be considered while planning the facility; facilities should be big enough to meet animal welfare standards, yet small enough to reduce human contact and increase ease of handling while reducing stress of the animal. As the process of collecting germplasm may take several days, the animal may become stressed causing a lower quality of genetic material to be obtained. Thus, training the animal {{to become familiar with}} the process is key. Holding facilities for animals may also serve as a quarantine. Quarantine facilities are necessary in order to prevent the transmission of disease from animal to animal, animal to germplasm, germplasm to germplasm, and germplasm to animal. Introducing quarantine to separate the diseased animal(s) from the healthy should be done immediately. However, a quarantine does not always prevent the spread of disease.|$|E

40|$|This {{study on}} the use of Non Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) in the Nam Khan Watershed was {{conducted}} through household surveys and focus group discussions in three villages selected along a gradient of integration to market, and diversity of livelihood systems: Houayyen and Tinpha villages in Xieng Ngeun district and Longlet village in Phonxay district, Luang Prabang province. The main objectives of this research were to assess the value and uses of NTFPs by local farmers and to compare NTFPs management strategies between <b>accessible</b> and remote <b>areas.</b> This research revealed contrasted NTFPs management strategies between <b>accessible</b> <b>areas</b> and remote areas. More NTFPs species are collected in remote <b>areas</b> than in <b>accessible</b> <b>areas</b> but a bigger quantity is collected in <b>accessible</b> <b>areas.</b> In the remote areas, NTFPs are mainly consumed because of poor market accessibility, while most NTFPs collected in <b>accessible</b> <b>areas</b> are sold on the market. The diversity of NTFPs species available in the landscape influences local household management less than the possibility to get access to market. As a consequence, bigger volumes of a few species are collected in <b>accessible</b> <b>areas</b> for income generation while limited volume of more diverse species are collected in remote areas for food security. In remote areas, NTFPs are primarily collected in forests and old fallows while people in <b>accessible</b> <b>areas</b> have to collect NTFPs in young fallows that are individually appropriated and on agricultural land. Some commercial species (e. g. posaa, khem, peuakmeuak) are gradually domesticated as forest and old fallow patches get smaller, fragmented and scarce in the landscape. Sustainable management about NTFPs across the Nam Khan watershed should integrate conservation – development objectives at the watershed scale by increased exchanges between upstream and downstream villages and with the emerging markets. Sustainable NTFPs management plans should be designed not only at the village level but also at higher administrative levels (e. g. kumban, district, province, watershed) to tackle both environmental and livelihood issues. Protection of wildlife and biodiversity requires a better access to formal education in remote areas and environmental awareness in <b>accessible</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Accessible</b> surface <b>areas</b> is {{a measure}} of the solvent {{exposure}} of individual atoms or residues (measured in square Angstroms). It corresponds to the surface area of an atom (or residue) that a water molecule can access or touch. In VADAR, the <b>accessible</b> surface <b>areas</b> (ASA) for each residue is presented under two different column headers: RES ASA (residue ASA) and FRAC ASA (fractional ASA). The data listed under the RES ASA column refers to the “residue accessible surface areas” as measured in square Angstroms. The data listed under the FRAC ASA column refers to the fractional residue <b>accessible</b> surface <b>areas</b> (a value ranging from 0 to 1.0). Exposed, exterior, random coil or hydrophilic residues typically have a large fractional <b>accessible</b> surface <b>areas</b> (>0.5), while hydrophobic, beta sheet or interior residues have a small fractional <b>accessible</b> surface <b>areas</b> (<0.2). The fractional <b>accessible</b> surface <b>areas</b> is calculated by dividing a given residue’s observed <b>accessible</b> surface <b>areas</b> by the calculated <b>accessible</b> surface <b>areas</b> for that residue in an extended Gly-Xaa-Gly tripeptide (where Xaa is the residue of interest). VADAR reports accessible surface are values both for the entire amino acid residue and for the amino acid side chains. The <b>accessible</b> surface <b>areas</b> is also calculated for charged atoms (N, O), polar (N, O, S) atoms and for non-polar atoms (C). This information can be used to calculate charged, polar and non-polar surface <b>area.</b> <b>Accessible</b> surface <b>areas</b> measurements/estimates are particularly useful in protein structure assessment, protein structure validation and thermodynamic calculations. The values calculated for <b>accessible</b> surface <b>areas</b> (ASA) depend critically on the selection or choice of atomic or Van der Waals radii. Different methods and different authors have advocated the use of different atomic radii. As a result, VADAR provides several choices for atomic or Van der Waals radii.|$|R

40|$|The {{fight for}} space between city administrators and street vendors working in city centers {{is one of}} the major controversies about street commerce. Trying to renew and upgrade their downtowns, city administrators of most urban areas have {{attempted}} to relocate street vendors from central areas to peripheries, from the streets to indoor public markets. That attempt has almost always found fierce opposition among street vendors, who claim that entering into contact with the greatest number of pedestrians is the key to successful street vending. Most scholars studying street vendors have not questioned such a proposition; on the contrary, they have somehow taken it for granted. Yet, a comparison of four street vendor groups [...] two located in the most <b>accessible</b> <b>areas</b> and two in less <b>accessible</b> <b>areas</b> of downtown Mexico City [...] revels that street vendors with a more limited access to customers can obtained better working conditions and economic results than others who are located in most <b>accessible</b> <b>areas.</b> The following factors explain the better results of the street vendors located in the less <b>accessible</b> <b>areas</b> of downtown Mexico City. First, street vendors located in the less <b>accessible</b> <b>areas</b> have easier access to storage space, more room for large stalls and are less likely to have their goods confiscated by the police. (cont.) These advantages provide them the possibility to increase the scale of their commerce. Second, the possibility to increase the scale of their commerce and their limited competition for space function as an incentive to expand their network of suppliers to low-cost intermediaries [...] in this specific case with intermediaries involved in smuggling [...] and to develop street vendor organizations that support their product specialization. Having very low prices and working in specialized street markets, the street vendors located in the less <b>accessible</b> <b>areas</b> of downtown Mexico City attract customers despite their location. In contrast, the street vendors located in the most <b>accessible</b> <b>areas</b> because of their small-scale type of commerce and because they are located in areas where street vending is officially banned but unofficially tolerated they got involved in a competition for space that constrains their profits and lead the street vendors to augment their number to gain political baking. If the city government will not support street vendors located in the most <b>accessible</b> <b>areas</b> [...] in particular, if it will not act to regulate competition for space of these street vendor groups [...] street trading of smuggled products will remain the best alternative for Mexico City street vendors. by Bruno Nazim Baroni.

40|$|Objective: To compare {{rates of}} {{self-reported}} use {{of health services}} between rural, remote and urban South Australians. Methods: Secondary data analysis from a population-based survey to assess health and well-being, conducted in South Australia in 2000. In all, 2, 454 adults were randomly selected and interviewed using the computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) system. We analysed health service use by Accessibility and Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA) category. Results: There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in the median number of uses of the four types of health services studied across ARIA categories. Significantly fewer residents of highly <b>accessible</b> <b>areas</b> reported never using primary care services (14. 4 % vs. 22. 2 % in very remote areas), and significantly more reported high use (≥ 6 visits, 29. 3 % vs. 21. 5 %). Fewer residents of remote areas reported never attending hospital (65. 6 % vs. 73. 8 % in highly <b>accessible</b> <b>areas).</b> Frequency of use of mental health services was not statistically significantly different across ARIA categories. Very remote residents were more likely to spend at least one night in a public hospital (15. 8 %) than were residents of other areas (e. g. 5. 9 % for highly <b>accessible</b> <b>areas).</b> Conclusion: The self-reported frequency of use of a range of health services in South Australia was broadly similar across ARIA categories. However, use of primary care services was higher among residents of highly <b>accessible</b> <b>areas</b> and public hospital use increased with increasing remoteness.
