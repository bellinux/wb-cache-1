5|$|After the Finance Committee vote on October 15, {{negotiations}} {{turned to}} moderate Democrats. Majority leader Harry Reid focused on satisfying centrists. The holdouts {{came down to}} Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who caucused with Democrats, and conservative Nebraska Democrat Ben Nelson. Lieberman's demand that the bill not include <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> was met, although supporters won various concessions, including allowing state-based public options such as Vermont's Green Mountain Care.|$|E
25|$|Hamsher {{is known}} as a strong {{advocate}} for a public health insurance option. In June 2009, she challenged the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) to pledge to vote against any health care reform bill that lacked <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>option.</b> Some of these pledges were videotaped. The CPC released their own letter shortly thereafter signed by 60 members, although the letter was vague as to whether it applied to the conference report. Ultimately none of the CPC members honored their pledge. Hamsher {{was one of the few}} liberals who opposed the bill until the end. She co-founded a non-profit organization, Public Option Please, to continue the fight for <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> and more generally for universal health care.|$|E
25|$|The {{threat of}} <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>option,</b> i.e. direct {{government}} provision {{of goods and}} services in a sector that is deemed under-serviced, can be a powerful motivator for private companies to modify their behaviour in order to prevent the government from entering their market.|$|E

25|$|A {{statistical}} analysis {{of the impact of}} political contributions on individual senators' support for the <b>public</b> insurance <b>option</b> conducted by Nate Silver has suggested that Baucus was an unlikely supporter of the <b>public</b> <b>option</b> in the first place. Based on Baucus's political ideology and the per capita health care spending in Montana, Silver's model projects that there would be only a 30.6% probability of Baucus supporting <b>a</b> <b>public</b> insurance <b>option</b> even if he had received no relevant campaign contributions. Silver calculates that the impact on Baucus of the significant campaign contributions that he has received from the health care industry further reduces the probability of his supporting <b>a</b> <b>public</b> insurance <b>option</b> from 30.6% to 0.6%.|$|R

25|$|Although his {{voting record}} {{is not always}} in line {{with that of the}} Democratic Party, on March 17, 2010, after being courted by President Barack Obama, his wife and others, he reluctantly agreed to vote with his colleagues for the Healthcare Bill without <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> component.|$|E
25|$|Lessig {{supports}} the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act {{and believes that}} it brings us closer to giving Americans a sense of financial security. Although he voices strong support, he also believes that legislation should be passed that adds <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> to the insurance mandate and repeals the ban on the government negotiating for lower drug prices. Lessig has proposed prize funding drug research and banning drug companies from negotiating with generic drug providers to delay entry into the market.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, The Stranger ran {{an article}} on Cantwell's {{opposition}} to the inclusion of <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> in the health-care reform plan. They reported that: “Seattle congressman Jim McDermott supports it. Washington senator Patty Murray wants it. So does President Barack Obama. So does the often conservative Seattle Times editorial page. So do 72 percent of Americans, {{according to a recent}} poll. So what's going on with Washington's junior senator, Maria Cantwell? Why doesn't she want Congress to include a public option—a new government-run health-care plan that will be available to everyone and will compete with private insurance companies to bring down costs—in its health-care-reform package?” Cantwell cited her concerns with getting the bill through the United States Senate as the reason for her opposition.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{believes}} {{health care}} is a human right. He voted for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, ultimately pushing for <b>a</b> robust <b>public</b> <b>option</b> which wasn't included in the final measure.|$|R

50|$|Some {{opponents of}} net {{neutrality}} argue {{that under the}} ISP market competition, paid-prioritization of bandwidth can induce optimal user welfare. Although net neutrality might protect user welfare when the market lacks competition, they argue that a better alternative could be to introduce <b>a</b> neutral <b>public</b> <b>option</b> to incentivize competition, rather than enforcing existing ISPs to be neutral.|$|R
25|$|The Affordable Care Act faced {{considerable}} {{challenges and}} opposition after its passage, and Republicans continually attempted {{to repeal the}} law. The law also survived two major challenges {{that went to the}} Supreme Court. In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, a 5-4 majority upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, though it made state Medicaid expansion voluntary. In King v. Burwell, a 6-3 majority allowed the use of tax credits in state-operated exchanges. The October 2013 launch of HealthCare.gov, a health insurance exchange website created under the provisions of the ACA, was widely criticized, though many of the problems were fixed {{by the end of the}} year. The number of uninsured Americans dropped from 20.2% of the population in 2010 to 13.3% of the population in 2015, though Republicans continued to oppose Obamacare as an unwelcome expansion of government. Many liberals continued to push for a single-payer healthcare system or <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>option,</b> and Obama endorsed the latter proposal, as well as an expansion of health insurance tax credits, in 2016.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2013, Representative Jan Schakowsky and 44 other U.S. House of Representatives Democrats {{introduced}} , the [...] "Public Option Deficit Reduction Act" [...] {{which would}} amend the 2010 Affordable Care Act to create <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>option.</b> The bill {{would set up}} a government-run health insurance plan with premiums 5% to 7% percent lower than private insurance. The Congressional Budget Office estimated it would reduce the United States public debt by $104 billion over 10 years.|$|E
2500|$|On health care, the {{platform}} committee adopted a provision supporting <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> for the Affordable Care Act and for legislation to allow Americans ages 55 {{and over to}} buy into Medicare.

50|$|Carson is {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of health care reform legislation that increases access to medical care for millions of uninsured Americans and provides a more stable system for those at risk of losing their health insurance.

2500|$|In a June 2009 NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey, 76% said it {{was either}} [...] "extremely" [...] or [...] "quite" [...] {{important}} to [...] "give people a choice of both a public plan administered {{by the federal government}} and a private plan for their health insurance." [...] A July survey by Rasmussen Reports found 50% of Americans opposed the idea of <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> and 35% expressed support. An August 2009 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found 47% of Americans opposed and 43% expressing support. CNN Polling Director Keating Holland has stated that partisan affiliations drive people's opinions on the issue.|$|E
2500|$|However, in 2014 Harkin {{expressed}} some second thoughts. He criticized {{health reform}} {{as being too}} complex and convoluted. “All the prevention stuff is good but it’s just really complicated. It doesn’t {{have to be that}} complicated,” he said of the Affordable Care Act. He also believes the new legislation rewards the insurance industry. [...] He said important reforms such as preventing insurance companies from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions and keeping young adults on their parents’ health insurance plans until age 26 were laudable, but he now believes that Democrats should not have settled for a solution he believes is inferior to government-provided health insurance. In retrospect he believes the Democratic-controlled Senate and House should have enacted a single-payer healthcare system or <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> to give the uninsured access to government-run health plans that compete with private insurance companies.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, the PCCC began a {{campaign}} for <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> in the Affordable Care Act.

25|$|In May 2010, while {{favoring the}} {{filibuster}} {{and threatening to}} use it in 2009 to eliminate <b>a</b> <b>public</b> health <b>option</b> as part of the healthcare proposal, Lieberman once strongly opposed the filibuster. In 1995, he joined with Senator Tom Harkin to co-sponsor an amendment to kill the filibuster. “The filibuster hurts the credibility of the entire Senate and impedes progress,” Lieberman told the Hartford Courant (January 6, 1995).|$|R

50|$|HCAN did {{not achieve}} {{one of its}} central goals, the {{creation}} of <b>a</b> so-called <b>public</b> <b>option,</b> <b>a</b> government-run health plan that would introduce greater competition into local health insurance markets, nearly {{all of which are}} dominated by one or two large companies. Republicans joined with conservative Democrats to block the <b>public</b> <b>option</b> and <b>a</b> proposal to allow Americans over 55 years old to pay unsubsidized premiums to the government to purchase Medicare benefits, which now are provided to the elderly and disabled through a single-payer system that picks up the vast majority of patients' costs.

50|$|In 2009, the Congressional Progressive Caucus {{outlined}} five key healthcare principles {{they intended}} to pass into law. The CPC mandated <b>a</b> nationwide <b>public</b> <b>option,</b> affordable health insurance, insurance market regulations, an employer insurance provision mandate, and comprehensive services for children. In March 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was intended to increase the affordability and efficiency of the United States healthcare system. Although considered a success by progressives, many argued that it didn't go far enough in achieving healthcare reform, as exemplified with the Democrats' failure in achieving <b>a</b> national <b>public</b> <b>option.</b> In recent decades, Single-payer healthcare has become an important goal in healthcare reform for progressives. In the 2016 Democratic Primary, progressive Democratic Socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders {{raised the issue of}} a single-payer healthcare system, citing his belief that millions of Americans are still paying too much for health insurance, and arguing that millions more don't receive the care they need. In 2016, an effort was made to implement a single-payer healthcare system in the state of Colorado, known as ColoradoCare (Amendment 69). Senator Bernie Sanders held rallies in Colorado in support of the Amendment leading up to the vote. Despite high-profile support, Amendment 69 failed to pass, with just 21.23% of voting Colorado residents voting in favor, and 78.77% against.|$|R
