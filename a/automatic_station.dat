Plans for a fixed link were launched in 1963, originally based on two bridges which would connect to Håøya. Plans resurfaced in the early 1980s {{with the advent of}} subsea tunneling technology and the Oslo Airport location controversy, which proposed airports in Hurum, Ås and Hobøl. Even though Gardermoen was ultimately build as the airport, the tunnel had raised sufficient support to be built irrespectively. Parliament gave approval on 13 December 1996 and construction started on 14 April 1997. The tunnel was official opened on 29 June 2000 and was financed in part by a toll, collected by Bompengeselskapet Oslofjordtunnelen at a toll plaza in Frogn. In 2014, the manual toll station was replaced by an <b>automatic</b> <b>station.</b> Since 30 August 2016, it is free to pass through the tunnel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Automatic</b> {{meteorological}} <b>station</b> {{is important}} for meteorological observation {{and the existence of}} outliers in the observational data is inevitable. The paper proposes outlier detection for observational data of <b>automatic</b> meteorological <b>station</b> based on least square support vector machine (LS-SVM). The method establishes the LS-SVM model for the meteorological factor and uses the model to evaluate the observational data. If the observational data deviate from the model, they would be seemed as outliers. The ground temperature data observed by two real <b>automatic</b> meteorological <b>stations</b> are used in experiments. Experiments results verify that the proposed method realize outlier detection for observational data of <b>automatic</b> meteorological <b>station</b> effectively and ensures subsequent process and analysis of the meteorological data...|$|R

During this time the fleet has undergone numerous technological and reliability upgrades, starting with the introduction of Automatic Train Control in 1976 (with subsequent revisions of hardware and software), major refurbishments of the MR-63 coaches by GEC Alsthom at Pointe St. Charles workshops in 1993, solid-state door interlocks in 2003, modern ergonomic driver cabs with new digital dashboards, and <b>automatic</b> <b>station</b> announcements in 2005 (voiced by Michèle Deslauriers).|$|E
50|$|Techniques {{used in the}} ALE {{standard}} include automatic signaling, <b>automatic</b> <b>station</b> identification (sounding), polling, message store-and-forward, linking {{protection and}} anti-spoofing to prevent hostile denial of service by ending the channel scanning process. Optional ALE functions include polling and the exchange of orderwire commands and messages. The orderwire message, known as AMD (Automatic Message Display), is {{the most commonly used}} text transfer method of ALE, and the only universal method that all ALE controllers have in common for displaying text. It is common for vendors to offer extensions to AMD for various non-standard features, although dependency on these extensions undermines interoperability. As in all interoperability scenarios, care should be taken to determine if this is acceptable before using such extensions.|$|E

50|$|PATCO {{was one of}} {{the first}} transit systems to {{incorporate}} Automatic train operation for regular service. The PATCO ATO is an analogue system that makes use of pulse code cab signaling supplied by Union Switch and Signal. The cab signals supply one of five different speeds (20 mph, 30 mph, 40 mph, 65 mph and 0 mph) and the on-board ATO gear will supply maximum acceleration or maximum braking force to reach that target speed. The frequent use of such high acceleration and deceleration rates makes for a quick ride, yet one that can occasionally be perilous for non-seated passengers. <b>Automatic</b> <b>station</b> stops are handled by track mounted transponders and can be overridden by the operator for non-stopping trains.|$|E
5000|$|An ocean swell from Dora {{produced}} 8 - 20 foot (2 - 6 m) waves {{along the}} east and southern shores of the island of Hawaii. This prompted local officials to close all beaches, campsites and nature trails in the Puna and Kau districts due to the deteriorating conditions. The outer rainbands produced winds of up to 60 mph (95 km/h) at some high elevations, and also resulted in some light rainfall. Hurricane Dora also produced rough surf on Johnston Island, with one forecaster remarking the surf was the most severe aspect of the storm. The <b>automatic</b> <b>station</b> at Johnston Atoll reported wind gusts between 40 [...] - [...] 45 mph (75 - 85 km/h) for two hours.

5000|$|The Oslofjord Tunnel (Oslofjordtunnelen) is a subsea {{road tunnel}} which {{traverses}} the Oslofjord, connecting Hurum and Frogn in Norway. Carrying three lanes National Road 23, the 7306 m long tunnel reaches {{a depth of}} 134 m below mean sea level. The tunnel has a maximum gradient of seven percent. It acts as the main link connecting Buskerud with Follo and Østfold, supplementing the Moss-Horten Ferry which runs further south. The crossing was originally served by the Drøbak-Storsand Ferry, which commenced in 1939. Plans for a fixed link were launched in 1963, originally based on two bridges which would connect to Håøya.

The tunnel was flooded in 2003 and 2008 and experienced a landslide in 2003. All of these incidents resulted in the tunnel being closed for weeks. There have been two major truck fires, one in 2006 and one in 2011. After the latter incident, the tunnel has been closed for heavy traffic exceeding 7.5 tonnes. In an effort to eliminate the problem, the Public Roads Administration has proposed building a second tube.|$|E
