500|$|Holby City premiered on 12 January 1999 on BBC One. Fourteen {{series of}} the show have since aired, and a fifteenth began airing on 16 October 2012. The show's first series ran for nine episodes. In June 2000, then Director-General of the BBC Greg Dyke pledged extra funding for BBC One, some of which was used for extra episodes of Holby City. The second and third series ran for 16 and 30 episodes respectively, with new episodes then airing {{on a weekly basis}} from the fourth series onwards. Series four to nine and eleven all ran for 52 episodes, while series ten ran for 53 episodes, {{including}} the stand-alone finale episode [...] "Mad World", set outside the hospital. All series from then on continued to consist of 52 episodes, with exception to the twelfth series, which consisted of 55 episodes in total. Young explained of the increase in series length: [...] "Longer runs allow you to develop really strong storylines for the regular characters. <b>As</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> volume with passion, it'll work." [...] The series reached its 500th episode on 13 April 2010.|$|E

Then, kissing the baby three times, she mounted her coach and drove away.|$|E

[...] "Why, you seem quite frightened, love," [...] he added, taking her hand with his easy, graceful air; [...] "frightened, let me assure you, without the least cause. My mother has but that one prejudice, and that one weak point, Rose. You will find her a very dove for gentleness, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not wound her pride of caste.

There is the governor, the intendant, perhaps, one or two priests, three or four officers, but {{how many of the}} noblesse? Scarcely one. They buy their titles over here as they buy their pelts, and it is better to have a canoe-load of beaver skins than a pedigree from Roland. But I forget my duties. You are weary and hungry, you and your friends. Come up with me to the tapestried salon, and we shall see if my stewards can find anything for your refreshment. You play piquet, if I remember right? Ah, my skill is leaving me, and I should be glad to try a hand with you." ...|$|E

There is no sort of wrong deed {{of which}} a man can bear the {{punishment}} alone; you can't isolate yourself {{and say that the}} evil which is in you shall not spread. Men's lives are as thoroughly blended with each other as the air they breathe: evil spreads as necessarily as disease. I know, I feel the terrible extent of suffering this sin of Arthur's has caused to others; but so does every sin cause suffering to others besides those who commit it. An act of vengeance on your part against Arthur would simply be another evil added to those we are suffering under: you could not bear the punishment alone; you would entail the worst sorrows on every one who loves you. You would have committed an act of blind fury that would leave all the present evils just as they were and add worse evils to them. You may tell me that you meditate no fatal act of vengeance, but the feeling in your mind is what gives birth to such actions, and as long as you indulge it, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not see that to fix your mind on Arthur's punishment is revenge, and not justice, you are in danger of being led on to the commission of some great wrong. Remember what you told me about your feelings after you had given that blow to Arthur in the Grove." ...|$|E

6000|$|After a short period, Lady Roehampton saw Adriana, and {{not very}} long after, Lady Montfort. They both of them, from that time, were her frequent, if not constant, companions, but she saw no one else. Once only, since the terrible event, was she seen by the world, {{and that was when}} a tall figure, {{shrouded}} in the darkest attire, attended as chief mourner at the burial of her lord in Westminster Abbey. She remained permanently in London, not only because she had no country house, but because she wished to be with her brother. As time advanced, she frequently saw Mr. Sidney Wilton, who, being chief executor of the will, and charged with all her affairs, had necessarily much on which to consult her. One of the greatest difficulties was to provide her with a suitable residence, for of course, she was not to remain in the family mansion in St. James' Square. That difficulty was ultimately overcome in a manner highly interesting to her feelings. Her father's mansion in Hill Street, where she had passed her prosperous and gorgeous childhood, was in the market, and she was most desirous to occupy it. [...] "It will seem like a great step towards the restoration," [...] she said to Endymion. [...] "My plans are, that you should give up the Albany, and that we should live together. I should like to live together in Hill Street; I should like to see our nursery once more. The past then will be a dream, or at least all the past that is disagreeable. My fortune is yours; as we are twins, it is likely that I may live <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> But I wish you to be the master of the house, and in time receive your friends in a manner becoming your position. I do not think that I shall ever much care to go out again, but I may help you at home, and then you can invite women; a mere bachelor's house is always dull." ...|$|E
