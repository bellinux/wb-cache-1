25|$|In October 1858, {{experimental}} firing {{trials were}} undertaken against the Meteor {{and one of}} the follow-on class of iron-hulled <b>armoured</b> <b>batteries,</b> the Erebus. These demonstrated the importance of wooden backing for the armour, as the Meteor put up far better resistance than Erebus, where the frames were displaced by concussion.|$|R

50|$|When {{the ship}} was {{refitted}} in 1881-85, she became the only British ironclad to have her entire muzzle-loading armament replaced by breech-loaders. Bellerophon received ten BL Mk III guns, mounted in the central battery and four 6-inch (152 mm) guns as chase guns fore and aft. The forward guns were mounted in new embrasures in the forecastle on the upper deck as the original guns were too low and were usually washed out in a head sea. Eight 4-inch breech-loading guns as well as four quick-firing 6-pounder Hotchkiss and 12 machine guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. The ship also received two 16 in Whitehead torpedo launchers that were carried on the main deck, outside the <b>armoured</b> <b>battery.</b> The new eight-inch guns were some 7 ft longer than the original nine-inch guns and the central battery proved to be too small for effective use of the guns.|$|E

2500|$|Napoleon wanted ten {{floating}} batteries {{built in}} time for the 1855 campaign, but as French industry could only build five in time, France's British allies were asked to build the other five. [...] Unfortunately the First Lord, Sir James Graham, confused this concept with the unsuccessful iron-hulled frigates built in the late 1840s, and asked for further trials, so the British <b>armoured</b> <b>batteries</b> were not ordered until 4 October 1854.|$|R

2500|$|Britain and France each {{laid down}} {{five of these}} coastal attack vessels in 1854. The French used three of their {{batteries}} in 1855 against the defences at Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences.

[...] The development of such iron-armoured batteries was a step towards the development of ironclad warships.

50|$|The next {{objective}} {{along the}} Euphrates was {{the town of}} Khan al Baghdadi. Most battles in Mesopotamia had been tied to the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. If an attack was successful, the loser would withdraw {{along the line of}} the river to prepared positions further back. Securing a proper victory was difficult. In an attempt to break with the usual pattern, the 15th Indian Division were supplied with 300 Ford lorries, the 8th Light <b>Armoured</b> Motor <b>Battery</b> (<b>armoured</b> cars), and the 11th Cavalry Brigade. A mobile blocking force was assembled using divisional infantry in the lorries, the armoured cars, the cavalry brigade, and one of the divisional artillery batteries equipped with double the usual number of horses.|$|R
