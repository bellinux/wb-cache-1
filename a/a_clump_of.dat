5|$|These ants live in nests {{in sandy}} soil which {{sometimes}} have a mound, which resembles a molehill. M. nigrocincta ants labor to conceal their nests using twigs and leaves. Depending {{on the type}} of habitat in which the colony is located, they decorate the nest with plant material and gravel. Other materials that are used to camouflage M. nigrocincta colonies include dry leaves, rocks, vegetation, and twigs. Nests are beside <b>a</b> <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> grass or bush or {{at the base of a}} tree.|$|E
5|$|A {{few seconds}} after Pajota {{and his men}} heard Murphy fire the first shot, they fired on the alerted Japanese {{contingent}} situated across the Cabu River. Pajota had earlier sent a demolitions expert to set charges on the unguarded bridge to go off at 19:45. The bomb detonated at the designated time, and although it did not destroy the bridge, it formed a large hole over which tanks and other vehicles could not pass. Waves of Japanese troops rushed the bridge, but the V-shaped choke point created by the Filipino guerrillas repulsed each attack. Oneguerrilla, who had been trained to use the bazooka {{only a few hours}} earlier by the Rangers, destroyed or disabled four tanks that were hiding behind <b>a</b> <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> trees. A group of Japanese soldiers made an effort to flank the ambush position by crossing the river away from the bridge, but the guerrillas spotted and eliminated them.|$|E
5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or <b>a</b> <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E

5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} {{appears on the}} {{shoulder}} of the dying Cú Chulainn, and could also be a manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then <b>a</b> <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E
5|$|The Danger Tree {{had been}} part of <b>a</b> <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> trees located about halfway into No Man's Land and had {{originally}} been used as a landmark by a Newfoundland Regiment trench raiding party {{in the days before the}} Battle of the Somme. British and German artillery bombardments eventually stripped the tree of leaves and left nothing more than a shattered tree trunk. During the Newfoundland Regiment's infantry assault, the tree was once again used as a landmark, where the troops were ordered to gather. The tree was however a highly visible landmark for the German artillery and the site proved to be a location where the German shrapnel was particularly deadly. As a result, the regiment suffered a large concentration of casualties around the tree. A replica representation of the twisted tree now stands at the spot.|$|E
5|$|The present town {{originates}} from {{an original}} settlement established in 893 AD by inhabitants escaping a Danish Viking raid, who were granted land by a Saxon Lord for their resistance. The {{name comes from}} the Old English æscet, indicating a ford near <b>a</b> <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> ash trees. At {{the time of the}} Domesday Book of 1086 it was still known by its original Saxon name of Essetesford (or Eshetisford, Esselesford, Asshatisforde, Essheford). The manor was owned by Hugh de Montford, Constable of England, and had a church, two mills and a value of 150 shillings (£7.50) at the time. One of the earliest houses in the area still in existence is Lake House at Eastwell Park {{to the north of the}} town, which contains the grave of Richard Plantagenet.|$|E

5|$|Hartlaub {{considered}} the chestnut sparrow's colouration and morphology to be distinct enough to allocate {{it to its}} own monotypic genus, Sorella. Although a few authors have followed Hartlaub's treatment, it is usually placed in the genus Passer. It {{is very similar to}} the two golden sparrows, from which it may have once been only clinally different. The male Arabian golden sparrow is almost entirely gold-coloured, the male chestnut sparrow is mostly chestnut, and the male Sudan golden sparrow is intermediate between the two. British ornithologist Richard Meinertzhagen {{considered the}}se three species to be conspecific; however, the range of the Sudan golden sparrow overlaps with that of the chestnut sparrow without any known interbreeding in a small area of Sudan. These species are similar in their behaviour, which is adapted to the unpredictable conditions of their arid habitat. In particular, they and the Dead Sea sparrow share a courtship display in which males quiver their wings above their body. This intense display is probably an adaptation to nesting in <b>a</b> <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> trees surrounded by similar habitat, where such an intense display may serve important purposes in keeping a colony together.|$|E
5|$|The frogs {{may move}} up to 100m during amplexus before the female lays her eggs. During the laying of the eggs, the pair of frogs remain in amplexus and the male is assumed to {{fertilise}} the eggs with his sperm. Males are also seen to paddle their rear legs during this time, which is speculated to accelerate fertilisation. The egg-laying and fertilisation process takes around five minutes. An average of 5,000 eggs are deposited amongst aquatic vegetation in a gelatinous mass; however, <b>a</b> <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> 11,682 has been recorded. The female moves around while depositing, {{leaving a trail of}} eggs that sometimes entangles upon itself. Initially, the mass floats, but sinks up to 12 hours after laying, or when disturbed. The eggs are distinct from those of other frog species; they are 2–2.5mm wide upon deposition and are bicoloured, black at one end and white at the other. They immediately begin to expand, quickly reaching around 4mm across, before sinking. When first laid, they float with the black pointing up, but after sinking, the orientation becomes disordered. Two to five days later, the tadpoles hatch out, but the process can take only a few hours on occasions. The hatching rate varies between 46 and 77%, and peaks at 22°C. Hatching is less likely in acidic waters, although alkaline conditions do not lead to a lower rate compared to neutral conditions. Given the large number of eggs that hatch per female and given the scarcity of mature frogs, tadpole survival rates are believed to be very low.|$|E

25|$|Today's {{commercial}} {{variety of}} the common mushroom originally was a light brown color.

Similar to the commercial development history of the navel orange and Red Delicious apple, cultures were grown from the mutant individuals, and most of the cream-colored store mushrooms marketed today are products of this 1926 chance natural mutation.|$|E
25|$|The females {{build the}} nest {{which is a}} {{cup-shaped}} depression in the ground. The nest is lined with pieces of lichen, leaves and moss which can occur naturally or can be added by the female. The nests are generally well hidden in <b>a</b> <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> moss or grass. Males defend the breeding territory by gliding and fluttering above it while making oinking and rattling sounds. When on the ground, the male stretches its wing {{out to the side}} and raises its tail into the air to display the white patch on its rump. He then walks and runs while repeating a call.|$|E

No flowering specimen was seen during these visits; indeed, no-one knew what the flower looked like until 2006. In March of that year, storms associated with Cyclone Glenda dumped a year's worth of rain {{in the area in}} a single day, and shortly afterwards, flowers began to form.

25|$|Numerous Danish folktales {{contain a}} range of mythical figures such as trolls, elves, goblins and wights as well as figures from Nordic mythology like giants and lygtemænd (hobby lanterns). The nisse is a {{particularly}} well known legendary figure in Danish folklore, apparently dating back to pre-Christian times when it was believed there were household gods. Traditionally each farm had its own nisse living on the loft or in a stable. Dressed in grey with a pointed red cap, he was no taller than a 10-year-old boy. The nisse would be helpful if treated well, for instance by offering him a bowl of porridge with <b>a</b> <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> butter at night, but, failing good treatment, he could become quite troublesome and mean.|$|E
25|$|In Japanese culture, the boar {{is widely}} seen as a fearsome and {{reckless}} animal, {{to the point that}} several words and expressions in Japanese referring to recklessness include references to boars. The boar is the last animal of the oriental zodiac, with people born during the year of the Pig being said to embody the boar-like traits of determination and impetuosity. Among Japanese hunters, the boar's courage and defiance is a source of admiration, and {{it is not uncommon for}} hunters and mountain people to name their sons after the animal inoshishi (猪). Boars are also seen as symbols of fertility and prosperity; in some regions, it is thought that boars are drawn to fields owned by families including pregnant women, and hunters with pregnant wives are thought to have greater chances of success when boarhunting. The animal's link to prosperity was illustrated by its inclusion on the ¥10 note during the Meiji period, and it was once believed that a man could become wealthy by keeping <b>a</b> <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> boar hair in his wallet.|$|E
