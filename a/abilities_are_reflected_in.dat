Our study indicates that people having higher hand strength also have greater control in hand movement and can perform pointing faster. This result also holds true independently of motor-skills.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on an {{apparently}} secondary aspect of Adorno???s argumentation in the Positivist Debate: social physiognomy. Physiognomy forms {{part of what the}} historian Carlo Ginzburg called an ???evidential paradigm???. Based specifically on semiotics, it began to assert itself in the human sciences in the late nineteenth century. The art connoisseur Giovanni Morelli, Sherlock Holmes and Sigmund Freud showed how through its application, information considered marginal could enable understanding a deeper, otherwise unattainable reality. Benjamin and Adorno also set physiognomy at the centre of their complex, anti-reductionist theory of culture, which focuses on aspects neglected by conventional approaches. While traditional ???rationalistic??? historical and sociological approaches generally focus on overt aspects of ???culture???, such as language or words, physiognomy seeks more far-reaching significance through the conviction that mental <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> the corporeal nature of human beings. Physiognomy thus considers those aspects of culture that are neither rational nor logical and not explicitly revealed. For this reason, physiognomic practice generally focuses on analysing myths, dream states, and covert aspects of the mind and body ??? cultural expressions that are not produced by the conscious, logical mind, but are involuntary and repressed. Today, {{more than half a century}} after the Positivist Debate, the topicality of Adorno???s sociological thinking can be seen to lie more in his efforts to unify abstract theorising, object, and aesthetic representation, than in his explanatory analysis of capitalist society...|$|E

5000|$|The {{correlation}} between pKaH and leaving group <b>ability,</b> however, <b>is</b> not perfect. Leaving group ability represents {{the difference in}} energy between starting materials and a transition state (ΔG‡), and differences <b>in</b> leaving group <b>ability</b> <b>are</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> changes in this quantity (ΔΔG‡). The quantity pKaH, however, represents the difference in energy between starting materials and products (ΔG) with differences <b>in</b> acidity <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> changes in this quantity (ΔΔG). Also, the starting materials in these cases are different. In the case of pKa, the [...] "leaving group" [...] is bound to a proton in the starting material, while {{in the case of}} leaving group ability, the leaving group is bound to (usually) carbon. It is with these important caveats in mind that one must consider pKaH to be reflective of leaving group ability, but nevertheless the trends in each tend to correlate well with each other. Consistent with this picture, strong bases such as OH−, OR− and NR2− tend to make poor leaving groups, due their inability to stabilize a negative charge.|$|R

40|$|I have {{investigated}} how physical capabilities of users {{with a wide}} range of <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> their interactions with digital devices. I have formulated a simulator that embodies both the internal state of a computer application and also the perceptual, cognitive and motor processes of its user. The simulator can predict the likely interaction patterns when undertaking a task using a variety of input devices, and estimate the time to complete the task in the presence of different disabilities and for different levels of skill. The simulator consists of a perception model, a cognitive model and a motor behaviour model. The preparation model simulates the phenomena of visual perception (like focussing and shifting attention) and can also simulate the effects of different visual impairments on interaction. It has predicted the visual search time and eye gaze pattern of able-bodied people and a few types of visually impaired users with statistically significant accuracy. The cognitive model simulates expert performance by using CPM-GOMS model. It can also simulate performance of novices by using a dual-space model. The motor-behaviour model is based on statistical analysis of cursor traces from motor-impaired users. As part of the model, I have also developed a new scale of characterizing the extent of disability of users by measuring their grip strength. I have evaluated the simulator through an icon searching task undertaken by visually and motor impaired people and also used the simulator to develop a new assistive interaction technique. My studies have already been used to design an accessible game and the University has been awarded EU funding for a project that will build on results from my PhD research.

40|$|Background: The {{ability to}} {{identify}} and authenticate users {{is regarded as the}} foundation of computer security. Although new authentication technologies are evolving, passwords are the most common method used to control access in most computer systems. Research suggests that a large portion of computer security password breaches are the result of poor user security behaviour. The password creation and management practices that online consumers apply have a direct effect on the level of computer security and are often targeted in attacks. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate South African online consumers’ computer password security practices and to determine whether consumers’ perceptions regarding their password security <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> the password creation and management practices that they apply. Method: A Web-based survey was designed to (1) determine online consumers’ perceptions of their skills and competence in respect of computer password security and (2) determine the practices that South African online consumers apply when creating and managing passwords. The measures applied were then compared to (1) the users’ perceptions about their computer password security abilities and (2) the results of international studies to determine agreement and inconsistencies. Results: South African online consumers regard themselves as proficient password users. However, various instances of unsafe passwords practices were identified. The results of this South African study correspond with the results of various international studies confirming that challenges to ensure safe online transacting are in line with international challenges. Conclusion: There is a disparity between South African online consumers’ perceived ability regarding computer password security and the password creation and management practices that they apply. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} s-nitrosylation {{in the growth of}} ovarian cancer using cell culture based and in vivo approaches. Using the nitrosylating agent, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), a physiological nitric oxide molecule, we show that GSNO treatment inhibited proliferation of chemoresponsive and chemoresistant ovarian cancer cell lines (A 2780, C 200, SKVO 3, ID 8, OVCAR 3, OVCAR 4, OVCAR 5, OVCAR 7, OVCAR 8, OVCAR 10, PE 01 and PE 04) in a dose dependent manner. GSNO treatment abrogated growth factor (HB-EGF) induced signal transduction including phosphorylation of Akt, p 42 / 44 and STAT 3, which are known to play critical roles in ovarian cancer growth and progression. To examine the therapeutic potential of GSNO in vivo, nude mice bearing intra-peritoneal xenografts of human A 2780 ovarian carcinoma cell line (2 × 10 (6)) were orally administered GSNO at the dose of 1 mg/kg body weight. Daily oral administration of GSNO significantly attenuated tumor mass (p< 0. 001) in the peritoneal cavity compared to vehicle (phosphate buffered saline) treated group at 4 weeks. GSNO also potentiated cisplatin mediated tumor toxicity in an A 2780 ovarian carcinoma nude mouse model. GSNO's nitrosylating <b>ability</b> <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> the induced nitrosylation of various known proteins including NFκB p 65, Akt and EGFR. As a novel finding, we observed that GSNO also induced nitrosylation with inverse relationship at tyrosine 705 phosphorylation of STAT 3, an established player in chemoresistance and cell proliferation in ovarian cancer and in cancer in general. Overall, our study underlines the significance of S-nitrosylation of key cancer promoting proteins in modulating ovarian cancer and proposes the therapeutic potential of nitrosylating agents (like GSNO) for the treatment of ovarian cancer alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{estimate}} durations varies across individuals. Although {{previous studies have}} reported that individual differences in perceptual skills and cognitive capacities <b>are</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> brain structures, it remains unknown whether timing <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> also <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> the brain anatomy.

Better ability to discriminate subsecond durations was associated with a larger GM volume in the bilateral anterior cerebellum, whereas better performance in estimating the suprasecond range was associated with a smaller GM volume in the inferior parietal lobule. These results indicate that regional GM volume is predictive of an individual's timing abilities.

40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the hypopigmentation function of the essential oil from Vetiveria zizanioides (VZ-EO). Our results indicated that VZ-EO exhibits potent lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity to moderate the bleaching of β-carotene and to maintain the cellular glutathione (GSH) levels. VZ-EO can markedly decrease melanin production and tyrosinase activity in α-melanin-stimulating-hormone- (α-MSH-) stimulated B 16 cells. The effect of VZ-EO on melanogenesis is achieved by the suppression of cellular tyrosinase expression.

This <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> the large number of genes encoding proteins involved in carbohydrate utilization and transport in the genome of Thermotoga maritima. Due to their phylogenetic position as the deepest branch of bacterial heterotrophs, knowledge of the physiology of Thermotoga offers an evolutionary perspective on systems in other organisms. ^ The major objective of this thesis was to use DNA microarrays to obtain a global view of gene expression of T. maritima grown on glucose, lactose and maltose, and to have a better understanding of the metabolism and transports of these disaccharides in this bacterium. Expression in glucose-grown cells was used as the reference. The expression data from microarray analyses were confirmed by Northern and DNA dot blot hybridizations and real-time PCR. ^ Out of 1, 865 ORFs, 106 were differentially expressed in lactose- and only 24 were in maltose-grown cells. In lactose-grown cells, increases in expression of the β-galactosidase genes as well as genes encoding xylanase, xylosidase and glucuronidase suggested that a β-galactoside might be recognized by T. maritima as potential presence of more complex polysaccharides. Differential expression of genes encoding ABC oligopeptide transporters was also seen and is consistent with previous observations of oligopeptide-like binding proteins that actually bind oligosaccharides. Differential expression in genes encoding NADH dehydrogenases and NADH oxidase suggested a connection between redox balance and disaccharide catabolism. A potential role for dihydrolipoamidellipoamide in galactoside transport was proposed to explain the observed differential expression of a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase gene. Differential expression of the iron-sulfur cluster assembly SufBCDS, ferrous ion transporters and several iron-sulfur proteins in glucose- and lactose-grown cells may point to a complex interaction of sugar, iron and sulfur metabolisms. ^ The data gathered from this work provide new information on how T. maritima responds to a β-galactoside and an α-glucoside as the sole carbon source. The proposed hypotheses offer new directions for future investigations into sugar transport and metabolism in this organism. ...|$|R

The clay mineralogical composition of the paddy soils was well correlated with the geological characteristics of the sediment from which the paddy soils were derived. The paddy soils distributed along the Chikugo river, the biggest river in Kyushu, were characterized by the presence of smectite. The paddy soils along the Yabe river and at the foots of the Minou and Yame mountains composed of crystalline schist contained relatively high amounts of chlorite and clay mica. The paddy soils at the foots of mountains composed of andesite or granite and on the Pleistocene terrace were dominated by kaolin mineral. The mineralogical difference of the soils can be related to the difference in the natural soil fertility and soil buffering <b>ability,</b> and <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> the highest rice grain yield of the paddy soils along the Chikugo river. 土壌環境基礎調査で集められた, 福岡県筑後山間および筑後平野地域の水田土壌の粘土含量を測定し, 粘土画分の層状ケイ酸塩粘土鉱物を同定した. 粘土含量は 78 ～ 430 gkg^ の間で変動し, 幅広い組成の粘土鉱物がみられた. 粘土鉱物組成と粘土含量に基づき, 95 地点の粘土鉱物組成区分を行った. 粘土鉱物組成区分によれば, 筑後山間および筑後平野地域の水田は, 大きくは 3 つの地帯に分けられた. ひとつは筑後川流域(筑後川中流平野・南筑平野) で, スメクタイトの存在によって特徴づけられた. 二番目は矢部川下流域と耳納山地および八女山地の山麓・山間で, 結晶片岩由来堆積物から成り, 相対的に多い緑泥石と雲母粘土鉱物を含んでいた. 三番目はそれ以外の, 耳納山地東部の安山岩, 久留米市南部・八女市の更新世堆積物, 大牟田市北東部山麓の花崗岩に由来する堆積物を母材とする地帯で, カオリン鉱物含量の高いことを共通とした. このような粘土鉱物学的性質の違いは, 土壌の潜在的水稲生産能, 環境保全能の相違に関係づけられ, 筑後川流域の水田土壌の最も高い水稲収量に反映された...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates how {{litigation}} {{against an}} auditfirm affects {{the market value}} of its publicly traded clients. We examine the impact of private litigation alleging audit failure on the audit firm ’s clients not in-volved in the lawsuit. Our results indicate that clients not involved in the litigation experience significant negative returns at the announcement of litigation against their audit Jirm. These results suggest that the market interprets litigation against an audit f i rm as a signal of decreased audit quality and that the market places a value on audit quality when pricing a firm’s securities. The results are also consistent with an audit insurance explanation, which views the audit firm as a source of potential financial indemnification to investors and predicts that damage to the auditor’s underwriting <b>ability</b> will <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> reduced securities prices for the firm’s clients. When the analysis was restricted to companies in the same industry where the alleged audit failure occurred, the market response is signijicantly more negative when the audit jirm is considered a specialist in that industry than when the audit jirm is not u specialist. Finally, the market response is weaker later in the sample period, consistent with the findings of prior research that the frequency of nonmeritorious suits has increased over time. 1...|$|R
40|$|Objective : A person 2 ̆ 7 s health literacy, i. e., {{their ability}} to seek, {{understand}} and use health information, is a critical determinant of whether {{they are able to}} actively participate in their healthcare. The objective {{of this study was to}} conceptualise health literacy from the patient perspective. Methods : Using comprehensive qualitative methods 48 individuals were interviewed across three distinct groups in Australia: those with a chronic condition, the general community and individuals who had recently presented to a metropolitan public hospital emergency department. Purposeful sampling was employed to ensure a range of experiences was captured. Results : Seven key <b>abilities</b> <b>were</b> identified: knowing when to seek health information; knowing where to seek health information; verbal communication skills; assertiveness; literacy skills; capacity to process and retain information; application skills. Conclusion : This study identifies key abilities patients identified as critical to seek, understand and utilise information in the healthcare setting. These <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> not <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> existing measures for health literacy. Future measures of health literacy could consider incorporating abilities identified in this study and may provide guidance in developing health interventions to assist patients to participate effectively in their health. Practice implications : More comprehensive measures to assess patient 2 ̆ 7 s health literacy are needed...|$|R
