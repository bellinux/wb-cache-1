5|$|<b>Allergic</b> symptoms, {{including}} rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma, {{have been}} documented in laboratory animal workers who {{come into contact with}} guinea pigs. <b>Allergic</b> reactions following direct exposure to guinea pigs in domestic settings have also been reported. Two major guinea pig allergens, Cav p I and Cav p II, have been identified in guinea pig fluids (urine and saliva) and guinea pig dander. People who are <b>allergic</b> to guinea pigs are usually <b>allergic</b> to hamsters and gerbils, as well. Allergy shots can successfully treat an allergy to guinea pigs, although treatment can take up to 18 months.|$|E
5|$|Like other platinum-group metal, bulk Pd {{is quite}} inert. Although contact {{dermatitis}} has been reported, {{data on the}} effects are limited. It {{has been shown that}} people with an <b>allergic</b> reaction to palladium also react to nickel, making it advisable to avoid the use of dental alloys containing palladium on those so <b>allergic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{people suffer}} from <b>allergic</b> {{reactions}} after handling onions. Symptoms can include contact dermatitis, intense itching, rhinoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchial asthma, sweating, and anaphylaxis. <b>Allergic</b> reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions, possibly {{due to the}} denaturing of the proteins from cooking.|$|E
5|$|Some {{susceptible}} {{individuals have}} experienced an <b>allergic</b> reaction after touching Suillus americanus. The symptoms of <b>allergic</b> contact dermatitis generally develop {{one to two}} days after initial contact, persist for roughly a week, then disappear without treatment. Cooking the fruit bodies inactivates the responsible allergens.|$|E
5|$|Anaphylaxis is {{a serious}} <b>allergic</b> {{reaction}} that is rapid in onset and may cause death.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia stings {{are very}} potent, and the venoms from these ants {{are among the}} most toxic in the insect world. In Tasmania, 3% of the human {{population}} are <b>allergic</b> to the venom of M. pilosula and can suffer life-threatening anaphylactic reactions if stung; many human deaths have been recorded. People prone to severe <b>allergic</b> reactions can be treated with allergen immunotherapy (desensitisation).|$|E
5|$|Although the edibility of M.frustrata was not {{mentioned}} in the original description, Kuo has elsewhere written of the edibility of North American Morchella. In general, morels should not be eaten raw, as they can trigger <b>allergic</b> reactions in susceptible individuals. Their flavor is enhanced after they are fried, stuffed, or dried.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are glycoproteins {{belonging}} to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They constitute most of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood proteins. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may {{be attached to the}} antigen-binding fragments. The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five isotypes. Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds. The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region. The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. For example, IgE is responsible for an <b>allergic</b> response consisting of mast cell degranulation and histamine release. IgE's Fab paratope binds to <b>allergic</b> antigen, for example house dust mite particles, while its Fc region binds to Fc receptor ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates <b>allergic</b> signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.|$|E
5|$|Body {{piercing}} jewellery should be hypoallergenic. A number of materials are used, with varying strengths and weaknesses. Surgical stainless steel, niobium and titanium {{are commonly used}} metals, with titanium {{the least likely to}} cause <b>allergic</b> reaction of the three. Platinum and palladium are also safe alternatives, even in fresh piercings. Initial piercings should never be done with gold of any grade, as gold is mixed with other metals, and sterling silver is not a good alternative in a piercing, as it may cause allergies in initial piercings and will tarnish in piercings of any age. An additional risk for <b>allergic</b> reaction may arise when the stud or clasp of jewellery is made from a different metal than the primary piece.|$|E
5|$|Diphenhydramine, a first-generation H1 {{receptor}} antagonist {{or medicine}} that combats the H1 receptor that {{is associated with}} many <b>allergic</b> reactions, {{has been found to be}} the most potent antihistamine for this particular disease. Patients prescribed 50 milligrams four times per day have been able to sustain normal exposure to the sun without suffering a reaction.|$|E
5|$|Double <b>Allergic</b> is {{the second}} studio album by Australian {{alternative}} rock band Powderfinger. Released in Australia on 2 September 1996 Polydor, the album was produced by Tim Whitten and widely considered Powderfinger's mainstream breakthrough.|$|E
5|$|Follow-ups of {{untreated}} {{people over}} thirty {{with a history}} of severe <b>allergic</b> reactions would greatly benefit from venom immunotherapy. Both rapid and slow doses can be done safely during immunotherapy. The efficacy (capacity to induce a therapeutic effect) of ant venom immunotherapy is effective in reducing systemic reactions in comparison to placebo and whole body extract immunotherapy, where patients were more likely to suffer from a systemic reaction. Ultrarush initiation of insect immunotherapy may be used, but results show higher risks of <b>allergic</b> reactions. Despite immunotherapy being successful, only ten percent of patients do not have any response to desensitisation.|$|E
5|$|For a {{small number}} of people, taking aspirin can result in {{symptoms}} resembling an <b>allergic</b> reaction, including hives, swelling, and headache. The reaction is caused by salicylate intolerance and is not a true allergy, but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an overdose.|$|E
5|$|Honey {{bees are}} used commercially to produce honey. They also produce some {{substances}} used as dietary supplements with possible health benefits, pollen, propolis, and royal jelly, though {{all of these}} can also cause <b>allergic</b> reactions.|$|E
5|$|In {{individuals}} <b>allergic</b> to {{the venom}} (about 2–3% of the population), a sting sometimes causes anaphylactic shock. In comparison to other insects {{such as the}} western honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the European wasp (Vespula germanica), their rates are only 1.4% and 0.6%. The annual sting exposure rates for the jack jumper ant, Western honeybee and European wasp are 12%, 7% and 2%. The median time from sting to cardiac arrest is 15 minutes, but the maximum period is around three hours. The ant allergy does not disappear; people with jack jumper allergies will most likely suffer from another <b>allergic</b> reaction if re-stung. Approximately 70 percent of patients {{with a history of}} systemic reaction to the ant's sting have another reaction when stung again. In comparison, systemic reaction figures for Apis mellifera and Vespula germanica after being stung show a rate of 50% and 25%. About half of these reactions were life-threatening and occurred predominantly in people who had had previous incidents with the sting. Anaphylaxis in jack jumper ant stings are not rare; 2.9% of 600 residents from semi-rural Victoria had <b>allergic</b> reactions to the ant's sting, according to a questionnaire. The sensitivity to stings is persistent for many years.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, {{recurrent}} mouth ulcers may be {{a manifestation}} of an <b>allergic</b> reaction. Possible allergens include certain foods (e.g., chocolate, coffee, strawberries, eggs, nuts, tomatoes, cheese, citrus fruits, benzoates, cinnamaldehyde, and highly acidic foods), toothpastes, and mouthwashes. Where dietary allergens are responsible, mouth ulcers usually develop within about 12–24 hours of exposure.|$|E
5|$|One form {{of apple}} allergy, {{often found in}} {{northern}} Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome, and is found in people who are also <b>allergic</b> to birch pollen. <b>Allergic</b> reactions are triggered by a protein in apples {{that is similar to}} birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Reactions, which entail oral allergy syndrome (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat, but in rare cases can also include life-threatening anaphylaxis. This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits. Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Palladium {{is one of}} {{the three}} most popular {{alloying}} metals in white gold (nickel and silver can also be used). Palladium-gold is more expensive than nickel-gold, but seldom causes <b>allergic</b> reactions (though certain cross-allergies with nickel may occur).|$|E
5|$|Powderfinger {{spent much}} of early 1997 touring, after the success of Double <b>Allergic.</b> Songwriter Bernard Fanning then {{spent much of}} 1997 writing songs for Internationalist in Brisbane, drawing on {{inspiration}} from a mid-1997 band trip to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Reactions to {{the ants}} sting show similar {{symptoms}} to fire ant stings; namely local swelling which lasts for several days, and {{swelling of the}} lips, face and eyes may occur from a minor <b>allergic</b> reaction. Other common symptoms include watering of the eyes and nose, and hives or welts will begin to develop. Headaches, anxiety and flushing may also occur. Jack jumpers, bees and wasps {{are the most common}} causes of anaphylaxis from insect stings. People most commonly feel a sharp pain after these stings, similar to that from an electric shock. Some patients develop a systemic skin reaction after being stung. Localised envenomation occurs with every sting, but severe envenoming only occurs if someone has been stung many times (as many as 50 to 300 stings in adults). The heart rate increases, and blood pressure falls rapidly. Most people will only experience mild skin irritation after being stung. Those who suffer from a severe <b>allergic</b> reaction will show a wide variety of symptoms. This includes difficulty breathing and talking, the tongue and throat will swell up, and coughing, chest tightness, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting may occur. Others may lose consciousness and collapse (sometimes people may not collapse), and confusion. Children who get stung will show symptoms such as floppiness and paleness if a severe <b>allergic</b> reaction occurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{commercial}} use of beryllium requires {{the use of}} appropriate dust control equipment and industrial controls at all times because of the toxicity of inhaled beryllium-containing dusts that can cause a chronic life-threatening <b>allergic</b> disease in some people called berylliosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{greens are}} edible as a leaf vegetable, but are rarely eaten by humans; some sources {{suggest that the}} greens contain toxic alkaloids. When used for this purpose, they are {{harvested}} young in high-density plantings, before significant root development, and typically used stir-fried, or in salads. Some people are <b>allergic</b> to carrots. In a 2010 study on the prevalence of food allergies in Europe, 3.6 percent of young adults showed some degree of sensitivity to carrots. Because the major carrot allergen, the protein Dauc c 1.0104, is cross-reactive with homologues in birch pollen (Bet v 1) and mugwort pollen (Art v 1), most carrot allergy sufferers are also <b>allergic</b> to pollen from these plants.|$|E
5|$|Their sting {{generally}} only {{causes a}} mild local reaction in humans; however, {{it is one}} of the few ant species that can be dangerous to humans, along with other ants in the genus Myrmecia. The ant venom is particularly immunogenic for an insect venom; the venom causes about 90% of Australian ant allergies. In endemic areas, up to 3% of the human population has developed an allergy to the venom and about half of these <b>allergic</b> people can suffer from anaphylactic reactions (increased heart rate, falling blood pressure, and other symptoms), which can lead to death on rare occasions. Between 1980 and 2000, there were four deaths due to anaphylaxis from jack jumper stings, all of them in Tasmania. Individuals prone to severe <b>allergic</b> reactions caused by the ant's sting can be treated with allergen immunotherapy (desensitisation).|$|E
5|$|This form of {{treatment}} {{is meant to}} reduce the intensity or altogether eliminate the <b>allergic</b> reactions people have by gradually increasing exposure to the form of radiation that brings about the reaction. In the case of solar urticaria, phototherapy and photochemotherapy are the two major desensitization treatments.|$|E
5|$|Trivalent {{chromium}} {{occurs in}} trace amounts in foods, wine and water. In contrast, hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI) or Cr6+) is highly toxic and mutagenic when inhaled. Ingestion of chromium(VI) in {{water has been}} linked to stomach tumors, and it may also cause <b>allergic</b> contact dermatitis (ACD).|$|E
5|$|According to a 2011 review, {{there have}} been few studies on the {{efficacy}} of Proactiv. A 2011 Consumer Reports study compared Proactiv with two less expensive types of benzoyl peroxide, AcneFree and OXY Maximum, and found all three to be equally effective. The US Food and Drug Administration warned in 2014 that over-the-counter acne treatments can cause severe irritation, as well as rare but life-threatening <b>allergic</b> reactions.|$|E
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include hair loss, bone marrow suppression, vomiting, rash, and {{inflammation}} of the mouth. Other serious side effects may include <b>allergic</b> reactions such as anaphylaxis, heart damage, tissue damage {{at the site of}} injection, radiation recall, and treatment-related leukemia. People often experience red discoloration of the urine for a few days. Doxorubicin is in the anthracycline and antitumor antibiotic family of medications. It works in part by interfering with the function of DNA.|$|E
5|$|Double <b>Allergic</b> was {{released}} on 2 September 1996 in Australia on the Polydor record label. It entered the ARIA chart at #7, and spent ten weeks in the top ten. Over 200,000 copies were sold, and the album is currently certified 3x platinum, asserting at least 210,000 sales. The album finished 1996 at #44 on the ARIA end of year albums chart, and finished 1997 at #53.|$|E
5|$|Ectropion is {{the outward}} rolling of the eyelid, which {{abnormally}} exposes the eye, resulting in irritation. Because {{of the increased}} exposure, the dog can develop <b>allergic</b> or bacterial conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis sicca also known as dry-eye syndrome. It is most commonly found in breeds with exaggerated facial features such as the Boxer, Bloodhound, Gordon Setter {{as well as the}} English and American Cocker Spaniels, and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Histamines are {{proteins}} {{associated with}} many <b>allergic</b> reactions. When the UV radiation or light {{comes in contact}} with a person with solar urticaria, histamine is released from mast cells. When this occurs, the permeability of vessels near the area of histamine release is increased. This allows blood fluid to enter the vessels and cause inflammation. Antihistamines suppress {{the activity of the}} histamine.|$|E
5|$|If {{no signs}} of an <b>allergic</b> {{reaction}} are present, an ice pack or commercially available sprays are used to relieve the pain. Stingose is also recommended to treat a jack jumper sting. Other treatments include washing the stung area with soap and water, and if continuous pain remains for several days, antihistamine tablets are taken for one to three days.|$|E
5|$|Mainly nocturnal M. nigriceps {{is found}} in hot hilly areas and woodland, nesting {{underground}} in mounds. The ant's diet consists of sweet liquids from flowering plants and invertebrate prey, which are fed to the carnivorous larvae. Spiders are known to eat these ants, and echidnas consume the larvae and pupae. Like other Myrmecia species, M. nigriceps ants possess a powerful and painful sting, and the venom is capable of inducing <b>allergic</b> reactions in sensitive people.|$|E
5|$|Mast cells {{reside in}} {{connective}} tissues and mucous membranes, and regulate the inflammatory response. They {{are most often}} associated with allergy and anaphylaxis. Basophils and eosinophils are related to neutrophils. They secrete chemical mediators {{that are involved in}} defending against parasites and play a role in <b>allergic</b> reactions, such as asthma. Natural killer (NK cells) cells are leukocytes that attack and destroy tumor cells, or cells that have been infected by viruses.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Malory becomes {{temporally}} blinded {{after having}} an <b>allergic</b> reaction to zucchini. Seeing {{this as an}} opportunity to help themselves, secretary Cheryl and human resources representative Pam hack into the ISIS computer mainframe from Malory's office and alter their files, allowing them better health care and other perks they can not afford themselves. The whole time, Malory rants about how disgruntled she is about her own and others' life choices.|$|E
5|$|Radirgy is a shoot 'em up {{video game}} {{developed}} by MileStone and released for the Sega NAOMI arcade platform in 2005. The story follows schoolgirl Shizuru Kamigusa {{in an age}} filled with radio waves which she is <b>allergic</b> to. She must save her father, who is developing a remedy for her sickness, from terrorists who have taken control of his company. The game features bullet hell gameplay elements and a distinct cel shaded graphical style.|$|E
5|$|The green-head ant {{possesses}} a highly potent sting {{that can be}} painful but is short-lived. An icepack or commercially available spray {{can be used to}} relieve the pain, but individuals experiencing an <b>allergic</b> reaction are normally taken to the hospital for treatment. The venom is powerful enough to cause anaphylactic shock in sensitive humans. In a 2011 Australian ant allergy venom study, of which the objective was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis, it was shown that 34 participants reacted to the venom of the green-head ant. The rest of the participants reacted to Myrmecia venom, in particular, 176 to M. pilosula alone. The study concluded that four main groups of Australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis. The green-head ant was the only ant that was not a Myrmecia species to cause <b>allergic</b> reactions in participating individuals. Green-head ants have been reported causing mortality amongst poultry. Despite its potential danger to sensitive humans, green-head ants can be beneficial. They can serve as a form of pest control by killing agricultural pests such as beetle and moth larvae and termites.|$|E
