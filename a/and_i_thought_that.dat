Before then, I'd been frustrated because I wanted to be more hands-on. I just feel that TAC are doing it where it needs to happen. It really needed to be given support, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> perhaps I might be well-placed to do it.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1983, on her {{way back}} from Paris, Steinberg began dancing in the studio of Moses Pendleton, who had founded the modern dance company Pilobolus. She had been {{attracted}} to Pilobolus growing up: [...] "I was taller than most girls my age, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was a company I could be with because the women were always lifting the men." [...] There she joined up with Daniel Ezralow, Jamey Hampton, and Ashley Roland, and the four created the Connecticut-based, dancer-illusionist company MOMIX. From 1983 to 1986, Steinberg toured nationally with MOMIX. The group became known for their visual humour, contorted positions, and Trompe-l'œil effects.|$|E
500|$|Parker's {{experience}} {{playing in}} Israel left a positive impression upon him. He {{went on to}} wear jersey number 18 for both Toronto and Cleveland, explaining that: [...] "I played in Israel before I {{came back to the}} NBA, and I had such a great time... two of my sons were born while I was playing overseas and one was actually born in Israel. And I just had such a great experience that I wanted to take something from that experience. The number 18, in Judaism, it means 'chai'... and it's the symbol for life and good fortune in Judaism. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was something to take away from Israel and let them know I'm still representing them." ...|$|E
500|$|Nirvana {{originally}} wanted Kevin Kerslake, who {{had directed}} the videos for the band's singles [...] "Come as You Are", [...] "Lithium", [...] "In Bloom", and [...] "Sliver", {{to direct the}} [...] "Heart-Shaped Box" [...] music video. Kerslake prepared five treatments during July and August 1993, but no shoot arrangements were made {{and by the end}} of the month, the group decided to work with Dutch photographer and video director Anton Corbijn. Corbijn, who typically created his own ideas for videos, was initially unsure of directing the video since Cobain's treatment was so detailed. Corbijn said, [...] "But then I looked at it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> actually it was pretty good. I was very amazed by somebody writing a song and having those ideas as precise as he did." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Cocktails" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein, who plays Human Resources {{representative}} Toby Flenderson on the series. Lost series creator J. J. Abrams was hired on as episode director, his first such credit for the series. Abrams disliked the American series when it first premiered, due to his love for the original British series. The director explained, [...] "I resented it before I saw it, because I thought, 'well, {{how are you going}} to do what Ricky and Steve did. In fact, the first season I didn't get into it at all. In the second season, they really found their voice. And that's despite having to make 22 episodes, which is twice the length of what the BBC show did. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the show became brilliant. I was really impressed by how it worked." ...|$|E
500|$|Shore {{traced the}} concept {{for the title}} {{character}} to {{his experience as a}} patient at a teaching hospital. Shore recalled: [...] "I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be interesting to}} see a character who actually did that before they left the room." [...] A central part of the show's premise was that the main character would be disabled in some way. The original idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox rejected this. Jacobs later expressed her gratitude for the network's insistence that the character be reimagined—putting him on his feet added a crucial physical dimension. The writers ultimately chose to give House a damaged leg arising from an incorrect diagnosis, which requires him to use a cane and causes him pain that leads to a narcotic dependency.|$|E
500|$|Kesha re-recorded [...] "Dirty Picture" [...] for {{her debut}} studio album, Animal. The song was {{selective}} in its release only being sold as an album bonus track in United Kingdom and Ireland, and was dubbed [...] "Kesha edit" [...] or [...] "Dirty Picture, Pt. 2". The song {{is similar to}} the original recording of the song with the only noticeable change being that Kesha now sings the song's first verse. While being interviewed by Digital Spy Cruz explained how the cover initially came about and his view on the cover, [...] "she asked me if she could do a version of the song where she sang the first verse <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was a really cool idea. I really like both versions, and it's good that there are these two different versions out there, because fans of me get more of me on mine and [...] fans get more of her on hers." ...|$|E

5000|$|Walker {{stated that}} Fall {{was one of}} his {{favorite}} songs on his album. He also said after recording the track that “Keith stood up and high-fived the engineer when we got done with the vocal <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>that’s</b> the first that I’ve ever seen that, maybe he was just glad that I got all the lyrics right, it was refreshing to know there wasn’t a lot of wasted time in the studio with Keith. He knows what he wants and he communicates that with the musicians really well." ...|$|R

500|$|Katy Stevens {{notes that}} the {{dialogue}} in [...] "The Body" [...] was recorded with microphones {{very close to the}} actors, making variations in their voices—cracks, rises, and whispers—more prominent to the audience, to close the distance between the actors and the viewer. Conversely, the scene in which Dawn is told of Joyce's death was shot through a large classroom window, muffling Dawn's emotional reaction, to isolate Buffy and Dawn from the class and the audience. Several moments of silence follow this scene. Whedon shot the conversation up close several times, filming over-the-shoulder and reaction shots, but eventually went with a more distanced point of view. Michelle Trachtenberg later said of this effect, [...] "obviously you know in the end result there was no sound <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was actually one of the most brilliant ideas [...] ever had because it allows everyone to sort of attach their own emotional plug into whatever might have happened in your life. I think it allowed the audience to really connect with Dawn for the first time." ...|$|E
500|$|Series creator David Shore {{traced the}} concept for House to his {{background}} as a patient at a teaching hospital. Shore recalled that [...] "I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be interesting}} to see a character who actually did that before they left the room." [...] In 2004, Shore and executive producers Katie Jacobs and Paul Attanasio pitched House to Fox as a medical detective showa hospital whodunit where the doctors would be the sleuths looking for the source of symptoms. The ideas behind House's character were added after Fox bought the show. Shore wrote the pilot with a vivid memory of a doctor's visit: he once had to wait two weeks to get a doctor's appointment for a sore hip, by which point his pain had disappeared. Nevertheless, Shore stated that the doctors were [...] "incredibly polite". Shore later stated that, as he wrote the pilot, he fell in love with a character who, as a doctor, would actually ask the question [...] "Why am I wasting your time?".|$|E
500|$|... "Canvassing" [...] {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of Marlene Griggs-Knope, Leslie's mother and an important public figure in the Pawnee school system. Marlene was played by Pamela Reed, who would continue to make several guest appearances as the character. During the casting auditions, Seth Gordon interviewed Reed {{as if she were}} playing the character and Reed improvised a great deal, creating many personality elements that were eventually incorporated into Marlene Knope's character. Gordon said, [...] "Pamela was especially sort of nimble on her feet at inventing a character in the room on the fly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was really impressive." [...] During the audition, Reed was asked whether she was proud of her daughter, and Reed replied, [...] "I want my daughter to be successful, which is why I always tell her, there's nothing wrong with being a wife and mother." [...] The improvised line, which was based on something her father-in-law said to her, so impressed the producers that they incorporated it into the episode. Schur said the producers sought to establish Leslie's mother early in the series, and he felt her relationship to Leslie {{was the center of the}} entire [...] "Canvassing" [...] episode. Schur said of Leslie's attempts to impress her mom at her public forum, [...] "We imagined it in the writer's room that she is eight years old and doing a piano recital, and she's nervous because her mom's there." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{the sets}} were {{being built in}} Las Vegas, {{producer}} Frank Mancuso, Jr., son of Paramount president Frank Mancuso, Sr., had the screenplay rewritten in secret, and gave Bakshi a new screenplay by screenwriters Michael Grais and Mark Victor that [...] "was barely the same". Larry Gross {{also contributed to the}} script, but his work would later go on to be uncredited. In interviews {{at the time of the}} film's release, Mancuso, Jr., who was best known for the Friday the 13th franchise, stated a desire to move away from horror films, and wanted to produce a film [...] "about what happens when someone creates a world, becomes defined by it, and then can't escape [...] a film about being trapped by your own creation." [...] Bakshi remembers that he got into a fight with Mancuso, Jr. and [...] "punched [...] in the mouth." [...] Paramount threatened Bakshi with a lawsuit if he refused to complete the film. [...] "I thought if I did the animation well, it would be worth it, but you know what? It wasn't worth it." [...] Bakshi also stated that he [...] "had a lot of animators there that I'd brought in <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> maybe I could just have fun animating this stuff, which I did." [...] Bakshi had developed the film as a mix of comedy and horror that he described as [...] "a hard R-rated story" [...] but Paramount wanted a PG-13 film, one of the reasons for the doomed and angry relationship between filmmaker and studio.|$|E
500|$|Although Stanton did {{not know}} who murdered Archie, she guessed {{that it could be}} Stacey Slater (which turned out to be correct). Speaking of this, she said that Sophie {{was one of the few}} to {{correctly}} guess it was Stacey. [...] "I had an epiphany about a week before the live episode. It was a memory of the whole Who Shot Phil? storyline, and how there were eight different suspects, including some really hard blokes, and it turned out to be Lisa. I knew DCI Marsden wasn’t going to get the culprit, because of a couple of scenes of the following episode we’d shot in December, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> narratively, Stacey was the only person who the audience would forgive, and who could get away with it. That was my theory and it turned out to be right!" [...] Naomi Mcelroy from The Sunday Mirror thought that Marsden could be Archie's killer. Marsden left on 22 February 2010, and returned on 5 January 2012. She returned after Phil is framed for Kevin Wicks' (Phil Daniels)'s death and that of a homeless man, who died accidentally in a car-lot fire (part of an insurance scam). According to Inside Soap the police would begin questioning Phil's former fiancée Stella Crawford's death, teasing Marsden's return: [...] "The investigation is set to bring Phil face to face with his old nemisis, DCI Marsden – and this time she'll stop at nothing to put the bad boy permanently behind bars". Digital Spy reported that Marsden re-opens the investigation into Stella's death, [...] "suspecting that all is not what it seems". Finally, Marsden returned for two single episodes on 17 August 2012.|$|E
500|$|An {{ensemble}} of 20 actors {{make up the}} bulk of the series' cast. Hawley found ensembles enticing because they presented [...] "a lot of really good moving pieces". At Paleyfest 2015, the Fargo creator commented: [...] "It's sort of like a horse race in a way, especially when you know that everyone is on this collision course. It's like, 'Who's going to make it?' And you can put people together in unexpected pairings." [...] Offerman played Karl Weathers, an alcoholic and the only lawyer in Luverne, and Cristin Milioti was assigned the part of Betsy Solverson, Lou's terminally ill wife. Hawley felt that Milioti was the right choice because her personality was similar to her character's. Garrett portrays Joe Bulo, and Bokeem Woodbine appears as Mike Milligan, a role he was offered two days after auditioning. For the role of Hanzee Dent, Hawley hired Zahn McClarnon two weeks after his audition. Six others play members of the Gerhardts: Kieran Culkin as Rye, Rachel Keller as Simone, Michael Hogan as Otto, Allan Dobescu as Charlie, Angus Sampson as Bear, and Jeffrey Donovan as Dodd. When asked about his decision to cast Donovan, Hawley told the actor, [...] "I don't know. You just come off with a sense of power. I think Dodd comes off with a sense of power, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> you have the chops to find the humor in it." [...] Donovan gained 30 pounds in preparation for his role. Other major supporting roles in Fargo second season include: Bruce Campbell as Ronald Reagan, Keir O'Donnell as Ben Schmidt, and Elizabeth Marvel as Constance Heck.|$|E

500|$|The {{screenplay}} {{was written}} by Eric Warren Singer after he developed {{an interest in the}} banking scandals from the 1980s and 90s, he was looking for [...] "a paranoid thriller vibe" [...] from that period; [...] "The Godfather III was really the only film up to this point that dealt with the banking scandals, because it was really gangster warfare on a corporate level, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was {{the best part of the}} film." [...] Later reviewers compared it directly to The Parallax View (1974) and All The President's Men (1976). [...] Ridley Scott initially expressed an interest in directing the film, and the studio agreed to finance the project, only for Scott to drop out. A year later Tom Tykwer got involved through his agent, but decided a contemporary setting would work better. In April 2007, Clive Owen agreed to perform in The International. He said the script interested him because he was reminded of [...] "those '70s paranoia pictures" [...] and because it combined a factual, intelligent basis with an international thriller plot. The following July, actress Naomi Watts was cast opposite Owen. In August, the film received US$5.4 million from the [...] toward its budget. The following month its funding increased to $7.9 million, based on the board's assessment that two-thirds of The International would be produced in Germany and that a number of Germans were in important roles, such as actors Armin Mueller-Stahl and Axel Milberg, cinematographer Frank Griebe, and production designer Uli Hanisch. Filming began in Berlin on 10 September 2007. Part of the production took place in Babelsberg Studios.|$|E
500|$|After making three {{separate}} returns in September 2013, September 2014 {{and another in}} February 2015 to commemorate 30 years of EastEnders in EastEnders Live Week, Windsor made an unannounced return to EastEnders in 2016, appearing in the episode broadcast on 15 January. After this, {{it was announced that}} the character was to be killed off, losing her battle with breast cancer. The scenes were filmed in secret in November 2015, following Windsor's personal decision for Peggy to be killed. She said: [...] "Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that is something I need to shut the door on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> whilst , who I adore, is still in charge I want him {{to be the one to}} oversee it. I am grateful that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy’s last scenes." [...] Treadwell-Collins said, [...] "when [...] told me her decision back in the summer , we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square. In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with EastEnders as The Queen Vic itself. So this is the end of an EastEnders era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had. We can't wait to have Barbara back at EastEnders, even if it is for the final time. The most professional of professionals on set and off, and a true friend, we have all been working harder than ever to make Barbara and Peggy Mitchell proud." [...] Windsor resumed filming on 21 March 2016.|$|E
