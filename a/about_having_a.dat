5|$|During the {{planning}} of NG Life, Mizuho Kusanagi discussed with her editor <b>about</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> female lead protagonist allowing the readers to relate more to the protagonist. However, a male lead was settled for and the story was written in a romantic-panic comedy style. Kusanagi planned to end the series in its fourth volume, but wanted to add {{more to the story}} as it progressed resulting in more volumes. She also commented that even though she struggled with the plot, she enjoyed drawing the characters in the end. In the final chapter, the author revealed she had planned to pair Keidai with Mii since the beginning.|$|E
5|$|The show borrows {{elements}} and its design style from his Uncle Grandpa short, which was pitched {{to the network}} as a pilot. According to Browngardt, they were unsure <b>about</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> series centered on the title character, and felt the monster characters from the pilot had more potential. Character designer Robertryan Cory and David P. Smith (a director and storyboard artist on Dexter's Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls) were brought on board to help shape the project's development.|$|E

Tony leaves with them, and Jim puts on Tony's prop crown, imagining himself in the leading role.|$|E
5|$|Halos {{characters}} were continually refined through development, {{as the company}} was bought by Microsoft and the platform shifted from the Macintosh to the Xbox. Other Bungie developers would often add input to the progress of characters in Halo, {{even if they were}} not working on the game itself. For example, an outside artist, Shi Kai Wang, developed the early concept sketches of what would eventually become the Master Chief. However upon developing a 3D model, the artists decided the Chief looked too slender, almost effeminate, and subsequently bulked up the character. Early Covenant Elites had a more natural jaw rather than the split mandibles they would later sport; at one point, Jason Jones was also insistent <b>about</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> tail on the Elites, but this idea was eventually dropped.|$|E

Jacqui plans to adopt because of her criminal record. Tony discovers he has a secret child called Harry. Jacqui forces Tony to make a choice: Harry or her. Tony chooses Harry and she ends their relationship and leaves. An intoxicated Tony and Mercedes betray Jacqui by sleeping together. Jacqui fails to resist Tony again and they restart their on-off relationship. She then changes her surname back to McQueen from Malota and Mercedes reveals that she is pregnant and Jacqui asks Mercedes to let her and Tony raise the baby, unaware it's Tony's baby but Mercedes has an abortion, infuriating Jacqui so Myra offers to be her surrogate but she refuses.

5|$|Abi {{gets her}} job back at The Queen Vic and celebrates with Lauren and Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Lee's {{pregnant}} fiancée. Abi drunkenly confesses to Lauren about her one-night stand with Lee, so she urges Abi {{to confess to}} Whitney, as Whitney has caught chlamydia from Lee. Abi does so but this results in much resentment. Babe emotionally blackmails Abi, forcing her to resign. Abi exposes Babe's secrets to the pub's landlord, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) with Whitney defending her, so he tells Abi that she can keep her job, but this causes tension when she is later threatened by Babe. However Abi struggles to work on her own and so Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) is forced to ask Babe back to help her. Abi then persistently bickers about an order and lack of hygiene so blames it on Babe. Angry with Abi's behaviour, Linda sacks her. Abi locks Babe in the kitchen freezer room {{as an act of}} revenge, although Babe frames her sister Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) who she strongly dislikes and has Alzheimer's disease. Abi is then reinstated at the Vic by a seemingly apologetic Babe but her behaviour, when alone in the kitchen with Abi, is threatening. Babe later leaves Walford after being thrown out by her family, so Abi runs the kitchen alone. Abi forms a friendship with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) when she moves in with Ben and Jay, and Donna convinces Abi to move in as well, though she feels bad about leaving Dot on her own, but Dot gives her blessing when Donna reveals that Abi wants to move out. Abi is inwardly resentful of Lauren's success and, following Lauren's secret abortion of which Abi was made aware, Abi tells Lauren's partner, Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) that they would make a good couple during a heart-to-heart, but he tells her she is too young to be a mother. On Father's Day, feeling second best to Lauren and wound up during an argument with Steven, Abi reveals the abortion. Lauren is jealous when her boss, Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre), flirts with Abi, which leads to an argument, with Abi throwing a drink over her sister and then evicting her from the party. Later, the tension simmering between Abi and Steven leads to them having sex, even though he warns her it will mean nothing. Abi and Steven continue an affair and Abi learns that Steven is lying <b>about</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> brain tumour so that Lauren will not leave him. Despite being against the idea, Abi does not tell Lauren as Steven promises Abi he is planning to leave Lauren to be with her. Then Abi is stunned by Steven's public marriage proposal to Lauren. Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) overhears Abi and Steven talking about their relationship and confronts them. Abi then discovers she is pregnant by Steven.|$|E

The decision was not cost free. Without closer control of a viceroy, Nanda {{would not be able to}} enlist any men from the remaining vassals in Upper Burma and Shan states in the following years.|$|E

25|$|A less amusing {{incident}} {{for which}} Holding is also remembered was kicking over the stumps in anger at an umpiring decision in New Zealand in 1979/80.

West Indies felt that the umpiring had been incompetent and against them throughout. After an appeal for caught behind was turned down, Holding turned and kicked the stumps in frustration.|$|E
25|$|In the 1984 presidential {{election}} the Democrats had nominated Walter Mondale, a traditional New Deal-type liberal as their candidate.

After Bush's image was affected by his involvement on the Iran-Contra scandal much more than Reagan's, and after the Democrats won back control of the U.S. Senate in the 1986 congressional elections following an economic downturn, the party's leaders felt more optimistic <b>about</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> closer race with the GOP in 1988, although probabilities from winning the presidency were still marginal with the contemporary climate of prosperity.|$|E
25|$|Whether the Western Rite survives in the Eastern Orthodox Church {{and will}} be {{accepted}} by the majority who follow the Byzantine Rite remains yet to be seen. In the meantime, the Byzantine Rite bishops who oversee Western Rite parishes and many who oversee no Western Rite parishes continue to declare the Western Rite members of their Church to be Orthodox Christians and regard them as fully in communion {{with the rest of the}} Church. Though there have been negative appraisals on both sides of the Western Rite issue, supporters of the Western Rite claim that there is nothing inherently divisive <b>about</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> separate liturgical practice, particularly since these churches remain under the pastoral care of their diocesan bishop rather than a Western Rite bishop. As yet, there are no schisms within the episcopacy of any Orthodox Church regarding the issue of Western Rite parishes.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s, Steven's storylines mostly {{concerned}} his paternity and {{the ongoing}} custody battle between Cindy (Michelle Collins) and his stepfather Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). In the early 2000s, a darker side to adolescent Steven began to emerge as he began writing poison pen letters to neighbours, before moving to New Zealand {{to be with his}} father. In the late 2000s, Steven's storyline focused on his hostile relationship with Ian, and involved stalking Ian, taking Ian hostage, multiple suicide attempts, and accidentally shooting Ian's new wife, Jane (Laurie Brett). After a stay in a psychiatric hospital, Steven attempted to settle down in Albert Square, dating Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) but struggling with his sexuality and an attraction to Jane's brother Christian Clarke (John Partridge). He later left for New Zealand again after attempting to murder his grandmother, Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). Since his 2016 return, Steven's storylines have included repairing his relationship with his stepfather, his increasingly manipulative attempts at holding onto a relationship with Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa), and an affair with Lauren's sister Abi (Lorna Fitzgerald); causing her pregnancy, lying <b>about</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> brain tumour and trying to kill Jane again by setting fire to the restaurant. Steven later attempts to save Jane but is injured by Max Branning (Jake Wood) triggering a cardiac arrest shortly after he promises to make his relationship with Abi work as she tells him about her pregnancy.|$|E
