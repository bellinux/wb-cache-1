500|$|In January 2010, Sevigny won a Golden Globe {{award for}} Best Supporting Actress– Series, Miniseries or Television Film for her {{performance}} in the third season of Big Love. The series itself also received nominations in two other categories. During a press conference following the award win, Sevigny addressed the repressed women living in the fundamentalist Mormon compounds: [...] "These women are kept extremely repressed. They should be helped. They don't even know who {{the president of the}} United States is." [...] In addition, she had various screening credits that year: Sevigny landed major roles in two independent comedy films: Barry Munday and Mr. Nice in Munday, Sevigny plays the sister of a homely woman who is expecting a child by a recently castrated womanizer (opposite Patrick Wilson and Judy Greer); in Mr. Nice, she had a leading role as British marijuana-trafficker Howard Marks' wife, alongside Rhys Ifans; the film was based on Marks' autobiography of the same name. In a later interview with The A.V. Club, Sevigny was asked if she felt that the show's message was that polygamy was [...] "wrong". In response, Sevigny stated: [...] "No, <b>absolutely</b> <b>not.</b> I think there are more parallels to gay rights and alternative lifestyles within Big Love—more so than 'Polygamy is wrong'. I think they actually condone people who decide to live this lifestyle outside of fundamentalist sects." [...] During the same interview, Sevigny stated her disappointment with the series' fourth season, calling it [...] "awful" [...] and [...] "very telenovela"—though she stated that she loves her character and the writing, she felt the show [...] "got away from itself". Sevigny later regretted making the statements, saying she was very [...] "exhausted" [...] and [...] "wasn't thinking about what [...] was saying"; she also apologized to the show's producers. [...] " [...] that I was biting the hand that feeds me, because I obviously love the show and have always been nothing but positive about it. And I didn't want anybody to misunderstand me or think that I wasn't, you know, appreciative." ...|$|E
