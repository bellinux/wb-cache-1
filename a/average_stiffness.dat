40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the earthquake response of deteriorating systems. A model for stiffness degrading or deteriorating systems is used to describe six different singledegree- of -freedom systems. A numerical investigation of the response of these six systems is performed using an ensemble of twelve earthquakes. The response is studied at nine nominal periods of oscillation. The numerical results are presented as response spectra corresponding to six different ductilities. An approximate analytical method for calculating the earthquake response of deteriorating systems from a linear response spectrum is presented. The method, called the <b>average</b> <b>stiffness</b> and energy method, is based upon the premise that a linear system may be defined which is in some sense equivalent to the deteriorating system. The criterion for equivalence in this method is that the <b>average</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the deteriorating system be equal to the stiffness of the linear system and the average energy dissipated by the linear system be the same as the average energy dissipated by the deteriorating system. The new analytical method is compared to existing methods. Comparison with the numerical results is also made.

40|$|Study Design. The {{strength}} of sacral screw fixation achieved with techniques using one sacral screw and two triangulated sacral screws with Chopin block was tested on 10 fresh human sacrum specimens. Objectives. To compare the stiffness {{and the failure}} {{strength of}} single sacral screw fixation and those of two divergent triangulated sacral screw fixation under different loading conditions. Summary of Background Data. Weak sacral screw fixation is the major cause of failure in instrumented lumbosacral fusion. Although previous studies have evaluated the strength of anteromedially and anterolaterally inserted sacral screws, the strength of two divergent triangulated sacral screws has not been evaluated biomechanically. It is assumed that {{increasing the number of}} sacral screws and using a triangulated insertion technique may increase the strength of purchase for lumbosacral fixation. Methods. Ten fresh human sacrum specimens were used in this study. Six specimens were from donors less than 30 years of age (younger group), and the other four were from donors more than 60 years of age (aged group). The specimens were assigned randomly to either one side with one S 1 pedicle screw inserted anteromedially or to the other side with two screws directed anteromedially and anterolaterally. All specimens were tested with an Instron material testing machine (Instron Limited, High Wycombe, England). The <b>average</b> <b>stiffness</b> under compression, tension, and torsion were calculated from the average slopes of the load deformation curves. The failure load was applied for the final testing. Results. The results showed significant differences in stiffness between fixation with one screw and fixation with two divergent triangulated screws. With one S 1 pedicle screw fixation, the <b>average</b> <b>stiffness</b> was 203 N/mm for compression, 147 N/mm for tension, and 2 Nm/°for torsion. With two-screw fixation, the <b>average</b> <b>stiffness</b> increased to 255 N/mm (126 %), 185 N/mm (126 %) and 2. 4 Nm/°(120 %), respectively. The average failure strength under tension loads was found to be 1450 N in the younger specimens and was reduced to 980 N in the aged specimens. Conclusion. This study showed that fixation with two divergent triangulated screws to the sacrum was significantly stronger than one-screw fixation for lumbosacral fusion. The strength of fixation seems to have a negative correlation with aging. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

One mesh period is defined as an angular displacement of the pinion experiencing a double-tooth-pair meshing duration and a single-tooth-pair meshing duration. For double-tooth-pair meshing durations, 4, 6 and 8 mesh periods have mesh stiffness reduction caused by slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting, respectively. The maximum <b>averaged</b> mesh <b>stiffness</b> reduction in a double-tooth-pair meshing duration is 1.57 %, 4.26 % and 19.02 % corresponding to slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting, respectively. While for single-tooth-pair meshing durations, 3, 5 and 7 mesh periods experience mesh stiffness reduction corresponding to slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting, respectively. The maximum <b>averaged</b> mesh <b>stiffness</b> reduction in a single-tooth-pair meshing duration is 11.61 %, 55.33 % and 55.83 % related to slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting, respectively. For each mesh period, the stiffness reduction in the single-tooth-pair meshing duration is larger than that in the double-tooth-pair meshing duration for two reasons: (a) the pitting mostly appear around the pitch line and the pitch line lies on the single-tooth-pair meshing duration, and (b) the perfect gear has a smaller <b>averaged</b> mesh <b>stiffness</b> in the single-tooth-pair meshing duration than the double-tooth-pair meshing duration.

Although the method presented is applied to railway overheads, this methodology can be easily applied to general vertical cable nets.

This dissertation aims to estimate potential improvements in stem value through selection for improved stiffness. A new method to model and value volumes of structural wood grades within a stem was used to calculate these value improvements. Data for each stem from a stand in Kaingaroa Forest bred for improved wood quality was used to perform this analysis. This data was from a stand bred for improved wood quality and included information on the stiffness, density and width of each growth ring for each stem. The data was {{in the form of}} cores. Height and volume data was not recorded and therefore needed to be modelled. The volumes of MSG 8, MSG 11 and MSG 13 wood were estimated by modelling the stem volume at the age when wood is produced that is stiff enough to qualify for each grade. The majority of stems had merchantable volumes between 1 - 2. 5 m 3 with the largest stems containing 3. 6 m 3. <b>Average</b> <b>stiffness</b> ranged between 5. 2 GPa and 11. 3 GPa with the stand average being 8. 4 GPa. There was no relationship between <b>average</b> <b>stiffness</b> and merchantable volume. Stem values were found to range between $ 60 -$ 131 /m 3 with the stand average being $ 91 /m 3.

The increases in value/m 3 were caused by large increases in the proportion of MSG 11 and MSG 13 wood held within the merchantable volume.

The objective {{of this study is}} to establish the relative strength of fixation of a distal femoral locking plate (DFLP) compared with the dynamic condylar screw (DCS) in the distal femur fractures. Materials and Methods: Study was conducted on 16 freshly harvested cadaveric distal femoral specimens, eight implanted with DCS and other eight with DFLP. The construct was made unstable by removing a standard sized medial wedge of 1 cm base (gap-osteotomy) beginning 6 cm proximal to the lateral joint line in distal metaphyseal region with the loss of medial buttress. Fatigue test was conducted under load control mode at the frequency of I Hz. Specimens were subjected to cyclic loading of 2 kN, under observation for 50, 000 cycles or until failure/cutout, which ever occurred earlier. Results: In DFLP group, there was no implant failure and the average number of cycles sustained was 50, 000. Six out of eight specimens completed 50, 000 cycles and two failed in DCS group. The average number of cycles sustained by DCS was 46150. Though the bone quality as assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry DEXA was comparable in both DFLP and DCS group (P = 0. 06), none failed in DFLP group and subsidence was 1. 02 ± 0. 34 mm (range: 0. 60 - 1. 32 mm), which was significantly 43 % lower (P = 0. 006) than subsidence in DCS group (1. 82 ± 0. 58; range: 1. 20 - 3. 08 mm).

Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 18 dry cadaveric femoral specimens, 9 of these were implanted with a Gamma nail and 9 with PFN. There was no significant difference found in average dual energy X-ray absorptiometry value between both groups. The construct was made unstable (AO type 31 A 3. 3) by removing a standard sized posteromedial wedge. These were tested on a cyclic physiological loading machine at 1 cycle/s with a load of 200 kg. The test was observed for 50, 000 loading cycles or until implant failure, whichever occurred earlier. Peak displacements were measured and analysis was done to determine construct stiffness and gap micromotion in axial loading. Result: It was observed that there was statistically significant difference in terms of displacement at the fracture gap and overall construct stiffness of specimens of both groups. PFN construct group showed a mean subsidence of 1. 02 mm and Gamma nail construct group showed mean subsidence of 2. 36 mm after cycling. The <b>average</b> <b>stiffness</b> of Gamma nail group was 62. 8 ΁ 8. 4 N/mm which was significantly lower than <b>average</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the PFN group (80. 4 ΁ 5. 9 N/mm) (P = 0. 03).

Conclusion: When considering micromotion (subsidence) and incidence of implant/screw failure, double screw device (PFN) had statistically significant lower micromotion across the fracture gap with axial compression and lower incidence of implant failure.
