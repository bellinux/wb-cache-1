5|$|While on the trip, he did {{sketch a}} line of walking wounded, and some prisoners making {{their way to the}} rear from an early morning offensive. This became the basis of the {{painting}} The Harvest of Battle which was the largest single work Nevinson painted. It was completed in February 1919 and Nevinson arranged a 'private view' of the painting in his studio on 2 April for numerous critics and journalists. Whilst this produced some favourable reviews, notably in the Daily Express, it also led to articles claiming that the painting was so grim that it was being withheld from the public. When the painting was shown <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> The Nation's War Paintings and Drawings exhibition organised by the Imperial War Museum in December 1919 at Burlington House Nevinson was furious to find it had not been hung in the main room but rather in a side gallery. He began a campaign of vilification against all those he held responsible for this insult. Unreasonable as Nevinsons' outrage was it did have consequences; it destroyed his friendship with Muirhead Bone, who had been on the organising committee for the exhibition, made the Imperial War Museum wary of dealing with him, and blinded Nevinson himself to the high esteem in which his war paintings were held.|$|E

The Oak Ridge community was entirely a creation of the war. It grew from empty woods in 1941 to a city of 70,000 (Tennessee's fifth largest) four years later.|$|E

25|$|The {{disaster}} was {{met with}} worldwide shock and outrage <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> loss {{of life and the}} regulatory and operational failures that had led to it. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety. One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today. Additionally, several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications—which could have saved many more passengers.|$|E
25|$|This changed due to France's concern <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> {{expansion}} in British commerce and wealth {{arising from the}} commercial clauses of the Treaty of Utrecht. This increased their ability to finance a war while the British monarch's dual status as ruler of Hanover complicated France's strategic aims in Europe. A Stuart regime might {{solve the problem of}} Hanover but not Britain's economic power. This made an ongoing, low cost Jacobite insurgency more useful to France than a full scale Restoration, as Charles himself later pointed out. In addition, their statesmen continually underestimated the cost and complexity of seaborne invasions which meant a great deal of planning but very little action.|$|E

Hambleton was concealed by a low fog bank as he landed in a dry rice paddy, unseen by the NVA troops. As Jankowski observed Hambleton land, his aircraft came under heavy antiaircraft fire.

500|$|After these {{pantomime}} performances proved {{popular with}} audiences, Leno {{was hired in}} 1888 by Augustus Harris, manager at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, to appear in that year's Christmas pantomime, Babes in the Wood. Harris's pantomime productions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> theatre were known for their extravagance and splendour. [...] Each one had a cast of over a hundred performers, ballet dancers, acrobats, marionettes and animals, and included an elaborate transformation scene and an energetic harlequinade. Often they were partly written by Harris. Herbert Campbell and Harry Nicholls starred with Leno in the next fifteen Christmas productions at Drury Lane. [...] Campbell {{had appeared in the}} theatre's previous five pantomimes and was a favourite of the writer of those productions, E. L. Blanchard. Blanchard left the theatre when Leno was hired, believing that music hall performers were unsuitable for his Christmas pantomimes. This was not a view shared by audiences or the critics, one of whom wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|A Spanish {{proposal}} to swap Gibraltar for Ceuta {{on the other}} side of the Strait was considered but was eventually rejected. It was ultimately decided that Gibraltar's strategic position as a naval base outweighed its potential vulnerability from the landward side. From 1889, the Royal Navy was greatly expanded and both Gibraltar and Malta were equipped with new, torpedo-proof harbours and expanded, modernised dockyards. The works at Gibraltar were carried out by some 2,200 men <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> cost of £5million (£billion in 2013 prices). Under the reforming leadership of First Sea Lord Admiral John [...] "Jacky" [...] Fisher, Gibraltar became the base for the Atlantic Fleet. In the British public's imagination, Gibraltar was seen as [...] "a symbol of British naval power [...] a symbol of the empire which has been built and, more than the British lion or even John Bull himself, has come to represent Britain's power and prestige across the world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gordon's {{task was}} made easier by {{innovative}} military ideas Ward had {{implemented in the}} Ever Victorious Army. Gordon was quite critical of the way Chinese generals fought the war, observing that the Chinese were willing to inflict and accept gargantuan losses in battle, an approach Gordon disapproved of. Gordon wrote: [...] "The great thing...is to cut off their retreat, and the chances are they will go without trouble; but attack them in the front, and leave their rear open, and they fight most desperately". Gordon always preferred to outflank the Taiping lines rather to take them on frontally, an approach that caused much tension with his counterparts in the Chinese Imperial Army who did not share Gordon's horror <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> numbers of dead caused by frontal assaults.|$|E

Following his departure from Sefton and a brief post with the Prince of Wales Hotel group, an opportunity came in 1977, aged 36, to purchase the Ardwick Theatre in Manchester – soon followed by the New Theatre in Oxford – and so Apollo Leisure had lift off, and gradually over the following years Apollo became the biggest theatre owners/management team in the United Kingdom.|$|E

The latter problem can be addressed by studying Ws in a tt‾ environment, exploiting the triggering opportunities this brings, and I discuss the use of an isolation technique – requiring single particle jets – which can help to separate signal from the QCD background.
