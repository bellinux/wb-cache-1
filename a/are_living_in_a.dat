Human Rights Watch, Front Line, The Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders, and the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy also advocated on Dhondup Wangchen's behalf.

In this role he was responsible for the civil defence and air-raid precautions of New South Wales, which became increasingly more important after the entry of Japan in the Second World War in December 1941 and subsequent attacks on Australia on Darwin and Sydney in 1942.

500|$|Masters and Johnson's research, {{as well as}} Shere Hite's, {{generally}} supported Kinsey's {{findings about}} the female orgasm. Masters and Johnson were the first researchers to determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. They observed that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms have the same stages of physical response, {{and found that the}} majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasms, while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms. On that basis, they argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood. The research came {{at the time of the}} second-wave feminist movement, which inspired feminists to reject the distinction made between clitoral and vaginal orgasms. Feminist Anne Koedt argued that because men [...] "have orgasms essentially by friction with the vagina" [...] and not the clitoral area, this is why women's biology had not been properly analyzed. [...] "Today, with extensive knowledge of anatomy, with , Kinsey, and Masters and Johnson, to mention just a few sources, there is no ignorance on the subject ," [...] she stated in her 1970 article The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm. She added, [...] "There are, however, social reasons why this knowledge has not been popularized.

Upon its March 2007 release in Ireland, RTÉ's Caroline Hennessy gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and termed it [...] "an unexpected treasure". About the acting, this Irish reviewer commented, [...] "Once has wonderfully natural performances from the two leads. Although musicians first and actors second, they acquit themselves well in both areas. Irglová, a largely unknown quantity alongside the well-known and either loved or loathed Hansard, is luminous." [...] Michael Dwyer of The Irish Times gave the film the same rating, calling it [...] "irresistibly appealing" [...] and noting that [...] "Carney makes the point - without ever labouring it - that his protagonists <b>are</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> changing city where the economic boom has passed them by.

2500|$|In a November 2015 interview, Sundfør {{stated that}} {{she was working on}} the album, calling it [...] "very cosmic" [...] and added {{that a lot of the}} {{inspiration}} for it came from reading the book A Universe from Nothing. The album was mainly inspired by a journey Sundfør made, [...] "travelling across continents to contrary environments and politically contrasting worlds from North Korea to the Amazon jungle." [...] She stated: [...] " [...] made me focus on something other than myself; it made me curious and hungry for new impressions and new motives for my photography. It's hard to pinpoint exactly how it affected my music, but all experiences are potentially inspiring for creativity. I didn't travel to write; I traveled to take pictures, which to me is an important part of the album. that emptiness is the place where things start to grow. Most of the universe is empty. So, I'm not afraid of that anymore." [...] She said the album is about how [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> time of great changes. Everything is moving so rapidly, sometimes violently, sometimes dauntingly. I think a lot of people experience anxiety these days. I wanted to address these emotions on the album." [...] She also cited American poet Robert Bly's 1980 anthology News of the Universe as one of the album's inspirations.|$|E

2500|$|More {{than one}} in every six {{people in the world}} is water stressed, meaning {{that they do not have}} {{sufficient}} access to potable water. Those that are water stressed make up 1.1 billion people in the world and are living in developing countries. According to the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator, a country or region is said to experience [...] "water stress" [...] when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic metres per person per year. At levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, periodic or limited water shortages can be expected. When a country is below 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, the country then faces water scarcity [...] In 2006, about 700 million people in 43 countries were living below the 1,700 cubic metres per person threshold. Water stress is ever intensifying in regions such as China, India, and Sub-Saharan Africa, which contains the largest number of water stressed countries of any region with almost one fourth of the population living in a water stressed country. The world's most water stressed region is the Middle East with averages of 1,200 cubic metres of water per person. In China, more than 538 million people <b>are</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> water-stressed region. Much of the water stressed population currently live in river basins where the usage of water resources greatly exceed the renewal of the water source.|$|E
