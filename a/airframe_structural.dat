40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the application of}} a formal optimization technique in rotorcraft <b>airframe</b> <b>structural</b> design studies to reduce the structural weight, to lower airframe vibrations, and to enhance fatigue life of the structure.

The paper focuses on the development of necessary computational tools for <b>airframe</b> <b>structural</b> optimization and describes the sensitivity analysis procedure for these types of design constraints. Further, the paper describes the optimization procedure as implemented in a computer code called DYNOPT which is a unique operational combination of several newly developed Fortran codes as well as modification of existing codes consisting of the direct matrix abstraction modules of the MSC/NASTRAN Program and CONMIN optimizer.
