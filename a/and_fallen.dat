Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz took his 38 squadrons of cavalry {{and moved toward}} the Janus and Pölzen, small hills between Rossbach and Reichertswerben. Except for a few moments, the advance was hidden entirely from view. He was followed by Colonel Karl Friedrich von Moller's battery of 18 guns, which positioned themselves temporarily on the reverse of the Janus between the infantry's left and the cavalry's right. Seven squadrons remained in Rossbach to contain Saint-Germain's advanced post.|$|E
5|$|High surf also {{occurred}} {{along the southern}} coast of Massachusetts, prompting {{the closing of the}} ferry between Nantucket and Boston. Beryl produced a storm surge of 0.9feet (.27m) on Nantucket. Winds across southeastern Massachusetts were fairly light, with no sustained tropical storm force winds and wind gusts peaking at 44mph (71km/h); unofficially gusts reached 51mph (82km/h). Beryl dropped moderate precipitation just offshore, though the maximum precipitation total in the United States was only 0.97inches (24.6mm) on Nantucket. Rainfall along southeastern Massachusetts reached 0.33inches (8.38mm) at Chatham. The only reported damage were some downed telephone poles <b>and</b> <b>fallen</b> tree branches. Overall impact was minor; there were no reported power outages, deaths, injuries, or maritime emergencies in association with the storm.|$|E

5|$|Insect ecology is the {{scientific}} study of how insects, individually or as a community, interact with the surrounding environment or ecosystem. Insects play {{one of the most important}} roles in their ecosystems, which includes many roles, such as soil turning and aeration, dung burial, pest control, pollination and wildlife nutrition. An example is the beetles, which are scavengers that feed on dead animals <b>and</b> <b>fallen</b> trees and thereby recycle biological materials into forms found useful by other organisms. These insects, and others, are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created.|$|E
5|$|Most earwigs are nocturnal and inhabit small crevices, {{living in}} small amounts of debris, in various forms such as bark <b>and</b> <b>fallen</b> logs. Species {{have been found to}} be blind and living in caves, or cavernicolous; {{reported}} to be found on the island of Hawaii and in South Africa. Food typically consist of a wide array of living and dead plant and animal matter. For protection from predators, the species Doru taeniatum of earwigs can squirt foul-smelling yellow liquid in the form of jets from scent glands on the dorsal side of the third and fourth abdominal segment. It aims the discharges by revolving the abdomen, a maneuver that enables it simultaneously to use its pincers in defense.|$|E
5|$|Snow {{develops}} in clouds that themselves {{are part of}} a larger weather system. The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling <b>and</b> <b>fallen</b> crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations, thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.|$|E

5|$|The {{branches}} of the silver birch often have tangled masses of twigs known as witch's brooms growing among them, caused by the fungus Taphrina betulina. Old trees are often killed by the decay fungus Piptoporus betulinus <b>and</b> <b>fallen</b> branches rot rapidly on the forest floor. This tree commonly grows with the mycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria in a mutualistic relationship. This applies particularly to acidic or nutrient-poor soils. Other mycorrhizal associates include Leccinum scabrum and Cantharellus cibarius. It has been shown that, as well as mycorrhiza, the presence of microfauna in the soil assists {{the growth of the}} tree, as it enhances the mobilization of nutrients.|$|E

Together with the woodland creatures, they keep watch over her. A year later, a prince, who had previously met <b>and</b> <b>fallen</b> in love with Snow White, learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes Snow White to his castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} David C. Large wrote that, {{like any}} public pronouncements, these bylaws {{did not tell}} the full story about HIAG's real goals.

For example, HIAG claimed to represent the entire Waffen-SS membership, surviving <b>and</b> <b>fallen,</b> as well as their families: 500,000 in total. In reality, the organisation's rolls did not exceed 20,000. HIAG attained this number in the late 1950s, and held it until the early 1960s.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the relationship between falls efficacy, perception of <b>fall</b> risk <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> prevention behavior in frail elderly. The data was collected from 300 elderly through the questionnaire. 1) the mean score of fall efficacy was 34. 3 ± 11. 5, perception of fall risk was 34. 3 ± 11. 5, <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> prevention behavior was 17. 7 ± 2. 75. 2) Fall efficacy was significantly different according to falls experience(t= 2. 905, p<. 05). Perception of fall risk was significantly different according to falls experience (t= 2. 704, p<. 05) <b>and</b> <b>Fall</b> prevention behavior was significantly different according to falls experience (t= 2. 706, p<. 05). 3) It showed the negative relation between <b>fall</b> efficacy <b>and</b> perception of <b>fall</b> risk.

5|$|Almost 35,000 South Australians {{served in}} the First World War. This number {{amounted}} to 8.5% of the South Australian population at the time, or 37.7% of men {{between the ages of}} 18 and 44. Of those who served, over 5,000 South Australians died. In response to these deaths, Archibald Peake, the premier of South Australia, asked the state parliament to fund a memorial commemorating the victory and the sacrifice of those who had fought <b>and</b> <b>fallen.</b> The motion was presented in March 1919, and it received unanimous support in the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council. With the passing of this motion, the South Australian Government became the first in Australia to elect to build a memorial to the soldiers of the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 7th {{millennium}} BCE, {{human populations}} {{moved into the}} Chadian basin in great numbers. By {{the end of the}} 1st millennium AD, a series of states and empires had risen <b>and</b> <b>fallen</b> in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region. France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of François Tombalbaye. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965. In 1979 the rebels conquered the capital {{and put an end to}} the south's hegemony. However, the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until Hissène Habré defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general Idriss Déby. Since 2003 the Darfur crisis in Sudan has spilt over the border and destabilised the nation, with hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees living in and around camps in eastern Chad. Unsustainable high birth rates and a lack of agriculture let the country persist in poverty.|$|E
5|$|Ireland's {{geologic}} history covers {{everything from}} volcanism and tropical seas {{to the last}} glacial period. Ireland was formed in two distinct parts and slowly joined together, uniting about 440 million years ago. As a result of tectonics {{and the effect of}} ice, the sea level has risen <b>and</b> <b>fallen.</b> In every area of the country the rocks which formed {{can be seen as a}} result. Finally, the impact of the glaciers shaped the landscape seen today. This variation in the two areas along with the differences between volcanic areas and shallow seas gives Ireland a range of soils as well. There are wide bogs and free-draining brown earths. The mountains are granite, sandstone, limestone with karst areas, and basalt formations.|$|E

5|$|Jackie Chan was the stunt {{director}} of Rob-B-Hood, having choreographed all the stunts with the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. He continued his tradition of performing his own stunts in the film, for example, jumping between several air-conditioners {{on the outer}} wall of a tall building to reach the ground. Several scenes required Chan to co-ordinate his stunts with the baby, including a car chase around the Sha Tin industrial area, in which he managed to snatch the baby away seconds before a car crashed into him; and a scene in Ocean Park in which he climbed {{on the underside of}} a roller coaster with the baby in hand. Chan suffered minor injuries attempting stunts in the film, having been kicked in the chest by a stuntman wearing the wrong boots <b>and</b> <b>fallen</b> off a quad bike, while attempting to perform a wheelie. Chan's combat choreography included the use of improvised weapons in combat; when he fought a pair of skilled henchmen in a deep freeze room, he defeated them by spraying them with milk and then using a large fan to blast them with cold air.|$|E
5|$|Less {{is known}} of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the {{historical}} Stefan Lochner believe {{he was born in}} Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major city occasion. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances <b>and</b> <b>fallen</b> into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40.|$|E
5|$|Power outages {{affected}} Metro Manila, {{and several}} billboards were damaged in the city, {{although there was}} minimal flooding in the capital. Adverse conditions caused the Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1 to close for two hours, stranding hundreds. High winds knocked over a 12m (40ft) tree that killed five on Romblon Island. The rains brought the Magat Dam on Luzon to capacity. Landslides blocked a national highway in Nueva Ecija with debris <b>and</b> <b>fallen</b> trees, which were quickly cleared within a few days. On Mindanao, flash flooding from the outer periphery of the storm affected 18towns, killing 11people. In Maguindanao in the southern Philippines, flooding washed away 50houses, forcing over 2,000people to evacuate. Damage extended {{as far south as}} the Western Visayas. Across the Philippines, Imbudo damaged 62,314houses, of which about 20% were destroyed. Housing damage was estimated at P1.2billion (PHP, $22million USD), most of which in the Cagayan Valley. Overall damage in the country was estimated at about P4.7billion (PHP, $86million USD). Of the total, about P1.9billion (PHP, $35million USD) was in agriculture damage. Imbudo killed 64people in the Philippines, mostly in Cagayan Valley, and injured another 154.|$|E
