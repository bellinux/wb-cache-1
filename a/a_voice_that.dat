5|$|In {{a parody}} of Dexter, after hearing <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> he thinks is God telling him to murder people, Ned Flanders becomes a serial killing vigilante, {{targeting}} characters who are Homer's enemies. When Flanders discovers that Homer {{is the one who}} has been duping him into committing murder (by way of a Bible-shaped receiver), Homer argues that God does not exist and starts burning Ned's bible, only to be stopped and strangled to death by God Himself. Marge begs God to reverse everything that has happened, but God tells her that Satan is the one who is running the world. When Flanders thinks that this scenario cannot get any worse, it is revealed that Satan is sleeping with Ned's deceased wife, Maude.|$|E

25|$|Frederick Busch {{asserts that}} Mailer has created <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> speaks about Sam, {{and it might}} also {{represent}} Mailer in some ways. The problem, states Busch, is Mailer wants to speak about his own difficulties writing, but needs to objectify his voice {{in order to create}} fiction and not autobiography. Thus, he not only analyzes the characters' feelings, but also his own.|$|E
25|$|Of {{her many}} recordings, the {{complete}} Tristan und Isolde with Furtwängler {{is considered the}} finest representation of her interpretive art in its maturity. It {{is widely regarded as}} one of the greatest recordings of all time. Throughout her career she recorded numerous songs, by Grieg and others, and these are evidence of <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> maintained its stable beauty during her many years in the limelight. A comprehensive survey of her recordings was released in several volumes on the Simax label.|$|E
25|$|John Coates (29 June 1865 – 16 August 1941) was {{a leading}} English tenor, who sang in opera and oratorio and on the concert platform. His {{repertoire}} ranged from Bach and Purcell to contemporary works, and embraced the major heldentenor roles in Richard Wagner's operas. For more than 40 years, with only a four-year interruption for military service during World War I, he overcame the limitations of <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> was not naturally large by impressing listeners with his intense artistic expression, lively diction, musical versatility and memorable stage presence.|$|E

25|$|One {{must not}} mistake the Mozartian {{dramatic}} coloratura soprano with the Italian dramatic coloratura soprano. A singer that sings Konstanze, Donna Anna or Fiordiligi can not necessarily sing the Italian dramatic coloratura parts, due to other vocal demands. Imogene, Leonora and Violetta require a dramatic soprano voice and {{are most often}} sung by dramatic sopranos with an agile voice that can easily produce coloratura and high notes. Roles like Norma, Lady Macbeth, Odabella or Abigaille are good examples of Italian roles that are not necessarily a coloratura soprano (even though the score calls for coloratura singing), but a full bodied dramatic soprano with <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> can handle extreme dramatic singing and that is flexible enough to sing coloratura. Giuseppe Verdi wrote many parts like this in his early years.|$|E

With <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> St. John's-based newspaper The Telegram has described as [...] "powerful yet serene and soulful", she has been nominated for awards at the annual MusicNL awards in Newfoundland, {{as well as at}} the Juno Awards, Canada's top music prizes.|$|E

500|$|Lovato {{is a full}} lyric soprano. She has a vocal {{range of}} four octaves, 1 note and a semitone, {{including}} the whistle register. Nick Levine of Digital Spy, commenting on her vocals for her album, Don't Forget, stated, [...] "she's certainly a stronger singer than the Jonases. In fact, her full-bodied vocal performances are consistently impressive." [...] Becky Brain of Idolator wrote that Lovato has a [...] "killer voice and the A-list material to put it to good use." [...] According to Sophie Schillaci of The Hollywood Reporter, the entertainer [...] "has <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> can silence even the harshest of critics.

Shortly after, the website was replaced with a [...] "message" [...] from Zod, who requested that Earth must return Kal-El to his custody and told Kal-El to surrender within 24 hours or the world would suffer the consequences. A viral site called [...] "IWillFindHim.com" [...] was released that showed a countdown to the third trailer for the film.|$|E
500|$|Twice Through the Heart {{lasts for}} {{approximately}} 30 minutes. It consists of nine musical numbers arranged in three sections. It is narrated {{by a woman}} in the prison cell where she has been sent for the murder of her husband. To express the woman's feelings, Kay deliberately chose <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> was unpoetic: [...] "I wanted the voice to be so everyday, it would be banal." [...] Turnage's music too includes similarly basic material, what critic Tom Service describes as [...] "simple hummable tunes", but these are transformed and distorted, a metaphor for how initial loving intimacy is destroyed and distorted by years of violence and abuse. Turnage's musical language is modernist but influenced by jazz, an area of musical interest he shared with Kay.|$|E

500|$|In her {{performance}} it's always {{clear that a}} finely tuned engine is at work, but what was refreshing here {{was that it was}} in service of a surprisingly casual manner. She made funny, exaggerated faces; twirled her hair (when it was not floating); and spoke to the crowd like a knowing buddy. She was working off a teleprompter for her between-song patter, but improvising frequently, and for the better ... Beyoncé persevere, with <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> skips up octaves and still gains power, with words that are as compelling as they are straightforward, with legs that treat the stage floor like an enemy in need of a thorough stomping.

500|$|The Duke spent William's {{reign in}} the House of Lords, {{where he was}} assiduous in his attendance. Wrote {{newspaper}} editor James Grant, [...] "He is literally—the door-keeper of course excepted—the first man in the House, and the last out of it. And this not merely generally, but every night." [...] Grant, in his observations of the leading members of the House of Lords, indicated that the Duke was not noted for his oratory (he delivered no speech longer than five minutes) and had <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> was difficult to understand, though, [...] "his manner is most mild and conciliatory." [...] Grant denigrated the Duke's intellect and influence, but stated that the Duke had indirect influence over several members, and that, [...] "he {{is by no means}} so bad a tactician as his opponents suppose." ...|$|E
500|$|In his biographical sketch for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Philip Williamson depicts Bondfield as [...] "physically {{short and}} stout... with {{sparkling}} eyes, a firm, brisk manner, and effective, sometimes inspired, public speaking". She had the self-confidence to exist and thrive in a male-dominated world, deriving inspiration from a childhood that, though materially impoverished, her obituarist has described as [...] "of great spiritual and mental wealth". She inherited a strong nonconformist faith, {{which became a}} key element throughout her later career, and retained her links with the Congregational Church throughout her life. After her death The Times praised her [...] "unusually wide human sympathies... her generous nature and real sense of humour". Skidelsky, however, describes her unsympathetically as [...] "a humourless and somewhat priggish person, with long black skirts and <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> emitted a harsh cascade of sound".|$|E

500|$|Writing for Game Informer, Andrew Reiner {{said that}} the game's {{interactive}} storytelling encourages replay and that its detailed story [...] "makes the relationships feel real—you care about your crew, and you really {{feel like you have}} <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> resonates throughout the galaxy." [...] Alex Dale of CVG stated similar pros, stating that [...] "never before has storytelling been so competently ingrained into a videogame, and never before has a player had so much freedom to dictate the course of a linear storyline." [...] Similar praise was given to the game's detailed character models, facial animations, and voice acting. Jennifer Tsao of 1UP.com felt the digital actors evoked real-life expressions, but admitted that the lip sync had some issues. Although the visuals were credited for their dramatic set pieces and evocative soundtrack, critics noted the game's inconsistent frame rate and long loading times.|$|E
500|$|In March 2010, Nesbitt {{accepted}} the ceremonial position of Chancellor of the University of Ulster, succeeding former Lord Mayor of London Sir Richard Nichols. Gerry Mallon, then-chair {{of the university}} ruling council, expected Nesbitt to [...] "bring considerable energy, dynamism and commitment" [...] to the post. Following his official installation on 8 June 2010, Nesbitt said, [...] "Rather than being just an informal role officiating at ceremonies, I think I can act as an ambassador. I have access to {{an awful lot of}} people and places because of my work. I hope to be <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> can be heard, not just at the university, but also outside promoting the importance of the funding of education. If that involves me being at Stormont, then I'd be very happy to do that. Clearly these public spending cuts are going to have an impact and it's important to fight for funding because it's about investing in students and investing in the future of Northern Ireland. I believe I can bring something to that, otherwise I wouldn't have taken this on." ...|$|E
500|$|Jamieson Cox, from Time, {{wrote that}} [...] "if {{you needed a}} {{reminder}} of just how thoroughly Mariah Carey dominated the 90s, or a refresher on the staggering force of the numbers she’s put up throughout her career, #1 To Infinity will do just fine", but also pointing out {{that most of the}} songs were released from 1990 to 1995, just 20% of Carey's entire recording career, as well as criticizing the lack of material released from 2005 onwards; [...] "in 2015, we’re as far away from 'We Belong Together' as that song was from 'Fantasy', and that lost decade is the root of this compilation’s greatest tragedy [...] the great majority of the fine work Carey’s done in the last decade might as well not exist". Nonetheless, he praised the compilation for highlighting [...] "the sheer athleticism and skill that propelled Carey’s early work. She took very simple songs—both in terms of arrangements and theme—rooted in pop, gospel, and R and turned them into feats of strength, granting them dynamism and drama with <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> juggled power, clarity, and agility with ease".|$|E
