40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the {{prevalence}} of abnormal cholesterol in children, <b>adolescent</b> <b>and</b> adults in the United States. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination survey (NHANES) for 2011 - 2014 were obtained for the comparison. A t test statistical analysis was conducted at a significant level of p< 0. 05 to check for differences in the groups. The results of high total cholesterol and low high density lipoprotein (HDL) were compared in children, <b>adolescent</b> <b>and</b> adults according to race, sex and ethnicity. A total of 27. 9 % of men had low level of HDL cholesterol, 10 % of women had low HDL, 13. 4 % of children <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> had low level of HDL. Boys had low HDL (14. 8 %) while girls had 12 %. The non-Hispanic black adults with elevated total high cholesterol was 8. 6 %, non-Hispanic white (12. 5 %), Hispanic adults (13. 1 %) while non-Hispanic black children <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> had elevated total high cholesterol, the non-Hispanic white <b>and</b> Hispanic <b>adolescent</b> <b>and</b> children had low total high cholesterol. The level of low HDL cholesterol was higher in children, <b>adolescent</b> <b>and</b> adult male population, the high total cholesterol was higher in the female children, <b>adolescent</b> <b>and</b> adults...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} whether age, {{best friend}} delinquency, <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> self-concept clarity {{were related to}} adolescents’ delinquency, and whether age and self-concept clarity moderated the relation between <b>adolescent</b> <b>and</b> best friend delinquency. Dutch adolescents (N = 497, Mage Wave 1 = 13 years, 287 boys) and their best friends participated across six waves, reporting annually on <b>adolescent</b> <b>and</b> best friend delinquency, <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> self-concept clarity. Adolescent delinquency linearly declined, and whereas adolescents’ and best friends' delinquency levels were related, developmental change in delinquency was not. Self-concept clarity significantly affected delinquency development between ages 16 - 18. Age and self-concept clarity did not significantly moderate the relation between <b>adolescent</b> <b>and</b> best friend delinquency, and thus did not affect adolescent susceptibility to best friend influence...|$|R

5|$|Painful {{cramping}} in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs {{is common}} {{during the first}} few days of menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as dysmenorrhea, and it is most common among <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females). When menstruation begins, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) such as breast tenderness and irritability generally decrease. Many sanitary products are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization, the European Union {{and other}} {{regional}} bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies {{in order to}} reduce the harm of alcoholism. Targeting <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, evidence based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst <b>adolescents,</b> <b>and</b> for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.|$|E

5|$|Suicidal {{thoughts}} and behaviors are rare in clinical trials, and the FDA requires all antidepressants, including bupropion, {{to carry a}} boxed warning stating that antidepressants may {{increase the risk of}} suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA which found a 2-fold increase in suicidal thought and behavior in children and <b>adolescents,</b> <b>and</b> 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group. For this analysis the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants in order to obtain statistically significant results. Considered in isolation, bupropion was not statistically different from placebo.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventional}} {{level of}} moral reasoning {{is typical of}} <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of {{the third and fourth}} stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of AS {{is complicated by}} the use of several different screening instruments, including the Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale (ASDS), Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), Childhood Autism Spectrum Test (CAST) (previously called the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test), Gilliam Asperger's disorder scale (GADS), Krug Asperger's Disorder Index (KADI), and the Autism-spectrum quotient (AQ; with versions for children, <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> adults). None have been shown to reliably differentiate between AS and other ASDs.|$|E

40|$|The {{treatment}} of <b>Adolescent</b> <b>and</b> Young Adult Oncology patients requires a comprehensive {{understanding of the}} psychological and social complexity of this group. Psychosocial support is often coupled with clinical treatment, {{but there are still}} unmet needs within this population regarding relevant information, mental health counseling, practical resources, and others. A significant gap in available clinical trials and participation in clinical trials has prevented progress in clinical {{treatment of}} <b>Adolescent</b> <b>and</b> Young Adults with cancer. A review of pertinent literature on psychosocial needs and oncology clinical trials was conducted in order to examine any relationship between unmet needs and clinical trial participation. <b>Adolescent</b> <b>and</b> Young Adults with cancer who have symptoms of unmet psychosocial needs experience a lower participation rate of clinical trials. This suggests that an increase in available psychosocial resources and delivery of these resources to patients will increase clinical trial participation, furthering the clinical treatment capabilities of <b>Adolescent</b> <b>and</b> Young Adult Oncologists and increasing survival rates...|$|R

5|$|The drug label advises that {{bupropion}} {{should not}} be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, active brain tumors, or concurrent alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use and/or withdrawal. It should be avoided in individuals who are also taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). When switching from MAOIs to bupropion, {{it is important to}} include a washout period of about two weeks between the medications. The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet reduces seizure frequency by {{more than}} 50% in half of the patients who try it and {{by more than}} 90% in a third of patients. Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though experts recommend a trial {{of at least three}} months before assuming it has been ineffective. Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to benefit from the ketogenic diet than from trying another anticonvulsant drug. There is some evidence that <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> adults may also benefit from the diet.|$|E

Figures for the population by age showed 24.6% were children younger than 10 years old; 21.1% were <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> young men between 11 and 20; 32.9% were adults between 21 and 40; 8.4% were between 41 and 50; 12.8% were between 51 and 70; and lastly, only 3.4% were over 71. The residents in the combined northeast and southeast regions comprised 87.2% of the nation's population.

5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., acting-out disorders) show {{a clearer}} link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents, as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification, and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E
5|$|In many {{countries}} {{the rate of}} suicide is highest in the middle-aged or elderly. The absolute number of suicides however is greatest in those between 15 and 29 years old due {{to the number of}} people in this age group.

It is the second most common cause of death in <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> in young males is second only to accidental death. In young males in the developed world it is the cause of nearly 30% of mortality. In the developing world rates are similar, but it makes up a smaller proportion of overall deaths due to higher rates of death from other types of trauma. In South-East Asia in contrast to other areas of the world, deaths from suicide occur at a greater rate in young females than elderly females.|$|E
