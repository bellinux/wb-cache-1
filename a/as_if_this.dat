5|$|Because {{of the low}} wage at América Mineiro, he {{was forced}} to quit {{football}} to take various jobs as a labourer, a carpenter, and a worker in a sweet factory. It looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> {{would be the end of}} his childhood dream. As a factory-worker Gilberto earned the equivalent of about £50 a month by 2002 rates. After three years of working in a factory, the 18-year-old decided to try his luck at football again by enrolling in the local club's youth academy. His time in the academy did not last long due to the worsening situation at home as a result of his mother's ill health; he returned to work in the sweet factory with little hope of resurrecting his football career.|$|E

DRG ignored the music's connection to the film by altering the title and putting a shot of Bublé on the cover, making it appear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> was a proper Michael Bublé release. The slight misrepresentation was not lost on Bublé, who stated on his website {{that he did not want}} these songs released but that it was out of his control.|$|E

The upgrades Include the new fire control system Fotona EFCS-3B (with laser rangefinder, cross-wind sensor, ballistic computer and gunner's passive night vision device), a 105mm tank gun, side skirts, smoke grenade launchers, ERA package, a new power-pack with 780hp 12-cylinder V-46-6 diesel engine and new tracks.

25|$|Empedocles {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} separation of elements, the formation of earth and sea, of Sun and Moon, of atmosphere. He also dealt with the first origin of plants and animals, and with the physiology of humans. As the elements entered into combinations, there appeared strange results– heads without necks, arms without shoulders. Then as these fragmentary structures met, there were seen horned heads on human bodies, bodies of oxen with human heads, and figures of double sex. But most of these products of natural forces disappeared as suddenly as they arose; only in those rare cases where the parts {{were found to be}} adapted to each other did the complex structures last. Thus the organic universe sprang from spontaneous aggregations that suited each other <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> had been intended. Soon various influences reduced creatures of double sex to a male and a female, and the world was replenished with organic life. It is possible to see this theory as an anticipation of Darwin's theory of natural selection, although Empedocles was not trying to explain evolution.|$|E
25|$|By February 638 {{there was}} a lull in the {{fighting}} on the Persian front. The Suwad, the Tigris valley, and the Euphrates valley were now under the complete control of the Muslims. The Persians had withdrawn to Persia proper, east of the Zagros mountains. The Persians continued raiding Mesopotamia, which remained politically unstable. Nevertheless, it appeared <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> {{was going to be}} the dividing line between the Rashidun Caliphate and the Sassanids. In the later part of the year 638 Hormuzan, who commanded one of the Persian corps at the Battle of Qadisiyyah and was one of the seven great chiefs of Persia, intensified his raids in Mesopotamia, Saad according to Umar's instructions undertook offensive actions against Hormuzan and Utbah ibn Ghazwan aided by Nouman ibn Muqarin attacked Ahvaz and forced Hormuzan to enter into a peace treaty with the Muslims according to which Ahvaz would remain in Hormuzan's possession and he would rule it as a vassal of the Muslims and would pay tribute. Hormuzan broke the treaty and revolted against the Muslims. Umar sent Abu Musa Ashaari, governor of Busra to deal with Hormuzan. Hormuzan was defeated and sought once again for peace. Umar accepted the offer and Hormuzan was again made vassal of the Muslims. This peace also proved short-lived once Hormuzan was reinforced by the fresh Persian troops sent by Emperor Yazdgerd III in late 640. The troops concentrated at Tuster north of Ahvaz. Umar sent Governor of Kufa, Ammar ibn Yasir, governor of Busra Abu Musa, and Nouman ibn Muqarin towards Tustar where Hormuzan was defeated, captured and sent to Madinah to Caliph Umar, where he apparently converted to Islam. He remained a useful adviser of Umar throughout the campaign of conquest of Persia. He is also considered to be the mastermind behind the assassination of Caliph Umar in 644. After the victory at Tustar, Abu Musa marched against Susa, a place of military importance, in January 641, which was captured after a siege of a couple of months. Next Abu Musa marched against Junde Sabur, the only place left of military importance in the Persian province of Khuzistan which surrendered to the Muslims after a siege of a few weeks.|$|E

When he meets Squidward at the restaurant, SpongeBob acts <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> is his first time applying at the Krusty Krab and has never met Squidward before. Squidward decides to take advantage of this by training SpongeBob to act like him, a horrible employee, in hopes SpongeBob will later get fired. After a series of complaints from the customers, Mr. Krabs confronts SpongeBob for his lousy work, to which SpongeBob explains since he has new pants, he is no longer [...] "SpongeBob SquarePants". Mr. Krabs then convinces SpongeBob he should take his pants off then. SpongeBob, no longer wearing pants, then continues to be his normal self and go back to being a good employee.

He is now a different person, a Malaysian, but a Malay Malaysian whose authority in Malaya — his land — is now not only shared with others, but shared unequally. And <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> is not enough, he is being asked to give up {{more and more of}} his share of influence." [...] Mahathir's defence of Malay rights focused both on the [...] "definitive people" [...] line of reasoning and the argument in favour of affirmative action, which the Reid Commission had chosen: [...] "It is not... for reasons of Malay superiority that preferential treatment for Malays in scholarship awards was insisted upon. ... They are a means of breaking down the superior position of the non-Malays in the field of education. The Malays are not proud of this treatment."

500|$|Contemporary {{critic and}} editor Margaret Fuller wrote, [...] "his verse is stereotyped; his thought sounds no depth, and posterity will not {{remember}} him." [...] Duyckinck thought Lowell was too {{similar to other}} poets like William Shakespeare and John Milton. Ralph Waldo Emerson noted that, though Lowell had significant technical skill, his poetry [...] "rather expresses his wish, his ambition, than the uncontrollable interior impulse which is the authentic mark of a new poem... and which is felt in the pervading tone, rather than in brilliant parts or lines." [...] Even his friend Richard Henry Dana Jr. questioned Lowell's abilities, calling him [...] "very clever, entertaining & good humored... but he is rather a trifler, after all." [...] In the twentieth century, poet Richard Armour dismissed Lowell, writing: [...] "As a Harvard graduate and an editor for the Atlantic Monthly, {{it must have been}} difficult for Lowell to write like an illiterate oaf, but he succeeded." [...] The poet Amy Lowell featured her relative James Russell Lowell in her poem A Critical Fable (1922), the title mocking A Fable for Critics. Here, a fictional version of Lowell says he does not believe that women will ever be equal to men in the arts and [...] "the two sexes cannot be ranked counterparts". Modern literary critic Van Wyck Brooks wrote that Lowell's poetry was forgettable: [...] "one read them five times over and still forgot them, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> excellent verse had been written in water." [...] Nonetheless, in 1969 the Modern Language Association established a prize named after Lowell, awarded annually for [...] "an outstanding literary or linguistic study, a critical edition of an important work, or a critical biography." ...|$|E

Move... reveals that much, as it finds the group embracing, hopefully definitively, that midpoint between spiritual fervor and Southern rock passion that suits them so well". Chris Carpenter of cbnmusic.com gave it four-and-a-half out of five stars, opining that [...] "The charismatic [...] Powell, along with guitarist Mark Lee, bassist Tai Anderson, and drummer David Carr, have crafted a project that is as musically stimulating as it is lyrically diverse... It's raw, passionate, and track after track is filled with uncompromising truth". Andy Argyrakis of CCM Magazine gave Move three out of five stars, noting an overall southern rock sound to the album and saying that it [...] "recalls 1999's treasured Time". C. E'Jon Moore of The Christian Manifesto gave the album three out of five stars, saying [...] "In the end, Move is a good album. It’s not a great album... Some will feel it’s a progression, but I really feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> is more of the same from a band who has proven that they are capable of giving us more than the status quo".
