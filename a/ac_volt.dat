5000|$|In November 1885 {{electrical}} engineer William Stanley, Jr., a sometimes Great Barrington resident working for George Westinghouse, began installing a demonstration transformer based alternating current lighting system. Stanley felt AC was {{an improvement over}} the direct current system being used by Thomas Edison, and Stanley {{was trying to get}} Westinghouse to adopt it. Stanley had developed a series transformer that he thought would make AC practical. He built his components at the [...] "Old Rubber Factory" [...] south of Cottage Street and installed a Westinghouse steam engine powering a 500 volt Siemens generator. Stringing the power lines from tree to tree down the street, in March 1886 Stanley powered the system up and was able to expand it {{to the point where it}} could light 23 businesses along Main Street with very little power loss over 4000 feet. The system's 500 <b>AC</b> <b>volt</b> current was stepped down to 100 volts using the new Stanley transformer to power incandescent lamps at each location. This was the world's first practical demonstration of a transformer/alternating current system and the basis of the AC systems that Westinghouse would begin installing later that year.|$|E
