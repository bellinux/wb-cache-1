5|$|York-born William Etty (1787–1849) had {{originally}} been an apprentice printer in Hull, but on completing his apprenticeship {{at the age of}} 18 moved to London to become an artist. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. While many of his peers greatly admired him and elected him a full Royal <b>Academician</b> in 1828, others condemned the content of his work as indecent.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of The Combat, Etty {{continued}} with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal <b>Academician</b> in 1828, {{at that time the}} most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.|$|E

5|$|During {{his life}} Etty had {{acquired}} followers such as Irish painters William Mulready and Daniel Maclise, but both rejected Etty's preoccupation with nudes. Mulready painted nudes but became {{best known for}} domestic genre paintings, while Maclise chose to specialise in more traditional history paintings and exhibited only one nude work in his career. One of the few painters who consciously attempted to continue Etty's style after his death was William Edward Frost, who had been an acquaintance of Etty's since 1825. In the early 1830s Frost painted on commission for Thomas Potts (whose 1833 commission of Etty to paint his daughter Elizabeth's portrait had been Etty's first significant portrait commission), and later was commissioned on Etty's recommendation to paint a portrait of Etty's cousin Thomas Bodley. Frost successfully imitated Etty throughout his career, {{to the extent that}} his figure studies and Etty's are often misattributed to each other. Although Frost eventually became a Royal <b>Academician</b> in 1870, by this time Etty's style of painting had badly fallen out of fashion.|$|E
5|$|Etty's Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia, {{painted in}} 1821, {{featured}} numerous nudes and was exhibited to great acclaim. Its success prompted several further depictions of historical scenes with nudes. All {{but one of}} the works he exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s contained at least one nude figure, and he acquired a reputation for indecency. Despite this, he was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, and in 1828 was elected a Royal <b>Academician,</b> at the time the highest honour available to an artist. Although {{he was one of the}} most respected artists in the country he continued to study at life classes throughout his life, a practice considered inappropriate by his fellow artists. In the 1830s Etty began to branch out into the more lucrative but less respected field of portraiture, and later became the first English painter to paint significant still lifes. He continued to paint both male and female nudes, which caused severe criticism and condemnation from some elements of the press.|$|E
5|$|In 1843 he {{travelled}} to Italy {{where he}} remained for four years. On {{his return to}} London he suffered from depression and painted a number of notably gloomy works.

In 1867 he was elected a Royal <b>Academician,</b> {{at the time the}} highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with the culture of the Royal Academy. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, {{he was one of the}} most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame. In 1884 a selection of 50 of his works was shown at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.|$|E
