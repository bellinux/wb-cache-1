25|$|This is the recursion-theoretic {{branch of}} {{learning}} theory. It {{is based on}} Gold's model of learning in the limit from 1967 and has developed since then more and more models of learning. The general scenario is the following: Given a class S of computable functions, is there <b>a</b> <b>learner</b> (that is, recursive functional) which outputs for any input of the form (f(0),f(1),...,f(n)) a hypothesis. <b>A</b> <b>learner</b> M learns a function f if almost all hypotheses are the same index e of f {{with respect to a}} previously agreed on acceptable numbering of all computable functions; M learns S if M learns every f in S. Basic results are that all recursively enumerable classes of functions are learnable while the class REC of all computable functions is not learnable. Many related models have been considered and also the learning of classes of recursively enumerable sets from positive data is a topic studied from Gold's pioneering paper in 1967 onwards.|$|E

To ensure the measurement is not affected even if the user switches between tasks, three preliminary research experiments were carried out based on three common tasks during e-learning − search, assessment and typing. A stress measurement model was then built using the datasets collected from the experiments. Three stress classifiers were tested, namely certainty factors, feedforward back-propagation neural network and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. The best classifier was then integrated into the ITS stress inference engine, which is designed to decide necessary adaptation, and to provide analytical information of learners' performances, which include stress levels and learners’ behaviours when answering questions...|$|R

25|$|Most social constructivist models, {{such as that}} {{proposed}} by Duffy and Jonassen (1992), also stress the need for collaboration among learners, in direct contradiction to traditional competitive approaches.

Detecting <b>a</b> <b>learner’s</b> emotional reaction for a given situation is an essential element for every Distant Learning Environment. Nevertheless, inferring <b>a</b> <b>learner’s</b> emotional reaction in those environments is not a trivial task. In this paper, we present an agent capable of predicting <b>a</b> <b>learner’s</b> emotional reaction in a distant learning environment based on the learner’s personal and non-personal traits using a machine learning technique, namely the ID 3 algorithm. We then describe the agent’s method for predicting the learner’s emotional reaction and discuss the obtained results. ...|$|R

2500|$|Today, the retrieval-failure hypothesis, {{concerning}} {{the function of}} the memory, is more widely accepted and popularized (Schöpper-Grabe 1998:237). It says that the storage of information happens on different levels. Therefore, information or memory is not deleted, but rather, the access to the current level is blocked. Thus, the information is not available. Hansen quotes Loftus & Loftus (1976) to describe forgetting: [...] " [...] much like being unable to find something that we have misplaced somewhere" [...] (1999: 10). Cohen states, evidence for knowing that <b>a</b> <b>learner</b> is not able to [...] "find" [...] something, is the use of the so-called progressive retrieval (1986). Thereby, the learner is unable to express something that is in his mind and consequently uses an incorrect form. He eventually remembers the correct one (Cohen 1986; Olshtain 1989). Time is considered the decisive factor to measure how far the attrition has proceeded already (de Bot & Weltens, 1995).|$|E

2500|$|This term 'scaffolding' is {{a useful}} metaphor {{that is used to}} symbolise the process of {{supporting}} <b>a</b> <b>learner</b> {{in the early stages of}} the learning process – as the walls get higher – until there is sufficient evidence of knowledge and skills having been acquired, to then be able to remove that scaffolding so the learner is able to 'stand alone', or be effectively independent enough to continue learning 'alone'. In a similar way, there is a gradual dismantling of the scaffolding as the 'job' becomes more secure and so there is a gradual release of responsibility from the teacher to the learner. As scaffolding is temporary, so too are the lessons that are constructed to help students as they embark into unfamiliar thinking. As noted by Pearson and Gallagher, [...] "The critical stage of the model is the 'guided practice,' the stage in which the teacher gradually releases task responsibility to the students." [...] As such, these lessons eventually fade away as students become gradually more comfortable with the learning and are able to work without the necessary guidance of the teacher.|$|E
