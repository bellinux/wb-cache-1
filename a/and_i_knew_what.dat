500|$|The {{first thing}} for a private {{secretary}} {{to do is to}} study her employer. After I went to work for Mr. Roosevelt, for months I read carefully all the letters he dictated ... I learned what letters he wanted to see and which ones it was not necessary to show him ... I came to know exactly how Mr. Roosevelt would answer some of his letters, how he would couch his thoughts. When he discovered that I had learned these things it took a load off his shoulders, for instead of having to dictate the answers to many letters he could just say yes or no <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> to say and how to say it.|$|E
500|$|Murphy created Burt as [...] "a working-class dude who's {{not okay}} {{with his son}} being gay, a guy who's having a tough time." [...] The {{character}} is loosely based on his own father. He had O'Malley in mind when casting the role, and felt confident about his capability: [...] "It's a real tour de force role <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> Mike could do. This isn't an after-school special. ... It's heavy and Mike {{has the ability to}} cut through the sentiment." [...] He went on to say, [...] "Mike's talent is deep. I will always write for Mike O'Malley." [...] The actor did not have to audition, and was invited to read for the part by Murphy personally. The two men, along with Falchuk, had previously worked together on the television movie Pretty/Handsome. While reading the first twenty pages of script, O'Malley was not initially enthusiastic about playing the role, as the character appeared to be an intolerant stereotype. He changed his mind, however, after realizing that Burt was to be portrayed as a more accepting man, with [...] "grace and love that comes first for his son." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1948, Davis {{was cast}} in the melodrama Winter Meeting. Although she was {{initially}} enthusiastic, she soon learned that Warner had arranged for [...] "softer" [...] lighting {{to be used to}} disguise her age. She recalled that she had seen the same lighting technique [...] "on the sets of Ruth Chatterton and Kay Francis, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> they meant". She began to regret accepting the role.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1990 interview, Page {{said that}} the album took only about 36 hours of studio time (over a span of a few weeks) to create (including mixing), adding that he knew this because of the amount charged on the studio bill. One of the primary reasons for the short {{recording}} time was that the material selected for the album had been well-rehearsed and pre-arranged by the band on Led Zeppelin's tour of Scandinavia in September 1968. As Page explained, [...] " [...] had begun developing the arrangements on the Scandinavian tour <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> sound I was looking for. It just came together incredibly quickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{had these}} pieces, these guitar pieces, that I {{wanted to put}} together. I had a whole idea {{of a piece of}} music that I really wanted to try and present to {{everybody}} and try and come to terms with. Bit difficult really, because it started on acoustic, and as you know it goes through to the electric parts. But we had various run-throughs [...] where I was playing the acoustic guitar and jumping up and picking up the electric guitar. Robert was sitting in the corner, or rather leaning against the wall, and as I was routining the rest of the band with this idea and this piece, he was just writing. And {{all of a sudden he}} got up and started singing, along with another run-through, and he must have had 80% of the words there ... I had these sections, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> order they were going to go in, but it was just a matter of getting everybody to feel comfortable with each gear shift that was going to be coming.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{it was not}} planned, Zsa Zsa {{was given}} a {{personality}} {{similar to that of}} her on-screen aunt, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), an established character in EastEnders. During the development of the character, she changed a lot and was fluid until filming started, when Kenny had a full day on set with Henry. She explained: [...] "The words were there <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> she was like but when I saw Linda [...] speak and when I engaged with her, I realised that it was like looking in a mirror." [...] When the character was announced, she was described as beautiful, funky, an outspoken tomboy, very bright, but likes to think she does not need anybody's help. Kenny said of the character in an interview with Soaplife magazine: [...] "Zsa Zsa doesn't like authority or anyone who messes with her. She's a lone wolf and doesn't care about anyone." [...] She told entertainment website Digital Spy that Zsa Zsa is [...] "a real bitch" [...] and [...] "very mean and cold", while a profile for the character on the official EastEnders website says she is sarcastic, a rebel and [...] "desperately wants the security that comes with a family but is terrified of being dependent on anyone. Her experience has taught her that adults let you down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No more do I, Charlotte,' {{said her}} brother, in a mock consoling tone. 'You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{is good for}} us, and despise sublunary vanities.' ...|$|R
60|$|LIZA. You're no gentleman, you're not, {{to talk of}} such things. I'm a good girl, <b>I</b> am; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{the like}} of you are, I do.|$|R
6000|$|... "How coolly you say so! You have iron nerves, all you Douglases. I {{have heard}} all, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you have suffered. How soon will you leave London?" ...|$|R

60|$|They changed {{clothes at}} the cottage. I could repeat {{the words in}} my mind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> they meant of themselves, but I {{attached}} no meaning to them in any other connexion.|$|E
60|$|HE [with quiet conviction] Your {{heart will}} tell you at the right time. I have thought deeply over this; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> we two must do, sooner or later.|$|R
5000|$|He said, [...] "Did I {{not tell}} you that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the unseen aspects of the heavens and the earth? <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you reveal <b>and</b> what you have concealed.” (2:33) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are safe}} right here, {{if you have}} sense enough to stay here," [...] {{declared}} Jerry Muskrat rather testily. [...] "Don't you suppose Peter <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> we are talking about?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{came back}} safely; but he dragged himself up the {{stairway}} {{with his face}} all twisted the next night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> had happened before he told me. 'Those devils have poisoned me,' said he." ...|$|E
60|$|His rod {{turned at}} several other places, but I had {{objections}} {{to all of}} them. A sanitary engineer had once visited me, and he {{had given me a}} great deal of advice about drainage, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> to avoid.|$|E
6000|$|Presently {{all things}} {{vanished}} suddenly from my sight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> it meant. The next moment {{we were walking}} along in our village; and down toward the river I saw the twinkling lights of the Golden Stag. Then in the dark I heard a joyful cry: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{another word}} on that point, Dick." [...] Hardwick's voice grew stern. [...] "I am a man, {{while you are}} a boy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> is best for both of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>what</b> {{that amounts to}} now. My idea is that you acted as an honest man when you were last here. You are not a rich man--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, and it {{has driven}} men into asylums who never found their way on to the medical staff. I was a very shy fellow myself as a student, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it means." ...|$|R
6000|$|From {{my brain}} the soul-wings budded, waved a flame about my body, [...] Whence {{conventions}} coiled to ashes.

6000|$|... "That's another!" [...] said he, poking {{the fire}} savagely, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> he meant. One cannot put steam-heat in houses where Queen Elizabeth slept. The steady beat of a night-mail, {{whirling}} down the valley, recalled me to business. [...] "What about the Great Buchonian?" [...] I said.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was her thought. Had we {{not shared}} it for forty years? And {{the moment of}} its consummation had come at last. So I, too, {{affected}} not to recognize my enemy, and, putting on an idiotic senility, I, too, crawled in the dust toward the litter whining for mercy and charity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very possibly," [...] Newman rejoined. [...] "But {{she will}} not <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> was in that convent {{yesterday}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> SHE is doing. Lord deliver us! You can guess whether {{it made me feel}} forgiving!" ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{just had}} surgery on Dec 3rd <b>and</b> <b>I</b> WILL be back. Don't count {{me out for}} 2012 because I have the {{experience}} from this past year <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{it takes to be}} a champion.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're too bad, Minver," [...] Halson protested. [...] "The {{charm of}} the whole thing was her perfect innocence. She isn't capable of the {{slightest}} finesse. I've known her from a child, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> say." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had on a}} long {{frock coat}} that reached nearly to his knees. He was leading a little {{procession}} of very heavy men in morning coats, upstairs towards the private luncheon rooms. They moved like a funeral, puffing as they went. I had seen company directors before <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> they were at sight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not to mother; but to {{hear him}} and Miss Parsons is enough to drive one wild.

60|$|What did I see as I {{walked quickly}} along the glen road, with Babbie silent by my side, and I doubt not pods of the broom {{cracking}} all around us? I saw myself entering the Auld Licht manse, where Margaret sat weeping {{over the body}} of Gavin, and there was none to break my coming to her, for none but she <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> had been.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sometimes, Ally--in a {{very small}} way. <b>I</b> am old <b>and</b> timid. <b>I</b> have taken trifles from {{children}} now and then, my deary, but not often.

6000|$|... "You think you're smooth, don't you? But I'm onto you, Jimmy Crocker. A lot of Jimmy Crocker you are. You're a crook. Get me? <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you're after, at that. You're {{going to}} try to kidnap me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Avanindra Pandey, {{the friend}} of the victim who was injured in the attack, said, [...] "The facts are hidden and the content is fake. Only Jyoti <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{happened}} on that night and the documentary is far from truth." ...|$|R
