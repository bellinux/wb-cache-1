50|$|The ribbed vault, {{another key}} {{feature of the}} Gothic style, has a history just as colorful, having long been adapted for the Roman (Villa of Sette Bassi), Sassanian, Islamic (Abbas I's Mosque at Isfahan, Mosque of Cristo de la Luz), Romanesque (L'Hôpital-Saint-Blaise), and then Gothic styles. Until {{the height of the}} Gothic era, few Western rib vaults matched the {{complexity}} of Islamic (mostly Moorish), beginning with experiments in Armenia and Georgia, from the 10th to the 13th centuries, such as ribbed domes (Ani Cathedral and Nikortsminda Cathedral), diagonal arches on a square field (Ani), and arches perpendicular to walls (Homoros Vank). However, the function of these vaults is entirely structural rather than decorative, as in Gothic cathedrals. However, their indrect method of supporting the vault via its shoulders has been found at Casale Monferrato, Tour Guinette, and at a tower at Bayeux Cathedral. One reason for this perhaps is the record of economic and political exchange between some of western Europe and Armenia, which might explain the similarities between Armenian architecture and the ribbed vaults at San Nazzaro Sesia and at Lodi Vecchio in Lombardy and the Abbey of Saint Aubin in Angers. Ribbed vaults saw something of a golden <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> in the Anglo-Norman period, and led to the establishment of French Gothic and outlined many future Gothic solutions to the problem of support with buttresses.|$|E

40|$|The present {{contribution}} {{addresses the}} issue of preventing and combating gender and sex discrimination in subjects in the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> and, specifically, children. In our society, characterized by an ideological sexist, genderist and heterocentric matrix, identities that cannot placed within the socially constructed and accepted stereotypes of normality are – often – victims of abuses and they are denied equal treatment. In order {{to raise awareness of}} the need to respect personal and social differences, more and more initiatives are being created aimed at promoting a non-discriminatory attitude towards gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, non-conforming and queer people. Among such initiatives, the construction and narration of stories for children explaining the concepts inherent in the culture of differences, are a valid tool for fostering a climate and a cultural structure free of gender and sex stigmatization and instead aiming at enhancing “difference”, considering it a positive possibility just like socially-accepted states. The essay, after {{a brief description of the}} characteristics of language, attitudes and relationship with reality in subjects in the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> examines the methodological and ethical approach to be used with children, so as to allow them to understand the possibility of different forms of identity and otherness.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between the age of reaching motor milestones, especially anti-gravity activities, and the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> of pathological spinal curvatures in children with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). We hypothesized that earlier achievement of anti-gravity motor milestones predicts a later development of pathological spinal curvatures. Ninety-six children participated in this retrospective study. The severity of the disease was classified according to Sillence into types I-IV. Spinal radiography was performed annually and spinal deformities were measured according to the Cobb angle. Scoliosis was defined as a Cobb angle exceeding 9 degrees. Pathological thoracic kyphosis was defined as a Cobb angle exceeding 40 degrees. The parents were asked to report the age at which the child achieved motor milestones, and data were checked against health care records. Thirty-seven of 96 children (39 %) developed a scoliosis of more than 9 degrees. Nine of 96 children (9 %) developed a pathological kyphosis. The age of developing scoliosis was significantly lower than the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> of the pathological kyphosis (P= 0. 01). Bone mineral density was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in 53 children, 28 of whom developed scoliosis, and 25 of whom did not. The mean DEXA Z-score of the 28 children with scoliosis was significantly lower than that of the 25 children without (- 5. 2, SD 1. 3 vs - 3. 2, SD 1. 9; P-value < 0. 001). Children with OI type IV, but particularly OI type III, reached motor milestones much later than children with OI type I. The motor milestone "supported sitting" showed a significant inverse association with time of the first presence of scoliosis with a Cobb angle greater than 9 degrees (linear regression coefficient: - 1. 3, 95 % confidence interval: - 2. 6 to - 0. 03). The age of achieving the motor milestones "lifting the head to 45 degrees in prone position", "rolling", and "supported-" and "unsupported standing" were not significantly associated with age of the first presence of scoliosis with a Cobb angle greater than 9 degrees. However, the directions of associations suggest that here, too, there is a tendency for later development of scoliosis in those who reach milestones at earlier ages. Multivariable analyses showed that the motor milestone "sitting with support" was significantly associated with age of first achieving scoliosis, independent of gender and type of OI (linear regression coefficient: - 0. 9, 95 % confidence interval: - 1. 3 to - 0. 5). We conclude that in children with OI, the age of anti-gravity motor milestones was associated with the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> of pathological spinal curvatures.

40|$|The recent {{observation}} of gravitational waves, stimulates {{the question of}} the longtime evolution of the space-time fluctuations. Gravitational waves interact themselves through the nonlinear character of Einstein's equations of general relativity. This nonlinear wave interaction allows the spectral energy transfer from mode to mode. According to the wave turbulence theory, the weakly nonlinear interaction of gravitational waves leads to the existence of an irreversible kinetic regime that dominates the longtime evolution. The resulting kinetic equation suggests the existence of an equilibrium wave spectrum and the existence of a non-equilibrium Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum for spatio-temporal fluctuations. Evidence of these solutions extracted in the fluctuating signal of the recent observations will be discussed in the paper. Probably, the present results would be pertinent in the new <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> of gravitational astronomy, as well as, in new tests of General Relativity. Comment: 5 page...|$|E

40|$|Although human {{intelligence}} {{has been studied}} {{by a lot of}} researchers, today we are still far from reaching a commonly accepted definition that merges together its main features. In the last century, the debate on intelligence focused on scholars’ attempt to establish which factor plays a crucial role in determining differences in the individuals’ intelligence. More specifically, researchers have compared two opposing views that involve two different factors: environment and genetics, trying to ascertain to what extent one prevails against the other. The debate stems from one of Jensen famous article in which he shows the studies himself directed on the importance of genetics {{in the development of the}} intelligence. Overcoming the idea according to which aptitude differences and progress to school are due to education, he claimed, on the basis of his researches, that the individual’s level of intelligence is determined predominantly by an innate aptitude rather than by environmental conditions. In the Seventies a bitter dispute over this topic took place involving two psychologists called Hans J. Eysenck and Leon Kamin who embody two opposing point of view. The echoes of their clash still influence the nowadays speculations because the matter under dispute concerns also the social, political and even ethical field. In fact, if we assume that general cognitive ability is essentially an inherited trait, we necessarily need to accept the idea according to which it is useless to invest human and economic resources in behalf of individuals destined anyway to remain mired in their mediocrity. On the other hand, if we assume that intelligence, at least in the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> can be empowered by means of appropriate techniques, no alibi would still be employed by the persons who feel free to abandon their fellows to their destiny because intellectually less endowed than them.
