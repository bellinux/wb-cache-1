40|$|The shikimate pathway {{provides}} carbon skeletons for the aromatic <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> <b>L-tryptophan,</b> L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine. It is a {{high flux}} bearing pathway {{and it has been}} estimated that greater than 30 % of all fixed carbon is directed through this pathway. These combined pathways have been subjected to considerable research attention due to the fact that mammals are unable to synthesize these amino acids and the fact that one of the enzymes of the shikimate pathway is a very effective herbicide target. However, in addition to these characteristics these pathways additionally provide important precursors for a wide range of important secondary metabolites including chlorogenic acid, alkaloids, glucosinolates, auxin, tannins, suberin, lignin and lignan, tocopherols and betalains. Here we review the shikimate pathway of the green lineage and compare and contrast its evolution and ubiquity with that of the more specialized phenylpropanoid metabolism which this essential pathway fuels...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} the real-time fluorescence characteristics of bacterial bioaerosols (Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis) thermally inactivated to produce {{various degrees of}} cellular culturability. Bacterial bioaerosols were exposed to various temperatures for very short times in a thermal electric tube furnace and then passed into an aerosol fluorescence measurement system that measured the ultraviolet (UV) light-induced fluorescence intensity of airborne particles in real time. The fluorescence of particles in the optical sensing zone was continuously measured with two photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) equipped with optical filters to detect radiation in the UV and visible (Vis) bands. The results showed that both UV- and Vis-fluorescence intensities decreased with increasing deactivation temperature. Also, the ratio of UV- to Vis-fluorescence decreased with increasing temperature for each bacterial bioaerosol. Under the same experimental conditions, {{we found that the}} airborne aromatic <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> (<b>L-tryptophan</b> and L-tyrosine) and ovalbumin particles showed similar reduction trends in their fluorescence characteristics, compared with the test bacterial bioaerosols. These results provide basic information on the feasibility of intrinsic fluorescence measurements for real-time characterization of biological particles...|$|E
40|$|The two {{olfactory}} epithelia of flatfish of {{the family}} Soleidae are essentially in contact with two distinct environments; the upper (right) side samples open water while the lower (left) side samples interstitial water. This study assessed {{whether there are differences}} in the responsiveness of the two epithelia by use of the electro‐olfactogram in the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis). The upper epithelium was significantly more responsive to the basic amino acids (l‐lysine and l‐arginine), glycine, and l‐threonine than the lower epithelium. The lower epithelium was significantly more responsive to aromatic <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> (<b>l‐tryptophan,</b> l‐tyrosine, l‐DOPA, and l‐phenylalanine), l‐leucine, and l‐asparagine than the upper. Both epithelia had similar responsiveness to the sulphur‐containing amino acids (l‐cysteine and l‐methionine), l‐alanine, l‐serine, and l‐glutamine. Neither side was responsive to the acidic amino acids (l‐aspartate and l‐glutamate) or the D‐isomers of any amino acid tested. The upper olfactory organ was much more responsive to conspecific‐derived stimuli (bile and intestinal fluid) than the lower organ. We suggest that these differences in responsiveness may be related to different functional roles of the upper and lower epithelia in feeding and chemical communication...|$|E

40|$|A new {{polymer matrix}} {{containing}} particulate silver {{has been developed}} for the introduction of analytes with low or negligible volatility into molecular beams via laser desorption. These silver-containing film matrices (SCFM) permit stable desorption to proceed for extended periods (ca. approximately 10 h) and have been applied successfully to the nondestructive volatilization {{of a number of}} amino acids and a transition-metal compound. Analytes can be extracted directly from solution onto the SCFM surface by simply dipping the film into the solution and then air-drying the film. The laser desorption apparatus, when coupled to a supersonic molecular beam/laser ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer, permits the detection of the analytes at femtogram levels. Furthermore, we have developed a reel-to-reel tape transport device that allows extended usage of the analyte-loaded SFCM, thereby permitting the measurement of wavelength-scanned mass-selected resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization spectra of analytes with low or negligible volatility. We demonstrate this application with the aromatic <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> <b>L-tryptophan</b> and L-phenylalanine.

Our aim was to compare {{the effects of the}} <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> <b>L-tryptophan</b> (L-trp) and L-leucine (L-leu) separately on gastric emptying and gut peptide secretion. The study was conducted as a randomized (balanced), double-blind, parallel-group trial. A total of 10 lean and 10 non-diabetic obese participants were included. Participants received intragastric loads of L-trp (0. 52 g and 1. 56 g) and L-leu (1. 56 g), dissolved in 300 mL tap water; 75 g glucose and 300 mL tap water served as control treatments. Results of the study are: i) L-trp at the higher dose stimulates CCK release (p = 0. 0018), and induces a significant retardation in gastric emptying (p = 0. 0033); ii) L-trp at the higher dose induced a small increase in GLP- 1 secretion (p = 0. 0257); iii) neither of the amino acids modulated subjective appetite feelings; and iv) the two amino acids did not alter insulin or glucose concentrations. L-trp is a luminal regulator of CCK release with effects on gastric emptying, an effect that could be mediated by CCK. L-trp's effect on GLP- 1 secretion is only minor.

40|$|GPR 139 is {{an orphan}} G protein-coupled {{receptor}} that is expressed {{primarily in the}} brain. Not much is known regarding the function of GPR 139. Recently we have shown that GPR 139 is activated by the <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> <b>l-tryptophan</b> and l-phenylalanine (EC 50 values of 220  μM and 320  μM, respectively), as well as di-peptides comprised of aromatic amino acids. This led us to hypothesize that GPR 139 may be activated by peptides. Sequence alignment of the binding cavities of all class A GPCRs, revealed that the binding pocket of the melanocortin 4 receptor {{is similar to that}} of GPR 139. Based on the chemogenomics principle "similar targets bind similar ligands", we tested three known endogenous melanocortin 4 receptor agonists; adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and α- and β-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH and β-MSH) on CHO-k 1 cells stably expressing the human GPR 139 in a Fluo- 4 Ca(2 +) -assay. All three peptides, as well as their conserved core motif HFRW, were found to activate GPR 139 in the low micromolar range. Moreover, we found that peptides consisting of nine or ten N-terminal residues of α-MSH activate GPR 139 in the submicromolar range. α-MSH 1 - 9 was found to correspond to the product of a predicted cleavage site in the pre-pro-protein pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). Our results demonstrate that GPR 139 is a peptide receptor, activated by ACTH, α-MSH, β-MSH, the conserved core motif HFRW as well as a potential endogenous peptide α-MSH 1 - 9. Further studies are needed to determine the functional relevance of GPR 139 mediated signaling by these peptides. This work was supported by the Lundbeck Foundation (separate grants to H. B. -O., D.

25|$|Dimethyltryptamine is an indole {{alkaloid}} {{derived from}} the shikimate pathway. Its biosynthesis is relatively simple and summarized in the adjacent picture. In plants, the parent <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>L-tryptophan</b> is produced endogenously where in animals L-tryptophan is an essential <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> coming from diet. No matter the source of L-tryptophan, the biosynthesis begins with its decarboxylation by an aromatic <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme (step 1). The resulting decarboxylated tryptophan analog is tryptamine. Tryptamine then undergoes a transmethylation (step 2): the enzyme indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from cofactor S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), via nucleophilic attack, to tryptamine. This reaction transforms SAM into S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and gives the intermediate product N-methyltryptamine (NMT). NMT is in turn transmethylated by the same process (step 3) to form the end product N,N-dimethyltryptamine.

30|$|Decreased {{levels of}} the {{essential}} <b>amino</b> <b>acid,</b> <b>l-tryptophan,</b> {{can be caused by}} overexpression of IDO on tumor cells [175, 176]. It is well documented from studies in mouse models and patients that IDO expressed in cancer cells or DC in the cancer microenvironment mediates immunosuppressive effects and tolerance to tumor via mechanisms independent from l-tryptophan deprivation [177, 178]. Detailed recent studies designed to delineate the mechanisms of tumor cell IDO-induced immunosuppression showed that the effect of IDO in the tumor microenvironment is mediated through increased differentiation of Treg cells at the tumor site, systemic expansion of myeloid cells and marked recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) into the tumor microenvironment [179]. Such correlation between IDO expression and MDSC infiltration has been identified not only in experimental animal models but also in samples from human patients with melanoma [179]. Metabolic competition and nutrient deprivation, accumulation of metabolic byproducts, effects of IDO act in concert with microenvironmental changes induced by hypoxia and tumor aerobic glycolysis to form a barrier to antitumor T cell immunity.|$|R

Alcohol consumption was studied in an aversion model in rats and in alcohol-preferring C 57 mice. Results: Combined administration of Trp + BSZ, but neither compound alone, produced a strong inhibition of ALDH activity and an increase in blood acetaldehyde concentration after ethanol, and induced aversion to alcohol in rats and decreased preference in mice. Another kynureninase inhibitor, carbidopa, induced aversion to alcohol by itself, which was reversed by Trp co-administration. Conclusions: The present results establish a prior art for the use of a combination of Trp plus BSZ in the treatment of alcoholism by aversion, which merits rapid clinical development...|$|R
40|$|Coherent control {{based on}} a feedback-controlled {{self-learning}} loop was applied to enhance the ratio of two-photon (2 P) fluorescence from a fluorescent label enhanced green fluorescence protein and three-photon (3 P) fluorescence from the essential <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>L-Tryptophan.</b> The two biosamples were mixed in a buffer solution contained in a quartz cuvette and exposed to near-infrared laser pulses from a femtosecond (fs) oscillator. However, the enhancement of the 2 P/ 3 P fluorescence ratio was always accompanied by a significant loss of the valuable 2 P fluorescence. To achieve a trade-off between the 2 P/ 3 P fluorescence ratio and the 2 P fluorescence intensity, we then engineered the cost function in the self-learning algorithm. The optimal pulse shape obtained by use of the engineered cost function could be useful for 2 P fluorescence imaging of living cells with reduced phototoxicity, because DNA and protein can be directly damaged by 3 P absorption of fs laser according to an excitation band similar to 270 nm.
