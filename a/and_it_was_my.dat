The concern that my art was misused for propaganda had to yield to the greater concern that German music be preserved, that music {{be given to the}} German people by its own musicians. These people, the compatriots of Bach and Beethoven, of Mozart and Schubert, still had to go on living under the control of a regime obsessed with total war. No one who did not live here himself in those days can possibly judge what it was like.|$|E

500|$|Three weeks later, Hubbard {{abducted}} both Northrup and Alexis. On {{the night}} of February 24, 1951, Alexis was being looked after by John Sanborne while Northrup had {{a night at the}} movies. Hubbard turned up and took the child. A few hours later, he returned with two of his Dianetics Foundation staff and told Northrup, who was now back at her apartment: [...] "We have Alexis and you'll never see her alive unless you come with us." [...] She was bundled {{into the back of a}} car and driven to San Bernardino, California, where Hubbard attempted to find a doctor to examine his wife and declare her insane. His search was unsuccessful and he released her at Yuma Airport across the state line in Arizona. He promised that he would tell her where Alexis was if she signed a piece of paper saying that she had gone with him voluntarily. Northrup agreed but Hubbard reneged on the deal and flew to Chicago, where he found a psychologist who wrote a favorable report about his mental condition to refute Northrup's accusations. Rather than telling Northrup where Alexis was, he called her and said that [...] "he had cut [...] into little pieces and dropped the pieces in a river and that he had seen little arms and legs floating down the river <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> fault, I'd done it because I'd left him." ...|$|E

The Times newspaper, 31 May 2009, reported that all documents relating to the aircraft were immediately impounded but Sqn Ldr Guy Bazalgette, commander of the Nimrod detachment in the Gulf, managed to retrieve one file. Bazalgette subsequently destroyed the document but later told the coroners inquest {{that none of the}} shredded documents were relevant to the loss of XV230.

2500|$|Blethyn's last film of 1998 was Little Voice {{opposite}} Jane Horrocks and Michael Caine. Cast against type, {{she played}} a domineering yet needy fish factory worker who has nothing but contempt for her shy daughter and lusts after a local showbiz agent. A breakaway from the kind at heart roles Blethyn had previously played, it was the character's antipathy that attracted the actress to accept the role of Mari: [...] "I have to understand why she is the way she is. She is a desperate woman, but she also has an optimistic take on life which I find enviable. Whilst I don't approve of her behaviour, {{there is a reason}} for it <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> job to work that out." [...] Both Blethyn's performance and the film received rave reviews, and the following year, she was again Oscar nominated, this time for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.|$|E

"I loved {{watching}} {{old black}} and white movies, and I always also loved the music of Glenn Miller and Cole Porter, that whole era of writing, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> attempt to write a song to depict the romantic era. It came out very quickly, I wrote it in about half an hour. Even though {{a lot of people}} think it sounds complicated, on the guitar it's very simple to play. It nearly never got recorded - when the time came to record it, the keyboard player I wanted to use, Peter Jones, was out of town, so we cut the band track with a different keyboard player. It didn't work. A few days later when we tried it again with a different keyboard player, again it didn't work, and the band was losing interest in the song. Just before the album was finished, Peter Jones came back into town, the band and I had an argument because I wanted to give Reminiscing a third chance. Peter played on it, we cut it, and finished it, and sent the album to Capitol. Capitol said that they couldn't hear any singles on the album, and didn't know what to release. Five weeks later, someone at Capitol's New York office said 'You're all crazy, Reminiscing is a smash.' Capitol put it out, and it just immediately caught on fire, and became our highest chart hit." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his May 2014 {{interview}} with NBC News, Snowden accused the U.S. government {{of trying to}} use one position here or there in his career to distract from the totality of his experience, downplaying him as a [...] "low level analyst." [...] In his words, he was [...] "trained as a spy {{in the traditional sense}} of the word in that I lived and worked undercover overseas—pretending to work in a job that I'm not—and even being assigned a name that was not mine." [...] He said he'd worked for the NSA undercover overseas, and for the DIA had developed sources and methods to keep information and people secure [...] "in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world. So when they say I'm a low-level systems administrator, that I don't know what I'm talking about, I'd say it's somewhat misleading." [...] In a June {{interview with}} Globo TV, Snowden reiterated that he [...] "was actually functioning at a very senior level." [...] In a July interview with The Guardian, Snowden explained that, during his NSA career, [...] "I began to move from merely overseeing these systems to actively directing their use. Many people don’t understand that I was actually an analyst and I designated individuals and groups for targeting." [...] Snowden subsequently told Wired that while at Dell in 2011, [...] "I would sit down with the CIO of the CIA, the CTO of the CIA, the chiefs of all the technical branches.
