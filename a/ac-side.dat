40|$|Abstract—The {{full-bridge}} converter {{is often}} connected between the ac grid and the dc bus. In the conventional multiloop control, the inner current control loop shapes the <b>ac-side</b> current waveform, {{and the outer}} voltage control loop regulates the dc-bus voltage. In this paper, the single-loop bidirectional current sensorless control (BCSC) for the full-bridge ac/dc converter with considering both the inductor resistance and conduction voltage is first proposed. The average-value behavior of the full-bridge ac/dc converter is analyzed and it is simplified to an equivalent single-switch model. Based on this developed equivalent model, BCSC is designed and implemented in the FPGA-based system. There is only voltage control loop in the proposed BCSC (i. e., no current control loop), but BCSC is able to regulate the dc-bus voltage and shape the <b>ac-side</b> current.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} circulating current of modular multi-level converter (MMC) based a high voltage direct current (HVDC) system under unbalanced grid conditions. Due to the connection of a dependent DC source in each phase, the MMC system inherently generates the power ripple of double-line-frequency components in the <b>AC-side</b> and as a result, the additional sinusoidal current named circulating current flows through the each arm. Reliability improvement of HVDC system under an unbalanced grid condition {{is one of the}} important criteria. Generally, the modeling of the circulating current is based on the power relation between DC-side and <b>AC-side.</b> However, the method is not perfectly matched in the MMC system due to the difference of the structural characteristic. In this paper, improved modeling method of circulating current is proposed, which is based on the inner arm power.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modeling {{and design of}} a closed-loop controller for a Z-source inverter. The Z-source inverter is a recently proposed single-stage power converter, and {{it is capable of}} operating in both buck and boost modes. Hence, this inverter gives an economical solution for power conversion in distributed generation (DG) applications, particularly by eliminating the need for a two-stage conversion. Moreover, applications such as DG demand quality output waveforms, and additionally, when the system is subjected to input- and load-side disturbances, their effects need to be minimized. This can be achieved with closed-loop controlling. Toward this end, the system is modeled first with large- and small-signal modeling techniques, and relevant transfer functions are derived. The dc-side of the Z-source inverter shows a non-minimum-phase characteristic, and the output voltage of a Z-source impedance network shows a significant overshoot and undershoot, following a step change in the input due to energy resettling. These effects could be transferred to the <b>ac-side,</b> giving rise to the undershoot and overshoot in the ac output as well. Hence, the proposed controllers should be able to minimize such effects. The ac- and dc-sides are considered separately when designing the controllers. An indirect controller is employed in the dc-side, whereas the <b>ac-side</b> controller is designed in the synchronous reference frame. The modulation index, shoot-through time, and saturation levels are appropriately selected so that the dc-side effects are prevented from propagating into the <b>ac-side.</b> The simulation results are obtained using a state-space-averaged inverter model, and an experimental prototype is built in a laboratory to prove the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. Simulation and experimental results show good reference-tracking and disturbance-rejection properties, validating the desired functionality of the proposed controller...|$|E
40|$|A single-stage, bidirectional, current-source {{converter}} (CSC) topology {{to interface}} a dc microgrid with an ac grid is {{reported in the}} literature. In this topology, under a balanced grid voltage condition, the dc-link inductor current can be regulated over a wide range-from zero to rated value-while the <b>ac-side</b> current has low harmonic distortion. However, unbalanced grid voltages result in second-harmonic pulsation in the current and power on the dc side of the converter. In addition, the <b>ac-side</b> currents will be unbalanced due {{to the presence of}} a negative-sequence component. This would result in undesired tripping of the converter if one of the phase currents exceeded its rated value. Various control loop structures for the operation of voltage-source converter under unbalanced grid voltage conditions are reported in the literature. However, use of similar control loop structures for CSC may lead to unstable operation. Therefore, a control scheme to inject balanced three-phase currents into the ac grid under an unbalanced grid voltage condition is proposed in this paper. The stability of the proposed control scheme is studied using a small-signal model of the converter.

40|$|Current Source Inverter (CSI) {{topology}} {{is gaining}} acceptance as a competitive alternative for grid interface {{of renewable energy}} systems due to its unique and advantageous features. Merits of CSI over the more popular Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) topology have been elaborated on {{by a number of}} researchers. However, there is a dearth of quality work in modeling and control of CSI topology interfacing renewable energy resources to the grid. To enrich the study focussing on application of CSI for renewable energy interface, this thesis develops a multilevel structure based on CSI for three-phase grid-connected Photovoltaic (PV) application. In the first part of research, a single-stage CSI interfacing to PV array is developed. The CSI-based PV system is equipped with Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT), DC-link current controller, and <b>AC-side</b> current controller. To eliminate the nonlinearity introduced by the PV array, a feed-forward control is introduced in the DC-link current controller. The <b>AC-side</b> current controller is responsible for maintaining unity power factor at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC). To verify the performance of the developed CSI-based PV system, a number of simulation studies are carried out in PSCAD/EMTDC environment. To illustrate the performance of the CSI-based PV system during transients on the grid side, simulation studies are carried out for four kinds of faults. Results obtained from fault studies are highly in favor of CSI topology and provide illustrative evidence for short-circuit current protection capability of the CSI. On the other hand, the VSI-based PV system performs poorly when subjected to similar grid transients. To extend the research on CSI-based PV system further, a multilevel structure based on CSI is developed. The multilevel structure is a parallel combination of $n$ CSI units and capable of producing $ 2 n+ 1 $ levels of current at the terminal of the inverter. Each unit in the multilevel structure has its own MPPT, DC-link current controller. However, on the <b>AC-side</b> a combined current controller is proposed. The design results in a high power rating with reduced number of filters, sensors and controllers. The developed multilevel structure can operate with PV arrays exposed to equal and unequal insolation level. However, when the PV arrays are operating under unequal insolation level, low order harmonics are generated in the sinusoidal current that is injected into the grid. Elimination of these harmonics is performed by implementing a modified control strategy in stationary reference frame that corresponds to the harmonic component that needs to be minimized. The modified control strategy operates in coordination with the existing DC-side and <b>AC-side</b> current controllers, and MPPTs. Therefore, real-time suppression of current harmonics can be ensured. Performance of the multilevel structure is verified by different transient studies...|$|E
