5|$|Chikka Devaraja (r. 1672–1704), {{the most}} notable of Mysore's early kings, who ruled during much of this period, managed to not only survive the exigencies but further {{expanded}} territory. He achieved this by forging strategic alliances with the Marathas and the Mughals. The kingdom soon grew to include Salem and Bangalore to the east, Hassan to the west, Chikkamagaluru and Tumkur {{to the north and}} the rest of Coimbatore to the south. Despite this expansion, the kingdom, which now accounted for <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> of land in the southern Indian heartland, extending from the Western Ghats to the western boundaries of the Coromandel plain, remained landlocked without direct coastal access. Chikka Devaraja's attempts to remedy this brought Mysore into conflict with the Nayaka chiefs of Ikkeri and the kings (Rajas) of Kodagu (modern Coorg); who between them controlled the Kanara coast (coastal areas of modern Karnataka) and the intervening hill region respectively. The conflict brought mixed results with Mysore annexing Periyapatna but suffering a reversal at Palupare.|$|E

The British Government wanted the Cambridge team to be relocated to North America, in proximity to the raw materials it required, and where the American research was being done. But Sir John Anderson wanted the British team to retain its own identity, and was concerned that since the Americans were working on nuclear reactor designs using nuclear graphite as a neutron moderator instead of heavy water, that team might not receive <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> of resources.

Second, the state guaranteed that the bargadars would receive <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> of the crop (75 per cent if the bargadar provided the non-labour inputs and 50 per cent if the landlord provides those inputs).

An enhanced algorithm for TCP in wireless Ad Hoc networks is needed to obtain <b>a</b> <b>fairer</b> <b>share</b> of the available bandwidth, tackle re-routing problems and solve the problems associated with older TCP Vegas flows. Approach: TCP-Vegas uses an Estimation of the propagation delay, base RTT, to adjust its window size and it is very important for a TCP Vegas connection {{to be able to have}} an accurate estimation. Results: One of the issues is rerouting (a path), which change the propagation delay of the connection and this may be able to result in a substantial decrease in through put. The issue identified with TCP Vegas was reinvestigated and to address them, a modification to TCP Vegass congestion avoidance algorithm is proposed.
