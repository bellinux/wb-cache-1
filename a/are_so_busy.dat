Because of such fragmentation, health workers in several African countries, for example, say they <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> meeting western delegates that they can only do their proper jobs in the evening.|$|E
2500|$|Polanyi {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} {{about the impact of}} the Nobel Prize on his research, feeling that his name on research proposals and papers often brought additional scrutiny, and also had people questioning his dedication to science after the honour. Polanyi said, [...] "There is a very reasonable suspicion that you <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> doing the things that Nobel Prize winners do that you are actually only giving half your mind to science." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In money, dear. All these {{preparations}} that Susan and I <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> with--I {{have been}} able to purchase very little for myself. You were poor before. But how much poorer I shall make you, Walter!' ...|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Conroy {{said she}} had not {{expected}} the pleasure of a personal interview; Mr. Dumphy must <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> always.|$|R
6000|$|... "I dare say, so I'll keep {{my flesh}} on, thank you. You <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> you can't read to a fellow, I suppose?" [...] asked Mac, whose eyes were better, but still too weak for books.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{never do}} go, you <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy,</b> and I'm tired of waiting. I'd rather {{go and get}} the berries for you all myself. I love to pick 'em, and I want to fill my new pail dreffly," [...] sobbed Rob.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] she returned, [...] "there's {{suitability}} in it--you <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy,</b> and so neat, and so peculiarly situated altogether that there's suitability in it, and it {{will come}} to pass. And nobody, my love, will congratulate you more sincerely on such a marriage than I shall." ...|$|E

60|$|Daisy heard, but <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> re-reading {{the letter}} that she took no notice then, though she {{recalled}} the words later.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's why you haven't wasted {{any time}} {{learning}} Five Hundred and things, isn't it? Because you've <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> reading and <b>so</b> on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I say a thing, I mean it," [...] Mr. Crewe declared. [...] "I don't pay compliments. I'd {{make it a}} {{point to}} take a little time off to talk to you. You see, so many men are {{interested}} in this thing from various parts of the State, and we <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> organizing, that it absorbs most of my day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{never forget}} you, papa; but I {{do want to}} do {{something}} beautiful that you may be proud of me by and by. Mamma often tells me to stop; but when we get in here we forget there is any world outside, we <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> and so happy. Now I'll go and run and sing, and be a girl to please you.' And throwing away the apron, Bess vanished from the room, seeming to take all the light with her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see I {{feel as if}} Aunt Peace {{would like}} to do {{something}} for me, and I've found out what it can be. You know she can't go about like Aunty Plen, and we <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> nowadays that she is rather lonely, I'm afraid. So I want to take lessons in sewing of her. She works so beautifully, and it is a useful thing, you know, and I ought to be a good needlewoman as well as housekeeper, oughtn't I?" ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{sometimes}} {{wonder if}} the kind spirits who feel an interest in mortals ever {{take a look at}} us on the shady side which we don't show the world, seeing the trouble, vanities, and sins which we think no one knows. If they love, pity, or condemn us? What records they keep, and what rewards they prepare for those who <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> with their work and play that they forget who may be watching their back windows with clearer eyes and truer charity than any inquisitive old lady with a pen in her hand? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But what sudden {{noise is}} that he hears within the house? Why do those heavy steps press so rapidly against the stairs? What feet are they which <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> in the room above him? He opens the sitting-room door, but he can see nothing. He has been left there without a candle. He peers up the stairs, but a faint glimmer of light shining through the keyhole of his wife's door is all that meets his eye. 'Oh, my aunt! my aunt!' {{he says as he}} leans against the banisters. 'My aunt, my aunt, my aunt!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Don't get {{to feeling}} good too soon, Bunny.

Sonny and I have nearly finished making another door, and {{the best thing you can}} do is to close up the front one while Mr. Foxy Fox and Mr. Towser <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy.</b> Then we'll go over and visit your cousins till we can build a new house, for I wouldn't stay in this one another night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No: {{they have}} <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> setting, {{they have had}} no time for picnics yet. But they will let us know, if they {{discover}} any." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{you have}} <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> down {{there at the}} Yard, I thought that, as you <b>was</b> asking <b>so</b> many questions, you was, perhaps, {{interested}} in the matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How long? Since the {{day before}} yesterday. I never <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> in my life. The duke, as usual, wants to have {{everything}} done at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{has always}} been a mystery to me,' he said, 'why they never seem to think of manhandling the Johnny who does that to them. They don't seem able to connect cause and effect. I suppose {{the only way they can}} figure it out is that the bottom has {{suddenly}} dropped out of everything, and they <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> lighting out for home that they haven't time to go to the root of things. But it's a ticklish job, for all that, if you're not used to it. I know when I first did it I shut my eyes and wondered whether they would bury my remains or cremate them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The service I ask of you," [...] he resumed, [...] "will {{be easily}} rendered. The {{proprietor}} {{of a commercial}} establishment at Hanau is desirous of entering into business-relations with us, and has sent references to respectable persons in the town and neighborhood, which {{it is necessary to}} verify. We <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> in the office that it is impossible for me to leave Frankfort myself, or to employ our clerks on this errand. I have drawn out the necessary instructions--and Hanau, as you are aware, is within an easy distance of Frankfort. Have you any objection to be the representative of the house in this matter?" ...|$|E
60|$|Whether it {{were the}} dames, or the canal, or more likely still, some touch of atmosphere, but I was {{reminded}} of Holland. Indeed, I know not what the special occasion was. It is a strange fabric we <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> weaving out of sensations. Let something accidentally pick up an old thread, and behold, without rhyme or reason, we are treated to a whole piece of past experience. Stranger yet when but the background is brought back. For we were unconscious of the warp while the details were weaving in. Yet reproduce it and all the woof starts suddenly to sight. For atmosphere, like a perfume, does ghostly service to the past.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] replied Miriam, [...] "some of it doesn't get done, {{and some}} of it I am helped with. Mike does ever so much; he makes the fires, and carries the heavy things, and {{sometimes}} even cooks. My brother Ralph helps, too, when there is anything he can do, which is not often; but just now they <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> with their hay that it is harder upon me than it was before. We have had soda biscuit and all that sort of thing, but I saw that Ralph was getting tired of them; and to-day I thought I would try and make some real bread,--though how it is going to turn out, I don't know." ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR BROWN,--I hope, {{if you get}} thus far, {{you will}} know what an {{invaluable}} present I have made you. Even the copy was dear to me, printed in the colony that Penn established, and carried in my pocket all about the San Francisco streets, read in street cars and ferry-boats, when I was sick unto death, and found in all times and places a peaceful and sweet companion. But I hope, when you shall have reached this note, my gift will {{not have been in}} vain; for while just now we <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> and intelligent, there is not the man living, no, nor recently dead, that could put, with so lovely a spirit, so much honest, kind wisdom into words.|$|E

The present Duke, returning from exile, found his Land in desolation, much of it [...] "running fast to wild forest again;" [...] and he has signalized himself by unwearied efforts in every direction to put new life into it, which have been rather successful. Lyttelton, we perceive, finds improvement in his company. The name of this brave Duke is Leopold; age now forty-nine; life and reign not far from done: a man about whom even Voltaire gets into enthusiasm. [Siecle de Louis XIV.
