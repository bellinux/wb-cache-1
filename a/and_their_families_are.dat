25|$|University Park (UPK) is {{a complex}} of two story {{buildings}} that include 40 studio, 86 one-bedroom, and 80 two-bedroom unfurnished apartments. UPK is located near the URMC, directly across from Southside off of Kendrick Road. Graduate students <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> the primary occupants of these apartments, but some non-traditional undergraduate students are housed here who have been deemed too old for traditional undergraduate housing on the River Campus. Students who live here typically take up residence year round.|$|E

25|$|This war is {{notorious for}} the British {{scorched}} earth policy, which was implemented {{when it became}} clear that the guerrilla tactics practiced by the republican Boer forces could not be overcome by conventional means. In 1901, Emily Hobhouse reported on the genocide which was taking place in the 45 British concentration camps for Boer women, children and elderly in which, over an 18-month period, 26,370 people would die, 24,000 of them boys and girls under 16. Exact mortality figures in the 64 concentration camps for black displaced farm workers <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> not known, but was probably even worse.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the church}} had a paid local clergy in the 1800s, local and {{regional}} priesthood leaders currently serve as volunteers. Non-clerical church employees, general authorities (who serve life or five-year terms), and mission presidents are paid a stipend from church funds and provided other benefits. A general missionary fund covers the basic living expenses of single Mormon missionaries. Missionaries <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> asked to contribute to this fund, and in the United States the missionary's congregation of origin is ultimately responsible to satisfy the monthly obligation to the general fund. Members volunteer general custodial work for local church facilities.|$|E
25|$|Management {{decisions}} {{are more difficult}} for a moderately or severely undervirilized genetic male whose testes are in the abdomen and whose genitalia look {{at least as much}} female as male. Male sex can assigned and major reconstructive surgery done to close the midline of the perineum and move the testes into a constructed scrotum. Female sex can be assigned and the testes removed and vagina enlarged surgically. A recently advocated third choice would be to assign either sex and defer surgery to adolescence. Each approach carries its own disadvantages and risks. Children <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> different enough that none of the courses is appropriate for all.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, Congress {{took up the}} reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which {{provides}} health care for about 6 million children and 670,000 adults from families who earn too much money to qualify for Medicare {{but not enough to}} afford health insurance. Congressional Democrats and many Republicans tried to expand the coverage of the program to other needy families, but they were opposed by President George W. Bush and other Republicans. In 2006, 5.4 million children were eligible but not enrolled in SCHIP or Medicaid, and 9.4 million total children were uninsured. Such children <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> often treated in emergency rooms of hospitals, a much more expensive alternative for taxpayers than expanding the SCHIP and similar programs.|$|E
25|$|Jacob and {{his sons}} are forced by famine to go down into Egypt, {{although}} Joseph was already there, {{as he had been}} sold into slavery while young. When they arrive they <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> 70 in number, but within four generations they have increased to 600,000 men of fighting age, and the Pharaoh of Egypt, alarmed, first enslaves them and then orders the death of all male Hebrew children. A woman from the tribe of Levi hides her child, places him in a woven basket, and sends him down the Nile river. He is named Mosheh, or Moses, by the Egyptians who find him. Being a Hebrew baby, they award a Hebrew woman the task of raising him, the mother of Moses volunteers, and the child and his mother are reunited.|$|E
25|$|For dead donors, {{the process}} begins with verifying {{that the person}} is hopelessly dead, {{determining}} whether any organs could be donated, and obtaining consent for the donation of any usable organs. Normally, nothing is done until the person has already died, although if death is inevitable, it is possible to check for consent and to do some simple medical tests shortly beforehand, to help find a matching recipient. The verification of death is normally done by a neurologist (a physician specializing in brain function) that is not involved in the previous attempts to save the patient's life. This physician {{has nothing to do with}} the transplantation process. Verification of death is often done multiple times, to prevent doctors from overlooking any remaining sign of life, however small. After death, the hospital may keep the body on a mechanical ventilator and use other methods to keep the organs in good condition. Donors <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> not charged for any expenses related to the donation.|$|E
40|$|In the {{following}} project we concern ourselves {{with a group}} of danish volunteers who fought in the Waffen SS during WWII, how they <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>were</b> met with defiance in danish society, and more importantly why? Approximately 6000 danes actively fought for the german army. By joining ranks with Waffen SS and thereby the Nazi cause, they isolated themselves from society. They had crossed a line, and were consequently labelled as traitors by large segments of the danish population. The gradual stigmatisation that followed did not only affect the volunteers, but also <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> The volunteers <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>were</b> {{on the wrong side of}} the line that seperated the danish population from the german occupying force. By analysing police reports that deal with the relationship between the german occupying force (including the danish volunteers) and danish civilians, we give an account of the defiance the volunteers <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>were</b> subjected to. Furthermore, we show how the sense of a national togetherness that became increasingly present during the war, and specific events that took place during the occupation, were the main sources of the defiance and stigmatisation, the volunteers <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>were</b> subjected to...|$|R

25|$|Most of Tajikistan's {{environmental}} problems {{are related to}} the agricultural policies imposed on the country during the Soviet period. By 1991 heavy use of mineral fertilizers and agricultural chemicals was a major cause of pollution in the republic. Among those chemicals were DDT, banned by international convention, and several defoliants and herbicides. In addition to the damage they have done to the air, land, and water, the chemicals have contaminated the cottonseeds whose oil is used widely for cooking. Cotton farmers <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> at particular risk from the overuse of agricultural chemicals, both from direct physical contact in the field and from the use of the branches of cotton plants at home for fuel. All of these toxic sources are believed to contribute to a high incidence of maternal and child mortality and birth defects. In 1994 the infant mortality rate was 43.2 per 1,000 births, the second highest rate among former Soviet republics. The rate in 1990 had been 40.0 infant deaths per 1,000 births.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{members of}} the {{military}} <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> stationed worldwide and must often travel great distances for specialized medical care, Fisher House Foundation donates [...] "comfort homes," [...] built on the grounds of major military and VA medical centers.

2500|$|Dialog {{between what}} were once {{antagonistic}} groups of activists and clinicians {{has led to}} only slight changes in medical policies and how intersex patients <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> treated in some locations. In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. Many civil society organizations and human rights institutions now call {{for an end to}} unnecessary [...] "normalizing" [...] interventions, including in the Malta declaration.|$|E

2500|$|Howard Allan Stern {{was born}} on January 12, 1954, the second child of Ben and Ray (née Schiffman) Stern {{who lived in the}} Jackson Heights {{neighborhood}} of Queens in New York City. His parents are Jewish, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> from Poland and Austria-Hungary. Ray was an office clerk in New York City before she became a homemaker and later took up work as an inhalation therapist. Ben served in the U.S. army in Long Island and California during the war, and later worked as a radio engineer at WHOM in Manhattan and as a co-owner and operator at Aura Recording Inc., a Manhattan recording studio where cartoons and commercials were cut. Stern described his older sister Ellen as the [...] "complete opposite" [...] of himself and [...] "very quiet".|$|E
2500|$|The Baldwin–Felts men {{then turn}} their {{attention}} on the strikers' camp outside town, where the miners <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> living in tents. At night, the armed strikebreakers fire shots into the camp, injuring some strikers. The next day, they enter the camp to demand that all food and clothing purchased at the company store with scrip {{be turned over to}} them. But then some armed foothill people, whose land was taken by the coal company, enter the camp. Expressing disdain for the noise caused by the gunmen's automobile the night before, their presence and sympathy for the miners compels the Baldwin–Felts men to leave empty-handed. One of the hill people is carrying a caplock rifle and when asked mockingly by a departing Baldwin–Felts agent if it was a relic from the Spanish–American War, he replied, [...] "Nope, War Between the States".|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "CSI effect" [...] is a {{reference}} to the alleged phenomenon of CSI raising crime victims' and jury members' real-world expectations of forensic science, especially crime scene investigation and DNA testing. This is said to have changed the way many trials are presented today, in that prosecutors are pressured to deliver more forensic evidence in court. Victims <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> coming to expect instant answers from showcased techniques such as DNA analysis and fingerprinting, when actual forensic processing often takes days or weeks, with no guarantee of revealing a [...] "smoking gun" [...] for the prosecution's case. District attorneys state that the conviction rate in cases with little physical evidence has decreased, largely due to the influence of CSI on jury members. Some police and district attorneys have criticized the show for giving members of the public an inaccurate perception of how police solve crimes.|$|E

In her maiden speech she said: [...] "There is a real concern that the coalition will use the country's financial deficit as an excuse to unfairly target working people, particularly those who have been left dealing with the devastating effects of exposure to asbestos. With the backing of trade unions and support groups a huge amount of effort has gone into making sure that the voices of asbestos victims <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> <b>are</b> heard by Government and as a result a number of important assurances were made to them {{at the end of the}} last Parliament. It's vital those commitments are not reneged upon to the detriment of thousands of asbestos victims across the country." ...|$|E
