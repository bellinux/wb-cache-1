5|$|The Directive also prescribes how herd {{books are}} managed, and, of {{particular}} {{relevance to the}} French Limousin Herd Book, requires that EU member countries do not oppose the entry in their herd books of purebred breeding <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> the same breed from other member countries.|$|E
5|$|Transparency is common, even dominant, in <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> {{the open}} sea, {{especially}} those that live in relatively shallow waters. It is found in plankton of many species, as well as larger animals such as jellyfish, salps (floating tunicates), and comb jellies.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids also exhibit both {{schooling}} and shoaling behaviours. Very young bigfin reef squids will also stay close together (shoaling), {{but do not}} swim together {{parallel to each other}} (schooling). Unlike most other squid species, bigfin reef squids are rarely cannibalistic. Shoals can include <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> different sizes without the threat of larger members attacking and consuming the smaller members. Whether bigfin reef squids recognise each other individually still remains unknown.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle's {{writings}} on biology, {{the first in}} the history of science, are scattered across several books, forming about a quarter of his writings that have survived. The main biology texts were the History <b>of</b> <b>Animals,</b> Generation <b>of</b> <b>Animals,</b> Movement <b>of</b> <b>Animals,</b> Progression <b>of</b> <b>Animals,</b> Parts <b>of</b> <b>Animals,</b> and On the Soul, as well as the lost drawings of The Anatomies which accompanied the History.|$|R
5|$|Height is not {{the sole}} {{criterion}} for distinguishing horses from ponies. Breed registries for horses that typically produce individuals both under and over 14.2h consider all <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> that breed to be horses regardless of their height. Conversely, some pony breeds may have features in common with horses, and individual animals may occasionally mature at over 14.2h, but are still considered to be ponies.|$|E
5|$|In many <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> {{the deep}} sea, {{including}} several squid species, bacterial bioluminescence {{is used for}} camouflage by counterillumination, in which the animal matches the overhead environmental light as seen from below. In these animals, photoreceptors control the illumination to match {{the brightness of the}} background. These light organs are usually separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria. However, in one species, Euprymna scolopes, the bacteria are an integral component of the animal's light organ.|$|E
5|$|Premastication and mouth-to-mouth feeding {{in humans}} is {{postulated}} to have {{evolved from the}} regurgitation of food from parent to offspring or male to female (courtship feeding) and has been observed in numerous mammals and <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> other species. For instance, food begging behaviour observed in young wolves, wild dogs and certain gulls species, which involves the young approaching the beak or mouth of the adult with their own whereupon gaping their mouths or nuzzling, the adult would regurgitate portions of food to feed the young. However, in the aforementioned animals, this nuzzling behaviour {{and other types of}} mouth-to-mouth contact are also used for bonding, socialization, and courtship.|$|E

5|$|Romanesque art, {{especially}} metalwork, was at {{its most}} sophisticated in Mosan art, in which distinct artistic personalities including Nicholas of Verdun (d. 1205) become apparent, and an almost classical style is seen in works such as a font at Liège, contrasting with the writhing <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> the exactly contemporary Gloucester Candlestick. Large illuminated bibles and psalters were the typical forms of luxury manuscripts, and wall-painting flourished in churches, often following a scheme with a Last Judgement on the west wall, a Christ in Majesty at the east end, and narrative biblical scenes down the nave, or in the best surviving example, at Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe, on the barrel-vaulted roof.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> the far north, {{like the}} showshoe and Arctic hares, Arctic fox, stoat, and rock {{ptarmigan}} change their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey summer camouflage to {{white in the}} winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round. Since these animals in widely separated groups have evolved separately, the similarity of coloration is due to convergent evolution, on the presumption that natural selection favours a particular coloration in a particular environment.|$|E
5|$|The 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) is {{the only}} global {{organization}} that conserves {{a broad range of}} <b>animals,</b> <b>of</b> which includes marine mammals. Of the agreements made, three of them deal with the conservation of marine mammals: ACCOBAMS, ASCOBANS, and the Wadden Sea Agreement. In 1982, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) adopted a pollution prevention approach to conservation, which many other conventions at the time also adopted.|$|E

5|$|The growing {{consensus}} about the endothermy of dinosaurs (see dinosaur physiology) helps {{to understand their}} full extinction in contrast with their close relatives, the crocodilians. Ectothermic ("cold-blooded") crocodiles have very limited needs for food (they can survive several months without eating) while endothermic ("warm-blooded") <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> similar size need much more food to sustain their faster metabolism. Thus, under the circumstances of food chain disruption previously mentioned, non-avian dinosaurs died, while some crocodiles survived. In this context, the survival of other endothermic animals, such as some birds and mammals, could be due, among other reasons, to their smaller needs for food, related to their small size at the extinction epoch.|$|E
5|$|The larger Welsh mammals {{died out}} during the Norman period, {{including}} the brown bear, wolf and the wildcat. Today, mammals of note include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse, are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area. Other <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> note include, otter, stoat and weasel. The pine marten which has had the occasional sighting, has not been officially recorded since the 1950s. The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats {{can be found in}} Snowdonia.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{posed by}} the ratio is that the {{multiple}} specimens studied, died in the same place, but probably not in a sudden mass-death and so do not represent a single herd or contemporary population. The results may have been distorted by a greater chance for robust <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> getting fossilised or discovered. In an earlier study by Galton in 1982, {{it was suggested that}} individual difference in the sacral rib count of both Kentrosaurus and Dacentrurus might be an indication of dimorphism: females would have had an extra pair of sacral ribs, having also the first sacral vertebra connected to the ilium, in addition to the subsequent four sacrals.|$|E

5|$|The rampant and {{unsustainable}} hunting was {{not just}} financially motivated: it also had a more philosophical, fatalistic aspect. The conventional wisdom among New Zealand Europeans in the 19th century was that things colonial, whether they were plants, animals or people, were inferior to things European. It was widely assumed that the plants and <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> New Zealand's forest ecosystems would be quickly replaced by more vigorous and competitive European species. This assumption of inevitable doom led to a conclusion that the conservation of native biota was pointless and futile; Victorian collectors instead focused their efforts on acquiring a good range of specimens before the rare species disappeared altogether.|$|E
5|$|The tiger {{has been}} one of the big five game <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> Asia. Tiger hunting took place on a large scale in the early 19th and 20th centuries, being a {{recognised}} and admired sport by the British in colonial India as well as the maharajas and aristocratic class of the erstwhile princely states of pre-independence India. A single maharaja or English hunter could claim to kill over a hundred tigers in their hunting career. Tiger hunting was done by some hunters on foot; others sat up on machans with a goat or buffalo tied out as bait; yet others on elephant-back.|$|E
5|$|Three main {{camouflage}} methods predominate in the oceans: transparency, reflection, and counterillumination. Transparency and reflectivity {{are most}} important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counterillumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres. Most <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> the open sea use {{at least one of}} these methods to camouflage themselves. Camouflage in relatively shallow waters is more like terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by animals in many different groups. These methods of camouflage are described in turn below.|$|E

5|$|Breeding {{experiments}} to study evolution and genetics. Laboratory mice, flies, fish, and worms are inbred through many generations to create strains with defined characteristics. These provide <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> a known genetic background, {{an important tool}} for genetic analyses. Larger mammals are rarely bred specifically for such studies due to their slow rate of reproduction, though some scientists take advantage of inbred domesticated animals, such as dog or cattle breeds, for comparative purposes. Scientists studying how animals evolve use many animal species to see how variations in where and how an organism lives (their niche) produce adaptations in their physiology and morphology. As an example, sticklebacks are now being used to study how many and which types of mutations are selected to produce adaptations in animals' morphology during the evolution of new species.|$|E
5|$|In Eurasia, many {{gray wolf}} populations {{are forced to}} subsist largely on {{livestock}} and garbage in areas with dense human activity, though wild ungulates such as moose, red deer, roe deer and wild boar are still the most important food sources in Russia and the more mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. Other prey species include reindeer, argali, mouflon, wisent, saiga, ibex, chamois, wild goats, fallow deer and musk deer. The prey <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> North American wolves have largely continued to occupy suitable habitats with low human density, and cases of wolves subsisting largely on garbage or livestock are exceptional. Animals preferred as prey by North American wolves include moose, white-tailed deer, elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, Dall's sheep, American bison, muskox and caribou.|$|E
