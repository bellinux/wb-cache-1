5|$|Shortly afterwards, Frieda, {{a friend}} of Esther who has never {{received}} any marriage proposals, tells Shira that Esther would have preferred that Yochay marry her {{in the event of}} her death. As a result, Shira tells Yochay that Frieda is more suitable, which he takes as <b>an</b> <b>affront.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lumumba's speech, {{broadcast}} {{live on the}} radio across the world, denounced colonialism and was interpreted as <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> to Belgium and Baudouin personally. While it was well-received within the Congo, it was widely condemned internationally as unnecessarily confrontational and for showing ingratitude {{at a time when}} Belgium had granted independence to the state. The speech nearly provoked a diplomatic incident between the Congo and Belgium and Lumumba later gave further speeches attempting to adopt a more conciliatory tone.|$|E

5|$|The lavish banquet {{was certain}} to be <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> to those {{suffering}} {{in a time of}} severe austerity, but it was reported in the L'Ami du peuple and other firebrand newspapers as nothing short of a gluttonous orgy. Worst of all, the papers all dwelt scornfully on the reputed desecration of the tricolor cockade; drunken officers were said to have stamped upon this symbol of the nation and professed their allegiance solely to the white cockade of the House of Bourbon. This embellished tale of the royal banquet became the source of intense public outrage.|$|E
5|$|Under Islamic tradition, burial at sea is {{considered}} inappropriate when other, preferred forms of burial are available, and several prominent Islamic clerics criticized the decision. Mohamed Ahmed el-Tayeb, {{the head of}} Al-Azhar University, Egypt's seat of Sunni Muslim learning, said the disposal of the body at sea was <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> to religious and human values. Scholars like el-Tayeb hold that sea burials can only be allowed in special cases where the death occurred aboard a ship, and that the regular practice should have occurred in this case—the body buried in {{the ground with the}} head pointing to Islam's holy city of Mecca.|$|E
5|$|Baron Yamaki (Sessue Hayakawa) is a {{fisherman}} who lives {{along with his}} daughter Toya San (Tsuru Aoki) on an island. The island is inhabited by Buddhists and Yamaki had been cursed by Buddha for <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> {{by one of his}} ancestors who in a murderous rage, defiled an altar of Buddha in the nearby temple. The curse was that if his daughter married anyone, then the nearby volcano would erupt. Toya finds it difficult to form relationships with boys because the village prophet Takeo (Thomas Kurihara) has spread the rumour that she is cursed. She is therefore unwilling to continue her father's acceptance of the curse. When Yamaki takes Toya-san to the Buddha shrine in the garden of his house to pray and try to get the curse removed, she vents her feelings about the god's unfairness.|$|E

5|$|France and Austria {{signed a}} truce on 4 December and the Treaty of Pressburg 22 days later took the latter {{out of the}} war. Austria agreed to {{recognize}} French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Baden, which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities, and Venice {{was given to the}} Kingdom of Italy. It was a harsh end for Austria, but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} year in office, Clarke {{established}} good order in the colony. Unlike Osborn, who treated Colenso's presence at the trials in 1888 as <b>an</b> <b>affront,</b> Clarke took up Colenso's cause and recommended to the Colonial Office in London that Dinuzulu and his uncles be allowed to return from exile, having been sufficiently punished for his supposed offences. Clarke, persuaded by Colenso, argued that Dinuzulu would not cause further trouble so long as the policy of fomenting intertribal strife were discontinued and Dinuzulu be appointed induna. He began the process for the return of Dinuzulu and sought to harness the authority of the Zulu leader to the administration. In January 1895, the exiles received notice of their return to Zululand with an official position for Dinuzulu. Their departure was set for February 1895 but was delayed after Ministers in London recommended that Zululand first be annexed to Natal.|$|E
5|$|Sihanouk, who by now had {{tired of}} the {{political}} squabbling, dissolved the assembly in September 1949, but opted to rule by decree {{for the next two}} years before general elections were held, which the Democrats won. In October 1951 Thanh returned to Cambodia and was received by 100,000 supporters, a spectacle which Sihanouk saw as <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> to his regal authority. Thanh disappeared six months later, presumably to join the Khmer Issarak. Sihanouk ordered the Democrat-led government to arrest Thanh but was ignored. Subsequently, civil demonstrations rallying against the monarchy and the French broke out in the countryside, alarming Sihanouk, who began to suspect that the Democrats had played a complicit role in them. In June 1952 Sihanouk dismissed the Democrat nominee Huy Kanthoul and made himself prime minister. A few days later, Sihanouk privately confided in exasperation to the US chargé d'affaires, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, that parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for Cambodia.|$|E

5|$|The nature {{artist and}} the fantasy artist in Potter are at odds: the mouse, the toad, and the insects share the same habitat but there seems no logical reason for the mouse and the toad to be {{humanised}} while the insects remain their natural selves. Logically, they should be humanised, too. While the toad is an invader like the insects, he does Mrs. Tittlemouse the service of ridding her house of the bees yet is inexplicably excluded from the party, <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> to the reader's sense of social right and wrong. It is possible Potter's carelessness {{in the details of}} Mrs. Tittlemouse can be attributed to a desire on her part to simply display her ability to draw from nature or to her interest in book production being supplanted by a growing interest in farming and local life and politics in Sawrey.|$|E
5|$|While ashore {{during the}} peace Macnamara {{contrived}} to become {{embroiled in a}} duel. While walking his Newfoundland dog in Hyde Park on 6 April 1803 he had an altercation with Colonel Robert Montgomery, when their dogs began fighting. Harsh words were exchanged, and the two parties fought a duel that evening at Chalk Farm. Both men were wounded, the colonel mortally. Macnamara was arrested {{on a charge of}} manslaughter and put on trial at the Old Bailey on 22 April. Macnamara defended himself from the charge on the grounds that he had received <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> and that it was necessary for him to challenge it in order to maintain his position as a naval officer. He summoned many of his naval friends, among whom Viscounts Hood and Nelson, Lord Hotham, Sir Hyde Parker, Sir Thomas Troubridge, Captains Martin, Towry, Lydiard, Moore and Waller; and General Churchill and Lord Minto, to testify in his defence. They supported his assertion that he was the 'reverse of quarrelsome' and the jury took ten minutes to acquit him.|$|E
5|$|During the 1840s and 1850s, {{a flurry}} of railroad-building {{activity}} led to the completion of four separate railroads converging in Erie. A break of gauge between the the Erie and North East Railroad and the Franklin Canal Companyensured that the citizens of Erie profited from the delays necessary to transfer cargo between the lines. When it was proposed in 1853 to standardize the track gauge to allow through traffic, a conflict that {{became known as the}} Erie Gauge War ensued. The residents of Erie, who saw it as <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> to their desire that the city become a major lake port, dismantled railroad bridges and tore up railroad tracks in the city in an effort to prevent the impending standardization. As part of the dispute's settlement, both railroads provided financial support for the construction of the Erie and Pittsburgh and Sunbury and Erie railroads. The Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad acquired the Franklin Canal Company in 1854, and the Erie and North East was merged with the Buffalo and State Line to form the Buffalo and Erie Railroad a few years later. The Sunbury and Erie was renamed the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad in 1861. The Pennsylvania Railroad soon acquired the Sunbury and Erie through a 999-year lease and funded completion of the line by 1864.|$|E
