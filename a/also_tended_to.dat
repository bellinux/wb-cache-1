5|$|Lighting {{also served}} Gaudí for the {{organisation}} of space, which required a careful {{study of the}} gradient of light intensity to adequately adapt to each specific environment. He achieved this with different elements such as skylights, windows, shutters and blinds; a notable case is the gradation of colour used in the atrium of the Casa Batlló to achieve uniform distribution of light throughout the interior. He <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> build south-facing houses to maximise sunlight.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War, remnants of the United States Asiatic Fleet fled to Australia, on orders from Washington. The S-boats from the Philippines were organized into a fighting force at Brisbane, and Admiral Ernest King ordered S-boats from the Atlantic Fleet to supplement the force in Australia. Christie went along, arriving in April 1942, {{just in time for the}} Battle of the Coral Sea. During the Solomon Islands campaign, he ordered his boats to patrol around harbors which, while being key points for shipping, <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be heavily patrolled by aircraft and anti-submarine craft. In step with then-current U.S. Navy submarine doctrine, he made capital ships the prime targets, rather than have his boats focus on merchant shipping.|$|E
25|$|Like evangelicals {{in other}} Protestant denominations, they {{stressed}} the need for a conversion experience and participated in the revivalism of the Second Great Awakening, holding revival meetings and prayer meetings. They <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> disapprove of social amusements such as dancing, card-playing, and the theatre.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{and colleagues}} {{generally}} agree that Shockley {{was a poor}} manager and businessman. From early childhood he was prone to outbursts of unprovoked aggression, which were suppressed due to the internal discipline of his past working environment. He <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> see rivals, even in his own subordinates.|$|E

25|$|Women {{also began}} to wear caps known as a cornette around 1816. These caps were tied under the chin and worn indoors. They <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be greatly adorned with plumes, ribbons, flowers, and jewels. Another {{alternative}} to the cornette was the turban, also often bejeweled and adorned, which shows the great interest in exotic cultures.|$|E
25|$|While several {{third-party}} projects (e.g. GNU Classpath and Apache Harmony) created {{free software}} partial Java implementations, the large {{size of the}} Sun libraries combined {{with the use of}} clean room methods meant that their implementations of the Java libraries (the compiler and VM are comparatively small and well defined) were incomplete and not fully compatible. These implementations <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be far less optimized than Sun's.|$|E
25|$|In the {{earliest}} days of railways in the United Kingdom, most lines were built as double-track because of the difficulty of co-ordinating operations before the invention of the telegraph. The lines <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be busy enough to be beyond the capacity of a single track. In the early days the Board of Trade did not consider any single-track railway line to be complete.|$|E

25|$|Although the Bumiputra {{have always}} been the largest racial segment of the Malaysian {{population}} (about 65%), their economic position has <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be precarious. As late as 1970, 13 years after the drafting of the constitution, they controlled only 4% of the economy, with much of the rest being held by Chinese and foreign interests. As a result, the Reid Commission had recommended the drafting of Article 153 to address this economic imbalance.|$|E
25|$|Though Cavaignac, Pinet and Pierre-Arnaud Dartigoeyte {{were soon}} replaced, the new representatives such as Pierre-Anselm Garrau <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> meddle in {{military}} decisions. As troublesome as the representatives could be, {{it is also}} true that no Army of the Western Pyrenees army commander was guillotined. The army was supposed to be reinforced from the Vendée by 15,000 troops but only 3,000 foot soldiers and 500 horsemen arrived in mid-September. For the fall 1794 offensive, Moncey's army numbered 52,000 troops in 64 battalions and four cavalry regiments. During the winter, an epidemic killed 3,000 soldiers and many inhabitants in the occupied areas of Spain.|$|E
25|$|He <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> {{engage in}} {{sledging}} of opposition batsmen and teams, though it didn't always pay off. Before the 2005 Ashes series he predicted a 5–0 whitewash for Australia, and even {{said that if}} England won the Ashes {{he would return to}} Australia by boat, but England prevailed 2–1. However, this did not dissuade him from making a similar 5–0 prediction for the next Ashes series, in Australia in 2006/07 {{which turned out to be}} true. He finished his career as the most successful Test fast-bowler and 3rd highest Test wicket taker. However his Test wicket haul was surpassed by Indian leg-spinner Anil Kumble during India's tour of England 2007.|$|E
50|$|Although several {{statistical}} packages (e.g., SPSS, SAS) {{report the}} Wald statistic {{to assess the}} contribution of individual predictors, the Wald statistic has limitations. When the regression coefficient is large, the standard error of the regression coefficient <b>also</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> be large increasing the probability of Type-II error. The Wald statistic <b>also</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> be biased when data are sparse.|$|R
50|$|Political {{factors such}} as {{lobbying}} of government by polluters may <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> reduce {{the level of the}} tax levied, which will <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> reduce the mitigating effect of the tax; lobbying of government by special interests who calculate the negative utility of the externality higher than others may <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> increase the level of the tax levied, which will <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> result in a sub-optimal level of production.|$|R
50|$|The English Cocker Spaniel {{is similar}} to the English Springer Spaniel and at first glance the only major {{difference}} is the larger size of the Springer. However English Cockers <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> have longer, and lower-set ears than English Springers. In addition Springers <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> have a longer muzzle, their eyes are not as prominent and the coat is less abundant.|$|R
25|$|Indigenous Australians have {{a complex}} oral {{tradition}} and spiritual values based upon {{reverence for the}} land and {{a belief in the}} Dreaming. The Dreaming is at once the ancient time of creation and the present day reality of Dreaming. There were a great many different groups, each with their own individual culture, belief structure, and language. These cultures overlapped {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, and evolved over time. The Rainbow Serpent is a major dream spirit for Aboriginal people across Australia. The Yowie and Bunyip are other well known dream spirits. At the time of the British settlement, traditional religions were animist and <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> have elements of ancestor worship.|$|E
25|$|Land {{issues and}} {{predominantly}} Jewish presence among estate leaseholders {{accounted for the}} 1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt, partly antisemitic in message. During the same period, the anti-Jewish message first expanded beyond its National Liberal base (where it was soon an insignificant attitude), to cover the succession of more radical and Moldavian-based organizations founded by A.C. Cuza (his Democratic Nationalist Party, created in 1910, had the first antisemitic program in Romanian political history). No longer present in the PNL's ideology by the 1920s, antisemitism <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> surface in on the left-wing of the political spectrum, in currents originating in Poporanism - which favoured the claim that peasants were being systematically exploited by Jews.|$|E
25|$|From 1682 the {{production}} of new plays dropped sharply, affected both by a merger between the two companies and by the political turmoil of the Popish Plot (1678) and the Exclusion crisis (1682). The 1680s were especially lean years for comedy, the only exception being the remarkable career of Aphra Behn, whose achievement as the first professional British woman dramatist {{has been the subject}} of much recent study. There was a swing away from comedy to serious political drama, reflecting preoccupations and divisions following on the political crisis. The few comedies produced <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be political in focus, the whig dramatist Thomas Shadwell sparring with the tories John Dryden and Aphra Behn.|$|E

25|$|In 1541, with Protestantism in the ascendancy, John Calvin, {{the founder}} of Calvinism, became the spiritual leader of the city. By the 18th century, however, Geneva had come under the {{influence}} of Catholic France, which cultivated the city as its own. France <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be at odds with the ordinary townsfolk, which inspired the failed Geneva Revolution of 1782 in an attempt to win representation in the government for men of modest means. In 1798, revolutionary France under the Directory annexed Geneva. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, on 1 June 1814, Geneva was admitted to the Swiss Confederation. In 1907, the separation of Church and State was adopted. Geneva flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries, becoming the seat of many international organizations.|$|E
25|$|Hereafter, the war progressed further {{towards the}} many smaller {{states of the}} Western Regions. The nature of the battles varied through time with many {{casualties}} during the changes of possession or loss of actual control over the western states near the frontier regions. Regional alliances <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> shift or get broken forcibly depending on the situation as one party gained {{the upper hand in}} a certain territory over the other. The Han empire's political influence expanded deeply into Central Asia. As the situation deteriorated for the Xiongnu, civil war befell and weakened the confederation. Eventually, the Southern Xiongnu submitted to the Han empire while the Northern Xiongnu continued to resist. Marked by significant events involving the conquests over various smaller states for control and many large-scale battles, the war resulted in the total victory of the Han empire over the Xiongnu state in 89 AD.|$|E
25|$|After {{establishing}} {{authority over}} the LAF in 1945, the Lebanese government intentionally kept its armed forces small and weak due to the country's unique internal politics. Christian politicians feared that Muslims might use the armed forces {{as a vehicle for}} seizing power in a military coup. They also appeared unwilling to incur the cost of maintaining a large well equipped army. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Lebanon never spent more than 4% of its GNP on the military budget. Many Christian Lebanese also feared that a large army would inevitably force Lebanon into the Arab–Israeli conflict. However, Muslim politicians were also worried that a strong army could be used against Muslim interests because it would be commanded by Christians. At the same time they tended to feel that the military should be strong enough to play a part in the Arab-Israeli struggle. In addition to the two major conflicting views, prominent Lebanese politicians of the myriad religious denominations in Lebanon have <b>also</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be feudal warlords commanding their own private militias and feared that a strong army would endanger their personal power.|$|E
50|$|Young {{adults and}} middle-aged parents with a pessimistic {{explanatory}} style often suffer from depression. They <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be poor at problem-solving and cognitive restructuring, and <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate poor {{job satisfaction and}} interpersonal relationships in the workplace. Those with a pessimistic style <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> have weakened immune systems, having not only increased vulnerability to minor ailments (e.g., cold, fever) and major illness (e.g., heart attack, cancers), but also poorer recovery from health problems.|$|R
