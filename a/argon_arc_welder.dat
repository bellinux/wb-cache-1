It is able to accomplish various kinds of welding procedures, such as direct-current TIG welding, alternating current TIG welding, pulse TIG welding, spot welding, manual metal-arc welding and others.

30|$|All {{pyrolysis}} {{experiments were}} {{performed in a}} gold-tube pyrolysis system at constant temperatures of 300, 330, 350, 360, 370, 390, 400 and 420  °C for time intervals between 24 and 360  h at a constant pressure of 50  MPa. These were carried out at the Petroleum Geology Research and Laboratory Center (PGRLC) of the Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development (Zhang et al. 2013). The error for the temperature was less than ± 1  °C. The tubes used in our experiments were 50  mm in length with an inner diameter (ID) of 4.0  mm and a wall thickness of 0.5  mm. The reactants were accurately measured and loaded into the tube. A series of anhydrous samples and two series of hydrous samples were loaded into the gold tubes. In anhydrous experiments, only 50  mg of kerogen samples were loaded, while in hydrous experiments samples were separated into two sets, one with kerogen plus 50  μg deionized water (δDH 2 O = − 55 ‰), {{and the other with}} the same amount of water and additional 50  mg of U-ore in order to magnify the impact of water and differentiate the effects of added minerals on the hydrocarbon generation. Air in the tube was removed by argon flow, and {{the other end of the}} tube was crimped and sealed by an <b>argon</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welder</b> with most of the sealed end submerged in liquid nitrogen. When reaction ended, the pressure was relieved, and the gold tubes were withdrawn. Before analysis, the tubes were weighed and compared with the preheated weight to determine whether leakage had occurred during pyrolysis.|$|E
40|$|Alveolar macrophages are {{essential}} components of pulmonary defense. They are unique among mononuclear phagocytes in having direct exposure to inhaled microorganisms and environmental toxins {{and in their}} metabolic adaptations to the aerobic environment. On the other hand, they {{are thought to have}} some properties common to all mononuclear phagocytes which constitute the reticuloendothelial system. Moreover, the ironladen alveolar macrophages seem {{to play a role in}} the induction of tissue injury and iron transport of the lung. In this experiment, the functions of alveolar macrophages, namely, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, β-galactosidase activity and superoxide production were studied in patients with <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung, other lung diseases and normal adults as controls. No significant difference was present in the chemotaxis of alveolar macrophages to zymosan activated serum between normal subjects and patients with <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung. The phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan particles by alveolar macrophages from patients with <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung was less than that of normal subjects. No significant difference was observed in the phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages between normal subjects and patients with lung diseases except for <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung. There was no significant difference in β-galactosidase activity of alveolar macrophages between normal subjects and patients with <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung. Superoxide production by alveolar macrophages from patients with <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung was significantly lower than of normal subjects. The observations reported here indicate that the functions of alveolar macrophages, especially phagocytosis and superoxide production, are suppressed in <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This article employs single {{closed loop}} of voltage {{negative}} feedback circle {{to explore the}} welding wire sending system of <b>arc</b> <b>welder,</b> as the system of this style has the feature of rough sending and poor dynamic behavior. A double closed loop PWM digit speed adjustment system is proposed based on fussy adaptive-adjusting PID control algorithm. The experiment result indicates that this control system not only has a sound dynamic behavior and static behavior but also has a strong self-adapting behavior, and mostly eliminates the arc flutter made by the rough welding wire sending system.

40|$|To {{develop a}} method for the early {{diagnosis}} of health damage due to arc welding, we measured serum ferritin in 96 general employees and 320 <b>arc</b> <b>welders</b> in Company A. A positive correlation was observed between age and the serum ferritin level in the young group (age, 20 - 44 years) among the general employees. The mean serum ferritin level in the general employees was 119 ± 56 ng/ml. When the mean ± 2. 5 SD {{was used as the}} standard value, ferritin levels > 260 ng / ml could be regarded as high. Based on this standard value, high ferritin levels were observed in 7 (6. 6 %) of 106 young <b>arc</b> <b>welders</b> in Company A but none of the general employees. Chest X-ray films showed minimal abnormality in one of 7 young <b>arc</b> <b>welders</b> who showed high ferritin levels.

40|$|Introduction Welding work is {{associated}} with the inhalation of fumes and accumulation of particulates in welders' lungs. It is assumed that particulates deposited in the respiratory system, mainly consisting of iron oxides, are eliminated by several mechanisms, such as muco-ciliary transport and macrophage phagocytosis. In their cross-sectional study of 42 Finnish shipyard <b>arc</b> <b>welders,</b> Kalliomki et al. indicated that from 10 to 20 % of total accumulated welding particulates from fumes was eliminated annually from welders' lungs [1]. However, longitudinal changes in the lung deposition of welding particulates have not yet been fully described. We previously reported a cross-sectional distribution of magnetopneumographic (MPG) measurements of Japanese electric <b>arc</b> <b>welders</b> [2].
