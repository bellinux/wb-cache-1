40|$|Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) {{disease is}} a growing {{healthcare}} burden. Besides theassociated cardiovascular comorbidities, the AAA itself poses a risk for the patient in two fashions. First, it could rupture, which is associated with high mortality and morbidity. This thesis focused on the second, more indirect, hazard the patient with an AAA is exposed to: the operative risk. Our aim was to improve patient outcome by seeking discrepancies in AAA expressions and repair. Variance and variants in AAA Screening for patients at risk for adverse events due to aneurysmal disease is currently based on traditional risk factors, which does not allow individual risk stratification. The instability of the vessel wall was previously {{shown to be a}} part a systemic process, and we show that local proteins predict postoperative cardiovascular adverse events. Currently no differences among AAAs have been established. In this thesis we demonstrate that half of the AAA had only very low amounts of wall inflammation, more pronounced intimal atherosclerosis, more atherosclerotic risk factors and more postoperative events, when compared to the AAA with moderate to severe inflammation. The low-inflammatory AAAs appeared more closely related to atherosclerosis, and might need a different therapeutic approach. Furthermore, we report that there is a regional variance in wall composition inside the AAA. Inflammation and proteases were more pronounced at the lateral sides of the AAA, suggesting decreased local wall strength. This location coincides with the most frequent site of rupture, and merits a prominent focus of (medication-related) research on the lateral wall. Improving outcome after repair Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) comprises the majority of AAA repairs, and various access types exist, which influence outcome. We compared percutaneous access (pEVAR) and femoral cutdown access (cEVAR) both in a tertiary university center and in a more national database, both in the USA. We found that in our hospital pEVAR is associated with an improved (local) outcome and lower operative time and lower hospital stay. However, these results could not be generalized to a national level as this mixture of centers demonstrated only minimal or <b>absent</b> <b>advantages</b> of pEVAR versus cEVAR. When zooming in on physician specialty and experience in a national database in the USA, we noted that vascular surgeons repaired an increasing proportion of AAA overall from 2001 to 2009. Mortality was higher with lower surgeon volumes, especially for open repair. Medium and high volumes decreased over time, suggesting that it will be increasingly hard to deliver good quality treatment. For EVAR, more physicians had medium or large volumes, thereby significantly improving outcome. Current and future advances in knowledge should lead to an individual approach with a tailored cut off for intervention and management of co-existing diseases. Ultimately, if AAAs are better understood, patients who need treatment because of a higher rupture risk can be identified better. Also, the AAA repair of patients who are at high-risk for postoperative mortality and morbidity should be postponed as long as possible to delay the burden of repair, ideally to be repaired just before AAA rupture...|$|E

In this paper, we propose a function of covariance matrix based algorithm to detect target under clutter environment. The sta-tistical covariance matrices with and without target are usually different, thus we can find the target present or <b>absent.</b> The <b>advantage</b> of proposed algorithm is it works effectively with limited sample data when target signal strength is very weak. The probabilities of detection versus SNR and ROC curves us-ing sinusoidal target on Rayleigh distribution clutter model, log-normal distribution clutter model, and Weibull distribution clutter model show that the algorithm is valid for different clut-ter models. ...|$|R

50|$|Modern {{technologies}} of production of ethylene glycol include the following. Shell OMEGA technology (Only Mono-Ethylene Glycol Advantage) is a two-step synthesis of ethylene carbonate using a phosphonium halide as a catalyst. The glycol yield is 99-99.5%, with other glycols practically <b>absent.</b> The main <b>advantage</b> {{of the process}} is production of pure ethylene glycol {{without the need for}} further purification. The first commercial plant which uses this method was opened in 2008 in South Korea. Dow METEOR (Most Effective Technology for Ethylene Oxide Reactions) is an integrated technology for producing ethylene oxide and its subsequent hydrolysis into ethylene glycol. The glycol yield is 90-93%. The main advantage of the process is relative simplicity, using fewer stages and less equipment.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} {{to measure the}} internal temperature of (Li-ion) batteries. Based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, an intercept frequency (f 0) can be determined which is exclusively related to the internal battery temperature. The intercept frequency {{is defined as the}} frequency at which the imaginary part of the impedance is zero (Zim = 0), i. e. where the phase shift between the battery current and voltage is <b>absent.</b> The <b>advantage</b> of the proposed method is twofold: (i) no hardware temperature sensors are required anymore to monitor the battery temperature and (ii) the method does not suffer from heat transfer delays. Mathematical analysis of the equivalent electrical-circuit, representing the battery performance, confirms that the intercept frequency decreases with rising temperatures. Impedance measurements on rechargeable Li-ion cells of various chemistries were conducted to verify the proposed method. These experiments reveal that the intercept frequency is clearly dependent on the temperature and does not depend on State-of-Charge (SoC) and aging. These impedance-based sensorless temperature measurements are therefore simple and convenient for application {{in a wide range of}} stationary, mobile and high-power devices, such as hybrid- and full electric vehicles...|$|R
40|$|This study compares gender {{differences}} in Healthy Life Years (HLY) and unhealthy life years (ULY) between the original (EU 15) and new member states (EU 10). Based {{on the number of}} deaths, population and prevalence of activity limitations from the Statistics of Living and Income Conditions Survey (SILC) survey, we calculated HLY and ULY for the EU 10 and EU 15 in 2006 with the Sullivan method. We used decomposition analysis to assess the contributions of mortality and disability and age to {{gender differences}} in HLY and ULY. HLY at age 15 for women in the EU 10 were 3. 1  years more than those for men at the same age, whereas HLY did not differ by gender in the EU 15. In both populations ULY at age 15 for women exceeded those for men by 5. 5  years. Decomposition showed that EU 10 women had more HLY because higher disability in women only partially offset (− 0. 8  years) the effect of lower mortality (+ 3. 9  years). In the EU 15 women’s higher disability prevalence almost completely offset women’s lower mortality. The 5. 3 fewer ULY in EU 10 men than in EU 10 women mainly reflected higher male mortality (4. 5  years), while the fewer ULY in EU 15 men than in EU 15 women reflected both higher male mortality (2. 9  years) and higher female disability (2. 6  years). The absence of a clear gender gap in HLY in the EU 15 thus masked important {{gender differences in}} mortality and disability. The similar size of the gender gap in ULY in the EU- 10 and EU- 15 masked the more unfavourable health situation of EU 10 men, in particular the much stronger and younger mortality disadvantage in combination with the virtually <b>absent</b> disability <b>advantage</b> below age 65 in men...|$|R
40|$|Restricted until 21 Sep. 2009. It is {{generally}} advantageous to spread information processing across both cerebral hemispheres as tasks become more complex. The present series of five experiments {{were designed to}} investigate whether introduction of a secondary task within a novel dual-task paradigm influences the pattern of interhemispheric collaboration without increasing the complexity of a primary comparison task. Recent {{research suggests that the}} advantage of spreading processing across both hemispheres is predicted to the extent that stimuli to be compared are likely to be processed in similar cortical pathways. To test how degree of cortical access route overlap may modulate hemispheric communication (CAR model), careful selection of primary and secondary stimulus formats was conducted.; For each of the five experiments of the present investigation, observers engaged in the following three types of conditions: (1) three-item comparison task (single primary task), (2) two-item comparison task (single secondary task), (3) three and two-item comparison task (dual-task). The critical comparison involved dual-task primary trials on which the two matching stimuli projected to the same visual field (within-hemisphere trials) versus trials on which the two matching stimuli projected to opposite visual fields (across-hemisphere trials). The results of Experiments 1 (all letters) and 2 (letters and pictures) showed support of the CAR model because an <b>absent</b> across-hemisphere <b>advantage</b> was established during the single primary task and neural overlap explained the across-hemisphere advantage found for the dual-task primary trials of the former but not the latter experiment. Experiments 3 to 5 involved a new application of the dimensions of numerical magnitude, physical size, and luminance to a dual-task paradigm. As an unexpected across-hemisphere advantage was found during the single primary task of experiments, interpretation of performance during the dual-task condition is limited. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 support the CAR model while the surprising findings of Experiments 3 to 5 do not provide an opportunity to test the model...|$|R

Here we assessed whether two distinct EEG neurofeedback protocols could develop surgical skill, given the important role this skill plays in medicine. Results National Health Service trainee ophthalmic microsurgeons (N = 20) were randomly assigned to either Sensory Motor Rhythm-Theta (SMR) or Alpha-Theta (AT) groups, a randomized subset of which were also part of a wait-list 'no-treatment' control group (N = 8). Neurofeedback groups received eight 30 -minute sessions of EEG training. Pre-post assessment included a skills lab surgical procedure with timed measures and expert ratings from video-recordings by consultant surgeons, together with state/trait anxiety self-reports. SMR training demonstrated <b>advantages</b> <b>absent</b> in the control group, with improvements in surgical skill according to 1) the expert ratings: overall technique (d = 0. 6, p Conclusion SMR-Theta neurofeedback training provided significant improvement in surgical technique whilst considerably reducing time on task by 26 %.

To accomplish this, U.

40|$|Although the {{negative}} impacts of volcanism on society are well documented and accepted, many possible benefits from volcanoes {{are not always}} fully considered. This paper provides suggestions for understanding and implementing volcanoes' benefits by suggesting further application of existing risk management frameworks to volcanology: living with risk by using the sustainable livelihoods approach at the local level. This paper presents an overview bringing established paradigms into volcanic risk management where they are sometimes <b>absent</b> despite their <b>advantages.</b> The sustainable livelihoods approach is important in its application to volcanic scenarios in four ways:(i) Understanding, communicating, and managing vulnerability and risk and local perceptions of vulnerability and risk beyond immediate threats to life. (ii) Maximising the benefits to communities of their volcanic environment, especially during quiescent periods, without increasing vulnerability. (iii) Managing crises. (iv) Managing reconstruction and resettlement after a crisis. An overview of case studies is provided showing how volcanic opportunities {{could be used for}} sustainable livelihoods. The approach of living with volcanic risks and benefits could be adopted and implemented {{as an integral part of}} changing perceptions of volcanoes and of managing volcano-related crisis and non-crisis situations. However, the sustainable livelihoods approach is not a panacea, so limitations are discussed along with why living near a volcano cannot solve all livelihood concerns. In particular, livelihood diversity and livelihood transferability to other locations assists in living with volcanoes. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

SMR training demonstrated <b>advantages</b> <b>absent</b> in the control group, with improvements in surgical skill according to 1) the expert ratings: overall technique (d = 0. 6, p < 0. 03) and suture task (d = 0. 9, p < 0. 02) (judges' intraclass correlation coefficient = 0. 85); and 2) with overall time on task (d = 0. 5, p = 0. 02), while everyday anxiety (trait) decreased (d = 0. 5, p < 0. 02). Importantly the decrease in surgical task time was strongly associated with SMR EEG training changes (p < 0. 01), especially with continued reduction of theta (4 – 7 Hz) power. AT training produced marginal improvements in technique and overall performance time, which were accompanied by a standard error indicative of large individual differences. Notwithstanding, successful within session elevation of the theta-alpha ratio correlated positively with improvements in overall technique (r = 0. 64, p = 0. 047).

40|$|The {{experience}} {{of working in}} VTs is greatly influenced by the characteristics of virtual environments (VE) in which they operate. They present certain <b>advantages</b> <b>absent</b> in face-to-face interactions such as the flexibility in time management (Burge: 1994), the possibility of revising conversations through archiving, the reduction of digressions by focusing conversation on task (Lopez-Ortiz and Lin: 2005) and low hierarchical structures (Warschauer: 1997). In addition, their asynchrony helps to build and share knowledge (Stacey: 1999) and it allows more reflection on posts (Sorensen: 2004). All these advantages have been highlighted with enthusiasm by the first authors interested in CMC (computer mediated communication). In their vision, technology tends to naturally improve collaboration. Hara and Kling (2000, p. 558) describe this position as a “promotional bias“. The original enthusiasm has not waned, but researchers, who multiply studies on their own teaching experiences with VEs, realize that some benefits of the technology can also become disadvantages. Indeed, if asynchrony is useful for learning by allowing a reflection on posted messages (Burge: 1994, Warschauer 1997; Stacey: 1999, Vonderwell: 2003) it becomes a problem in terms of interaction. It leads to delays that may be harmful to collaboration: discrepancies {{in the interpretation of}} messages (Finegold and Cooke: 2006), misunderstandings due to the absence of nonverbal cues (Kreijns et al. : 2003; Lopez-Ortiz and Lin: 2005), or frustration due to delays in feedback (Burge: 1994, Finegold and Cooke 2006). These limits imply that VTs generally communicate less efficiently (McDonough et al. : 2001) and less frequently (Webster and Wong 2008) than traditional teams. According to Axtell and her colleagues (2004), the greater the distance and the dispersion between team members, the lesser are opportunities for communication. Under these conditions, shortcomings in the development of shared knowledge and language appear which, in turn, further undermine communication (Crampton: 2001). ￼￼ Most researchers who mainly focus on the limitations of technology draw their inspiration from the theory of media richness (Daft and Lengel: 1986, Daft et al. : 1987). In this perspective, face-to-face interaction is considered the richest media available. Hence, constraints imposed by CMC diminish the quality of interactions due to the poverty of online medias (Axtell et al. : 2004). This theoretical approach, called the “cues-filtered-out“ paradigm following Culnan and Markus (1987), became the canonical position in the study of VTs. The main criticism addressed to this approach {{is that it does not}} take into account the effects of time. Walther (1992), for example, argues that cues alleged to be lost in CMC are in fact available but slow to take effect. Yet, not all VTs have time due to budgetary and profitability constraints or their temporary nature. Thus, to address the problems introduced by the use of CMC, practitioners and designers worked on enhancing the technology (Suthers: 2006). However, some believe that improved technology do not guarantee better collaboration within VTs. According to Axtell et al. (2004) the extent of CMC limitations also depends on the adaptability of users, one’s experience with the technology, communication partners and the context of interactions. We find it interesting to study how VTs members’ interpretative frameworks shape their collaborative experience. Several authors outline the importance of shared common grounds (knowledge, language and meaning) among members in VTs (including Cramton: 2001, Bjorn and Ngwenyama: 2009). Others, like Suthers (2006), discuss intersubjective meaning making to study collaborative learning in VEs. By cons, we found no studies on how the individual construction of meaning helps to shape the collective construction of meaning. Also, it seems interesting to widen the issue of construction of collective meaning in VTs focusing on sensemaking of individual members. We propose that the quality of a collaboration in a VT depends on which environmental cues individuals and the group decide to focus their attention. This research attempts to answer the following questions: 1. How do students make sense of their collaboration in VT? 2. How does individual sensemaking contribute to constructing collective sensemaking? In order to answer these questions, we adopt an interpretive stance and a narrative approach to study VT collaboration lived by students in Belgium and Quebec as part of a course taught simultaneously in a Belgian university and a Quebec university...|$|R
