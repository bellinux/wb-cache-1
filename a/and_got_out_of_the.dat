Gelman then went to the house of a female {{acquaintance}} named Yelena Bulchenko, where he killed her mother, Anna, at about 10:30a.m. He then allegedly left the crime scene and waited several hours for Yelena, who had been staying at a friend's house, to return home. Once she did, she found Anna dead and called 9-1-1, but Gelman was on his way back to the scene to check if she returned home. Upon arrival at about 4:00p.m., he spotted her outside on the phone <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car, upon which she yelled at him. He hid the knife in his jacket sleeve and approached her, but she took off running. However, Gelman caught up with her and stabbed her eleven times, killing her, before speeding off in Kuznetsov's car. Ramming into another car, Gelman stabbed and wounded the driver, Arthur DiCrescento, three times when he confronted him, before carjacking the vehicle. Gelman later ran down 62-year-old pedestrian Stephen Tanenbaum, who subsequently died of his injuries.|$|E

[...] I heard this cry and looked around, Buffalo Chips was falling over into the hole where the Indians were hiding. [...] Bat was looking into the cave where the Indians were, and about five seconds afterwards jumped out with an Indian’s scalp in his hand, telling me that he had scalped one of the redskins alive, which I found out to be true. [...] He had seen the Indian that killed Buffalo Chips, and he jumped down onto him as the Indian was reaching to get White’s six-shooter. [...] Bat had jumped right down on top of him and scalped him <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cave before anybody knew what he was doing." [...] "Buffalo Chips" [...] White was a boyhood friend of Col. Cody and also a scout. He wanted to be like Buffalo Bill and acquired the sobriquet [...] "Buffalo Chips" [...] when Gen.

60|$|The horse he rode was a {{thoroughly}} good buffalo-runner. It knew the dangerous {{character of the}} bull, if its rider did not, and kept its eye watchfully upon it.
