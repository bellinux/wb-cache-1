These values lie between those of its neighbours actinium (10.1g/cm3) and protactinium (15.4g/cm3), part of a trend across the early actinides.|$|E
5|$|Simulations suggest that, {{while the}} disk had a {{relatively}} high mass at any given moment, over time a substantial fraction (several tenths of <b>a</b> <b>percent)</b> <b>of</b> the mass of Jupiter captured from the Solar nebula was processed through it.

Each generation of moons would have spiraled into Jupiter, due to drag from the disk, with new moons then forming from the new debris captured from the Solar nebula. By the time the present (possibly fifth) generation formed, the disk had thinned out {{to the point that it}} no longer greatly interfered with the moons' orbits. The current Galilean moons were still affected, falling into and being partially protected by an orbital resonance which still exists for Io, Europa, and Ganymede. Ganymede's larger mass means that it would have migrated inward at a faster rate than Europa or Io.|$|E
