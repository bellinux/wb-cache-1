5|$|Berkman {{eventually}} {{broke with}} Most and aligned {{himself with the}} autonomists. The autonomists, an anarchist group associated with Josef Peukert, emphasized individual freedom. They feared the domination of the anarchist movement by a single individual and opposed the establishment of anarchist organizations. Consequently, the autonomists were opposed to Most. Soon, Berkman {{was working for the}} autonomists' publications, Der Anarchist and Die Autonomie, but he remained committed to the concept of violent action <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> for inspiring revolutionary change.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{rejected}} {{the use of}} fiscal policy <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> of demand management; and he held that the government's role in {{the guidance of the}} economy should be restricted severely. Friedman wrote extensively on the Great Depression, which he termed the Great Contraction, arguing that it had been caused by an ordinary financial shock whose duration and seriousness were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the money supply caused by the misguided policies of the directors of the Federal Reserve.|$|E

Through two examples we support the hypothesis that using maintaining dragging <b>as</b> <b>a</b> physical <b>tool</b> may foster cognitive rupture between the conjecturing phase and the proof, while using it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> psychological <b>tool</b> may foster cognitive unity between them...|$|R

40|$|Thirty {{years ago}} Rick Dill {{and his team}} at IBM {{published}} the first account of lithography simulation – the accurate description of semiconductor optical lithography by mathematical equations. Since then, lithography simulation has grown dramatically in importance in four important areas: <b>as</b> <b>a</b> research <b>tool,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> development <b>tool,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> manufacturing <b>tool,</b> and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> learning <b>tool.</b> In this paper, the history of lithography simulations is traced from its roots to today’s indispensable tools for lithographic technology development. Along the way, an attempt {{will be made to}} define the true value of lithography simulation to the semiconductor industry...|$|R
5|$|In November 2015, {{following}} the {{shooting death of}} Jamar Clark at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, Levy-Pounds was involved in a human blockade of Interstate 94. Of the approximately 40 protesters, Levy-Pounds was among the first arrested for the action. MinnPost wrote that she served as a leader in the subsequent protests against Clark's killing. They highlighted Levy-Pounds's savvy in using social media <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> to encourage local and national media to report on the death and demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to reset its {{relationship}} with developers, Twitter acquired Crashlytics on January 28, 2013 for over USD $100 million, its largest acquisition to date.

5|$|Progress {{remained}} slow through 1991 and 1992. A cabinet {{set up in}} October 1991 contained {{almost no}} opposition at all, and the administrative hierarchy across the country only recognised the authority of Habyarimana's MRND party. The regime frequently used violence <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> to hamper reform, justifying its actions as anti-RPF security measures.|$|E
5|$|Russia saw the Black Sea {{coast and}} {{the border with}} Turkey as {{invaluable}} strategic attributes of Georgia. Russia had more vested interests in Abkhazia than in South Ossetia, since the Russian military presence on the Black Sea coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in the Black Sea. Before the early 2000s, South Ossetia was originally intended <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> to retain a grip on Georgia.|$|E

5|$|The late 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries {{were marked by}} the {{establishment}} of tropical botanical gardens <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> of colonial expansion (for trade and commerce and, secondarily, science) mainly by the British and Dutch, in India, South-east Asia and the Caribbean. This was also the time of Sir Joseph Banks's botanical collections during Captain James Cook's circumnavigations of the planet and his explorations of Oceania, which formed the last phase of plant introduction on a grand scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the Nazarov {{cyclization}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> in organic synthesis stems from the utility and ubiquity of cyclopentenones as both motifs in natural products (including jasmone, the aflatoxins, and a subclass of prostaglandins) and as useful synthetic intermediates for total synthesis.

5|$|A {{report in}} 1997 {{described}} use of sponges <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> by bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay in Western Australia. A dolphin will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum, which is presumably {{then used to}} protect it when searching for food in the sandy sea bottom. The behavior, known as sponging, has only been observed in this bay, and is almost exclusively shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behavior to their daughters, and that all the sponge-users are closely related, suggesting {{that it is a}} fairly recent innovation.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1948, the Soviet secret service took an {{interest}} in this area of medicine. One of those with overall responsibility for the Soviet secret police, pre-war Procurator General and State Prosecutor, the deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Vyshinsky, was the first to order the use of psychiatry <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> of repression. Russian psychiatrist Pyotr Gannushkin also believed that in a class society, especially during the most severe class struggle, psychiatry was incapable of not being repressive. A system of political abuse of psychiatry was developed at the end of Joseph Stalin's regime.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} is {{the design}} and manufacture of artificial nucleic acid structures for technological uses. In this field, nucleic acids are used as non-biological engineering materials for nanotechnology rather than as the carriers of genetic information in living cells. Researchers in the field have created static structures such as two- and three-dimensional crystal lattices, nanotubes, polyhedra, and arbitrary shapes, and functional devices such as molecular machines and DNA computers. The field is beginning to be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> to solve basic science problems in structural biology and biophysics, including applications in X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins to determine structures. Potential applications in molecular scale electronics and nanomedicine are also being investigated.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> of war, there still {{was a need}} for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons. The invention of the horse collar in China during the 5th century AD (Southern and Northern Dynasties) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast collars used in earlier times. The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|For some readers, Arthur C. Clarke's more {{straightforward}} novelization of {{the script}} is key to interpreting the film. Clarke's novel explicitly identifies the monolith <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> created by an alien race that has been through many stages of evolution, moving from organic form to biomechanical, and finally achieving a state of pure energy. These aliens travel the cosmos assisting lesser species to take evolutionary steps. Conversely, film critic Penelope Houston wrote in 1971 that because the novel differs in many key respects from the film, it perhaps should not {{be regarded as the}} skeleton key to unlock it.|$|E
