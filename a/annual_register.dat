Derivative versions subsequently appeared in the October 1763 St James Chronicle, the July 1764 Gentleman's Magazine, and the 1764 edition of The <b>Annual</b> <b>Register.</b> The Gentleman's Magazine account in particular was prominent, and contained the oldest known drawing of the figure. In 1774, the antiquarian John Hutchins reviewed various previous accounts in his book The History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset. In it, he wrote that the carving had only been done the previous century.|$|E

The extent to which Burke contributed to the <b>Annual</b> <b>Register</b> is unclear: in his biography of Burke, Robert Murray quotes the Register as evidence of Burke's opinions, yet Philip Magnus in his biography does not cite it directly as a reference.

25|$|In 1820 a {{handwritten}} catalog of 3,168 titles was published {{and is now}} in the library's Rare Book Room. The catalog was organized into two main sections: one an alphabetical section, usually by author, and the other a section of state laws.

25|$|Pratt's first poem, written {{while he}} was still a clergyman, was The Partridges – an elegy. Published in The <b>Annual</b> <b>Register</b> in 1771, it was a 10-verse tale of a mother {{partridge}} praying for the safety of her chicks during the shooting season, and revealed Pratt's concern for animal welfare which would be reflected in later writings. It was included in many collections of popular poetry throughout the 19th Century.|$|E
25|$|Chief Justice John Marshall, {{an ardent}} Federalist from Virginia, greatly admired Washington, and between 1804 and 1807 {{published}} a highly detailed five-volume biography.

Marshall's Life of Washington {{was based on}} records and papers also provided {{to him by the}} Washington family and reflected Marshall's Federalist principles. His revised and condensed two-volume Life of Washington was published in 1832. Historians have often praised its accuracy and well-reasoned judgments, while noting Marshall's frequent paraphrases of published sources such as William Gordon's 1801 history of the Revolution and the British <b>Annual</b> <b>Register.</b>|$|E

500|$|In April 1881, Gladstone {{introduced}} the Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881, {{in which the}} principle of the dual ownership of the land between landlords and tenants was established, and the three Fs introduced.

500|$|Perrins' {{death at}} the age of 50 was {{announced}} on 10 December 1800 in the <b>Annual</b> <b>Register,</b> which noted him as being an [...] "engine-worker". The Register said that [...] However, this announcement of his demise was premature as in fact he died on 6 January 1801 after contracting a fever because of his exertions during the rescue, which had occurred during a huge fire that burned all through the night of 10 December. The fire may be that described in The Annals of Manchester: [...] "warehouses in Hodson Square were burnt down December 10, caused damages to the extent of £50,000, exclusive of the buildings". On 29 December 1800 he had been awarded £20 per annum by the commissioners for [...] "meritorious services".|$|E
500|$|Johnson's general {{criticism}} prompted {{many others}} {{to join in}} the debate. Some reviewers of his Lives of the Poets, and many of Gray's editors, thought that he was too harsh. An article in the <b>Annual</b> <b>Register</b> for 1782 recognised, with relation to the Elegy, [...] "That the doctor was not over zealous to allow [...] the degree of praise that the public voice had universally assigned him, is, we think, sufficiently apparent"; but it went on to qualify this with the opinion that [...] "partiality to [...] beautiful elegy had perhaps allotted him a rank above his general merits." [...] Debate over Gray's work continued into the 19th century, and Victorian critics remained unconvinced by the rest of it. At the end of the century, Matthew Arnold, in his 1881 collection of critical writings, summed up the general response: [...] "The Elegy pleased; it could not but please: but Gray's poetry, on the whole, astonished his contemporaries at first more than it pleased them; it was so unfamiliar, so unlike the sort of poetry in vogue." ...|$|E
