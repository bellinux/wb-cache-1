His exactions were also mentioned in Domesday Book, where an entry in the survey for Gloucestershire noted that his oppression prevented the inhabitants of Sodbury so much that they were unable to pay their customary rents. He intimidated the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter into granting him a lease of two of their estates, Greenhill and Eastbury.

Irving injects {{himself with a}} variant of the Las Plagas {{parasite}} and mutates into a huge octopus-like beast. Redfield and Alomar defeat him, and his dying words lead them to a nearby cave to learn more. The cave is the source of a flower used to create viruses previously used by Umbrella, as well as a new strain named Uroboros. Redfield and Alomar find evidence that Tricell, the company funding the BSAA, took over a former Umbrella Corporation underground laboratory and continued Umbrella's research. In the facility, they discover thousands of capsules holding human test subjects. Although Redfield finds that one of the capsules is Valentine's, it is empty. When they leave, they discover that Tricell CEO Excella Gionne has been plotting with Wesker to launch missiles with the Uroboros virus across the globe; it is eventually revealed that Wesker hopes to take a chosen few from the chaos of infection and rule them, creating <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>breed</b> <b>of</b> humanity.

However, in many cases, physical resource constraints existing between a cache and its data sources require out-of-date data objects be tolerated. Consequently, cache synchronization should try to minimize overall cache divergence within the envelope of available resources. This paper presents a cache refreshment scheme which benefits both the cache and the data sources in terms of resource usage. We approximate the problem of best-effort cache refreshment in single-cache multiplesource environments to an optimization problem in a discrete time space and justify the reasoning. A {{solution to the problem}} is sought and its optimality shown when certain conditions on update patterns are assumed. Cache refreshment using explicit polling is proposed as a practical incarnation of the solution and its effectiveness validated through extensive simulation with realistic parameters. ...|$|R
