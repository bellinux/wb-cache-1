5|$|In 1937, {{work had}} progressed on {{extending}} Berwick Street eastwards, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> extended to Alday Street by November 1938. A new causeway to extend Berwick Street north over the Swan River, {{and make it}} a truck route, was considered by the state government in 1940. The existing Causeway, from which Albany Road commenced, had experienced almost a doubling of traffic volume between 1930 and 1939. However, the new Causeway was eventually constructed adjacent to old Causeway, which was then demolished.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{reports for}} LaGuardia showed {{that on the}} night of the accident, all taxiways were coated with a thin {{covering}} of snow. Runway 13 was also covered with a thin layer of wet snow, although it had been plowed, treated with urea <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> sanded.|$|E
5|$|By 1951, {{the highway}} had been reconstructed {{generally}} along MT 87's present location, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> upgraded to an improved gravel road. In 1959, {{the road in}} the location of MT 87 was rapidly improved in order to serve as an alternate routing to U.S. Route 287. Portions of US 287 around Hebgen Lake collapsed and crumbled {{as a result of the}} 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake. After US 287 was fixed, the highway's importance decreased. In 1962, the portions of the highway from the southern terminus to present-day milepost 8.395 were reconstructed along the current location. In 1967, the rest of the highway was reconstructed along the present location. By 1987, the highway had been numbered as MT 87. The route had also been paved.|$|E

5|$|By February {{the next}} year, {{construction}} had resumed. On 8 April 25men {{working on the}} bridge went on strike. This was of concern due to time dependent concreting being undertaken at that time. As the construction was considered unemployment relief, the constructing authority began to look for men who would do the work in their places. By 13 April, further details had emerged; {{the number of the}} men on strike was actually 32, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> caused by the alleged wrongful dismissal of three men who had left for their lunch break early. The strike continued until at least 21 April. Work had resumed by early May, and the bridge was reported as being a little over half completed at that time.|$|E
5|$|By 1956, {{the surface}} of RM 2134 had been {{upgraded}} to stone, and the northern portion had been additionally straightened. On December 1, 1957, FM 2134 was extended northeastward across the Colorado River to the community of Voss. By 1961, the portion designated as RM 2134 had been upgraded to a bituminous surface, made of asphalt and crushed rock. The other road segment had been upgraded to a metal surface. In addition, a new bridge had been constructed along the RM 2134 portion, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> straightened generally along the present location of RE11. In 1985, plans were approved {{for the construction of}} the Stacey Reservoir. The construction was finished in 1990, and the lake was instead named the O.H. Ivie Reservoir. The construction of the lake destroyed a large portion of RM 2134, and caused the removal of the highway to FM 1929. RE11 was designated on its current location on October 31, 1996, and was officially approved on December 20, 1996. The route remains the most recently designated recreational road.|$|E
5|$|Samuel {{knew that}} the Byzantine army would have to invade the country {{through a series of}} {{mountain}} passes, and so took precautions to bar them. The Bulgarians built ditches along the frontier and fortified many of the valleys and passes with walls and towers, especially the pass of Kleidion on the Struma River which Basil would need to pass through to reach the heart of Bulgaria. Samuel heavily fortified the northern slopes of the Belasitsa mountain to the south and east of Strumitsa Castle. The wide valley of the Strumitsa River was a convenient place for attack <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> used by Byzantine forces for this purpose in previous years. The Bulgarians disposed a strong guard to keep the pass safe. In addition, the Bulgarian ruler chose Strumitsa for his defensive base— it was located on the road from Thessaloniki leading to Thrace to the east and Ohrid to the west. The rugged terrain to the south was dotted with earthworks and walls guarded by strong Bulgarian units.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Graham, the Master of the Mint, in 1859 persuaded William Gladstone, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, {{that the}} state of the copper {{currency}} demanded a lighter, more durable replacement. Bronze was selected as harder and less subject to oxidation. It was a material with which the Mint had experience, having recently struck bronze coins for the Canadian colonies, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> used in France since 1852. Parliament passed legislation in 1860 that allowed the penny to be struck from an alloy of metals. The act required that Britannia appear on the coin, as the design was felt to symbolise Britain as ruler of the waves, and to omit her would be seen as abandoning that role. The Mint in 1860 awarded a contract for 1,720 tonnes of bronze pennies, halfpennies and farthings to James Watt & Co of Birmingham, a contract that would not be completed until 1863. Heaton's was also called upon to supply dies and coins, especially as Watt's prepared to execute its huge contract.|$|E

25|$|The {{constellation}} {{was renamed}} Vespa by Jakob Bartsch in 1624. The renaming by Bartsch {{may have been}} intended to avoid confusion with another constellation, created by Plancius in 1598, that was called Apis by Bayer in 1603. Plancius called this earlier constellation Muia (Greek for fly) in 1612, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> called Musca (Latin for fly) by Blaeu in 1602, although Bayer was evidently unaware of this.|$|E
25|$|After D-Day, General Groves {{ordered a}} team of {{scientists}} to follow eastward-moving victorious Allied troops into Europe to assess the status of the German nuclear program (and to prevent the westward-moving Soviets from gaining any materials or scientific manpower).

Ironically, Allwright had been the chair of the 1879 electoral commission, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> his casting vote that unseated Grey and thus allowed Richardson back into the lower house.|$|E
