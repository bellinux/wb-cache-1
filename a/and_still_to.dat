2500|$|Henry Cowell's music {{covers a}} wider range in both {{expression}} and technique than {{that of any other}} living composer.

No other composer of our time has produced a body of works so radical and so normal, so penetrating and so comprehensive. Add to this massive production his long and influential career as a pedagogue, and Henry Cowell's achievement becomes impressive indeed. There is no other quite like it. To be both fecund and right is given to few.|$|E
