Pierce {{spent the first}} few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was <b>a</b> <b>chore,</b> as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.|$|E

5|$|Kirill {{arrives at}} the {{workshop}} of Theophanes the Greek (Nikolai Sergeyev), a prominent and well-recognized master painter, {{who is working on}} a new icon of Jesus Christ. Theophanes is portrayed as a complex character: an established artist, humanistic and God-fearing in his views yet somewhat cynical, regarding his art more as a craft and <b>a</b> <b>chore</b> in his disillusion with other people. His young apprentices have all run away to the town square, where a wrongly convicted criminal is about to be tortured and executed. Kirill talks to Theophanes, and the artist, impressed by the monk's understanding and erudition, invites him to work as his apprentice on the decoration of the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow. Kirill refuses at first, but then accepts the offer on the condition that Theophanes will personally come to the Andronikov Monastery and invite Kirill to work with him in front of all the fraternity and Andrei Rublev, who according to Theophanes' comments has some fame as an icon painter in the outside world.|$|E

25|$|In some Native Hawaiian communities, {{there is}} a {{constant}} use of “talk story” which plays an essential role in promoting solidarity in the community by not overpowering or making the members of the community feel inadequate for not understanding something. Talk story can consist of recalled events, folktales, and joking. Joking can be used to tease and guide the children about how to do <b>a</b> <b>chore</b> better or to avoid serious trouble. Talk story relates to an Indigenous way of learning by providing conversations such as narratives and dramatizations with verbal and nonverbal communication between the elder and children.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} {{of how a}} woman perceives her behavior should not be underestimated. Many women perceived sex as <b>a</b> <b>chore</b> {{as opposed to a}} pleasurable experience, and they tend to consider themselves sexually inadequate, which in turn does not motivate them to engage in sexual activity. Several factors influence a women's perception of her sexual life. These can include: race, her gender, ethnicity, educational background, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, financial resources, culture, and religion. Cultural differences are also present in how women view menopause and its impact on health, self-image, and sexuality. A study has found that African American women are the most optimistic about menopausal life; Caucasian women are the most anxious, Asian women are the most inhibited about their symptoms, and Hispanic women are the most stoic.|$|E

25|$|The {{hallmarks}} of Cutler's work are surreal, bizarre juxtapositions and {{close attention to}} small details of existence, all described in seemingly naive language. In performance his delivery was frail, halting and minimally inflected. His writing sometimes edged into whimsy or the macabre. Many of his poems and songs are {{in the form of}} conversations delivered as a monologue. In these, one party is often Cutler as a child, a poetic voice which he adopted in order to bypass the intellect. Cutler describes the poverty of his early life and the neglect he experienced from his parents with great stoicism. He expresses acceptance of his lot and gratitude for the basic elements of life, for nature, and for parental love, even though that love might bear the marks of strain. In these works the humour arises from the child's curiosity and the playful or self-serving lies the parent tells him in instructing him to do <b>a</b> <b>chore</b> or in order to stop the incessant questions.|$|E

500|$|The fourth game {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Destructoid criticized the fourth game for its excessively-loud jumpscares and the breathing mechanic being too difficult and confusing for players. Despite this, it was praised by one reviewer at GameZebo for its intense environment and creepy sounds and graphics, {{as well as}} its jumpscares. It was also given a mixed review by PC Gamer, who called it [...] "another rivet in the series' steel-clad design which immortalized its Let's Play legacy in a few short months" [...] and [...] "certainly the scariest of the four [...] ", but also criticized the gameplay, saying that [...] "the humdrum repetition of the same sequence over and over... is too much of <b>a</b> <b>chore</b> to fully pull me in", as well as criticizing the game's lack of the series's signature camera system.|$|E

500|$|Reception towards Spartan Ops {{was less}} {{favorable}} than multiplayer and campaign; some reviewers expressed their disappointment in Spartan Ops replacing the cooperative Firefight mode. Criticisms {{were aimed at}} the brevity of missions and lack of replay value. Despite any shortcomings, IGN said the mode was a must-play for the [...] "incredible pre-episode cinematics" [...] which open up [...] "a number of interesting narrative possibilities for future episodes and seasons." [...] Martin Robinson of Eurogamer complained about the repetition of environments within {{the first half of}} the season and noted that missions quickly become <b>a</b> <b>chore.</b> [...] He felt that Spartan Ops was a [...] "weak, bloated alternative" [...] compared to Firefight. [...] 1UP.com found that while the short length felt odd initially, the mode was still fun to play and offered more opportunities to play Halo cooperatively.|$|E
500|$|Computer Gaming Worlds {{reviewer}} Roy Wagner ("a wholesome family man") {{stated that}} Larry [...] "is {{a lot of}} fun to play and is very humorous ... with good graphics, good design, and good fun provided, who needs 'good taste'?" [...] According to the review by Rob Steele of The Games Machine, the Atari ST version was entertaining and very enjoyable, even if [...] "wholeheartedly sexist". Jason Simmons from Amiga Action opined that the 1991 remake's [...] "advanced graphics and new control system have improved the game by a huge degree", but [...] "without a hard drive it is slow and almost <b>a</b> <b>chore</b> to play" [...] and those who played the original [...] "will probably find the new edition a waste of time and little more than an exercise in pretty pictures." [...] In 2004, Adventure Gamers' Rob Michaud wrote: [...] "Despite its weaknesses, it's a bona fide gaming classic, a must-play for adventure history buffs as well as those who just like risqué humor." ...|$|E
500|$|Combat {{was also}} criticized; Computer Games called the game [...] "little {{more than a}} hack-and-slash adventure", and said the game's focus on combat was counter to the greater focus on {{political}} intrigue and social interaction prevalent in the source Vampire – the Masquerade tabletop game. ArsTechnica said that combat was initially fun but very repetitive, and it became <b>a</b> <b>chore</b> by the later stages of the game, noting that every enemy dungeon consisted of four levels filled with identical enemies, while Next Generation said the number of enemies {{and the difficulty of}} defeating them often meant the playable character would run away or die. The repetitive combat was also criticized by other reviewers, who disliked that it involved repeatedly clicking on enemies until they were dead; and running away if the playable character was about to die against unending waves of enemies. Disciplines were considered helpful in adding variety to combat, but battles were too fast-paced to allow the tactical use {{of a wide range of}} powers because of the inability to pause the combat to allow the issuing of orders.|$|E

500|$|The {{reaction}} was not uniformly positive. On seeing the film, François Truffaut {{is reported to}} have said, [...] "I don't want to see a movie of peasants eating with their hands." [...] Bosley Crowther, the most influential critic of The New York Times, wrote in 1958, [...] "Any picture as loose in structure or as listless in tempo as this one is would barely pass as a 'rough cut' with the editors in Hollywood", even though he praised its gradually emerging poignancy and poetic quality. The Harvard Crimson argued in 1959 that its fragmentary nature [...] "contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of <b>a</b> <b>chore</b> to sit through." [...] Early in the 1980s, Ray was criticised by Nargis Dutt, parliamentarian and former actress, for [...] "exporting poverty". Darius Cooper writes that while many critics celebrated the Apu trilogy [...] "as a eulogy of third-world culture, others criticized it for what they took to be its romanticization of such a culture".|$|E
500|$|Metroid Prime: Trilogy {{has also}} been subject to criticism. GamePros Ashley Schoeller said that graphically, [...] "the games do look a bit dated" [...] and complained that the HUD was [...] "out of aspect" [...] to fit the widescreen. Official Nintendo Magazines Fred Dutton said that some aspects of Prime and Echoes had aged, saying the {{backtracking}} [...] "feels like more of <b>a</b> <b>chore</b> than it did seven years ago," [...] {{and that it is}} [...] "not until [...] enters its final third that things really start to pick up". GamesRadar considered the achievements too expensive, and that the similarity between the three games gives [...] "an inescapable sense of déjà vu". Edge noted that the control scheme was not very innovative, and that Echoes and Corruption [...] "favoured graphical flourishes over design innovation". While Ben Reeves of Game Informer praised the game, the [...] "second opinion" [...] reviewer, Adam Biessener, considered the collection [...] "subpar", saying it lacked innovation, and that the Wii control scheme, particularly aiming and panning, [...] "is inferior in every way to the traditional scheme from the GameCube titles".|$|E
500|$|Mark Bozon of IGN {{was highly}} {{critical}} of the game's dated graphics, found the overall gameplay very slow, and found the garbled voice work unsettling while enjoying the soundtrack. He concluded that, even as a fan of old school and abstract gameplay design, he had not enjoyed his time with the game. Lark Anderson, writing for GameSpot said there was [...] "never a dull moment" [...] due to the eccentric cast and story, and found the puzzle elements to be an entertaining challenge. His main complaints were the poor graphics, unresponsive camera system, lack of direction during navigation and the constant need for backtracking. Nintendo World Report's Nick DiMola noted the dialogue for its humor, but generally faulted most other aspects of the game; he called its graphics and sound low-quality, felt the gameplay was shallow, and found the puzzle solving segments <b>a</b> <b>chore.</b> He found it hard to recommend the title for any but dedicated fans of Suda's work. PALGN reviewer Ben Chev called the script [...] "well-written in what {{can only be described as}} a typical Suda 51 style", and praised the music for its unique take on classical music. However he generally faulted the gameplay and called the graphics the worst he had seen for the DS.|$|E
