40|$|Background/Aims: The {{mechanism}} underlying extracellular adenosine-induced caspase-independent apoptosis in HuH- 7 human hepatoma {{cells is}} not fully understood. The present study investigated the role for apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) -homologous mitochondrion-associated inducer of death (<b>AMID)</b> in <b>the</b> pathway. Methods: To see <b>the</b> implication of <b>AMID</b> in adenosine-induced HuH- 7 cell apoptosis, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunofluorescent cytochemistry, time-laps GFP monitoring, cell cycle analysis, flow cytometry, Western blotting, cell viability assay, and TUNEL staining were carried out. Results: Adenosine upregulated AMID expression in HuH- 7 cells, and translocated <b>AMID</b> from <b>the</b> cytosol into the nucleus. Adenosine induced HuH- 7 cell apoptosis, and the effect was further enhanced by overexpressing AMID. Adenosine-induced HuH- 7 cell apoptosis, alternatively, was inhibited by knocking-down <b>AMID.</b> Conclusion: <b>The</b> {{results of the present}} study provide evidence for AMID as a critical factor for adenosine-induced caspase-independent HuH- 7 cell apoptosis...|$|R
