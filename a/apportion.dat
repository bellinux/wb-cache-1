5|$|A {{compulsory}} {{and free}} {{primary and secondary}} public education for every Virginia child {{is the focus of}} Article VIII. The General Assembly is empowered to determine the funding for the educational system and <b>apportion</b> the cost between state and local government. A state Board of Education is established to create school divisions and effectuate the overall educational policies. Supervision of the individual schools is delegated to local school boards, provided for in ยง7.|$|E
5|$|When Sivanandam and Naidu {{interrogate}} Pattabi, {{who feels}} remorse for Rajan's death, {{he admits that}} he did not treat his brother well nor understand his good intentions. He recounts an incident in which his wife Hema fought with Rajan because he refused to <b>apportion</b> the property. Pattabi states that Hema could have killed Rajan for the money as she loses her sanity when overpowered by anger.|$|E

50|$|The US has rules {{requiring}} that certain deductions be <b>apportioned</b> among all income on a formulary basis. These rules are quite complex. Interest expense must be <b>apportioned</b> based on relative adjusted tax basis of assets that produce or could produce the {{particular type of}} income. Research and experimentation expenses must be <b>apportioned</b> based on either relative sales or relative gross income. Taxpayers must elect which base to use, and such election applies for five years. State income taxes must be <b>apportioned</b> based on complex formulae. Stewardship and supportive expenses must each be allocated and <b>apportioned</b> under one of several methods. Note that few other countries have developed rules to this level of complexity and specificity.|$|R

In the Alaska and Hawaii markets, U-Haul registers equipment locally because those states do not have <b>apportioned</b> vehicle registration systems.|$|R
5|$|After {{almost six}} months of wrangling, the {{question}} of apportionment was brought up for a vote. The compromise was to <b>apportion</b> the House of Delegates on the white population basis, giving the western counties a majority, but for the Senate to be apportioned on a modified mixed basis of population and property including slaves, giving the eastern counties a majority. In the remaining two months of the Convention, it was agreed to allow direct popular election of the governor, but each office holder {{would be limited to}} one term. Constitutional provision for public education was voted down. Voting by secret ballot was rejected, perpetuating viva voce voting.|$|E
5|$|During Brown's {{tenure in}} the New York State Senate his Democratic Party {{was in the}} minority. He {{was part of the}} {{majority}} that backed New York Governor George Pataki's 2001 plan to build up to three Western New York casinos on Seneca Indian land. The legislation was controversial because it granted slot machine rights to casino operators {{for the first time in}} New York State. Both of the previous casinos used video gambling machines with debit cards. Brown supported the casinos as a way to support the local economy. When the casino was completed in 2003, he was on the seven-member commission that was to <b>apportion</b> the state's agreed 18% share of the slot machine revenue, amounting to approximately $40million.|$|E
5|$|The 503rd Parachute Infantry {{lost three}} men killed and 33 {{injured in the}} jump. Another eight were killed and 12 wounded in action against the Japanese, and 26 were {{evacuated}} sick. The 2/5th Field Ambulance treated 55 jump casualties on 7 September. Between 5 and 19 September, the 7th Division reported 38 killed and 104 wounded, while another 138 were evacuated sick. To this must be added the 11 Americans and 59 Australians killed and 92 Australians injured in the air crash at Jackson's Airfield. Thus, 119 Allied servicemen were killed, 241 wounded or injured, and 166 evacuated sick. Japanese casualties were estimated at 2,200, but {{it is impossible to}} <b>apportion</b> them between the 7th and 9th Divisions.|$|E
50|$|Instead, {{most state}} legislatures imitated the Congress, {{in which the}} lower house is <b>apportioned</b> by population, while the upper house is <b>apportioned</b> by some other criterion. For example, each county might have one state senator.|$|R
30|$|An {{example is}} used to {{illustrate}} the concept. Typical systems analyzed are new developments within landslide prone areas or existing/proposed alignments of highways. Risk criteria can then be defined for the system (either the new development or the highway). The risk value to be evaluated against the selected criterion is {{the integration of the}} risks associated with all hazards and sectors within the system (all slopes, all potential failure volumes, every mile along the highway, and considerations of all other ground hazards). In practice, however, it is unlikely that all hazards and sectors be considered due to time constrains, budget limitations, or scenarios deemed negligible. To account for the different sectors (i.e. mileage along the highway), the criterion needs to be <b>apportioned.</b> If the <b>apportioning</b> is based only on the linear or aerial extent of the system, (same risk thresholds for each mile along the highway or for each slope within the proposed development), it is an even <b>apportioning</b> or distribution. It is often the case, however, that a number of sectors will be more hazardous than others. In cases where the analyst is aware of this variability in hazard levels, an even <b>apportioning</b> could lead to criterion that is too strict at some locations and not a reflection of the defined overall criterion and perception of risk. <b>Apportioning</b> the criterion with considerations of the relative hazard levels or the exposure of the population would be a weighted <b>apportioning</b> or distribution. The criteria for defining the weights for <b>apportioning</b> will reflect the perceived variation in hazard levels through the entire system and for all potential hazards in light of the available knowledge and information. Weighted or even <b>apportioning</b> should reflect the existing understanding of the situation and the adequacy of <b>apportioning</b> criteria based on even distribution of risk or weighted distributions needs to be assessed for each particular case. <b>Apportioning</b> criteria should be reviewed and periodically updated together with the risk estimations and in light of risk analyses of hazards not previously assessed.|$|R
50|$|Citizens of the nation's capital, Washington, D.C., {{have not}} been <b>apportioned</b> a {{representative}} or US senator in Congress. This is because D.C. is a federal district and not a state and under the Constitution, only states are <b>apportioned</b> congresspersons.|$|R
5|$|The Inclosure Act {{separated}} Gateshead Fell into Wrekenton and Sheriff Hill (collectively High Fell) plus Low Fell. Commissioners {{were appointed}} to settle claims in land and to <b>apportion</b> Gateshead Fell accordingly. Plans were laid for the requisition {{and construction of}} wells (including Carter's Well; located on Durham Road and accompanied today by a commemorative Gateshead blue plaque), quarries, drains, roads, watering places and other essential requirements. Progress was slow, with the last allotment disputes not settled until 1822, {{but by the time}} of completion, Gateshead Fell was entirely enclosed and effectively consigned to history. The divisions of Gateshead Fell have remained more or less settled, so that the villages created by enclosure have survived, almost entirely intact, to the present day.|$|E
5|$|Named to the {{advisory}} group chosen {{to support the}} review board, Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, {{it soon became clear}} that an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire, probably sparked by a chafed wire. What was less clear was where to <b>apportion</b> responsibility. NASA engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space, in which almost any materialincluding Velcro, with which the cabin was filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by the feeling that he, personally, was responsible for the deaths of three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home.|$|E
5|$|The 1845 {{legislature}} met {{three different}} times, under two different structures. First, from June 24 to July 5, 1845, the legislature met in Oregon City, {{first at the}} home of John E. Long and then the home of Theophilus R. Magruder, with Morton M. McCarver serving as the speaker of the group. After this, the Organic Laws were replaced with the Organic Act of 1845, which altered the legislature in several ways. First the number of representatives was increased to include a minimum of 13 and a maximum of 61. Second, the name was changed to the House of Representatives. All members of the body were to be elected by popular vote with vacancies filled using special elections. The body also received new powers to impeach any civil official by a 3/4ths vote, <b>apportion</b> the legislators among the districts, create post offices, levy taxes, declare war, organize and call out the militia, create lower courts, pass laws concerning the general welfare of the region, regulate trade with the Native Americans, regulate liquor sale and manufacture, and regulate the police power of the government, among other powers. Meetings continued to be in June and December.|$|E

5000|$|In 1838, Fulton County {{was split}} from Montgomery County.

50|$|In 1798, Chenango County {{was created}} from parts of Herkimer and Tioga counties, and was <b>apportioned</b> two {{seats in the}} Assembly, one each taken from Herkimer and Tioga. Oneida County was created from Herkimer, and was <b>apportioned</b> three seats in the Assembly, taken from Herkimer. Rockland County was created from Orange County, and was <b>apportioned</b> one seat in the Assembly, taken from Orange. Besides, two seats from Ulster Co. and one seat from Albany Co. were {{transferred}} to Orange Co.|$|R
25|$|Following {{the straw}} poll, delegates are then elected from the {{remaining}} {{participants in the}} room, as most voters leave once their vote is cast. All delegates are officially considered unbound, but media outlets either <b>apportion</b> delegates proportionally or <b>apportion</b> {{them in terms of}} winner-take-all by counties. In precincts that elect only one delegate, the delegate is chosen by majority vote and the vote must be by paper ballot. The state party strongly urges that delegates reflect the results of the preference poll, but there is no obligation that they do so.|$|E
25|$|When {{transport}} operations were franchised, revalidation data {{was also used}} to <b>apportion</b> revenue share between operators. This has since been abandoned in favour of fixed percentage allocations (40% train, 40% tram and 20% bus).|$|E
25|$|Audi's 'trademark' quattro {{permanent}} (or semi-permanent, {{dependent on}} gearbox type) four-wheel drive system {{was the only}} offering for the drivetrain. This normally distributes the engine torque as a 'default' 50:50 between front and rear axles, but can automatically dynamically <b>apportion</b> up to a bias of 20:80 to 80:20 front and rear. The automatic transmission utilizes a hydraulically controlled multi-plate clutch to <b>apportion</b> drive between front and rear axles, whereas the manual transmission variants utilize a Torsen type 1 Torque Sensing center differential. The rear axle final drive unit contains a Torsen type 1 Torque Sensing differential, instead of the more common hypoid open differential.|$|E

5|$|The first area {{of major}} dispute was the manner {{by which the}} lower house would be <b>apportioned.</b> A {{minority}} {{wanted it to be}} <b>apportioned</b> so that all states would have equal weight, though this was never seriously considered. Most wanted it <b>apportioned</b> in accordance with some mixture of property and population. Though there was discussion on how to calculate property for this purpose, the issue of property was later dropped because of its difficulty, and an assumption that property would closely correlate to population.|$|R
50|$|Upon statehood, Texas was <b>apportioned</b> two seats.|$|R
25|$|The {{basis for}} {{legislative}} representation is population, {{as determined by}} the US Census; however the General Assembly can always use other, non-population factors to <b>apportion</b> one house (the Senate) unless the US Constitution is currently authoritatively interpreted to forbid that, as it currently is under Reynolds v. Sims (Section 4).|$|E
25|$|Indeed, {{that had}} been the {{understanding}} with respect to all income taxes until the Pollock decision. The Sixteenth Amendment removed the need imposed by the Pollock decision to determine whether an income tax in any particular case was required to be apportioned, as the Congress could again (after 1913) tax income from any source without having to <b>apportion</b> the tax according to population.|$|E
25|$|An {{epicyclic}} differential can use {{epicyclic gearing}} to split and <b>apportion</b> torque asymmetrically between {{the front and}} rear axles. An epicyclic differential {{is at the heart of}} the Toyota Prius automotive drive train, where it interconnects the engine, motor-generators, and the drive wheels (which have a second differential for splitting torque as usual). It has the advantage of being relatively compact along the length of its axis (that is, the sun gear shaft).|$|E
5000|$|After Pollock, while {{income taxes}} on wages (as {{indirect}} taxes) were still {{not required to}} be <b>apportioned</b> by population, taxes on interest, dividends, and rental income were required to be <b>apportioned</b> by population. The Pollock ruling made {{the source of the}} income (e.g., property versus labor, etc.) relevant in determining whether the tax imposed on that income was deemed to be [...] "direct" [...] (and thus required to be <b>apportioned</b> among the states according to population) or, alternatively, [...] "indirect" [...] (and thus required only to be imposed with geographical uniformity).|$|R

25|$|The {{liability}} of West Virginia is a deepseated equity, not discharged {{by changes in}} the form of the debt, nor split up by the unilateral attempt of Virginia to <b>apportion</b> specific parts to the two states. If one-third of the debt were discharged in fact to all intents, we perceive no reason in what has happened why West Virginia should not contribute her proportion of the remaining two-thirds. But we are of opinion that no part of the debt is extinguished, and further, that nothing has happened to bring the rule of New Hampshire v. Louisiana into play.|$|E
25|$|The system {{gradually}} {{ended with}} the Tithe Commutation Act 1836, whose long-lasting Tithe Commission replaced them with a commutation payment, land award and/or rentcharges to those paying the commutation payment and {{took the opportunity to}} map out (<b>apportion)</b> residual chancel liability where the rectory had been appropriated during the medieval period by a religious house or college. Its records give a snapshot of land ownership in most parishes, the Tithe Files, are a socio-economic history resource. The rolled-up payment of several years' tithe would be divided between the tithe-owners as at the date of their extinction.|$|E
25|$|In May 1991 Lee spearheaded a {{drive to}} {{eliminate}} the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion, laws put in place following the KMT arrival in 1949 that suspended the democratic functions of the government.
