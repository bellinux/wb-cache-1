5|$|In March 2017, to {{coincide}} with International Women's Day and Women's History Month, the Tory Burch Foundation launched Embrace Ambition, a global campaign to address the double standard that exists around ambition, which is often seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> trait in men and a negative one in women. The campaign includes a video PSA featuring a variety of celebrities, both women and men. In September 2017, Burch wrote an opinion piece in TIME on pay equity for women, noting how equal pay benefits society and business across the board.|$|E

Thawing relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States in the 1970s opened a new chapter for the mission. For the first time, the mission and its participants {{became the subject of}} serious scholarship, and many of the mission participants were among the first Americans invited to visit China in twenty years. In China, the Dixie Mission is remembered <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> time between the two nations, and a symbol of Sino-American cooperation.|$|E
5|$|The American Dream, or the {{perception}} that Americans enjoy high social mobility, {{plays a key role}} in attracting immigrants. Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate. While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society, scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values. Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree. While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> attribute.|$|E
5|$|The Dixie Mission {{hosted the}} Patrick Hurley and George Marshall {{diplomatic}} missions {{to negotiate a}} unification of the Chinese Communists and Nationalists.

Nixon when official {{relations between the two}} countries were re-established. Veterans of the Dixie Mission, like John Service and Koji Ariyoshi, were among the first Americans invited to visit the People's Republic of China.|$|E

5|$|The Ninth Five-Year Plan {{delivered}} a change: {{for the first}} time industrial consumer products out-produced industrial capital goods. Consumer goods such as watches, furniture and radios were produced in abundance. The plan still left the bulk of the state's investment in industrial capital-goods production. This outcome was not seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> sign {{for the future of the}} Soviet state by the majority of top party functionaries within the government; by 1975 consumer goods were expanding 9% slower than industrial capital-goods. The policy continued despite Brezhnev's commitment to make a rapid shift of investment to satisfy Soviet consumers and lead to an even higher standard of living. This did not happen.|$|E
5|$|The account went viral in 2011 {{and led to}} the reinvigoration of Molyneux's legacy. To many, the two became entwined. Molyneux's {{reputation}} as a dreamer was reclaimed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> trait in light of growing opposition to conservative game design, and the parody account became a mouthpiece for that population. The tweets contributed to Molyneux's decision to leave Microsoft Game Studios and pursue riskier game ideas. They also inspired a game jam, in which about 1,000 game developers worldwide created about 300 games based on the tweets {{over the course of a}} weekend. The game jam also brought Molyneux fame within a burgeoning indie game movement. Notable games based on the parody account's ideas include Donut County.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea came}} to him after {{attending}} the first Jubilee {{in the city of}} Rome, in 1300, where he realized that Rome's many historical achievements were well-known, and he desired to lay out a history of the origins of his own city of Florence. In his Cronica, Villani described in detail the many building projects of the city, statistical information on population, ordinances, commerce and trade, education, and religious facilities. He also described several disasters such as famines, floods, fires, and the pandemic of the Black Death in 1348, which would take his own life. Villani's work on the Cronica was continued by his brother and nephew after his death. It has been described as the first introduction of statistics <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> element in history.|$|E

5|$|Although Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, who is {{also the}} country's Defence Minister, denied the {{existence}} of problems between the participating countries, academics said that because of regional conflicts, there were genuine trust issues involved in co-operation and sharing intelligence, and that these were hampering the search. International relations experts said entrenched rivalries over sovereignty, security, intelligence, and national interests made meaningful multilateral co-operation very difficult. A Chinese academic made the observation that the parties were searching independently; thus it was not a multilateral search effort. The Guardian noted the Vietnamese permission given for Chinese aircraft to overfly its airspace <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> sign of co-operation. Vietnam temporarily scaled back its search operations after the country's Deputy Transport Minister cited a lack of communication from Malaysian officials despite requests for more information. China, through the official Xinhua News Agency, said that the Malaysian government ought to take charge and conduct the operation with greater transparency, a point echoed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry days later.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} games, the visuals of End of Ages were widely praised. The switch to real-time rendering was generally seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> step. The game's music was lauded; GameSpot's review noted {{the use of}} music in End of Ages was sparse, but the little audio present set the proper tone for different Ages. A few reviewers, such as Charles Herold of the New York Times, felt that the graphics fell short of what was possible, especially compared to the prerendered visuals of Myst IV: Revelation. While Greg Kasavin of GameSpot felt that though the visuals were on par {{with previous}} games, End of Ages was missing several elements which made Myst IV more immersive; only important, story-driving items could be interacted with, for example, and the player makes no sounds or footsteps in the game.|$|E
5|$|International {{recognition}} {{of the new government}} did not prove to be difficult. The Western powers were not pleased with the Third Seimas when it ratified the non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in September. They were looking for a government that would change the priorities of Lithuanian foreign policy. It was therefore not surprising that the British Daily Telegraph, the French Le Matin, and the United States' New York Times wrote that the coup was expected to curtail the move towards friendly relations with the Soviet Union and normalize relations with Poland; the anti-democratic and unconstitutional nature of the coup was not emphasized. The Western press reported the news calmly, or assessed it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> development in the Lithuanian struggle against Bolshevism. International diplomatic opinion held that a strong authoritarian leader would provide internal stability, and that even during the earlier years of the republic Lithuania had not been genuinely democratic, since many essential freedoms were curtailed under martial law.|$|E

The first train of the restored service left Cardiff Central for Ebbw Vale Parkway at 06:35 on Wednesday 6 February 2008. The first train to run in the opposite direction left five minutes later, packed with dignitaries for the official opening. Deputy First Minister Ieuan Wyn Jones opened the line along with Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council's former Labour leader Hedley McCarthy.

5|$|The {{relationship}} between sections 3 and 4 and parliamentary sovereignty has been commented on most extensively. The most common criticism {{has been of}} the implied limitations on legislative supremacy. Opponents of this criticism has questioned both its factual accuracy and its suggestion that the weakening of parliamentary sovereignty should be avoided. They instead cite morality and constitutionalism as among positive features of this change. The limits of courts' powers have also been queried. The retroactivity of law making is one criticism related {{to the rule of}} law, although the advancement of human rights is seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> feature also associated with the rule of law. Whilst the scope of section 3 has been criticised for being vague and there have been warnings of to the imposition of the judiciary on parliament's domain, these have also been challenged.|$|E
5|$|While not {{uncommon}} in predominantly Catholic cultures, Christian metal is rooted in evangelical Protestantism, beginning {{as a means of}} evangelism among the non-Christian metal scene. Over the years the focus changed because of the increased secularization of Christianity in the West during the 1990s. Moberg (2008) notes that the current scene seems to have very little interest in evangelism, especially in Northern Europe. Instead, it is argued that the current Christian metal music scene ultimately provides its core members with important resources for the shaping of an alternative and complementary form of religious expression and practice and an alternative Christian identity. Thus, Moberg states that Christian metal serves four main purposes: an alternative form of religious expression and identity; as a legitimate form of religious expression; as an effective means of evangelism and fighting and standing up for the Christian faith; <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> alternative to non-Christian metal.|$|E

5|$|Benavidez Elementary School, {{which opened}} on Tuesday January 21, 1992, {{relieved}} Cunningham of around 675 students and 29 teachers. Benavidez, {{along with two}} other schools, {{was a part of}} a $370 million Houston ISD school construction project, which originated from a school bond approved in March 1989. Rose Garza, the principal of Benavidez, said that the committee determining the name of the school named it after Roy P. Benavidez, a soldier in the Vietnam War who was given the Medal of Honor, because the school wanted to name the school after a Hispanic who could serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> role model to the mostly Hispanic student body that occupied the school when it opened. HISD officials said that the district had little difficulty opening the three schools {{in the middle of the}} year, since the same teachers had been teaching the same students while they occupied the previously overcrowded schools in the preceding fall. On its opening day Benavidez referred 400 students to other schools due to overcrowding. After Benavidez opened, Benavidez and Cunningham each had about 700 students. In 1994, Benavidez had 1,065 pupils and it had to send 200 children to different schools. As of that year, 88% of Benavidez's children were Hispanic. By 1996, both Cunningham and Benavidez became overcrowded. Gordon also became a reliever school for Benavidez and another non-Gulfton school. SER-Niños opened in 1996. In 2000 Benavidez had 1,300 students and Cunningham had 1,190 students. At the schools, the average classroom size was 30 students, exceeding the state's recommendation of 22 students per classroom.|$|E
