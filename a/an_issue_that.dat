5|$|Ellen {{became a}} tourist {{attraction}} for the village, and her family made considerable money from visitors' donations.

In late 1880, soon after her mother's death, Ellen awoke. She later married and had at least five children.|$|E

5|$|Cornwall, {{represented}} by the Cornwall Commonwealth Games Association (CCGA), sent a bid {{for participation in the}} 2006 Commonwealth Games, however, their application was rejected by the CGF, who stated that the constitutional status of Cornwall was not <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> should be resolved through this medium. However, in 2010, the CCGA sought to launch a legal challenge to the decision of the CGF, stating that the Cornish bid of 2006 fulfilled the entire criterion of the CGF, and by rejecting the bid, the CGF had violated their own code, failing to follow their own criteria for participation. The Cornwall team will therefore seek competition in the 2014 games.|$|E
5|$|Glenn {{chaired the}} Committee on Governmental Affairs from 1987 to 1995.

Glenn was {{made aware of the}} problem at the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center near Cincinnati, and soon found that it was <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> occurred at several sites around the nation. Glenn requested investigations from the General Accounting Office of Congress and held several hearings on the issue. He spent the remainder of his Senate career acquiring funding to clean up the nuclear waste left at the facilities.

5|$|Quarrying in Giffnock {{continued}} until 1912 when, due to flooding {{and the high}} cost of extracting stone, work ceased. Numerous ventures tried to revitalise the quarries for other purposes, including the cultivation of mushrooms in the tunnels. As the pits began to fill with water, it became <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> needed to be resolved. In the early 1930s, William Bearmore & Co began tipping slag from the production of steel into the Giffnock quarries. The slag tipping {{continued until}} 1969, when Derek Crouch Limited began scrap metal extraction, which lasted until the late 1970s. Today the ground is a wasteland.|$|E
5|$|String bikinis {{and other}} {{revealing}} clothes {{are common in}} surfing, though most surfing bikinis are more robust with more coverage than sunning bikinis. Surfing Magazine printed a pictorial of Kymberly Herrin, Playboy Playmate March 1981, surfing in a revealing bikini, and eventually started an annual bikini issue. The Association of Surfing Professionals often pairs female surf meets with bikini contests, <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> divides the female pro-surfing community into two parts. It has often been more profitable to win the bikini contest than the female surfing event.|$|E
5|$|The 1874 House {{elections}} {{produced a}} Democratic majority for the 44th Congress, and Blaineâ€™s time as Speaker {{was at an}} end. This gave Blaine more time to concentrate on his presidential ambitions, and to develop new policy ideas. One result was a foray into education policy. In late 1875, President Grant made several speeches {{on the importance of}} {{the separation of church and}} state and the duty of the states to provide free public education. Blaine saw in this <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> would distract from the Grant administration scandals and let the Republican party regain the high moral ground. In December 1875, he proposed a joint resolution that became known as the Blaine Amendment.|$|E

5|$|The Bassett {{years of}} the late-50s to early-70s were marked by mediocrity on the field but {{consistent}} success at the turnstiles. <b>An</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> has become a perennial concern in the city also emerged at this time: {{the possibility of a}} National Football League team in Toronto. Various machinations were entertained by Bassett including moving the Argos to the NFL, bringing an American expansion team to the city (e.g. the Toronto Northmen of the WFL), or expanding the CFL itself in the opposite direction. Other team owners steadfastly opposed Bassett's moves and almost rescinded his franchise in 1974; angered, he sold the team for $3.3 million to hotel magnate William R. Hodgson in the same year.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsidiarity}} principle resolves some {{of these}} issues. The term originates from social thought within the Catholic Church and states that no larger organ shall resolve <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> can be resolved at a more local level. It {{can be compared to}} federalist principles where entities of the union retain some aspects of sovereignty. Only when two or more members of the federation are affected by any given act does the federal government have the authority to intervene. Giving a reformed UN more powers but enshrining the subsidiarity principle in its Charter would guarantee that the UN does not evolve into a world autocracy that can arbitrarily dictate policy.|$|E
5|$|Another issue arose when Cardinal Norman Gilroy {{presented}} Heffron in September 1962 with a {{plan for}} State aid to Catholic Church schools, including assistance for teacher salaries and capital grants for buildings, <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> was highly explosive in the sectarian politics of New South Wales at the time. Heffron, alive {{to the need for}} a limited form of state support to placate sectarian conflict that could destroy the government, permitted Treasurer Jack Renshaw to include state support for school laboratories and a means-tested allowance to school students in the 1963 budget. Heffron later dropped the school laboratory provision but his permitting of the means-tested allowance provoked condemnation from the Federal Party Executive in Adelaide on 30 September 1962, who were less interested in placating the traditional Catholic hierarchy and more informed by the bitterness of the earlier ALP/DLP split in the party in 1955. Heffron and Renshaw backed down on this last provision, leaving no state aid for Catholic schools, and affirming the dominance of the Federal party in such matters.|$|E

5|$|Fowler {{began the}} 2001â€“02 season controversially, after being {{dropped by the}} then manager GÃ©rard Houllier from the Liverpool squad for the 2001 Charity Shield match {{following}} a training ground confrontation with assistant manager Phil Thompson. He made an appearance in Liverpool's 3â€“2 European Super Cup victory over Bayern Munich, but starts were intermittent. In October 2001, he scored his first league hat-trick for three years, helping Liverpool beat Leicester City 4â€“1, but was dropped for the following league match. Though Fowler {{had been on a}} contract extension from 1999 (unlike Steve McManaman â€“ who exercised his Bosman entitlement the very same year), Fowler was linked to Lazio, Arsenal and Leeds, and Liverpool's management as well as fans and the media constantly reported that what happened with McManaman (regarded as a huge financial loss) would never be repeated and thus the club never rejected those bids without consideration. This meant that coupled with Fowler's relationship with Houllier, speculation over Fowler's future persisted for most of Houllier's tenure and became <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> divided Liverpool fans. His last appearance for Liverpool was against Sunderland, in which he was substituted at half-time.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to combat changes, the Solo Remix includes redrawn high-definition sprites and is optimized for the Retina display of iOS devices. The original soundtrack and additional remixes {{of these songs}} are included. Wireless and social media features are also included: the Tin Pin Slammer can be played with other players via wireless connections, and the game can connect with the player's social media applications to display these as scanned thoughts from non-player characters within the game. The Solo Remix version features a remixed soundtrack from the original DS release. New assets {{at the conclusion of}} the iOS game hint at a possible sequel, but no confirmation has been made by Square Enix. The iOS version of the game was pulled from the iOS App Store in February 2015 due to <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> prevented the game from working with the iOS 8 operating system launched in September 2014, though the Android version remains available.

When rock band Metallica released their album Death Magnetic on September 12, 2008, it was also made available as a downloadable song pack for Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, Guitar Hero World Tour and the 2009 spin-off Guitar Hero Metallica.

5|$|The {{selected}} {{project was}} a spin-off {{that was being}} developed by an inexperienced team under director Kazuhiro Aoyama. The spin-off was originally intended to introduce a new character {{who would have to}} escape from an infected Raccoon City. However, after the promotion, Capcom decided that Resident Evil protagonist Jill Valentine would be the main character and Raccoon City would be destroyed. Unlike the majority of the early scripts in the series, the scenario of the game was not created by Capcom's Flagship studio but by internal Capcom writer Yasuhisa Kawamura, who had very little experience with the Resident Evil series at the time. Kawamura noted that he had to play the original game to familiarize himself with the series' fictional universe immediately. Nevertheless, the story was proofread and sanctioned by Flagship to avoid continuity errors with other installments in the series, <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> was also given attention in monthly meetings between all directors and producers.|$|E
5|$|Wickliffe {{supported}} the annexation of Texas, <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> helped seal Clay's {{defeat in the}} 1844 presidential canvass. In 1845, President James K. Polk sent Wickliffe as an envoy on a secret mission to the Republic of Texas. Originally, his purpose was to quash British and French attempts to forestall the U.S. annexation of Texas, but he later joined Commodore Robert F. Stockton in lobbying leaders of the Republic of Texas to order their military forces across the Rio Grande into Mexico. Stockton and Wickliffe believed that if they could provoke a Texan invasion of Mexico, the United States would have a stronger case for annexing Texas. Ultimately, they failed in convincing the Texans to invade, but succeeded in drumming up support for annexation. Both Wickliffe's position on annexation and his willingness to carry out Polk's assignment further distanced him from the Whigs.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} term as mayor, Armstrong oversaw many issues that {{concerned}} the city. In March 1911, he expressed his support for a new city hall building to be built, expressing his dissatisfaction with the existing building that housed the council and civic employees, mentioning the ever-expanding number of staff. Later in that year, a committee would be formed concerning the issue, and a new structure would be planned with a planned cost of one million dollars. In July of that same year, he would sign a bylaw that would allow an American entrepreneur to establish a gas plant in the city, <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> had been presented to council for debate several months prior. Later that year, {{the prospect of a}} municipal gas plant would also be supplied to city council. In July 1911, when, along with the city council, he dismissed a pair of city commissioners after months of debate. The firing triggered a by-election when alderman James H. McKinley would resign in protest to the action. In 1911, he also served as {{a vice president of the}} Union of Alberta Municipalities. Involved in national and provincial affairs, he voiced his support for a canal to be constructed in the Georgian Bay of Lake Huron, stating that the presence of such canal would improve the trading relations of Canada with the United States by allowing an easier route between the two countries. He also was in favour of a hydroelectric project in the Athabasca River. Additionally, during t{{his first term}} as mayor, Armstrong also oversaw the city's festivities on George V's coronation and moved to form a municipal purchasing department.|$|E
