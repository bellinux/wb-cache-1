40|$|Recently Bernstein [4] has {{provided}} <b>a</b> <b>simpler</b> proof of unpredictability of CBC construction [3] which is giving insight of the construction. Unpredictability of any function intuitively {{means that the}} function behaves very closely to a uniform random function. In this paper we make <b>a</b> unifying and <b>simple</b> approach to prove unpredictability of many existing constructions. We first revisit Bernstein's proof. Using this idea we can show <b>a</b> <b>simpler</b> proof of unpredictability of a class of DAG based construction [7], XCBC [5], TMAC [8], OMAC [9] and PMAC [6]. We also provide <b>a</b> <b>simpler</b> proof for stronger bound of CBC [1] and <b>a</b> <b>simpler</b> proof of security of on-line Hash-CBC [2]. We note {{that there is a}} flaw in the security proof of Hash-CBC in [2]. This paper will help to understand security analysis of unpredictability of many constructions in <b>a</b> <b>simpler</b> way. ...|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Simple</b> Plan is a 1998 American neo-noir crime thriller film {{adapted by}} Scott B. Smith from his 1993 {{novel of the}} same name. Directed by Sam Raimi, it stars Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda. Set in rural Minnesota, <b>A</b> <b>Simple</b> Plan follows {{brothers}} Hank (Paxton) and Jacob Mitchell (Thornton), who, along with Jacob's friend Lou (Brent Briscoe), discover a crashed plane containing $4.4 million in cash. The three men {{go to great lengths}} to keep the money a secret but begin to doubt each other's trust, resulting in lies, deceit and murder.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Simple</b> Plan premiered at the 1998 Toronto International Film Festival, {{where it}} was met with {{critical}} acclaim.
