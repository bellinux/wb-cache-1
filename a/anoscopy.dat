Concomitant anal liquid cytology with p 16 /Ki- 67 immunostaining and HRA with biopsy of acetowhite lugol-negative lesions was performed in HIV-infected MSM. We compared the diagnostic performance of an abnormal anal cytology and p 16 /Ki- 67 immunostaining relative to HRA-guided biopsy by logistic regression and comparison of ROC areas. We included 328 HIV-infected MSM. HSIL was histologically diagnosed in 72 subjects (25. 1 %), and 2 (0. 6 %) were diagnosed with anal cancer. An abnormal cytology showed a sensitivity of 95. 6 % and a specificity of 58. 8 % for the diagnosis of biopsy-proven HSIL.

We modeled the impact of screening strategies and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) coverage on anal cancer incidence in Switzerland. Individual-based, dynamic simulation model parameterized with Swiss HIV Cohort Study and literature data. We assumed all men to be human papillomavirus infected. CD 4 cell count trajectories were the main predictors of anal cancer. From 2016 we modeled cART coverage either as below 100 % (corresponding to 2010 - 2015) or as 100 %, and the following four screening strategies: no screening, yearly anal cytology (Papanicolaou smears), yearly <b>anoscopy</b> and targeted <b>anoscopy</b> 5 years after CD 4 count dropped below 200 cells/μl. Median nadir CD 4 cell count of 6411 MSM increased from 229 cells/μl during 1980 - 1989 to 394 cells/μl during 2010 - 2015; cART coverage increased from 0 to 83. 4 %. Modeled anal cancer incidence peaked at 81. 7 / 100   000 in 2009, plateaued 2010 - 2015 and will decrease to 58. 7 by 2030 with stable cART coverage, and to 52. 0 with 100 % cART coverage.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} high grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (HGAIN), the value of anal cytology in screening for HGAIN, and the characterisation of epidemiological factors and human papillomavirus (HPV) types. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of HIV positive homosexual men. Subjects were interviewed, underwent STD, anal cytological, and HPV screening at enrolment and at subsequent follow up visits with <b>anoscopy</b> and biopsy at the final visit. 57 enrolled, average CD 4 count 273 x 10 (6) /l (10 - 588); 41 completed the cytological surveillance over the follow up period (181 visits, average follow up 17 months), 38 of these had <b>anoscopy</b> and anal biopsy. RESULTS: Oncogenic HPV types were detected in 84 % and high grade dyskaryosis in 10. 5 % (6 / 57) at enrollment. There was a 70 % incidence of high grade dyskaryosis during follow up in patients with negative/warty or low grade dyskaryosis at enrollment. <b>Anoscopy</b> correlated with histology in high grade AIN lesions (sensitivity 91 %, specificity 54 %) and cytology was 78 % sensitive (18 / 23) for HGAIN on biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: AIN and infection with multiple oncogenic HPV types are very common among immunosuppressed HIV positive homosexual men. Apparent progression from low to high grade cytological changes occurred over a short follow up period, with no cases of carcinoma.

40|$|CONTEXT: Anal cancer, {{although}} a still rare disease, is being observed in ascending rates among some population segments {{known to be}} at risk {{for the development of the}} disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, immunodepression and anal intercourse are some factors associated with the development of the malignancy. Its similarities to cervical cancer have led to many studies aiming to establish guidelines for detecting and treating precursor lesions of anal cancer, with the goal of prevention. High-resolution <b>anoscopy</b> is routinely used for the diagnosis of anal cancer precursor lesions in many centers but the medical literature is still deficient concerning the role of this diagnostic modality. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate diagnostic validation and precision measures of high-resolution <b>anoscopy</b> in comparison to histopathological results of anal biopsies performed in HIV-positive patients treated at the Tropical Medicine Foundation of Amazonas, AM, Brazil. To observe any possible association between some risk factors for the development of anal cancer and the presence of anal squamous intraepithelial lesions. METHODS: A hundred and twenty-eight HIV-positive patients were submitted to anal canal cytological sampling for the detection of HPV infection by a PCR based method. High-resolution <b>anoscopy</b> was then performed after topical application of acetic acid 3 % in the anal canal for 2 minutes. Eventual acetowhite lesions that were detected were recorded in respect to location, and classified by their tinctorial pattern, distribution aspect, relief, surface and vascular pattern. Biopsies of acetowhite lesions were performed under local anesthesia and the specimens sent to histopathological analysis. The patients were interviewed for the presence of anal cancer risk factors. RESULTS: The prevalences of anal HPV infection and of anal squamous intraepithelial lesions in the studied population were, respectively, 79 % and 39. 1 %. High-resolution <b>anoscopy</b> showed sensibility of 90 %, specificity of 19. 23 %, positive predictive value of 41. 67 %, negative predictive value of 75 %, and a kappa coefficient of 0. 076. From the analyzed lesions, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions was more frequently observed in association to dense (68 %), flat (61 %), smooth (61 %), non-papillary (83 %) and normal vascular pattern (70 %) acetowhite lesions, while low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions tended to be associated to dense (66 %), flat-raised or raised (68 %), granular (59 %), non-papillary (62 %) and normal vascular pattern (53 %) acetowhite lesions. No statistical significance was observed as to the association of epidemiological characteristics and of most of the investigated anal cancer risk factors and presence of acetowhite lesions or anal squamous intraepithelial lesions. However, anal receptive sex and anal HPV infection were significantly associated to anal squamous intraepithelial lesions (P = 0. 0493 and P = 0. 006, respectively). CONCLUSION: High-resolution <b>anoscopy</b> demonstrated to be a sensitive, but not specific test for the detection of anal squamous intraepithelial lesions. Risk factors anal receptive sex and anal HPV infection were significantly associated to the presence of anal squamous intraepithelial lesions.

A systematic comparison between clinical features and the histopathology of suspect lesions is lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze interobserver agreement in classifying features of intra-anal lesions suspect for anal intraepithelial neoplasia and to compare these features with their histopathological outcome. DESIGN: This study is a cross-sectional survey regarding high-resolution <b>anoscopy</b> with images and biopsies of suspect lesions. Two dermatologists experienced in high-resolution <b>anoscopy,</b> blinded for histopathological outcome, independently classified the lesions on clinical features. SETTING: This investigation was conducted at the Dermatology outpatient clinic of the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. PATIENTS: Included in the study were 163 HIV+ {{men who have sex}} with men, older than 18 years, with no history of anal cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were the -coefficient for interobserver agreement and the proportions of anal intraepithelial neoplasia per clinical feature. RESULTS: Three hundred four biopsies were taken from 163 patients. One hundred sixty-eight biopsies (55 %) showed anal intraepithelial neoplasia, and 67 / 304 (22 %) showed high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia. The -coefficient was 0. 65 for condylomatous lesions, 0. 14 for surface configuration, 0. 54 for punctation, 0. 08 for mosaicism, and 0. 43 for atypical vessels. Condylomatous lesions showed high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia in 18 % (95 % CI, 11 %- 27 %). In lesions with flat leukoplakia, punctation, and atypical vessels, high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia was seen in 25 %, 30 %, and 23 %. In lesions with the combination punctation/atypical vessels and punctation/flat leukoplakia/atypical vessels, high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia was found in 38 % and 40 %. LIMITATIONS: We did not take biopsies of healthy-looking mucosa. Furthermore, the real-time description of features during high-resolution <b>anoscopy,</b> instead of the use of images, would improve the recognition of subtle mucosal abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate to substantial interobserver agreement was demonstrated in recognizing condylomas, punctation, and atypical vessels. Furthermore, high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia is present in a high proportion of intra-anal condylomata.

40|$|Stephen E Weis 1, 2 1 Division of Dermatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth, 2 Preventive Medicine Clinic, Tarrant County Public Health, Fort Worth, TX, USA Abstract: Anal {{squamous}} cell cancer is an uncommon malignancy caused by infection with oncogenic strains of Human papilloma virus. Anal cancer is much more common in immunocompromised persons, including those infected with Human immunodeficiency virus. High-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (HGAIN), the precursor of anal cancer, is identified by clinicians providing care for patients with anorectal disease, and is increasingly being identified during screening of immunosuppressed patients for anal dysplasia. The traditional treatment for HGAIN has been excision of macroscopic disease with margins. This approach is effective for patients with small unifocal HGAIN lesions. Patients with extensive multifocal HGAIN frequently have recurrence of HGAIN after excision, and may have postoperative complications of anal stenosis or fecal incontinence. This led to the suggestion by some that treatment for HGAIN should be delayed until patients developed anal cancer. Alternative approaches in identification and treatment {{have been developed to}} treat patients with multifocal or extensive HGAIN lesions. High-resolution <b>anoscopy</b> combines magnification with <b>anoscopy</b> and is being used to identify HGAIN and determine treatment margins. HGAIN can then be ablated with a number of modalities, including infrared coagulation, CO 2 laser, and electrocautery. These methods for HGAIN ablation can be performed with local anesthesia on outpatients and are relatively well tolerated. High-resolution anoscopy-directed HGAIN ablation is evolving into a standard approach for initial treatment and then subsequent monitoring of a disease which should be expected to be recurrent. Another treatment approach for HGAIN is topical treatment, principally with 5 -fluorouracil or imiquimod. Topical therapies have the advantage of being nonsurgical and are well suited for treating widespread multifocal disease. Topical treatments have the disadvantage of requiring extended treatment courses and causing a symptomatic inflammatory response. Successful treatment requires adherence to a regime that is uncomfortable at best and at worst painful. Topical treatments can be successful in motivated adherent patients willing to accept these side effects.

High-resolution imaging is not adequate for mass screening, and anal cytology requires expertise. New biomarkers, selected because of their use in cervical cancer mass screening, have been originally tested for targeted and easy-to-perform screening. METHODS: 120 HIV-infected individuals (males 96. 4 %, mean age 47 ± 11 years) were referred for clinical examination, <b>anoscopy,</b> and cytological studies on anal swab. Dysplasia grading, Human Papilloma Virus genotyping, E 6 /E 7 mRNA detection and p 16 (INK 4 A) /Ki- 67 immunostaining were performed. High-grade lesions were histologically confirmed by anal biopsies after high-resolution <b>anoscopy.</b> RESULTS: Among the 120 anal swabs analyzed, 36 (30 %) had low grade and 6 (5 %) had high-grade lesions. Virus genotype was identified in 88 patients (73. 3 %), and 77 (64. 2 %) were positive for high-risk genotype(s). High-risk genotype was associated to low-grade or high-grade lesions with a sensitivity of 0. 93 and a specificity of 0. 51. For E 6 /E 7 mRNA, sensitivity and specificity for low-grade and high-grade lesions were, respectively, 0. 88 and 0. 78.

40|$|Background: Anal {{squamous}} intraepithelial lesions (SIL) and cancers are {{increased in}} immunocompromised populations. Based upon anatomic and histologic similarities, the cervix {{is used as}} the model for anal screening. During cervical colposcopy, acetic acid (AA) and Lugol׳s staining (LS) result in characteristic changes that help distinguish low-grade (L) SIL from high-grade (H) SIL. Lesion characteristics were evaluated for their ability to distinguish anal (a) LSIL from anal (a) HSIL during high-resolution <b>anoscopy</b> after application of AA and LS. Methods: AA-stained lesions were described using standard cervical colposcopic criteria. LS was then applied and lesions were characterized as Lugol׳s-negative (L−), Lugol׳s-partial (L+/−), or Lugol׳s positive (L+) and then biopsied. Biopsies were characterized as benign, squamous atypia, LSIL or HSIL. Results: 835 anal lesions were analyzed. Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for aHSIL were highest for characteristics associated with cervical (c) HSIL. L− was independently associated with aHSIL (OR= 4. 7, 95 % CI= 3. 4 – 6. 7). In multiple logistic regression analysis, significant predictors of aHSIL were flat contour (OR= 2. 24, 95 % CI= 1. 3 – 3. 8), mosaic pattern (OR= 2. 0, 95 % CI= 1. 4 – 2. 9), vascular punctation (OR= 1. 5, 95 % CI= 1. 1 – 2. 1) and L− (OR= 2. 3, 95 % CI= 1. 5 – 3. 4). L− staining improved the PPV of aHSIL almost twofold in lesions that otherwise had a colposcopic impression of LSIL.

40|$|HIV-positive MSM are at {{increased}} risk for developing anal squamous cell carcinoma. Detection of precursor lesions of anal cancer [anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) ] is cumbersome and expensive. Our objective was to identify potential risk factors for anal HSIL in HIV-positive MSM to develop more stringent screening criteria. We studied a cohort of MSM screened by high-resolution <b>anoscopy</b> at three HIV clinics in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. For every first high-resolution <b>anoscopy</b> performed in a patient, we analyzed five demographic and seven HIV-related potential risk factors for four different outcome measures: histologically proven anal HSIL vs. no squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), HSIL-anal intraepithelial neoplasia 2 vs. no SIL, HSIL-anal intraepithelial neoplasia 3 vs. no SIL, and HSIL vs. no HSIL. We used univariable and multilevel, multivariable logistic regression. From 2008 through 2015, 497 out of 1678 (30 %) screened HIV-positive MSM had anal HSIL. The mean age was 49 years (SD 9. 6), 96 % used combination antiretroviral therapy, and median duration of combination antiretroviral therapy use was 7. 8 years (interquartile range 4. 0 - 12. 4). Increasing age [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0. 82, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 70 - 0. 94, P =  0. 006] and years living with suppressed viral load [1 - 5 years suppressed aOR 0. 52 (95 % CI 0. 34 - 0. 80), 5. 01 - 10 years aOR 0. 47 (95 % CI 0. 29 - 0. 74), > 10 years aOR 0. 54 [0. 34 - 0. 87], all compared to less than 1 year suppressed, P =  0. 009] were found to be protective for HSIL vs. no SIL. Young HIV-positive MSM without viral suppression are statistically at highest risk for anal HSIL, but given the high prevalence among all virally suppressed men, we advise that all HIV-positive MSM should be screened for HSI...|$|E

This is a single-centered study conducted between May 2010 and May 2014 in patients (n = 201, mean age 37 years) recruited from our outpatient clinic. Samples of anal canal mucosa were taken into liquid medium for PCR HPV analysis and for cytology. <b>Anoscopy</b> was performed for histology evaluation. <b>Anoscopy</b> showed 33. 8 % were normal, 47. 8 % low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), and 18. 4 % HSIL; 80. 2 % had HR-HPV. PCR of HR-HPV had greater sensitivity than did cytology (88. 8 % vs. 75. 7 %) in HSIL screening, with similar positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 20. 3 vs. 22. 9 and 89. 7 vs. 88. 1, respectively. Combining both tests increased the sensitivity and NPV of HSIL diagnosis to 100 %. Correlation of cytology vs. histology was, generally, very low and PCR of HR-HPV vs. histology was non-existent (< 0. 2) or low (< 0. 4). Area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve analysis of cytology and PCR HR-HPV for the diagnosis of HSIL was poor (< 0. 6). Multivariate regression analysis showed protective factors against HSIL were: viral suppression (OR: 0. 312; 95 %CI: 0. 099 - 0. 984), and/or syphilis infection (OR: 0. 193; 95 %CI: 0. 045 - 0. 827). HSIL risk was associated with HPV- 68 genotype (OR: 20. 1; 95 %CI: 2. 04 - 197. 82). When cytology and PCR HR-HPV findings are normal, the diagnosis of pre-malignant HSIL can be reliably ruled-out in HIV suppression with treatment protects against the appearance of HSIL [corrected]...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION [...] Anal intraepithelial {{neoplasia}} (AIN), {{which may}} be a precursor of anal carcinoma, has been identified on histology following minor anal surgical procedures, in particular the removal of perianal condylomata, in increasing numbers of homosexual and bisexual men. Anal cytology has recently been proposed as a useful method of identifying AIN lesions. OBJECTIVE [...] To compare anal cytology with histology {{as a method of}} detecting AIN. METHODS [...] 215 homosexual and bisexual men attending a central London sexually transmitted diseases clinic had an anal cytological smear performed under standard conditions. The perianal area and anal canal were then examined using a colposcope, and areas macroscopically suggestive of intraepithelial neoplasia were biopsied. RESULTS [...] 176 of the 215 patients were biopsied of whom 76 had AIN on histology. 154 of the 215 patients had an adequate anal smear of whom 46 and 85 had cytological features of both HPV and AIN, or HPV alone respectively. Including features of HPV alone as an abnormal smear, anal cytology, when compared with <b>anoscopy</b> and histology as the gold standard for diagnosing AIN, resulted in a sensitivity of 87. 5 %, a specificity of 16. 3 %, a positive predictive value of 37. 4 % and a negative predictive value of 69. 6 %. Restricting abnormal smears to those with features of both HPV and AIN resulted in a sensitivity of 33. 9 %, a specificity of 72. 5 %, a positive predictive value of 41. 3 % and a negative predictive value of 65. 7 %. CONCLUSION [...] Anal cytology is a sensitive but nonspecific method of identifying patients with biopsy proven AIN if cytological features of HPV alone are included as abnormal smears. Specificity is improved by restricting abnormal smears to those with features of both HPV and AIN but this markedly lowers the sensitivity of the test. At present, <b>anoscopy</b> and histology are required in addition to anal cytology to differentiate between patients who simply have anal condylomata and those who also have AIN...|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} of human papillomavirus (HPV) –associated anal cancer in {{men who have}} sex with men (MSM) is striking and has not been mitigated by the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Detection and treatment of high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (HGAIN) may reduce the {{incidence of}} anal cancer. Anal cytology is a useful tool to detect HGAIN; annual screening of HIV-positive MSM and biennial screening of HIV-negative MSM appears to be cost-effective. MSM with abnormal cytology should be referred for high-resolution <b>anoscopy</b> and biopsy. Individuals with HGAIN should receive treatment; treatment modalities for HGAIN demonstrate moderate efficacy and are usually well tolerated, but greater study is required to determine which treatment is optimal. Large prospective studies are needed to document the efficacy of screening and treatment of HGAIN on anal cancer incidence. The HPV vaccine holds promise for primary prevention of anal cancer in MSM, but significant implementation challenges remain...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAnal Intraepithelial Neoplasia (AIN) is an {{increasingly}} common condition {{for which the}} best treatment has not been well established. Traditional management {{was based on a}} ‘watch and wait’ strategy, but as the natural history of AIN and its progression to anal cancer is becoming better understood, more active treatment strategies are warranted. A Best Evidence Topic in Surgery was written according to a structured protocol to address the question whether treatment is indicated in patients with AIN. A total of 169 papers were identified using the defined search criteria. This included only one randomised controlled trial. Case series were therefore also included to help answer the question. The details of the papers were tabulated including relevant outcomes and study weaknesses. We conclude that treatment of high grade AIN, particularly in high risk groups is recommended to try to avoid progression to anal cancer. Treatment options that have shown some benefit include topical use of imiquimod cream or ablation directed by high resolution <b>anoscopy...</b>|$|E
