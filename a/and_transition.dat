5|$|Hydrogen {{is highly}} soluble in many rare earth <b>and</b> <b>transition</b> metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and {{amorphous}} metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals {{is influenced by}} local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice. These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks, but the gas's high solubility is a metallurgical problem, contributing to the embrittlement of many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E
5|$|Organometallic {{compounds}} {{by definition}} contain {{at least one}} carbon-metal bond. A wide range of such compounds exist; major classes include simple alkyl-metal compounds (for example, tetraethyllead), η-alkene compounds (for example, Zeise's salt), and η-allyl compounds (for example, allylpalladium chloride dimer); metallocenes containing cyclopentadienyl ligands (for example, ferrocene); <b>and</b> <b>transition</b> metal carbene complexes. Many metal carbonyls exist (for example, tetracarbonylnickel); some workers consider the carbon monoxide ligand to be purely inorganic, and not organometallic.|$|E

30|$|PNs {{consist of}} places <b>and</b> <b>transitions</b> that are {{connected}} via arcs [12, 13]. A place symbolizes a condition with a finite capacity, and is graphically {{represented by a}} circle [12, 13]. Transitions are graphically illustrated by bars and represent events [12, 13]. The transitions show the interactions between the places [12, 13]. Arcs are directed arrows showing flow and are found between places <b>and</b> <b>transitions</b> or vice versa. However, arcs are never between two places or two transitions; places <b>and</b> <b>transitions</b> are disjointed [12, 13]. The arcs running from places to transitions are described as inputs and arcs running out from transitions to places are described as outputs [12, 13, 14].

5|$|The {{interactions}} of hydrogen with various metals {{are very important}} in metallurgy, as many metals can suffer hydrogen embrittlement, and in developing safe ways to store it {{for use as a}} fuel.

5|$|Those {{materials}} are extremely hard, with the hardness of bulk c-BN being slightly smaller and w-BN even {{higher than that}} of diamond. Polycrystalline c-BN with grain sizes on the order of 10nm is also reported to have Vickers hardness comparable or higher than diamond. Because of much better stability to heat <b>and</b> <b>transition</b> metals, c-BN surpasses diamond in mechanical applications, such as machining steel. The thermal conductivity of BN is among the highest of all electric insulators (see table).|$|E
5|$|When {{diamonds}} {{are grown}} by the high-pressure high-temperature technique, nickel, cobalt {{or some other}} metals are usually added into the growth medium to facilitate catalytically the conversion of graphite into diamond. As a result, metallic inclusions are formed. Besides, isolated nickel and cobalt atoms incorporate into diamond lattice, as demonstrated through characteristic hyperfine structure in electron paramagnetic resonance, optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra, and the concentration of isolated nickel can reach 0.01%. This fact is by all means unusual considering the large difference in size between carbon <b>and</b> <b>transition</b> metal atoms and the superior rigidity of the diamond lattice.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Beaty {{returned}} to Cincinnati {{and raised his}} family. His son, A. Lee Beaty, became an Ohio state legislator and an assistant U.S. District Attorney for southern Ohio. He resumed {{his career as a}} turner and pursued amateur acting and public speaking engagements. He gave public readings for charitable causes and became a well-known elocutionist among the African American community of Cincinnati. Through the 1870s he acted in local theaters and directed music and drama exhibitions in the city. He wrote a play about a rich southern planter entitled Delmar, or Scenes in Southland, which was performed in January 1881 with himself in the lead role. Set in Kentucky, Mississippi, and Massachusetts, the work covered the end of slavery <b>and</b> <b>transition</b> to freedom for blacks from 1860 to 1875. The privately run play was well received, but Beaty did not engage in self-promotion and it never moved into public theaters.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} of boron is nonmetallic in nature. Unlike its heavier congeners, {{it is not known}} to form a simple B3+ or hydrated 3+ cation. The small size of the boron atom enables the preparation of many interstitial alloy-type borides. Analogies between boron <b>and</b> <b>transition</b> metals have been noted in the formation of complexes, and adducts (for example, BH3 + CO →BH3CO and, similarly, Fe(CO)4 + CO →Fe(CO)5), {{as well as in the}} geometric and electronic structures of cluster species such as 2− and 2−. The aqueous chemistry of boron is characterised by the formation of many different polyborate anions. Given its high charge-to-size ratio, boron bonds covalently in nearly all of its compounds; the exceptions are the borides as these include, depending on their composition, covalent, ionic and metallic bonding components. Simple binary compounds, such as boron trichloride are Lewis acids as the formation of three covalent bonds leaves a hole in the octet which can be filled by an electron-pair donated by a Lewis base. Boron has a strong affinity for oxygen and a duly extensive borate chemistry. The oxide B2O3 is polymeric in structure, weakly acidic, and a glass former. Organometallic compounds of boron have been known since the 19th century (see organoboron chemistry).|$|E

5|$|Thermotropic mesophases are {{detected}} and {{characterized by}} two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy, {{in which a}} small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase transitions <b>and</b> <b>transition</b> enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.|$|E
5|$|From left {{to right}} across the four blocks of the long- or 32-column form of the {{periodic}} table {{are a series of}} linking or bridging groups of elements, located approximately between each block. These groups, like the metalloids, show properties in between, or that are a mixture of, groups to either side. Chemically, the group 3 elements, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and actinium behave largely like the alkaline earth metals or, more generally, s block metals but have some of the physical properties of d block transition metals. Lutetium and lawrencium, {{at the end of the}} end of the f block, may constitute another linking or bridging group. Lutetium behaves chemically as a lanthanide but shows a mix of lanthanide <b>and</b> <b>transition</b> metal physical properties. Lawrencium, as an analogue of lutetium, would presumable display like characteristics. The coinage metals in group 11 (copper, silver, and gold) are chemically capable of acting as either transition metals or main group metals. The volatile group 12 metals, zinc, cadmium and mercury are sometimes regarded as linking the d block to the p block. Notionally they are d block elements but they have few transition metal properties and are more like their p block neighbors in group 13. The relatively inert noble gases, in group 18, bridge the most reactive groups of elements in the periodic table—the halogens in group 17 and the alkali metals in group 1.|$|E
5|$|While moving north, the low-and upper-level {{centers of}} Kelly became better aligned on October11, which {{resulted}} in strengthening. At 18:00UTC, Kelly was upgraded into a severe tropical storm by the JMA. Six hours later, the JTWC reported that Kelly attained typhoon intensity. Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also began to monitor the storm, with the agency assigning it the local name Oniang. At 12:00UTC on October12, the JMA followed suit and classified the storm as a typhoon. Twelve hours later, the JMA raised the intensity to , its peak intensity. After maintaining maximum intensity for 72 hours, the storm's forwards motion started to decrease, and on October15, the typhoon turned to the north-northwest despite being forecast to recruve out to sea {{in response to a}} trough located over the Yellow Sea. At midday, the JTWC increased the intensity of Kelly to , equal to Category2 status on the United States-based Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, and its peak intensity. On October16, Kelly began to lose tropical characteristics <b>and</b> <b>transition</b> into an extratropical cyclone. Later that day, the storm passed over Shikoku and then made landfall near Kobe while maintaining typhoon intensity. Kelly then emerged into the Sea of Japan, and at 06:00UTC on October17, the JTWC declared the system an extratropical cyclone. The JMA did the same six hours later, but continued to track the system through October19.|$|E
