50|$|The Gallavardin {{phenomenon}} is a clinical sign found {{in patients with}} aortic stenosis. It is described as the dissociation between the noisy and musical components of the systolic murmur heard in aortic stenosis. The harsh noisy component is best heard at the upper right sternal border radiating to the neck due to the high velocity jet in the ascending aorta. The musical high frequency component is best heard at the cardiac apex. The presence of a murmur at the apex can be misinterpreted as mitral regurgitation. However, the <b>apical</b> <b>murmur</b> of the Gallavardin phenomenon does not radiate to the left axilla and is accentuated by a slowing of the heart rate (such as a compensatory pause after a premature beat) whereas the mitral regurgitation murmur does not change.|$|E

40|$|AN {{aneurysm}} {{restricted to}} the left aortic 1 A. t sinus is extremely rare. Aneurysms of an aortic sinus most often involve the right (related to the right coronary artery) or the posterior (noncoronary) sinuses. The left aortic sinus may participate {{with the other two}} in aneurysmal dilatation, such as occurs in the Marfan syndrome. Described in this communication is an aneurysm that involved the territory of the left aortic sinus in a pa-tient with a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve. The purposes of this report are to demon-strate that an aneurysm may occur in this region and to indicate that by displacing and compressing the left coronary artery, the aneurysm was responsible for coronary insuffi-ciency and myocardial infarction.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of classical mitral stenosis is easy, but many pitfalls lead to over-diagnosis or under-diagnosis. These {{have been considered}} in detail and variations in symptoms and signs have been illustrated by case histories. Such variations include: (1) Embolism producing the Leriche syndrome; (2) mitral stenosis with insignificant hemodynamic effect; (3) myxoma masquerading as mitral stenosis; (4) mitral stenosis without <b>apical</b> <b>murmurs,</b> and (5) mitral stenosis with a systolic murmur predominant or alone. In cases of combined mitral and aortic stenosis, the history, radiographic configuration, and incidence of hemoptysis, edema, bronchitis, embolism and atrial fibrillation resemble such findings in cases of isolated mitral stenosis, but the auscultatory signs of the latter may be obscured.

40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] 46 -year-old White man had a 2 -year history of frequent atypical chest pain associated with palpitations and presyncope. Clinical examination revealed an intermittent mid-systolic non-ejection click followed by a blowing mid-to-late systolic murmur indicative of the billowing mitral leaflet syndrome (BMLS) (primary mitral valve prolapse (MVP); Barlow's syndrome). This diagnossis was confirmed on cardiac catheterization, left ventricular cine angiography showing mild mitral insufficiency. M-mode and cross-sectional echocardiograms failed to show the MVP, although phonocardiography documented the intermittent non-ejection click and mid-systolic <b>apical</b> <b>murmur.</b> Ambulatory Holter monitoring showed symptomatic inferolateral myocardial ischaemia, and maximal stress-testing elicited asymptomatic ischaemia in the same zone. Selective coronary angiography delinated a normal left coronary artery and an insignificant fixed obstructive lesion {{in the second part}} of the dominent right coronary artery (RCA). Provocation with ergometrine (ergonovine) maleate gave rise to severe coronary vasospasm superimposed on the insignificant lesion in the RCA. This spasm provoked myocardial ischaemia resulting in symptomatic ventricular fibrillation which was successfully reserved. The patient's symptoms have been fairly well controlled by nitrates and nifedipine. As far as I am aware this is the first documentation of coronary vasospasm in the BMLS. In this syndrome coronary artery spasm has often been postulated to be responsible for acute myocardial infarction with a normal appearance of the coronary arteries on angiography. This mechanism has also been incriminated in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias in cases of primary MVP. These various contentious and important issues are reviewed. Publisher’s versio...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{determine}} how reliable a guide an <b>apical</b> systolic <b>murmur</b> can be to the finding at mitral valvotomy of incidental mitral regurgitation complicating dominant mitral stenosis. The history of the systolic murmur in mitral stenosis is a confused one, since general agreement was not reached {{about the timing of}} systolic and diastolic murmurs in mitral stenosis for nearly a century after Laennec (1819) first described the " bruit de souffiet " and " bruit de scie. " Thus Ormerod (1864), Dickinson (1887), and Brockbank (1910) held that the characteristic murmur in mitral stenosis was in early systole and due to associated mitral regurgitation. On the other hand, Fauvel (1843), Gairdner (1861), and Fagge (1870) believed that the murmur was in late diastole and resulted from obstruction to the passage of blood through the mitral valve, as Laennec had originally suggested. With the advent of the electrocardiogram and phonocardiogram, the time of the murmur was fixed more accurately in the cardiac cycle. It became accepted that both diastolic and systolic murmurs were heard in mitral stenosis, the diastolic murmur being of chief importance as indicating stenosis, the systolic murmur, when present, being of secondary signifi-cance only, since it indicated merely a degree of incidental mitral regurgitation.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of early rheumatic carditis usually {{depends upon the}} detection of murmurs pro-duced by acute valvulitis. It {{may be difficult to}} evaluate clinically the significance of certain murmurs occurring in patients with rheumatic fever, though the development of a loud <b>apical</b> pansystolic <b>murmur</b> in a patient already under observation usually presents no diagnostic problem. More frequently a systolic murmur is present when the patient is first seen: then the distinction between systolic murmurs of basal and of mitral origin may be difficult, and in the presence of fever, pain, and resultant tachycardia, it may be impossible to ascertain the significance of the murmur by auscultation alone. The undoubted presence of a mitral diastolic murmur is diagnostic of mitral valvulitis, but the faint short diastolic murmur that first appears is readily confused with a loud third sound or summation gallop, and the clinical distinction between diastolic sounds and murmurs may be uncertain. Similarly {{it may be difficult to}} be sure of the presence of the soft aortic diastolic " whiff " of acute aortic valvulitis. It was therefore decided to investigate these murmurs by phono-cardiography. There have been very few reports of the phonocardiographic findings in acute rheumatic carditis.

Lung injury {{is one of the}} main perioperative complications. Few data are available about cardiac trauma and VTS-related false aneurysm of the left ventricular (LV) wall has not yet been reported. METHODS A 62 -year old woman presented with a left thoracic empyema. Video-thoracoscopy was attempted for bacterial sampling and surgical drain of the pleura. A rapid conversion to open thoracotomy was necessary to control massive bleeding after the first thoracic port intrusion. An <b>apical</b> systolic <b>murmur</b> was found 2 weeks later during a systematic clinical examination. The patient was asymptomatic and had no personal history of cardiac disease. RESULTS Colour Doppler imaging showed two spurious aneurysms on the LV wall without any haemopericardium. Pericardial enhancement around the left ventricle was observed on the chest computerized tomography scan with the injection of contrast. After the careful excision of the two false aneurysms, a surgical repair was strengthened with a suture under a cardiopulmonary bypass. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was safe at 3 years. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report of LV traumatic false aneurysms secondary to an attempt of a video-thoracoscopic procedure.

No such case has been reported in persons with a history of rectal foreign body insertion despite its potential for greater trauma. Case presentation A 58 -year-old male was admitted with confusion and inability to speak. His past history was notable for hospitalization to extract a retained plastic soda bottle from the rectosigmoid two years prior. On examination, he was febrile, tachycardic and hypotensive. There was an <b>apical</b> pansystolic <b>murmur</b> on cardiac examination. He had a mixed receptive and expressive aphasia, and a right hemiparesis. On rectal examination he had perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed infarction of the occipital and frontal lobes. Transesophageal Echocardiography of the heart revealed vegetations on the mitral valve. All of his blood culture bottles grew methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. He was successfully treated for bacterial endocarditis with intravenous nafcillin and gentamicin. The rectum is frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus and trauma to its mucosa can lead to bacteremia and endocarditis with this organism. In the absence of corroborative evidence such as presented here, it is difficult to make a correlation between staphylococcal endocarditis and anorectal foreign body insertion due to patients being less than forthcoming Conclusion There is a potential risk of staphylococcal bacteremia and endocarditis with rectal foreign body insertion.

Upon presentation to Cornell, Sammy was quiet, alert, and responsive, but was very lethargic. Physical examination revealed severe bradycardia with audible S 4 heart sounds and a grade III/VI left <b>apical</b> systolic <b>murmur.</b> Jugular pulses were present, and femoral pulses were strong bilaterally. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed third degree AV block with an atrial rate of 160 bpm and a ventricular escape rhythm of 20 - 22 bpm. Thoracic radiographs taken at the referring veterinarian revealed mild cardiomegaly with normal pulmonary vasculature. Echocardiography was performed and showed mild to moderate dilation of all four cardiac chambers. The left ventricle was hyperdynamic with an increased fractional shortening (43 %). There was moderate mitral insufficiency during both systole and diastole. Severe thickening and prolapsing of the mitral valve was diagnosed as presumptive valvular endocardiosis. The treatment of choice for complete heart block, whether the animal is symptomatic or not, is transvenous pacemaker implantation. That same afternoon, a transvenous permanent pacemaker was surgically implanted in Sammy.

At the period of manifestations in function of` the Amyl-Nitrite, were not found significant differences with maximum, minimum and mean blood pressure measured before ihalation. 2) Duration of the first sound was tend to prolong in the hypertensive (0. 076 ± 0. 020 sec), less prolonged in the health (0. 065 ± 0. 016 sec). This prolongation was not correlated with maximum and minimum blood pressuse measured before inhalation. 3) Cases showed absolute shortening of the QⅡ interval were increased in the hypertensive. Those shortenings were correlated with LVH. As QII interval was shortened as QⅡ/QT. ratio was decreased. 4) Protodiastolic gallop sound (accentuation of the third heart sound) became significant after inhalation in the hypertensive, and was correlated with LVH. 5) Atrial gallop sound (accentuation of the atrial sound) was accentuated after inhalation in the hypertensive, too. This fact was in discordance with the old reports. The accentuation was connected with LVH. 6) Duration of <b>apical</b> systolic <b>murmur</b> was prolonged in the hypertensive lasting 60 sec after inhalation, and it's amplitude was increased. Some cases showed a new murmur after inhalation. 7) Increase of the amplitude was correlated with ST-T change and accentuation of atrial gallop sound. However, mechanism of Amyl-Nitrite for the accentuation of murmur remained uncertain...|$|R
40|$|A 1 -year-old Welch Pony filly {{presented}} to the Medicine Service at Cornell University's Large Animal Hospital with a 3 -week history of intermittent fevers, lethargy, petechiae and shifting lameness. Prior antibiotic therapy failed to result in resolution of the clinical signs. Physical exam revealed left and right sided, grade III out of VI, <b>apical,</b> holosystolic heart <b>murmurs.</b> In addition, a grade IV out of VI "to and fro" murmur was auscultated over the left heart base. Clinical pathology identified a mild anemia, leukocytosis with a mature neutrophilia, and a severe thrombocytopenia. The presence of a fever of unknown origin, heart murmurs and leukocytosis led to a presumptive diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis. Other differential diagnoses considered included chronic inflammation, chronic infection, neoplasia, and immune mediated disease. Two-dimensional echocardiography identified severe vegetative lesions on the mitral, tricuspid, and aortic valves. Color flow Doppler showed mitral, tricuspid and aortic insufficiency, along with mild aortic stenosis. Due to the grave prognosis, the owners elected to have the pony euthanized. The diagnosis was confirmed with gross and histological post-mortem examination. This paper will discuss the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis and its potential consequences...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that isolated {{coarctation of the aorta}} is associated with relative hypoplasia of the mitral valve, even when the valve is morphologically normal. DESIGN [...] Cross sectional and Doppler echocardiography were used in a prospective, paired, case control study to compare mitral valve dimensions and diastolic transmitral flow characteristics as indices of left heart development. 40 children with isolated coarctation and 40 size matched controls were examined. Within the coarctation group 14 children with <b>apical</b> diastolic <b>murmurs</b> were compared with 14 size matched patients without murmurs. SETTING [...] A supraregional tertiary referral centre for paediatric cardiology. OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Mitral valve diameters, measured from the parasternal long axis, short axis, and apical four chamber views; mitral valve cross sectional area measured from the parasternal short axis view; peak early (E) and peak atrial (A) phase diastolic transmitral flow velocities measured by pulsed wave Doppler from the apical four chamber view; derived E/A ratio and pressure half time of decay from peak E. RESULTS [...] Mitral valve dimensions were significantly smaller in children with coarctation than in controls for long axis diameter (median 1. 74 v 1. 90 cm, p = 0. 0001), short axis diameter (2. 21 v 2. 28 cm, p = 0. 027), and cross sectional area (2. 37 v 3. 15 cm 2, p = 0. 001). Peak E and A velocities were significantly higher in patients than in controls (0. 9 v 0. 82 ms- 1, p = 0. 013 and 0. 61 v 0. 51 ms- 1, p = 0. 007). The only difference between children with coarctation plus murmurs and those without murmurs was a marginally longer pressure half time. CONCLUSIONS [...] Smaller mitral valve dimensions and increased diastolic transmitral flow velocities in children with isolated coarctation compared with normal children suggests that coarctation may be part of a generalised hypoplasia of left heart structures...|$|R
