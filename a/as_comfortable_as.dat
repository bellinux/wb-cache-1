25|$|Orr's {{motivation}} throughout is {{to escape}} the squadron and the war. He is also known for being very mechanically adept and uses his skills to make his and Yossarian's tent <b>as</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> possible.|$|E
25|$|Mallison and Chapman {{spent the}} first few hours sorting out the {{submersible}} which was almost upside down. They checked all the watertight doors for leaks and prepared for rescue to come. To preserve oxygen {{they knew they had}} to make as little physical exertion as possible, not even speaking. They made themselves <b>as</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> possible as high up as they could get to avoid the foul air that sank down.|$|E

25|$|For {{many years}} after electrification, and the {{consequent}} removal of diesel locomotives from passenger services, Class 317 electrical multiple units operated all services out of King's Lynn; while they were not <b>as</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> the previous fleet of locomotive-hauled coaches, they quickly developed a reputation for reliability. Today's services are mostly operated by Class 387s. Abellio Greater Anglia operate weekday peak-hour services between King's Lynn and London Liverpool Street using Class 379s.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{it can be}} {{observed}} that many companies {{try to make the}} workplace <b>as</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> possible for the employees. This is achieved by light flooded rooms, Feng Shui methods in the workplace or even by creative jobs. The efficiency and creativity of the employees is to be promoted by a pleasant atmosphere at the workplace. Approaches of the Scientific Management, in which attempts are also made to make the work environment pleasant, are partly recognizable here.|$|E
25|$|The {{three other}} {{survivors}} were many miles from a settlement and {{were forced to}} survive on shell fish and dead penguins cast up by the sea. Unable {{to keep up with}} the others due to injuries and exposure, Kilpatrick was too ill to continue. The two others made him <b>as</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> possible and he was left behind. Simpson and Mitchell were eventually found seventeen days after the disaster in a terrible state, slowly making their way to the Cape Borda Lightstation. They were without food, having given all they possessed to Kilpatrick, but the remains of two dead penguins were tied around their necks.|$|E

25|$|Yet {{another reason}} is the {{economic}} clout generated by this class. In 2005 according to U.S.Census statistics, the top third of society, excluding the top 5%, controlled the largest share of income in the United States. Although some in the statistical middle class (for example, police officers and fire fighters in the more affluent suburbs in the San Francisco Bay Area) may have lifestyles <b>as</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> those found among {{the ranks of the}} professional middle class, only few have the same degree of autonomy and influence over society as those in the professional middle class. Other white-collar members of the statistical middle class may not only be unable to afford the middle-class lifestyle but also lack the influence found in the professional middle class.|$|E
25|$|In early 1893, McCullagh began {{complaining}} of rheumatism and, on February 27, he suddenly fell extremely ill {{while at the}} station house. He declined to go home as his wife was away at Irvington-on-the-Hudson and was confined to bed in his room at the precinct. The doctor found that McCullagh was suffering from sore throat and rheumatism. By the time his wife arrived, McCullagh could not be moved and was made <b>as</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> possible in his official office quarters. He remained bedridden for over a week until March 6 when he his condition unexpectedly worsened and a tracheotomy was performed by police surgeon William F. Fluhrer. This brought only a momentary respite as McCullagh suffered a relapse and died shortly after the operation. His nephew John, also a police captain and later the first Police Chief of Greater New York, was {{with him at the}} time of his death, however his wife had gone back to Irvington in the meantime. He was survived by his widow, two sons and an adopted daughter.|$|E
500|$|In a {{flashback}} sequence {{in one of}} his early episodes, Lucas is subjected to waterboarding, a method of psychological torture. In order to ensure the authenticity of the sequence, Armitage was himself subjected to the actual torture while shooting. He agreed to perform the sequence after he was convinced by consultants for the FSB and CIA. Armitage was only subjected to it for a short time, and was filmed in slow motion to make it appear he was on for longer. The ambient temperature of the room was also raised to make him <b>as</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> possible. However, after the sequence was shot, Armitage changed his opinion entirely, stating; [...] "I only lasted five to ten seconds, and the sound of my voice crying out to stop isn't me acting." [...] Armitage shot more interrogation scenes during production of the eighth series, but only some were added into the episodes. He was [...] "less physical" [...] in the ninth series.|$|E

Armitage was only waterboarded for a short time, and was filmed in slow motion to make it appear as if he was on for longer. Kudos film and television, the production company behind Spooks, had to follow several health and safety provisions from an advisor to ensure the sequence strictly adheres to the advice.

500|$|The {{producers}} {{allow the}} cast to perform {{many of their}} own stunts. In filming fight sequences, they were carefully choreographed beforehand so the actors could participate themselves. The guns featured on the series are real. In scenes where guns are included, an armourer is on hand throughout {{the entirety of the}} sequence to see if the actors are handling them properly and gives out the guns to the actors at the last possible second before filming. After the sequence is shot, the guns have to be returned and locked in a case to prevent anybody from playing with them, even if the guns are not loaded. Among other stunt work, Armitage was asked to be subjected to an actual waterboarding scene to ensure the authenticity of the sequence.

2500|$|As for paraplegics, {{there are}} such things as robotic legs. The ReWalk legs are FDA approved, but are not <b>as</b> <b>{{comfortable}}</b> <b>as</b> they could be for patients.

2500|$|Depending on {{the style}} of bit, {{pressure}} {{can be brought to}} bear on the bars, tongue, and roof of the mouth, as well as the lips, chin groove and poll.

2500|$|The federal army made itself <b>as</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> {{possible}} during its long stay in Alexandria.

[...] While Banks remained in Alexandria {{in the spring of}} 1864, Porter was temporarily trapped north of the city because of the low level of the Red River, four feet instead of the needed seven feet to accommodate gunboats.|$|E

He continued to provide a stream of contributions to various periodicals, primarily The New Monthly Magazine. The topics continued to be his favourites, including critiques of the [...] "new school of reformers", drama criticism, and reflections on manners and the tendencies of the human mind. He gathered previously published essays for the collection The Plain Speaker, writing a few new ones in the process. He also oversaw the publication in book form of his account of his recent Continental tour.|$|E

In {{relation}} to the carriers, Captain (later Major) Henry Steward wrote after the war that [...] "the men on the stretchers ..... tended with the devotion of a mother and the care of a nurse", while Frank Kingsley Norris recounted that, [...] "if night finds the stretcher still on the track, they will find a level spot and build a shelter over the patient. They will make him <b>as</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> possible, fetch him water and feed him if food is available—regardless of their own needs. They sleep four each side of the stretcher and if the patient moves or requires any attention during the night, this is given instantly".|$|E
