5|$|A {{separate}} partnership {{was formed}} between Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca {{to develop the}} Adour <b>afterburning</b> turbofan engine. The Br.121 was proposed with Turbomeca's Tourmalet engine for ECAT but Breguet preferred the RR RB.172 and their joint venture would use elements of both. The new engine, which {{would be used for}} the AFVG as well, would be built in Derby and Tarnos.|$|E
5|$|Required {{power was}} put up {{by a pair of}} <b>afterburning</b> Westinghouse XJ46-WE-02 turbojets, fed from intakes mounted high above the wings to avoid ingesting spray. When these engines were not ready for the prototypes, twin Westinghouse J34-WE-32 engines of just over half the power were installed.|$|E
5|$|The Yakovlev Yak-19 (Russian: Як-19, USAF/DOD {{designation}} Type 7) was {{a prototype}} Soviet fighter built in late 1940s. It {{was the first}} Soviet aircraft to be equipped with an <b>afterburning</b> turbojet, the Klimov RD-10F that {{was derived from the}} German Jumo 004 engine. Only two examples were built as it was rejected for service by the Soviet Air Force.|$|E
5|$|The Adour was {{developed}} into both <b>afterburning</b> and non-afterburning models; the BAE Hawk, which had beaten the Jaguar {{to fulfill the}} Air Staff Target 362 trainer requirement, also adopted the non-afterburning Adour engine developed for the Jaguar. The Adour engine found use in several aircraft abroad, such as the McDonnell Douglas T-45 Goshawk, the Mitsubishi T-2, and the Mitsubishi F-1(which resembles the Jaguar). Even following the Jaguar's retirement in Europe, the Adour {{continues to be an}} active product with new variants being developed. As of February 2013, the Indian Air Force was considering fitting 125 Jaguars with new Honeywell F125IN engines.|$|E
25|$|Jet {{engines are}} {{referred}} to as operating wet when <b>afterburning</b> is being used and dry when the engine is used without <b>afterburning.</b> An engine producing maximum thrust wet is at maximum power or max reheat (this is the maximum power the engine can produce); an engine producing maximum thrust dry is at military power or max dry.|$|E
25|$|The first {{aircraft}} completed {{with only}} the ATAR 101F <b>afterburning</b> turbojet component of the planned turbo-ramjet powerplant.|$|E
25|$|<b>Afterburning</b> Olympus: As {{early as}} 1952, Bristol had {{considered}} {{the use of}} reheat, or <b>afterburning,</b> to augment {{the thrust of the}} Olympus. Initially, a system called Bristol Simplifed Reheat was devised which was tested on a Rolls-Royce Derwent V mounted in an Avro Lincoln. Later it was tested on an Orenda engine in Canada and on an Olympus Mk 100 in the Avro Ashton test bed. Fully variable reheat became possible after an agreement with the Solar Aircraft Company of San Diego which manufactured bench units for the Olympus Mks 101 and 102. An <b>afterburning</b> Olympus was just one proposal for the Vulcan Phase 6, a 350,000 lb aircraft with a 13/14 hour endurance.|$|E
25|$|Until regular {{commercial}} flights by Concorde ceased, the Olympus turbojet {{was unique}} in aviation {{as the only}} <b>afterburning</b> turbojet powering a commercial aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Third {{production}} {{version with}} more powerful engines (5,600 lbf (25.0 kN) dry, 7,400 lbf (32.0 kN) with <b>afterburning</b> J-35-A-21 or −33). 164 built.|$|E
25|$|The {{fighter jet}} was then {{modified}} for the Egyptian Brandner E-300 engine, {{which would have}} an <b>afterburning</b> rating of 4,800kgp, which achieved {{a high level of}} performance.|$|E
25|$|The F-111 used {{a three-point}} landing gear arrangement, with a two-wheel nose gear and two single-wheel {{main landing gear}} units. The landing gear door for the main gear, which was {{positioned}} {{in the center of}} the fuselage, also served as a speed brake in flight. Most F-111 variants included a terrain-following radar system connected to the autopilot. The aircraft was powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30 <b>afterburning</b> turbofan engines. The F-111's variable-geometry wings, escape capsule, terrain following radar, and <b>afterburning</b> turbofans were new technologies for production aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Model 1600 : A {{strengthened}} {{version of}} the F-16 Block 10 with carrier arrestor hook and revised nosewheel. It was powered by the Pratt & Whitney F401 (JTF22A-26C) <b>afterburning</b> turbofan.|$|E
25|$|F8U-2N (F-8D) – {{all-weather}} version, unguided {{rocket pack}} replaced {{with an additional}} fuel tank, J57-P-20 engine with 18,000lbf (80kN) of <b>afterburning</b> thrust, landing system which automatically maintained present airspeed during approach, incorporation of AN/APQ-83 radar. First flight: 16 February 1960, 152 built.|$|E
25|$|Olympus driving aft fan: BS.81 {{rated at}} 28,000lb. As an {{alternative}} to <b>afterburning</b> a fan mounted at {{the trailing edge of}} the wing was proposed for the Vulcan Phase 6. The fan was driven by a turbine in the engine exhaust {{at the end of the}} jetpipe.|$|E
25|$|The Tu-123 was ground-launched with JATO {{boosting}} and {{powered by}} a KR-15 <b>afterburning</b> turbojet in flight. The KR-15 was a lower-cost, short-life, expendable version of the R-15 engine used on the twin-engine, Mach 3-class Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 Foxbat interceptor. The Tu-123 itself was expendable, parachuting its payload to the ground for recovery.|$|E
25|$|XF8U-3 Crusader III (V-401) – {{new design}} {{loosely based on}} the earlier F-8 variants, created to compete against the F-4 Phantom II; J75-P-5A engine with 29,500lbf (131kN) of <b>afterburning</b> thrust, first flight: 2 June 1958, {{attained}} Mach 2.39 in test flights, canceled after five aircraft were constructed because the Phantom II won the Navy contract.|$|E
25|$|The F-111D {{used the}} new Triple Plow II intakes, which were located four inches (100mm) {{further away from}} the {{airframe}} to prevent engine ingestion of the sluggish boundary layer air that was known to cause stalls in the TF30 turbofans. It had more powerful TF30-P-9 engines with 12,000lbf (53kN) dry and 18,500lbf (82kN) <b>afterburning</b> thrust.|$|E
25|$|The Pratt & Whitney F135 is an <b>afterburning</b> {{turbofan}} {{developed for}} the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, a single-engine strike fighter. The F135 family has several distinct variants; a conventional, forward thrust variant and a multi-cycle Short Take-Off Vertical Landing STOVL variant that includes a forward lift fan. The first production engines were scheduled to be delivered in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593 was an Anglo-French <b>afterburning</b> (reheated) {{turbojet}} which powered the supersonic airliner Concorde. It {{was initially}} a joint project between Bristol Siddeley Engines Limited (BSEL) and Snecma. It {{was based on}} the Bristol Siddeley Olympus 22R engine. Rolls-Royce Limited acquired BSEL in 1966 during development of the engine making BSEL the Bristol Engine Division of Rolls-Royce.|$|E
25|$|The F-model {{used the}} Triple Plow II intakes, {{along with the}} {{substantially}} more powerful TF30-P-100 turbofan with 25,100lbf (112kN) <b>afterburning</b> thrust, 35% more thrust than the F-111A and E. An adjustable engine nozzle was added to decrease drag. The P-100 engine greatly improved the F-111F's performance. The engines were upgraded to the TF30-P-109 version, later in the 1985–86 timeframe.|$|E
25|$|The HA-300 was {{originally}} {{designed for the}} <b>afterburning</b> Orpheus BOR 12 turbojet, but the engine did not achieve the minimum level of success Egypt required in the fighter jet. President Nasser saw from the beginning {{a major threat to}} national security by depending on a British engine, because of the hostility that time between Egypt and Great Britain after the 1956 Suez crisis.|$|E
25|$|F8U-2 (F-8C) – J57-P-16 engine with 16,900lbf (75kN) of <b>afterburning</b> thrust, ventral fins added {{under the}} rear {{fuselage}} {{in an attempt}} to rectify yaw instability, Y-shaped cheek pylons allowing two Sidewinder missiles {{on each side of the}} fuselage, AN/APQ-83 radar retrofitted during later upgrades. First flight: 20 August 1957, 187 built. This variant was sometimes referred to as Crusader II.|$|E
25|$|The F-111 pioneered several {{technologies}} for production aircraft, including variable-sweep wings, <b>afterburning</b> turbofan engines, and automated terrain-following radar for low-level, high-speed flight. Its design influenced later variable-sweep wing aircraft, {{and some of}} its advanced features have since become commonplace. The F-111 suffered a variety of problems during initial development. Several of its intended roles, such as an aircraft carrier-based naval interceptor with the F-111B, failed to materialize.|$|E
25|$|The F-111B was {{developed}} in the 1960s by General Dynamics in conjunction with Grumman for the U.S. Navy as part of the joint Tactical Fighter Experimental (TFX) with the United States Air Force (USAF) to produce a common fighter for the services that could perform a variety of missions. It incorporated innovations such as variable-geometry wings, <b>afterburning</b> turbofan engines, and a long-range radar and missile weapons system.|$|E
25|$|Lacking {{experience}} with carrier-based fighters, General Dynamics teamed with Grumman for the assembly {{and testing of}} the F-111B aircraft. In addition, Grumman would also build the F-111A's aft fuselage and the landing gear. The General Dynamics and Grumman team faced ambitious requirements for range, weapons load, and aircraft weight. The F-111 design also included new features on a production military aircraft, such as variable-geometry wings and <b>afterburning</b> turbofan engines.|$|E
25|$|Two powerplants were {{initially}} selected for trials, the General Electric J79 turbojet and the Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan. In the end, the J79 was selected, {{not least because}} it was the same engine used on the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, which the Israelis began to acquire from the United States in 1969, along with a license to produce the J79 themselves. The J79 was clearly superior to the original French Atar 09, providing a dry thrust of 49kN (11,000lbf) and an <b>afterburning</b> thrust of 83.4kN (18,750lbf).|$|E
25|$|The {{reconnaissance}} {{version of}} the Vigilante, the RA-5C, had slightly greater wing area and added a long canoe-shaped fairing under the fuselage for a multi-sensor reconnaissance pack. This added an APD-7 side-looking airborne radar (SLAR), AAS-21 infrared line scanner, and camera packs, as well as improved ECM. An AN/ALQ-61 electronic intelligence system could also be carried. The RA-5C retained the AN/ASB-12 bombing system, and could, in theory, carry weapons, although it never did in service. Later-build RA-5Cs had more powerful J79-10 engines with <b>afterburning</b> thrust of 17,900lbf (80kN). The reconnaissance Vigilante weighed almost five tons more than the strike version with almost the same thrust and an only modestly enlarged wing. These changes cost it acceleration and climb rate, though it remained fast in level flight.|$|E
25|$|During one {{successful}} test flight, Mach 1.38 {{was achieved}} by a scale model in normally controllable transonic and supersonic level flight, a unique achievement at that time which validated the aerodynamics of the M.52. At that point, the ministry had cancelled that project and issued a new requirement, which would ultimately result in the English Electric Lightning interceptor aircraft. Work on the <b>afterburning</b> version of the Power Jets W.B.2/700 turbojet was also cancelled and the Power Jets company was incorporated into the National Gas Turbine Establishment. The design and the research gained from the M.52 was shared with the American company Bell Aircraft, who applied it to their own Bell X-1 high speed prototype aircraft, which {{went on to become}} the first aircraft to exceed the speed of sound in 1947.|$|E
25|$|The F-111B was an {{all-weather}} {{interceptor aircraft}} intended to defend U.S. Navy carrier battle groups against bombers and anti-ship missiles. The F-111 features variable geometry wings, an internal weapons bay and a cockpit with {{side by side}} seating. The cockpit {{is part of an}} escape crew capsule. The wing sweep varies between 16 degrees and 72.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). The airframe consisted mostly of aluminum alloys with steel, titanium and other materials also used. The fuselage is a semi-monocoque structure with stiffened panels and honeycomb sandwich panels for skin. The F-111B was powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30 <b>afterburning</b> turbofan engines and included the AN/AWG-9 radar system for controlling the AIM-54 Phoenix air-to-air missiles. Poor visibility over the nose made the aircraft more difficult to handle for carrier operations.|$|E
25|$|The MiG-21 was {{the first}} {{successful}} Soviet aircraft combining fighter and interceptor characteristics in a single aircraft. It was a lightweight fighter, achieving Mach 2 with a relatively low-powered <b>afterburning</b> turbojet, and is thus comparable to the American Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter and the French Dassault Mirage III. Its basic layout was used for numerous other Soviet designs; delta-winged aircraft included Su-9 interceptor and the fast E-150 prototype from MiG bureau while the mass-produced successful front fighter Su-7 and Mikoyan's I-75 experimental interceptor combined a similar fuselage shape with swept-back wings. However, the characteristic layout with the shock cone and front air intake did not see widespread use outside the USSR and finally proved to have limited development potential, {{mainly because of the}} very small space available for the radar.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} with the F8U-1s and -2s, the Crusader design team was also working on a larger aircraft with even greater performance, internally designated as the V-401. Although externally similar to the Crusader and sharing with it such design elements as the variable incidence wing, the new fighter was larger and was powered by the Pratt & Whitney J75-P-5A engine generating 29,500lbf (131kN) of <b>afterburning</b> thrust. To deal with Mach2+ flight conditions it was fitted with large vertical ventral fins under the tail which rotated to the horizontal position for landing. To ensure sufficient performance, Vought made provisions for a Rocketdyne XLF-40 liquid-fueled rocket motor with 8,000lbf (35.6kN) of thrust {{in addition to the}} turbojet. Avionics included the AN/AWG-7 fire control computer, AN/APG-74 radar, and AN/ASQ-19 datalink. The system was expected to simultaneously track six and engage two targets.|$|E
25|$|F-106A : (Convair Model 8-24) Improved {{version of}} the F-102. Fitted with the MA-1 Integrated Fire Control System with SAGE datalink, J-75 <b>afterburning</b> turbojet, {{enlarged}} intake, variable-geometry inlet ramps and shortened intake ducts, refined fuselage shape, modified wings and redesigned tailfin; tailpipe fitted with a device to reduce the tendency of the jet exhaust to blow unsecured objects around while taxiing, yet allowing virtually maximum performance at high thrust settings including afterburner. Performance was deemed unsatisfactory and modifications were made. The aircraft was capable of low supersonic speeds without afterburner (but with a significant range penalty) and had a maximum altitude at least 57,000ft. Many were fitted with a conically-cambered wing for improved takeoff, supersonic and high-altitude flight. To improve the aircraft's range the aircraft was fitted with two streamlined external supersonic tanks that still kept the aircraft capable of sustained roll rates of 100 degrees per second. Since these tanks produced virtually no significant performance degradation they were rarely jettisoned and were routinely carried around. After 1972, many F-106s were refitted with a new canopy featuring improved visibility, improved optic sights and provision for a gunpack in the center weapons bay.|$|E
500|$|MiG-9 (FF) I-307 [...] two prototypes with <b>afterburning</b> RD-20F or RD-21 engines ...|$|E
500|$|... 150F – One 150 {{prototype}} {{was modified}} with a Izdeliye YuF engine, an <b>afterburning</b> RD-10.|$|E
500|$|Izdeliye 156 [...] - Originally {{known as}} Aircraft 152D. A {{modified}} 152 with a YuF engine, an <b>afterburning</b> {{version of the}} RD-10.|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, the OKB {{had been}} {{developing}} two <b>afterburning</b> {{versions of the}} RD-10 {{in an effort to}} increase the engine's power. The more successful model was only [...] longer and weighed an additional [...] more than the original engine. Its power, however, was increased by an additional , over 30% more thrust. This engine was designated the izdeliye YuF by the bureau and was fitted into an aircraft 150 prototype in July 1947, designated as the 150F. The additional power increased the aircraft's top speed to [...] at sea level and [...] at an altitude of [...] This made the 150F the second-fastest Soviet fighter of the period, after the MiG-9 powered by two <b>afterburning</b> RD-21 engines. Nevertheless, Lavochkin decided not to submit the 150F for state acceptance trials as the fundamental design flaws of the airframe still had not been resolved.|$|E
