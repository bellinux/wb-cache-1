40|$|Infrastructure {{development}} {{is considered a}} key facilitator for achieving economic growth in developed as well as developing world, and has {{a direct impact on}} the growth and overall development of an economy. Iraq, similar to many developing countries, has a considerable lack of infrastructure. Nevertheless, it has been found that attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can {{play an important role in}} addressing this lack. A vital step for governments to attract FDI is to create an organisational environment attractive to Multinational Corporations (MNCs). Iraq is internationally recognised as a country whose government organisations are highly corrupted and hard to do business with, a situation which has also significantly contributed to the underdevelopment of infrastructure in the country. A number of organisational performance improvement models, such as EFQM, Baldrige and PROBE, can identify and improve organisational practice and reduce performance weaknesses. However, these approaches are lengthy and their implementation can thus jeopardise any improvement due to the lack of quick wins. Given the urgency of <b>addressing</b> <b>Iraq’s</b> infrastructure needs, this research focuses on developing an approach to help Iraqi decision makers create an organisational environment attractive to MNCs in a step-change fashion. To achieve this goal, four research stages were established. The first was conducting an extensive literature review; this identified six critical steps in creating an organisational environment attractive to MNCs. The second, or exploratory, stage applied these steps, assessing Iraqi organisational practices, comparing them to world-class standards and identifying key weaknesses and strengths. The third, development, stage focused on using the findings from the exploratory stage and the literature to develop and propose an approach to creating an organisational environment attractive to MNCs. This framework was validated in the fourth stage, using case studies. The key results of this research showed that an effective and quicker approach for decision makers of Iraqi government organisations to creating an organisational environment attractive for MNCs is by establishing separate spinout organisation(s) dedicated to working exclusively with MNCs throughout the lifecycle of infrastructure development programmes. Their successful implementation will pave the way for large-scale reform for government organisations in Iraq. However, such an approach is entirely dependent on achieving top management support and commitment to change. This research contributes to knowledge by providing an alternative approach to the existing improvement methods that can help government organisations similar to the ones in Iraq, overcome their performance weaknesses and create effective organisational environment in the short term...|$|R

5000|$|Contrary to Nuri as-Said, {{his primary}} foreign {{focus was on}} the {{strengthening}} of the Arab League and the integration of Iraq into that organization. Hamdi emphasized co-operation among the Arab countries {{in the spirit of}} Arab nationalism, unlike Nuri, who focused on increasing the political power of Iraq within the League. He succeeded in maintaining excellent ties with the Egyptian and Syrian politicians, despite significant protest against their dominance in the League and region. As Prime Minister, Hamdi al-Pachachi released many of the nationalists who had been detained after the 1941 Iraqi coup d'état, having been a supporter of it himself, but he had to face the growing Kurdish rebellion led by Mulla Mustafa. Al-Pachachi rejected their terms, and they revolted in mid-1945 but had to flee to Iran in October. Al-Pachachi’s victory over the Kurds made him more popular with others, and in December he called for greater political freedom for political parties with free elections. On May 29, 1945, France bombed Damascus and tried to arrest its democratically elected leaders who were demanding their full independence from French occupation. When Hamdi al-Pachachi returned to Baghdad from the Arab League conference in Cairo on June 15, he stated [...] "We will soon be rid of the nightmare of French imperialism in the Levant. The Arab states will enjoy their legitimate rights and international status thanks to united Arab effort." [...] On October 4th 1945 Al-Pachachi in his capacity as Prime Minister of <b>Iraq</b> <b>addressed</b> a letter to the United States government, stating in reaction to President Truman's calls to open Palestine for Jewish immigration [...] "The Iraq government regards it as its duty to inform the American Government that it deems any support of Zionism as contrary to the interests of the Iraqi State and the Arab peoples generally. In view of the friendship that Iraq feels towards the Americans it is hoped that America will avoid causing injury to the Arabs in their homelands by such intervention. Zionism is an aggressive move towards the heart of the Arab nation. The Arabs intend to use all means at their disposal to defend existence and the safety and security of their home." ...|$|R
