40|$|We present defect {{detection}} of polyethylene (PE) pipes by using <b>active</b> <b>infrared</b> thermography technique. A {{finite element model}} was built to mimic the transient heat transfer in PE pipes, in which constant heat flux boundary condition {{was applied to the}} inner surface of the PE pipes. Various defects with different diameters and depths were simulated in PE pipes and they would affect the thermal distributions from which the relation between thermal images and defect sizes and locations would be established. An electrical heating bar, as the novel thermal excitation source, was employed in <b>active</b> <b>infrared</b> thermography experimental system. The finite element simulation results are well agreed with the one obtained from the infrared imaging experiments and it demonstrated that finite element numerical method can be an effective method to analyze infrared imaging.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the suitability of <b>active</b> <b>infrared</b> thermography and thermometry in combination with multivariate statistical partial least squares analysis as rapid soil water content detection techniques both in the laboratory and the field. Such techniques allow fast soil water content measurements helpful in both agricultural and environmental fields. These techniques, based on the theory of heat dissipation, were tested by directly measuring temperature dynamic variation of samples after heating. For the assessment of temperature dynamic variations data were collected during three intervals (3, 6 and 10 s). To account for the presence of specific heats differences between water and soil, the analyses were regulated using slopes to linearly describe their trends. For all analyses, the best model was achieved for a 10 s slope. Three different approaches were considered, two in the laboratory and one in the field. The first laboratory-based one was centred on <b>active</b> <b>infrared</b> thermography, considered measurement of temperature variation as independent variable and reported r = 0. 74. The second laboratory–based one was focused on <b>active</b> <b>infrared</b> thermometry, added irradiation as independent variable and reported r = 0. 76. The in-field experiment was performed by <b>active</b> <b>infrared</b> thermometry, heating bare soil by solar irradiance after exposure due to primary tillage. Some meteorological parameters were inserted as independent variables in the prediction model, which presented r = 0. 61. In order to obtain more general and wide estimations in-field a Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis on three classes of percentage of soil water content was performed obtaining a high correct classification in the test (88. 89 %). The prediction error values were lower in the field with respect to laboratory analyses. Both techniques could be used in conjunction with a Geographic Information System for obtaining detailed information on soil heterogeneity...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{multi-sensor}} approach to the detection and inspection of steel bars in reinforced concrete structures.

In this article <b>active</b> <b>infrared</b> thermography with microwave excitation is analyzed both by numerical modeling and experiments. This method, based on thermal imaging, due to its characteriatics should be considered as a preliminary method for the assessment of relatively shallowly located steel bar reinforcements.
