Each year between 50 and 528million people are {{infected}} and approximately 10,000 to 20,000 die. The earliest descriptions of an outbreak date from 1779. Its viral cause and spread were understood by the early 20th century. Apart from eliminating the mosquitoes, work is ongoing for medication targeted directly at the virus. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease.|$|E
5|$|Although {{scientists}} began observing reduced {{populations of}} several European amphibian species {{already in the}} 1950s, awareness of the phenomenon as <b>a</b> <b>global</b> <b>problem</b> and its subsequent classification as a modern-day mass extinction only dates from the 1980s. By 1993, more than 500 species of frogs and salamanders present on all five continents were in decline. Today, the phenomenon of declining amphibian populations affects thousands of species in all types of ecosystems and is thus {{recognized as one of}} the most severe examples of the Holocene extinction, with severe implications for global biodiversity.|$|E

2500|$|Generally speaking, {{the term}} [...] "local to global" [...] {{refers to the}} idea that <b>a</b> <b>global</b> <b>problem</b> is first done at a local level, which tends to simplify the questions. Then, of course, the {{information}} gained in the local analysis has to be put together to get back to some global statement. For example, the notion of sheaves reifies that idea in topology and geometry.|$|E
2500|$|Third, {{the paradox}} assumes a closed economy in which savings are not {{invested}} abroad (to fund exports of local production abroad). Thus, while the paradox may hold {{at the global}} level, it need not hold at the local or national level: if one nation increases savings, this can be offset by trading partners consuming a greater amount relative to their own production, i.e., if the saving nation increases exports, and its partners increase imports. This criticism is not very controversial, and is generally accepted by Keynesian economists as well, who {{refer to it as}} [...] "exporting one's way out of a recession". They further note that this frequently occurs in concert with currency devaluation (hence increasing exports and decreasing imports), and cannot work as a solution to <b>a</b> <b>global</b> <b>problem,</b> because the global economy is a closed system – not every nation can increase net exports.|$|E

For example, more than three in four young people had insufficient means of shelter and sanitation in some African countries like Malawi. The threat of mass homelessness is greatest in those regions because that is where population is growing fastest. By 2015, the 10 largest cities {{in the world will}} be in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Nine of them will be in developing countries: Mumbai, India– 27.4 million; Lagos, Nigeria– 24.4; Shanghai, China– 23.4; Jakarta, Indonesia– 21.2; São Paulo, Brazil– 20.8; Karachi, Pakistan– 20.6; Beijing, China– 19.4; Dhaka, Bangladesh– 19; Mexico City, Mexico– 18.8.

Skilling, known for his harsh attitude and arrogance, lost his temper on the witness stand during the trial. Enron's bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history when it was filed during December 2001, cost 20,000 employees their jobs. In addition, many of them lost their life savings. Investors also lost billions. However, Skilling and many of the company's executives had sold huge portions of their own Enron stock before the bankruptcy filing, making a substantial profit. When interviewed outside court during the trial by Dutch journalist Stephan Tychon about industrial dominance, Skilling admitted that industrial dominance and abuse constitutes <b>a</b> <b>global</b> <b>problem</b> by saying: [...] "Oh yes, yes sure, it does." [...] On May 25, 2006, the jury returned with the following findings regarding Skilling: ...|$|E

This level is considered a tipping point. [...] "The amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is already above the threshold that can potentially cause dangerous climate change. We are already at risk of many areas of pollution...It's not next year or next decade, it's now." [...] The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has stated [...] "Climate change {{is not just a}} distant future threat. It is the main driver behind rising humanitarian needs and we are seeing its impact. The number of people affected and the damages inflicted by extreme weather has been unprecedented." [...] Further, OCHA has stated:Climate disasters are on the rise. Around 70 percent of disasters are now climate related – up from around 50 percent from two decades ago. These disasters take a heavier human toll and come with a higher price tag. In the last decade, 2.4 billion people were affected by climate related disasters, compared to 1.7 billion in the previous decade. The cost of responding to disasters has risen tenfold between 1992 and 2008.Destructive sudden heavy rains, intense tropical storms, repeated flooding and droughts are likely to increase, as will the vulnerability of local communities in the absence of strong concerted action.Environment destruction caused by humans is <b>a</b> <b>global</b> <b>problem,</b> and this is a problem that is on going every day. By year 2050, the global human population is expected to grow by 2 billion people, thereby reaching a level of 9.6 billion people (Living Blue Planet 24). The human effects on Earth can be seen in many different ways. A main one is the temperature rise, and according to the report ”Our Changing Climate”, the global warming that {{has been going on for}} the past 50 years is primarily due to human activities (Walsh, et al. 20). Since 1895, the U.S. average temperature has increased from 1.3°F to 1.9°F, with most of the increase taken place since around year 1970 (Walsh, et al. 20).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Determining shape from stereo {{has often}} been posed as <b>a</b> <b>global</b> {{minimization}} <b>problem.</b> Once formulated, the minimization problems are then solved {{with a variety of}} algorithmic approaches. These approaches include techniques such as dynamic programming min-cut and alpha-expansion. In this paper we show how an algorithmic technique that constructs a discrete spatial minimal cost surface can be brought to bear on stereo <b>global</b> minimization <b>problems.</b> This problem can then be reduced to a single min-cut problem. We use this approach to solve <b>a</b> new <b>global</b> minimization <b>problem</b> that naturally arises when solving for three-camera (trinocular) stereo. Our formulation treats the three cameras symmetrically, while imposing a natural occlusion cost and uniqueness constraint. ...|$|R
