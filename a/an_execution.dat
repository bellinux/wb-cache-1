5|$|Cordray {{was granted}} a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could not grant a stay of {{execution}} for a death row inmate. At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a referendum to mandate that appeals in death penalty cases be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Steffen v. Tate (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited death row inmates to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay <b>an</b> <b>execution</b> if the case is still in a state court.|$|E

40|$|Introduction This {{presentation}} proposes {{an alternative}} to the current conventional execution of routines. An application can use either or both executions. For example, the alternative execution thus introduces additional techniques for the implementation of a programming language. The current conventional execution of routines generally requires an application to include the details of its reliable, distributed, heterogeneous, adaptive, dynamic, real-time, parallel, secure or other desired execution. Thus for example, a finance expert also needs to be <b>a</b> parallel <b>execution</b> expert in order to produce a finance application with <b>a</b> parallel <b>execution.</b> In contrast, the alternative execution of routines allows an external system to provide an application with <b>a</b> transparent <b>execution.</b> <b>A</b> transparent <b>execution</b> is not visible to the application. This division of labour yields the 2 usual benefits. Returning to the above example, a finance expert need not also be a parallel executio...|$|R
5|$|Double {{standards}} between genders {{and classes}} are exposed throughout the novella. Odysseus commits adultery with Circe while expecting Penelope to remain loyal to him. The maids' {{relations with the}} suitors are seen as treasonous and earn them <b>an</b> <b>execution.</b> Penelope condemns Helen for her involvement in getting men killed at Troy. At the same time, Penelope excuses her involvement in getting the maids killed even though, as Atwood reveals, Penelope enlisted the maids to spy on the suitors and even encouraged them to continue after some were raped.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, U.S. {{federal judge}} Tena Campbell {{rejected}} Gardner's appeal that his attorneys were inadequate {{because they were}} unable to prove that he did not mean to kill his victim. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected motions for appeal by his defense on March 8, 2010. Gardner attempted to give up the process at least three times, but his attorneys convinced him to continue appealing each time. State court Judge Robin Reese signed <b>an</b> <b>execution</b> warrant on April 23 ordering the state to carry out the death sentence.|$|E
5|$|On November 8, 2004, Fletcher {{signed a}} death warrant for Thomas Clyde Bowling, {{who was convicted}} of a double murder in 1990 and sentenced to death by lethal injection. A group of doctors {{requested}} an investigation by the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure to determine whether Fletcher's medical license should be revoked for that action. Kentucky requires doctors to follow the guidelines of the American Medical Association, which forbid doctors from participating in <b>an</b> <b>execution.</b> On January 13, 2005, the Board of Medical Licensure found that Fletcher was acting in his capacity as governor, not as a doctor, when he signed the warrant and ruled that his license was not subject to forfeiture by that action.|$|E

5|$|The Third of May also depicts <b>an</b> <b>execution,</b> {{an early}} {{event in the}} {{so-called}} Peninsular War between France and Spain. Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain in 1808, capturing its royal family and replacing them with his brother, Joseph. The French were as unpopular in Spain as they later were in Mexico, and they encountered a fierce insurrection, which ultimately triumphed. The Third of May execution was an indiscriminate killing of civilians by French soldiers in reprisal for a guerrilla attack the previous day. Goya's painting of the massacre, which shows terrified civilians facing a firing squad, was intended to arouse anger and hatred {{on the part of}} Spanish viewers. Goya's is a highly romantic picture of a deeply emotional episode.|$|E

5|$|When players deal enough {{damage to}} an enemy, they can {{activate}} <b>an</b> <b>execution</b> sequence. Once the execution sequence has been initiated, enemies {{involved in the}} execution are highlighted automatically with colors by the game, and players can perform a series of quick time events by pressing the appropriate buttons. These execution sequences serve to grant additional resources to players, depending on how well the execution is performed. At any time prior to initiating <b>an</b> <b>execution,</b> the player can select one of four categories of executions to perform upon weakened enemies; the selected type of execution determines the type of resource that will be granted when an enemy is executed. Upon completing a successful execution sequence, players are granted the type of execution that was selected. There are four perks available for players. One boosts the player's damage {{for a short period}} after the execution; one refills the player's Focus bar; one allows players to regain lost health, and the last significantly boosts the amount of experience points received from the kill. These experience points can be used to purchase upgrades for various attributes, such as health, damage, or Focus bar capacity, and to unlock additional execution moves. The game still automatically completes and finishes these execution sequences when players fail to press the highlighted buttons, but provides a much smaller reward. Lining up two or more weakened enemies in close proximity allows the player to perform a double execution sequence, which greatly increases the reward granted.|$|E

40|$|Context-aware {{applications}} provide end-users with enhanced experiences by continuously sensing {{their environment}} and adapting their behaviour {{to match the}} current context of use. However, developing true contextaware applications remains notoriously difficult due to the unpredictable nature of context changes. A context change may occur at any moment during <b>a</b> procedure <b>execution,</b> which may require <b>an</b> ongoing <b>execution</b> to be promptly interrupted {{in order to prevent}} the procedure from running in a wrong context. Currently, developers have to manually constrain <b>a</b> procedure <b>execution</b> to <b>a</b> particular context and take care of saving and restoring the execution state between context changes. Such manual approaches are error-prone and may lead to incorrect application behaviour. This paper presents a novel programming language model called interruptible context-dependent <b>executions,</b> where <b>a</b> procedure <b>execution</b> is always constrained to happen only under a specified context. In this model, <b>a</b> procedure <b>execution</b> can be seamlessly interrupted or resumed depending on the context. Additionally, the procedure execution state is automatically preserved between interruptions. We present the Flute language that supports interruptible context-dependent executions...|$|R

The fledgling is met by Ming-Xiao, who offers to form an alliance. Ming-Xiao reveals that she has the key, and LaCroix killed Grout to prevent his powerful insight from unveiling LaCroix's plans; Ming-Xiao changed into Nines at the mansion to frame him. Denying Ming-Xiao's claims, LaCroix rescinds the blood hunt on Nines and entrusts the fledgling with recruiting the Anarchs to punish the Kuei-Jin for murdering Grout. The fledgling finds Nines hiding in the forest, and they are then attacked by a werewolf and Nines is badly injured. The fledgling escapes with Jack, who reveals that LaCroix has issued <b>an</b> <b>execution</b> order on the fledgling for framing Nines on orders from Ming-Xiao.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} Henry's coronation, he arrested his father's two most unpopular ministers, Sir Richard Empson and Edmund Dudley. They {{were charged with}} high treason and were {{executed}} in 1510. Historian Ian Crofton has maintained that such executions would become Henry's primary tactic for dealing with those who stood in his way; the two executions were certainly not the last. Henry also returned to the public {{some of the money}} supposedly extorted by the two ministers. By contrast, Henry's view of the House of York â€“ potential rival claimants for the throne â€“ was more moderate than his father's had been. Several who had been imprisoned by his father, including the Marquess of Dorset, were pardoned. Others (most notably Edmund de la Pole) went unreconciled; de la Pole was eventually beheaded in 1513, <b>an</b> <b>execution</b> prompted by his brother Richard siding against the king.|$|E
5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire (and {{elsewhere}} in Central/Eastern Europe), women who killed their newborn could be {{liable to be}} placed in an open grave, and have a stake hammered into their heart. A detailed description of <b>an</b> <b>execution</b> in this manner comes from 17th century KoÅ¡ice (then in Hungary, now in eastern Slovakia). A woman to be executed for infanticide involved an executioner and two assistants to help him. First, a grave some one-and-a-half ell deep was dug. The woman was placed within it, her hands and feet secured by driving nails through them. The executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face. He then placed, and held vertically, a wooden stave at her heart to mark its location, while his assistants piled earth on the woman, keeping her head free of earth {{at the behest of the}} clerics, however, as to do otherwise would have quickened the death process. Once the earth had been piled upon her, the executioner grabbed with a pair of tongs a rod made of iron, which had been made red hot. He positioned the glowing iron rod beside the wooden stave, and as one of his assistants hammered the rod in, the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman's head. It is said that a scream was heard, and that the earth actually moved upwards for a moment, before all was over.|$|E
