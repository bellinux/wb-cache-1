5|$|Some {{aspects of}} the Brown {{decision}} are still debated. Notably, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, himself an African American, wrote in Missouri v. Jenkins (1995) that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least,</b> Brown I has been misunderstood by the courts.|$|E
5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought {{to have the opportunity to}} impeach malicious governors, but that would surely harm the governor, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least</b> (Russell 1938:179).|$|E
5|$|In any case, the {{succession}} of Nyuserre seems to have gone smoothly. A seal bearing both Nyuserre's and Menkauhor's names has been uncovered in the mortuary complex of Nyuserre's mother Khentkaus II. A further seal {{is believed to have}} both Nyuserre's and Djedkare's names on it, Djedkare Isesi being Nyuserre's second successor. Taken together these seals reveal that, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least,</b> Menkauhor and Djedkare did not perceive Nyuserre as an antagonist.|$|E

60|$|While the effigy of Eustacia was melting to nothing, and {{the fair}} woman herself was {{standing}} on Rainbarrow, her soul in an abyss of desolation seldom plumbed by one so young, Yeobright sat lonely at Blooms-End. He had fulfilled his word to Thomasin by sending off Fairway with the letter to his wife, and now waited with increased impatience for some sound or signal of her return. Were Eustacia still <b>at</b> Mistover <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least</b> he expected was that she would send him back a reply tonight by the same hand; though, to leave all to her inclination, he had cautioned Fairway not to ask for an answer. If one were handed to him he was to bring it immediately; if not, he was to go straight home without troubling to come round to Blooms-End again that night.|$|R
5000|$|Reformed theologian Meredith G. Kline {{known for}} {{advancing}} the framework interpretation of Genesis cites this book in his influential article [...] "Because It Had Not Rained" [...] after having reviewed it three years earlier, stating [...] "It is, indeed, informative and provocative.

[...] Kline also found Ramm's defense of the authority of scripture potentially inconsistent and Ramm's hermeneutical question regarding the place of natural revelation in interpreting scripture while a valid one, his approach in exploring and attempting to answer it done with too much zeal and dangerously close to being error-prone.|$|R
5|$|On the ground, the CIA and the Royal Lao Army had {{initially}} {{been given the}} responsibility of stopping, slowing, or, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least,</b> observing the enemy's infiltration effort.

The operation evolved into Operation Hardnose, in which CIA-backed Laotian irregular reconnaissance team operations took place.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most common {{objections}} to evolution dispute whether evolution can truly account for all the apparent complexity and order in the natural world. It is argued that evolution is too unlikely or otherwise lacking to account for various aspects of life, and therefore that an intelligence, such as God of the Abrahamic religions, must <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least</b> be appealed to for those specific features.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} Bede's story, and in {{particular}} of the miraculous nature of Cædmon's poetic inspiration, are not generally accepted by scholars as being entirely accurate, but there seems no good reason to doubt {{the existence of a}} poet named Cædmon. Bede's narrative has to be read {{in the context of the}} Christian belief in miracles, and it shows <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least</b> that Bede, an educated and intelligent man, believed Cædmon to be an important figure in the history of English intellectual and religious life.|$|E
40|$|The {{discriminant}} {{performance of}} a likelihood ratio based on a two-level multivariate model is examined on the speech of 60 male Japanese speakers using non-contemporaneous telephone recordings over uncontrolled channels. The performance is determined for both F-pattern centre frequencies and LPC cepstral coefficients, extracted from three very different phonetic segments only: a vowel, a voiceless fricative and a nasal. The Multivariate Likelihood Ratio is shown to perform well in discriminating same- from different–speaker pairs, yielding strength of evidence that can be characterised as moderate for F-pattern and, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>least,</b> <b>very</b> strong for <b>the</b> cepstrum. Comparison is made using the same data analysed with a so-called “independence ” or “Idiot’s Bayes ” LR approach, which ignores correlation between variables. It is shown that, as commonly found, the Idiot’s Bayes approach outperforms the MVLR. The consequences of this finding for forensic speaker identification are alluded to. 1...|$|R
5000|$|While Kevin is {{generally}} {{portrayed as a}} simple-minded and unsophisticated person, he is shown to exhibit remarkable astuteness in [...] "Fundraiser". It is Dwight, not him, who misunderstands the rules of silent auctions. Kevin comments this as Dwight being the “stupid guy” {{in the office and}} says that no one had borne this title before. He (apart from Ryan and a therapy dog named Kenny) also seems to be the only one to notice that Andy is suffering from a mental breakdown after his abrupt dismissal from Dunder Mifflin that he tries to conceal by unnatural cheerfulness and generosity. When Pam, Erin, and Jim reassure Andy that he would be all right, Kevin says that he would not be. Kevin also concludes that he feels like everyone he works with is an idiot. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of the episode, Kevin is revealed to have adopted a dog, Ruby. The way he describes Ruby's behavior makes his coworkers think that the dog is dead. In fact, Ruby is alive, albeit very old and feeble, or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>least,</b> <b>very</b> lazy.|$|R
40|$|A {{bird strike}} {{is defined as}} a {{collision}} between a bird and an aircraft. While most bird strikes cause little or no damage to the aircraft, some incidents can be fatal and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>least,</b> <b>very</b> costly. <b>The</b> majority of bird strikes occur during landing or take-off thus the focus of bird management is centered around the airport environments. The geographical features surrounding Sydney Airport include a number of bird-attracting water bodies: Botany Bay, Botany Wetlands, the Cooks River and Alexandra Canal. These features attract a diverse and abundant assemblage of migratory and coastal bird species including silver gulls (Larus novaehollandiae). Gulls {{are one of the most}} commonly struck species worldwide and at Sydney Airport silver gulls account for 43 % of all bird strikes. This poster presents information on the spatial and temporal movements of gulls in and around Sydney. It also outlines how the combination of a number of different management techniques have been designed to prevent bird strikes with this species and ultimately to improve air safety at Sydney Airport...|$|R

5|$|Broadly speaking, however, {{it appears}} that the ships were well-handled and commanded. Contemporary {{observers}} were surprised to note that the crewmen, despite lacking white officers, had complete control of their warships and were able to stay in good formation as they circled around the bay. The rebels favored firing over the city or around government-controlled military targets rather than outright destruction, something that Zachary Morgan believes was motivated by either humanitarian concerns or (<b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least)</b> pragmatism—by limiting the actual damage, they could gain support among legislators, the press, and general population. This has, however, caused a historiographical argument among scholars that persists to this day.|$|E
5|$|Consensus has {{determined}} sea turtles, including E. imbricata to be, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least,</b> threatened species {{because of their}} slow growth and maturity, and slow reproductive rates. Many adult turtles {{have been killed by}} humans, both accidentally and deliberately. Their existence is threatened due to pollution and loss of nesting areas because of coastal development. Biologist guess that the hawkbill population has declined 80 percent in the past hundred years. Human and animal encroachment threatens nesting sites, and small mammals dig up the eggs to eat. In the US Virgin Islands, mongooses raid hawksbill nests (along with those of other sea turtles, such as Dermochelys coriacea) right after they are laid.|$|E
50|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of the newer}} electronics is price. It can cost 3 to 5 times more per lamp to use electronic ballasts than traditional choke ballasts, which is why choke ballasts are still used {{in the majority of}} new tanning systems. Another {{disadvantage of}} the older style choke ballast is they are designed for European electricity, and require incoming voltage in the range of 220 V AC and 230 V AC. Most US homes have 240 V service and businesses use 208 V three-phase service that requires these beds to use a buck-boost transformer in order to receive the proper voltage. Too low a voltage will result in the lamp starter not letting the lamp ignite (or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>least,</b> <b>very</b> slowly) whereas too high a voltage can lead to premature failure in the starters and lamps. The average cost of these transformers is $200 to $250. While this makes the newer electronics cost about the same for the typical tanning bed, buckboost transformers are usually sold separately, so the total cost is not always obvious to <b>the</b> consumer <b>at</b> first glance.|$|R

5|$|Going {{into the}} final round of games, both teams were equal on points with Spain, with Scotland ahead thanks to a {{superior}} goal difference; however, Spain's final game at home to Iceland was scheduled to be played two weeks after Wales and Scotland had played each other. With this in mind, a draw for Scotland would be sufficient to virtually guarantee second place in Group 7 and advance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least</b> through to the two legged play-off against the winner of the Oceania qualifying tournament, while a win would likely see them top the group and qualify automatically. For Wales, anything less than a win would virtually end their hopes of qualification.|$|E
5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least,</b> they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, the Emperor {{received}} word {{that his father}} had died on 10 March 1826, and that he had succeeded his father on the Portuguese throne as King Dom PedroIV. Aware that a reunion of Brazil and Portugal would be unacceptable to the people of both nations, he hastily abdicated the crown of Portugal on 2 May in favor of his eldest daughter, who became Queen Dona MariaII. His abdication was conditional: Portugal was required to accept the Constitution which he had drafted and MariaII was to marry his brother Miguel. Regardless of the abdication, PedroI continued to act as an absentee king of Portugal and interceded in its diplomatic matters, as well as in internal affairs, such as making appointments. He found it difficult, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least,</b> to keep his position as Brazilian emperor separate from his obligations to protect his daughter's interests in Portugal.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least,</b> archaeological {{evidence}} supports the claim in the Weilüe and Book of Liang that Roman merchants {{were active in}} Southeast Asia, if not the claim of their embassies arriving in China through Jiaozhi, the Chinese-controlled province of northern Vietnam. Roman golden medallions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius and his adopted son Marcus Aurelius {{have been found in}} Oc Eo (near Ho Chi Minh City), a territory that belonged to the Kingdom of Funan bordering Jiaozhi. Suggestive of even earlier activity is a Republican-era Roman glass bowl unearthed from a Western Han tomb of Guangzhou (on the shores of the South China Sea) dated to the early 1st century BC, in addition to ancient Mediterranean goods found in Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The Greco-Roman geographer Ptolemy wrote in his Antonine-era Geography that beyond the Golden Chersonese (Malay Peninsula) was a port city called Kattigara discovered by a Greek sailor named Alexander, a site Ferdinand von Richthofen assumed was Chinese-controlled Hanoi, but given the {{archaeological evidence}} could have been Oc Eo. Roman coins have been found in China, but far less so than in India.|$|E
5|$|Data {{processing}} {{begins with}} indexing the reflections. This means identifying {{the dimensions of}} the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space. A byproduct of indexing is to determine the symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its space group. Some space groups can be eliminated from the beginning. For example, reflection symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules; thus, only 65 space groups of 230 possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. Indexing is generally accomplished using an autoindexing routine. Having assigned symmetry, the data is then integrated. This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of (<b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least)</b> records of the Miller index of each reflection, and an intensity for each reflection (at this state the file often also includes error estimates and measures of partiality (what part of a given reflection was recorded on that image)).|$|E

5|$|Opposite the entrance, {{and running}} across {{the middle of the}} court, was the great hall of the castle, with a grand porch and steps leading up to the first floor, where prestigious guests would have been entertained amongst carved wall-panels and murals.

5|$|A {{preponderance}} of historians favour {{the story that}} though the Victorious had sailed through the Lombok Strait rather than the Sunda, Britain had come off easily the best through {{a show of force}} during the Sunda Straits Crisis. Numerous accounts, including Gregory Fremont-Barnes' History of Counterinsurgency, are content with a simplified version that Indonesia closed the Strait for one reason or another, and that the arrival of the task force assembled around the aging carrier had intimidated Sukarno into reopening it. A common argument is that the passage was an effective and daring show of force, and often ignores the Sunda Strait issue altogether. This was a sentiment shown by the crew of the Victorious herself, who during their passage through the Lombok Strait went to action stations at the sight of an Indonesian submarine and prepared to fire on it if there was any sign of hostility, and believed that the Indonesians thought it wiser to hold back in fear of their power. This was not a view that the British official reports sought to dissuade, depicting the result as a compromise concession by the Indonesians, who had in brinksmanship terms, 'blinked first' after British refusal to back down. The Foreign Office even went to the extremity of claiming that the Lombok Strait was just as convenient for passage as the Sunda Strait, despite its far greater distance from Singapore and Australia. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least,</b> the subsequent Indonesian United Nations defeat and Abdul Rahman's agreement to avoid retaliation was a very positive result for Britain to take from the incident.|$|E
