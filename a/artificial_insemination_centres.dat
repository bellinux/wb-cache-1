In Bihar, breed replacement rate has been slow mainly due to collapse of Public <b>Artificial</b> <b>Insemination</b> <b>Centres.</b> A private organization namely Patna Animal Development Limited came into existence in mid-eighties but operating mainly around Patna in the field of. A. I and animal health. COMPFED is also providing AI and animal health services to members of Dairy Co-operative societies. BAIF and J. K. Trust are also operating in Bihar but in limited area. Despite Public and private efforts in A.

Hence, {{there is a need}} to revive the public <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>centres</b> and promote private organization to establish A. I. and animal health centres in Bihar. Quacks still dominate in the field of animal health in Bihar and some of them are providing emergency services to dairy farmers. A crash programme may be started to train some of quacks in animal health to enable them to provide scientific treatment within a short period of time. Dairy co-operative is only successful organization in Bihar but covers less than 15 percent of villages during 24 years. The dairy co-operative system has lost its steam in Bihar. Moreover, it should not be allowed to monopolize the milk marketing system. During survey, several farmers showed concern about low prices paid by co-operative. Milk marketing needs more emphasis but private milk processing and marketing organizations are not getting institutional support in Bihar which could be done by promoting private entrepreneurs through institutional financing and government support. Price of milch animal is higher in Bihar than most of major states in India. It is only due to unavailability of good quality animals. All the animal breeding farms established to multiply good quality breeds under public sector have already been closed. There is no any private organization engaged in multiplication of good quality breed of animals in Bihar. Hence, arrangement should be made in public-private partnership to establish animal breeding farms for the purpose so that the good quality breed of livestock (including goats) are made available to farmers at reasonable price. Goatry is a practiced mainly on landless and sub-marginal households in Bihar. Hence, the promotion of goatry will help improving socio-economic status of weaker section of societies. Hence, the marketing arrangement for replacement of breed and training of farmers should be developed for promoting goatry in Bihar. At first phase, all the existing <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>centres,</b> animal breeding farms, hospitals and dispensaries and extension system should be revived and arrangement should be made to utilize properly the fund allocated to Bihar under centrally sponsored programmes including Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In rabbits, {{the number}} of inseminated {{spermatozoa}} {{plays an important role}} in the fertility rate obtained after artificial insemination. However, methods for the correct determination of spermatozoa number are scarce. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a spectrophotometric method for the measurement of spermatozoa concentration corrected by the seminal particle/spermatozoa ratio. For this purpose 360 ejaculates were collected from 36 rabbit bucks. The semen samples were divided into three groups based on their particle/spermatozoa ratio subjectively determined by microscopic viewing. The spermatozoa concentration of each semen sample was evaluated by spectrophotometer and these results were compared with those obtained by using a haemotocytometer. The results of the standard spectrophotometric method were correlated with the results of the haemotocytometer count of spermatozoa (r= 0. 76; P< 0. 01). When the optical density was corrected by considering the P/S ratio, the correlation values greatly improved (r= 0. 94; P< 0. 01). The simplicity, rapidity and low cost of this method make it suitable for the routine measurement of spermatozoa concentration of heterospermic pools in rabbit <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>centres...</b>|$|E

By December 31 st, 2006, 13 765 individuals had been karyotyped in our laboratory, 62 % of these since 2002. Ninety percent were young purebred boars controlled be-fore service in <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>centres,</b> and 3 % were hypoprolific boars. So far, 102 con-stitutional structural chromosomal rearrangements (67 since 2002) have been described. Fifty-six were reciprocal translocations and 8 peri- or paracentric inversions. For {{the first time since}} the beginning of the programme and after more than 11 000 pigs had been karyotyped, one Robertsonian translocation was identified in 2005 and two others in 2006. The estimated preva-lence of balanced structural chromosomal rearrangements in a sample of more than 7700 young boars controlled before service was 0. 47 %. Twenty-one of the 67 rearrangements described since 2002 were identified in hypoprolific boars. All were reciprocal translocations. Twelve mosaics (XX/XY in 11 individuals, XY/XXY in one individual) were also diagnosed. Two cor-responded to hypoprolific boars, and three to intersexed animals. The results presented in this communication would justify an intensification of the chromosomal control of French and, on a broader scale, European and North-American pig populations...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundStructural {{chromosome}} abnormalities {{are well}} known as factors that reduce fertility rate in domestic pigs. According to large-scale national cytogenetic screening programs that are implemented in France, {{it is estimated that}} new chromosome abnormalities occur at a rate of 0. 5  % in fertility-unproven boars. ResultsThis work aimed at estimating the prevalence and consequences of chromosome abnormalities in commercial swine operations in Canada. We found pig carriers at a frequency of 1. 64  % (12 out of 732 boars). Carrier pigs consistently showed lower fertility values. The total number of piglets born for litters from carrier boars was between 4 and 46  % lower than the herd average. Similarly, carrier boars produced litters with a total number of piglets born alive that was between 6 and 28  % lower than the herd average. A total of 12 new structural chromosome abnormalities were identified. ConclusionsReproductive performance is significantly reduced in sires with chromosome abnormalities. The incidence of such abnormal sires appears relatively high in populations without routine cytogenetic screening such as observed for Canada in this study. Systematic cytogenetic screening of potential breeding boars would minimise the risk of carriers of chromosome aberrations entering <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>centres.</b> This would avoid the large negative effects on productivity for the commercial sow herds and reduce the risk of transmitting abnormalities to future generations in nucleus farms...|$|E

The objectives and principles of this monitoring programme were initially presented at the JRP meeting in 1997. More than 31, 000 pigs have been karyotyped since that date. Most of them were young purebred boars controlled before being used in <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>centres</b> (all breeds concerned). The annual number of karyotyped pigs has been stable since 2010 (around 1900 /year). Each individual is systematically subjected to GTG-banding to detect any chromosomal abnormality (at a 5 - 10 Mb resolution). During the last 20 years, 176 new constitutional structural chromosomal rearrangements {{have been identified in}} our laboratory (almost 9 /year on average). The most frequent ones have been reciprocal translocations (152, i. e. 87 %), inversions (18, i. e. 10 %) and Robertsonian translocations (4, i. e. 2 %). More than 20 cases of XX/XY chimaerism have been identified. Aneuploidies have mostly concerned the sex chromosomes, and the carriers were generally mosaics (especially XY/XYY). The overall prevalence of balanced constitutional structural chromosomal rearrangements is about 0. 5 %. This kind of rearrangement generally leads to severe reproductive defects (infertility, strong reduction of the litter size of the carriers and/or of their mates). Therefore, the chromosomal control programme carried out in France over thepast 20 years has prevented huge economic losses for the pig industry...|$|E

The research was aimed to detect {{the presence or absence}} of a genetic defect mainly CVM using SLC 35 A 3 gene and FXID using FXI gene in Indonesian Bali cattle. The presence of this genetic defect may have a significant economic impact on the breeding program. The research of genetic defect was done mostly in dairy cattle, but there was no report for screening of genetic defect in Bali cattle. In this study, 303 fresh blood samples and 22 semen samples which were collected from Indonesian Bali cattle breeding center (BPTU HMT Denpasar, BPT HMT Serading West Nusa Tenggara and district Barru South Sulawesi) and artificial insemination centre (BBIB Singosari and BIBD Baturiti) were used for screening of FXID and CVM. The amplicons of FXI gene were obtained by using PCR and that for SLC 35 A 3 gene were obtained by using PCR-RFLP method with PstI restriction enzyme. These PCR products were analyzed by using 2 % agarose gels electrophoresis. All genotypes were confirmed by DNA sequencing to determine an allele mutant.

Logistic regression technique was employed to estimate {{the probability of a}} particular breedable bovine female not being able to conceive of an artificial insemination. Wald statistic obtained for the independent variables indicated that the coefficients for the variables-species, lactation order, stage of lactation, milk yield, reproductive disorders, distance to artificial insemination centre and month of insemination were all significantly different from ? 0 ? at 1 degree of freedom. Positive values of ?R? statistic obtained for species, stage of lactation, reproductive disorder, distance to artificial insemination centre and month of insemination indicated that as these variables increase in value, the likelihood of conception increased by 7. 2795, 2. 7478, 2. 5638, 2. 7453 and 1. 9778, respectively. The negative ?R? in the case of average milk yield indicated that the likelihood of conception decreased by 0. 1973. Small values of ?R? for the statistically insignificant variables such as breed, farm size, land holding and lactation order indicated that these variables had got only smaller partial contributions to the model. Again, 1510 animals not conceived of AI were correctly predicted by the model not to have conceived. Similarly, 745 animals conceived were correctly predicted to have conceived.

BHV- 1 is associated with several clinical conditions, including infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, infectious pustular vulvovaginitis, balanoposthitis, conjunctivitis and generalized disease in newborn calves, causing great economic loss to the livestock industry. A total of 101 semen samples from breeding bulls of different <b>Artificial</b> <b>Insemination</b> <b>Centres</b> were screened for the presence of viral genome by employing PCR using two sets of primers viz., gB 1 /gB 2 and gC 1 / gC 2 from gB and gC genes coding for viral envelope. Viral DNA was extracted from semen using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit and was then subjected to PCR. In gB gene based PCR, 47 (46. 53 %) semen samples were found to be positive, producing an amplified PCR product of size 478 bp. While in gC gene based PCR, 43 (42. 57 %) were found to be positive for presence of viral genome, producing an amplified PCR product of size 173 bp. In comparison of the efficacy of the primers, the results of these two primers were in agreement for 95 samples out of the 101 tested samples. Thus, both the primers can be applied effectively in detection of BHV- 1 DNA in semen. In sequencing of gB-gene based PCR products, a consensus sequence of 459 bp was obtained. The sequences of field isolates matched completely with the sequence of BHV- 1. 1. Finally, the study revealed the presence of BHV- 1 in the semen of breeding bulls of Gujarat.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The porcine {{reproductive}} {{and respiratory}} syndrome (PRRS) is a devastating disease for the pig industry. In this study, we analysed the genetic variability of PRRS virus (PRRSV) {{as well as}} the relationship between the genetic variability, the geographical and temporal distribution of the PRRSV strains. Moreover, we investigated the association between the glycosylation patterns in PRRSV sequences and pigs growth. RESULTS: The data highlight that PRRSV strains evolve rapidly on individual farms, and temporal evolution of PRRSV is an important factor of genetic variability. Analysis of glycosylation sites in the glycoprotein 5 (GP 5) ectodomain revealed that PRRSV isolates had seven combinations of putative N-linked glycosylation sites of which the N 37 / 46 / 53 sites was found in 79 % of the sequences. No significant relationship was found between the genetic variation of the PRRSV strains and the geographic distance. A significant relationship was found between the genetic variation and time of sampling when farm was considered as a factor in the analysis. Furthermore, the commercial semen from <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>centres</b> was not a source of PRRS transmission. The PRRSV having the glycosylation site at position N 46 (N 46 +) were observed to have higher burden on pigs and accordingly the corresponding infected pigs had lower average daily gain (ADG) compared with those infected with PRRSV lacking the glycosylation at N 46 (N 46 -) position site. This study showed that the number of piglets by litter infected by PRRSV was lower for the Landrace breed than for the other studied breeds (Large White, Duroc and Pietrain). CONCLUSIONS: The PRRSV genetic variability which is determined by a local and temporal evolution at the farm level could be considered in a perspective of prevention. Moreover, the association between the PRRSV glycosylation patterns and its virulence could be of interest for vaccine development. The differences of resistance to PRRSV infections among pig breeds might open new horizons for the genetic selection of robustness against PRRSV infection...|$|E

The <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> industry concerns with BHV- 1 virus contamination of semen from healthy seropositive bulls with latent infections. Collection of semen from bulls maintained with a rigorous herd health program is an unlikely source of distribution of BHV- 1 virus. Virus from the lesions in infected bulls can contaminate semen and causes a hazard to <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> practices.

Such bulls can transmit the disease during breeding. Some female cattle can develop a latent infection that can be reactivated, and the disease can be transmitted to the male during breeding or in neonatal calves during late gestation or shortly after birth.

40|$|In mature male {{sheep and}} goats, changes in feed intake {{seem to have}} little effect on gonadal {{endocrine}} function but induce profound changes on sperm production. These outcomes are due to changes in size of the seminiferous tubules and in spermatogenic efficiency. Except with severe underfeeding, there are only minor changes in the endocrine function of the testis (testosterone production) unless season-long treatments are imposed. For cattle, nutrition clearly affects testicular development {{and the production of}} spermatozoa in young bulls, as it does in other species but, after the period of rapid growth has ended, there appears to be little or no response to nutrition. We are developing a clear picture of the metabolic signals, neuroendocrine processes and hormonal control systems that are involved, particularly for the mature male sheep. The energetic components of the diet, rather than protein, seem to be responsible, so we have envisaged a model of the relationship between energy balance and reproduction that has 4 'dimensions': genotype, structure (organs), communication (chemical and neural signals, nutrient sensing) and time (dynamics, metabolic memory, programming). We have linked these perspectives to 'resource allocation theory' and incorporated them into strategies for' clean, green and ethical animal production. In contrast to the clear outcomes with respect to spermatogenesis, the effects of nutrition on sexual behaviour are more difficult to define, perhaps because the behaviour is affected by a complex mix of physiological factors and because of flawed methods for quantifying male behaviour. For example, sexual behaviour is compromised by severe feed restriction, but male sexual behaviour requires intensive motor activity so a decline in libido could be caused by general weakness rather than specific nutritional limitations. The interaction between sexual activity and feeding behaviour also complicates the issue under field conditions. At {{the other end of the}} scale, overweight males can show reduced sexual success because they have difficulty courting and mounting. For this reason, exercise can enhance the fertilising capacity of rams. This will be important in extensive mating systems where males need to assemble and guard a harem and then mate many times for several weeks. For <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>centres,</b> there seems to be very few data on the nutritional management of males, but problems with overfed animals appear to be a risk. Future research should concentrate on the intra-testicular systems mediating the effects of nutrition on the production of spermatozoa...|$|E

From 1947, an <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> and breeding <b>centre</b> has been operating in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec for breeders clubs.|$|R
50|$|In 1826, the {{military}} remount depot moved premises which the stud {{had given to}} it; most stallions {{were taken from the}} stud to provide cavalry. On 28 May 1874, the Boscher Law enabled supervision of the allocations of the regiments and allowed to provide the stud with over 230 horses. On 28 June 1881, the municipal council decided to transfer the stud to adjoin the Route de Bayeux. Thus, the current stud farm buildings date from 1884 (the first stone was laid on 11 June 1884), and the transfer was finished three years later. During World War I, five mares out of six were requisitioned, but no stallions. Grooms fought at the front, and German prisoners dug a pond. In 1939, the old stable housed the staff of the Haras de Strasbourg (40 stallions and staff) {{at the time of the}} German breakthrough. Then, in 1944, fifty horses were killed by the bombing and other stallions were stolen by German soldiers in flight. The old stud was destroyed and claimed by the city. Thus, there only remains the street of the same name and the Normandy building which was previously the former riding school. The new stud was then built. General de Gaulle offered to the Sultan of Morocco Bois de Rose, a thoroughbred which had been stationed at the stud for two years. The stud then grew gradually in the field of reproduction, by investing in an <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>centre,</b> a centre for the freezing of semen and an embryo transfer unit. Thus, the electoral district of Saint-Lô has the highest density of breeding deposits of France.|$|R
40|$|Both for {{research}} and practical purposes, accurate and repeatable methods are required to assess the concentration of boar semen samples. Since the method which is used may influence the results considerably, {{the aim of the}} present study was to compare 5 frequently used techniques to determine boar semen concentration. Fifty ejaculates were collected from 37 different boars at an <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>centre.</b> Subsequently, each ejaculate was analyzed for sperm concentration by means of 2 different types of colorimeters (Colorimeter 1 : Model 252, Sherwood Scientific Ltd, Cambridge, UK; Colorimeter 2 : Ciba-Corning, Schippers, Bladel, The Netherlands), the Burker counting chamber (golden standard), and the Hamilton Thorne Analyzer (Ceros 42. 1) using 2 types of Leja chambers (the 'former' and the 'recently developed'). Each ejaculate was assessed 5 times with each of the 5 methods, and the repeatability, expressed by coefficient of variation (CV), was determined for each method. The different methods were compared using Pearson's correlations and limits of agreement. The colorimeters yielded the lowest CV's (both 3. 7 %), while the former Leja chamber resulted in the highest CV (12. 4 %). Moreover, significant (P 0. 71) were found between the results obtained by the different methods. The limits of agreement plots showed that none of the methods consistently over- or underestimated the sperm concentrations when compared to the Burker chamber, although there was a tendency toward higher over- or underestimation in highly concentrated sperm samples. Based on our results, there were no major differences in the assessment of sperm concentration between the evaluated methods. The choice of method used in a laboratory could therefore be based on factors such as cost, number of samples to be assessed and practical use, without thereby negatively affecting the validity of the results thus obtained...|$|R

An x-ray machine and two operation theaters for major and minor operations are also provided. For T. B. patients a special ward of 10 beds is attached. The district {{as a whole and}} Sakoli and Gondia tah.sils in particular has a large number of leprosy patients. With a view to checking this disease a leprosy subsidiary centre has been opened at Bhandara too. Bhandara has a maternity home and an ayurvedic dispensary also. Under the National Malaria Control Programme D. D. T. spraying is done periodically. The veterinary dispensary of the town with an <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>centre</b> attached to it is conducted by the municipality. The drainage system consists of stone lined surface drains kept in order by the sanitary staff. [...] "The water supply of the town is obtained from the Wainganga river. Three filtration wells have been sunk in the bed of the river and water is carried from them to a service reservoir near the jail, from which it is distributed over the town in pipes. The works were opened in 1900, the cost of the scheme being Rs. 1.84 lakhs and the annual maintenance charges Rs. 6,000. A large proportion of the cost was raised by local subscriptions, the zamindar of Kamtha, Indraraj Bhau, contributing Rs. 55,000 Provinces District Gazetteers, Bhandara District, 1908 ed., p. 192.. Although the water supply scheme was subsequently expended, the supply falls far short of the demand. A new scheme, to be undertaken on the same river, has therefore been submitted for Government approval. It is estimated to cost Rs. 11 lakhs." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} was aimed {{to evaluate the}} usefulness of hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) in revealing the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis due {{to the passage of}} young bulls from genetic rearing stations to <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> (AI) <b>centre</b> and the influence of this passage on hair testosterone concentrations (HTC). Hair samples on 33 yearling bulls were collected at the time of arrival (ST 1) to the AI centre and 3 more hair samples (ST 2, ST 3, ST 4) were collected at monthly intervals. After the end of quarantine each animal was submitted to the standard procedures for collection and production of semen. Overall HCC were significantly affected by period of collection (p. 05). The effect of breed was observed only for HTC that was higher in PRI than BS (p. 05). On the contrary, the effect of breed was evident. The results of this study replicated the effects of a major environmental stressor on mean cortisol concentrations assessed in hair, and add to the growing body of evidence that HCC is an effective and simply collected marker for long-term activity of the HPA system in response to persistent environmental challenge...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{performed}} on boar semen routinely used at the local <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> (AI) <b>centre.</b> The semen was stored in a Safe Cell Plus commercial extender at 17 °C for nine days. The aim of our research was focused on changes in sperm plasma membrane integrity. The integrity of the sperm plasma membrane and acrosome as well as sperm motility decreased after dilution and during storage of the semen. The highest percentage of live sperm was identified by the eosin-nigrosin method, a lower percentage by the SYBR- 14 /PI test, and the lowest percentage of live cells was discovered by the hypoosmotic swelling (HOS) test (P < 0. 01). There were {{significant differences between the}} results of staining methods and sperm motility (P < 0. 01). No {{significant differences were found between}} the HOS test results and sperm motility. The plasma membrane integrity parameters positively correlated (P < 0. 001) with each other and with sperm motility but negatively with aspartate aminotransferase activity. Our findings confirmed that the boar sperm aging changes, which increased during liquid semen preservation, were connected with the loss of function and integrity of the sperm plasma membrane. The employed complementary tests are comprehensive indicators of sperm membrane integrity during long-term semen preservation, and they can help establish the actual number of ‘healthy’ cells. The assays may be used in AI laboratories and should be incorporated into the routine of semen analysis...|$|R

40|$|In 1992, the porcine {{reproductive}} {{and respiratory}} syndrome virus (PRRSV) of European type (PRRSV-EU) {{was introduced in}} Denmark. By 1996, the virus had spread to approximately 25 % of the Danish herds. In January 1996, a modified-live vaccine based on the American type of the virus (PRRSV-US) was used in replacement boars for Danish <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> (AI) <b>centres</b> and from July 1996, the vaccine was used in PRRSV-EU infected herds for prevention of disease. Soon after vaccine introduction, PRRSV non-infected herds experienced outbreaks of disease due to infection with PRRSV-US. In this study, we investigated the risk factors (biosecurity level, animals, exposure from PRRSV-US-infected neighbour herds, semen, herd size, pig density and herd density) for infection with PRRSV-US in a cohort of 1071 sow herds; we used a nested case-control study. The retrospective observation period lasted from June 1996 (when they all were non-infected) to October 1997. Seventy-three non-vaccinated, closed sow herds became infected with the vaccine strain during this period. Each case herd was matched with two control herds from the cohort (controls had not been infected {{at the time of}} infection in the case herds). The data were analysed using a Cox-regression model. The hazard of infection increased significantly with exposure from PRRSV-US-infected neighbouring herds, purchase of animals from herds incubating PRRSV-US infection, increasing herd size and purchase of semen from boars at PRRSV-US-infected AI centres. The results are consistent with the modified-live vaccine strain spread to other herds by trade with animals and semen and by neighbour (area) transmission. We suggest that virus spread by aerosols was a frequent mode of transmission. LR: 20061115; PUBM: Print; JID: 8217463; 0 (Viral Vaccines); ppublishSource type: Electronic(1...|$|R
