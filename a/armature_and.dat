25|$|Csaky's work of {{this time}} is already {{distinguished}} by a Cubist understanding of volumetric and spatial relationships, with the integration of <b>armature</b> <b>and</b> open space, and the rhythmic use of geometry. Planes are faceted into abstract architectonic forms. His sculptural interpretation of Cubist painting is marked by elements employed in non-Western sculpture (Cycladic art, Oceanic art, the Art of ancient Egypt).|$|E
25|$|A railgun is {{a device}} that uses {{electromagnetic}} force to launch high velocity projectiles, {{by means of a}} sliding armature that is accelerated along a pair of conductive rails. It is typically constructed as a weapon and the projectile normally does not contain explosives, relying on the projectile's high speed to inflict damage. The railgun uses a pair of parallel conductors, or rails, along which a sliding armature is accelerated by the electromagnetic effects of a current that flows down one rail, into the <b>armature</b> <b>and</b> then back along the other rail. It is based on principles {{similar to those of the}} homopolar motor.|$|E
25|$|Philo T. Farnsworth {{was born}} August 19, 1906, {{the eldest of}} five {{children}} of Lewis Edwin Farnsworth and Serena Amanda Bastian, a Mormon couple then living in a small log cabin built by Lewis's father {{in a place called}} Indian Creek near Beaver, Utah. In 1918, the family moved to a relative's 240-acre ranch near Rigby, Idaho, where Lewis supplemented his farming income by hauling freight with his horse-drawn wagon. Philo was excited to find his new home was wired for electricity, with a Delco generator providing power for lighting and farm machinery. He was a quick student in mechanical and electrical technology, repairing the troublesome generator, and upon finding a burned out electric motor among some items discarded by the previous tenants, proceeding to rewind the <b>armature</b> <b>and</b> convert his mother's hand-powered washing machine into an electric-powered one. Philo developed an early interest in electronics after his first telephone conversation with an out-of-state relative and the discovery of a large cache of technology magazines in the attic of the family’s new home, and won a $25 first prize in a pulp-magazine contest for inventing a magnetized car lock. Farnsworth was Mormon.|$|E

As of November 2006, Wright still had remnant bits of machined metal left over from his BattleBots days strewn about the garage of his home. Wright was a former Robot Wars champion in the Berkeley-based robotics workshop, the Stupid Fun Club. One of Wright's bots, designed {{with the help of}} Wright's daughter, Cassidy, [...] "Kitty Puff Puff", fought against its opponents by sticking a roll of gauze onto its <b>armature</b> <b>and</b> circling around them, encapsulating them and denying them movement.

2500|$|A plasma railgun is {{a linear}} {{accelerator}} and a [...] plasma energy weapon which, like a projectile railgun, uses two long parallel electrodes to accelerate a [...] "sliding short" [...] armature. However, in a plasma railgun, the <b>armature</b> <b>and</b> ejected projectile consists of plasma, or hot, ionized, gas-like particles, {{instead of a}} solid slug of material. MARAUDER (Magnetically Accelerated Ring to Achieve Ultra-high Directed Energy and Radiation) is, or was, a United States Air Force Research Laboratory project concerning {{the development of a}} coaxial plasma railgun. It is one of several United States Government efforts to develop plasma-based projectiles.

2500|$|Remington had {{developed}} a sculptor's 360-degree sense of vision but until a chance remark by playwright Augustus Thomas in 1895, Remington had not yet conceived {{of himself as a}} sculptor and thought of it as a separate art for which he had no training or aptitude. With help from friend and sculptor Frederick Ruckstull, Remington constructed his first <b>armature</b> <b>and</b> clay model, a [...] "broncho buster" [...] where the horse is reared on its hind legs—technically a very challenging subject. [...] After several months, the novice sculptor overcame the difficulties and had a plaster cast made, then bronze copies, which were sold at Tiffany's. [...] Remington was ecstatic about his new line of work, and though critical response was mixed, some labelling it negatively as [...] "illustrated sculpture", it was a successful first effort earning him $6,000 over three years.|$|E
2500|$|Its {{construction}} {{was that of}} a triple-sized modern telephone. The hollow ear piece was made in such a form to focus the sound waves direct to the operator's ear. A thin metal diaphragm was secured to the opposite end, a pair of magnets with a pivoted armature was secured to the frame of the <b>armature,</b> <b>and</b> connected with the diaphragm by means of a strut, thus keeping the armature from contracting poles of the magnets, which were energized by a battery current. When the current was closed, the armature held the diaphragm in magnetic suspension. The slightest change in the current manifested upon the diaphragm and upon all those on the same line. It was decided best to move everything in connection with developing and manufacturing this project to House's shop in Bridgeport, [...] also taking Royal House (who was then over 70 years old) and his wife with them.|$|E
