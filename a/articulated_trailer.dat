50|$|The class P tram is a two-section high-floor {{articulated}} motor tram {{carried on}} two four-wheeled trucks, usually operating {{with a similar}} <b>articulated</b> <b>trailer</b> tram. The trams were built by Rathgeber between 1967 and 1969, and a two-car set carries 315 passengers, with 151 seated. , there are only six sets remaining, of which two are reserved for special services. The Class P tram was withdrawn in November 2014 for a short time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} the Mechanical Horse [...] tractor unit with an easily {{detached}} <b>articulated</b> <b>trailer</b> was conceived in the early 1930s by Napier & Son. The London and North Eastern Railway had approached Napier's, the quality car and aero-engine makers for {{an answer to the}} problem of replacing horses for local haulage purposes, while retaining the flexibility of changing the wagons and the manoeuvrability of the horse and wagon.|$|E

50|$|Trailer {{tracking}} is {{tracking the}} movements and position of an <b>articulated</b> vehicle's <b>trailer</b> unit, {{through the use}} of a location unit fitted to the trailer and a method of returning the position data via mobile communication network or geostationary satellite communications, for use through either PC- or web-based software.|$|R
50|$|After {{the decay}} of Hansa Wagonbau, since 1973 the Wegmann & Co. railcar company in Kassel {{continued}} the production of trams for Bremen. The principal structure of Bremish GT4 was kept, but the articulation was now controlled hydraulically. These types were called GT4d to GT4f, in all 61 items. The Bremish Wegmann articulated tram was also produced as a trailer (types GB4d to GB4f, in all 47 items). In that period, most trams in Bremen ran as trains of an articulated motorcar and an <b>articulated</b> <b>trailer.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Chipperfield's Circus Vehicles Set (GS23) {{was issued}} in September 1962 {{featuring}} all the Chipperfield's models released to date, and today {{this is one}} of the most desirable gift sets issued by the company. The Chipperfield's Circus Horse Transporter (1130) was released in October 1962 featuring the new Bedford TK tractor unit and an <b>articulated</b> <b>trailer</b> with models of circus horses, and in June 1964 the Bedford TK tractor unit was adapted with a large high-sided open top 'wooden' box as the Giraffe Transporter (503) complete with models of a mother and baby giraffe.|$|E
50|$|In summary, {{the study}} {{concluded}} that LHVs could not be operated in the UK without changes to infrastructure, developing dedicated routes, and changing certain speed limits. It concluded that, depending on the industry take-up, LHV usage {{could lead to a}} net increase CO2 emissions by effecting a modal shift from rail, although it revealed that LHVs would result in a net reduction of fatalities due to the overall reduction in vehicles on the roads, and would substantially reduce freight transport costs (although capital investment costs had not been accounted for). The report found there could be several benefits to allowing the extension of existing <b>articulated</b> <b>trailer</b> lengths, creating Longer Semi-Trailers (LSTs).|$|E
50|$|Canada's {{contribution}} is the LRC (Light, Rapid, Comfortable) train, built by Bombardier. This train is rather conventional, having separable carriages instead of <b>articulated</b> <b>trailers,</b> {{and can be}} intermingled with conventional non-tilt cars. In the United States, Amtrak experimented with the LRC in 1980, but retired it seven years later. In Canada, it entered service in 1981, and the carriages remain in use today, although the tilt mechanisms are being removed to reduce weight and maintenance costs. The LRC tilt-mechanism is power-assisted, driven by accelerometers. The ride quality is very smooth, even on relatively low-end tracks. Bombardier have since used updated versions of the LRC carriages for Amtrak's Acela Express, the third generation of tilting ICE, {{the new generation of}} fast British trains (Virgin Super Voyager) and the experimental JetTrain.|$|R
30|$|There are ten {{vehicle classes}} in Rwanda: car, jeep/ 4 wheel drive, pick-up, minibus, bus, 2 -axle truck, 3 -axle truck, <b>articulated</b> truck, <b>trailer</b> truck and motorcycle. Since it was {{necessary}} to collect representative data from all vehicle classes, a stratified random sampling technique was employed to survey vehicle operators, drivers and importers.|$|R
50|$|Trailer {{tracking}} is {{tracking the}} position of an <b>articulated</b> vehicle’s <b>trailer</b> unit through a tracking device fitted to the trailer. A communication network or satellite network is then used to transfer this positional data to a centralised collection point. Trailer tracking is used to increase productivity by optimising the use of trailer fleets.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{immediate}} post war era, several manufacturers {{who had previously}} been producing overtypes switched their focus to undertypes, attempting to compete with Sentinel. Among these companies were Clayton and Garrett. In 1922 Foden began producing the celebrated C-type overtype. It was not a revolutionary wagon, but had improvements such as a better driving position and the option of a windscreen. In 1923, Sentinel launched a much updated wagon, the [...] "Super" [...] Sentinel. In 1924, Fowler made their attempt to enter the undertype market. The various undertypes of the era were frequently fitted with windscreens to improve crew comfort.In the early 1920s, {{in an attempt to}} circumvent the weight regulations of the period and allow a higher capacity, several companies had experimented with the idea of an <b>articulated</b> <b>trailer.</b> With the brake and tyre technology of the era, such designs were often found to be difficult to control, with a propensity for jackknifing.In 1926, Garrett produced a rigid six wheeled wagon. Both Sentinel and Foden quickly brought out six wheelers, and these became {{a large percentage of the}} output of these manufacturers for the remainder of steam wagon production.|$|E
50|$|The Land Rover, {{which had}} been adapted as a 'Vote For Corgi' campaigning vehicle as a tie-in with the 1964 UK General Election, was re-issued in September 1965 in the red and blue colours of Chipperfield's as the Chipperfield's Circus Parade Vehicle (487) with a clown and {{chimpanzee}} replacing the political canvassers of the original, and a 'The Circus is Here' banner across the bonnet. The Chipperfield's Circus Menagerie Transporter (1139) which was released in October 1968 featured a new Scammell Handyman cab and a flatbed <b>articulated</b> <b>trailer</b> which carried a load of three clear plastic boxes designed to represent cages, each containing models of lions, bears and tigers. The Chipperfield's Circus Crane and Cage (1144), issued in April 1969, again featured the Scammell tractor unit but modified using the Holmes Wrecker platform with a large crane mounted on a pivoting base to the rear, and included another of the clear plastic animal cages with a model rhinoceros inside. The final model in the Chipperfield's Circus range was released in January 1970. The Chipperfield's Performing Poodles Pick Up (511) was an update of the earlier Kennel Club Wagon (itself an adaptation of the Chevrolet Impala first issued in 1960) and included model poodles and trainer.|$|E
5000|$|On the [...] "domestic" [...] scene, Seir Kieran {{went down}} to Kinnitty (1-19 to 3-8) and to Ballyskenagh (4-9 to 4-7) in the 1980 Senior Hurling Championship, and to St Rynagh's (4-16 to 2-7) in 1981. Even so, their {{contribution}} to the Faithful County's cause gave a tremendous boost to {{the profile of the}} club, and to its grip on the imagination of the rising generation in Clareen. The massive Bob O'Keeffe trophy came to the Seir Kieran National School in March 1981, along with Leinster Championship medal-holders Noel Bergin, Joe Mooney and Eugene Coughlan. Club chairman Tim Mulrooney, Offaly hurling secretary Tony Murphy, and Seamus Mulrooney were in attendance as well. There were even more ebullient scenes when Offaly recorded their famous All Ireland victory over Galway. On the Monday night, preceded by the Mountbolus Pipe Band, the new Champions had a rapturous reception into Emmett Square in Birr. The platform set up for the occasion was a converted <b>articulated</b> <b>trailer</b> provided by Frank Whitten of Clareen. Similar outpourings of pride and acclaim awaited the panel on its tour of the rural hurling strongholds. When they reached Mrs. May Bruce's post office just above the Clareen cross-roads, team captain Pádraig Horan handed the Liam MacCarthy Cup over to Eugene Coughlan, and in that manner the cavalcade arrived in Seir Kieran.|$|E

2500|$|The tilting {{carriages}} {{are based}} upon Bombardier's earlier LRC trains used on Via Rail rather than the TGV's non-tilting <b>articulated</b> <b>trailers.</b> Acela power cars and passenger cars are much heavier {{than those of the}} TGV {{in order to meet the}} FRA's crash standards. French and Canadian crews testing the Acela referred to it as [...] "the fast pig" [...] due to its weight. The extra weight leads to the Acela's power-to-weight ratio being about 22.4hp per tonne, compared to 30.8hp for a SNCF TGV Reseau trainset. The Tier II crash standards, adopted in 1999, have also resulted in the passenger cars being designed without steps and trapdoors, which means that the trainsets can only serve lines with high-level platforms such as the Northeast Corridor. Acela trains are semi-permanently coupled (but not articulated as in the TGV) and are referred to as trainsets. Bombardier later used the Acela carriage design and a diesel/gas turbine variant of the power car for its experimental JetTrain.|$|R
5000|$|It was the {{intention}} of the company to only repaint locomotives where existing paintwork was in poor condition. The paintwork on the Class 60 locomotives was still under warranty and most remained in triple grey livery and received a large body side logo and orange flashes next to the cab doors. However, June 1995 saw 60059 repainted in full Loadhaul livery and named [...] "Swinden Dalesman". Unveiled at the Hillhead Quarry exhibition, the repaint was part of a public relations exercise with Tilcon Roadstone. No shunters received Loadhaul livery despite being operated by the company. A small fleet of flat bed <b>articulated</b> lorry <b>trailers</b> received black livery with orange ends for steel movements from Rotherham Steel Terminal.|$|R
5000|$|The formet fleet {{consisted}} of 90 Adtranz standard-gauge light rail vehicle (LRV) manufactured by Walkers Limited of Australia. These trains were electric multiple units (EMU), which draw {{power from the}} underside of a third rail alongside the track. All cars in each train were powered. The trains were manned, with driver cabs occupying {{the ends of the}} train. The trainsets came in two configurations. The first and most common variation was the six-car trainset, which {{consisted of}} three sets of two EMUs (2+2+2) and occupied the maximum platform length of the stations. Each of the two EMU sets at the front and rear consisted of one driving car and one trailer car, while the two EMUs between were trailer cars. Each two EMU sets were not connected to other EMU sets in the train. [...] The second variation was a four-car trainset, a more obscure configuration that consists of only two EMU sets (2+2) of one driving car and one trailer car at both ends. These were only two-thirds the length and number of cars of the six-car variation. The 2+2 trainsets were used in full service until the widespread deployment of 2+2+2 trainsets. Each car had 3 bogies: 2 power bogies and one <b>articulated</b> <b>trailer</b> for the centre bogie. The end cars, numbered 1101 to 1260, have driver cabs. Middle cars numbered 2201 to 2230 have a concealed driver control panel, enabling the car to be moved around the depot independently. The train interiors were simple and basic. There were no individual seats, only longitudinal bench seating {{on either side of the}} train, surfaced in metal, while spaces near the connecting ends of the cars were provided for passengers who use wheelchairs and other assistive devices, with a large amount of floorspace for standing passengers. The rolling stock which has remained relatively unchanged since its introduction in 1996 were replaced by new trains from January 2015.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Screen Machine, now named [...] "Screen Machine 1", was {{a mobile}} cinema for the Highlands and Islands of Scotland launched in 1998. It consisted of an <b>articulated</b> unit, the <b>trailer</b> of which expanded and unfolded {{to provide a}} 102-seat self-contained cinema. In recent years, it stood in for Eden Court’s Riverside Theatre in Inverness whilst they were closed for a major refurbishment. The motivation behind the service was simple: to provide small and remote communities with access locally to {{the same level of}} cinema experience normally available in large towns.|$|R
5000|$|Like the HSR-350x, the KTX-II {{consists}} of two traction heads, that is the power cars at both ends, and an <b>articulated</b> set of <b>trailers</b> for passengers in-between; {{but the number of}} intermediate cars is eight, and no intermediate car is powered. Two sets can be coupled together with automatic couplers of the Scharfenberg type. The couplers and the surrounding structure form an integral unit, the so-called front ends, which were supplied by German industrial company Voith. [...] The vehicles received a new exterior front shape, designed by French design studio MBD Design. [...] The aerodynamic shape was inspired by the cherry salmon, an indigenous fish.|$|R
25|$|Models were well-proportioned {{and looked}} similar in style to {{contemporary}} Matchbox or Budgie Toys. For example, similar to Matchbox, the Land Rover (which {{came with a}} horse trailer) had windows, grey or black plastic wheels and a black base (see photo, Force 1988, p.47).The model in the photograph is a very poor example and any self respecting collector wouldn't have it on the shelf. Wheels, however, (the Land Rover had one on the bonnet {{as well as one}} underneath) were somewhat flatter and wider than those of Matchbox and their circumference was not ribbed at the beginning but this feature was added later. The baseplate, however, was pressed steel with etched lettering (not diecast with moulded lettering {{as was the case with}} Matchbox, Budgie Toys or Lone Star vehicles). Finally, the Land Rover had a trailer hook behind which was a cut, curved extension of the baseplate. The front and rear axles were held to the vehicle differently. The front was covered by the tube of the baseplate and held pinched on each side by extensions of the diecast body. The rear axle was exposed and run through holes in rounded sections folded over on each side of the plate.

50|$|Many of {{the cars}} offered 20 years ago are still offered today, but new models have also been released, {{including}} classic Bugattis and racing Mercedes-Benzes. The focus, however, is still on French Peugeots, Citroens, Renaults and older French makes including the likes of Panhard and Talbot. It is also interesting that Eligor offers several variations on the Dacia Logan, which, of course, is basically a Renault made in Romania. New and old models continue to be offered {{in a variety of}} detailed liveries. As time has passed Eligor resembles revered (but less sophisticated) Solido and Vitesse less and less and Brumm and Rio Models more and more.Into the new millennium, Eligor now offers a complete set of trucks and buses, mostly in 1:64 scale - about 30 different models are available in several hundred different liveries (Eligor Vintage 2003). One emphasis is on racing trucks and racing liveries (Kamaz and Renault) while standard <b>articulated</b> tractor <b>trailer</b> rigs seem a backbone. Mercedes, Freightliner, and Renault vans are also offered. DAF, MAN, Freightliner, Mercedes, Volvo, Kamaz, Renault, historic Sinpar and Hotchkiss, Iveco, and Scania are all represented. In this area, the company has built up its promotional offerings, especially with silk screening {{on the sides of the}} trucks - sort of becoming the French Winross. The Eligor website runs through more than 25 different liveries that have been produced for different (mostly European) companies.|$|R
50|$|The first project {{concept of}} trailer for public {{transport}} appeared in 1958. It {{was decided to}} manufacture buses of unified series Karosa SB (length 10 m), Škoda 706 RTO (11 m) and Škoda 706 RTO-K (<b>articulated,</b> 16 m), <b>trailer</b> Karosa B 50 and trailer NO 80. the prototype bus trailer was made {{at the end of}} the year 1960 and in January 1961 was introduced to the professional public, and then was put into trial operation. As the tractor could be used truck 706 RTTN or Tatra 137. The advantage of a personal trailer was a possibility it anytime disconnect and replace trailer cargo (such as import workers for the construction and then the material on the site). Prospectively, there was also the military option. But at the time of construction of the prototype developed Karosa new bus Š series, so that a unified series with mass production finally received only bus RTO.|$|R
50|$|There were a total 15 Dublo models, {{although}} with upgrades and modifications there are possibly up to 42 variations (not including box variations) manufactured (Force 1988, p. 47). All models came boxed. There were no colour changes throughout the short life of Dublo. Models were well-proportioned and looked similar in style to contemporary Matchbox or Budgie Toys. For example, similar to Matchbox, the Land Rover (which {{came with a}} horse trailer) had windows, grey or black plastic wheels and a black base (see photo, Force 1988, p. 47).

40|$|Retrofit {{introduction}} of contour marking for lorries. The Netherlands has an annual number of approximately 300 fatal or serious injury crashes involving lorries (rigid lorries, <b>articulated</b> lorries and <b>trailers).</b> European Commission CARE data indicates that in 2010 around 5000 people died on EU roads in crashes involving Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs), and 75 % of these fatalities were occupants of other vehicles. Road traffic crashes involving lorries {{tend to be}} more serious than other crashes because of the great size and mass of these vehicles. Part of these crashes are due to lateral and rear-end collisions at dusk or in the dark. Previous SWOV research has shown that contour marking on lorries can contribute to the prevention of these types of crashes. EU directive 2007 / 35 /EC states that from 10 July 2008, lorries with a minimum weight of 7. 5 tonnes and trailers from a maximum mass of 3. 5 tonnes must be fitted with contour marking that is approved and applied in the correct manner in order to pass the type approval test. From 10 July 2011, retroreflecting contour marking must not only be applied to new vehicle types, but also to older vehicle types that are licensed for the first time (European Union, 2007 a, 2007 b). The contour marking is not compulsory for existing vehicles that are already licensed. 3 M wants to know which substantive arguments can be put forward to plead for {{introduction of}} contour marking for the existing vehicle park in the Netherlands and the European Union, the so-called retrofit, and asked SWOV to investigate the issue. The 3 M request resulted in the following research questions: - What road safety effects can be expected as a result of retrofit application of contour marking on lorries in the Netherlands? - What are the social costs and benefits of this measure and is the measure socially cost-effective? - What are the costs and benefits for transport companies? - What is the effect of retrofit contour marking on the number of fatalities and seriously injured in the EU due to traffic crashes? Dutch and international literature were studied and a cost-benefit analysis was conducted to answer these questions. Based on Dutch and international research, it is estimated that in the present situation in the Netherlands, retrofit contour marking leads to an estimated maximum prevention of 3 fatalities, 16 serious road injuries and 481 crashes per year. This data is only valid for a situation in which none of the vehicles in the Dutch vehicle fleet would be fitted with contour marking and contour marking would be applied to all vehicles at the same time. This is not the actual situation and lorries are replaced when their service life has ended. In addition, due to previous European legislation, contour marking will already be applied to part of the vehicle fleet on 1 January 2015 (commencement date for the measure in our calculations). Statistics Netherlands (CBS) data indicates that the average lifespan of rigid lorries and of articulated lorries is 13 years, and of trailers the average lifespan is 22 years. Gradual implementation of contour marking would imply that the entire fleet of trailers would continue to drive without retrofit for approximately 11 years, and the entire fleet of rigid lorries and articulated lorries for approximately 6, 5 years. This data could be used to calculate the effect of implementing retrofit contour marking for all vehicles at once, if not for the fact that some lorries have already been fitted with contour marking. The fact that adaptations have already taken place, affects both the relevant fleet size (the share without retrofit) and the average lifespan of that share. There are various ways to include fleet changes in the calculation of the effect. The present calculations show that both factors (fleet size and lifespan) influence safety proportionally. Therefore, their effect on safety is the same, irrespective of, for example, fleet size or lifespan being half the size. If the above is taken into account, the total savings over the period during which the measure is being introduced (i. e. from 1 January 2015 until contour marking has been applied to all lorries) amounts to: • 8 fatalities; • 42 serious road injuries; • 1268 crashes. Chapter 2 discusses the reasons for possible over- or underestimates of these numbers. The costs of the retrofit introduction of contour marking for trucks in the Netherlands consist of the costs of the marking itself and the costs of applying the marking. The costs of applying the marking have been calculated for two different scenarios: a ‘maximum’ scenario in which full side contour markings are applied to the sides of all trucks, and a ‘minimum’ scenario in which only the bottom and the upper corners are marked, in accordance with the minimum requirements of the European Union...|$|R
