Hillenburg and Duffy met with various cartoonists—including James Kochalka, Hilary Barta, Graham Annable, Gregg Schigiel, and Jacob Chabot—to contribute to each issues. Retired horror comics writer and artist Stephen R. Bissette returned to write a special Halloween issue in 2012, with Tony Millionaire and Al Jaffee.

500|$|For me, in my {{mind the}} {{accomplishment}} is just that much sweeter. In terms of my ethnicity, always feeling like an outsider, always feeling different ... for me it's about saying, 'Thank you Lord, for giving me the faith to believe in myself when other people had written me off.' I've gone through enough of my life worrying <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing. I want to encourage anyone else out there who feels like maybe they can't overcome an obstacle, I feel like I'm living proof ... never lose your faith. I'm seriously a grateful individual right now.|$|E
500|$|Alejandro González Iñárritu was {{initially}} {{expected to be}} appointed as director, but film commitments later forced him {{to pull out of}} the project. Pizzolatto instead approached Cary Joji Fukunaga, who he knew from Anonymous Content, to take up the task. Fukunaga spent time conducting research with a homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police's Criminal Investigations Division in preparation for his services. Based on the officer's own personal experiences, the director was able to develop [...] "a nice sense of what it must be like to be a detective in Louisiana—especially in that time period in the '90s, which was pre-cell phone, and technology was about to change the way we all live our lives. That's what I did. I'm not a big serial killer studier—I've never analyzed books <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> stuff and I've never really watched procedurals. Those parts of the story were the least attractive to me; I was doing it mainly for the characters." ...|$|E

The video depicts Grey in various scenes ranging from {{on top of}} a skyscraper to {{in the middle of a}} busy street. The video has reached over three million views currently while only being accessible for one week. When asked about the video, Grey replied by saying “I wanted it to be Peter Parker by day meets Spiderman by night. An everyday kid, who isn’t really that cool but there’s something else going on, that people don’t know <b>about,</b> <b>That’s</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> the journey <b>that</b> I went on. I discovered that my insecurities and my flaws were things that I actually need to embrace, and I let them become my superpowers.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The next album, Modern Romans, was {{notable for}} its {{political}} content. Been later stated, [...] "There {{was a great}} deal happening politically - Grenada, Lebanon, or the government saying the Russians are evil and the Russian government probably saying the same <b>about</b> us. <b>That</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thinking inspired me to write the last lines of 'Walls Came Down'." ...|$|R

It’s practically already recording your voice, and it’s already recording what you’re typing and things like that, so, I’m not sure the objection of storing that information on a mobile device is valid.” [...]...|$|R

5000|$|The Smile Sessions: Archival {{recordings}} of the Beach Boys unfinished album Smile took nearly 45 years to compile for a dedicated release. Numerous complications contributed to its excessively protracted delay, including bandleader Brian Wilson's irrational fear of the album. Brother and bandmate Carl Wilson compared the album's structuring to editing a film, as compiler Alan Boyd explains, [...] "I think he was right <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> The <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> editing <b>that</b> the project required seemed more like the process of putting a film together than a pop record." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "Maniac" [...] {{was written}} by Josh Ramsay of Marianas Trench. Natalie Mejia {{explained}} the main concept behind the song saying, [...] "It is just <b>about</b> a love <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> drives you crazy. You know how love can be.

5000|$|When Clive James {{was asked}} by Charlie Rose in 1993 to name the three most famous people of the century, he cited Elvis Presley, Mohammed Ali, and Bruce Lee.

[...] Though the band since decided on the title of their fourth album, it continued to go unannounced, with various rumors circulating and the band stating on their website {{that it will be}} revealed [...] "all in due time" [...] and in Way's words, [...] "a special way this time.

"It {{is hardly}} fair {{to go back}} on bygones and talk like this," [...] he said, [...] "even if your {{position}} {{had something to do with}} it; only at first of course, you must remember that when we married mine was not without attractions. Two thousand a year to start on and a baronetcy and eight thousand a year in the near future were not--but I hate talking <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing. Why do you force me to it? Nobody could know that my uncle, who was so anxious that I should marry you, would marry himself at his age, and have a son and heir. It was not my fault, Honoria. Perhaps you would not have married me if you could have foreseen it." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the course}} of the morning there came from the officers, men, and {{passenger}} of the Dipsey a very cordial and pleasant message to Mr. Clewe and Mrs. Raleigh, congratulating them upon the happy event of which they had been informed. Sarah Block insisted on sending a supplementary message for herself, in which she was privately congratulatory to as great an extent as her husband would allow her to go, and which ended with a hope that if they lived to be married they would content themselves with doing their explorations on solid ground. She did not want to come back until she had seen the pole, but some of her ideas <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> travelling were getting to be a good deal more fixed than they had been.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{development}} of the whole northern portion of the prairie country depends {{on the success of}} the experiments that are being made," [...] Singleton went on. [...] "Their summers are hot but short; if they can get a grain that ripens early, they can cultivate vast stretches of land that are now, from economic reasons, uninhabitable, and it would make farming a more prosperous business in other tracts. Crops growing in the favored parts are occasionally frozen. It's a coincidence that a day or two ago I got a letter inquiring <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> wheat from a friend in Canada who is, as it happens, farming with a cousin of Lansing's." [...] Then he laughed. [...] "All this, however, {{has nothing to do with}} the object of your visit. Give me a few more minutes to think it over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, say, {{the first}} time I put my foot in the ring with a {{professional}} I {{was no more than}} a canned lobster. I dunno how it was--I seemed to lose heart.

Light-weights and all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> scrubs used to sign up with my manager and then walk up and tap me on the wrist and see me fall. The minute I seen the crowd and a lot of gents in evening clothes down in front, and seen a professional come inside the ropes, I got as weak as ginger-ale.|$|R
6000|$|But {{when the}} service was over Mary Isabel was dismayed {{to see that the}} sky had clouded over and looked very much like rain.

5000|$|Carl Wilson {{likened the}} {{assembly}} process to film editing, a view shared by Smile archivist Alan Boyd who stated: [...] "I {{think he was}} right <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> The <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> editing <b>that</b> the project required seemed more like the process of putting a film together than a pop record." [...] This fragmentary approach {{can be related to}} [...] "dangling clauses", a concept defined by David Bordwell thusly: [...] "An unresolved action is presented near the end of one section that is picked up and pushed further in a later section. Every scene will tend to contain unresolved issues that demand settling further along." [...] This results in ambiguity for when and where most Smile songs begin and end, as many of them lack clearly defined song structures.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wonder if I'll get {{a chance}} to use those things this winter," [...] he muttered. [...] "Little old New York doesn't know much <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> foot-gear.

I guess I'd be some tenderfoot all right, all right, on those things up in the woods. Good old Pat! Wonder what he's doing. It's a long time since I've heard from him. Well, I ought not to kick over a little extra grind! He's trying to get an {{education}} and support himself and help his folks at the same time. Wish he could come down here for the vacation. What fun it would be to show him around and listen to his remarks on the big city. It would be almost as much fun as going into the big woods in the winter. Fact is, I envy him right now, and I'll bet he doesn't envy me a penny's worth." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the last}} paper there was perhaps {{too much about}} mere debate; {{and there was nothing}} said at all <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> talk which is merely {{luminous}} and restful, a higher power of silence, the quiet of the evening shared by ruminating friends. There is something, aside from personal preference, to be alleged in support of this omission. Those who are no chimney-cornerers, who rejoice in the social thunderstorm, have a ground in reason for their choice. They get little rest indeed; but restfulness is a quality for cattle; the virtues are all active, life is alert, and it is in repose that men prepare themselves for evil. On the other hand, they are bruised into a knowledge of themselves and others; they have in a high degree the fencer's pleasure in dexterity displayed and proved; what they get they get upon life's terms, paying for it as they go; and once the talk is launched, they are assured of honest dealing from an adversary eager like themselves. The aboriginal man within us, the cave-dweller, still lusty as when he fought tooth and nail for roots and berries, scents this kind of equal battle from afar; it is like his old primaeval days upon the crags, a return to the sincerity of savage life from the comfortable fictions of the civilised. And if it be delightful to the Old Man, it is none the less profitable to his younger brother, the conscientious gentleman. I feel never quite sure of your urbane and smiling coteries; I fear they indulge a man's vanities in silence, suffer him to encroach, encourage him on to be an ass, and send him forth again, not merely contemned for the moment, but radically more contemptible than when he entered. But if I have a flushed, blustering fellow for my opposite, bent on carrying a point, my vanity is sure to have its ears rubbed, once at least, {{in the course of the}} debate. He will not spare me when we differ; he will not fear to demonstrate my folly to my face.|$|E

500|$|... "The Food Wife" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer of The Simpsons Matt Selman. The writing process began around September 2010. According to Selman, the episode mainly revolves around Homer and Marge competing about who is perceived as the most fun by Bart and Lisa, a situation that he thinks parents can identify with in real-life. The episode also focuses heavily on foodies and food blogs. Selman {{said in an interview}} with New York magazine's Grub Street publication that the foodie culture is [...] "just a world that I always thought was funny and fascinating. The idea of food as not only something you enjoy eating, but as something that you are so passionate <b>about</b> <b>that</b> you're <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> bragging <b>about</b> it. 'I'm the one who discovered this particular Korean pork-neck soup restaurant,' and you can <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> claim <b>that</b> as yours. The blogging just feeds into <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> territorial element <b>that</b> I always thought was inherently funny.
