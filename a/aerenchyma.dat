5|$|Diffusion {{of carbon}} dioxide and oxygen is {{approximately}} 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (<b>aerenchyma)</b> that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water.|$|E

50|$|Plant <b>aerenchyma</b> {{refers to}} the vessel-like {{transport}} tubes within the tissues of certain kinds of plants. Plants with arenchyma possess porous tissue that allows for direct travel of gases {{to and from the}} plant roots. Methane can travel directly up from the soil into the atmosphere using this transport system. The direct “shunt” created by the <b>aerenchyma</b> allows for methane to bypass oxidation by oxygen that is also transported by the plants to their roots.|$|E

50|$|<b>Aerenchyma</b> is a spongy {{tissue that}} forms spaces or air {{channels}} in the leaves, stems and roots of some plants, which allows exchange of gases between the shoot and the root. The channels of air-filled cavities (see image to right) provide a low-resistance internal pathway for {{the exchange of}} gases such as oxygen and ethylene between the plant above {{the water and the}} submerged tissues. <b>Aerenchyma</b> is also widespread in aquatic and wetland plants which must grow in hypoxic soils.|$|E
50|$|When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil {{microorganisms}} consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils {{is one of}} the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess <b>aerenchyma,</b> and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. <b>Aerenchyma</b> is a modification of the parenchyma.|$|E
50|$|The plants {{found in}} hydric soils often have <b>aerenchyma,</b> {{internal}} spaces in stems and rhizomes, that allow atmospheric oxygen {{to be transported}} to the rooting zone. Hence, many wetlands are dominated by plants with aerenchyma; common examples include cattails, sedges and water-lilies.|$|E
50|$|These {{plants are}} found in wetlands, {{particularly}} marshes, where they spread by means of thick rhizomes. Like many other marsh plants, they depend upon <b>aerenchyma</b> to transport oxygen to the rooting zone. They frequently occur on shorelines and floodplains where water levels fluctuate seasonally.|$|E
50|$|Hymenachne {{aquatic plants}} {{frequently}} found in marshes and other wet habitats. Their stems are spongy with <b>aerenchyma</b> tissue. The longest stems can reach 4 meters. They are perennial, sometimes with rhizomes. The leaves are linear or lance-shaped. The inflorescence {{is usually a}} cylindrical, spike-shaped panicle, rarely with branches.|$|E
50|$|Primary {{productivity}} fuels methane emissions both {{directly and}} indirectly. Plants not only provide {{much of the}} carbon needed for methane producing processes in wetlands, but in addition, methane can utilize three different pathways provided by primary productivity to reach the atmosphere: diffusion through the profile, plant <b>aerenchyma,</b> and ebullition.|$|E
50|$|Habitat: Wetland, fen, marsh, {{waterside}} pasture. along woodland streams, beside ponds, lakes, and rivers. Flowers visited include white umbellifers, Caltha, Euphorbia, Iris pseudacorus, Menyanthes, Mimulus guttatus, Potentilla erecta, Pyrus communis, Ranunculus, Sorbus aucuparia, Taraxacum, Viburnum opulus. The flight {{period is}} April to July.The larva is aquatic, associated with various aquatic plants, including Glyceria and Typha.The larvae tap the <b>aerenchyma</b> to gain their air supply.|$|E
5000|$|These [...] "breathing tubes" [...] {{typically}} reach {{heights of}} up to 30 cm, and in some species, over 3 m. The four types of pneumatophores are stilt or prop type, snorkel or peg type, knee type, and ribbon or plank type. Knee and ribbon types may be combined with buttress roots {{at the base of}} the tree. The roots also contain wide <b>aerenchyma</b> to facilitate transport within the plants.|$|E
5000|$|These {{plants are}} very simple, lacking an obvious stem or leaves. The {{greater part of}} each plant is a small {{organized}} [...] "thallus" [...] or [...] "frond" [...] structure only a few cells thick, often with air pockets (<b>aerenchyma)</b> that allow it to float on or just under the water surface. Depending on the species, each plant may have no root or may have one or more simple rootlets.|$|E
50|$|Aquatic {{plants are}} plants that {{have adapted to}} living in aquatic environments (saltwater or freshwater). They are also {{referred}} to as hydrophytes or macrophytes. These plants require special adaptations for living submerged in water, or at the water's surface. The most common adaptation is <b>aerenchyma,</b> but floating leaves and finely dissected leaves are also common. Aquatic plants can only grow in water or in soil that is permanently saturated with water. They are therefore a common component of wetlands.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} {{dissolved}} oxygen {{in a water}} body is frequently the key substance in determining the extent and kinds of organic life in the water body. Fish need dissolved oxygen to survive, although their tolerance to low oxygen varies among species; in extreme cases of low oxygen some fish even resort to air gulping. Plants often have to produce <b>aerenchyma,</b> while the shape and size of leaves may also be altered. Conversely, oxygen is fatal to many kinds of anaerobic bacteria.|$|E
50|$|The large air-filled {{cavities}} {{provide a}} low-resistance internal pathway for {{the exchange of}} gases between the plant organs above {{the water and the}} submerged tissues. This allows plants to grow without incurring the metabolic costs of anaerobic respiration. Some of the oxygen transported through the <b>aerenchyma</b> leaks through root pores into the surrounding soil. The resulting small rhizosphere of oxygenated soil around individual roots support microorganisms that prevent the influx of potentially toxic soil components such as sulfide, iron, and manganese.|$|E
50|$|Parenchyma (para - 'beside'; chyma - 'in filling, loose, unpacked') is {{the bulk}} of a substance. In plants, it {{consists}} of relatively unspecialised living cells with thin cell walls that are usually loosely packed so that intercellular spaces are found between cells of this tissue. This tissue provides support to plants and also stores food. In some situations, a parenchyma contains chlorophyll and performs photosynthesis, in which case it is called a chlorenchyma. In aquatic plants, large air cavities are present in parenchyma to give support to them to float on water. Such a parenchyma type is called <b>aerenchyma.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Sparganium, {{commonly}} known as the bur-reed, is a genus of aquatic plants of shallow marshes, ponds and streams. There are 9 species found in the United States and Canada. The stem, which may be floating or emergent, emerges from a buried rhizome, which like many wetland plants, is dependent upon <b>aerenchyma</b> to transport oxygen to the rooting zone. The leaves are strap-like. The flowers are borne in spherical heads, which bear either male or female flowers. [...] The seeds may accumulate in the soil as dense seed banks, which allow the plants to regenerate during low water periods.|$|E
5000|$|Coquillettidia perturbans {{lay their}} eggs {{in the form of}} an egg raft in a marsh or swamp habitat. This raft usually {{contains}} around 100 eggs, which generally hatch after several days depending on the temperature of the environment. The larvae and pupae are adapted with an abdominal segment capable of piercing the inner gaseous tissue of the aquatic plant life, or <b>aerenchyma,</b> located within this environment, such as cattails (Typha latifolia) and Juncus sp. [...] This piercing allows access to the root epidermal cell layer of the plant, or the <b>aerenchyma,</b> in order to breathe, allowing the larvae and pupae to complete atmospheric oxygen uptake exclusive of the risk of being located near the surface of the water, as to avoid predators and insecticides. C. perturbans complete four aquatic larval instars while pupal development ranges from a few hours to a few weeks depending on the climate present. If the climate consists of cold weather, this could lengthen the larval period several months. The pupal stage can range from a few hours to several weeks, depending on the climate of the environment. Approximately twenty-four hours after the adult is released from the pupal case, the wings have completed the hardening process and are fully expanded, enabling it to fly. The life cycle takes around seven to sixteen days to complete, and the C. perturbans can live up to five or six months if the hibernation stage takes place.|$|E
50|$|The biotic {{characteristics}} are mainly {{determined by the}} organisms that occur. For example, wetland plants may produce dense canopies that cover large areas of sediment—or snails or geese may graze the vegetation leaving large mud flats. Aquatic environments have relatively low oxygen levels, forcing adaptation by the organisms found there. For example, many wetland plants must produce <b>aerenchyma</b> to carry oxygen to roots. Other biotic {{characteristics are}} more subtle and difficult to measure, such as {{the relative importance of}} competition, mutualism or predation. There are a growing number of cases where predation by coastal herbivores including snails, geese and mammals appears to be a dominant biotic factor.|$|E
50|$|The larvae are aquatic {{and live}} {{their entire lives}} in the rhizosphere. They are white and grow up to 1 cm long at 4th instar stage. The larvae survive in the anoxic zone by using {{modified}} spiracles that are shaped as dorsal hooks connected to the tracheal system. These hooks are penetrate into the <b>aerenchyma</b> cells of rice plants and other wetland grasses for respiration. The larvae go through 4 instars (or stadia) and complete development in about 28-35 days. The pupae is a small silk cocoon encased in mud (0.5-0.9 cm long) and attached to the roots. The pupal stage takes around 7 days to complete.|$|E
50|$|The species grows as an {{emergent}} plant, that is, in flooded conditions, so {{the plant}} is generally dependent upon <b>aerenchyma</b> in the stem to carry oxygen into the roots. Its metabolism, is, however, also tolerant of low soil oxygen. It is often found in areas where water levels fluctuate naturally, with spring flooding and later summer emergence. Apart from flooding, the species is also influenced by soil fertility, tending {{to grow in the}} more fertile bays of large lakes, for example. Like many aquatic plants, it is negatively affected by salinity and grazing. It is also negatively affected by competition from other wetland plants. Like many wetland plants, it can survive unfavorable conditions as buried seeds in the soil.|$|E
50|$|Waterlogging {{reduces the}} supply of oxygen to the roots and can kill a plant within days. Plants cannot avoid waterlogging, but many species {{overcome}} the lack of oxygen in the soil by transporting oxygen to the root from tissues that are not submerged. Species that are tolerant of waterlogging develop specialised roots near the soil surface and <b>aerenchyma</b> to allow the diffusion of oxygen from the shoot to the root. Roots that are not killed outright may also switch to less oxygen-hungry forms of cellular respiration. Species that are frequently submerged have evolved more elaborate mechanisms that maintain root oxygen levels, perhaps most notable being the dramatic aerial roots seen in Mangrove forests.|$|E
50|$|This {{plant was}} {{formerly}} included in genus Scirpus. It {{is native to}} western North America, including the western Canadian provinces and the northwestern United States, as well as southern South America. It grows in wet and seasonally wet habitat, often on saline and alkaline soils. It is a perennial herb growing from a small, hard rhizome. The erect stems are stiff, ridged, and cylindrical, not three-angled. It lacks <b>aerenchyma,</b> a trait which makes it different from many of its relatives. The stems are sheathed by tough long leaves. The inflorescence is a headlike cluster of a few cone-shaped spikelets accompanied by a long, stiff bract which looks like {{an extension of the}} stem.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Aerenchyma</b> (white spongy air-conducting {{tissue that}} gives stems buoyancy) forms on stems {{floating}} in water, {{but does not}} form on stems growing on land. Plants typically grow {{to as much as}} 6" [...] tall, but stems will spread in the water to 3-5' long. Stems are clad with bi-pinnate, fine, mimosa-like sensitive leaves that close up when touched. Primary leaf segments have 8-40 small oblong leaflets arranged in opposite pairs. Tiny greenish-yellow flowers are densely crowded into feathery orbicular inflorescences that bloom in summer. Fruits are flat pods (to 1-2" [...] long). Floating aquatic plant stems often form thick foliage mats and is considered to be an invasive aquatic weed in some tropical waters where large mats may form that choke waterways, resulting in restricted water flow, reduced water quality, reduced fish activity and loss of some underwater and native wetland plants.|$|E
50|$|Adults overwinter in {{leaf litter}} near purple loosestrife plants. They {{emerge in the}} spring and start to feed on the young growth. They cause damage to the leaves characterised by neat rounded shot holes between the veins. The females lay up to 500 eggs from May to July in small batches on leaves and stems. On hatching, the first instar larvae feed on growing shoot tips and may kill them. Later instars feed on stems and leaves leaving the upper cuticle of the leaf intact. When the density of the larvae is high enough, the plant can be {{completely}} defoliated. After feeding for about three weeks and undergoing further moults, the larvae move down the plant to pupate in the soil or leaf litter. If the water level is high, larvae sometimes pupate in the hollow <b>aerenchyma</b> tissue in the plant stems. Both adults and larvae can float and may be wafted by water currents or wind to new host plants.|$|E
50|$|Limnobium laevigatum is a {{floating}} aquatic plant, {{which can be}} mistaken for Water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) due to their superficial similarity. Juvenile plants grow in rosettes of floating leaves that lie prostrate upon the water surface, a distinguishing character of the juvenile plant {{is the presence of}} spongy <b>aerenchyma</b> tissue upon the abaxial surface (underside) of the leaf. Mature plants grow up to 50 cm tall, and have emergent leaves borne on petioles that are not swollen or inflated like the spongy leaf stalks of water hyacinth, which aid in buoyancy. Spongeplant produces stolons which bear rametes. Flowers are small, white, and unisexual. Female flowers have an inferior ovary, the fruit is a fleshy capsule 4-13 mm long and 2-5 mm in diameter, and seeds are 1 mm long, ellipsoid, and hairy. Limnobium laevigatum, or Smooth Frogbit can be distinguished from Limnobium spongia, American frogbit, by flower and leaf characteristics as well as range; American frogbit is not known to occur in western states unlike smooth frogbit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{array of}} floral and faunal fossils {{found in the}} Princeton Chert has offered unequivocal {{evidence}} {{that it was a}} lacustrine or lake environment. The plant fossils found show many structural and anatomical adaptations to an aquatic environment, including a reduced vascular system, <b>aerenchyma</b> in tissues (air spaces to provide buoyancy), and protoxylem lacunae surrounded by a ring of cells with thickened inner walls. [...] Further evidence is provided by the fossils’ clear affinities with modern aquatic angiosperms. Many extant plants show these adaptations and are similar to the organisms found in the chert. For example, water lilies (Allenbya, Nymphaeaceae), water plantains (Alismataceae), arums (Keratosperma, Araceae) and rushes and sedges (Ethela, Juncaceae/Cyperaceae) {{are just some of the}} angiosperms found both today and in the Princeton Chert. Seeds have also been found which share adaptations with living aquatics. On the other hand, terrestrial fossils have rarely been found. The few that are, are represented mainly by seeds, some of which may have been transported by birds.|$|E
50|$|This {{aquatic plant}} grows {{in shallow water}} and wetlands, with {{its roots in the}} {{sediment}} and its leaves floating on the water surface; it can grow in water up to 5 metres deep. It is usually found in shallower water than the white water lily, and often in beaver ponds. Since the flooded soils are deficient in oxygen, <b>aerenchyma</b> in the leaves and rhizome transport oxygen to the rhizome. Often there is mass flow from the young leaves into the rhizome, and out through the older leaves. The rhizomes are often consumed by muskrats. The flower is solitary, terminal, held above the water surface; it is hermaphrodite, 2-4 cm diameter, with five or six large bright yellow sepals and numerous small yellow petals largely concealed by the sepals. Flowering is from June to September, and pollination is entomophilous, by flies attracted to the alcoholic scent. The flower is followed by a green bottle-shaped fruit, containing numerous seeds which are dispersed by water currents. The species is less tolerant of water pollution than water-lilies in the genus Nymphaea.|$|E
50|$|Carex aquatilis is {{a species}} of sedge known by the common names water sedge and leafy tussock sedge. It has a circumboreal distribution, {{occurring}} throughout the northern reaches of the Northern Hemisphere. It grows in many types of mountainous and Arctic habitat, including temperate coniferous forest, alpine meadows, tundra, and wetlands. There are several varieties of this species, and it is somewhat variable in appearance. It produces triangular stems reaching heights between 20 centimeters and 1.5 meters, and generally does not form clumps as some other sedges do. It grows from a dense rhizome network which produces a mat of fine roots thick enough to form sod, and includes <b>aerenchyma</b> to allow the plant to survive in low-oxygen substrates like heavy mud. The inflorescence bears a number of spikes with one leaflike bract at the base which is longer than the inflorescence itself. The fruits are glossy achenes, and although the plant occasionally reproduces by seed, {{most of the time}} it reproduces vegetatively, spreading via its rhizome. In fact, in any given year, most shoots produce no flowers. This perennial plant lives up to 10 years or more, can form peat as its rhizome system decomposes, and is sometimes used to revegetate areas where peat has been harvested.|$|E
5000|$|Marshes {{provide a}} habitat for {{many species of}} plants, animals, and insects that have adapted to living in flooded conditions. The plants {{must be able to}} survive in wet mud with low oxygen levels. Many of these plants {{therefore}} have <b>aerenchyma,</b> channels within the stem that allow air to move from the leaves into the rooting zone. Marsh plants also tend to have rhizomes for underground storage and reproduction. Familiar examples include cattails, sedges, papyrus and sawgrass. Aquatic animals, from fish to salamanders, are generally able to live with a low amount of oxygen in the water. Some can obtain oxygen from the air instead, while others can live indefinitely in conditions of low oxygen. Marshes provide habitats for many kinds of invertebrates, fish, amphibians, waterfowl and aquatic mammals. Marshes have extremely high levels of biological production, some of the highest in the world, and therefore are important in supporting fisheries. [...] Marshes also improve water quality by acting as a sink to filter pollutants and sediment from the water that flows through them. Marshes (and other wetlands) are able to absorb water during periods of heavy rainfall and slowly release it into waterways and therefore reduce the magnitude of flooding. The pH in marshes tends to be neutral to alkaline, as opposed to bogs, where peat accumulates under more acid conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Wetland {{conditions}} such as shallow water, high plant productivity, and anaerobic substrates provide a suitable environment for important physical, biological, and chemical processes. Because of these processes, wetlands {{play a vital role}} in global nutrient and element cycles. Cronk & Fennessy (2001) Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2 mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots.

40|$|The {{anatomy and}} {{construction}} of the <b>aerenchyma</b> of two different rice cultivars that differed in gas transport capacity through the <b>aerenchyma</b> was studied by scanning electron microscopy {{in different parts of}} the rice plants (root, root-shoot transition, leaf sheath, leaf blade, and stem), with special emphasis to limitations of gas transport within the plant and gas exchange between the <b>aerenchyma</b> and the soil or the <b>aerenchyma</b> and the atmosphere. Differences in the construction or aerial extend of the <b>aerenchyma</b> between the tow cultivars were not observed. Measurements of CH 4 -concentrations within the <b>aerenchyma</b> of the leaf sheaths and the internodes of the stem, as well as of the aerial extend of the <b>aerenchyma</b> indicate that CH 4 is released from rice <b>aerenchyma</b> to the atmosphere mainly via the leaf sheet.
