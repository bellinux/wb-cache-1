40|$|AbstractRepeated {{trafficking}} and harvesting operations lead {{to high levels}} of compaction in inter-row wheelings used in asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) production. This reduces soil porosity and infiltration resulting in water ponding on the soil surface. Even on gently sloping land this can result in runoff generation and an increased risk of soil erosion. A winged tine (WT) is currently used by a leading <b>asparagus</b> <b>grower</b> to loosen compacted inter-row wheelings. In order to test the effectiveness of this tine for alleviating compaction and implications for runoff and soil erosion control, it was evaluated alongside several other tine configurations. These were a narrow tine (NT); a narrow tine with two shallow leading tines (NSLT); a winged tine with two shallow leading tines (WSLT); and a modified para-plough (MPP). Testing was conducted under controlled conditions on a sandy loam soil in the Soil Management Facility at Cranfield University, Bedfordshire, UK. Tine performance was assessed at 3 depths (175, 250 and 300 mm) by draught force; soil disturbance (both above and below ground); specific draught for a given level of soil disturbance; surface roughness; and estimated change in soil bulk density. The effectiveness of tines for compaction alleviation and potential for mitigating runoff and soil erosion varied with depth. The most effective tines were found to be the MPP NSLT and the WSLT at 175 mm, 250 mm and 300 mm depth, respectively...|$|E

These insects feed on the young and tender asparagus shoots and render them worthless for the market. Later broods devour the foliage and frequently kill the plants. This bulletin gives brief descriptions of the various stages of these pests, tells how they live and work, and gives suggestions for controlling them. Of remedial measures the best for general use is shown to be spraying with arsenate of lead directions for the preparation and application of which are given on pages 10 - 11. " [...] p. ...|$|R

As implementation of IPM measures and strategies has a high perceived risk, demonstration of and discussion on possibilities may be {{a key element in}} reducing the risk perception. Together with Dutch <b>asparagus</b> <b>growers</b> and chain partners, WUR and Aceera initiated a grower’s network to examine and discuss pest status and possible risk of a number of insect pests in asparagus, and possible IPM solutions. Such networks are a Dutch government initiative, aiming at improved knowledge transfer from (applied) science to several crop sectors. In the asparagus network insect pest species were determined; pest status was estimated, simultaneously assessing the growers´ knowledge of the species. Subsequently a species specific approach was formulated and tested. Control strategy of the asparagus fly (Plioreocepta poeciloptera Schrank) was focused on a monitoring system, which was developed and validated by Applied Plant Research in 2012 - 2015. The presence and population pressure of the flies was determined in cooperation with farmers based on sticky trap catches. The asparagus beetle (Crioceris asparagi Linnaeus) was mainly controlled by all kinds of mechanical technics and natural enemies. This publication presents the outcome of this network with the new goals of the EU as background, that make implementation of new control methods necessary...|$|R
