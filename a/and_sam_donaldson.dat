50|$|As {{the shuttle}} program {{expanded}} {{in the early}} 1980s, NASA began a Space Flight Participant program to allow citizens without scientific or governmental roles to fly.

5000|$|The {{documentary}} Framing an Execution: The Media & Mumia Abu-Jamal {{looks at}} the way <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson</b> from the ABC program 20/20 covered the case.

This case only got recognition after people continued to dispute that Mumia's trial was fair or lawful, {{to the extent that it}} reached national and international attention. 20/20 begins to tell this case as an emotional story, making people see it as if it isn't that important. <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson</b> starts his interviewing with the widow, Maureen Faulkner. She is seen as a damsel in distress, which makes it easier to sympathize with her. From the beginning we know the specific angle of ABC News and where the bias of <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson</b> comes from.
