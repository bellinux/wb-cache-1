5|$|The raven-bears, a new heraldic beast which {{combined}} several {{creatures that}} are important to aboriginal symbolism, were proposed by the heralds in honour of the United Nations' International Year of the World's Indigenous Peoples, also occurring in 1993. The raven-bears <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> an outcrop of {{what is known as the}} Canadian Shield, a geological formation which the authority foundation is based on. The Canadian Shield is formed by rocks, which are covered in red coloured maple leaves and by golden maple seeds. The motto that was chosen is Latin for Let us honour those who honour our country.|$|E
5|$|Alex convinces Principal Skinner {{to have a}} school-dance {{rather than}} the regular yearly event of apple picking. Skinner agrees, so Alex and Lisa, {{accompanied}} by Sherri, Terri, Janey and Allison visit the mall to purchase party supplies, but the girls detour and begin trying on outfits for the dance, despite Lisa's protests. The group leave the mall, none speaking to each other. Lisa decides not to attend the dance, but changes her mind {{and goes to the}} school to take tickets at the door, but later arrives and discovers the boys and girls <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> different sides of the room, and explains to Alex that it is like this because they are only children, not adults.|$|E
5|$|The Spirit of Fire {{releases}} the new Halo, but faces immediate resistance upon {{it from the}} Banished. Back on the Ark, Alice-130 and Douglas-042 destroy enemy barricades and prevent reinforcements, including Atriox, from reaching the Halo; they then use the portal network to reach the Halo themselves. There, Professor Anders is escorted to the ring’s control room, where the firing system of the structure is deactivated and a signal beacon is set. Meanwhile, the Spirit of Fires forces are locked in a struggle with {{the remnants of the}} Banished. Anders finds the gravity controls for the Halo and uses them to raise the land that the remaining Banished <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> into space where it disintegrates. The ground forces return to the Spirit of Fire, but Anders and the Halo enter slipspace as they cannot halt the jump's countdown. Before the Halo jumps, Anders promises to get help from the UNSC as soon as possible. On the Ark, Atriox and a legion of Banished still live, preparing for the next fight against the UNSC. Meanwhile, the Halo carrying Anders drops out of slipspace prematurely, only to encounter a Foreunner construct known as a Guardian.|$|E

25|$|The {{recombinant}} {{building is}} a lesson in engineering and architecture. Thirty thousand square feet of studios and seminar spaces, a workshop, a thesis pit and a bridge to the library have been stacked, cantilevered and suspended to form an open-ended, permissive, flexible space. It seems that anything can happen within these walls. Enter a studio through its doorway (which has no door), and you <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> what {{is more like a}} stage, looking out through a proscenium framed by new steel posts and girders set parallel to and in tandem with the old concrete columns and beams.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} under almost {{perpetual}} re-write. [...] Thirteensongs were added between the {{production at the}} Public Theater and Broadway, including [...] "I Believe in Love". [...] "The Climax" [...] and [...] "Dead End" [...] were cut between the productions, and [...] "Exanaplanetooch" [...] and [...] "You <b>Are</b> <b>Standing</b> <b>on</b> My Bed" [...] were present in previews but cut before Broadway. [...] The Shakespearean speech [...] "What {{a piece of work}} is a man" [...] was originally spoken by Claude and musicalized by MacDermot for Broadway, and [...] "Hashish" [...] was formed from an early speech of Berger's. Subsequent productions have included [...] "Hello There", [...] "Dead End", and [...] "Hippie Life" [...] – a song originally written for the film that Rado included in several productions in Europe in the 1990s. The 2009 Broadway revival included the ten-second [...] "Sheila Franklin" [...] and [...] "O Great God of Power", two songs that were cut from the original production.|$|E
500|$|The Get Up Kids {{have had}} a lasting impact on the music scene, having been cited as inspirations to several {{prominent}} bands and artists. Blink-182 bassist and singer Mark Hoppus is a vocal fan, having proposed to his wife to The Get Up Kids song [...] "I'll Catch You." [...] They were also {{a major influence on}} the rest of the band, even at their peak popularity around the release of Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. The members of Fall Out Boy cite The Get Up Kids' influence, particularly their album Four Minute Mile. In a 2005 interview with Alternative Press, Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz stated that the band had a huge influence on him and the other members of Fall Out Boy. [...] "There should be a How To Be a Pop-Punk Kid starter kit with bands like Get Up Kids, so kids would know whose shoulders bands like us <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on.</b> Fall Out Boy would not be a band if it were not for The Get Up Kids." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{is based on}} a {{boarding}} school revolt. The video starts off with flash images of the exterior of an old school building. It then cuts to two separate lines of male and female students, the latter being led by Lisa and Jessica, marching down a school corridor. They were led by a teacher with a whip in her hand while being watched on surveillance cameras. The scene then shifts to the male students walking past a sign that says [...] "no girls beyond this point". The first verse then begins and the students are marching into a classroom and sit at individual tables. When the chorus begins, Lisa and Jessica <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> a stage in front of their band performing for rows of still students who stare back blankly. When the second verse begins the students are in the classroom while guards patrol its perimeter and the teacher hits a blackboard with a pointing stick. During the second chorus Lisa and Jessica get their band members together in a toilet to start their rebellion at the school. When the bridge starts smash cuts are shown of them taking over the school's PA system, and the students getting up from their chairs in the classrooms and throwing objects at a teacher {{standing in front of a}} blackboard. The video ends with everyone running down stairs out of the school, with Jessica and Lisa leading the way. The scenes are inter cut to scenes of Lisa and Jessica holding each other. They are dressed in tartan skirts with the former wearing a black cardigan and an open collared shirt, and the latter a black blazer and a shirt with a tartan patterned skinny tie. Both the cardigan and blazer have a striped crest with a pink [...] "V" [...] in the middle.|$|E
