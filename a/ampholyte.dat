Preparative-scale isoelectric separations often use buffering membranes (isoelectric membranes), but there are no good known methods for the characterization of their pI values. Therefore, UV-absorbing carrier <b>ampholyte</b> mixtures (UVCAs) have been synthesized, analytically characterized, and utilized for the characterization of the pI value of a buffering membrane. To synthesize the UVCAs, addition of a UV-absorbing electrophile, 3 -phenoxypropyl bromide (PhOPrBr), to a pentaethylenehexamine (PEHA) carrier <b>ampholyte</b> backbone, resulted in an intermediate that was subsequently reacted with increasing amounts of acrylic acid (up to 8 equiv) and itaconic acid (up to 2 equiv) via Michael??????s addition. The intermediates and final products were characterized by 1 H-NMR and full-column imaging capillary isoelectric focusing techniques. An optimal blended mixture of selected UVCAs was first desalted and purified by isoelectric trapping and its composition verified by full-column imaging isoelectric focusing. The mixture of UVCAs possessed a broad pI distribution from approximately pH 3 ?????? 10. By isoelectric trapping, the mixture was separated into two subfractions with a polyacrylamide-based isoelectric membrane of known pI as the separation membrane and poly(vinyl) alcohol-based buffering membranes as the restriction membranes.

The separate injection of the sample and the ampholytes provides good condition to suppress and overcome the undesirable effect of the presence of ampholytes in MS. By the appropriate selection of <b>ampholyte</b> solutions, whose pH range not necessarily covers the pI values of the analytes, the migration of the components can be controlled, and the impact of the ampholytes on MS detection is decreased.

Broad and narrow pH range ampholytes were applied in experiments using uncoated capillaries with different lengths for the analyses of substituted nitrophenol dyes to achieve optimal conditions for the MS detection.

40|$|Introduction. A {{description}} is given {{of the principle}} followed in the experimental determination of the ionisation of egg albumin, its capacity to combine with acids and bases. Egg albumin is regarded as an <b>ampholyte,</b> and in accordance with J. N. Brønsted's definition of acids and bases, ampholytes are considered as substances capable of both taking up and giving off hydrogen ions. The theoretical treatment of the capacity of ampholytes to combine with acids (and bases) {{has been carried out}} on this basis. Section A. Several experimental series are noted, comprising the determination of the activity coefficient of the hydrogen ion (fH) in ammonium chloride solutions of different concentration. Section B. The general method of experimental determination of the ionisation (capacity to combine with adds and bases) of egg albumin in ammonium chloride and potassium chloride solutions is briefly described, and the results of the experiments are compared. Section C. 1). In a brief theoretical survey we have suggested that distinction should be made between isoelectric and isoionic reaction of an <b>ampholyte,</b> the former defined as the hydrogen ion activity (value of paH) at which the mean valency of the <b>ampholyte</b> is 0, the latter as the hydrogen ion activity at which the quantity of acid or base combined with the <b>ampholyte</b> is 0; or, as we prefer to express it, the hydrogen ion activity at which the specific hydrogen ionisation of the <b>ampholyte</b> is 0. If the <b>ampholyte</b> does not combine with other ions than the hydrogen ion, then isoelectric and isoionic reaction coincide. Isoionic reaction is determined by acid-combining experiments. The principle of this determination is briefly described. A theoretical investigation of the alteration with salt concentration of both isoelectric (isoionic) reaction and the shape and direction of the ionisation curves is made, with regard to ampholytes capable only of combining with hydrogen ions, {{on the basis of the}} Debye-Hückel formulæ and Linderstrøm-Lang's theory for the ionisation of polyvalent ampholytes of simple type. It is shown that the salt effect, in accordance with the theory, and in qualitative agreement with the experiments, consists in a turning of the ionisation curves, indicating the relation between the quantity of combined acid (specific hydrogen ionisation) and paH, and the turning of the curves, which leaves the isoelectric reaction unaltered, tends in such a direction that the quantity of combined acid at constant <b>ampholyte</b> concentration and constant pan increases with increasing salt concentration. The possibility of chemical combining of other ions than the hydrogen ion is discussed. 2). Following on 1), a brief survey of the experimental results is given. 3). The isoionic reaction is found from the experimental material and proved to be independent of the ammonium chloride concentration. As the mean of all determinations we have paH 0 = 4. 898 (isoionic reaction). The difference between this value and that formerly found for ammonium sulphate solutions (4. 844) is discussed. 4). Finally, on the basis of the theory in Section 1), some simple calculations of the ionisation curves for egg albumin are made, and it appears that the theory can reproduce the experimental results in a rough quantitative way when we assume that the egg albumin has a radius of 2. 21 · 10 – 7 cm. (answering to a molecular weight of 35, 000 in aqueous solution), and contains 30 acid and base groups...|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model describing transient processes in isoelectric focusing (IEF) of M biprotic <b>ampholytes</b> is proposed. The problem consists of nonlinear partial differential equations and algebraic equations under nonlinear boundary conditions. Different models of IEF have been studied. For each model problem, we investigated the qualitative properties {{such as the}} local existence, global boundedness, stabilizations, and steady-state structures of its solutions. We have shown that, for all models the solutions of the evolution problem stabilize to the steady-state solutions, which have separate peaks {{at a certain point}} (the so-called isoelectric point). This means that for transient IEF processes, the concentrations of <b>ampholytes</b> will focus on their isoelectric points as time goes on.

40|$|The {{impact of}} initial sample {{distribution}} on separation and focusing of analytes in a pH 3 – 11 gradient formed by 101 biprotic carrier ampholytes under concomitant electroosmotic displacement was studied by dynamic high-resolution computer simulation. Data obtained with {{application of the}} analytes mixed with the carrier ampholytes (as is customarily done), as a short zone within the initial carrier <b>ampholyte</b> zone, sandwiched between zones of carrier ampholytes, or introduced {{before or after the}} initial carrier <b>ampholyte</b> zone were compared. With sampling as a short zone within or adjacent to the carrier ampholytes, separation and focusing of analytes is shown to proceed as a cationic, anionic, or mixed process and separation of the analytes is predicted to be much faster than the separation of the carrier components. Thus, after the initial separation, analytes continue to separate and eventually reach their focusing locations. This is different to the double-peak approach to equilibrium that takes place when analytes and carrier ampholytes are applied as a homogenous mixture. Simulation data reveal that sample application between two zones of carrier ampholytes results in the formation of a pH gradient disturbance as the concentration of the carrier ampholytes within the fluid element initially occupied by the sample will be lower compared to the other parts of the gradient. As a consequence thereof, the properties of this region are sample matrix dependent, the pH gradient is flatter, and the region is likely to represent a conductance gap (hot spot). Simulation data suggest that sample placed at the anodic side or at the anodic end of the initial carrier <b>ampholyte</b> zone are the favorable configurations for capillary isoelectric focusing with electroosmotic zone mobilization...|$|E

40|$|Isoelectric {{focusing}} of {{mixtures of}} simple ampholytes occurs in two phases, an initial rapid separation phase {{and a second}} relatively slow stabilizing phase. Transient and steady-state computer simulation data are shown to predict the development of pH plateaus around neutrality during the stabilizing phase of the focusing of such mixtures. This occurs because a nonzero electrophoretic flux is present in a pure zone of focused <b>ampholyte,</b> which {{is a function of}} both its isolectric point (pI) and its Delta-pK value. For an <b>ampholyte</b> with a pI greater than 9 or less than 5, this flux causes the development of a significant concentration gradient within its focused zone which is accompanied by a contraction of this zone along the focusing axis. Acidic and basic ampholytes are thereby displayed toward the anode and cathode respectively, creating a pH plateau in the neutral region. Thus, there will be regions of the focusing column, closer to the electrodes and containing more acidic or basic pH values, within which the resolution of samples will reach a maximum and then decrease...|$|E
40|$|Proteins, {{peptides}} or BGE <b>ampholytes</b> {{labeled with}} suitable dyes were previously suggested as pI markers.

40|$|Capillary isoelectric {{focusing}} of components following sequential injection of ampholytes and the sample zone offers unique advantages for analysis.

In this study, the effect of the pH of the anolyte and catholyte on the selectivity and speed of {{isoelectric focusing}} was investigated. Changes in the pH values significantly influenced the resolution and the length of the pH gradient, while changes in the charge-state of components were also observed.

On performing titration experiments at three different pH values, carrier ampholytes act like nitrilotriacetate at pH 7. 5, but the former are more effective iron donors at pH 8. 4 and worse iron donors at pH 5. 2. Spectrophotometric titrations of isolated C-terminal and N-terminal fragments obtained from human serum transferrin by thermolysin cleavage show no differences between them, and no differences with respect to the whole protein except that they contain half the number of binding sites. In order to determine a site-specificity of iron in the presence of ampholytes, the classical urea/polyacrylamide-gel-electrophoresis technique was adopted. Under saturating conditions carrier <b>ampholyte</b> solutions act mostly on the C-terminal site, whereas desaturating agents remove iron preferentially from the N-terminal site.

The effectiveness of pretreatment of serum samples with ferrous/ferric salts is discussed, and incubation times optimized after spectrophotometric measurement of the monoferric Tf conversion. Most of the presently available commercial batches of carrier <b>ampholytes</b> do not reliably discriminate the six common TfC subtypes. Resolution of C 1, C 3 and C 2 was achieved by adding 20 to 90 mM HEPES slab gels prepared with various carrier <b>ampholytes.</b> Isoelectric focusing in carrier ampholyte-separator pH gradients cannot be recommended as a standard typing procedure because the results strongly depend on the batch of carrier <b>ampholytes.</b> Tf subtype resolution was only achieved by using isoelectric focusing in immobilized pH gradients with pH slopes reliably reproducible from one experiment to another. Two major shortcomings of immobilized pH gradients are a marked tendency to protein precipitation at the application site and an interaction of proteins with the charged matrix.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of sample components whose pI values {{are outside the}} pH gradient established by 101 hypothetical biprotic carrier <b>ampholytes</b> covering a pH 6 - 8 range was investigated by computer simulation under constant current conditions with concomitant constant electroosmosis toward the cathode. Data obtained with the sample being applied between zones of carrier <b>ampholytes</b> and on the anodic side of the carrier <b>ampholytes</b> were studied and found to evolve into zone structures comprising three regions between anolyte and catholyte. The focusing region with the pH gradient is bracketed by two isotachopheretic zone structures comprising selected sample and carrier components as isotachophoretic zones. The isotachophoretic structures electrophoretically migrate in opposite direction and their lengths increase with time due to the gradual isotachophoretic decay at the pH gradient edges. Due to electroosmosis, however, the overall pattern is being transported toward the cathode. Sample components whose pI values are outside the established pH gradient are demonstrated to form isotachophoretic zones behind the leading cation of the catholyte (components with pI values larger than 8) and the leading anion of the anolyte (components with pI values smaller than 6). Amphoteric compounds with appropriate pI values or nonamphoteric components can act as isotachophoretic spacer compounds between sample compounds or between the leader and the sample with the highest mobility.
