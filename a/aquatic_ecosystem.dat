5|$|Turbulent {{forces in}} {{air and water}} affect the {{environment}} and ecosystem distribution, form and dynamics. On a planetary scale, ecosystems are affected by circulation patterns in the global trade winds. Wind power and the turbulent forces it creates can influence heat, nutrient, and biochemical profiles of ecosystems. For example, wind running {{over the surface of}} a lake creates turbulence, mixing the water column and influencing the environmental profile to create thermally layered zones, affecting how fish, algae, {{and other parts of the}} <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystem</b> are structured. Wind speed and turbulence also influence evapotranspiration rates and energy budgets in plants and animals. Wind speed, temperature and moisture content can vary as winds travel across different land features and elevations. For example, the westerlies come into contact with the coastal and interior mountains of western North America to produce a rain shadow on the leeward side of the mountain. The air expands and moisture condenses as the winds increase in elevation; this is called orographic lift and can cause precipitation. This environmental process produces spatial divisions in biodiversity, as species adapted to wetter conditions are range-restricted to the coastal mountain valleys and unable to migrate across the xeric ecosystems (e.g., of the Columbia Basin in western North America) to intermix with sister lineages that are segregated to the interior mountain systems.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{production}} of reactive nitrogen (Nr) from atmospheric di-nitrogen (N 2) has greatly contributed to increased food production. However, enriching the biosphere with Nr has also caused {{a series of}} negative effects on global <b>ecosystems,</b> especially <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> The main pathway converting Nr back into the atmospheric N 2 pool is the last step in the denitrification process. Despite several attempts, {{there is still a}} need for perturbation-free methods for measuring in situ N 2 fluxes from denitrification in <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> at the field scale. Such a method is needed to comprehensively quantify the N 2 fluxes from <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Here we observed linear relationships between the δ 15 N-N 2 O signatures and the logarithmically transformed N 2 O/(N 2 +N 2 O) emission ratios.

Our method allowed the determination of field-scale in situ N 2 fluxes from nitrate-rich <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> both with and without overlaying water.

25|$|Based on {{the river}} basin water data {{available}} from the year 1934 to 1971 (44 years back data), the tribunal estimated the average water yield in the total river basin as 767 TMC which corresponds to 47% dependability. The live storage capacity available in the river basin is nearly 310 TMC which is 40.5% of the average yield. The water used in the Cauvery delta in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry is nearly 280 TMC which is the tail end water use in the river basin and its regenerated water either goes to sea or outside the Cauvery basin. The total dissolved salt load generated in the basin is nearly 3.5 million metric tons per year. The estimated salinity or total dissolved salts (TDS) for the water available in Cauvery delta is 441 ppm which {{is close to the}} safe maximum permissible 500 ppm. There is no limit imposed by the tribunal for the ground water use in the river basin. The tribunal has also permitted the basin states to use all the excess water available in above normal water years. Moreover, the river basin population has reached 40 million in the year 2015 and the increasing per capita inorganic salts used/consumed in industrial, agriculture and residential sectors are enhancing the salt export requirements. When adequate salt export from the river basin is not taking place to the sea by forcing Cauvery delta to face water shortage, the water quality (salinity, pH, alkalinity, sodicity, etc.) available for Cauvery delta would deteriorate beyond the permissible limits impeding its sustainable productivity and its <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystem</b> conservation. Ultimately salt export criteria is the limitation for the water resources development in a river basin.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, {{the provincial}} {{and federal governments}} {{completed}} {{the construction of a}} causeway between the communities of Moncton and Riverview to provide a crossing over the river, and to keep water levels from impeding agricultural production. This was a benefit for the federal government at the time, which had constantly maintained the dykes in the area. It also benefited the provincial government, as the federal government was willing to fund the $3million project, but not a bridge. Although the causeway was equipped with a fishway, problems arose when fish were unable to cross it freely due to sedimentation build-up; some 82percent of the salmon were prevented from travelling upstream by the structure. The sediment accumulated in the [...] of river downstream from the causeway, with over 10million cubic metres (13million cubic yards) of silt deposited in the first three years following construction. Several reports from 1969 to 1971 described its impact on the <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystem,</b> and proposals for amendments to the causeway gates were released, but no action was taken.

40|$|Recent, {{parallel}} {{developments in}} the study of freshwater and marine ecosystems have provided evidence that net heterotrophic systems (those in which respiratory organic matter destruction exeeds photosynthetic production) are more prevalent than hitherto believed, including most rivers, oligo- to mesotrophic lakes and some oligotrophic regions of the ocean. In parallel, these <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> have been shown to act as CO 2 sources to the atmosphere, as expected from the heterotrophic nature of the communities they contain. The prevalence of net heterotrophic <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> indicates that they must receive significant inputs of organic carbon from adjacent ecosystems, assigning an important role to the lateral exchanges of carbon between land and <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> between coastal and open ocean ecosystems, as well as internal redistribution within large or complex <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> in determining their metabolic status and the gaseous exchange with the atmosphere.

40|$|Abstract: Contamination of <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> {{is always}} {{of concern to}} {{environmental}} scientists; however, these systems also possess unique capabilities allowing them to eliminate or remediate certain levels of pollutants. Primarily through the presence of vegetation, <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> {{are known to be}} capable of removing or at least decreasing pollutant loads travelling through the aqueous phase. In addition to vegetation, soil/sediment and microbes {{play a significant role in}} transferring or transforming pollutants to acceptable levels in <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> This chapter focuses on some of the primary literature describing phytoremediation of organic pollutants (e. g. hydrocarbons and pesticides) and inorganic pollutants (e. g. metals and nutrients). Research indicates the popularity and success of phytoremediation techniques used to clean up both organic and inorganic pollutants from the water column. While certain caution should always be exercised, phytoremediation continues to serve as a successful means of pollutant remediation in <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems...</b>|$|R

[...] These high levels of nutrients can reduce oxygen and boost algae growth while limiting native vegetation growth. [...] Limited native vegetation and excessive algae has the potential to disrupt the entire <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystem</b> due to limited light penetration, lower oxygen levels, and reduced food reserves.
