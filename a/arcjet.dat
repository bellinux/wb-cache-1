25|$|The Propulsion Directorate {{was formed}} through {{the merger of}} the {{aerospace}} propulsion section at Wright Laboratory and the space propulsion section at Phillips Laboratory. Each section, {{both before and after}} the merger, has played a significant role in past and present propulsion systems. Prior to the development of Project Apollo by NASA, the Air Force worked on the development and testing of the F-1 rocket engine used to power the Saturn V rocket. The facilities for testing rockets are frequently used for testing new rocket engines including the RS-68 rocket engine developed for use on the Delta IV launch vehicle. The space propulsion area also develops technologies for use in satellites on-orbit to alter their orbits. An AFRL-developed experimental Electric Propulsion Space Experiment (ESEX) <b>arcjet</b> was flown on the ARGOS satellite in 1999 as part of the Air Force Space Test Program.|$|E
2500|$|ESEX - Electric Propulsion Space Experiment (1990-13/AFRL-Edwards AFB): [...] {{an effort}} by the Air Force Research Laboratoryâ€™s Propulsion Directorate (Edwards AFB, CA) {{demonstrated}} a high-powered electric propulsion provided by a 26 kilowatt ammonia fueled <b>arcjet.</b> [...] Its use in space and evaluate its performance and interactions with other experiments and spacecraft systems on board a satellite. [...] Through the ionizing of ammonia, ESEX's electric propulsion was expected to double the payload-to-orbit capability of current space propulsion systems. [...] The ammonia propellant consumed was four times less than the best performing chemical rocket engine in use at that time. [...] For the team, the best information gathered was the validation that firing the highest powered electric propulsion system in space did not interrupt telemetry or affect other equipment on the spacecraft.|$|E
50|$|An <b>arcjet</b> rocket or <b>arcjet</b> {{thruster}} {{is a form}} of {{electrically powered}} spacecraft propulsion, in which an electrical discharge (arc) is created in a flow of propellant (typically hydrazine or ammonia). This imparts additional energy to the propellant, so that one can extract more work out of each kilogram of propellant, at the expense of increased power consumption and (usually) higher cost. Also, the thrust levels available from typically used <b>arcjet</b> engines are very low compared with chemical engines.|$|E
50|$|When {{the energy}} is available, <b>arcjets</b> are {{well suited to}} keeping {{stations}} in orbit and can replace monopropellant rockets.|$|R
40|$|The present {{parametric}} tradeoff {{study for}} OTV electric propulsion systems encompasses ammonia and hydrogen <b>arcjets</b> {{as well as}} Xe-ion propulsion systems with performance characteristics currently being projected for 1993 operation. In all cases, the power source is a nuclear-electric system with 30 kg/kW(e) specific mass, and the mission involves the movement of payloads from lower orbits to GEO. Attention is given to payload capabilities and associated propellant requirements. Mission trip time is identified as the key parameter for selection; while <b>arcjets</b> are preferable for shorter trip times, ion propulsion is more advantageous for longer trip times due to reduced propellant mass fraction...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss the {{development}} of Electric Propulsion technology in the U. S. from the 1960 's to the present. It will summarize the various activities related to <b>arcjets,</b> resistojets, pulsed plasma thrustors, magneto-plasma-dynamic thrustors, ion engines, and more recently the evaluation of Hall effect thrustors of the SPT or Anode Layer type developed in Russia. Also, demonstration test flight and actual mission applications will be summarized. Finally, the future application of electric propulsion to near-term commercial communications satellites and planetary missions will be projected. This history is rich in diversity, and has involved a succession of types of thrustors, propellants, and electric power sources. With the recent use of <b>arcjets</b> on commercial communication satellites and the flight tests of ion engines for this application, it appears that electric propulsion is finally {{on the verge of}} wide spread application...|$|R

50|$|Ames {{developed}} and operated critical facilities including flight simulators and wind tunnels, pushing {{the frontiers of}} computers and the <b>arcjets</b> facility to test materials at very high temperatures, which were critical to high-speed aircraft development and space vehicle re-entry. Ames largest contribution to the early space program for human missions was solving the problem of getting astronauts safely back to Earth, {{through the development of}} the blunt body design for re-entry vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The main {{concept is}} a nexus of Solar panels on {{spacecraft}} and ion thruster. However, {{there are a}} number of other types of Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion such as the <b>Arcjet.</b> It may not employ an ion drive, of which there are a variety of types also.|$|E
50|$|VASIMR, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Electro-thermal Plasma Thruster or Electro-thermal Magnetoplasma Rocket, uses radio waves to ionize and heat the propellant, which is then accelerated with magnetic fields to generate thrust. This engine is electrodeless, of the same propulsion family as the electrodeless plasma thruster, the microwave <b>arcjet</b> or the pulsed inductive thruster class. It has been described as an electrodeless version of an <b>arcjet</b> rocket that can reach higher propellant temperature by limiting the heat flux from the plasma to the structure. Neither type of engine uses electrodes. This eliminates the electrode erosion that shortens the equipment life of rival ion thruster designs. Since every part of a VASIMR engine is magnetically shielded and does not directly contact plasma, the durability of this engine is predicted to be greater than many other ion/plasma engines.|$|E
50|$|Electric {{power has}} a long history of use in {{spacecraft}}. The power sources used for spacecraft are batteries, solar panels and nuclear power. Current methods of propelling a spacecraft with electricity include the <b>arcjet</b> rocket, the electrostatic ion thruster, the Hall effect thruster, and Field Emission Electric Propulsion. A number of other methods have been proposed, with varying levels of feasibility.|$|E
50|$|Because {{spacecraft}} only {{contain a}} finite amount {{of fuel and}} there is little chance to refill them, some alternative reaction control systems have been developed so that fuel can be conserved. For stationkeeping, some spacecraft (particularly those in geosynchronous orbit) use high-specific-impulse engines such as <b>arcjets,</b> ion thrusters, or Hall effect thrusters. To control orientation, a few spacecraft, including the ISS, use momentum wheels which spin to control rotational rates on the vehicle.|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of onset in MHD <b>arcjets</b> is studied. An earlier solution procedure {{is combined with}} an onset criterion to obtain the onset boundary curves for hydrogen and argon. The onset boundary curves are in qualitative agreement with experimental results. It is found that the engine-specific impulse at onset can be increased by increasing the propellant low-temperature electrical conductivity.

The measurements were conducted using a copper-tungsten cathode material to accelerate the cathode erosion process. It is shown that the high ripple erosion rate was initially higher than the low ripple erosion rate, but decreased asymptotically with time to a level less than half that of the low ripple value. Results suggest that high ripple extends the cathode lifetime for long duration operation, and improves arc stability by increasing the cathode attachment area...|$|R

40|$|In {{the attempt}} to fill the {{performance}} niche between the <b>arcjet</b> and Hall thruster, we propose {{the use of a}} helium <b>arcjet</b> to neutralize Hall thrusters. Since the <b>arcjet</b> is a high plasma density device, one <b>arcjet</b> can potentially neutralize a cluster of Hall thrusters. In this preliminary study, we used a surrogate planar anode in the place of a Hall thruster anode {{to determine the effects of}} drawing electron current from a low power <b>arcjet</b> plume on the operation and performance of the <b>arcjet.</b> In all tests we are able to draw currents to the surrogate anode that were greater than the arc current. It is found that biasing the surrogate anode does lead to a perturbation in the <b>arcjet</b> discharge voltage, in some cases resulting in a voltage decrease of up to 40 %. The helium <b>arcjet</b> exhibits arc voltage instabilities in the same spectral range of the instabilities that are intrinsic in Hall thrusters. We find however, that these <b>arcjet</b> instabilities decreased in strength and in bandwidth when a bias is applied to the anode. The effect of biasing on the overall <b>arcjet</b> performance (e. g., thrust, specific impulse) is still under investigation.
