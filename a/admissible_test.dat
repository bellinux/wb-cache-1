40|$|Abstract—Automating the {{functional}} testing of reactive systems requires {{to provide a}} formal specification of the system environment which defines the <b>admissible</b> <b>test</b> inputs. It also requires a specification of the expected properties of the system in order to decide whether a test succeeds or fails.

In this paper, we report some experiments that have been conducted within a project in collaboration with industrial developers of nuclear power plant control systems. In this project, automatic testing tools have been used for checking the correctness of reactive systems developed incrementally, using heterogeneous industrial engineering workbenches. But these tools appeared to be useful also for elaborating and refining formal, consistent, and accurate functional requirements. I...|$|E

Impose the linear combination loss function under which the risk becomes a constant c, times the expected sample size, plus the probability of error. It is known that all admissible tests must be monotone [...] that is, they stop and accept if Sn, the sample sum at stage n, satisfies Sn≤an; stop and reject if Sn≥bn.

The bound 2 b¯(c) is sharp in the sense that the test with stopping bounds an≡−b¯(c),bn≡b¯(c) is admissible.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a linear panel data model with reduced rank regressors and interactive fixed eff ects. The leading {{example is a}} factor model {{where some of the}} factors are observed, some others not. Invariance considerations yield a maximal invariant statistic whose density does not depend on incidental parameters. It is natural to consider a likelihood ratio test based on the maximal invariant statistic. Its density can be found by using as a prior the unique invariant distribution for the incidental parameters. That invariant distribution is least favorable and leads to minimax optimality properties. Combining the invariant distribution with a prior for the remaining parameters gives a class of <b>admissible</b> <b>tests.</b> A particular choice of distribution yields the spiked covariance model of Johnstone (2001). Numerical simulations suggest that the maximal invariant likelihood ratio test outperforms the standard likelihood ratio test.

40|$|The goal of Bounded-Exhaustive Testing (BET) is the {{automatic}} generation {{of all the}} test cases satisfying a given invariant, within a given bound. When the input has a complex structure, the development of correct and efficient generators becomes a very challenging task. In this paper we use Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) to systematically develop generators of structurally complex test data. Similarly to filtering -based test generation, we follow a declarative approach which allows us to separate the issue of (i) defining the test structure and invariant, from that of (ii) generating <b>admissible</b> <b>test</b> input instances. This separation helps improve the correctness of the developed test case generators. However, in contrast with filtering approaches, we rely on a symbolic representation and we take advantage of efficient search strategies provided by CLP systems for generating test instances. Through some experiments on examples taken from the literature on BET, we show that CLP, by combining the use of constraints and recursion, allows one to write intuitive and easily understandable test generators. We also show that these generators can be much more efficient than those built using ad-hoc filtering-based test generation tools like Korat...|$|E
40|$|Similarity {{of a test}} {{is often}} a {{necessary}} condition for a test to be unbiased (in particular for a test to be uniformly most powerful unbiased when such a test exists). Lehmann (Testing Statistical Hypotheses, 2 nd Edition, Wiley, New York, 1986) describes the connection between similar tests and uniformly most powerful unbiased tests. The methods to achieve these properties as outlined in Lehmann are used extensively. In any case, an admissible similar test is frequently one that can be recommended for practical use. In some constrained parameter spaces however, we show that admissible similar tests sometimes completely ignore the constraints. In some of these cases we call such tests constraint insensitive. The tests seem not to be intuitive and perhaps should not be used. On the other hand, there are models with constrained parameter spaces where similar tests do take into account the constraints. In these cases the <b>admissible</b> <b>test</b> is called constraint sensitive. We offer a systematic approach that enables one to determine whether an admissible similar test is constraint insensitive or not. The approach is applied to three classes of models involving order restricted parameters. The models include testing for homogeneity of parameters, testing subsets of parameters, and testing goodness of fit of a family of discrete distributions.

For this objective, none of the available testing approaches are completely satisfactory. A new class of <b>admissible</b> adaptive <b>tests</b> is derived. Each test in this class strictly preserves the Type I error rate and strikes a balance between good global power and nearly optimal (envelope) power to detect a specific alternative of most interest.

The {{need and}} {{goal of the}} study CAT (Computer-based Adaptive Testing) is a {{computer}} based evaluation device to assess accurate and effective measurement of ones attainment and psychological status (Sung, 1992; Sung, 1998; Baek, 1994).

40|$|For a two-sided {{hypothesis}} testing, it {{is known}} that there does not exist UMP tests. Uniformly most powerful unbiased (UMPU) tests and likelihood ratio test are the common approaches to two-sided testing. The p-values of these tests are usually used as evidence against null hypothesis. However, there are criticisms of p-values as a measure of evidence against null hypothesis for the two-sided testing problem in lit-erature. Thus, in this paper, evidence measures derived from Bayesian approach are proposed to be the replacements of p-values and are in-vestigated from both decision and testing perspectives. From decision theoretic framework, the proposed evidence measures can be demon-strated as admissible estimators, however, p-value of UMPU <b>test</b> are not <b>admissible</b> estimators; from <b>testing</b> aspect, the tests derived from p-values and the proposed evidence measures are shown to be UMPU tests.
