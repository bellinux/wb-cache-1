Both legitimized <b>authoritarian</b> <b>rule</b> by saying that corruption in the Senate was hampering {{the powers of the}} head of state; both pressured the Senate to grant extraordinary powers to deal with a crisis, falsely claiming that they would rescind those powers once the crisis was over; and both relied on their strong control over military force.|$|E

He died soon after in Bucharest, and was buried in the World War I heroes' crypt in Mărăști. In December, the king created the National Renaissance Front as the political instrument of his <b>authoritarian</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|E
5|$|The postwar climate sees {{a period}} of {{austerity}} and mistrust towards the machines. Returning from {{the horrors of the}} war, Marke becomes the Consul of Berlin and instates a reign of isolation and deurbanization. Advanced weapons are destroyed, people are driven out into the countryside to cultivate the land, and the giant energy accumulators are destroyed. Columns made to look like bulls are erected in city squares and at crossroads, and roar twice a day like a dying animal to remind people of the catastrophe of the Ural War. Marduk succeeds Marke as the Consul and continues the period of brutal <b>authoritarian</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the interwar period, {{nationalism}} {{grew stronger}} on the continent, influenced by countries like Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. A series of <b>authoritarian</b> <b>rules</b> {{broke out in}} South American countries with views bringing them closer to the Axis Powers, like Vargas's Brazil or Perón's Argentina. In the late 20th century, during the Cold War, many countries became military dictatorships under American tutelage in attempts to avoid {{the influence of the}} Soviet Union. After the fall of the authoritarian regimes, these countries became democratic republics.|$|R
5|$|He had {{restored}} American {{credit and}} assumed state debt; created a bank, a mint, a coast guard, a customs service, and a diplomatic corps; introduced the first accounting, tax, and budgetary procedures; maintained peace {{at home and}} abroad; inaugurated a navy, bolstered the army, and shored up coastal defenses and infrastructure; proved that the country could regulate commerce and negotiate binding treaties; protected frontier settlers, subdued Indian uprisings, and established law and order amid rebellion, scrupulously adhering all the while to {{the letter of the}} Constitution...

5|$|<b>Authoritarian</b> <b>rule</b> {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E
5|$|President Antanas Smetona's {{unconditional}} {{acceptance of a}} second ultimatum {{in the space of}} a little over one year became a major source of dissatisfaction with his <b>authoritarian</b> <b>rule.</b> The German ultimatum triggered a political crisis: the passive cabinet of Vladas Mironas was replaced by a cabinet headed by General Jonas Černius. For the first time since the 1926 coup d'état, the government included members of the opposition: Leonas Bistras, of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, was named Minister of Education and Jurgis Krikščiūnas, of the Lithuanian Popular Peasants' Union, was named Minister of Agriculture. Because other parties were banned, Bistras and Krikščiūnas were officially billed as independent private citizens. Four generals were now members of the cabinet as well. However, even the looming international crisis did not induce Lithuanian politicians to unite, and they continued to engage in petty political disputes.|$|E
50|$|The Feminist Art Program {{began at}} the California Institute of the Arts in 1971 after an {{experimental}} year at Fresno State College under the name Womens Art Program. The students in the program were admitted as a group when Chicago and Schapiro were hired at Cal Arts after Chicago found that the Fresno State College Art department was reluctant to embrace her vision {{of a new kind}} of female centered art. It was their intention to teach without the use of <b>authoritarian</b> <b>rules</b> or a unilateral flow of power from teacher to student.|$|R
50|$|It is memorable {{literary}} inquisition in Chinese {{history of}} newspaper. In Chinese history, the feudal class never allowed speeches of offence to governors {{in order to}} maintain <b>authoritarian</b> <b>rules.</b> They use literary inquisition as their weapon to control those who dare to say something, especially in Qing and Ming Dynasty. Since modern times when newspapers came into being, rulers was trying to suppress and control them. Su Bao Case showed a conflict between feudal rulers and modern progressive intelligences. And it may be the oldest and most typical literary inquisition in the press during the history of China.|$|R

5|$|The US media's {{links to}} Thảo {{have been the}} source of {{historical}} debate. The journalists' reporting of Diệm's <b>authoritarian</b> <b>rule,</b> military failures, and attacks on Buddhists shifted American public opinion and put pressure on Washington to withdraw support for the Ngô family and seek a change of leadership. William Prochnau felt that the fall of Diệm was the biggest influence of the media on American foreign policy in over six decades. Thảo and Phạm Xuân Ẩn had {{been the source of}} much of the media's information. Conservative revisionist historians have accused the media of bringing down Diệm by publishing reports that, according to them, were based on false data disseminated by communist propagandists to unfairly malign Diệm's rule, which they claim was effective and fair towards the Buddhist majority.|$|E
5|$|When the loyalist {{reinforcements}} {{rolled into}} the capital aboard tanks and armored vehicles and began to wrest the initiative, the rebels began to break. After a brief, violent battle that killed around 400 people, the coup attempt was crushed. The casualties included {{a large number of}} anti-Diệm civilians; Thi exhorted them to bring down the Ngô family by charging the palace; 13 were gunned down by the loyalist soldiers as they invaded the grounds. After the failed coup, Đông, Thi and other prominent officers fled to Tan Son Nhut and climbed aboard a C-47. They fled to Cambodia, where they were given asylum by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, a long-time Diệm opponent. Diệm promptly reneged on his promises, and intensified his <b>authoritarian</b> <b>rule</b> and crackdowns on dissidents. Almost three years after the incident, Diệm opened the trial for those involved in the coup on 8 July 1963. Thi and his fellow exiled officers were found guilty and sentenced to death in absentia. In the meantime, Thi lived self-sufficiently in Cambodia for three years.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September 2013 on Raw, Cody Rhodes {{was fired}} from the WWE after failing to defeat the WWE Champion Randy Orton, a non-title match into which Rhodes was forced after he {{questioned}} the company's chief operating officer Triple H's <b>authoritarian</b> <b>rule.</b> Goldust returned the following week and similarly lost to Orton in a non-title match, thus failing to get his half-brother rehired. Eventually, their father Dusty Rhodes returned to Raw {{in an attempt to}} convince Stephanie McMahon to give his sons their jobs back. Instead, McMahon propositioned that Dusty could choose either one of his sons to receive a job, but not both. Dusty refused and Big Show knocked out Dusty as per McMahon's orders. In return, the Rhodes Brothers ambushed Triple H's henchmen the Shield on Raw. The next week, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon (later known as the Authority) offered the brothers their jobs back if they could defeat the Shield's Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns (the WWE Tag Team Champions) at Battleground. If they lost, they would never work in WWE again and Dusty would lose his job as a trainer at the WWE Performance Center. All three members of the Rhodes family were then attacked by the Shield, including United States Champion Dean Ambrose. On October 6 at Battleground, the Rhodes Brothers made their debut match as a tag team with Dusty backing them up at ringside. Ambrose attempted to interfere, and was taken out by Dusty. Soon after, Cody pinned Rollins in the non-title match to earn the brothers' jobs back. Various WWE wrestlers and agents came out to celebrate with the Rhodes family, including Arn Anderson, Dean Malenko, and Dave Finlay.|$|E

50|$|After gaining power, the anti-Mengistu {{alliance}} started removing weaker {{members of}} the party from power, creating a new authoritarian system.

50|$|The other {{event was}} the May Coup d’Etat (1926). On 12 May, Marshall Józef Piłsudski, displeased with the {{situation}} in Poland, and in particular with {{the appointment of a}} new government, arrived in Warsaw from his residence in Sulejówek (a small town east of Warsaw) {{at the head of the}} faithful troops. On the Poniatowski Bridge, he talked with the President Stanisław Wojciechowski, who tried unsuccessfully to convince him to give up the action. The next day, the Piłsudski’s troops forcibly conquered Warsaw and forced the government and Wojciechowski to resign. During the coup, street fighting killed almost 400 people—mostly civilians who wanted to watch the fighting. The May Coup started the 13-year period of sanation - the <b>authoritarian</b> <b>rules</b> of Piłsudski’s camp. Although Piłsudski himself never accepted the office of President (but twice was Prime Minister), always played a preponderant role in Polish political life.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} a {{range of}} arguments put forward to explain how financial surveillance of non-governmental organisations empowers authoritarianism in the post-transitional Hungarian context. In doing so, it attempts {{to shed light on}} the limitations of existing surveillance theories regarding the historical component of surveillance tolerance and the different modes of governance in post-communist European countries. It argues that post-transitional disappointment in democratic governance is causing Hungarians to become resigned to political decisions and to support new forms of <b>authoritarian</b> <b>rules.</b> Such a stoic attitude and the historically embedded surveillance culture facilitate the use of monitoring mechanisms that not only target terrorists as an external security threat, but also target NGOs defined as ‘the enemies of national values’. Hungarian authoritarian policies are not facilitated by extended surveillance practices, as Anglo-Saxon theories have regularly argued, but by the way they are used as an instrument of a political deterrence strategy against political opponents...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to examine Egyptian {{university}} students´attitudes about the Egyptian education system´s ability to support a democratic process in Egypt. In order to carry out my study, scientific books and articles have been read and interviews have been made among Egyptian university students. The interviews contained questions about the Egyptian education system´s impact on the democratic process in Egypt and which impact the Egyptian education system has had on the Egyptian revolution. The conclusion drawn from my study is that Egyptian university students find the contemporary Egyptian education system based on <b>authoritarian</b> <b>rules</b> and {{with a lack of}} democratic values. The Egyptian university students believe that to establish democratic institutions in Egypt, the Egyptian citizens need a better understanding about democratic values. However, some of the students believe that the democracy that should be established in Egypt, must be based on Islamic values and to succeed with that, Islamic studies must play a greater part in the Egyptian education. When it comes to the Egyptian education system´s impact on the Egyptian revolution the Egyptian university students´opinions were somehow divided. ...|$|R
