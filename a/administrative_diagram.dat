40|$|Detta projekt har genomförts under våren 2016 som ett examensarbete för högskole- ingenjörsprogrammet i innovationsteknik och design vid fakulteten för hälsa, natur- och teknikvetenskap på Karlstads universitet. Den största delen av arbetet utfördes på BAE Systems Bofors ABs eftermarknads- avdelning i Karlskoga. Där gjordes intervjuer och observationer för att kartlägga det nuvarande flödet och tillämpa metoder kring ett förbättringsarbete som studerats under projektets förstudie. Förstudien omfattade en stor litteraturunder-sökning kring arbetssätt och metoder för förbättringsarbeten, som sammanfattades i rapportens teoretiska referensram. De metoder som användes under projektet grundades i arbetssätten Lean och Sex Sigma samt den produktutvecklingsprocess som studerats tidigare under utbildningen. Några exempel på metoder som utfördes under projektet var administrativt spagettidiagram, värdeflödesanalys, ABC-analys och brainstorming. Sammanlagt hittades tolv problemområden i eftermarknadsflödet som studerades närmre. Dessa sammanfattades slutligen i en manual tillsammans med en djupare analys varför de olika problemen uppstått, förslag på hur de skulle kunna lösas eller förbättras samt förslag på hur ett eventuellt utslag av ett infört förbättringsarbete skulle kunna mätas. Exempel på ett problemområde som hittades under arbetet och sammanställdes i manualen var att företaget inte arbetade integrerat och behövde prioritera sitt eftermarknadsflöde. I lösningsförslaget förklarades varför företaget skulle ha fördel till att satsa mer på sin eftermarknad och dess flöde, hur viktigt det är att sätta kunden i fokus och att motivera samtliga medarbetare i flödet att arbeta effektivt. Det måttförslag som presenterades tillsammans med detta problemområde var en medarbetarenkät. I slutet av manualen presenterades även en prioritetsordning på de tolv avsnitten, för att företaget skulle ha underlag till att enkelt föra en diskussion om hur ett förbättrings- arbete skulle kunna påbörjas.  The {{project has}} been {{implemented}} as a thesis of Bachelor of Science in Innovation and Design at the Faculty of Health, Science and Technology at Karlstad University {{in the spring of}} 2016. Most of the work has been performed at BAE Systems Bofors AB’s aftermarket section in Karlskoga. The work included interviews and observations to identify the current flow and to apply methods of improvement on it. The feasibility study involved a large literature study on the methods and techniques of improvement, as summarized in the report's theoretical chapter. The methods that were used in the project were found in Lean, Six Sigma and the product development process, all of which were studied earlier in the education. Some examples of methods that were applied in the project were <b>administrative</b> spaghetti <b>diagrams,</b> Value Stream Mapping-analysis, ABC-analysis and brainstorming. A lot of problems were found in the aftermarket flow and twelve of those were more closely studied. These twelve problems were then summarized in a manual along with an in-depth analysis on why the problem had occurred, suggestions on how they could be resolved or improved and proposals on how a possible alteration of an introduced improvement could be measured. One example of problems that were found and gathered in the manual was that the company doesn’t work in an integrated way and need to prioritize the aftermarket flow. The suggested solution was to explain to the company why they would have to spend more resources on the aftermarket flow and motivate all employees that are involved. The solution also explained {{how important it is to}} focus on the customer and get the employees in the flow to work more efficiently. At the end of the manual a priority list of the twelve problem areas is presented. This priority list was made so the company more easily could start a discussion about the improvement work and how it could begin. ...|$|R
