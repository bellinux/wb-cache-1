40|$|Embedded {{devices are}} crucial {{enablers}} of the Internet of Things and become increasingly common {{in our daily}} life. They store, manipulate and transmit sensitive information and, therefore, must be protected against security threats. Due to the security and also resource constraint concerns, designing secure networked embedded systems is a difficult task. Model-based development (MBD) is promoted to address complexity and ease the design of software intensive systems. We leverage MBD and domain-specific modelling to characterise common issues related to security and embedded systems that are specific to a given application domain. Security-specific knowledge relevant for a certain application domain is represented {{in the form of}} an adapted information security ontology. Further, the elements of the ontology are associated with security building blocks modelled with the MBD method SPACE. The selection of relevant security building blocks is based on (i) <b>assets</b> <b>automatically</b> elicited from the functional models, (ii) domain security knowledge captured by the security expert and (iii) the platform adopted by the embedded system engineer. A tool is developed to support the steps supporting this methodology and help to bridge between the security and embedded systems domains.

Data collection is the most time-consuming task in the development of an asset management system. In order to reduce the time and cost involved in data collection, this paper proposes a low cost Mobile Mapping System using an equipped laser scanner and cameras.

40|$|As the {{popularity}} of social networks expands, the information users expose to the public has potentially dangerous implications for individual privacy. While social networks allow users to restrict access to their personal data, there is currently no mechanism to enforce privacy concerns over content uploaded by other users. As group photos and stories are shared by friends and family, personal privacy goes beyond the discretion of what a user uploads about himself and becomes an issue of what every network participant reveals.

Specifically, we analyze Facebook to identify scenarios where conflicting privacy settings between friends will reveal information {{that at least one}} user intended to keep private.

40|$|I {{examine the}} problem of writing {{guaranteed}} renewable health insurance {{in the presence of}} medical spending growth. Prior research suggests that the growth and difficulty in forecasting future medical costs is an impediment to multiperiod health insurance, where contract reserves are used to pay a portion of the benefits in later years of the contract. Medical spending growth is an input to calculating the magnitude of premiums and reserves, so setting up reserves to pay future claims involves forecasting spending growth. Hedging assets can ameliorate the investment problem by providing <b>assets</b> that <b>automatically</b> adjust to unexpected shocks in spending growth. ^ I expand an existing model of guaranteed renewability in an economy with risk to show the specific ways that medical spending growth enters the premium and reserve functions. I treat stochastic trend as a factor the insurance company can predict with error. I utilize aggregate and individual level insurance spending data and financial returns data to analyze whether medical trend can be hedged with existing assets. I separate trend into predictable and error components and analyze the correlation between the error component and return on assets. I find that medical spending growth is predictable with error over short and medium time horizons. I find that there is no significant correlation between asset returns and forecast errors across several broad asset classes. ^ The combination of partially predictable spending growth and the absence of a hedging asset imply that insurers should be using reserves to manage the macroeconomic risk of spending growth. The load for reserving for trend is an up-front cost in addition to the up-front expense of guaranteed renewability. Insurers should use a diversified investment strategy for reserves rather than one targeted at trying to match spending growth. I conclude by noting the positive and negative effects of the newly passed health reform law (PPACA) on guaranteed renewable health insurance and other health insurance arrangements that require contract reserves and policies that shift health care spending onto public plans. ...|$|R

For example, a multi-agent system architecture, entitled condition monitoring multi-agent system (COMMAS) (McArthur et al., 2004), has been applied to the ultra high frequency (UHF) monitoring of partial discharge activity inside transformers. Additionally, a multi-agent system, entitled protection engineering diagnostic agents (PEDA) (Hossack et al., 2003), has demonstrated the use of MAS technology for automated and enhanced post-fault analysis of power systems disturbances based on SCADA and digital fault recorder (DFR) data.

40|$|In {{these days}} of ever {{increasing}} competitiveness and constantly evolving markets, the way a company leverages and measures its Intellectual Capital is crucial to its success and indeed to its survival. For investors, intangible assets represent indicators of the future performance, potentialities and, at the same time, weaknesses of a firm’s business model. Although several methods for Intellectual Capital measurement and management exist, most of these methods {{are not able to}} identify and quantify the cause-effect link between Intellectual Capital management and business performance improvement. Following this lead, the paper suggests a methodology that is not meant as a substitute for existing methods, but rather proposes an integrative approach to current evaluations. A linear programming model (DEA) and the choice of inputs and outputs, properly correlated to components of the Intellectual Capital, allow us to determine the relative efficiency of an enterprise in comparison to other enterprises operating in the same business sector. Moreover, the optimal value of efficiency, that highlights a Best Practice, indicates, in term of percentage, the quantity of productive factors that an enterprise should use to become efficient. This approach offers the advantage of allowing us to make a direct comparison between firms of the same industry in the perspective of improvement through benchmarking. The paper concludes with the application of the DEA model to the evaluation of the productivity of intangible assets, trying to establish if the investments in Intellectual Capital have indeed achieved an increase in business performance significant enough to justify the sustained financial expenditure. The results show that enterprises that invest more in intangible <b>assets</b> are not <b>automatically</b> the ones that get better business performance, but there is a cause-effect relation only when an enterprise manages its intangibles optimally...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} aspect of IT security governance is the proactive and continuous identification of possible attacks in computer networks. This is complicated due to the complexity and size of networks, and {{due to the fact}} that usually network attacks are performed in several steps. This thesis proposes an approach called MsAMS (Multi-step Attack Modelling and Simulation), demonstrated by a proof-of-concept tool, to automatically find such multi-step attacks. The novelty of MsAMS is the fact that it applies Mobile Ambients and Combinatorial Optimization, more specifically Heuristic Search, to the domain of multi-step network attacks. A variant of ambient calculus is used to model networks, and heuristic search is used to simulate attackers searching for possible attacks in the modelled network. Additionally, and in support to these two aspects, MsAMS uses algorithms from the domain of Link Analysis Ranking, traditionally applied to the domain of Web search. Mobile Ambients allow us to fully represent the hierarchical topology of a network as part of the network model itself. This is essential to relate insights gained from the model to the real network. Furthermore, we can represent dynamics of attacks such as credential theft, what increases the spectrum of possibilities available for attackers since it allows considering non-vulnerable as well as vulnerable hosts as attack steps. Optimization allows managing the complexity of the problem of finding multi-step attacks involving credentials without compromising the scalability of the approach for practical use. Therefore, the MsAMS approach comprises: (i) a formal representation of the solution which allows its automatic computation, in our case, the representation of an attack step in a notation based on Mobile Ambients, (ii) a search engine which implements a heuristic method for composing attack steps into multi-step attacks, and (iii) fitness functions used by the search engine for the selection of attack steps among alternatives, according to automatically computed metrics. Similar to search engines that use the structure of the World Wide Web to score webpages, the MsAMS approach proposes the use of the structure of a network to score network assets. In particular, MsAMS uses PageRank and HITS ranking schemes as sources of scalable metrics to: 1. assign <b>asset</b> value <b>automatically</b> to all ambients represented in the network, based on network connectivity rather than on financial value, providing an absolute and comparable view of asset value. Those values support the network administrator in the process of selecting a target. 2. assign a cost value automatically to all ambients represented in the network, also based on network connectivity rather than on financial value, providing an absolute and comparable view of cost for attack steps. Such a measure of cost allows the incorporation of rationality to the ambient-attacker which simulates a strategy of a real-attacker...|$|R
