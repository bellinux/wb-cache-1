5|$|Another model {{suggests}} humans {{attempt to}} achieve {{all of their}} needs and aspirations via seven modalities: economy, community, occupational groups, government, environment, culture, and physiology. From the global to the individual human scale, {{each of the seven}} modalities can be viewed across seven hierarchical levels. Human sustainability can be <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> attaining sustainability in all levels of the seven modalities.|$|E
5|$|Another viable use {{of custom}} allocators is for {{debugging}} memory-related errors. This could be <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> writing an allocator that allocates extra memory {{in which it}} places debugging information. Such an allocator {{could be used to}} ensure that memory is allocated and deallocated by the same type of allocator, and also provide limited protection against overruns.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage can be <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> {{different}} methods, described below. Most of {{the methods}} contribute to crypsis, helping to hide against a background; but mimesis and motion dazzle protect without hiding. Methods may be applied {{on their own or}} in combination.|$|E

5|$|Contraceptive use in {{developing}} countries is estimated to have decreased the number of maternal deaths by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% of deaths if the full demand for birth control were met.

5|$|During the {{four-year}} program, many firsts in spaceflight were <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the two nations, {{including the first}} American astronaut to launch aboard a Soyuz spacecraft, the largest spacecraft ever to have been assembled {{at that time in}} history, and the first American spacewalk using a Russian Orlan spacesuit.|$|E
5|$|Early {{suggestions}} were to show cutaways {{of just a}} {{small portion}} of the audience, but the full effect was <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> only showing the back of the audience. To save time, most of the audience models were borrowed from the previous Pixar film, Ratatouille. Additionally, Presto's body (from the neck down) is Skinner's lawyer, and the carrot was one of the many food props from that film.|$|E

5|$|Enzymes must bind their {{substrates}} {{before they}} can catalyse any chemical reaction. Enzymes are usually very specific as to what substrates they bind and then the chemical reaction catalysed. Specificity is <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> binding pockets with complementary shape, charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics to the substrates. Enzymes can therefore distinguish between very similar substrate molecules to be chemoselective, regioselective and stereospecific.|$|E
5|$|For comparison, {{the next}} highest totals of Test double {{hundreds}} are Kumar Sangakkara's 11 in 223innings (4.9%), Brian Lara's 9 in 232innings (3.9%), and Wally Hammond's 7 in 140innings (5%); the next {{highest rate of}} scoring Test double centuries was <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> Vinod Kambli, whose 21 innings included 2 double centuries (9.5%).|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} T.felleus {{have a high}} {{capacity}} to accumulate radioactive caesium (137Cs) from contaminated soil, a characteristic attributed to the deep soil penetration <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the mycelium.

5|$|Human {{beings are}} seen as a {{microcosm}} of the universe, and for example comprise the Wu Xing in form of the zang-fu organs. As a consequence, it is believed that deeper understanding of the universe can be <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> understanding oneself.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Bradman {{converted}} 41% of his centuries into double centuries: {{his total}} of 12Test double hundreds—comprising 15% of his innings—remains the most <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> any Test batsman and was accumulated {{faster than any}} other total.|$|E
