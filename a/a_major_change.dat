5|$|<b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>change</b> in the {{development}} process of Perl 5 occurred with Perl 5.11; {{the development}} community has switched to a monthly release cycle of development releases, with a yearly schedule of stable releases. By that plan, bugfix point releases will follow the stable releases every three months.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>change</b> {{was made}} in the way overfulfillment was rewarded. Progressive piece-rates, where rates {{increased}} as outputs grew, were ended, and workers were paid a one-off bonus upon overachieving a quota. Where bonus rates were retained for each percentage of overfulfillment, they were capped. For example, in engineering, bonuses could not exceed 20 percent of their normal earnings.|$|E

40|$|During the 1970 s, Italy {{experienced}} an impressive compression of wage differ-entials, {{similar to the}} better-known situation in Sweden. Most evidence sug-gests that this compression {{came to a stop}} around 1982 - 83, coincident with <b>a</b> <b>major</b> institutional <b>change</b> (in the form of the escalator clause in Italian union contracts), <b>a</b> <b>major</b> economic <b>change</b> (the slowdown in inflation), <b>a</b> <b>major</b> tech-nological <b>change</b> (industrial restructuring and the computer revolution), and <b>a</b> <b>major</b> political <b>change</b> (the loss of support for unions and their egalitarian pay policies). There is some slight evidence of a reopening of differentials since then, but the evidence is uneven, and, even where a reopening is apparent, the degree of inequality is still generally below the level of the early- to mid- 1970 s. In this paper, we analyze the evolution of wage differentials across skill and occupation levels and individual characteristics in Italy for workers employed in the regular sector of the economy: workers who are not self-employed, hav...|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>change</b> in the {{training}} programme occurred in 1943. From that point on training concentrated more on the assault infantry role and less on raiding operations. Training now included how to call for fire support from artillery and naval gunfire, and how to obtain tactical air support from the Allied air forces. More emphasis was put on joint training, with two or more Commando units working together in brigades.|$|E
5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>change</b> could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait until after the election, but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E
5|$|By moving {{ice hockey}} game indoors, the smaller {{dimensions}} of the rink initiated <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>change</b> from the outdoor version of the game, limiting organized contests to a nine-man limit per team. Until that time, outdoor games had no prescribed number of players, the number being {{more or less the}} number that could fit on a frozen pond or river and often ranged in the dozens. The nine-man per side rule would last until the 1880s, when it was reduced during the Montreal Winter Carnival Hockey Tournament to seven per side.|$|E

5|$|Pupae {{have the}} ability to enter facultative diapause, the state of arrested {{development}} and growth in response to a change in the environment. By preparing themselves for <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>change</b> in environmental conditions, they can increase reproductive success. Diapause increases with increasing latitude. In tropical conditions, populations breed continuously, and only 2-4% of pupae diapause. In subtropical and temperate regions, most individuals diapause. Individuals who don't enter diapause in these areas emerge in late fall and die without reproducing. Drought-responsive diapause has also been observed in the summer.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the U-boats in the mid-Atlantic and their withdrawal, meant the Bay of Biscay became {{congested}} with German submarines seeking refuge. Thus, AOC Slessor revisited the interdiction strategy which had been tried, and failed in 1941 and 1943. This time, there were crucial differences. Firstly, the improvement of radar had enhanced detection of submarines, submerged and surfaced, and intelligence breakthroughs, in which the British Ultra organisation had broken the naval Enigma codes and confirmed <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>change</b> in German strategy, enabled the British {{to focus on the}} Biscay.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>change</b> from The Two Towers is the {{interactive}} {{nature of the}} game environments. The player can operate machinery, for example bridges and catapults, to complete objectives, and use environmental objects as weapons, such as spears and cauldrons, to kill enemies. The levels are also {{twice the size of}} the largest level from The Two Towers and many are less linear. Unlike The Two Towers, The Return of the King features a co-op mode, allowing two players to play through the game together. The North American PlayStation 2 version also has an online multiplayer mode, with USB headset support, although this was removed from the European version of the game.|$|E

Under the complex reorganization that accompanied reversion, Headquarters, IX U.S. Army Corps, was transferred from Okinawa and collocated with Headquarters, U.S. Army Japan, to form Headquarters, U.S. Army, Japan/IX Corps, at Camp Zama, Japan. There, its responsibilities included administrative oversight of US forces as well as conducting training and exercises with US and other units in the region. On Okinawa, Headquarters, U.S. Army, Ryukyu Islands, and Headquarters, 2d Logistical Command, were inactivated.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s and 1980s, severe power shortages, strikes, and {{a violent}} Naxalite {{movement}} damaged {{much of the}} state's infrastructure, leading to a period of economic stagnation. The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 resulted in the influx of millions of refugees to West Bengal, causing significant strains on its infrastructure. The 1974 smallpox epidemic killed thousands. West Bengal politics underwent <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>change</b> when the Left Front won the 1977 assembly election, defeating the incumbent Indian National Congress. The Left Front, led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), governed the state {{for the next three}} decades.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Fort Lewis, Washington was {{notified}} of <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>change</b> of structure. A corps headquarters {{was to be}} activated in March 1982. I Corps was formally activated on 1 October 1981, much earlier than expected. On 1 August 1983, the corps expanded its operational control of active Army units outside Fort Lewis, to include the 7th Infantry Division at Fort Ord, California, and the 172nd Infantry Brigade in Alaska, which then {{became part of the}} 6th Infantry Division. In 1988, the distinctive unit insignia was approved for the corps. This was the fourth design held by the corps, with previous versions being approved then retracted in 1942, 1970, and 1982.|$|E

While we cannot definitively distinguish among the relative influences of institutions, market forces, technology and politics on the evolution of earnings inequality in Italy, our analysis of skill level wage differentials and our comparisons at the individual level with the more laissez-faire system of the United States suggest that both inflation and egalitarian wage-setting institutions have importantly influenced Italian wage compression in the regular sector of the economy. Yet, this very compression may well have contributed to the flight away from the regular sector of the economy {{at both ends of the}} skill distribution, plausibly leading to a greater overall degree of inequality for the whole economy than is apparent from our analysis of wage differentials in the regular sector. ...|$|R

New York City and Madrid also obtained very positive evaluations, while Moscow was considered the weakest bid. On the same day, New York City's bid suffered a major setback following the report that the State of New York refused to fund West Side Stadium, a New York 2012 centrepiece.

5|$|The {{period between}} c. 500 and 1300 saw <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>change</b> in diet that {{affected}} most of Europe. More intense agriculture on an ever-increasing acreage {{resulted in a}} shift from animal products, like meat and dairy, to various grains and vegetables as the staple of the majority population. Before the 14th century bread was not as common among the lower classes, especially in the north where wheat was more difficult to grow. A bread-based diet became gradually more common during the 15th century and replaced warm intermediate meals that were porridge- or gruel-based. Leavened bread was more common in wheat-growing regions in the south, while unleavened flatbread of barley, rye or oats remained more common in northern and highland regions, and unleavened flatbread was also common as provisions for troops.|$|E
5|$|The riots caused <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>change</b> in the government's {{approach}} to racial issues, {{and led to}} the introduction of an aggressive affirmative action policy strongly favouring the Malays, the New Economic Policy (NEP). The National Culture Policy, also introduced in 1970, emphasised an assimilation of the non-Malays into the Malay ethnic group. However, during the 1990s Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad rejected this approach, with his Bangsa Malaysia policy emphasising a Malaysian instead of Malay identity for the state. During the 2000s decade politicians began stressing ketuanan Melayu again, and publicly chastised government ministers who questioned the social contract.|$|E
