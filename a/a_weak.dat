The side chain can make an amino acid <b>a</b> <b>weak</b> acid or <b>a</b> <b>weak</b> base, and a hydrophile if the side chain is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar. The chemical structures of the 22 standard amino acids, along with their chemical properties, are described more fully in the article on these proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We study when a {{topological space}} has <b>a</b> <b>weaker</b> {{connected}} topology. Various sufficient and necessary conditions are given for a space to have <b>a</b> <b>weaker</b> Hausdorff or regular connected topology. It is {{proved that the}} property of a space of having <b>a</b> <b>weaker</b> Tychonoff topology is preserved {{by any of the}} free topological group functors. Examples are given for non-preservation of this property by “nice ” continuous mappings. The requirement that a space have <b>a</b> <b>weaker</b> Tychonoff connected topology is rather strong, but we show {{that it is difficult to}} construct spaces which would contain no infinite subspaces with <b>a</b> <b>weaker</b> connected T...|$|R
