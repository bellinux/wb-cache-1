50|$|In {{database}} systems, atomicity (or atomicness; from Greek atomos, undividable) {{is one of}} the ACID transaction properties. An atomic transaction is an indivisible and irreducible {{series of}} database operations such that either <b>all</b> occur, <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> occurs. A guarantee of atomicity prevents updates to the database occurring only partially, which can cause greater problems than rejecting the whole series outright. As a consequence, the transaction cannot be observed to be in progress by another database client.

25|$|When a {{crayfish}} {{is held by}} its carapace {{either in}} the water or in the air, it does not respond with a tail flip when it receives sensory stimuli that would normally elicit the response. This inhibitory behavior {{does not seem to}} be mediated by the abdomen. When the thorax-abdomen junction is severed, the inhibitory effect is lost and the LGI in severed abdomen generates strong spikes since its threshold had decreased substantially. This is an indication that the behavior is mediated in the brain or the thorax of the crayfish. Most non-giant and MGI tail flips are also suppressed by restraint, so only a few non-giant systems are active to allow the crayfish to carefully wriggle free. The setup of this system seems to be designed to prevent the unnecessary use of <b>all</b> <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> tail flips or ineffective tail flips when the situation requires more careful maneuvering.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{international}} release of <b>All</b> <b>or</b> <b>Nothing,</b> the inserts for the American {{version of the}} album explicitly attributed the vocals to Morvan and Pilatus. This prompted singer Charles Shaw to reveal in December 1989 {{that he was one}} of the three actual singers on the album and that Pilatus and Morvan were impostors. Farian reportedly paid Shaw $150,000 to retract his statements, though this did not stem the tide of public criticism. Because of growing public questioning as to who sang in the group, as well as the Morvan and Pilatus' demand to Farian that they be allowed to sing on the next album, Farian confessed to reporters on 12 November 1990 that Morvan and Pilatus did not sing on the records. As a result of American media pressure, Milli Vanilli's Grammy was withdrawn four days later.

In a lecture delivered in Paris before the Cercle du Saint-Simon on 27 January 1883, Renan argued that conversion played a significant role in the formation of the Jewish people, stating that:This conversion of the kingdom of the Khazars has a considerable importance regarding the origin of those Jews who dwell in the countries along the Danube and southern Russia.
