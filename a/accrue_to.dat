5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because the benefits from it <b>accrue</b> <b>to</b> people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly <b>accrue</b> <b>to</b> me. To put it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E
5|$|The Rights of Men indicts monarchy and {{hereditary}} distinctions {{and promotes}} a republican ideology. Relying on 17th- and early 18th-century notions of republicanism, Wollstonecraft maintains that virtue {{is at the}} core of citizenship. However, her notion of virtue is more individualistic and moralistic than traditional Commonwealth ideology. The goals of Wollstonecraft's republicanism are the happiness and prosperity of the individual, not the greatest good for the greatest number or the greatest benefits for the propertied. While she emphasizes the benefits that will <b>accrue</b> <b>to</b> the individual under republicanism, she also maintains that reform can only be effected at a societal level. This marks a change from her earlier texts, such as Original Stories from Real Life (1788), in which the individual plays the primary role in social reform.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Detroit and Hull's army wounded American morale, and {{eliminated}} the main American {{force in the}} area as a threat, {{while at the same}} time boosting morale among his own forces. Brock took the American supplies at Detroit and used them for his own forces, particularly the ill-equipped militia. Under prize regulations, a substantial part of the value of the captured military stores would <b>accrue</b> <b>to</b> him. (If he had lived longer, he could have settled his debts.) Brock valued the captured ordnance supplies at £30,000. Finally, the victory secured the support of Tecumseh and the other chiefs in his confederation, who took Brock's actions as both a sign of competence and a willingness to take action.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the problem of turnover intention among the administrative personnel in a Private Faith-Based higher institution, Southwest Nigeria, focusing on the fringe benefits <b>accrued</b> <b>to</b> them and fringe benefits not <b>accrued</b> <b>to</b> them. Given this, the study investigated the comfortability of the administrative officers working with inadequate fringe benefits. It also investigated factors that make administrative officers prone to voluntary turnover and gender composition of the affected personnel. The questionnaire was used to collect information from respondents (N= 231). Drawing from data retrieved from records, the study came out with 14 fringe benefits <b>accrued</b> <b>to</b> the administrative staff and 14 fringe benefits not <b>accrued</b> <b>to</b> them.

25|$|Minimize free riding: Free riding {{occurs when}} members do less work {{because some of}} the {{benefits}} <b>accrue</b> <b>to</b> others. As others contribute ideas, individuals may feel less motivated to work hard themselves. They see their own contributions as less necessary or less likely to have much impact. To eliminate these effects, it is important to make group members feel that their contributions are essential for the group’s success. Additionally, it is less likely for someone to free-ride if they are in a small group.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many other}} types of social category, in Judaism the mamzer status is {{hereditary}} - a child of a mamzer (whether mother or father) is also a mamzer. However, since these rules are regarded as applying only to Jews, and since traditional Rabbinical law regards being a Jew as something which is only maternally inheritable, {{the child of a}} male mamzer and a non-Jewish woman cannot be a mamzer. Notably, the child of a female mamzer and a non-Jewish man is an ordinary Jew, because both parents must be Jews in order for mamzer status to <b>accrue</b> <b>to</b> the child, but the child does inherit Jewish status from the mother.|$|E
25|$|The metaphor {{illustrates}} {{the argument that}} free access and unrestricted demand for a finite resource ultimately reduces the resource through over-exploitation, temporarily or permanently. This occurs because the benefits of exploitation <b>accrue</b> <b>to</b> individuals or groups, each of whom is motivated to maximize use of the resource to the point in which they become reliant on it, while {{the costs of the}} exploitation are borne by all those to whom the resource is available (which may be a wider class of individuals than those who are exploiting it). This, in turn, causes demand for the resource to increase, which causes the problem to snowball until the resource collapses (even if it retains a capacity to recover). The rate at which depletion of the resource is realized depends primarily on three factors: the number of users wanting to consume the common in question, the consumptiveness of their uses, and the relative robustness of the common.|$|E
25|$|Fiscal {{efficiency}} is separate from economic efficiency. Economic analysis of recycling {{does not include}} what economists call externalities, which are unpriced costs and benefits that <b>accrue</b> <b>to</b> individuals outside of private transactions. Examples include: decreased air pollution and greenhouse gases from incineration, reduced hazardous waste leaching from landfills, reduced energy consumption, and reduced waste and resource consumption, {{which leads to a}} reduction in environmentally damaging mining and timber activity. About 4,000 minerals are known, of these only a few hundred minerals in the world are relatively common. Known reserves of phosphorus will be exhausted within the next 100 years at current rates of usage. Without mechanisms such as taxes or subsidies to internalize externalities, businesses may ignore them despite the costs imposed on society. To make such nonfiscal benefits economically relevant, advocates have pushed for legislative action to increase the demand for recycled materials. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has concluded in favor of recycling, saying that recycling efforts reduced the country's carbon emissions by a net 49 million metric tonnes in 2005. In the United Kingdom, the Waste and Resources Action Programme stated that Great Britain's recycling efforts reduce CO2 emissions by 10–15 million tonnes a year. Recycling is more efficient in densely populated areas, as there are economies of scale involved.|$|E

500|$|Much {{speculation}} {{appeared in}} the press as {{to the cause of}} Ellen's illness; some linked the case to that of Sarah Jacob, a girl from Wales who, her parents claimed, was able to survive without nourishment, through divine intervention. Sarah died of starvation in 1869, and her parents were subsequently convicted of manslaughter. A journalist for The Observer commented, [...] "It is to be hoped that [...] is known in the obscure village of Turville, where—we are asked to believe—a fresh case of miraculous trance has taken place.... very much... incites suspicion of deliberate imposture." [...] One correspondent to The Times wrote, [...] "It is by widespread publicity that such cases are multiplied, {{and it is difficult to}} overstate the harm thus done. These impostures exist through a morbid love of sympathy on the part of the children, or from the gains that <b>accrue</b> <b>to</b> the parents. Once begun, they soon pass into real disease." [...] Another said the [...] "ridiculous mystery" [...] could be resolved if only Ellen were transferred, over her mother's continued objections, to a London hospital, a sentiment echoed by many. Claims that Ellen was suffering from a form of catalepsy—a condition at the time considered [...] "so rare that not one physician in a thousand has so much as seen a single case of it"—were also disregarded as unlikely, as was any thought of religious ecstasy.|$|E
