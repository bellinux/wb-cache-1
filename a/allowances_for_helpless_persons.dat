25|$|Ordinary {{income is}} a net income concept, {{meaning that it}} will be {{deduction}} for costs incurred to acquire income. There is therefore a deduction for expenses related to acquisition of income if these are higher than the basic allowance. There is also several other deductions from ordinary income; special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> disability, special tax <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> pensioners, the tax limitation rule for the disabled, seamen’s allowance, fishermen’s <b>allowance,</b> special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> self-employed within agriculture, special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> high expenses linked to illness, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> payments to individual pension schemes, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> travel between home and work, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> donations to voluntary organisations, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> paid union fees, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> home investment savings scheme for people under 34 years, parental <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> documented expenses for childminding and childcare, etc.|$|R

Identified in court as [...] "B.", she was convicted by the Jerusalem District Court in 2009 on three counts of abuse of a minor or <b>helpless</b> <b>person</b> and 25 counts of assault in aggravated circumstances, and sentenced to four years in prison. Her husband, identified in court as [...] "M." [...] was also convicted of 10 counts of assault and three counts of abuse of a minor or <b>helpless</b> <b>person,</b> {{and was sentenced to}} six months in jail. After being sentenced to prison, Keren was succeeded as leader of the group by Bracha Benizri, who adopted the shawl out of concern for [...] "the deteriorating state of modesty in the ultra-Orthodox community," [...] according to her husband Rabbi David Benizri, who reportedly claims that there are close to 30,000 women wearing the shawl in Israel.|$|R

5000|$|... "There are {{at least}} four {{situations}} in which the failure to act may constitute breach of a legal duty. One can be held criminally liable: first, where a statute imposes a duty to care for another; second, where one stands in a certain status relationship to another; third, where one has assumed a contractual duty to care for another; and fourth, where one has voluntarily assumed the care of another and so secluded the <b>helpless</b> <b>person</b> as to prevent others from rendering aid.|$|R
30|$|In {{the pilot}} ETSs in China, a {{majority}} of <b>allowances</b> are allocated <b>for</b> free, with a relatively small portion being auctioned in Shenzhen and Guangdong. Grandfathering is applied to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> cogeneration units in Guangdong, and benchmarking is adopted to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> coal-fired and gas-fired units in Shanghai. As China has a steadily growing economy, a benchmarking method based on actual output (rather than historical output) is planned to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> generation companies in the national level ETS, in order to balance emission reduction and economic growth.|$|R

50|$|The rate {{at which}} patent {{applications}} are allowed can vary significantly from one technology to another. US patent applications {{in the field of}} electrical connectors, for example, get one <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> every two rejections. Business method patent applications, however, only get one <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> every 20 rejections.|$|R
30|$|Third, auctions {{should be}} {{introduced}} into the <b>allowance</b> allocation <b>for</b> takers. In China, Guangdong is the first and currently the only pilot province to introduce auctions into the allowance allocation. After the first pilot year (July 2013 –July 2014), the compliance rate of enterprises and the allowance on CO 2 emissions reduction achieved 98.90 and 99.97  %, respectively. In the Guangdong industrial sectors, the enterprises must acquire a 3  % allowance through auction, and they can then activate a 97  % <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> free; for large public buildings, 100  % are allocated for free by benchmarking before the compliance period. At present, the government-allocated <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the enterprises is free in Beijing. However, the CET will eventually be completely adjusted by the market, {{as is the case}} for CET in the EU (European Union). Specifically, a certain level of auction, such as 3  %, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the takers; and a lesser amount for auction, which should be smaller than the proportion of auction in the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the takers, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the givers; alternatively, 100  % can be free <b>for</b> the <b>allowance</b> of the givers.|$|R

5000|$|Emissions allocation: Under the Clear Skies Act, {{emission}} allowances are to {{be allocated}} based on historical fuel consumption, what {{is often referred to}} as [...] "grandfathering". Under the Clean Air Planning Act, a grandfathering approach is used to allocate emission <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> SO2, but <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> NOx, mercury, and CO2, are allocated using an output-based scheme. Under this approach, referred to as a generation performance standard (GPS), generators are given <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> each unit of electricity they generate. The number of <b>allowances</b> allocated <b>for</b> each unit of generation changes each year as the total generation from covered sources changes. The use of a GPS dampens the electricity price impacts of the bill but raises overall compliance costs.|$|R
