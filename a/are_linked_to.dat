5|$|Pancreatic cancer rarely occurs {{before the}} age of 40, {{and more than half of}} cases of {{pancreatic}} adenocarcinoma occur in those over 70. Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes, and certain rare genetic conditions. About 25% of cases <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> smoking, and 5–10% <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> inherited genes. Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed by a combination of medical imaging techniques such as ultrasound or computed tomography, blood tests, and examination of tissue samples (biopsy). The disease is divided into stages, from early (stageI) to late (stageIV). Screening the general population has not been found to be effective.|$|E
5|$|About 1500 genes <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> {{outcomes}} in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These include both unfavorable genes, where high expression {{is related to}} poor outcome, for example C-Met and MUC-1, and favorable genes where high expression is associated with better survival, for example the transcription factor PELP1.|$|E
50|$|AP-5 is {{the most}} {{recently}} described complex, and one reason supporting {{the idea that it}} is an authentic adaptor complex is that it is associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia, as is AP-4. AP-1 <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> MEDNIK syndrome. AP-3 <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. COPI <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> an autoimmune disease. COPII <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia.One of the GGA proteins may be involved in Alzheimer's disease.|$|R
50|$|Himeji Station <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> Bantan Railway (Bantan Tetsudō), {{the present}} day Bantan Line, in 1894. Kishin Line <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the station in 1930.|$|R
5000|$|... "Alevi" [...] is {{generally}} explained as referring to Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad. The name represents a Turkish {{form of the}} word ‘Alawi (علوي) [...] "of or pertaining to Ali", just as the word Musevi <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> Musa (Moses), Isevi <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> Isa (Jesus) and Mevlevi <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> Mevlana (Rumi).|$|R
5|$|Focal {{seizures}} {{begin in}} one hemisphere {{of the brain}} while generalized seizures begin in both hemispheres. Some types of seizures may change brain structure, while others appear to have little effect. Gliosis, neuronal loss, and atrophy of specific {{areas of the brain}} <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> epilepsy but it is unclear if epilepsy causes these changes or if these changes result in epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog carries {{recessive}} piebald alleles {{that produce}} {{white in the}} coat and skin and <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> congenital hereditary deafness, though {{it is possible that}} there is a multi-gene cause for deafness in a dog with the piebald pigment genes. Around 2.4% of Cattle Dogs in one study were found to be deaf in both ears and 14.5% were deaf in at least one ear.|$|E
5|$|The railway has two tracks (partly {{located in}} Rome, outside the gateway), {{but only one}} is served by a station platform. Two {{terminal}} load tracks, for freight wagons, are situated on the northeast side of the building. They <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the main track that ends in a headshunt in a tunnel.|$|E
50|$|Prolonged optical {{exposure}} to sunlight, especially intense ultraviolet light, may <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> cortical cataracts, {{and high levels}} of visible light may <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> macular degeneration.|$|R

50|$|Lane <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> Ewalt by DNA on his knife. He <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> Brooks similarly. He also dropped some gloves {{with his}} DNA {{and one of}} his victim's blood.|$|R
5|$|The reserve {{was created}} to protect fifteen plants of {{regional}} interest and three plant communities listed in the Habitats Directive. Its flora <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> calcium present in marl. It {{is located in a}} transition zone between the oceanic and semi-continental climates and that gives increased biodiversity, with typical species of the atlantic areas and others more continental. The reserve also plays a role in a wildlife corridor.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), {{who work on}} cases called X-Files, which <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the paranormal. When Mulder and Scully {{investigate}} a mysterious crash site, they find that the official reports of the incident may be covering up the crash of a UFO. Meanwhile, Mulder meets a ufologist who he believes may be a former abductee.|$|E
5|$|Other nude Hindu goddesses {{who might}} have {{inspired}} Chhinnamasta are the malevolent war goddess Kotavi and the South-Indian hunting goddess Korravai. Kotavi, sometimes described as a Matrika ("mother goddess"), is nude, dishevelled, wild, and awful in appearance. She is mentioned in the scriptures Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana, often as a foe of the god Vishnu. The ferocious, wild Korravai is the goddess of war and victory. Both goddesses <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> battlefields; Chhinnamasta is not. Kinsley points out that while there are several bloodthirsty, nude, and wild goddesses and demonesses in Hindu mythology, Chhinnamasta is the only goddess who displays the shocking self-decapitation motif.|$|E
50|$|The paint sludge has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> {{contamination}} {{of food and}} water sources with lead and benzene. The contamination has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> nosebleeds, leukemia, and other ailments among the community.|$|R
50|$|The Pfkfb2 gene {{encoding}} PFK2/FBPase2 protein <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the {{predisposition to}} schizophrenia. Furthermore, {{the control of}} PFK2/FBPase2 activity <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> heart functioning and the control against hypoxia.|$|R
5000|$|A Val-to-Met {{substitution}} at residue 175, {{leading to}} reduced PEMT activity, has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. [...] This substitution has also <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> increased frequency of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.|$|R
5|$|The Appaloosa is an American horse breed {{best known}} for its {{colorful}} spotted coat pattern. There is a wide range of body types within the breed, stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history. Each horse's color pattern is genetically the result of various spotting patterns overlaid on top of one of several recognized base coat colors. The color pattern of the Appaloosa is of interest to those who study equine coat color genetics, as it and several other physical characteristics <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the leopard complex mutation (LP). Appaloosas are prone to develop equine recurrent uveitis and congenital stationary night blindness; the latter has been linked to the leopard complex.|$|E
5|$|The banknote's obverse {{features}} {{the portrait of}} {{the first president of}} Singapore, Yusof bin Ishak, and the reverse contain secondary themes that <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> his life. The background on the obverse of the Portrait Series feature a different cowrie (sea snail whose shell was often used as currency) for each denomination. Signatories include BCCS chairman (and former Finance Minister) Richard Hu, Prime Minister (and former Finance Minister) Lee Hsien Loong, former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Deputy Prime Minister and MAS chairman (also current Finance Minister) Tharman Shanmugaratnam.|$|E
5|$|The first season, {{starring}} Matthew McConaughey, Woody Harrelson, Michelle Monaghan, Michael Potts, and Tory Kittles, {{takes place}} in Louisiana and follows a pair of Louisiana State Police homicide detectives, and their pursuit of a serial killer over a 17-year period. The second season, starring Colin Farrell, Rachel McAdams, Taylor Kitsch, Kelly Reilly, and Vince Vaughn, is set in California, and focuses on three detectives from three cooperating police departments and a criminal-turned-businessman as they investigate a series of crimes they believe <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> {{the murder of a}} corrupt politician.|$|E

5000|$|If rearing with a rider <b>is</b> {{not clearly}} <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> fear, disobedience or aggression, it may <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> pain. An equine {{veterinarian}} can examine the horse's mouth and teeth, back, and feet for possible causes. Pain may also <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> poorly fitted or improperly used tack. A rider or saddle-fitting specialist can determine if pain <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> a poorly fitted saddle, or a broken saddle tree. The fit {{and severity of}} the bit {{can also lead to}} rearing.|$|R
50|$|Anonymous {{computer}} communication {{has also}} <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> accentuate self-stereotyping. Although it has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> notable effects in gender differences, {{only when the}} topic bears similarity and fits with the gender stereotype.|$|R
5|$|The {{phonology}} {{of words}} {{has proven to}} be beneficial to vocabulary development when children begin school. Once children have developed a vocabulary, they utilize the sounds that they already know to learn new words. The phonological loop encodes, maintains and manipulates speech-based information that a person encounters. This information is then stored in the phonological memory, a part of short term memory. Research shows that children's capacities in the area of phonological memory <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> vocabulary knowledge when children first begin school at age 4–5 years old. As memory capabilities tend to increase with age (between age 4 and adolescence), so does an individual's ability to learn more complex vocabulary.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{concept of}} ecosystem {{can be traced}} back to 1864 in the published work of George Perkins Marsh ("Man and Nature"). Within an ecosystem, organisms <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the physical and biological components of their environment to which they are adapted. Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form self-organizing patterns across different scales of time and space. Ecosystems are broadly categorized as terrestrial, freshwater, atmospheric, or marine. Differences stem from the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each. A more recent addition to ecosystem ecology are technoecosystems, which are affected by or primarily the result of human activity.|$|E
5|$|While {{prohibited}} drugs are generally {{viewed as being}} the most dangerous, the misuse of prescription drugs <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> more deaths in several countries. Cocaine and heroin combined caused fewer deaths than prescriptions drugs in the United Kingdom in 2013, and fewer deaths than prescription opiates alone in the United States in 2008. As of 2015 the drug most likely to cause fatal overdose in Australia was diazepam (Valium). While fatal overdoses are highly associated with drugs such as opiates, cocaine and alcohol, deaths from other drugs such as caffeine are extremely rare.|$|E
50|$|The {{absence of}} {{glaciation}} could <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> {{the intensity of}} cosmic ray flux, and {{it is believed that}} periods of glaciation may <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> periods with low cosmic ray flux due fluctuations in solar wind variations. Another possible cause is the rate of star formation in the Milky Way. The reduced rate in star formation may <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> diminished glaciations from 1 to 2 Ga.|$|R

5|$|A pair of towers {{stand on}} the river's edge a short {{distance}} on either side from the main building. They were originally two-storyed open-backed structures with gun platforms situated on their first floors, providing flanking fire down {{the line of the}} ditch around the castle's perimeter. They were later adapted for use as accommodation, with their backs closed with bricks and the towers increased in height to provide a third storey. Traces of the gun embrasures can still be seen {{at the point where the}} original roofline was. The South Tower was said to have been for the use of the castle's governor, though their lack of comfort meant that successive governors declined to live there. The two towers <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the main building by a crenallated curtain wall where additional cannon were emplaced in two embrasures on the north parapet and one on the south.|$|E
5|$|Brushstrokes {{series is}} the name {{for a series of}} {{paintings}} produced in 196566 by Roy Lichtenstein. It also refers to derivative sculptural representations of these paintings that were first made in the 1980s. In the series, the theme is art as a subject, but rather than reproduce masterpieces as he had starting in 1962, Lichtenstein depicted the gestural expressions of the painting brushstroke itself. The works in this series <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> those produced by artists who use the gestural painting style of abstract expressionism made famous by Jackson Pollock, but differ from them due to their mechanically produced appearance. The series is considered a satire or parody of gestural painting by both Lichtenstein and his critics. After 1966, Lichtenstein incorporated this series into later motifs and themes of his work.|$|E
5|$|Having {{discovered}} a lost briefcase in a park, Tintin returns {{it to its}} owner, the sigillographer Professor Hector Alembick, who informs the reporter of his plans {{to travel to the}} Balkan nation of Syldavia. Tintin discovers secret agents spying on him and follows those responsible to a nearby Syldavian restaurant. An unknown man agrees to meet with Tintin, but is found unconscious. Shortly after, the reporter receives a threatening note and is then the target of a bomb attack; but survives the latter when police detectives Thomson and Thompson intercept the bomb. Suspecting that these events <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> Syldavia, Tintin decides to accompany Professor Alembick on his forthcoming visit to the country. On the plane journey there, Tintin notices Alembick acting out of character, and suspects that an imposter has replaced him. Reading a brochure on Syldavian history, Tintin theorises that the imposter is part of a plot to steal the sceptre of the Medieval King Ottokar IV from the current King Muskar XII before St. Vladimir's Day, thus forcing him to abdicate.|$|E

40|$|Benign {{familial}} infantile seizures are an {{autosomal dominant}} epilepsy disorder that {{is characterized by}} convulsions, with onset at age 3 to 12 months and a favorable outcome. Benign familial infantile seizures have <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> chromosome 19 q, whereas infantile con-vulsions and choreoathetosis syndrome, in which benign familial infantile seizure is associated with paroxysmal choreoathetosis, has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> chromosome 16 p 12 -q 12. Many additional families from diverse ethnic backgrounds have similar syndromes that have <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the chromosome 16 infantile convulsions and choreoa-thetosis syndrome region.
