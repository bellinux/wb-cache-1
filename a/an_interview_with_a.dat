Guests {{come from a}} wide range of {{cultural}} sources, and include actors, musicians, authors, athletes, pundits, policy experts and political figures.

An American war crimes investigator for the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Special Agent John Cencich, corroborated the information in <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high-level inside witness linking Slobodan Milošević, then president of Serbia to the killings. The ICTY charged Milošević with the deaths of 32 civilians in Voćin. Milošević was subsequently arrested and tried, but he died before his trial was completed. The ICTY also charged Šešelj with involvement in the forced deportation of non-Serb civilians from Voćin. Šešelj was ultimately acquitted of all charges.|$|E
