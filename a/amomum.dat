Lay down the Lydian carpets for the king. The king should pace on purple to his bride, And music there to greet my lord the king. [...] [Music. (To Phoebe). Dost thou {{remember}} when I wedded Sinnatus? Ay, thou wast there--whether from maiden fears Or reverential love for him I loved, Or some strange second-sight, the marriage cup Wherefrom we make libation to the Goddess So shook within my hand, that the red wine Ran down the marble and lookt like blood, like blood.|$|E
6000|$|Some of {{the chiefs}} had copper rings of home manufacture, with neatly cut raised figures. The king {{held in his}} right hand an article which at first puzzled us--a foot's length of split reed, with the bulbous root attached. He may not, like his vassals, point with the finger, and without {{pointing}} an African can hardly give an order. Moreover, the Sangálávú or Malaguetta pepper (<b>Amomum</b> granum Paradisi), fresh or old, is not only a toothstick, but a fetish of superior power when carried on journeys. Professor Smith writes [...] "Sangala woo," [...] and tells us that it was always kept fresh in the house, to be rolled in the hands when invoking the Fetish during war-time; moreover, it was chewed to be spat at the enemy. Possibly he confuses it with the use as a tooth-stick, the article which Asia and Africa prefer to the unclean hog's- bristle brush of Europe.|$|E
60|$|Patriotic Barbot (1700), {{in company}} with the mariner Villault de Belfons, Père Labat, and Ernest de Fréville, [Footnote: Mémoire sur le Commerce Maritime de Rouen.] claims the honour for France. According to that 'chief factor for the African Company,' the merchants of Dieppe first traded to West Africa for {{cardamoms}} and ivory. This was {{during the reign of}} Charles V., and between 1364 and 1430, or half a century before the Portuguese. Their chief stations were Goree of Cape Verde, Sierra Leone, Cape Mount, the Kru or Liberian coast, then called 'of Grain,' from the 'Guinea grains' or Malaguetta pepper (<b>Amomum</b> granum Paradisi), and, lastly, the Gold Coast. Here they founded 'Petit Paris' upon the Baie de France, at 'Serrelionne;' 'Petit Dieppe,' {{at the mouth of the}} St. John's River, near Grand Bassá, south of Monrovia; and 'Cestro' [Footnote: Now generally called Grand Sestros, and popularly derived from the Portuguese cestos--pepper.] or 'Sestro Paris,' where, three centuries afterwards, the natives retained a few words of French. Hence Admiral Bouet-Willaumez explains the Great and Little 'Boutoo' of our charts by butteau, from butte, the old Norman word still preserved in the great western prairies.|$|E
