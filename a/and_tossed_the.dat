5|$|The next {{match was}} the {{submission}} match between champion Bret Hart and challenger Bob Backlund, with the aforementioned stipulation {{being that the}} only way to win the match was to have the opposing cornerman (either Owen Hart or Davey Boy Smith) throw in the towel. Bret got the early advantage and wore down Backlund using head locks, but Backlund broke free and attempted a crossface chickenwing on Bret. Bret escaped, but Backlund maintained the advantage by attacking Bret's arm and attempting another crossface chickenwing. Bret used a figure four leglock on Backlund, but Backlund got out of the hold. Bret then applied the Sharpshooter, his signature hold, on Backlund. Owen entered the ring and clotheslined Bret from behind, causing him to break the hold, and exited the ring. Smith then chased Owen around the ring, but fell and was kayfabe knocked unconscious on the ring steps. While Bret was distracted, Backlund applied the crossface chickenwing. Owen looked on in disbelief at what was happening to Bret and went to the ringside area, where their parents Stu and Helen Hart were sitting. Owen begged them to throw Bret's towel in to the ring to save him as Backlund kept the hold locked in for what would eventually total nine and a half minutes. Stu refused to do so, not trusting Owen's motives, but Helen overruled him <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> towel into the ring. Owen then ran into the ring and showed the referee Bret's towel, and the match and championship were awarded to Backlund as Owen took off backstage holding the towel over his head triumphantly, saying later that this Thanksgiving would be the best ever due to him having finally cost Bret the WWF World Heavyweight Championship after trying and failing to do so himself.|$|E
25|$|Curry (#7) {{advanced}} to the Millsaps 43-yard line, near the Trinity sideline. Staving off a would-be tackle by Millsaps safety Ray Kline (#1) with his left arm, Curry leapt <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> ball backwards with his right. It was caught by offensive lineman Josh Hooten (#50).|$|E
25|$|This was {{the first}} Super Bowl to be {{televised}} in the United States by ABC, joining the annual broadcasting rotation of the game with CBS and NBC. It {{was also the first}} time that the sitting U.S. president participated in the coin toss ceremony; Ronald Reagan appeared live via satellite from the White House <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> coin. This Super Bowl was unique in that it fell on the same day that he was inaugurated for a second term; because Inauguration Day (January 20) fell on a Sunday, Reagan was sworn in privately and the public ceremony took place the following day. It was also only the second Super Bowl in the game's history in which one of the teams could have been considered to actually have had home-field advantage, as Stanford Stadium was located in the 49ers' home market -- just 30 miles from San Francisco proper and the 49ers' then-home stadium, Candlestick Park. Super Bowl XVIII, the previous Super Bowl, and Super Bowl XIX became the only time the winning teams have scored the same number of points on consecutive Super Bowls (the Los Angeles Raiders scored 38 points as well in their victory over the Washington Redskins).|$|E

500|$|Abby's {{small size}} {{resulted}} in its effects being limited to areas within the immediate track. Sustained winds of 45mph (75km/h) with gusts to 65mph (100km/h) were {{measured by the}} Army Corps of Engineers in Matagorda. Near the town, a possible tornado unroofed a barn <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> structure this building previously had withstood the effects of Hurricane Carla in 1961. Winds estimated at [...] tore part of the roof off a fishing warehouse in Matagorda itself. Along the coast, tides ranged from [...] above normal from Matagorda to Freeport. Four men and five dogs required rescue after their vessel became stranded on the Colorado River.|$|E
500|$|Carroll's first season, 1994, started well. Going into a November {{home game}} against Miami, the Jets were 6–5; {{a victory over}} the Dolphins would tie them for the AFC East lead. The Jets built leads of 17–0 and 24–6, but Dan Marino and the Dolphins cut the lead to 24–21 and got the ball for a final-minute drive. Marino {{completed}} a pass into Jets territory with just over 30 seconds remaining. With the clock running, the Dolphins acted like Marino would spike the ball to stop the clock. However, Marino faked the spike <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> ball to Mark Ingram {{in the end zone}} for the winning touchdown. The loss started yet another December collapse; the Jets would not win again {{for the rest of the}} season. Prior to the season finale, the Jets announced that Steinberg was ill with stomach cancer; he died the following September. The team fired Carroll after the season and replaced him with former Philadelphia Eagles coach Rich Kotite. [...] Hess also named Kotite as general manager as well.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1976, Herzog visited Plainfield again, this time to shoot part of his film Stroszek. After the {{shooting}} finished, Herzog handed Morris an envelope with cash in it.

2500|$|Brownlow {{endorsed}} Ulysses S. Grant {{for president}} in 1868, and asked for federal troops to be stationed in 21 Tennessee counties to counter rising Klan activity. The state legislature granted him the power to throw out entire counties' voter registrations if he thought they included disfranchised voters. In October 1868, prior to the election, Brownlow discarded all registered voters in Lincoln County. [...] Following the election, two of the Radicals' congressional candidates, Lewis Tillman in the 4th District and William J. Smith in the 8th District, were initially defeated. [...] Brownlow, believing Klan intimidation to be the reason for their defeat, tossed the votes from Marshall and Coffee counties, allowing Tillman to win, <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> votes from Fayette and Tipton counties, allowing Smith to win.|$|E
