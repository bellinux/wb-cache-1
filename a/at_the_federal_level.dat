40|$|There exist several {{financial}} {{authorities that}} guide public sector accounting and financial management in Nigeria. Despite this, there is {{low level of}} accountability and transparency in financial reporting and management <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government <b>level</b> which engenders {{a high level of}} corruption. Curiously, two basic questions are: To what extent have these financial authorities been effective in enhancing accountability and transparency in public fund management? Secondly, are the financial authorities adequate? This paper therefore, determines the effectiveness and adequacy of the existing financial authorities. With a robust literature review providing the theoretical framework, it uses primary data collected from a sample of 200 federal public/civil servants and a student t-distribution statistic at 95 % confidence level, to test two hypotheses: “That financial authorities guiding public sector accounting and financial management <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government <b>level</b> in Nigeria are ineffective in enhancing accountability and transparency in public fund management”, and, “That the financial authorities guiding public sector accounting and financial management <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government <b>level</b> are inadequate”. The result shows that the financial authorities are both ineffective and inadequate. It thus strongly recommends a substantial review of the existing laws, rules and regulations that guide public sector accounting and financial management <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government <b>level</b> in Nigeria, a strengthening of the legal process not only to include very punitive sanctions but als...|$|R
