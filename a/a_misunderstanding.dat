Supergirly, which consisted of Louise McClatchy and Jai Simeone, (known as Lou and Jai) would feature in sketches throughout the morning as BBC make-up artists who were rude to the guests, either through <b>a</b> <b>misunderstanding,</b> by being tactless or by mistaking the guests as someone else. The sketches would usually culminate with the guests storming off.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, the {{definition}} kept Pluto as a planet. Pluto's planetary status {{was and is}} fondly thought of by many, especially in the United States since Pluto was found by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, {{and the general public}} could have been alienated from professional astronomers; there was considerable uproar when the media last suggested, in 1999, that Pluto might be demoted, which was <b>a</b> <b>misunderstanding</b> of a proposal to catalog all trans-Neptunian objects uniformly.|$|E
5|$|Despite Lee's {{hope for}} an early start, it took all morning to arrange the {{infantry}} assault force. Neither Lee's nor Longstreet's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet, describing it either as <b>a</b> <b>misunderstanding</b> of Lee's verbal order or a mistake. Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet's Gettysburg performance by the postbellum Lost Cause authors cite this failure as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee's plan for the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Indonesian {{literary}} scholar Ajip Rosidi {{writes that}} the vast majority of the stories in Kawan Bergeloet are meant as comedy.

5|$|A German {{officer who}} escaped {{reported}} that the German prisoners were being humanely treated, but when Böhme {{became aware of the}} situation, he decided that retaliation was needed. He ordered III.Battalion of the 749th Infantry Regiment, part of the 717th Infantry Division, to burn down Gornji Milanovac and take hostages in order to expedite the recovery of the captured German troops. Due to <b>a</b> <b>misunderstanding</b> by the battalion commander, the unit did not burn down the town on 6October, and released the 170hostages it had arrested. Böhme was furious, and, on 15October, he sent the same battalion back to Gornji Milanovac to carry out his original orders. This was done on 16October.|$|E

5|$|F. During the series, it was {{revealed}} that the Victoria club had not filed a formal challenge. A letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, stating that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees. However, on March 18, Trustee William Foran stated that it was <b>a</b> <b>misunderstanding.</b> PCHA president Frank Patrick had not filed a challenge, because he had expected Emmett Quinn, president of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the Victoria challenge was accepted.|$|E

Dodge {{decided to stop}} racing in NASCAR, so Pearson switched way from Owen's Dodges in favor of Holman Moody's Fords.

5|$|The first studio scene—Donna in {{the fortune}} teller's room—was filmed on 30 November 2007, on a redressed Torchwood Hub {{set at the}} show's Upper Boat Studios. The outdoor scenes in Shan Shen—comprising Tennant's entire {{contribution}} to the episode—were filmed on 1 December 2007 in Splott and near the Cardiff Royal Infirmary. The shoot was marred by difficulties: rain delayed redressing the alley from the hanzi banners and posters to the Bad Wolf versions; and several extras left at lunchtime because of <b>a</b> <b>misunderstanding</b> over their payment. The final scene filmed on the day was the Doctor's examination of the Time Beetle in the fortune teller's room.

5|$|The {{theory has}} been rebuffed {{medically}} as suggestions that porphyria sufferers crave the haem in human blood, or that the consumption of blood might ease the symptoms of porphyria, are based on <b>a</b> <b>misunderstanding</b> of the disease. Furthermore, Dolphin was noted to have confused fictional (bloodsucking) vampires with those of folklore, {{many of whom were}} not noted to drink blood. Similarly, a parallel is made between sensitivity to sunlight by sufferers, yet this was associated with fictional and not folkloric vampires. In any case, Dolphin did not go on to publish his work more widely. Despite being dismissed by experts, the link gained media attention and entered popular modern folklore.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Peel {{was very}} popular and admirers often entertained him socially; he became {{well known for}} liking alcohol. On {{the morning of the}} match that England won after {{following}} on, Peel was intoxicated and had to be sobered up. In 1897, he was suspended by Yorkshire for drunkenness during a match. Although it is unclear what exactly happened—Peel said he slipped when fielding, but Hirst later recalled that he came on the field drunk and when asked to leave, bowled a ball in the wrong direction—he never played for the county again. Decades later, a widely circulated story suggested that Peel urinated on the pitch before being sent away. Historians consider the story unlikely, and attribute it to <b>a</b> <b>misunderstanding</b> by its reporter. Peel continued to play and coach cricket {{for most of his life}} and in later years became associated with Yorkshire once again. Among his other jobs, he became the landlord of a public house and worked in a mill. He died in 1941 at the age of 84.|$|E
