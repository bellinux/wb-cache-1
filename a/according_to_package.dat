40|$|The {{stability}} of {{extra virgin olive}} oil in polyethylene terephthalate bottles and tinplate cans stored for 6 months under dark and light conditions was evaluated. The following analyses were carried out: free fatty acids, peroxide value, specific extinction at 232 and 270 nm, chlorophyll, L*C*h color, total phenolic compounds, tocopherols and squalene. The physicochemical changes were evaluated by artificial neural network (ANN) modeling with respect to light exposure conditions and packaging material. The optimized ANN structure consists of 11 input neurons, 18 hidden neurons and 5 output neurons using hyperbolic tangent and softmax activation functions in hidden and output layers, respectively. The five output neurons correspond to five possible classifications <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>packaging</b> material (PET amber, PET transparent and tinplate can) and light exposure (dark and light storage). The predicted physicochemical changes agreed very well with the experimental data showing high classification accuracy for test (> 90 %) and training set (> 85). Sensitivity analysis showed that free fatty acid content, peroxide value, L*C-ab*h*(ab) color parameters, tocopherol and chlorophyll contents were the physicochemical attributes with the most discriminative power.

40|$|The {{microbial}} spoilage of beef was monitored during storage at 5 °C {{under three}} different conditions of modified-atmosphere packaging (MAP) : (i) air (MAP 1), (ii) 60 % O 2 and 40 % CO 2 (MAP 2), and (iii) 20 % O 2 and 40 % CO 2 (MAP 3). Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae, Brochothrix thermosphacta, and {{lactic acid bacteria}} were monitored by viable counts and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis during 14 days of storage. Moreover, headspace gas composition, weight loss, and beef color change were also determined at each sampling time. Overall, MAP 2 was shown {{to have the best}} protective effect, keeping the microbial loads and color change to acceptable levels in the first 7 days of refrigerated storage. The microbial colonies from the plate counts of each microbial group were identified by PCR-DGGE of the variable V 6 -V 8 region of the 16 S rRNA gene. Thirteen different genera and at least 17 different species were identified after sequencing of DGGE fragments that showed a wide diversity of spoilage-related bacteria taking turns during beef storage in the function of the packaging conditions. The countable species for each spoilage-related microbial group were different <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>packaging</b> conditions and times of storage. In fact, the DGGE profiles displayed significant changes during time and depending on the initial atmosphere used. The spoilage occurred between 7 and 14 days of storage, and the microbial species found in the spoiled meat varied <b>according</b> <b>to</b> the <b>packaging</b> conditions. Rahnella aquatilis, Rahnella spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Carnobacterium divergens were identified as acting during beef storage in air (MAP 1). Pseudomonas spp. and Lactobacillus sakei were found in beef stored under MAP conditions with high oxygen content (MAP 2), while Rahnella spp. and L. sakei were the main species found during storage using MAP 3. The identification of the spoilage-related microbiota by molecular methods can help in the effective establishment of storage conditions for fresh meat...|$|R

40|$|In the diploma thesis Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) is {{used for}} {{labeling}} individual products. It {{is based on the}} usage of radio waves. In the supply chain, RFID technology could replace a barcode labeling because {{it has a lot of}} advantages like: easier and faster reading on large distances, storing data on RFID tags, identification of larger number of objects at the same time and others. There exist many different RFID systems available for identification that include RFID readers, tags and antennas for capturing data. For its commercialisation in supply chain EPCglobal IncTM standardisation organization is responsible. It operates under the auspices of GS 1 (The Global Language of Business). The purpose of RFID standards is to ensure global connectivity of components in RFID systems. The work consisted of introduction and testing of labeling different food products with RFID labels. We divided them into several groups <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>packaging</b> forms and ingredients.

40|$|Purpose - Increasing {{load factor}} {{is crucial for}} {{transport}} efficiency and may benefit shippers because of its potential to reduce both environmental impact and transportation costs. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore how shippers can increase load factor in their road transport by identifying opportunities for logistics action and influences on load factor performance measures created by such opportunities. Design/methodology/approach - A case study is performed of the outgoing goods flow from the central warehouse of a large retailer in Sweden. Data are collected from interviews with the shipper and its contracted freight forwarder, as well as from archival sources and visual observations, and applied to produce a framework. Findings - Logistics actions that can increase load factor are identified and categorised <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>packaging</b> efficiency, loading efficiency and booking efficiency, all of which are linked to logistics variables and specific performance measures in the framework. Visual observations of volumetric load factor in vehicles indicate room for improvement via, for example, making lead times more flexible. Practical implications - The framework's principles can be used to support shippers in finding opportunities to increase load factor. Originality/value - The framework clarifies the concept of load factor as a whole by explaining each logistics action's contribution to increasing load factor, as well as the actions' combined effect in the context of a shipper and its purchased transport share. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited...|$|R
