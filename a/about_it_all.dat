25|$|In So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish (published in 1984), Arthur {{returns home}} to Earth, rather {{surprisingly}} {{since it was}} destroyed when he left. He meets and {{falls in love with}} a girl named Fenchurch, and discovers this Earth is a replacement provided by the dolphins in their Save the Humans campaign. Eventually he rejoins Ford, who claims to have saved the Universe in the meantime, to hitch-hike one last time and see God's Final Message to His Creation. Along the way, they are joined by Marvin, the Paranoid Android, who, although 37 times older than the universe itself (what with time travel and all), has just enough power left in his failing body to read the message and feel better <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> before expiring.|$|E

500|$|From {{the text}} itself, the ending is ambiguous: {{according}} to one view, Batman breaks the Joker's neck out of panel, causing the laughter to stop abruptly. Some people theorise that the title, [...] "The Killing Joke" [...] is {{in reference to the}} ending scene, in which The Joker and Batman laugh, over a joke, thus triggering Batman to kill The Joker. According to another view, Batman and the Joker, who have been fighting for years, end all of their disputes by having a good laugh <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> Still another theory maintains that the first and last panels of the book are both purposely of rain falling on the ground, which symbolizes that nothing has changed except for the two parties' respect for each other.|$|E

500|$|He was a cricket enthusiast, {{taking his}} bat {{with him when}} {{evacuated}} during the Blitz. In 1971, he told Mel Gussow: [...] "one of my main obsessions in life is the game of cricket—I play and watch and read <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the time." [...] He {{was chairman of the}} Gaieties Cricket Club, a supporter of Yorkshire Cricket Club, and devoted a section of his official website to the sport. One wall of his study was dominated by a portrait of himself as a young man playing cricket, which was described by Sarah Lyall, writing in The New York Times: [...] "The painted Mr. Pinter, poised to swing his bat, has a wicked glint in his eye; testosterone all but flies off the canvas." [...] Pinter approved of the [...] "urban and exacting idea of cricket as a bold theatre of aggression." [...] After his death, several of his school contemporaries recalled his achievements in sports, especially cricket and running. [...] The BBC Radio 4 memorial tribute included an essay on Pinter and cricket.|$|E
500|$|... "The End of All Things" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} David Fury, while being directed by [...] veteran, Jeff Hunt. It was Hunt's third series credit (his other two being [...] "The Man from the Other Side" [...] and [...] "The Box"). Leading up to the episode's broadcast, executive producer Jeff Pinkner remarked {{in a conference call}} with journalists that it was a [...] "game-changer" [...] because [...] "our characters learn a lot more and the audience is going to learn a lot more about the über-plot of the season’s bad guy, David Robert Jones." [...] Referring to the Observer September, Pinker added that the episode would also peel [...] "back some layers about what his agenda has been and use that as an opportunity to revisit the things on the show we’ve seen before." [...] Fellow executive producer J.H. Wyman elaborated [...] "We always said you would find out about the Observers this season {{and we were going to}} investigate them a lot more. We’re excited <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> That’s a highlight– the Observers are a highlight. For us to constantly break what you know and reset and have people go, 'Wow, I didn’t see that coming!' That’s why we get up in the morning is to take people along for the ride. We’re excited about what’s coming up, too." ...|$|E
500|$|After Hershiser reached 49 {{consecutive}} innings {{because of}} what some sources describe as an umpire's favorable interference ruling on a double play, the sports media compared him to Drysdale, who had a similar incident occur during his streak. The Houston Chronicle noted that both beneficial calls were in Dodgers–Giants games. However, the press also noted that Hershiser needed another complete game shutout to tie Drysdale and pass Johnson on the all-time consecutive scoreless innings list. In addition to covering the record pursuit, some sportswriters perceived that Hershiser had taken a commanding lead in the Cy Young Award race. Despite the official ruling by MLB statistician Seymour Siwoff that only full innings of starting pitchers count toward the record, some of the press continued {{to refer to the}} record as [...] innings. The pennant race also continued to draw attention as the Dodgers closed in on the NL West division title. An Associated Press article noted that it was Hershiser's eighth consecutive complete game and fifteenth of the season and Hershiser's fifth consecutive complete game shutout. As Hershiser's last remaining start approached, the media mentioned that he needed one more complete game shutout to tie the all-time record. When the total reached 49, Hershiser first began to feel that the record was within reach. Not only were his teammates too superstitious {{to talk to him about}} the streak, Dodgers announcer Drysdale also avoided the subject when talking to Hershiser for fear of jinxing him. Hershiser was not superstitious about the record, saying, [...] "I'm pretty loosey-goosey about it... I talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the time. I'm not superstitious." ...|$|E

500|$|Hopkins was {{generally}} expected to reprise his Academy Award-winning role. Hopkins did say in June 1999 {{that he would}} only be interested if the script was [...] "really good". Hopkins says on the making-of feature on DVD that he couldn’t {{make up his mind}} to commit. [...] "I was kind of surprised by this book, Hannibal. I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn’t make up my mind <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about." [...] When the producers confirmed {{that they were going to}} film Harris' novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: [...] "It needs some condensing." [...] The Hollywood Reporter would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest [...] of the script by Steven Zaillian. Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into [...] "Lecter's mind". [...] "I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, 'Do I repeat that same performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed so I changed a bit." [...] In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient. This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone. Hopkins explains why: [...] "It's as if he's making a statement—'catch me if you can'. With his big hat, he's so obvious that nobody thinks he's Hannibal Lecter. I've always thought he's a very elegant man, a Renaissance man." [...] In the film, Lecter is first seen in Florence [...] "as the classical Lecter, lecturing and being smooth", according to Hopkins. When the film moves to the U.S., Hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short [...] "to make him like a mercenary, that he would be so fit and so strong that he could just snap somebody in two if they got... in his way".|$|E

I think <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the time, there's so many things that I want to sing, melodies, and lyrics.

Linehan also said that, being a special event, the musical would need to focus on a [...] "world-shaking" [...] story, possibly with Ted becoming Pope due to [...] "some weird succession thing". In June, Linehan said that he hoped The Divine Comedy frontman Neil Hannon, who wrote the show's music, would return to compose the songs.|$|E
2500|$|Penned scripts for Ricky's exit in April 2000 {{had to be}} rewritten {{to account}} for the absence of Mike Reid who played Ricky's father Frank. The storyline {{initially}} planned to have Frank and Ricky involved in one of EastEnders renowned two-hander episodes, but due to Reid's off-screen ill-health, Steve McFadden, who plays Phil Mitchell, had to stand in for the episode, which saw Ricky flee Walford. [...] Of his departing episode, Owen stated that he was pleased Ricky's final scenes featured just him and Phil (Steve McFadden). He comments, [...] "both Phil and Ricky have had babies, broken marriages and loads of ups and downs in their lives, and it was good to talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in that episode.

2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "“The Bear and the Bow” {{is a really}} {{compelling}} episode for Once Upon a Time, and I admit that I wasn’t necessarily expecting it to be. However, the separate trajectories towards heroism and self-confidence for both Merida and Gold were genuinely engrossing... The plot (The deception from Arthur) thickens, and it didn’t feel like {{part of the same}} episode {{as the rest of the}} story, considering how singularly focused it is on the Gold/Merida arcs. But it was necessary if next week’s episode is going to kick off the search for this mysterious person. So I can’t really complain <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> in all, I thought “The Bear and the Bow” delivered, as Once Upon a Time continues what is gradually becoming one of my favorite first-halves of any season in some time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1996, Westbrook's axing was {{reported}} in the press. According to press reports, producers had tired of her off-screen antics and were angered that she had appeared on the Channel 4 chat show, The Girlie Show, and had given away the outcome of a storyline she was involved with, a love-triangle between Sam, Ricky and his new girlfriend Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). The character departed for Spain on 26 March 1996 after falling for a Spanish tourist. Westbrook has since commented, [...] "The producers were very nice <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> Rather than killing [...] off they sent her to Spain, once again leaving the door open for her to return [...] There was no official line as to why I was leaving, and when the announcement was made [...] they were kind enough to let me say in interviews that I was going because I wanted 'a change of direction'. 'Hopefully, one day I'll return to the show', I told journalists".|$|E
2500|$|Regional media {{immediately}} {{picked up}} the lawsuit, {{and members of the}} research team were shocked when they found out <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> of the scientists named in the suit were adamant that they never coerced Genie, maintaining that Genie's mother and her lawyers grossly exaggerated the length and nature of their testing, and denied any breach of confidentiality. While David Rigler was giving his deposition he discovered that Jean Butler Ruch had goaded Genie's mother into suing, and in an interview several years later the lawyers who worked with Genie's mother confirmed Ruch heavily influenced the actions of Genie's mother throughout the course of the lawsuit. According to author Russ Rymer, the suit was settled in 1984. However, in 1993 David Rigler wrote, [...] "he case never came to trial. It was dismissed by the Superior Court of the State of California 'with prejudice,' meaning that because it was without substance it can never again be refiled." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kipling sympathised {{with the}} anti-Home Rule stance of Irish Unionists, who opposed Irish autonomy. He was friends with Edward Carson, the Dublin-born leader of Ulster Unionism, who raised the Ulster Volunteers to prevent Home Rule in Ireland. Kipling {{wrote in a}} letter to a friend that Ireland was not a nation, and that before the English arrived in 1169, the Irish were a gang of cattle thieves living in savagery and killing each other while [...] "writing dreary poems" [...] <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> In his viewpoint, it was only British rule that allowed Ireland to advance. A visit to Ireland in 1911 {{confirmed}} Kipling's prejudices as he wrote the Irish countryside was beautiful but was spoiled by what he called the ugly homes of the Irish farmers, with Kipling adding that God had made the Irish into poets because he had [...] "deprived them of love of line or knowledge of colour".

2500|$|The game {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Official Xbox Magazine called it [...] "A decent upgrade or {{introduction to the}} series". GameSpot noted [...] "This movie trivia game offers consistent multiplayer fun despite its limited feature set". IGN stated [...] "Scene It? Bright Lights! Big Screen! gets a few things right that a trivia game should — the clips are plentiful, the round with the edited photos is fun, and there's {{a fair amount of}} questions here — but the things it misses sink any shot this game had at being something you need to play". GameZone commented [...] "Scene It? features plenty of movie trivia factoids to keep cinemaphiles happy, but a dearth of features (no online play?!?) and the availability of other, better trivia games for PlayStation 3 makes me doubt that this was ever intended for the big screen to begin with". In contrast, Game Revolution cited [...] "Scene It? can only be entertaining — not to mention, fair — if everyone playing not only has comparable movie knowledge but also comparable gaming experience, which is completely ridiculous for a casual party game. And the thing that's so irritating <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> is that these problems could have been fixed with almost zero effort".|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, Haggard {{recorded}} [...] "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive," [...] {{also written}} by Liz Anderson {{with her husband}} Casey Anderson, which became his first number-one single. When the Andersons presented the song to Haggard, they were unaware of his prison stretch. Bonnie Owens, Haggard's backup singer and then-wife, is quoted by music journalist Daniel Cooper in the liner notes to the 1994 retrospective Down Every Road: [...] "I guess I didn't realize how much the experience at San Quentin did to him, 'cause he never talked <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> that much.... I {{could tell he was}} in a dark mood ... and I said, 'Is everything okay?' And he said, 'I'm really scared.' And I said, 'Why?' And he said, 'Cause I'm afraid someday I'm gonna be out there ... and there's gonna be ... some prisoner ... in there the same time I was in, stand up—and they're gonna be about the third row down—and say, 'What do you think you're doing, 45200?'" [...] Cooper notes that the news had little effect on Haggard's career: [...] "It's unclear when or where Merle first acknowledged to the public that his prison songs were rooted in personal history, for to his credit, he doesn't seem to have made some big splash announcement. In a May 1967 profile in Music City News, his prison record is never mentioned, but in July 1968, in the very same publication, it's spoken of as if it were common knowledge." ...|$|E
