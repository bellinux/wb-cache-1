40|$|A {{provocation}} by Michael Pinchbeck and Linford Butler, University of Lincoln, {{given at}} Where From Here: 21 Years of Third Angel symposium at Leeds Beckett University on Thursday 17 th November 2016. This provocation seeks {{to remember what}} is was like to watch Third Angel’s Presumption both live onstage <b>in</b> 2007 (Pinchbeck) <b>and</b> on DVD <b>in</b> 2016 (Butler). Both speakers seek to provide a reasonable basis for belief or acceptance <b>that</b> something changed <b>in</b> their understanding of what devised theatre could be <b>and</b> do <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> of watching a room being built. Their encounters with the work unravel different dramaturgical threads around its original devising, for example, using ‘text as a tool’ and ‘moving objects around the stage’, citing Alex Kelly and Chris Thorpe’s dialogue in Duska Radosavljevic’s The Contemporary Ensemble: Interviews with Theatre-makers (2013). Finally, the speakers draw on their own research into the dramaturgy of contemporary (Pinchbeck) and DIY (Butler) performance, citing Pinchbeck’s interviews with Third Angel on his Outside Eye Project blog, where Kelly describes ‘building the room’ as both a literal and metaphorical part of the devising process...|$|R

I fully share Chomsky’s doubts about the real consequences of Obama’s victory: From a pragmatic-realistic perspective, {{it is quite possible}} that Obama will just do some minor face-lifting improvements, turning out to be “Bush with a human face. ” He will pursue the same basic politics in a more attractive mode and thus effectively even strengthen U. S. hegemony, which has been severely damaged by the catastrophe of the Bush years. There is nonetheless something deeply wrong with this reaction — a key dimension is missing in it. It is because of this dimension that Obama’s victory is not just another shift in the eternal parliamentary struggles for majority with all their pragmatic calculations and manipulations. It is a sign of something more. This is why a good, American friend of mine, a hardened Leftist with no illusions, cried for hours when the news came of Obama’s victory.

40|$|For {{patients}} a hospital visit {{is a profound}} experience influenced by their mental <b>and</b> physical state <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment.</b> Various aspects of the hospital environment {{play a role in}} their experience. For most patients communicating about this expe-rience in all its complexity is a difficult task. This difficulty impedes designers’ and hospital professionals’ insight into patients’ perspective on the hospital environ-ment. For this reason we are investigating how research on patient experience can in-form hospital design. In this paper, we explore more specifically (1) how insight in-to patient experience can foster an empathic and motivated understanding amongst healthcare professionals and designers, (2) what kind of information is needed to achieve this, and (3) how their improved understanding impacts on their problem solving ability. To this end, we report on a case study in collabora-tion with a general hospital, with which we organised a series of workshops about improving wayfinding. Bringing together different profiles of designers and healthcare professionals {{turned out to be an}} enrichment for all parties involved, even when working within the same organisation. Depending on their profile, participants had different ex-pectations of the format and content of the information presented during the work-shop. Although the workshop was generally evaluated positively, specific attention should be paid to raising realistic expectations about information on patient expe-rience. We found a discrepancy between what research can tell about real pa-tients’ experience, what healthcare professionals expect to learn, and what is useful for designers to work with. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{discover}} the proper style and place of Christian doctrine in adult religious education. The critical assessment {{of the work of}} three influential authors: Johannes Hofinger, John H Westerhoff III and James Michael Lee reveals that none is able to offer an adequate model for practice. Hofinger has a limited vision of both theology and education; Westerhoff too limited an understanding of education; and Lee far too narrow an understanding of theology. Consideration of the nature of Christian doctrine and its relationship to theology and the life of faith indicates that it {{is the product of a}} multi-disciplinary encounter between the gospel and the world. It is continually changing and being refined and is best understood and communicated by means of analogy. Music offers an analogy which sheds light on the Christian story. It also provides an analogy for the process of doing theology itself. It draws attention to the central importance of the encounter between the composer, the composition, the performer <b>and</b> the listener <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> of performance which is a new act of creation for each participant. This shows that God is not revealed in the un-read word of scripture, but in the present, lived encounter with the word. That encounter may be simple and direct, but it also involves a myriad of factors which together comprise the story and context of the scripture itself and of the person who reads it. It is the responsibility of the religious educator of adults to try to understand both levels of encounter. The re-making of Christian doctrine for each adult learner is a life-long process which depends upon reflection upon past learning. Its outcome is properly open-ended, but it must be continually assessed to prevent it becoming dangerously unfocussed...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the more}} complex {{problems}} which looms through all spheres of the human existence, a problem which appears {{as a result of}} the interaction of the individual with other people in a certain social environment, a problem with a long history, a problem which doesn't pass the young population, a problem very current nowadays, is the problem of the violent behaviour. In this context a subject of theoretical and empirical study, research were the factors and forms of the violent behaviour of and among the students in the primary schools in our town. Our goal was to examine whether this socially unacceptable behaviour exists and what are the forms of its appearance in the primary school, as well as to confirm which activities are undertaken by the experts, the teachers, parents, and other people involved in the work of the school for reducing, overcoming this kind of behaviour. The determination for studying this problem came from the fact that lately we get information from various sources that it is present <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> some <b>moments</b> it gets a current dimension. The main goal in our work was to go a step forward in the finding out the solutions for overcoming of this issue, which means encouraging, vigilance and responsibility of the schools in terms of their more often engagement in issues <b>in</b> this area, <b>and</b> the results from this research to be the base of the realization of further project activities...|$|R

40|$|Navigation using maps {{has been}} a ‘core skill’ of outdoor {{learning}} since it’s early days. I heard myself saying ‘I’d be lost without a map’ {{at a conference in}} Australia in conversation with local practitioners including an aboriginal national park ranger. He laughed saying ‘I always know here I am’. A Finn, an Australian <b>and</b> I decided <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> to experiment. What kind of experiences could we facilitate in the wild travelling without maps? The Finn let his students undertake a self-reliant journey across the tundra in winter. They thought it could be done in five days, might take ten and planned on fifteen. In the end it took twelve days. Using natural navigation such as the sun, stars, wind direction and river valleys as guides <b>and</b> staying <b>in</b> camp when it was a blizzard or no visibility, they headed east until they reached a catch feature, a north south road, where they were picked up. The Australian let his students loose in the bush with the rule that they must always stay on a trail. The bush was dense and the trails few, all of them bringing the group to one exit from the forest or another. The group emerged after three days and a walk they enthused about for weeks afterwards. I managed just a few hours in a Lakeland woodland. Two groups set out to create a walk with natural markers as waypoints. They then turned a description of the route into a poem that they then taught to the other group. Each group would then try to follow the path of the first group. It worked a treat – even with lines involving ‘sunlit birches in autumn colour’! – it was a day of sunny periods and birch was the dominant tree! A key for all of us was a change in our attitudes to time as a safety factor <b>and</b> to space <b>in</b> <b>that</b> we needed to know where our groups were. In each case risk assessments focussed on the skills, equipment and experience of the group so that they could mange space and time effectively for themselves. However, we also noticed a significant change {{in the nature of the}} experiences reported by the participants. The focus on nature was considerably enhanced – including noticing more and the apparent development of new knowledge, understanding, skills, behaviours and values.

40|$|This thesis imagines and articulates {{an image}} of {{architectural}} subjectivity {{in the philosophy of}} Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. Subjectivity for Deleuze does not refer to a person but is rather a power to act and to produce effects in the world. Deleuze in fact tends not to use the word subjectivity, speaking instead of what he calls prepersonal singularities, meaning those irreducible qualities or powers that can be seen to act in the world, independently of any particular person with fixed traits. To walk, to see, to love-these are general or anonymous capacities <b>that</b> function <b>in</b> a very real sense prior to the personological subject. Singular, here, does not mean specific or rare, but the reverse: the function "to sleep" or "to laugh" is singular for Deleuze because "a sleep" always retains a certain abstractness and `impersonality,' no matter who sleeps. For Deleuze, the world is composed of so many singularities, which together resonate silently towards a mystery of something yet to come; this primary field of a pure encounter transcends formed identities and things. The `subject' is understood therefore not primarily as identity but as a convergence of singularities immanent to the encounter. While to speak of the `subject' in these terms-to rid oneself of identity-is a difficult thing, we might say architecture is already such a singular encounter and deindividualisation of self. There is, as soon as I step into a room, a street, or a town, a palpable mystery of the singularity "to walk inside," "to see an unfamiliar street"; each echoing <b>and</b> anticipating <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> every other instance, past and future, of this primitive encounter. It is an anonymous sense of a primary production that lies beyond the individual, spatio-temporal experience I call "mine. " To encounter, then, does not mean an in-between, a space between persons and concrete forms; rather, it is an event that comes before the crystallisation of these things, it is the abstract surface of all singularities. I will call architectural singularities the impersonal effects, to think the inchoate, not-yet determined fragments of architectural encounter (these I oppose to the `personal' effects of identity, such as a watch, a wallet, a cigarette case). I use "effect" in Deleuze's sense of production, in which the effect is not ephemeral, an effect of something more primary, but is in itself a primary production, an effect that works, and creates. The project here is to express, by architectural means, the image of effects. Image, here, does not mean a representation, such as a photograph or a media image, but refers to a live "arrangement" of effects. What individuates an image is precisely the mode in which it causes the effects to proliferate. I begin the project with an account of Deleuze's reception in the American architectural academy, so as to reveal the historical conditions that make Deleuze's theory of subjectivity important now. Chapter Two introduces the concept of the effect and the architectural formulation <b>that</b> functions <b>in</b> the dissertation; Chapter Three extends this work in the effects-image; Chapter Four turns to Guattari's reception <b>in</b> Japan, <b>and</b> what I observe to be a pursuit after the effects-image in Guattari's encounter with architecture; finally in Chapter Five I explore the psychoanalytic lining of Guattari's project, further engaging the working of the effects-image.
