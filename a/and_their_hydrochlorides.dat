Different sets of correction factors were determined for each theory level considering the four smallest elements for the α,ω-diamines series, while <b>their</b> transferability <b>and</b> reliability was evaluated considering the larger elements of the series. The theory level simplification was also evaluated and was found to neither compromise the vibrational frequencies estimates nor the magnitude and accuracy of the pre-defined scaling factors. This suggests that transferability of the correction factors is possible not only for different diamines but also between different levels of theory with the averaged group correction factor, ζ g (a), being the best choice to account for the effects of the N-H[*]·[*]·[*]·[*]Cl interactions.

40|$|Background: In {{the field}} of {{asymmetric}} aminocatalysis, chiral catalysts derived from azoles (five-membered heterocycles containing exclusively N atoms) play an important role. Surprisingly, all the catalysts used for enamine and/or iminium ion activation derive from pyrrole or imidazole.

The azole derivatives that came naturally to mind are the 3, 5 -disubstituted 2 -pyrazolines (also called 4, 5 -dihydro- 1 H-pyrazoles). Methods: We synthesized racemic 3, 5 -diphenyl- 2 -pyrazoline, separated both enantiomers by chiral-HPLC on a Lux-Cellulose- 4 column (heptane/ethanol 70 : 30 as mobile phase), determined the absolute configuration of <b>their</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> salts (pyrazolinium) by the combined use of experimental rotatory power and B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) theoretical calculations and use one the enantiomers, the R, as the catalyst.

The information obtained from the solid state structures, combined with an investigation of the solution phase behaviour of 4 -BA. HCl(s), resulted in the determination of a kinetic model for the recovery of amine starting material. The proposed reaction scheme describes the conditions under which the dissociation of 4 -BA. HCl(s) can occur. Reaction in a closed system shows no amine production while reaction in an open system permits, within solubility limits, the complete consumption of solid waste to produce free amine. From these two extremes the conversion of waste hydrochloride salt in the industrial reactor can be rationalised. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} dissertation {{discusses the}} development of a nickel catalyst for the synthesis of Csp 2 -Csp bonds in addition to the development and mechanistic studies of nickel and palladium catalysts for the synthesis of Csp 2 -N bonds. 	The first chapter is a review of the cross-coupling reactions discussed in this dissertation. Nickel and palladium will be compared with respect to physical properties and reactivity differences. The challenges associated with nickel-catalyzed cross coupling will be illustrated, while drawing analogies to analogous palladium-catalyzed reactions. The literature background for the synthesis of Csp 2 -Csp bonds, catalyzed by palladium and palladium/copper catalytic systems, will be reviewed, while highlighting the challenges and limitations of the field. The field of Csp 2 -N bond-forming reactions will be examined, as the differences in reactivity between nickel and palladium will be emphasized. 	Chapter 2 discusses our efforts towards {{the development of}} a nickel catalyst for {{the development of a}} Csp 2 -Csp bond forming reaction, performed in the absence of a copper co-catalyst. 	Chapter 3 describes the development of a single-component nickel complex that catalyzes the coupling of aryl chlorides with primary alkylamines. A series of mechanistic experiments, including synthesis of catalytic intermediates and kinetic experiments, were performed to elucidate the mechanism of the reaction. 	Chapter 4 discusses our report the palladium-catalyzed coupling of aryl halides with 2 ̆ 028 ammonia and gaseous amines as their ammonium salts. A difference in selectivity between reactions of aryl chlorides and aryl bromides was discovered and investigated. 	Chapter 5 describes the development of a single-component nickel catalyst for the coupling of aryl chlorides with ammonia and ammonium sulfate to form the corresponding primary arylamines. The application of ammonium salts was extended to the coupling of gaseous amines, such as methylamine and ethylamine, which were subjected to the reaction conditions as <b>their</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> salt...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the synthesis of}} series of novel copper(II) complexes of bis(2 -pyridylmethyl) amine (DPA) and 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane (tacn) ligands with appended guanidinium pendants, {{and the study of}} their hydrolytic reactivity with two model phosphodiesters, bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP), 2 -hydroxypropyl-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (HPNPP), as well as supercoiled pBR 322 plasmid DNA. A comparative kinetic study indicated that the introduction of guanidinium groups, capable of acting as hydrogen-bond donors, significantly increases the hydrolytic activity of a number of metal complexes. The ligands were prepared by multi-step syntheses <b>and</b> isolated as <b>their</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> salts. The DPA derivatives bearing guanidinium pendants of varying lengths were made by reacting the corresponding N,N-bis(2 -pyridylmethyl) alkane-α,ω-diamines with 1 H-pyrazole- 1 -carboxamidine hydrochloride. Tacn-based ligand families, featuring alkyl/xylyl guanidinium pendants, were prepared following a common synthetic approach. This involved coupling of protected amino-bearing pendants to the free secondary amine group(s) of an appropriate N-protected tacn derivative, deprotection of the pendants, and subsequent conversion of the pendant amino groups to guanidinium groups via treatment with N,N′-Boc 2 - 1 H-pyrazole- 1 -carboxamidine. Global trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) -mediated Boc-deprotection yielded the final products. A family of alkyl-guanidine bridged bis(tacn) ligands was prepared following a synthetic strategy which required the formation of tacn carbamoyl thiourea derivatives <b>and</b> <b>their</b> EDC-mediated coupling to the corresponding Boc 2 tacn-alkylamines to give protected carbamoyl guanidines. Removal of the ethyl carbamate group under basic conditions, followed by Boc group removal using TFA, gave the target bis(tacn) guanidinium ligands. The perchlorate salts of copper(II) -DPA complexes were prepared by reacting the ligands with Cu(NO 3) 2 • 3 H 2 O in aqueous solution, followed by cation exchange chromatography, using aqueous NaClO 4 as the eluent. Single crystals of copper(II) -tacn complexes were isolated following addition of an equimolar amount of Cu 2 + to the tacn-based ligands in aqueous solution, and adjustment of the pH to 9. X-ray crystallographic analyses of the copper(II) -DPA complexes revealed that the DPA moieties of the ligands coordinate to the distorted octahedral copper(II) centers in a meridional fashion, with a water/methanol occupying the fourth basal position and the perchlorate anions occupying the axial positions. In contrast, Cu(II) -tacn complexes with single alkyl/xylyl guanidinium pendants, exhibited distorted square pyramidal copper(II) geometries. Interestingly, for the complexes featuring ethylguanidinium and bis(ethylguanidinium) pendants, one secondary amine nitrogen from each guanidine pendant coordinated to the copper(II) center, forming very stable five-membered chelate ring(s). The copper(II) -tacn complex with a single ethylguanidinium pendant also incorporated a single µ-hydroxo bridge between two Cu(II) -ligand units. This bridge was found to facilitate strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the Cu(II) centers. Except for the Cu(II) -tacn complex with bis(ethylguanidinium) pendants, each copper(II) complex featured labile coordination sites, an important feature when designing biomimetic model compounds for the hydrolysis of phosphate esters. The copper(II) complexes were tested for their hydrolytic activity towards the well-established model phosphodiesters, BNPP and HPNPP. In some instances, the introduction of the positively charged guanidinium pendant resulted in enhancements in the rate of phosphate ester hydrolysis compared to the parent complex, [Cu(tacn) (OH 2) 2] 2 +. This appears to be due to a combination of: (i) the pendants reducing the extent of formation of inactive dihydroxo-bridged dimers, and (ii) the guanidinium groups enhancing substrate binding and/or stabilizing transition states involved in the cleavage process. The monoalkyl-linked guanidinium complexes were the most active of those investigated, with the most active being the copper(II) complex containing the butyl spacer (at pH 7. 0, kobs values measured were 10. 2 ( 0. 9) x 10 - 6 s- 1 for BNPP cleavage at 50 ºC, and 54. 2 ( 2. 0) x 10 - 6 s- 1 for HPNPP cleavage at 37 ºC, corresponding to 6 - and 10 -times faster activity than [Cu(tacn) (OH 2) 2] 2 +). The mononuclear Cu(II) complex with two coordinated ethylguanidinium pendant arms exhibited no measurable cleavage activity towards the model substrates employed, indicating the requirement for labile ligand coordination sites. The Cu(II) complexes featuring xylyl-linked guanidinium pendant groups showed no significant enhancement in cleavage rates compared to [Cu(tacn) (OH 2) 2] 2 +, suggesting that the more rigid spacers within these complexes prohibited simultaneous interaction of the Cu(II) centers and guanidinium groups with the phosphodiester groups in BNPP and HPNPP. The binuclear copper(II) complexes with bridging guanidine groups were found to be less effective cleavage agents compared to their mononuclear counterparts. This finding is ascribed to intermolecular µ-hydroxo bridge formation between the two copper(II) centers inhibiting interactions with the model substrates employed. Assessment of plasmid pBR 322 DNA cleavage activities showed that all complexes exhibited significant nuclease activity, which was predominantly hydrolytic in nature. Kinetic analyses revealed the copper(II) complex featuring an ortho-xylyl guanidinium pendant as the most active cleavage agent (kobs = 2. 7 x 10 - 4 s- 1), representing a 3 x 107 -fold rate enhancement over the uncatalyzed cleavage reaction. This remarkable cleavage activity is proposed to be due to the charged guanidinium pendant interacting with a neighboring phosphodiester group in the DNA backbone, rather than in concert with the Cu(II) center to activate the phosphodiester linkage undergoing cleavage...|$|R

40|$|The slime mould Physarum flavicomum {{exhibits}} synchronous nuclear {{divisions and}} has been widely used to study the biochemical changes which take place on differentiation. One example of this, sporulation, {{has been shown to}} require light and the plasmodial pigments have been implicated as possible photocatalysts or photoreceptors. In order to fully understand this process it is necessary to know the chemical structure of the pigments. One pigment shows changes in absorption maxima with variations in the pH of the solution {{and has been}} called the “indicator” pigment. It is with this pigment that the present investigation is concerned. [...] The pigment was isolated and purified using a modification of the method employed Khalil. Elemental analyses gave empirical formulae of C₁₂. ₁H₁₃. ₁O₅N for the protonated pigment and C₁₁. ₂H₁₆. ₅O₇. ₂N Na and C₁₂. ₃H₁₃. ₉O₇. ₇N Na₂. ₅ for the sodium salt of the pigment. The n. m. r. spectrum agrees {{with a high degree of}} unsaturation in the pigment molecule. [...] The presence of the tetraene, identified by Khalil, was confirmed by oxidation experiments. Hydrolysis indicated the presence of a carbohydrate, possibly sorbose, and basic compounds which were isolated, by several methods, as <b>their</b> <b>hydrochlorides,</b> but were not identified. [...] Pigment isolated from frozen plasmodia had a molecular mass of approximately 1880, determined by oxidation techniques, and a low E 1 %/ 1 cm value of 200. This pigment yielded five amino acids on hydrolysis, two of which were tentatively identified as glycine and alanine. There was also evidence, on hydrolysis, of an amino sugar which was possibly glucosamine. It is suggested that this pigment contains a peptide. [...] Khalil proposed a tetraene conjugated to a 2, 4 -pyranone system to be the chromophore of the pigment. In order to investigate this possibility, compounds were synthesized by reacting triacetic acid lactone at the 3 and 6 α positions. On of the products, 4 -hydroxy- 6 -(4 -(2 -furyl) buta- 2, 4 -dienyl) - 2 H-pyran- 2 -one, had the same absorption maximum as the pigment but the hyperchromic, bathochromic shifts it displayed on acidification were not as great as those shown by the pigment. However, it does represent the best model system for the pigment available at the present time...|$|R
