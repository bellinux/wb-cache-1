40|$|This issues paper {{examines}} the current arrangements {{put in place}} by governments to support our educational attainment and particularly in post-school, in vocational education and training (VET) and higher education - as Part B of a two-part paper. More specifically and consistent with the White Paper’s Terms of Reference, it considers how the current split of roles and responsibilities, and the overlap and duplication inherent in them, is contributing to pressures on the efficiency and effectiveness of our education system, and governments’ capacity to deliver better services and educational outcomes for their citizens. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING  Introduction  The vocational education and training (VET) system plays {{a vital role in}} delivering trained individuals that have skills needed by the labour market for Australia’s economic development. While this provides significant benefits to employers and the economy, more importantly, it provides significant benefits to individuals that have obtained the skills, both in terms of their social inclusion and participation in society, but also their own future employment prospects and earning potential. VET offers students and learners the opportunity to (1) attain nationally-recognised qualifications 1 {{for a wide range of}} jobs, from entry-level occupations through to highly technical para-professions; (2) gather the skills necessary to meet regulatory or licensing requirements for many trades and occupations; and (3) pursue an educational pathway that suits their needs, either to learn basic or foundation skills to prepare for higher level qualifications or to enter the workforce, or to move on to higher education. The training system encompasses Certificate I through to a Graduate Diploma (see Appendix A). Certificate III is the central qualification for trade training, and Certificate IV generally introduces managerial competencies. However, some people choose to undertake only part of a VET qualification (known as a skill set) in order to acquire specific skills that may help them specialise or progress in the workplace. Around 3 million students a year study VET, with 1. 5 million students in government-subsidised training places, including around 400, 000 apprentices and trainees. 2 In 2013, around 240, 000 students did VET courses as part of their secondary schooling (VET in schools) which helps many of them move from school to work. VET is also an important part of Australia’s international education market with 135, 000 overseas students in 2013. Training is provided by more than 4, 6003 public, private and community providers.  In 2013, about half of all government-subsidised training was provided through Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institutes and other government providers. The rest of the subsidised training is delivered by around 2, 0005 registered training organisations that include a mix of private for- profit colleges, not-for-profit organisations such as community colleges and schools, and enterprises delivering <b>accredited</b> <b>in-house</b> training. There are around 80 education providers that are registered to deliver both VET and higher education courses, including 11 TAFE institutes and 15 universities. In addition, there is a significant amount of non-accredited training conducted each year with around 8 million Australian workers undertaking some form of adult learning. In 2014 - 15, governments will provide an estimated $ 5. 9 billion in funding for subsidised training (31 per cent of which will come from the Commonwealth). The recent opening up of government-subsidised places to private providers has seen their share of the subsidised training market increase to around one third Australia-wide, compared to about 20 per cent in ...|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{procedures}} for the reliable determination of uranium isotopes employing a commercially available high resolution (HR-) ICP-OES installed in a glove box were developed and validated. To this end, nine commonly used U emission lines were tested for their potential to provide a hyperfine splitting of the U signal, thus providing isotopic information. Among all emission lines tested, the wavelength region around 424. 4 nm offered the largest spread between individual U signals, i. e. 233 U, 235 U, 236 U, and 238 U. This study focused specifically on the reliable determination of the abundances of 235 U at 424. 412 nm and 238 U at 424. 437 nm in samples containing depleted, natural and slightly enriched U, but also included specimens with rather high (up to ~ 90 %) 235 U enrichments. Appropriate selection of the spectral background and accurate positioning of the peaks proved essential for obtaining reproducible U isotope ratios. The accuracy of the developed methodology was confirmed by the analysis of eight certified isotopic reference materials as well as eight reference samples that have been characterised in an <b>accredited</b> laboratory <b>in-house</b> using TIMS. In addition, this study highlights {{the potential of the}} developed HR-ICP-OES procedure for identifying nuclear sources of various U specimens via the analysis of 233 U (424. 398 nm) and 236 U (424. 423 nm). In contrast to the commonly used techniques, the methodology applied in this study does neither require separation of U from the matrix prior to analysis nor the regular analysis of a reference sample with a known isotopic composition to correct for bias effects as it is the case for more sophisticated and precise mass spectrometric measurements. Nevertheless, HR-ICP-OES provides U isotopic information with reasonable accuracy and precision within a few minutes. As such, HR-ICP-OES can be employed as a reliable, fast screening tool to identify the U isotopic composition and as such, complements the more laborious TIMS analysis routinely employed for this purpose.

40|$|In this work, the {{characterization}} of the radio channel for ISM 2. 4 GHz Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for judo applications is presented. The environments where judo activity is held are usually complex indoor scenarios in terms of radiopropagation due to their morphology, the presence of humans and the electromagnetic interference generated by personal portable devices, wireless microphones and other wireless systems used by the media. For {{the assessment of the}} impact that the topology and the morphology of these environments have on electromagnetic propagation, an in-house developed 3 D ray-launching software has been used in this study. Time domain results as well as estimations of received power level have been obtained for the complete volume of a training venue of a local judo club’s facilities with a contest area with the dimensions specified by the International Judo Federation (IJF) for international competitions. The obtained simulation results have been compared with measurements, which have been carried out deploying ZigBee-compliant XBee Pro modules at presented scenario, using approved Judogis (jacket, trousers and belt). The analysis is completed with the inclusion of an <b>in-house</b> human <b>body</b> computational model. Such analysis has allowed the design and development of an in house application devoted to monitor the practice of judo, in order to aid referee activities, training routines and to enhance spectator experience.

40|$|In this thesis, {{an inverse}} source {{reconstruction}} method with great potential in radome diagnostics is presented. A radome is a cover that encloses an antenna {{in order to}} protect it from environmental influences. Radome diagnostics are acquired in the design process, the delivery control, and in performance verification of repaired and newly developed radomes. A measured near or far field may indicate deviations, e. g., beam deflection, but the origins of the flaws are not uncovered. In this thesis, radome diagnostics is performed by imaging the tangential electromagnetic fields on radome surfaces, disclosing the radome influence on the electromagnetic fields as well as the positions and influences of defects. The source reconstruction is based on a surface integral representation together with the extinction theorem. The extinction theorem and its associated surface integral equation ensure that the reconstructed tangential electromagnetic fields have their sources within the radome. The presence of axial symmetry in the measurement set-up enables usage of the fast Fourier transform to reduce the computational complexity. Furthermore, the problem is solved by an <b>in-house</b> <b>body</b> of revolution method of moments (MoM) code utilizing a singular value decomposition (SVD) for regularization. The reconstruction is performed on a fictitious surface in free space, located precisely outside the physical surface of the radome, i. e., no a priori information of the material of the radome is requested. Moreover, both synthetic and measured data are used to verify the method. In Papers I-III, the measurement set-up is a reflector antenna covered by a monolithic radome, and the near field is measured on a cylindrical surface. The height of the radome corresponds to 29 - 43 wavelengths in the frequency interval 8. 0 - 12. 0 GHz. The amplitude and phase of the tangential electromagnetic fields are reconstructed on the radome surface and the influence of the radome is investigated. Moreover, the alteration of the phase due to the transmission of the radome, the insertion phase delay (IPD), is imaged. Defects in the form of square copper patches, with an edge length corresponding to 1. 6 - 2. 4 wavelengths in the considered frequency interval, are attached to the radome wall. These might {{serve as a model for}} e. g., a lightning conductor or a Pitot tube. The attached patches alter the near field, and by applying source reconstruction, the disturbances of the patches are focused and detectable. In Paper IV, the field is measured on a spherical sector in the far-field region at 10. 0 GHz. Two set-ups with dielectric defects attached to the radome surface, are investigated. The aim is to investigate if variations in the electrical thickness of the radome wall can be detected. It is concluded that it is possible to discover dielectric patches of various edge sizes (0. 5 - 2. 0 wavelengths), and with the smallest thickness corresponding to a phase shift of a couple of degrees. In Paper V, a frequency selective (FSS) radome corresponding to a height of 51 wavelengths at the frequency 9. 35 GHz is investigated. The electrical performance of an FSS radome depends on the periodic structure of the elements in the radome frame. The periodic structure of the investigated radome is disrupted by horizontal defects (vertical displacements of elements) and vertical defects (a column of missing elements). The far-field data is measured on a spherical sector, and the far-field data reveals that the radome changes the radiation properties. The tangential electromagnetic fields on the radome surface are reconstructed for several antenna illuminations to image the cause of these alterations. Furthermore, it is shown that the different components of the electromagnetic fields are affected differently by the defects, implying that both co- and cross-components of the electric and magnetic fields need to be considered. Moreover, the Poynting's vector is employed to visualize how the defects block the field from the antenna...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} an <b>in-house</b> manufactured race-car <b>body</b> for {{the annual}} Formula SAEé Series competition. The driving parameters for the design and fabrication process are examined {{with regards to the}} assignment's “format” as a joint study between architecture and engineering students. Traditionally there has been an inhibition concerning communication between architects and engineers, that is perhaps successfully exemplified through Peter Rice's example of the "Iago mentality" (Rice, 1998) where the Shakespearean confrontation between Othello and Iago is viewed as an analogy to this communication: "In the dialogue of Architecture and Engineering, the engineer is the voice of rationality and reasoni. " Unless dictated by construction necessities, research between these two disciplines is not sought as regularly as we would hope for, we are therefore, interested to assess the analog and computational techniques used from a design perspective, and, by understanding the implications of working among two different but similarly geared backgrounds, describe possible improvements on real-size projects that require both technical and design input, thereby affirming Rice's belief for creative inter-disciplinary discourse. Finally, the project is a reminder of the common ground between architectural and automotive design, by examining the notion of surface from a cross-disciplinary premise...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree of Magister of Technologiae: Human Resource Management in the Faculty of Business at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2013 Broadly speaking, employee participation is the totality of forms, either directly (personal or by employees themselves) or indirectly (through employees’ representatives) by which individuals, groups, and/or collectives secure their interests or contribute to the decision making process. Employee participation has often been heralded as a solution, if not the panacea for low institutional effectiveness, efficiency and productivity. Institutional productivity is a basic goal of management in today’s highly competitive HE institution environment. This is because higher productivity signifies that the employees are rendering services of good quality and this will attract new students. The primary objective of any public HE institution is to render services of good quality to the students (inputs) so as to produce more graduates (outputs or productivity). Employee participation in decision making beyond collective bargaining is relatively new in South African civil service. Recognizing the need to supplement CB and for South African civil service to be more competitive, the LRA of 1995 No 66 introduced the system of Workplace Forums. A Workplace Forum is an <b>in-house</b> <b>body,</b> which is intended {{for the promotion of}} participative management through consultation, cooperation, joint decision making and information sharing. This new dispensation was mainly aimed at improving the effectiveness, efficiency and productivity of South African workplaces. More so, the new dispensation also aimed to promote shop floor democracy, and to encourage power sharing in South African workplaces. However, the uptake of this new dispensation in the public HE institution for this study is slow due to the adversarial relationship between the unions in the HE institution where this study was conducted. The reality is that, there are platforms in the Faculty for this study through which employees can voice their opinions. This notwithstanding, the respondents for this study stated that this platforms are not effective because management most of the time uses its prerogatives (Executive Ruling) to decide on issues under debate for the interest of the Faculty. The fact that there is an adversarial relationship between the unions in the institution for this study and the fact also that management most of the time uses its prerogatives to ignore the inputs of the employees means that meaningful employee participation is a “show” and not “real” in the institution and Faculty where this study was conducted. This study investigates the impact of employee participation in decision making on a Faculty’s productivity. A qualitative method was employed, and face-to-face semi-structured interviews were used to collect data for this study. The data that was collected for this study was analyzed qualitatively by using themes. The overall finding shows that it is perceived that employee participation has a positive impact on the Faculty’s effectiveness, efficiency and productivity. This is because the respondents stated that they render effective and efficient services to the students because there are more than enough opportunities or platforms where they can contribute to the Faculty’s decisions and management. However, the respondents also indicated that they would be more effective, efficient and productive if the management of the Faculty should translate their inputs into practice. The study also found that employee participation {{is still in its infancy}} in the institution and Faculty owing to the three main factors below:  Lack of management commitment in the process. This is as a result of fear on the part of management to loose its managerial prerogatives and control over the Faculty; and  Lack of trade union support. This is because there is an adversarial relationship between the unions in the institution for this study; and  Lack of employees’ commitment. This is due the fact that employees see no commitment on the part of the unions in the institution and management of the Faculty for this study. In order for there to be any meaningful or effective employee participation in decision making in the institution and Faculty for this study, the above obstacles should be overcome...|$|R
