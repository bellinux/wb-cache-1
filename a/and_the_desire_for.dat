South of Antilley Road, these subdivisions mainly use two routes to enter the city, Buffalo Gap Road and US Highway 83/84, where many of these places are located. This surge of residential growth is evidence of both recent outward growth in the city <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> open spaces often exhibited by urbanites as well as suburbanites.|$|E

25|$|The {{other side}} of the war saw the causes of the quarrel {{initially}} as a constitutional issue, but as the war progressed they became more radical and religiously focused. Thus, the elements of resistance in Parliament and the nation were at first confused, and, later, strong and direct. Democracy, moderate republicanism, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> constitutional guarantees could hardly make head way against the various forces of royalism, for the most moderate men of either party were sufficiently in sympathy to admit compromise. But the backbone of resistance was the Puritan element, and this waging war at first with the rest on the political issue, soon (as the Royalists anticipated) brought the religious issue to the front.|$|E

25|$|Construction {{continues}} {{on the final}} stage of the Begin South project between Dov Yosef Boulevard and Rosmarin Street. Through the neighborhood of Beit Safafa, despite the residents' objections and requests for a tunnel, the highway will continue as a slightly depressed roadway with a 200 meter wide, park-covered bridge at al-Qa'ash St. connecting the south-west corner of the neighborhood with its center. Ongoing litigation between the residents and the municipality regarding the proximity of the highway to houses <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> additional crossing points has, as yet, not been resolved. Construction of ramps to Rosmarin Street is expected to be completed by the Spring of 2016, while the full Rosmarin Interchange with tunnels is scheduled to be completed by September, 2017.

25|$|The second Constituent Assembly {{differed}} in composition from the first. In East Pakistan, the Muslim League had been overwhelmingly {{defeated in the}} 1954 provincial assembly elections by the United Front coalition of Bengali regional parties anchored by A. K. Fazlul Huq's Krishak Sramik Samajbadi Dal (Peasants and Workers Socialist Party) and the Awami League (People's League) led by Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy. Rejection of West Pakistan's dominance over East Pakistan <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> Bengali provincial autonomy were the main ingredients of the coalition's twenty-one-point platform. The East Pakistani election and the coalition's victory proved pyrrhic; Bengali factionalism surfaced soon after the election and the United Front fell apart. From 1954 to Ayub's assumption of power in 1958, the Krishak Sramik and the Awami League waged a ceaseless battle for control of East Pakistan's provincial government.|$|E
25|$|Automobiles play a great role in American culture, {{whether it}} is in the mundane lives of private {{individuals}} or in the areas of arts and entertainment. The rise of suburbs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> workers to commute to cities brought about the popularization of automobiles. In 2001, 90% of Americans drove to work in cars. Lower energy and land costs favor the production of relatively large, powerful cars. The culture in the 1950s and 1960s often catered to the automobile with motels and drive-in restaurants. Americans tend to view obtaining a driver's license as a rite of passage. Outside of a relative few urban areas, it is considered a necessity for most Americans to own and drive cars. New York City is the only locality in the United States where {{more than half of all}} households do not own a car.|$|E

25|$|After the Reformation {{the contest}} between the {{widespread}} {{belief in the}} limited intellectual and moral capacity of women <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> women to take personal moral responsibility, particularly as wives and mothers, intensified. In Protestantism this necessitated an ability to learn and understand the catechism and even {{to be able to}} independently read the Bible, but most commentators, even those that tended to encourage the education of girls, thought they should not receive the same academic education as boys. In the lower ranks of society, women benefited from the expansion of the parish schools system that took place after the Reformation, but were usually outnumbered by boys, often taught separately, for a shorter time and to a lower level. They were frequently taught reading, sewing and knitting, but not writing. Female illiteracy rates based on signatures among female servants were around 90 per cent from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth centuries, and perhaps 85 per cent for women of all ranks by 1750, compared with 35 per cent for men. Among the nobility there were many educated and cultured women, of which Queen Mary is the most obvious example.|$|E
