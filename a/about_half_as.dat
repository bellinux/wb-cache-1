5|$|On December 19, 2012, {{evidence}} was presented that suggest {{a system of}} five planets orbiting Tau Ceti. The planets' estimated minimum masses are between two and six times the mass of Earth and their orbital periods range from 14 to 640 days. One of them, tentatively named Tau Ceti e, appears to orbit <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> far from Tau Ceti as Earth does from the Sun. With Tau Ceti's luminosity of 52% that of the Sun and {{a distance from the}} star of 0.552 AU, the planet would receive 1.71 times as much stellar radiation as Earth does, slightly less than Venus with 1.91 times Earth's. Nevertheless, some research places it within the star's habitable zone. The Planetary Habitability Laboratory has estimated that Tau Ceti f, which would receive 28.5% as much starlight as Earth, would be narrowly within the habitable zone of the star as well.|$|E
5|$|The pallid sturgeon's snout {{and head}} are {{longer than that}} of the shovelnose sturgeon. In both species, the mouth is located well back from the tip of the snout. Lacking teeth, they use their {{extendable}} mouths to suck up small fish, mollusks, and other food sources from river bottoms. Both species also have four barbels which descend from the snout near the front of the mouth. The barbels are believed to be sensory features to locate food sources. On pallid sturgeon, the two inner barbels are <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> long as the outer ones, while on the shovelnose sturgeon, all four barbels are the same length. The inner barbels of the pallid sturgeon are positioned in front of the outer ones, but those on the shovelnose sturgeon are all located in essentially a straight line. The length and positioning of the barbels {{is one of the best}} ways to distinguish the two species.|$|E

5|$|At 6.8 to 9.2 (7.7) mm, {{males are}} only <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> long as females. Their maximum width is 34 to 42 (37) μm. The {{length of the}} {{esophagus}} is 2.3 to 3.0 (2.6) mm, of which the muscular pharynx makes up 260 to 315 (273) μm, and is lined by 35 to 42 (37) stichocytes. The back region of the worm is 4.5 to 6.2 (5.1) mm long. The back, or rectal, opening of the digestive tube is located {{near the end of}} the worm, and the length of the cloaca is 530 to 576 (550) μm. Near the back end, there are two alae (ridges) at the sides (laterally), which are 40 to 55 (46) μm long; these are located at 10 to 15 μm from another, small ala at the tip. In A.putorii, the lateral alae are much longer and reach the ala at the tip. The spicule, a spikelike structure that functions in reproduction, is curved at the tip and hardened and has a length of 380 to 426 (406) μm. It is smaller than that of the similar A.tamiasstriati from North American chipmunks and larger than that of A.murissylvatici from various North American and European small rodents, but about as long as that of A.putorii, which however lacks the curved tip.|$|E
5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} pipistrelle. It is long-furred and the body is reddish above, with the head a trifle darker, and yellowish-brown below. The glandular swellings on the muzzle, next to the nose, are hairless. The dark, short, round ears bear three to five ridges. The crescent-shaped tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> long as the ear and contains a slight constriction on the back side of its base. The wings are dark. The third through fifth metacarpals (hand bones) are about equally long, but the first phalange (finger bone) on the third finger is short. P.endoi has a longer first phalange on the third metacarpal. P.raceyi has short tibiae (lower leg bones) and small feet and the tail is shorter than the head and body. Forearm length is 28.0 to 31.2mm (1.10 to 1.23in), tail length is 22.9 to 30.3mm (0.90 to 1.19in), hindfoot length is 5.3 to 7.5mm (0.21 to 0.30in), and ear length is 7.5 to 10.6mm (0.30 to 0.42in) in 13 measured specimens. Females average slightly larger than males.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin is metabolized {{mostly in}} the liver. As it becomes {{converted}} to psilocin, it undergoes a first-pass effect, whereby its concentration is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation. Psilocin is broken down by the enzyme monoamine oxidase to produce several metabolites that can circulate in the blood plasma, including 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde, 4-hydroxytryptophol, and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid. Some psilocin is not broken down by enzymes and instead forms a glucuronide; this is a biochemical mechanism animals use to eliminate toxic substances by linking them with glucuronic acid, which can then be excreted in the urine. Psilocin is glucuronated by the glucuronosyltransferase enzymes UGT1A9 in the liver, and by UGT1A10 in the small intestine. Based on studies using animals, about 50% of ingested psilocybin is absorbed through the stomach and intestine. Within 24hours, about 65% of the absorbed psilocybin is excreted into the urine, and a further 15–20% is excreted in the bile and feces. Although {{most of the remaining}} drug is eliminated in this way within 8hours, it is still detectable in the urine after 7days. Clinical studies show that psilocin concentrations in the plasma of adults average about 8µg/liter within 2hours after ingestion of a single 15mg oral psilocybin dose; psychological effects occur with a blood plasma concentration of 4–6µg/liter. Psilocybin is about 100 times less potent than LSD on a weight per weight basis, and the physiological effects last <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> long.|$|E
