A correction factor was developed based on the water content of sediment samples that corrects sediment bacteria microscopic counts for masking due to sediment particles. Using this correction factor, it was found that sediment bacterial biomass in 22 lakes was positively related to an indicator of the rate of <b>allochthonous</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> input to lakes. However, the total hypolimnetic carbon mineralization rate of lakes, which integrates both sediment and hypolimnetic water column mineralization, was found to be driven mainly by phytoplankton carbon and to occur mainly in the hypolimnetic water column. Indeed, various hypolimnetic and sediment catabolic processes were found to show a strong positive relationship with indicators of autochthonous organic matter standing stocks and production. In no cases were the processes significantly positively correlated with <b>allochthonous</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> standing stocks. Results of this research show that autochthonous primary production drives carbon recycling in the hypolimnetic water column, with the ultimate fate of this production being determined principally by the hypolimnetic thickness. The main fate of <b>allochthonous</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in lakes is to become a major component of sediment organic matter where it likely drives a much slower catabolism due to its recalcitrance...|$|E

40|$|Carbon stable isotopic {{composition}} was determined for zooplankton, POM, DOM and, in two cases, phytoplankton from 12 small forest lakes in southern Finland during summer 1997. The lakes {{were selected to}} provide {{a wide range of}} water colour (12 - 365 mg Pt l- 1) but minimum variability in other limnological characteristics. POM and DOM showed similar stable isotope ratios (δ 13 C around - 28 ‰, comparable with values commonly reported for terrestrial C 3 vegetation) and these showed no relationship to water colour. Zooplankton were consistently depleted in 13 C relative to the bulk POM on which they might feed. This relative 13 C depletion increased significantly with water colour. Therefore the zooplankton must have been feeding selectively on isotopically light food sources and doing so to a greater extent in the more humic lakes. Although phytoplankton were 13 C-depleted relative to POM, their abundance and their variability between lakes did not appear to explain adequately the observed trend in zooplankton stable isotope ratios. We propose that some zooplankton were grazing on methanotrophic bacteria which utilise isotopically light methane derived from <b>allochthonous</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> decomposed under anaerobic conditions.

40|$|Seasonal {{studies were}} carried out from 21 stations, {{comprising}} of three zones, of Cochin Estuary, to assess the organic matter quality and trophic status. The hydographical parameters showed significant seasonal variations and nutrients and chlorophylls were generally higher during the monsoon season. However, chemical contamination along with the seasonal limitations of light and nitrogen imposed restrictions on the primary production and as a result, mesotrophic conditions generally prevailed in the water column. The nutrient stoichometries and delta C- 13 values of surficial sediments indicated significant allochthonous contribution of organic matter. Irrespective of the higher content of total organic matter, the labile organic matter was very low. Dominance of carbohydrates over lipids and proteins indicated the lower nutritive aspect of the organic matter, and their aged and refractory nature. This, along with higher amount of phytodetritus and the low algal contribution to the biopolymeric carbon corroborated the dominance of <b>allochthonous</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and the heterotrophic nature. The spatial and seasonal variations of labile organic components could effectively substantiate the observed shift in the productivity pattern. An alternative ratio, lipids to tannins and lignins, was proposed to ascertain the relative contribution of <b>allochthonous</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in the estuary.

Concentration of C_org ranged from 3. 5 to 9 mg/l. The highest weighted-mean {{concentration}} of C_org occurred in shallow bays of the Onega Gulf (Suma Bay - 6. 17 mg/l, Kolezhma Bay - 5. 25 mg/ 1); slightly lower levels occurred in the Soroka Bay (4. 85 mg/l) and Kem' Bay (4. 78 mg/l).

One exception is low-productive humic lakes, where <b>allochthonous</b> dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (ADOM) {{is the major}} driver. We hypothesized that bacterial production (BP) is similarly regulated in subarctic estuaries that receive large amounts of riverine material. BP and potential explanatory factors were measured during May–August 2011 in the subarctic Råne Estuary, northern Sweden. The highest BP was observed in spring, concomitant with the spring river-flush and the lowest rates occurred during summer when primary production (PP) peaked. PLS correlations showed that ∼ 60  % of the BP variation was explained by different ADOM components, measured as humic substances, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and coloured dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (CDOM). On average, BP was threefold higher than PP. The bioavailability of <b>allochthonous</b> dissolved <b>organic</b> carbon (ADOC) exhibited large spatial and temporal variation; however, the average value was low, ∼ 2  %. Bioassay analysis showed that BP in the near-shore area was potentially carbon limited early in the season, while BP at seaward stations was more commonly limited by nitrogen-phosphorus. Nevertheless, the bioassay indicated that ADOC could contribute significantly to the in situ BP, ∼ 60  %. We conclude that ADOM is a regulator of BP in the studied estuary.

It describes mechanics of biogenic elements of the marine environment in the process of production and destruction of autochthonous and <b>allochthonous</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> This article discusses organics and flows of energy, which migrate to the trophic chain of the marine environment in the process of self-purification. And it shows the individual elements {{of the process of}} self-purification in the marine environment and the factors influencing it. In the article it is noted that self-cleaning of water environment happens due to the cycling of matter in the pond. It is emphasized that tension, focus and self-purification completeness are regulated by biotic turnover and energy turnover, which is determined by the type of limnological type of reservoir, geographical features (climate conditions), geophysical and anthropogenic impacts. The article notes that the more diverse system of organisms is, the fuller the compounds’ decay is. This property of organisms to complement each other is called buffering of the system. Complex system of organisms cope better with organic and bacterial contamination, but is less responsive to insertion nutrients; biotic cycle in complex systems is more intense. Bacterial community plays the major role in the process of self-purification of biological marine environments. They are the major element of the coastal zone ecosystems. This article shows that during the growth of bacterial populations most of the energy supplied to the aquatic ecosystems with auto- and <b>allochthonous</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> is processed.

40|$|Abstract. Nitrification, the chemoautotrophic {{process by}} which NH 4 -N is {{converted}} to NO 3 -N, is an integral biogeochemical transformation in stream ecosystems. Previous {{research has shown that}} experimental addition of dissolved organic C inhibits rates of nitrification, and that NH 4 -N addition stimulates rates of nitrification. In many streams, large amounts of C and N may be present in particulate and sorbed forms. Hugh White Creek, a headwater stream located in the southern Ap-palachian mountains of North Carolina, USA, has very low concentrations of dissolved N and receives large inputs of <b>allochthonous</b> particulate <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (POM) each autumn. We conducted a seasonal survey of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (OM) standing stocks and nitrification rates, and we experimentally manip-ulated dissolved C and N supplies in stream-sediment microcosms to determine: 1) how rates of nitrification compare across seasons, and 2) to what extent nitrification rates are influenced by sea-sonal changes in standing stocks and relative abundances of particulate, sorbed, and dissolved forms of C and N. Rates of nitrification were closely and positively related to rates of ammonification which, in turn, were negatively related to C:N ratios of fine benthic <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (FBOM). Uniform addi-tions of dissolved C and N had varying effects on sediment N-transformation rates during different seasons.

40|$|The {{composition}} {{and behavior of}} <b>allochthonous</b> particulate <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (POM) {{in the northern part}} of Ise Bay, Japan were investigated to elucidate the short-term variation in POM accompanying changes in river discharge. The behavior of POM was significantly regulated by hy-drographic conditions, but behavior was different in the upper layer versus the middle and lower layers. The former showed simple dynamics controlled by the river plume, while the latter showed complex dynamics because of changes in river discharge and subsequent variation in estuarine circulation. During normal discharge, the contribution of riverine materials to POC in the surface water within the bay was negligible because most riverine <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> is deposited before flowing into the bay. During high discharge, on the other hand, the contribution of riverine <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> to total POM increased to 50 % at w 10 km from the river mouth. Though riverine <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> loads increased, the total amount of POC decreased around the river mouth due to flushing of phytoplankton. After river discharge, the contribution decreased rapidly. The behavior of POM in the middle and lower layers differed from that in the surface layer. At normal discharge, the influence of riverine <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> was weak. During high discharge, high flooding temporarily weakened the bottom inflow, resulting in heavier riverine <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> distributed from the river mouth to mid regions within the bay in the lower layer.

40|$|European {{estuaries}} {{are characterized}} by high loads of nutrients and <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> They have therefore the potential to sustain high primary production rates as well as high bacterial activity, with the balance often tipping towards a net heterotrophic ecosystem (respiration exceeds primary production). <b>Organic</b> <b>matter</b> that is imported from upstream reaches and terrestrial origins is considered <b>allochthonous,</b> while <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> derived from local, estuarine primary production is autochthonous. The ecological focus of this thesis is on the balance between autochthonous and <b>allochthonous</b> <b>organic</b> carbon sources for secondary production. Mesozooplankton, mostly comprising small crustaceans and larval stages of larger organisms between 0. 2 and 2 mm length, are an important link in the aquatic food chain, grazing smaller size fractions and serving as food for larger animals, including fish. We studied the contribution of autochthonous versus allochthonous food sources for mesozoo- plankton biomass in the Scheldt Estuary, Belgium and the Netherlands (chapter 4). Bacteria use dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (DOM) {{as a source of}} energy and biomass. They have the choice between allochthonous DOM, which is present in high concentrations but is rather refractory, and autochthonous DOM, which has a higher turnover rate and includes many compounds that are readily available for bacterial consumption, but whose concentration is lower and more variable. We studied interactions between bacteria and algae, the producers of autochthonous DOM, in two European estuaries: the Scheldt Estuary, the Netherlands (chapter 6), and Randers Fjord, Denmark (chapter 5). Besides the ecological aspect of the thesis, focusing on the microbial food web of estuaries, substantial effort has been put into the development of statistical and modeling techniques and their application in an ecological context. Bayesian statistics are fairly new to ecology, and have potential for parameter estimation, especially in non-linear models. They have been applied to simple food web models in the Scheldt Estuary (chapter 6), and formed the basis for two methodological chapters. Chapter 2 discusses a method to sample parameter distributions in underdetermined, linear systems, a type of models that is often encountered in food web ecology. Chapter 3 offers a Bayesian alternative to existing techniques that estimate taxonomic composition in ecological samples from molecular biomarkers, such as pigments or fatty acids. Stable isotopes of C and N have {{a central role in the}} unraveling of the estuarine microbial food web. Stable isotope ratios in different food web components are strong indicators for the origin of <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> based on the fact that the isotopic signature of <b>allochthonous</b> and autochthonous <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> is significantly different (chapter 4). When this is not the case, or when one wants to study in detail short-term interactions between food web compartments, stable isotopes can be added deliberately to an experimental setup and food web fluxes can be derived from stable isotope incorporation into different food web components. We measured 13 C concentration in polar lipid-derived fatty acids (PLFA) using gas chromatography - combustion - isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-c-IRMS). The isotope composition of algae- or bacteria-specific PLFA can be used as a proxy for the isotopic composition of algae and bacteria, respectively, thus avoiding the need for physical separation of these groups. Calculations and model fitting have been done partly in FEMME, a FORTRAN environment providing tools for ecological modeling (chapter 5), and partly in R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The methods developed in the framework of this thesis (chapters 2 and 3) have been published as contributed packages for R, and are available for download on the R website...|$|R

Compared to rather detailed knowledge of the evolution of large and small lakes in Scandinavia and Canada, and large lakes in Eurasia, highly abundant small boreal lakes of northwest Russia have received very little attention, although they may become important centers of attraction of growing rural population in the near future. Here we present the results of a multidisciplinary, multi-annual study of a small boreal humic lake of NW Russia. A shallow (3 m) and a deep (16 m) site of this lake were regularly sampled for a range of chemical and biological parameters. Average multi-daily, summer-time values of the epilimnion (upper oxygenated) layer of the lake provided indications of possible trends in temperature, nutrients, and bacterio-plankton concentration that revealed the local pollution impact in the shallow zone and overall environmental trend in the deep sampling point of the lake. Organic phosphorus, nitrate, and lead were found to be most efficient tracers of local anthropogenic pollution, especially visible in the surface layer of the shallow site of the lake. Cycling of trace elements between the epilimnion and hypolimnion is tightly linked to dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> speciation and size fractionation due to the dominance of organic and organo-ferric colloids.

During the summer, the proportion of mixotrophs increased gradually from the phosphorus-rich south to the ADOM-rich north, probably due to ADOM-fueled microbes. The opposite trend was observed for autotrophs. The chlorophyll a (Chl a) : carbon (C) ratio increased while the levels of photoprotective pigments decreased from south to north, indicating adaptation to the darker humic-rich water in the north. Picocyanobacteria dominated in phosphorusrich areas while nanoplankton increased in ADOM- rich areas. During the winter-spring the phytoplankton biomass and concentrations of photoprotective pigments were low, and no trends with respect to autotrophs and mixotrophs were observed. Microplankton was the dominant size group in the entire study area.

Previous {{studies have shown that}} these low-molecular-weight (LMW) substrates are released by phytoplankton but also that unidentified LMW compounds of terrestrial origin is a subsidy for bacterial metabolism in unproductive freshwater systems. We tested the hypothesis that different terrestrially derived CA, AA and CH compounds can offer substantial support for aquatic bacterial metabolism in fresh waters that are dominated by <b>allochthonous</b> dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (DOM). Drainage water from three catchments of different characters in the Krycklan experimental area in Northern Sweden were studied at the rising and falling limb of the spring flood, using a 2 -week bioassay approach. A variety of CA, AA and CH compounds were significantly assimilated by bacteria, meeting 15 - 100 % of the bacterial carbon demand and explaining most of the observed variation in bacterial growth efficiency (BGE; R- 2 = 0. 66). Of the 29 chemical species that was detected, acetate was the most important, representing 45 % of the total bacterial consumption of all LMW compounds. We suggest that LMW organic compounds in boreal spring flood drainage could potentially support all in situ bacterial production in receiving lake waters during periods of weeks to months after the spring flood...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{understand}} the temporal changes in planktonic populations and to highlight some important factors that control the biological functioning and evolution of a recently flooded reservoir, the Sep reservoir (Massif Central, France). To achieve this objective, a 1 D vertical coupled physical-biological model was used and developed. It couples relevant physical processes (dispersion, advection and convection) with biological processes taking into account the complexity of interactions within the microbial food web, including the conventional grazing food chain with a microbial loop. Based on numerous data collected in the field over three summers (1996, 1997, and 1998) since the flooding of the reservoir, the model was applied over this period to investigate the evolution of the biological structure over these 3 years. Two main assumptions were tested: (1) biodegradability of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (OM) increases over time leading to easier assimilation by heterotrophic and mixotrophic organisms; and (2) bioavailability of phosphorus increases over time leading to easier uptake by organisms. Based on an accurate description of the physical behavior of the water column and on numerous physical and biological available data, the evolution of the microbial food web structure was correctly simulated. During the first year of the study, the plankton community was dominated by mixotrophic organisms and bacteria followed by strictly autotrophic plankton. Then, during the second and third years, autotrophic organism biomass became dominant and reached around 64 % of the total biomass in 1998. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the initial <b>allochthonous</b> dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (DOM) strongly influenced the structure and the functioning of the microbial food web in the reservoir...|$|R
40|$|Diel {{dissolved}} oxygen (DO) data {{were used to}} characterize seasonal, inter-annual, and longitudinal variation in production and respiration for the James River Estuary. Two computational methods (Bayesian and bookkeeping) were applied to these data to determine whether inferences regarding DO metabolism are sensitive to methodology. Net metabolism was sensitive to methodology as Bayesian results indicated net heterotrophy (production 3 ̆c respiration) while bookkeeping results indicated net autotrophy (production 3 ̆e respiration). Differences in net metabolism among the methods was due to low seasonal variation in respiration using the Bayesian method, whereas bookkeeping results showed {{a strong correlation between}} production and respiration. Bayesian results suggest a dependence on <b>allochthonous</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (OM) whereas bookkeeping results suggest that metabolism is dependent on autochthonous OM. This study highlights the importance in considering the method used to derive metabolic estimates as it can impact the assessment of trophic status and sources of OM supporting an estuary...|$|E
40|$|During the {{extension}} of Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 76 a new and previously unpenetrated lithological unit composed mainly of claystones was cored above basalt basement at Site 534 in the Blake-Bahama Basin. The Callovian {{part of the new}} unit contains interbedded 'black shales' which were hitherto unexpected {{in this part of the}} section. This Paper presents a brief palynological examination of lithofacies-kerogen relationships in these sediments and shows that their organic content is almost entirely a function of the re-deposition of terrestial and marine organic matter versus the ambient redox conditions of the depositional environment. <b>Allochthonous</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> inputs are highest in the interbedded turbidites and decline progressively toward the pelagic black shales in which marine organic matter is comparatively well preserved. The significance of various kerogen and palynomorph indices are discussed. The study emphasizes the absolute necessity for sedimentologically-aware sampling in all palynological and geochemical work on lithologically heterogeneous sequences...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Climate {{change is}} likely to have large effects on the Baltic Sea ecosystem. Simulations {{indicate}} 2 – 4 C warming and 50 – 80 % decrease in ice cover by 2100. Precipitation may increase * 30 % in the north, causing increased land runoff of <b>allochthonous</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (AOM) and organic pollutants and decreased salinity. Coupled physical–biogeochemical models indicate that, in the south, bottom-water anoxia may spread, reducing cod recruitment and increasing sediment phosphorus release, thus promoting cyanobacterial blooms. In the north, heterotrophic bacteria will be favored by AOM, while phytoplankton production may be reduced. Extra trophic levels in the food web may increase energy losses and consequently reduce fish production. Future management of the Baltic Sea must consider the effects of climate change on the ecosystem dynamics and functions, as well as the effects of anthropogenic nutrient and pollutant load. Monitoring should have a holistic approach, encompassing both autotrophic (phytoplankton) and heterotrophic (e. g., bacterial) processes...|$|E
40|$|The article {{reports the}} {{conducted}} analyses of certain chemical parameters characterising the sediments of Poland’s Besko Reservoir. Specificall, determinations concerned the pH value, percentage <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (OM), total <b>organic</b> carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), carbonates (CO 3 2 -), total phosphorus (TP) and its fractions, {{as well as}} heavy metals (Fe, Al, Cr, Cu, Ni, Cd, Zn, Mn). The sediments have a slight alkaline reaction, with pH values correlating positively with the high content of carbonates. The sediments have low <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> content, while <b>organic</b> carbon accounts for about 30 % of OM. The values for the C:N ratio point to an <b>allochthonous</b> origin for <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> The analysis of phosphorus fractionation showed that inorganic phosphorus (IP) is predominant at every research station. The lowest percentage for a fraction was in turn obtained for NAIP. This testifiesto a slight anthropogenic impact of the catchment area. The sediments can be classifiedas of the 2 nd purity class (according to PIG), due to their highest concentration of chromium. According to Müller’s classification,the sediments can be classifiedas purity class 3 (i. e. with moderate contamination). The values noted for the EF coefficienconfirma very strong enrichment by chromium ions. In addition, chromium, copper, nickel and cadmium have a negative effecton aquatic organisms. The {{results show that the}} sediments can be used for example in building and maintaining hydraulic structures...|$|R
40|$|Suspended {{sediment}} (SS) and <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in rivers can harm {{brown trout}} Salmo trutta by impact {{on health and}} fitness of free swimming fish and siltation of the riverbed. The later results in a decrease of hydraulic conductivity and therefore smaller oxygen supply to the salmonid embryos. Additionally, oxygen demand within riverbeds will increase as the pool of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> increases. We assessed the temporal and spatial dynamics of sediment, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) during the brown trout spawning season and used C isotopes {{as well as the}} C/N atomic ratio to distinguish autochthonous and <b>allochthonous</b> sources of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in SS loads. The visual basic program IsoSource with 13 Ctot and 15 N as input isotopes was used to quantify the sources of SS in respect of time and space. <b>Organic</b> <b>matter</b> fractions in the infiltrated and suspended sediment were highest during low flow periods with small sediment loads and lowest during high flow periods with high sediment loads. Peak values in nitrate and dissolved organic C were measured during high flow and precipitation probably due to leaching from pasture and arable land. The <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> was of <b>allochthonous</b> sources as indicated by the C/N atomic ratio and &delta; 13 Corg. <b>Organic</b> <b>matter</b> in SS increased from up- to downstream due to pasture and arable land. The fraction of SS originating from upper watershed riverbed sediment increased at all sites during high flow. Its mean fraction decreased from up- to downstream. During base flow conditions, the major sources of SS are pasture and arable land. The later increased during rainy and warmer periods probably due to snow melting and erosion processes. These modeling results support the measured increased DOC and NO 3 concentrations during high flow...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMethane-related carbonates from Hydrate Ridge {{typically}} show several macroscopically distinguishable mineral phases, namely whitish aragonite, lucent aragonite, {{and gray}} micrite. The relationship of these phases to particular microorganisms or biogeochemical processes {{is as yet}} unclear. We used a miniaturized biomarker technique on mg samples, combined with factor analysis and subsequent electron microprobe analysis, to study lipid biomarkers and chemical compositions of the individual phases. This allows us to identify particular mechanisms involved {{in the formation of}} the different carbonate precipitates. Our combined analysis of biomarkers and petrographic traits shows that most of the lipids related to the anaerobic oxidation of methane (> 90 % by weight) are concentrated within only a minor compartment (~ 20 % by volume) of the Hydrate Ridge carbonates, the whitish aragonite. The patterns indicate that the whitish aragonite represents fossilized biofilms of methanotrophic consortia containing mainly archaea of the ANME- 2 group and sulfate reducing bacteria, whereas the precipitation of the lucent aragonite may have lacked the immediate proximity of microorganisms during formation. By contrast, the gray micrite formed by incorporation of <b>allochthonous</b> <b>organic</b> and inorganic <b>matter</b> during carbonate precipitation induced by the anaerobic oxidation of methane involving ANME- 1 archaea...|$|R
