Uniaxial tensile testing {{results showed that}} with decreasing foil thickness the uniform elongation decreases for both <b>as-rolled</b> and annealed foils, whereas the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength increase for <b>as-rolled</b> foils, but decrease for the annealed foils. For both the <b>as-rolled</b> or annealed foils, bending fatigue resistance decreases with decreasing the foil thickness.

Then, as grain growth proceeded, the texture returned to the same one as the <b>as-rolled</b> textures. This texture return can be designated as Texture memory effect.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of processing conditions on material properties and fracture behaviour of the aluminium alloy EN AW 2014, depending on various processing conditions (<b>as-rolling,</b> quenching, severe plastic deformation - SPD by equal channel angular pressing - ECAP and ageing). (Tensile tests were carried out at strain rate of 2. 5 × 10 − 4 s− 1.) The evaluated mechanical properties show that ECAP has the highest effect on formability and mechanical properties of the aluminium alloy EN AW 2014. Severe plastic deformation by means of ECAP causes rapid increase of strength and only partial decrease of ductility was achieved. Strengthening of material is caused by grains refinement, strain hardening of solid solution.

40|$|Influence of roller {{burnishing}} (RB) on {{high cycle fatigue}} properties of the hot-rolled Mg- 12 Gd- 3 Y (wt. %) magnesium alloy was investigated. RB can significantly improve the fatigue life of the Mg- 12 Gd- 3 Y alloy. After RB, the fatigue strength (at 10 (7) cycles) in the <b>as-rolled</b> alloy and the aging heat-treated (T 5 -treated) specimens increased from 150 and 155 MPa, to 225 and 210 MPa, respectively. RB led to a subsurface fatigue-crack nucleation in both the <b>as-rolled</b> and the 15 -treated materials. In the <b>as-rolled</b> alloy, small cracks (in the stage I) propagated along cleavage planes after RB. In contrast, in the 15 -treated specimens, the small cracks grew by coalescence of the sheared dimples.

40|$|Abstract. Tensile {{properties}} of rolled and annealed copper thin foils were investigated {{based on the}} grain size and thickness. Yield strength was higher in the thinner foil than in the thicker foil at <b>as-rolled</b> state. Difference of yield strength between the thinner foil and the thicker foil becomes small at annealed state. Tensile strength was higher in the thinner foil than in the thicker foil at <b>as-rolled</b> state, but it was reversed at annealed state. Strain to fracture or elongation increased with increasing thickness in the annealed state. A knife edge type of fracture was characterized in both the <b>as-rolled</b> state and the annealed state. A higher tensile strength and strain to fracture of the annealed thicker foil was attributed to the higher number of grains per thickness. From this work, {{it was concluded that}} mechanical {{properties of}} thin foils were dependent upon the number of grains per thickness...|$|E
40|$|The "cold-rolling" {{experiments}} {{for several}} values of true strain namely 5 percent, 10 percent, and 15 percent respectively {{have been carried}} out on commercial SS- 405 steel samples at 350 oC; the <b>as-rolled</b> samples were cut into several pieces in size of 10 x 10 x 5 mm 3, and some pieces were annealed to 550 oC for 24 hours. All samples were then mounted and polished before etching in order to observe the grain boundaries. The microstructure observation on all samples was carried out by using optical microscope (MO), meanwhile X-ray diffraction technique was employed in order to support the identification of the existing phases and to verify changes with respect to crystal orientation; the hardness tests were carried out by using Vickers micro hardness tester. The microstructure observation supported by X-ray diffraction results shows that the phase grains of rolled sample tends to take the oblong-shape, accompanied by a preferred orientation predominantly inclined toward the (110) plane. The microhardness testing results show that there has been an increase in the hardness of the <b>as-rolled</b> samples; Mainly because of the nearly negligible thickness of the original sample (being only 5 mm in size), the 15 percent <b>as-rolled</b> samples exhibits only a slight reduction in hardness compared to the 10 percent <b>as-rolled</b> samples; The main cause of this effect is the movement of some dislocations infiltrating the surface resulting in the reduction of the inner-stress in the bulk of the samples. In the rolled-annealed samples there is a very significant reduction in hardness compared to the <b>as-rolled</b> samples. Here the main cause is the recrystallization process taking place during annealing, which tends to significantly reduce the dislocations...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{describes}} the tensile flow and work hardening {{behavior of a}} high strength 7010 aluminum alloy by constitutive relations. The alloy has been hot rolled by three different cross-rolling schedules. Room temperature tensile properties have been evaluated {{as a function of}} tensile axis orientation in the as-hot rolled as well as peak aged conditions. It is found that both the Ludwigson and a generalized Voce-Bergstrom relation adequately describe the tensile flow behavior of the present alloy in all conditions compared to the Hollomon relation. The variation in the Ludwigson fitting parameter could be correlated well with the microstructural features and anisotropic contribution of strengthening precipitates in the <b>as-rolled</b> and peak aged conditions, respectively. The hardening rate and the saturation stress of the first Voce-Bergstrom parameter, on the other hand, depend mainly on the crystallographic texture of the specimens. It is further shown that for the peak aged specimens the uniform elongation (epsilon(u)) derived from the Ludwigson relation matches well with the measured epsilon(u) irrespective of processing and loading directions. However, the Ludwigson fit overestimates the epsilon(u) in case of the <b>as-rolled</b> specimens. The Hollomon fit, on the other hand, predicts well the measured epsilon(u), of the <b>as-rolled</b> specimens but severely underestimates the epsilon(u), for the peak aged specimens. Contrarily, both the relations significantly overestimate the UTS of the <b>as-rolled</b> and the peak aged specimens. The Voce-Bergstrom parameters define the slope of e Theta-sigma plots in the stage-III regime when the specimens show a classical linear decrease in hardening rate in stage-III.

40|$|Corrosion {{of carbon}} (black) steel {{reinforcing}} bars (rebar) {{is the major}} cause of damage and deterioration of reinforced concrete structures in maritime regions and in climates where de-icing salts are used. The cause of the corrosion is diffusion of chloride ions to the steel surface through the concrete {{in which it is}} placed. The bars are naturally passivated by the high pH of concrete interstitial pore fluid, and will not corrode in chloride-free concrete. Chloride ions break down the passive film, allowing dissolution of the steel. Corrosion of reinforcing steel drastically reduces the service lives of concrete structures. Where chlorides can not be avoided, stainless steel is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative reinforcing material. Stainless steel is able to withstand greater concentrations of chlorides, extending the service lives of structure in which they are placed. Due to high initial cost, stainless steel is often avoided in the design of new structures. In order to reduce the cost of stainless rebar, it has been proposed that the standard process of abrasive blasting and pickling of the steels not be performed, as these steps are mainly used to restore a bright and shiny surface, a quality not required for steels embedded in concrete. AISI 304 LN, AISI 316 LN and 2205 duplex stainless steels were tested with pickled surfaces as well as with mill-scale intact (<b>as-rolled)</b> {{in order to determine the}} affect of pickling vs. not pickling on the corrosion behaviour of the steels. Steels were tested in solutions simulating concrete interstitial pore fluid containing from 0 to 16 % Cl- by mass of solution, simulating cement paste with 0 to 7. 5 % Cl- by mass of cement, which is near the solubility limit of Cl- in pore fluid. Steels were also tested in thin mortar shells, with Cl- ions being rapidly diffused to the surface due to an applied potential gradient. The microcell corrosion performance of the <b>as-rolled</b> steels was slightly worse than that of pickled steels; however, the corrosion rates of the <b>as-rolled</b> steels at 16 % Cl- in pore fluid are near 3 µm/year, while black steel is normally observed to be actively corroding at 10 µm/year in cement containing as low as 0. 1 % Cl- by mass of cement, or 0. 2 % Cl- by mass of solution. No significant difference was observed between different grades of stainless steel in either the <b>as-rolled</b> or pickled conditions. <b>As-rolled</b> stainless steels exhibited poor pitting resistance when an anodic potential is applied, but the corrosion occurs at potentials much higher than experienced in service and at Cl- concentrations far greater than that needed to initiate corrosion on black steel; the time required to reach these higher Cl- levels would allow for maintenance free service long enough to justify the cost of <b>as-rolled</b> stainless steel over black steel. The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code, CSA S 6 - 06, specifies that reinforced concrete bridges should meet a service life of 75 years. It is concluded that, given the time required for concentrated chlorides to accumulate at the steel, the stainless steel rebar in the <b>as-rolled</b> condition would allow reinforced concrete structures to reach the specified service life, as long as care is taken to avoid contamination of the steel/surface by black steel from handling, or by secondary phases within the steel, Cr 23 C 6 and MnS in particular...|$|E

The in-plane anisotropy factors (IPA factor) of tensile strength, yield strength, and elongation in <b>as-rolled</b> 7050 aluminum alloy fluctuate in the vicinity of 5 %. The anisotropy of the as-quenched 7050 aluminum alloy is mainly affected by the texture according to single crystal analysis based on the Schmid factor method. Besides, the IPA factor of the elongation in the over-aged 7050 aluminum alloy reaches 11. 6 %, illustrating that the anisotropy of the over-aged 7050 aluminum alloy is more prominent than that of the as-quenched.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was performed on}} alloys of a 12 wt% Cr steel (3 CR 12) that had undergone different thermomechanical processing routes prior to the annealing step of production. The aim {{of this research was}} to identify any changes in the annealing response of 3 CR 12 steel due to the different thermomechanical processing routes to which the alloys had been subjected. Three alloys of 3 CR 12 were subjected to various cooling treatments immediately following hot rolling. This was accomplished by water quenching, air cooling and insulatory cooling of the hot-rolled plates. Characterisation of the alloys in the hot-rolled and annealed conditions included optical and electron microscopy, macro- and microhardness tests, tensile tests and impact energy tests, dilatometry, differential thermal analysis and volume fraction analysis. Alloys in the <b>as-rolled</b> state exhibited an increase in martensite content related to an increase in the cooling rate following hot rolling. The increase in martensite content inﬂuenced the alloys' mechanical properties by raising their bulk hardness, UTS and yield strength. This was coupled with a decrease in the elongation and impact toughness of the alloys. Furthermore, the Ac 1 was found to increase with higher cooling rates following hot rotting. Variations in the <b>as-rolled</b> microstructures influenced the alloys' subsequent annealing response, with there being a greater and more immediate response to the annealing treatment by alloys subjected to higher cooling rates after hot rolling.

40|$|This project {{addresses}} {{critical issues}} related to aging {{in the presence of}} hydrides (UH{sub 3 }) in DU and the subsequent effect on mechanical behavior. Rolled DU specimens with three different hydrogen concentrations and the <b>as-rolled</b> condition were studied. The texture measurements indicate that the hydrogen charging is affecting the initial <b>as-rolled</b> DU microstructure/texture. The macroscopic mechanical behavior suggests the existence of a threshold between the 0 wpmm H and 0. 3 wppm H conditions. A VPSC simulation of the macroscopic strain-stress behavior, when taking into account only a texture effect, shows no agreement with the experiment. This suggests that the macroscopic mechanical behavior observed is indeed due to the presence of hydrogen/hydrides in the DU bulk. From the lattice strain variation it can be concluded that the hydrogen is affecting the magnitude and/or the nature of CRSS. The metallography indicates the specimens that underwent the hydrogen charging process, developed large grains and twinning, which were enhanced by the presence of hydrogen.

It {{was found that the}} yield/ultimate strength of the two <b>as-rolled</b> alloys increased with the rolling strains. Twinning was the main deformation mechanism in GWK 930 alloy while few twinning could be detected in the GWZK 9300 alloy due to the dense secondary phases such as LPSO structure.

40|$|Deterioration of {{reinforced}} concrete structures due primarily to chloride induced corrosion of plain carbon-steel reinforcement {{is a widespread}} problem, particularly in areas close to marine environments and where de-icing salts are used to keep roadways clear of ice. Replacing plain carbon-steel rebar with highly corrosion resistant stainless steel rebar {{has been shown to}} greatly increase the lifespan of concrete structures in harsh environments, and yields favourable life-cycle costs despite high initial costs. In attempt to lower stainless steel rebar’s initial cost of processing, this research compared its corrosion resistance in the pickled (mill scale removed) and <b>as-rolled</b> (mill scale intact) surface conditions. Rebar was embedded in highly-chloride contaminated concrete, and corrosion performance between the two surface types was compared in order to determine if conventional pickling of stainless steel rebar is necessary. A second part of this research addressed possible concern of reduced corrosion resistance of pickled stainless steel rebar in concrete exposed to chlorides when subjected to dynamic loading due to micro-motion at the concrete/crack interface. It was concluded that <b>as-rolled</b> stainless steel rebar in aggressive environments would provide sufficient corrosion resistance for the 75 year lifespan currently specified by the Canadian Bridge Code (CAN/CSA-S 6 - 06, 2006), however it is recommended that monitoring of these specimens be continued to ensure high corrosion rates and/or concrete cracking do not develop. As well, investigation into the effects crevice corrosion cells found in typical concrete structures could have on <b>as-rolled</b> stainless steel rebar’s corrosion resistance should be undertaken. With regard to loading conditions, no significant evidence was found suggesting that pickled stainless steel rebar has reduced corrosion resistance when loaded dynamically versus statically. Therefore pickled stainless steel rebar is recommended for use in dynamically loaded concrete structures if others factors permit. However, the higher electrochemical noise measured during cyclic loading suggests that corrosion behaviour could be influenced largely by frequency of loading, and so further study should be undertaken for applications involving more extreme cyclic loading conditions than those used in this experiment...|$|E
