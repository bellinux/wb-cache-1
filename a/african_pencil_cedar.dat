40|$|<b>African</b> <b>pencil</b> <b>cedar</b> (Juniperus procera Hochst. ex Endlicher 1847) is a tropical, irregularly growing {{species that}} can produce annual growth rings in {{response}} to an annual cycle of wet and dry seasons. In this paper, we assess the periodicity of growth-ring formation for 13 stem discs from a site in Central-Northern Ethiopia by crossdating and radiocarbon dating. The crossdating process is described more transparently than usual to allow open discussion of the methodology employed. Although the ring-width series could be tentatively matched, radiocarbon dating revealed that the growth rings of the junipers from the studied site are neither annual nor represent a common periodicity. It was found that the trees are exceptionally sensitive and respond individually to the complex local climate. For future research, it is recommended to select more mesic sites with an unambiguously unimodal rainfall regime and to gain external evidence to support assumptions about the periodicity of growth-ring formation in Juniperus procer...|$|E

50|$|Polyscias elegans, {{known as}} the celery wood is a {{rainforest}} tree of eastern Australia. It occurs {{in a variety of}} different rainforest types, from fertile basaltic soils, to sand dunes and less fertile sedimentary soils. The range of natural distribution is from Jervis Bay (35° S) in southern New South Wales to Thursday Island (10° S), north of the Australian continent. Other common names include black <b>pencil</b> <b>cedar</b> and silver basswood. Polyscias elegans is useful to bush regenerators as a nursery tree, which provides shade for longer-lived young trees underneath. Polyscias elegans is also known as Celery wood, Mowbulan whitewood, Silver basswood and White sycamore.|$|R

50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, over 240,000 pencils {{were used}} each day in the US. The favoured timber for <b>pencils</b> was Red <b>Cedar</b> as it was {{aromatic}} and did not splinter when sharpened. In the early 20th century supplies of Red Cedar were dwindling so that pencil manufacturers were forced to recycle the wood from cedar fences and barns to maintain supply.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{close-up}} of juniper (Juniperus) leaves and berries, ca. 1920. The leaves are thick needle-like leaves.; "This group consists of evergreen shrubs and trees that are found wild throughout Europe, North America, Asia, the West Indies, Canary Islands, and eastern Africa. Some are hardy, some are small enough for the rock garden, some are good foundation plants, and some grow into trees of medium size. Junipers, as they are commonly called, are divided into two categories based {{on the kind of}} leaves they produce. The mature trees either has scale-like, leaves closely pressed against the branch, or needle-like, spreading leaves that are arranged loosely on the branch. The leaves are dark bluish-green and they stay on the branches for five or six years. The dark blue cones are small (one-quarter-inch diameter) and berry-like, each containing one or more hard seeds. The Junipers have other common names including Savin and Red Cedar, but the tree is really a Juniper and not a true Cedar. Junipers grow from 30 to 40 feet high with a diameter of 1 to 2 feet or more. The wood of the Junipers is fragrant and very durable. It is often used as fencing, but is of value for more important purposes. The wood of J. virginiana is sometimes called <b>Pencil</b> <b>Cedar</b> because its wood is used for making lead pencils. In the south of France, the wood of J. Oxycedrus is distilled for medicinal oil it contains. The oil is called 'Oil of cade', and it is used in the treatment of skin diseases.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, the high demand for lumber {{led to the}} {{harvesting}} {{of most of the}} forests in the Central Basin. Red cedar in particular was popular for use in the making of furniture, fence rails, and <b>pencils.</b> In the <b>cedar</b> flats of Wilson County, small farmers were struggling with depletion of the already-thin soil layer caused by poor farming tactics. In 1935, as part of the New Deal, the federal government initiated a plan to resettle farmers living in badly eroded lands to allow the devastated forests to recover. As part of the Lebanon Cedar Forest Project, the federal Resettlement Administration helped move the farmers in the cedar flats to new locations, and the Works Project Administration constructed forestry and recreational facilities and planted thousands of red cedar seedlings. The work was supervised by the United States Forestry Service. [...] "Lebanon Cedar Forest" [...] officially opened in 1937, with local newspaper editor Dixon Merritt presiding over the opening ceremony. Although the land was managed by the Tennessee Department of Conservation, the federal government retained ownership until 1955.|$|R

I would as soon have thought of being cheerful in Abraham's bosom as in the palace of an Emperor. I supposed that Emperors were terrible people. I thought they never did any thing but wear magnificent crowns and red velvet dressing-gowns with dabs of wool sewed on them in spots, and sit on thrones and scowl at the flunkies and the people in the parquette, and order Dukes and Duchesses off to execution. I find, however, that when one is so fortunate as to get behind the scenes and see them at home and {{in the privacy of their}} firesides, they are strangely like common mortals. They are pleasanter to look upon then than they are in their theatrical aspect. It seems to come as natural to them to dress and act like other people as it is to put a friend's <b>cedar</b> <b>pencil</b> in your pocket when you are done using it. But I can never have any confidence in the tinsel kings of the theatre after this. It will be a great loss. I used to take such a thrilling pleasure in them.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the ways in which}} gender, empathy, and cultural orientation (communalism and competitive individualism) influence the moral judgments of urban fifth and eighth grade <b>African</b> American children. <b>Pencil</b> and paper meas-ures of these constructs were completed by 44 fifth and 46 eighth graders. Results revealed greater endorsement of communalism among girls than boys. Separate correlation matrices and path analysis models were computed for girls and boys. Communalism, empathy, and grade emerged as significant correlates and predic-tors of moral reasoning among boys. Empathy emerged as a mediator between communalism and moral reasoning for boys. Grade was the only significant cor-relate and predictor of moral reasoning for girls. The findings are discussed in terms of the study’s methodological limitations and implications for future re-search on African American culture and moral development. Morality connotes one’s sense of right and wrong. It implies thoughts, feelings, and actions of the self and others, which are relevant to both trans-gression and beneficence. Such issues have long been of interest to develop-mental psychologists (Turiel, 1998), and a scan of the contemporar...|$|R
40|$|Autosprout is {{the mass}} {{manufacturing}} equipment envisioned to produce Sprout, a pencil with a seed. This pencil concept {{was developed by}} MIT students a successful round of funding and first production run through Kickstarter. The goals for Autosprout are to fully automate the manufacturing process, and to reduce the manufacturing costs from eighty cents per pencil to less than thirty, while also producing a completely assembled pencil every five seconds. The original assembly process was slow and required a lot of manpower. However, it laid a foundation to design the automated process described in this thesis. The new system will feature two carousel systems. The first carousel will load the <b>cedar</b> <b>pencil,</b> cut a shoulder using a specially designed router, and finally add a dab of glue around the shoulder. The second carousel will load a pill capsule body and fill it with soil and two to three seeds. At {{the end of each}} carousel process the pill capsule and pencil will come together and the capsule will be placed onto the shoulder and the glue will hold it in place. Before the capsule is loaded into the carousel, it must be sorted and properly aligned. Models for a vibratory feeder were first designed and tested, but, due to the inconsistent performance of the models, an industrial vibratory feeder was purchased and modified. The modification consists of a chute leading to a vacuum system that removes the capsule from the feeder, rotates, and finally loads the capsule into the carousel by switching a valve making the vacuum into a stream of high air pressure. A similar system will be used for removing seeds from a hopper and placing them in the capsule. by Eric A. Del Castillo. Thesis (S. B.)
