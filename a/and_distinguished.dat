Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism, <b>and</b> <b>distinguished</b> itself by the emotional intensity of its liberationist vision. It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution, and elevated the role of violence as a revolutionary instrument.|$|E
