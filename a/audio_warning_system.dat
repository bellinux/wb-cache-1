40|$|Speeding {{is a major}} {{contributing}} factor to traffic crashes and frequently happens in areas {{where there is a}} mutation in speed limits, such as the transition zones that connect urban areas from rural areas. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effects of an in-vehicle <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> and lit speed limit sign on preventing drivers’ speeding behavior in transition zones. A high-fidelity driving simulator was used to establish a roadway network with the transition zone. A total of 41 participants were recruited for this experiment, and the driving speed performance data were collected from the simulator. The experimental results display that the implementation of the <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> could significantly reduce drivers’ operating speed before they entered the urban area, while the lit speed limit sign had a minimal effect on improving the drivers’ speed control performance. Without consideration of different types of speed limit signs, it is found that male drivers generally had a higher operating speed both upstream and in the transition zones and have a larger maximum deceleration for speed reduction than female drivers. Moreover, the drivers who had medium-level driving experience had the higher operating speed and were more likely to have speeding behaviors in the transition zones than those who had low-level and high-level driving experience in the transition zones...|$|E
40|$|Car Driver Assisted for Blind Spot System is invented {{to observe}} the blind spot region and alert the driver {{automatically}} to ensure the driver safety on highway due to the driver inability {{to observe the}} blind spot area directly which had caused many accident occur. Eventually, the system is built {{from a combination of}} a circuit and programming software of microcontroller and ultrasonic sensor. In this project, 2 ultrasonic sensors will be put at the right side of a car because the risk of danger in the blind spot is higher at the driver side. The sensors will be put on the lateral side of the front and rear side of a car to check the incoming vehicle at the blind spot. The sensors will be activated at a certain speed and when both sensors detect a vehicle at the blind spot, a warning system will trigger. An indicator light or LED located at the side mirror will be used as visual warning system while a buzzer will be used as <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> which can be install inside the car. Hence, the system will help a driver to drive safely and prevent any fatal accident involving blind spot. As the result, the statistic for accident can be lower. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{collision}} avoidance <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> is an emerging technology designed to assist drivers in avoiding red-light running (RLR) collisions at intersections. The {{aim of this}} paper is to evaluate the effect of auditory warning information on {{collision avoidance}} behaviors in the RLR pre-crash scenarios and further to examine the casual relationships among the relevant factors. A driving-simulator-based experiment was designed and conducted with 50 participants. The data from the experiments were analyzed by approaches of ANOVA and structural equation modeling (SEM). The collisions avoidance related variables were measured in terms of brake reaction time (BRT), maximum deceleration and lane deviation in this study. It was found that the collision avoidance <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> can result in smaller collision rates compared to the without-warning condition and lead to shorter reaction times, larger maximum deceleration and less lane deviation. Furthermore, the SEM analysis illustrate that the <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> information in fact has both direct and indirect effect on occurrence of collisions, and the indirect effect plays a more important role on collision avoidance than the direct effect. Essentially, the auditory warning information can assist drivers in detecting the RLR vehicles in a timely manner, thus providing drivers more adequate time and space to decelerate to avoid collisions with the conflicting vehicles...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effect ICWSs on drivers’ behavior, in response to a potential conflict event at the intersections; in this case, a violator vehicle from right and left that failed to stop represented the potential conflict. The ICWSs were <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> message and visual <b>warning.</b> Both the <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> message and the visual warning provided to the driver the direction of the violator vehicle. Drivers’ reaction times were modeled following the survival analysis, by the use of the accelerated failure time (AFT) duration model with a Weibull distribution. The applied model identified one significant variable influencing the reaction time (Vi driver’s initial speed value) and the warning signal condition; the direction of the violator vehicle did not affect significantly the reaction time of drivers. For the condition of <b>audio</b> message <b>warning</b> and visual warning, the reaction time was 43. 1 % and 34. 5 % shorter than that for the baseline condition, respectively. In addition, the drivers’ reaction time for the <b>audio</b> message <b>warning</b> was 22 % shorter than that for the visual warning (statistically significant) ...|$|R

The physical simulator is a modified automobile cab instrumented to provide driver activity information and in-vehicle warnings that accurately reflect the performance of proposed sensors during defined scenarios. The simulation computing architecture uses a distributed multi-CPU environment to support six out-the-window displays, a head-up and a head-down display, six channels of audio output, and software to control the simulation and produce warnings. Planned evaluation with a population of subjects in a variety of scenarios will determine the best <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for use in prototype vehicles.

40|$|Community-based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> involve {{community}} driven {{collection and}} analysis of information that enable warning messages to help a community to react to a hazard and reduce the resulting loss or harm. Most early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> are designed at the national or global level. Local communities’ capacity to predict weather conditions using indigenous knowledge has been demonstrated in studies focusing on climate change and agriculture in some African countries. This review was motivated by successes made in non-disease specific community-based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> {{with a view to}} identify opportunities for developing similar systems for malaria. This article reviewed the existing community-based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> documented in literature. The types of disasters that are addressed by these systems and the methodologies utilised {{in the development of the}} systems were identified. The review showed that most of the documented community-based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> focus on natural disasters such as floods, drought, and landslides. Community-based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for human diseases are very few, even though such systems exist at national and regional and global levels.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a non-exhausting overview of early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for emerging foodborne hazards that are {{operating in the}} various places in the world. Special attention is given to endpoint-focussed early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> (i. e. ECDC, ISIS and GPHIN) and hazard-focussed early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> (i. e.

40|$|Effective drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> are an {{integral}} part of efforts worldwide to improve drought preparedness. Timely and reliable data and information must be the cornerstone of effective drought policies and plans. In pursuit of the goal of improving the effectiveness of drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems,</b> participants of the experts meeting were asked to address three fundamental questions: 1. What is your assessment of the current status of drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems?</b> 2. What are the shortcomings, limitations, and needs for drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems?</b> 3. How can drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> be improved to better support drought preparedness and mitigation efforts at the local, national, and international level? Participants identified the primary users of data and information derived from drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> as a first step in evaluating the status of early <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b> Users were diverse, including government agencies, farmers, extension services, insurance companies, media, donors, NGOs, and the general public. Leadership for drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> is provided principally by meteorological or agricultural services. In general, where meteorological services were the lead agency, the information tended to be more meteorologically based. In contrast, leadership for drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> that were more agriculturally based tended to take a more multidisciplinary or integrated approach to monitoring. An integrated approach is considered preferable because information from all elements of the hydrologic system must be considered to obtain a comprehensive assessment of climate and water supply conditions. Although forecasting and monitoring are considered critical components of all early <b>warning</b> <b>systems,</b> there appeared to be little evidence of the beneficial use of that information by farmers. It was noted that few countries currently have a national drought policy in place. Australia is an exception and progress in South Africa and the United States was noted. It was apparent that other countries were moving in the direction of a national drought policy. In some instances, subnational policies were in existence. Comprehensive early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> should be the foundation on which national drought policies and plans are constructed. Although many countries have some type of drought early <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> in place, these systems are not comprehensive and have very limited financial and human resource inputs...|$|R
