50|$|An <b>anti-scratch</b> or {{scratch-resistant}} coating {{is a film}} or coating {{that can be applied}} to optical surfaces, such as the faces of a lens or photographic film. The coating does not interfere with how the lens functions and does not affect vision, but creates a permanent bond with the lens that reduces the appearance of hairline scratches which is common to eyeglass lenses. Though an <b>anti-scratch</b> coating is not 100% scratch-proof, it helps to prevent minor scratches that can easily happen to a regular lens. These minor scratches can damage the surface of the lens and impair vision. An <b>anti-scratch</b> coating acts as a protective layer thus making the lenses more durable and safe.|$|E

40|$|The unique {{physical}} and chemical properties of nanomaterials have led to their increased use in many industrial applications, including as a paint additive. For example, titanium dioxide (TiO 2) engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) have well-established anti-UV, self-cleaning, and air purification effects. Silver (Ag) ENPs are renowned for their anti-microbial capabilities and silicon dioxide (SiO 2) ENPs are used as fire retardants and <b>anti-scratch</b> coatings. In this study, the toxic effects and biodistribution of three pristine ENPs (TiO 2, Ag, and SiO 2), three aged paints containing ENPs (TiO 2, Ag, and SiO 2) along with control paints without ENPs were compared. BALB/c mice were oropharyngeally aspirated with ENPs or paint particles (20 μg/aspiration) once a week for 5 weeks and sacrificed either 2 or 28 days post final aspiration treatment. A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and systemic blood toxicity was evaluated to ascertain cell counts, induction of inflammatory cytokines, and key blood parameters. In addition, the lung, liver, kidney, spleen, and heart were harvested and metal concentrations were determined. Exposure to pristine ENPs caused subtle effects in the lungs and negligible alterations in the blood. The most pronounced toxic effects were observed after Ag ENPs exposure; an increased neutrophil count and a twofold increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC) and interleukin- 1 ß (IL- 1 ß)) were identified. The paint containing TiO 2 ENPs did not modify macrophage and neutrophil counts, but mildly induced KC and IL- 1 ß. The paints containing Ag or SiO 2 did not show significant toxicity. Biodistribution experiments showed distribution of Ag and Si outside the lung after aspiration to respectively pristine Ag or SiO 2 ENPs. In conclusion, we demonstrated that even though direct exposure to ENPs induced some toxic effects, once they were embedded in a complex paint matrix little to no adverse toxicological effects were identified. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the {{particular}} context of cultural heritage, protective glazing {{has been the}} subject of only few studies [1 - 2]. In addition to the monitoring of temperature, humidity and light in museums, the conditions of conservation for the preservation of cultural heritage, needs the development of a low cost glass with specific properties. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is one of the most widely used compounds in the manufacture of organic glasses. Indeed it has a refractive index (n = 1. 491) close to that of glass (n = 1. 522), it has a better light transmission and is much lighter and less brittle than glass. Therefore it has been widely applied in conservation for the glassing of artifacts and especially during travelling exhibitions. PMMA is also still used by many artists to produce artworks such as Diasec© (a popular face mounting techniques for photographs), 3 D objects and design furnitures. Unfortunately PMMA is very sensitive to abrasion and after a few years this might alter the visual appearance of the artifact. This work shows the possibility to enhance <b>anti-scratch</b> and solvents resistance of PMMA based glass by combining it with polycarbonate (PCR 39 ®) inside Interpenetrating Polymer Network (IPN) architecture. Our specifications require a transparent final material and a preparation without solvent in order to address specific issue of the cultural heritage preservation community. These IPNs are synthesized according to an in situ process. According to the chosen free-radical initiators, the PMMA network is formed in the first place followed by the synthesis of PCR 39 ® network. Rigid transparent (transmission higher than 95 %) materials are obtained. Thermomechanical analyses indicate a correct interpenetration of both networks.

40|$|DoctorBlock {{copolymers}} {{have been}} widely employed to develop functional materials with nanostructure due to its characteristic microphase behavior. Especially, polystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) copolymer {{has been used for}} various functional nanostructure because of its capability of selective removal of PMMA in block copolymer. In this thesis, interesting porous structures were fabricated based on PS-b-PMMA and analyzed with arising analytical techniques like electron tomography, X-ray tools, and optical analysis. And the porous materials are applied to antireflection coating. In chapter 2, cylindrical nanoporous structures were prepared by using a mixture film of PS-b-PMMA and PMMA homopolymer (hPMMA), and they were analyzed by transmission electron microtomography (TEMT), X-ray reflectivity (XR), and grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering. For this purpose, the mixture film was spin-coated onto a silicon wafer modified by a neutral brush for PS and PMMA blocks, which generates PMMA cylindrical microdomains oriented normal to the substrate. Two methods were employed to prepare nanoporous structures: (1) all the PMMA phase (PMMA block and PMMA homopolymer) in the film was removed by UV irradiation followed by rinsing with a selective solvent (acetic acid) to PMMAand (2) only PMMA homopolymer was removed by the selective solvent etching without UV irradiation. We found via TEMT and XR that the nanoporous structure in the film prepared by UV irradiation exhibited almost perfect cylindrical shape throughout the entire film thickness. On the other hand, when the film was rinsed with a selective solvent, nanoporous structures were not straight cylinders, but exhibited a funnel shape that the diameter of nanopores located {{near the top of the}} film was larger than that located near the bottom of the film. In chapter 3, broadband antireflection (AR) covering from visible light to near infrared (NIR) wavelengths (400 ~ 2000 nm) was obtained out by using three sequential spin coatings of PS-b-PMMA with different volume fractions of PMMA block (fPMMA) on a glass. PS-b-PMMA having the lowest PMMA volume fraction (fPMMA ~ 0. 3) among three PS-b-PMMAs was first spin-coated on a glass substrate. After spin-coating, the film was irradiated by ozone to prevent dissolution during the next spin-coating process. Then, PS-b-PMMA with the next larger volume fraction of PMMA block (fPMMA ~ 0. 46) was spin-coated, and irradiated again by ozone. Finally, PS-b-PMMA with the largest volume fraction of PMMA block (fPMMA ~ 0. 69) was spin-coated. After three sequential spin-coatings, the entire film was irradiated under UV followed by rinsing with acetic acid, which removed PMMA blocks. This process allowed us to have the triple layers with sponge-like nanoporous structures that the refractive index increases from the top to the bottom of the film. The morphology of the triple-layered nanoporous block copolymer films was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The nanoporous film exhibited excellent broadband AR at wavelengths from 400 and 2000 nm. The measured reflectance curves are in good agreement with the calculation from the characteristic matrix theory. This AR coating would be used for the development of solar cells with high power convergence efficiency. In chapter 4, we prepared an inorganic nanoporous film with dense skin layer by using sponge-like nanoporous block copolymer template. After spin coating of PS-b-PMMA with 0. 46 of PMMA volume fraction, PMMA block was selectively removed by UV irradiation. With this nanoporous template, silica precursor was spincoated followed by high temperature thermal treatment for silica conversion. The product showed interesting porous structure consisted of a dense silica dense skin layer on a sponge-like nanoporous layer. At visible light range, it showed low reflectance under 1 %. The measured reflectance curves were good agreement with the calculation from characteristic matrix theory. And from pencil hardness test, this silica porous strcuture showed great increase of its mechanical strength than PS-b-PMMA porous film.

40|$|This project mainly {{concerned}} {{the development of}} novel engineering approaches to optimise the physical properties of the polymer composites with a low loading of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). It was additionally discovered that graphite oxide nanoplatelets (GONPs) can be a strong and affordable substitute for the CNTs in the polymer composites. Colloidal physics and coating methods were applied to fabricate semi-conductive CNT/polymer composites with low percolation threshold. Polyurethane (PU) latex and {{ultra high molecular weight}} polyethylene (UHWMPE) powder were used as hosting matrix in the colloidal physics method and coating method, respectively. In the colloidal physics method, the percolation threshold was found to be around O. 5 wt% MWCNTs and the electrical conductivity of the composites was improved by more than four orders of magnitude with the addition of I wt % multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The study of rheological behaviour revealed that the addition of the MWCNTs led to the increase in the viscosity of the PU dispersion. In the coating method, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images confirmed the strong adhesion of the nanotubes {{on the surface of the}} powders. Sheet samples were prepared using compression moulding for electrical test. The percolation threshold for the powders with the size of 60) lm was around I wt% MWCNTs and the percolation threshold for the powders with the size of 100) lm was around 0. 5 wt% MWCNTs. A novel route was revealed to reduce the interfacial phonon scattering that is considered as the bottleneck for CNTs to highly improve the thermal conductivity of CNT/polymer composites. Semicrystalline PU dispersions were used as latex host to accommodate the MWCNTs following the colloidal physics method. The thermal conductivity increased from 0. 15 Wm-'K-' to 0. 47 Wm-'K", by - 210 %, as the addition of the MWCNTs increased to 3 wt%. The morphology of the composites suggested that the continuous nanotube-rich phase existing in the interstitial space among the latex particles and the crystaIIites nucleated at the nanotube-polymer interface were the main factors for the effective reduction of interfacial phonon scattering. The optimisation of the crystalline layer around CNTs was studied based on the MWCNT/polycapro!actone (PCL) composites using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The study of the non-isothermal crystaIlisation showed that crystaIIisation temperature (Tc) increased with increasing incorporation of the nanotubes, and melting temperature (T m) and heat of fusion (ilHm) was almost unchanged. The incorporation of 2 wt% nanotubes resulted in the biggest increase of the T c to be - 11 QC. The study of the isothermal crystaIIisation showed the temperature, 14 DC higher than the Tc. was appropriate one to optimise the crystaIIine layer in the composite melts. It was revealed that the incorporation of 0. 1 wt% nanotubes significantly affected the rate of crystal growth and crystalline morphology. For more incorporation of the nanotubes, the rate of crystal growth and crystaIIine morphology was less affected. The improvement in the Young's modulus of the composite with the thermal treatment confirmed the contribution of the crystalline layer to the load transfer across the non-covalent interface between the nanotube and polymer matrix. The preparation of the exfoliated GONPs in DMF was revealed. With this method in hand, two kinds of polymers including semi-crystaIline PCL and amorphous PU were selected to be incorporated with the GONPs using the solution method. It was found that the GONPs showed strong nucleating ability in the PCL matrix. The thermal treatment under the " 14 QC" rule could create an optimised crystalline layer on the surface of the GONPs from the composite melts. The bigger increase in the Young's modulus of the treated GONPIPCL composites confirmed that the crystaIIine layer nucleated on the surface of the GONPs could act as a non-covalent interface between the GONPs and PCL matrix. The significant reinforcement of the PU using GONPs was also disclosed. Morphologic studies showed thai, due to the formation of chemical bonding, strong interaction occurred between the GONPs and the hard segment ofthe PU, which allowed effective load transfer. The GONPs can prevent the formation of crystalline hard segments due to their two-dimensional structure. With the incorporation of 4. 4 wt% graphite oxide nanoplatelets, the Young's modulus and hardness of the PU were significantly increased by - 900 % and - 327 %, respectively. The resultant high <b>anti-scratch</b> property pointed to the promising application of these composite materials in surface coating. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
