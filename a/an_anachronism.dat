5|$|For many, the Vatican's actions {{encapsulated}} {{all that}} {{was wrong with the}} Papal States and exposed pontifical rule as <b>an</b> <b>anachronism.</b> Several historians highlight the affair {{as one of the most}} significant events of Pius IX's papacy, and juxtapose his handling of it in 1858 with the loss of most of his territory a year later. The case notably altered the policy of the French Emperor Napoleon III, who shifted from opposing the movement for Italian unification to actively supporting it. The traditional Italian historiography of unification does not give much prominence to the Mortara case, which by the late 20th century was remembered mostly by Jewish scholars, but a 1997 study by the American historian David Kertzer has marked the start of a wider re-examination.|$|E
5|$|The Great Hall, {{leading off}} from the corridor, was the most {{important}} communal eating and living room, but by the time Montacute was completed the traditional Great Hall was largely <b>an</b> <b>anachronism.</b> Such halls continued to be built, however, albeit as at Montacute on a smaller scale. For the first few years after its completion, the servants continued to dine in the hall, but the family and honoured guests now ate in the Great Chamber above. The hall now served as a room to receive and also for processions to commence to the grander rooms above.|$|E
5|$|Various wedding {{guests are}} {{depicted}} in the scene. Shiva's attendant ganas enjoy the festivities; playing drums or dancing. The vahanas (vehicles) of the couple, Shiva's bull Nandi and Parvati's lion, are sometimes pictured in the scene. In vertical panel depictions, the celestial guests are often shown flying over Shiva and Parvati. While the gods are pictured flying on their respective vahanas (e.g. Indra on his elephant, Agni on a ram) and with their consorts; semi-divine beings like Vidyadharas fly without vehicles. <b>An</b> <b>anachronism</b> found in a few Kalyanasundara scenes {{is the presence of}} the yet-unborn children of Shiva and Parvati, Ganesha and Kartikkeya. Examples of this anachronism are found at the Rameshvara Cave of Ellora, and in a 9th-century sculpture from Uttar Pradesh now housed in Los Angeles County Museum of Art.|$|E
5000|$|In Sergio Sollima's 1967 Spaghetti Western film Face to Face, a {{character}} patterned after Siringo (but {{with his first}} name being spelled [...] "Charley") is portrayed by William Berger. Siringo's appearance in the film is <b>a</b> <b>anachronism</b> as Face to Face {{takes place in the}} American Civil War, when the real Siringo was only a child.|$|R

25|$|Linking the {{political}} and intercommunal schism in Identity politics was criticized by conservative intellectuals. It was argued that Mizrahi identity is <b>an</b> <b>anachronism</b> which endangers the Israeli melting pot.|$|E
25|$|Stamp duties are a {{group of}} federal taxes levied on certain {{commercial}} transactions. The name is <b>an</b> <b>anachronism</b> and {{dates back to the}} time when such taxes were administered with physical stamps.|$|E
5000|$|The programme, almost uniquely, {{has used}} the same theme music since its {{inception}} - [...] "Out of the Blue", written by Hubert Bath. This already sounded old-fashioned in the early 1970s, and {{it is said that}} Lynam prevented it from being dropped. Now, the theme has the status of <b>a</b> charming <b>anachronism,</b> <b>a</b> very British institution, amid the fast-paced modern style of the rest of Five Live.|$|R

25|$|The side-lever {{engine was}} a {{paddlewheel}} engine {{and was not}} suitable for driving screw propellers. The last ship built for transatlantic service to be fitted with a side-lever engine was the Cunard Line's paddle steamer , considered <b>an</b> <b>anachronism</b> when it entered service in 1862.|$|E
25|$|G. Wissowa {{advanced}} {{the hypothesis that}} Semo Sancus is the genius of Jupiter. W. W. Fowler has cautioned that this interpretation looks to be <b>an</b> <b>anachronism</b> and {{it would only be}} acceptable to say that Sancus is a Genius Iovius, as it appears from the Iguvine Tables.|$|E
25|$|Daughter of an {{unsuccessful}} Birmingham car salesman Lady Docker {{could see that}} the Daimler cars, no longer popular with the royal family, were in danger of becoming <b>an</b> <b>anachronism</b> in the modern world. She took it upon herself to raise Daimler's profile, but in an extravagant fashion, by encouraging Sir Bernard to produce show cars.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of camels in Mesopotamia {{but not in}} Israel {{is not a new}} idea. The historian Richard Bulliet did not think that the occasional mention of camels meant that the domestic camels were common in the Holy Land at that time. The archaeologist William F. Albright writing even earlier saw camels in the Bible as <b>an</b> <b>anachronism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gibraltar was {{nominated}} {{to be included}} on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories by the United Kingdom when the list was created in 1946 and has been listed ever since. The government of Gibraltar has actively worked to have Gibraltar removed from the list, and in 2008 the British government declared Gibraltar's continued presence on the list <b>an</b> <b>anachronism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Once, the Social Register was a juggernaut in New York social circles....Nowadays, however, {{with the}} waning of the WASP elite {{as a social}} and {{political}} force, the register's role as an arbiter of who counts and who doesn't is almost <b>an</b> <b>anachronism.</b> In Manhattan, where charity galas {{are at the center}} of the social season, the organizing committees are studded with luminaries from publishing, Hollywood and Wall Street and family lineage is almost irrelevant.|$|E

25|$|In {{the context}} of artistic movements, Harvey Quaytman was {{considered}} <b>an</b> <b>anachronism.</b> During his career, from the late 1960s to late 1990s, he continued to relentlessly explore Geometric Abstraction and Modernism - fields in which the innovation had been considered largely developed {{by the end of}} the 1950s and 1960s. Yet he pushed ahead, and according to critics he became bolder over time - more innovative, assured and successful in each decade. Even in his later years, he was recognized for finding dynamic, new forms of abstraction.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, the {{independent}} City of Alexandria annexed the small Fairfax County portion of Fairlington, rendering the name <b>an</b> <b>anachronism.</b> In 1966, a mutual agreement between Arlington and Alexandria adjusted the city-county boundary through North Fairlington that {{had followed the}} original District of Columbia-Virginia line. The new boundary followed {{the north and east}} sides of State Route 7 (King Street), 30th Street South, South Columbus Street, and 28th Street South. In 1954, the well-preserved Fort Reynolds was leveled to construct the Park Shirlington apartments.|$|E
25|$|On 31 January 1963, the {{committee}} of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) agreed unanimously to abolish the concept of amateurism and all first-class cricketers became professional. The Gentlemen v Players fixture was by then viewed as <b>an</b> <b>anachronism</b> and was discontinued. A substitute fixture was sought but never instituted as the limited overs Gillette Cup competition began in 1963. A total of 274 Gentlemen v Players matches were played from 1806 to 1962. The Players won 125 and the Gentlemen 68. There were 80 draws and one tie.|$|E
50|$|However, this is <b>a</b> late <b>anachronism</b> as Senach died in 610, {{which was}} 27 {{years before the}} battle. The Bishop of Armagh {{at the time of}} the battle of Moira was Tómméne.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a review}} of the book, CNN declared: [...] "As more voters, politicos and talk-show hosts write off affirmative action as <b>a</b> well-intentioned <b>anachronism,</b> <b>A</b> Hope in the Unseen should be {{required}} reading for would-be opinion-mongers." [...] In his review for Newsday, Bill Reel stated [...] "I changed my thinking about affirmative action. I was against it, now I am for it. The agent of change was a mind-opening book—A Hope in the Unseen by Ron Suskind." ...|$|R

25|$|Given these {{assumptions}} {{he argues that}} the calculated date of Wednesday 1 April AD33 for the Last Supper allows all four gospel accounts to be astronomically correct, with Jesus celebrating Passover two days before his death according to the original Mosaic calendar, and the Jewish authorities celebrating Passover just after the crucifixion, using the modified Babylonian calendar. In contrast, the Christian church tradition of celebrating the Last Supper on Maundy Thursday would be <b>an</b> <b>anachronism.</b> The calculated chronology incidentally supports John's narrative that Jesus died at the same hour (Friday 3pm) on 3 April AD33 that the Passover lambs were slaughtered.|$|E
25|$|Hewett {{continued}} {{to work as a}} field archaeologist practically until his death. However, by the 1930s his basically romantic approach to field work was looking like more and more of <b>an</b> <b>anachronism.</b> His responsibilities at the University of New Mexico grew less demanding (and conspicuous) over time, although he retained directorship of the Chaco Canyon field school, a particular favorite of his, until 1937. He continued in his roles at the SAR and the Museum of New Mexico until {{the last year of his}} life, chairing the joint meeting of the managing board in August 1946.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, {{there are}} traces of {{cremation}} {{dating to the}} Early Bronze Age (c. 2000 BCE) in the Pannonian Plain and along the middle Danube. The custom became dominant throughout Bronze Age Europe with the Urnfield culture (from c. 1300 BCE). In the Iron Age, inhumation again becomes more common, but cremation persisted in the Villanovan culture and elsewhere. Homer's account of Patroclus' burial describes cremation with subsequent burial in a tumulus, similar to Urnfield burials, and qualifying as the earliest description of cremation rites. This may be <b>an</b> <b>anachronism,</b> as during Mycenaean times burial was generally preferred, and Homer may have been reflecting the more common use of cremation {{at the time the}} Iliad was written, centuries later.|$|E

5000|$|The name [...] "Ise Province" [...] {{continued}} to exist as <b>a</b> geographical <b>anachronism</b> for certain official purposes. For example, Ise is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 (a) between Japan and the United States and (b) between Japan and the United Kingdom.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the word}} [...] "galleys" [...] was still used {{until the late}} 19th century to {{designate}} the French Bagnios, the actual penalty of sending someone to the galleys was abolished in mid-18th century. The galleys portrayed in this film are <b>a</b> huge <b>anachronism.</b>|$|R
