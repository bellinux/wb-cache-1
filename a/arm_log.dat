40|$|We {{conducted}} a prospectively randomised clinical trial {{to investigate the}} role of adjuvant outpatient immunochemotherapy administered postoperatively in high-risk patients with renal cell carcinoma. In total, 203 renal carcinoma patients' status post radical tumour nephrectomy were stratified into three risk groups: patients with tumour extending into renal vein/vena cava or invading beyond Gerota's fascia (pT 3 b/c pN 0 or pT 4 pN 0), patients with locoregional lymph node infiltration (pN+), and patients after complete resection of tumour relapse or solitary metastasis (R 0). Patients were randomised to undergo either (A) 8 weeks of outpatient subcutaneous interleukin- 2 (sc-rIL- 2), subcutaneous interferon-alpha 2 a (sc-rIFN-α 2 a), and intravenous 5 -fluorouracil (iv- 5 -FU) according to the standard Atzpodien regimen (Atzpodien et al, 2004) or (B) observation.

40|$|Abstract Background Advanced {{pancreatic}} cancer has a poor prognosis, {{and the current}} standard of care (gemcitabine based chemotherapy) provides a small survival advantage. However the drawback is the accompanying systemic toxicity, which targeted treatments may overcome. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KAb 201, an anti-carcinoembryonic antigen monoclonal antibody, labelled with I 131 in {{pancreatic cancer}} (ISRCTN 16857581). Methods Patients with histological/cytological proven inoperable adenocarcinoma {{of the head of}} pancreas were randomised to receive KAb 201 via either the intra-arterial or intravenous delivery route. The dose limiting toxicities within each group were determined. Patients were assessed for safety and efficacy and followed up until death. Results Between February 2003 and July 2005, 25 patients were enrolled. Nineteen patients were randomised, 9 to the intravenous and 10 to the intra-arterial arms. In the intra-arterial arm, dose limiting toxicity was seen in 2 / 6 (33 %) patients at 50 mCi whereas in the intravenous arm, dose limiting toxicity was noted in 1 / 6 patients at 50 mCi, but did not occur at 75 mCi (0 / 3). The overall response rate was 6 % (1 / 18).

Methods and Findings: Adult patients with laboratory evidence of PHI were recruited in 13 HIV treatment centers in the Netherlands and randomly assigned to receive no treatment or 24 or 60 wk of cART (allocation in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio); if therapy was clinically indicated, participants were randomized over the two treatment arms (allocation in a 1 : 1 ratio). Primary end points were (1) viral set point, defined as the plasma viral load 36 wk after randomization in the no treatment arm and 36 wk after treatment interruption in the treatment arms, and (2) the total time that patients were off therapy, defined as the time between randomization and start of cART in the no treatment arm, and the time between treatment interruption and restart of cART in the treatment arms. cART was (re) started in case of confirmed CD 4 cell count < 350 cells/mm 3 or symptomatic HIV disease. In total, 173 participants were randomized. The modified intention-to-treat analysis comprised 168 patients: 115 were randomized over the three study arms, and 53 randomized over the two treatment arms. Of the 115 patients randomized over the three study arms, mean viral set point was 4. 8 (standard deviation 0. 6) log 10 copies/ml in the no treatment arm, and 4. 0 (1. 0) and 4. 3 (0. 9) log 10 copies/ml in the 24 - and 60 -wk treatment arms (between groups: p< 0. 001).

40|$|Background. Vicriviroc (VCV) is a CCR 5 {{antagonist}} with nanomolar activity against {{human immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) replication in vitro and in vivo. We report {{the results of a}} phase II dose-finding study of VCV plus dual nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in the treatment-naive HIV- 1 -infected subjects. Methods. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that began with a 14 -day comparison of 3 dosages of VCV with placebo in treatment-naive subjects infected with CCR 5 -using HIV- 1. After 14 days of monotherapy, lamivudine/zidovudine was added to the VCV arms; subjects receiving placebo were treated with efavirenz and lamivudine/zidovudine; the planned treatment duration was 48 weeks. Results. Ninety-two subjects enrolled. After 14 days of once-daily monotherapy, the mean viral loads decreased from baseline values by 0. 07 log 10 copies/mL in the placebo <b>arm,</b> 0. 93 <b>log</b> 10 copies/mL in theVCV 25 mg <b>arm,</b> 1. 18 <b>log</b> 10 copies/mL in the VCV 50 mg arm, and 1. 34 log 10 copies/mL in the VCV 75 mg arm (P <. 001 for each VCV arm vs. the placebo arm). The combination-therapy portion of the study was stopped because of increased rates of virologic failure in the VCV 25 mg/day arm (relative hazard [RH], 21. 6; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 8 - 168. 9) and the VCV 50 mg/day arm (RH, 11. 7; 95 % CI, 1. 5 - 92. 9), compared with that in the control arm. Conclusion. VCV administered with dual NRTIs in treatment-naive subjects with HIV- 1 infection had increased rates of virologic failure, compared with efavirenz plus dual NRTIs.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness training (CBT/MT) on attentional task performance in incarcerated adolescents. Attention is a cognitive system necessary for managing cognitive demands and regulating emotions. Yet persistent and intensive demands, such as those experienced during high-stress intervals like incarceration and the events leading to incarceration, may deplete attention resulting in cognitive failures, emotional disturbances, and impulsive behavior. We hypothesized that CBT/MT may mitigate these deleterious effects of high stress and protect against degradation in attention over the high-stress interval of incarceration. Using a group randomized controlled trial design, we randomly assigned dormitories of incarcerated youth, ages 16 to 18, to a CBT/MT intervention (youth n = 147) or an active control intervention (youth n = 117). Both arms received approximately 750 minutes of intervention in a small-group setting over a 3 - 5 week period. Youth in the CBT/MT <b>arm</b> also <b>logged</b> the amount of out-of-session time spent practicing MT exercises. The Attention Network Test was used to index attentional task performance at baseline and 4 months post-baseline. Overall, task performance degraded over time in all participants. The magnitude of performance degradation was significantly less in the CBT/MT vs. control arm. Further, within the CBT/MT arm, performance degraded over time in those with no outside-of-class practice time, but remained stable over time in those who practiced mindfulness exercises outside of the session meetings. Thus, {{these findings suggest that}} sufficient CBT/MT practice may protect against functional attentional impairments associated with high-stress intervals.

Metsähovi radio observatory has proposed a project named Metsähovi compact array to build four radio telescopes {{in order to create}} new research platform in different areas, such as radio astronomy, solar research, and space physics. In this master thesis work, a wide band feed for the reflector antenna of the proposed radio telescope is analyzed and designed. Initially several solutions are studied and analyzed.

Moreover, the antenna is also simulated with the bifilar lines to have an practical feeding system of the antenna. In this case the results shows poor performance due to the significant radiation coming out from the bifilar lines which is overlapping with the antenna radiation. To avoid this radiation, a hollow metal is introduced which covers the bifilar lines to block the radiation coming out from the bifilar lines. The antenna performance with bifilar lines satisfies most of the requirements that has set up for this work.

SETTING: 93 hospitals throughout United Kingdom. SUBJECTS: 520 patients with early Parkinson's disease {{who were not}} receiving dopaminergic treatment. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (arm 1) or levodopa and decarboxylase inhibitor in combination with selegiline (arm 2). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessments of serial disability, frequency and severity of adverse events, and deaths from all causes. RESULTS: After average of 5 - 6 years' follow up, mortality ratio in arm 2 compared with arm 1 was 1. 57 (95 % confidence interval 1. 09 to 2. 30), and difference in survival between the two <b>arms</b> was significant (<b>log</b> rank test, P = 0. 015). Hazard ratio adjusted for age and sex was 1. 49 (1. 02 to 2. 16), and after adjustment for other baseline factors it increased to 1. 57 (1. 07 to 2. 31). Patients in arm 1 had slightly worse disability scores than those in arm 2, but differences were not significant. Functionally disabling peak dose dyskinesias and on/off fluctuations were more frequent in arm 2 than arm 1. During the trial the dose of levodopa required to produce optimum motor control steadily increased in arm 1 (median daily dose 375 mg at 1 year and 625 mg at 4 years), but median dose in arm 2 did not change (375 mg). CONCLUSIONS: Levodopa in combination with selegiline seemed to confer no clinical benefit over levodopa alone in treating early, mild Parkinson's disease.

To further define treatment responses to new antiretroviral therapy in patients with long-term experience to dual nucleoside analog therapy (zidovu-dine [ZDV] plus didanosine [ddI] or ZDV plus zalcitabine [ddC]), 325 subjects derived from the AIDS Clin-ical Trials Group (ACTG) 175 trial were randomized to three different combination regimens: (1) continua-tion of ZDV 1 ddI or ZDV 1 ddC (continuation arm), (2) addition of 3 TC to ZDV 1 ddI or ZDV 1 ddC (addition arm), or (3) a switch to ZDV 1 3 TC therapy (switch arm). Both the addition and switch arms sus-tained significantly greater short-term (baseline to week 4) mean CD 4 1 cell count increases compared with the continuation arm (1 36, 1 28 versus 2 4 cells/mm 3; p 5 0. 012) and long-term CD 4 1 cell count responses (baseline to weeks 40 / 48 : 1 32, 1 19 versus 2 9 cells/mm 3; p 5 0. 003). Superior short-term (baseline to week 8) mean decreases in plasma HIV RNA (p, 0. 001) were achieved by both the addition and switch <b>arms</b> (0. 53 <b>log</b> 10 and 0. 54 log 10 copies/ml, respectively) compared with the continuation arm (0. 13 copies/ml) whereas no differences in long-term virologic suppression were observed (p 5 0. 30). At week 48, no differences were ob-served in the proportions of subjects who had HIV RNA levels below 500 copies/mL: 18 % of subjects in each treatment arm (3 -way p 5 1. 0). Overall, the treatments were well tolerated and only nine subjects (3 %) died or developed one or more AIDS-defining events. While this study confirms the intrinsic antiretroviral activ-ity of 3 TC, only modest marker changes and limited short-term viral suppression are seen with incremental addition of the drug.

Reduction of the nitro groups of this compound by catalytic hydrogenation yields three isomers of the pendant arm macrocyclic complex (6, 13 -diamino- 6, 13 -dimethyl- 1, 4, 8, 11 -tetraazachyclotetradecane) nickel(II) chloride, designated a-, b- and c-[Ni(diam) ]Cl 2. These were separated by fractional crystallization. The aisomer was observed to isomerizes slowly in solution to the b- form. A parallel dissociation {{reaction of}} the a- isomer was also observed. The demetallation of a- and b- isomers of the diam complex of nickel by reaction with cyanide or concentrated acid at 140 degrees C produces the macrocycle meso-(6, 13 -diamino- 6, 13 -dimethyl- 1, 4, 8, 11 -tetraazacyclotetra-decane), diam. A variety of hexamine, pentamine and tetramine complexes of diam with nickel(II), copper(II), cobalt(II) and (III), chromium(III), palladium(II), rhodium(III), zinc(II) and cadmium(II) were prepared. Hexamine and tetramine forms of labile metal complexes could be rapidly and reversibly interconverted by altering the pH. The hexamine cobalt(III) cation, [Co(diam) ] 3 + was by far the most inert of the prepared cobalt(III) complexes, remaining unaffected in hot acidic solutions. In contrast, a single pendant arm of the hexamine [Cr(diam) ] 3 + cation could be dissociated in acid. (Two possibly triamine complexes of lead were also prepared). These compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, magnetic measurements, electronic, infrared, 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The pendant <b>arm</b> protonation constants (<b>log</b> K) of diam and selected complexes of nickel, copper and palladium were calculated from potentiometric titration measurements at 25 degrees C. The log K values for diam at 25 degrees C (I = 0. 1 M NaclO 4) were 11. 15, 9. 7, 6. 2 and 5. 3. Kinetics of the parallel isomerization and dissociation of a-[Ni(dimH 2) ] 4 + in HCl/NaCl solutions were monitored spectrophotometrically at 50 degrees C. The rate of reaction in acidic solutions showed a non-linear dependency on acid concentration. The observed first order rate constant (kobs) for disappearance of a-[Ni(diamH 2) ] 4 + (by isomerization and dissociation) in 2. 0 M HCl, 0. 1 M NaOH and 2. 0 M NaCl were 3. 05 x 10 - 4, 2. 0 (3) x 10 - 2 and 5. 0 x 10 - 5 s- 1 respectively. The rate of the dissociation component of the reaction of a-[Ni(diamH 2) ] 4 + in 2. 0 M HCl at 50 degrees C was 1. 82 x 10 - 7 s- 1. Acid bydrolysis kinetics of (Cu[diamH 2]) (ClO 4) 4 in hydrochloric acid and perchloric acid at 50 and 70 degrees C were studied spectrophotometrically. The reactions were slow and the observed first order rate constants were to a first approximation independent of the particular acid or its concentration. The observed first order rate constants were 1 x 10 - 9 and 8 x 10 - 9 s- 1 at 50 and 70 degrees C respectively.
