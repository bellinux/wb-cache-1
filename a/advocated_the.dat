5|$|Aside from {{overseeing}} the new clergy, Soegijapranata {{continued to work}} towards Catholic education and prosperity, similar to his pre-war work. He emphasised that students must not only be good Catholics, but also good Indonesians. The Church began further development of its schools, ranging from elementary schools to universities. Soegijapranata also began reforming the Church in his apostolic vicariate, making it more Indonesian. He <b>advocated</b> <b>the</b> use of local languages and Indonesian during mass, allowing it throughout his diocese beginning in 1956.

5|$|Chapman also <b>advocated</b> <b>the</b> use {{of white}} footballs and {{numbered}} shirts, {{as well as}} adding hoops to Arsenal's socks {{to make it easier}} for players to pick each other out.

The tradition of both teams walking out together at the FA Cup Final was started in 1930 due to Herbert Chapman's involvement with both clubs, and has continued since.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{attempts}} of the Kirk {{to limit the}} tradition of secular popular music, it continued. This period saw {{the adoption of the}} highland bagpipes and the fiddle. Ballads, some of which probably date from the Medieval period, existed as part of an distinctive oral tradition. Allan Ramsey <b>advocated</b> <b>the</b> creation of a national musical tradition and collaborated with Italian composer and cellist Lorenzo Bocchi on the first Scottish opera the Gentle Shepherd. A musical culture developed around Edinburgh and a number of composers began to produce collections of Lowland and Highland tunes grafted on to Italian musical forms. By the middle of the eighteenth century a number of Italian musicians and composers were resident in Scotland and Scottish composers of national significance had begun to emerge.|$|E
