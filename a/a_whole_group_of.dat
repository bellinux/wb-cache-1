5|$|Brolgas {{are well}} known for their ritualised, {{intricate}} mating dances. The performance begins with a bird picking up some grass and tossing it into the air before catching it in its bill. The bird then jumps a metre (yard) into the air with outstretched wings and continues by stretching its neck, bowing, strutting around, calling and bobbing its head up and down. Sometimes just one brolga dances for its mate; often they dance in pairs; and sometimes <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> about a dozen dance together, lining up roughly opposite each other before they start.|$|E

25|$|In the 16th century, {{the system}} was changed with regard to both cavalry (1536) and {{infantry}} (1544), to provide an army that could be quickly mobilized. This was still done through impressment for the infantry, and tax exemptions for those who financed horsemen. The new system gave the conscripted soldiers a means of subsistence between campaigns, by making <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> farmers responsible for the keep of each soldier. While the soldiers would be hired and salaried full-time if at war, they lived at home and off duty in peacetime. This meant that it would always be possible to raise a trained army in case of war.|$|E

[...] The first game between teams representing the northern and southern halves of Tasmania took place at the oval in August 1923 in front of a crowd of 9,441. A reporter from The Examiner commented: [...] "The oval is in good order and well grassed and the new motor mower copes with the latter very effectively under favourable conditions. The whole five acres can be cut in six hours, as compared with twenty hours by the horse mower." [...] When the ground was harrowed, glass and other debris would surface; a contemporary observer, John Orchard, later remembered: [...] "they'd line up <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> people, perhaps thirty or forty players, and we'd go along with a container alongside each other and we'd pick up everything that was likely to hurt a player." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{second problem}} has been more controversial. The early ethologists assumed that {{communication}} occurred {{for the good of}} the species as a whole, but this would require a process of group selection which is believed to be mathematically impossible in the evolution of sexually reproducing animals. Altruism towards an unrelated group is not widely accepted in the scientific community, but rather can be seen as reciprocal altruism, expecting the same behaviour from others, a benefit of living in a group. Sociobiologists argued that behaviours that benefited <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> animals might emerge as a result of selection pressures acting solely on the individual.

Urwah later fought at the Battle of al-Qadisiyah and died fighting the Daylamites. The Al Jadila tribesmen based in Qinnasrin did not join their Arabian counterparts and fought alongside the Byzantines during the Muslim conquest of Syria. The Muslim general Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah encountered them in their hadir in 638, after which many agreed to convert to Islam, though a large section remained Christian and agreed to pay jizya (poll tax). Most of the Christian tribesmen became Muslims in the few years after, with few exceptions.|$|E

2500|$|The Great Moravian sacral {{architecture}} {{is represented by}} a rich variety of types from three-nave basilicas (Mikulčice III, Bratislava), triconcha (Devín), simple rotunda without apses (Mikulčice VII), two-apses rotunda (Mikulčice VI), tetraconchic rotunda (Mikulčice IX) and <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> one-nave churches and rotundas with one apse.

Mikulčice with 12 churches clearly dominates among all other localities with the first stone churches built around 800 [...] (a potential 13th church is the church [...] Kopčany on Slovak side of the border, but belonging to the Mikulčice agglomeration). The three-nave basilica from Mikulčice with the inside dimensions 35m by 9m and a separate baptistery is also the largest sacral building found. A high concentration of churches in Mikululčice exceeded real needs of the local population and they are interpreted as proprietary churches (Eigenkirchen) known also from the Frankish environment. Large churches were also important ecclesiastical centres of the country. The current dating of several churches precedes the Byzantine mission. The churches were decorated mostly by paintings created by the fresco technique, but usage of secco is also documented. The authors were probably foreign artists from Frankish and North-Italian environment (North-Italian origin is indicated e.g. by chemical composition of paintings in Bratislava and Devín).|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the audio}} {{engineer}} has {{made all the}} adjustments to a signal (e.g., the lead vocalist's singing through a microphone), such as equalization, adding effects, and so on, the signal is then electronically routed to {{a section of the}} mixing console known as [...] "bus", also called a [...] "mix group", [...] "subgroup" [...] or simply [...] "group". A group of signals may be routed through an additional bus before being sent to the main bus to allow the engineer to control the levels of several related signals at once. [...] For example, all of the different microphones for a drum set might be sent to their own bus so that the volume of the entire drum set sound can be controlled with a single fader or a pair of faders, rather than the audio engineer having to adjust all of the different drums and cymbals' mic volumes. A bus can often be processed just like an individual input channel, allowing the engineer to process <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> signals at once. Once again using the drum kit example, the use of bus-processing can enable the sound engineer to run all of the drum kit through an audio compressor effect to reduce unwanted signal peaks, rather than having to route all of the 10 or more mic signals on the drum kit individually.|$|E

5|$|Turmoil in the mayor's office also {{weakened}} the Birmingham city government in {{its opposition to}} the campaign.

The Citizens for Progress was backed by the Chamber of Commerce and other white professionals in the city, and their tactics were successful. In November 1962, Connor lost the race for mayor to Albert Boutwell, a less combative segregationist. However, Connor and his colleagues on the City Commission refused to accept the new mayor's authority. They claimed on a technicality that their terms would not expire until 1965 instead of in the spring of 1963. So for a brief time, Birmingham had two city governments attempting to conduct business.|$|R

It was one of those regular poets with a solemn jackass face, and lank parted hair and eyes like puddles of molasses. I don't know how he came there--up from the city, probably--but there he was on the Pepperleighs' verandah that August evening. He was reciting poetry--either Tennyson's or Shelley's, or his own, you couldn't tell--and about him sat Zena with her hands clasped and Nora Gallagher looking at the sky and Jocelyn Drone gazing into infinity, and a little tubby woman looking at the poet with her head falling over sideways--in fact, there was <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> them.|$|E
60|$|This {{aspect of}} Helvétius's doctrine, however, {{is one of}} those truths which is only valid when taken in {{connection}} with <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> different truths, and it was exactly that way of asserting a position, in itself neither indefensible nor unmeaning, which left the position open to irresistible attack. Helvétius's errors had various roots, and may be set forth in as many ways. The most general account of it is that even if he had insisted on making Self-love the strongest ingredient in our judgment of conduct, he ought at least to have given some place to Sympathy. For, though it is possible to contend that sympathy is only an indirect kind of self-love, or a shadow cast by self-love, still it is self-love so transformed as to imply a wholly different set of convictions, and to require a different name.|$|E
60|$|We {{may often}} falsely {{attribute}} to correlated variation structures which {{are common to}} whole groups of species, and which in truth are simply due to inheritance; for an ancient progenitor may have acquired through natural selection some one modification in structure, and, after thousands of generations, some other and independent modification; and these two modifications, having been transmitted to <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> descendants with diverse habits, would naturally be thought to be in some necessary manner correlated. Some other correlations are apparently due to {{the manner in which}} natural selection can alone act. For instance, Alph. De Candolle has remarked that winged seeds are never found in fruits which do not open; I should explain this rule by the impossibility of seeds gradually becoming winged through natural selection, unless the capsules were open; for in this case alone could the seeds, which were a little better adapted to be wafted by the wind, gain an advantage over others less well fitted for wide dispersal.|$|E
