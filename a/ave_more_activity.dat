40|$|International audienceThe air {{transport}} sector {{is about to}} enter the European Trading Scheme progressively in 2011. The regulation of the CO 2 emissions means for airlines more costs and a modification of the organization of their market. Our paper proposes a precise model of nonetheless the regulation but also of airlines CO 2 emissions. Our conclusions are twofold. Firstly, although profits are negatively impacted by the introduction of the ETS, a monopoly airline carries more passengers at a lower price. Two opposite effects are at play: the marginal cost increases as polluting becomes costly, which results in an increase of the price. However, there is a second effect that makes the price decreasing: the way the free allowances are given creates a bias towards <b>more</b> <b>activity.</b> We show that <b>more</b> <b>activity</b> is reached at the equilibrium. De facto, more CO 2 is emitted. Nevertheless, we show as well that it is profitable for the airline to buy a new aircraft because the marginal cost decreased. Again <b>more</b> <b>activity</b> is reached at equilibrium but at the cost of less CO 2 emissions...|$|R
