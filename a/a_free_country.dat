5|$|The {{right to}} vote in Singapore is not {{explicitly}} stated in Singapore's Constitution, but the Government has expressed the view {{that it may be}} inferred from the fact that Singapore is a representative democracy and from specific constitutional provisions, including Articles 65 and 66 which set out requirements for the prorogation and dissolution of Parliament and the holding of general elections. Speaking on the matter in Parliament in 2009, the Minister for Law, K. Shanmugam, said that the {{right to vote}} could not be a mere privilege as this would imply the existence of an institution superior to the body of citizens that is empowered to grant such a privilege, but that no such institution exists in <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>country.</b> In 1966 a Constitutional Commission chaired by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin advocated entrenching the right to vote within the Constitution, but this was not taken up by the Parliament of the day. When this proposal was repeated during the 2009 parliamentary debate, the Government took the view that such entrenchment was unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|During the mid-1930s, Nehru {{was much}} {{concerned}} with developments in Europe, {{which seemed to}} be drifting toward another world war. He was in Europe in early 1936, visiting his ailing wife, shortly before she died in a sanitarium in Switzerland. Even at this time, he emphasised that, in the event of war, India's place was alongside the democracies, though he insisted that India could only fight in support of Great Britain and France as <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E
25|$|His sister Elena Krylenko {{worked for}} Maxim Litvinov in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (although {{she was never}} {{a member of the}} Party); in 1924 she decided to leave Russia with the American writer Max Eastman (who had been in Russia for almost two years, researching and writing a life of Trotsky). To enable her to leave, Litvinov agreed to pass her off as a member of his {{delegation}} when he travelled to London for an international conference. But she could not leave the delegation and remain in <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>country</b> without a passport, which the Bolsheviks would not give her. So, in the hours before their train left, she and Max Eastman got married. They were still married and living in America when she died in 1956. Thus she escaped the purges.|$|E

50|$|India was {{the subject}} of various foreign {{influences}} and powers such as the Portuguese, the French, and most notably the British (339 years). Finally, India won its independence from Britain in 1947 AD and became <b>a</b> democratic <b>free</b> <b>country.</b>|$|R
500|$|For example, in his {{overridden}} veto of the McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950, President Truman wrote, [...] "In <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>country,</b> we punish men for {{the crimes}} they commit, but never for the opinions they have." [...] Truman also unsuccessfully vetoed the Taft–Hartley Act, which among other provisions denied trade unions National Labor Relations Board protection unless union leaders signed affidavits swearing they were not and had never been Communists. In 1953, after he left office, Truman criticized the current Eisenhower administration: ...|$|E

Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory if {{the right to vote}} is undermined." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 1890 Williams {{became a}} {{founding}} member of the Trinidad Elementary Teachers Union. The feature address was given by Chief Justice Sir John Gorrie, was in favour of reform in government and was constantly at odds with the white ruling class. He frequently gave judgments against the establishment and was so beloved by the man in the street that he was known as [...] "Papa Gorrie". Williams exhorted the teachers to act as professionals. This is <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>country,</b> he reminded them, even if it is a Crown Colony. Gorrie undoubtedly would have influenced his thinking.|$|E

Those Americans who do not wish to {{interact}} with a country whose model of governance they oppose are free to boycott. The point being – it is Americans who live in <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>country,</b> and as free people we should choose who to buy from or where to travel, not our government... Considering the lack of success government has had in engendering friendship with Cuba, it is time for government {{to get out of the}} way and let the people reach out." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{death of}} the Cardinal of Bourbon {{prompted}} measures to elect a new anti-king. Although the French monarchy was hereditary, the League's lawyers searched {{the early history of}} France for precedents to legitimise the election of a king. The Protestant scholar and ideologue François Hotman had argued in his Francogallia that France was once <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>country,</b> whose liberties had been eroded over time, including the right to elect kings. Hotman had asserted the right of the Estates-General to perform this function. Though Hotman was a Protestant, his argument also influenced Catholic jurists searching for a means to replace the Cardinal of Bourbon {{at the beginning of the}} 1590s and the decision to summon the Estates-General to elect a new [...] "king".|$|E
2500|$|In January 2012, a Starbucks {{executive}} {{stated that}} the company supports the legalization of same-sex marriage. This resulted in a boycott by the National Organization for Marriage, a political organization that opposes same-sex marriage, who received 22,000 signatures in favor of their boycott. In response, CEO Howard Schultz had this to say: [...] "If you feel, respectfully, {{that you can get}} a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it's <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>country.</b> You can sell your shares of Starbucks and buy shares in another company. Thank you very much." [...] In addition, 640,000 people also signed a petition thanking Starbucks for its support.

50|$|The {{magnitude}} of drug menace not only undermines global public health, socio-economic synopsis and international stability, {{it has also}} become an issue of National Security for Pakistan.

2500|$|On July 16, 1789, {{two days}} after the Storming of the Bastille, [...] John Frederick Sackville, serving as {{ambassador}} to France, [...] reported to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs [...] Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds, [...] "Thus, my Lord, the greatest revolution that we know anything of has been effected with, comparatively speaking—if the magnitude of the event is considered—the loss of very few lives. From this moment we may consider France as <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>country,</b> the King a very limited monarch, and the nobility as reduced to a level {{with the rest of the}} nation." [...] Yet Britain saw minority support while the majority, and especially the elite, strongly opposed the French Revolution. Britain led and funded the series of coalitions that fought France from 1793 to 1815, and then restored the Bourbons. Edmund Burke was the chief spokesman for the opposition.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea for}} the May 20 protest {{received}} support from Kathleen Parker, an opinion columnist for The Washington Post: [...] "Americans love their free speech and have had enough of those who think they can dictate the limits of that fundamental right. [...] Draw to any heart's discontent. It's <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>country.</b> For now." [...] The idea also received support from prominent bloggers and bloggers on prominent websites, such as Michael C. Moynihan at Reason magazine's [...] "Hit & Run" [...] blog, who encouraged his readers to send him their drawings. Moynihan stated he planned to select some of his favorite depictions of Muhammad from the protest movement, and then add them to the Reason.com website. Moynihan commented, [...] "In the South Park episode that started all this, Buddha does lines of coke {{and there was an}} episode where Cartman started a Christian rock band that sang very homo-erotic songs. Yet there is one religious figure we can't make fun of. The point of the episode that started the controversy is that celebrities wanted Muhammad's power not to be ridiculed. How come non-Muslims aren't allowed to make jokes?" [...] Moynihan posited that the decision of Comedy Central to enact self-censorship of the South Park episode would have the impact of worsening the situation.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{enactment}} of the Racial Discrimination Act by the Whitlam government, Sikh migration to Australia dramatically increased. While most Sikh immigrants can trace their heritage to Punjab, many come from countries other than India including Malaysia, Singapore, Fiji, Kenya, Uganda and the United Kingdom. Sikhs migrate to Australia because it is <b>a</b> <b>free</b> stable <b>country</b> with economic opportunities. In many cases Sikhs suffered injustices in their home country, {{and in the case of}} Uganda, open persecution.|$|R
40|$|This book {{looks back}} at the {{struggle}} to rid the UK of poverty and asks if the struggle is worth it. What would <b>a</b> poverty <b>free</b> <b>country</b> be like if we could overcome the obstacles which impede progress? Julia Unwin asserts that attempts to end poverty have floundered partly because they are not supported by the public. At the core of the fight against poverty therefore is a need to change public perceptions, misconceptions and prejudices and to better identify, understand and challenge the deep-rooted emotional responses that cause them.
