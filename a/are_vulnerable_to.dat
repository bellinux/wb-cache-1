5|$|Since {{workers are}} {{required}} {{to live with their}} employers, they <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> working long hours; according to Amnesty International and welfare groups, some workers routinely work 16 to 18 hours a day and have no escape from abuse.|$|E
5|$|All {{enemies are}} {{protected}} by health, shields, armor, barriers, or a combination thereof. Each type of protection has its own vulnerabilities. For example, armor is usually vulnerable to powers such as Incinerate, which burns enemies over time, and to weapons with a low rate of fire such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols. In contrast, shields <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> powers such as Overload and to rapid-firing weapons like submachine guns and assault rifles. Barriers are typically used by boss-type enemies and <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> certain weapons and powers. When the shields, armor, or barriers of an enemy have all been depleted, the player can use status-effect powers such as Pull, which temporarily levitates targets into the air, incapacitating them. Other powers may temporary benefit the player; for instance, Adrenaline Rush puts the player in bullet time. Powers do not require any sort of expendable resource; they only have a global refresh time period.|$|E
5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} very small scale. Brachiopods seldom settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, probably because they <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> pollution. This may make the population of Coptothyrus adamsi useful {{as a measure of}} environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia on the shore of the Sea of Japan.|$|E

5|$|Apart from habitat {{destruction}} and deliberate, targeted persecution, pelicans <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> disturbance at their breeding colonies by birdwatchers, photographers and other curious visitors. Human presence alone {{can cause the}} birds to accidentally displace or destroy their eggs, leave hatchlings exposed to predators and adverse weather, or even abandon their colonies completely.|$|E
5|$|As {{frigatebirds}} rely {{on large}} marine predators such as tuna for their prey, overfishing threatens to significantly impact on food availability and jeopardise whole populations. As frigatebirds nest in large dense colonies in small areas, they <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> local disasters that could {{wipe out the}} rare species or significantly impact the widespread ones.|$|E
5|$|Other {{animals in}} the state include {{reptiles}} such as lizards, cobras, kraits, and gharials. Among {{the wide variety of}} fishes, the most common ones are mahaseer and trout. Some animal species in Uttar Pradesh have gone extinct in recent years, while others, like the lion from the Gangetic Plain and the rhinoceros from the Terai region, have become endangered. Many species <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> poaching despite regulation by the government.|$|E

5|$|The {{eggs and}} chicks of this ground-nesting bird <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> {{predation}} by red foxes, pine martens, European hedgehogs, least weasels and domestic dogs, and by birds including crows, Eurasian magpies, Eurasian jays and owls. Snakes, such as common adders, may also rob the nest. Adults may be caught by {{birds of prey}} including northern goshawks, hen harriers, Eurasian sparrowhawks, common buzzards, peregrine and sooty falcons.|$|E
5|$|The three extant manatee species (family Trichechidae) and the Dugong (family Dugongidae) {{are rated}} as {{vulnerable}} on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. All four <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> extinction from habitat loss and other negative impacts related to human {{population growth and}} coastal development. Steller's sea cow, extinct since 1786, was hunted to extinction by humans.|$|E
5|$|While nesting, Arctic terns <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> {{predation}} by {{cats and}} other animals. Besides being a competitor for nesting sites, the larger herring gull steals eggs and hatchlings. Camouflaged eggs help prevent this, as do isolated nesting sites. While feeding, skuas, gulls, and other tern species will often harass {{the birds and}} steal their food. They often form mixed colonies with other terns, such as common and Sandwich terns.|$|E

5|$|While whaling {{no longer}} threatens the species, {{individuals}} <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> collisions with ships, entanglement in fishing gear and noise pollution. Like other cetaceans, humpbacks can be injured by excessive noise. In the 19th century, two humpback whales were found dead near sites of repeated oceanic sub-bottom blasting, with traumatic injuries and fractures in the ears.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds {{are common}} {{components}} of the avifauna of {{some parts of the}} Neotropics and are thought to be important in some ecological processes. They are preyed upon by birds of prey, and their tendency to join flocks is thought to provide protection against such predation. The greater round-eared bat preys on some antbird species, such as the white-bibbed antbird and the scaled antbird; the latter is the bat's preferred prey. Nests, including incubating adults, chicks and eggs, <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> predators, particularly snakes but also nocturnal mammals. Nesting success is low for many species, particularly in areas of fragmented habitat.|$|E
5|$|As of 2013, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes 15 mysticete species. One species—the North Atlantic right whale—is Endangered {{with only}} around 400(±50) {{individuals}} left, and four more are also classified as Endangered (North Pacific right whale, the blue whale, the fin whale, and the Sei whale), and another 5 ranked as Data deficient (Bryde's whale, Eden's whale, Omura's whale, Southern minke whale, and pygmy right whale). Species {{that live in}} polar habitats <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> the effects of ongoing climate change, particularly declines in sea ice, as well as ocean acidification.|$|E
30|$|Personal {{information}} such as country of birth and place of birth can <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> informed guessing. The use of questions {{in the public domain}} can <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> guessing. It may not be true for all, but traditionally people use a common family and surname. Jobling [31] indicates that from five thousand years ago, fathers have passed their surname to children. The analysis of answers to profile question “Father’s surname” in the learning phase revealed that, 64 % of participants had a common surname as their fathers’ and can <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> guessing attack.|$|R

5|$|Because of {{its great}} depth, {{for a long}} time Davidson Seamount had been preceded only by a sparse few investigations. Davidson is {{interesting}} to volcanologists because of its unique geology, and to biologists for its unique ecology. In 2002 the NOAA sponsored the first modern in-depth study of the seamount. The team included scientists, educators, and resource managers, with the goal of documenting species, taking geologic samples, and describing the ocean environment. The expedition documented many rare, previously undiscovered species that exist nowhere else, not even on nearby seamounts, including ancient coral gardens that <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> human activity.|$|E
5|$|Both {{intensive}} and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns. In intensive systems, cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking can be common, with some farmers using beak trimming as a preventative measure. Diseases {{can also be}} common and spread rapidly through the flock. In extensive systems, the birds are exposed to adverse weather conditions and <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> predators and disease-carrying wild birds. Barn systems {{have been found to}} have the worst bird welfare. In Southeast Asia, a lack of disease control in free-range farming has been associated with outbreaks of avian influenza.|$|E
5|$|Jellyfish stings killed about 1,500 {{people in}} the 20th century, and cubozoans are {{particularly}} dangerous. On the other hand, some large jellyfish are considered a delicacy in East and Southeast Asia. Coral reefs have long been economically important as providers of fishing grounds, protectors of shore buildings against currents and tides, and more recently as centers of tourism. However, they <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> over-fishing, mining for construction materials, pollution, and damage caused by tourism.|$|E

5|$|Not all {{software}} states <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> rowhammer attacks. An attacker thus {{needs to}} find right target states in order to utilize rowhammer errors. In practice, {{one of the main}} challenges is in identifying target states. Such typically have been done by domain experts. The mainstream fault tolerance community responded to rowhammer attacks with a systematic methodology which can be used to identify, validate, and evaluate rowhammer attack target states and their exploitability. That work is based on the well-established fault injection-based experimental methodology, and generalized attack target states and found a few practical target states that were previously unknown.|$|E
5|$|Once fusion begins, the {{temperature}} of the white dwarf increases. A main sequence star supported by thermal pressure can expand and cool which automatically regulates the increase in thermal energy. However, degeneracy pressure is independent of temperature; white dwarfs are unable to regulate temperature in the manner of normal stars, so they <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> runaway fusion reactions. The flare accelerates dramatically, in part due to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability and interactions with turbulence. It is still a matter of considerable debate whether this flare transforms into a supersonic detonation from a subsonic deflagration.|$|E
5|$|Pintail nests and chicks <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> {{predation}} by mammals, such as foxes and badgers, {{and birds}} like gulls, crows and magpies. The adults can take flight to escape terrestrial predators, but nesting females in particular {{may be surprised}} by large carnivores such as bobcats. Large birds of prey, such as northern goshawks, will take ducks from the ground, and some falcons, including the gyrfalcon, have the speed and power to catch flying birds.|$|E
