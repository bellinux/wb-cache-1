25|$|Galileo {{showed a}} remarkably modern {{appreciation}} for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. He understood the parabola, {{both in terms of}} conic sections {{and in terms of the}} ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x). Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of friction and other disturbances.

25|$|Note that non-elliptic trajectories also exist, {{but are not}} closed, and {{are thus}} not orbits. If the {{eccentricity}} is greater than one, the trajectory is a hyperbola. If the eccentricity is equal to one and the angular momentum is zero, the trajectory is radial. If the eccentricity is one and there is angular momentum, the trajectory is <b>a</b> <b>parabola.</b>|$|E

The involute from the vertex, that is the roulette formed traced by a point starting at the vertex when a line is rolled on a catenary, is the tractrix.|$|E
25|$|Problems of {{quadrature}} for curvilinear {{figures are}} much more difficult. The quadrature of the circle with compass and straightedge had been proved in the 19th century to be impossible. Nevertheless, for some figures (for example the Lune of Hippocrates) a quadrature can be performed. The quadratures of a sphere surface and <b>a</b> <b>parabola</b> segment done by Archimedes became the highest achievement of the antique analysis.|$|E

This is the basis for the use of this kind of reflector for solar cooking.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} said that Galileo thought the curve of a hanging chain was parabolic. In his Two New Sciences (1638), Galileo says that a hanging cord is an {{approximate}} parabola, and he correctly observes that this approximation improves as the curvature gets smaller and is almost exact when the elevation is less than 45°. That the curve followed by a chain is not <b>a</b> <b>parabola</b> was proven by Joachim Jungius (1587–1657); this result was published posthumously in 1669.|$|E
25|$|We are {{informed}} by Eutocius that the method {{he used to}} solve the cubic equation was due to Dionysodorus (250BCE– 190BCE). Dionysodorus solved the cubic {{by means of the}} intersection of a rectangular hyperbola and <b>a</b> <b>parabola.</b> This was related to a problem in Archimedes' On the Sphere and Cylinder. Conic sections would be studied and used for thousands of years by Greek, and later Islamic and European, mathematicians. In particular Apollonius of Perga's famous Conics deals with conic sections, among other topics.|$|E

25|$|In Hellenistic Egypt, the {{mathematician}} Euclid {{laid down}} the foundations of mathematical rigor and introduced the concepts of definition, axiom, theorem and proof still in use today in his Elements, considered the most influential textbook ever written.

25|$|The optics to {{distribute}} {{the light in the}} desired pattern are designed into the reflector itself, rather than into the lens. Depending on the development tools and techniques in use, the reflector may be engineered from the start as a bespoke shape, or it may start as <b>a</b> <b>parabola</b> standing in for {{the size and shape of}} the completed package. In the latter case, the entire surface area is modified so as to produce individual segments of specifically calculated, complex contours. The shape of each segment is designed such that their cumulative effect produces the required light distribution pattern.|$|E
25|$|Assuming a {{negligible}} weight {{as compared to}} the weight of the deck and vehicles being supported, the main cables of a suspension bridge will form <b>a</b> <b>parabola</b> (very similar to a catenary, the form the unloaded cables take before the deck is added). One can see the shape from the constant increase of the gradient of the cable with linear (deck) distance, this increase in gradient at each connection with the deck providing a net upward support force. Combined with the relatively simple constraints placed upon the actual deck, this makes the suspension bridge much simpler to design and analyze than a cable-stayed bridge, where the deck is in compression.|$|E

25|$|A {{parabolic}} antenna is an antenna {{that uses a}} parabolic reflector, a curved surface with the cross-sectional shape of <b>a</b> <b>parabola,</b> to direct the radio waves. The most common form is shaped like a dish and is popularly called a dish antenna or parabolic dish. The main advantage of a {{parabolic antenna}} {{is that it has}} high directivity. It functions similarly to a searchlight or flashlight reflector to direct the radio waves in a narrow beam, or receive radio waves from one particular direction only. Parabolic antennas have some of the highest gains, meaning that they can produce the narrowest beamwidths, of any antenna type. In order to achieve narrow beamwidths, the parabolic reflector must be much larger than the wavelength of the radio waves used, so parabolic antennas are used in the high frequency part of the radio spectrum, at UHF and microwave (SHF) frequencies, at which the wavelengths are small enough that conveniently-sized reflectors can be used.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the roots}} of {{algebraic}} geometry {{date back to the}} work of the Hellenistic Greeks from the 5th century BC. The Delian problem, for instance, was to construct a length x so that the cube of side x contained the same volume as the rectangular box a2b for given sides a and b. Menaechmus (circa 350 BC) considered the problem geometrically by intersecting the pair of plane conics aynbsp&=nbsp&x2 and xynbsp&=nbsp&ab. The later work, in the 3rd century BC, of Archimedes and Apollonius studied more systematically problems on conic sections, and also involved the use of coordinates. The Arab mathematicians were able to solve by purely algebraic means certain cubic equations, and then to interpret the results geometrically. This was done, for instance, by Ibn al-Haytham in the 10th century AD. Subsequently, Persian mathematician Omar Khayyám (born 1048 A.D.) discovered a method for solving cubic equations by intersecting <b>a</b> <b>parabola</b> with a circle.|$|E
25|$|Archimedes (c.287–212 BC) of Syracuse, widely {{considered}} the greatest mathematician of antiquity, used {{the method of}} exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of <b>a</b> <b>parabola</b> with the summation of an infinite series, in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus. He also showed one could use the method of exhaustion to calculate the value of π with as much precision as desired, and obtained the most accurate value of π then known, 3<nbsp&πnbsp&<nbsp&3. He also studied the spiral bearing his name, obtained formulas for the volumes of surfaces of revolution (paraboloid, ellipsoid, hyperboloid), and an ingenious method of exponentiation for expressing very large numbers. While he is also known for his contributions to physics and several advanced mechanical devices, Archimedes himself placed far greater value on the products of his thought and general mathematical principles. He regarded as his greatest achievement his finding of the surface area and volume of a sphere, which he obtained by proving these are 2/3 the surface area and volume of a cylinder circumscribing the sphere.|$|E
