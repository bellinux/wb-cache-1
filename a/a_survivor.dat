Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma, which is a very aggressive brain tumor. Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months. McCain is <b>a</b> <b>survivor</b> of previous cancers, including melanoma.|$|E
5|$|Robie Mortin {{came forward}} as <b>a</b> <b>survivor</b> during this time; {{she was the}} only one added to the list who could prove she lived in Rosewood in 1923, totaling nine {{survivors}} who were compensated. Gaining compensation changed some families, whose members began to fight among themselves. Some descendants refused it, while others went into hiding to avoid the press of friends and relatives who came asking for handouts. Some descendants, after dividing the funds among siblings, received not much more than $100 each. Later, the Florida Department of Education set up the Rosewood Family Scholarship Fund for Rosewood descendants and ethnic minorities.|$|E
