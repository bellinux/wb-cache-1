He <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the remains and {{was taken to the}} place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse's skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus {{fulfilling}} the prophecy.|$|E
5|$|Alex visits Meredith {{during her}} {{recovery}} {{and attempts to}} cheer her up. Alex realizes Meredith’s hearing has returned after she laughs {{at one of his}} jokes. Later Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) informs Meredith that Lou underwent surgery and was discharged. He's <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her to apologize, but Meredith refuses. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) helps her prepare for a visit with her children. On arriving they are terrified when they see their mother in that condition and leave. Meredith has a panic attack, and Penny steps up to help, removing the wires holding her jaw shut. Jackson reprimands Penny for jeopardising the healing process.|$|E
5|$|Despite these setbacks, Sharp's efforts {{did have}} some success. In April 1783, he sent {{an account of the}} {{massacre}} to William Dillwyn, a Quaker, who had <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> evidence that was critical of the slave trade. The London Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends decided shortly after to begin campaigning against slavery, and a petition signed by 273Quakers was submitted to parliament in July 1783. Sharp also sent letters to Anglican bishops and clergy and to those already sympathetic to the abolitionist cause.|$|E

5|$|Lynch {{also met}} Stuart Cornfeld during this time. Cornfeld had enjoyed Eraserhead and was {{interested}} in producing Ronnie Rocket; Cornfeld was working for Mel Brooks and Brooksfilms at the time, and when the two realized that Ronnie Rocket was unlikely to find sufficient financing to be produced, Lynch <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> some already-written scripts to work from for his next film instead. Cornfeld found four scripts he felt Lynch would be interested in, but on hearing {{the name of the}} first, the director decided his next project would be The Elephant Man.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} the gallows, Beauchamp <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Patrick Darby, who {{was among}} the {{assembled}} spectators. Beauchamp smiled and offered his hand, but Darby declined the gesture. Beauchamp publicly denied that Darby had any involvement with the murder, but accused Darby of having lied about the 1824 meeting. Darby denied this accusation of perjury and tried to engage Beauchamp in a discussion about it, hoping he would retract the charge, but the prisoner ordered the cart driver to continue to the gallows.|$|E
5|$|When Sarria {{was around}} ten years old, {{he asked his}} mother {{how much money they}} had in the bank. Maria, who gave her money to her {{employer}} Mr. Jost to invest, <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the books. She discovered that Jost had been embezzling from her and from the other women whom she had referred to him. Jost was arrested, convicted and deported. Maria sued Jost's corporate partners and received a settlement but never recovered the bulk of the money. Unable to afford her house payments, Maria moved José and the Millen family to Redwood City in 1932.|$|E

5|$|Berkman {{was ready}} {{to carry out the}} {{assassination}} on July21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in his pockets he had a gun and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is to Be Done? On July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and took aim at Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his growing}} talent, Prokofiev's parents hesitated over {{starting}} their son on a musical career {{at such an}} early age, and considered the possibility of his attending a good high school in Moscow. By 1904, his mother had decided instead on Saint Petersburg, and she and Prokofiev visited the then capital to explore the possibility of moving there for his education. They were introduced to composer Alexander Glazunov, {{a professor at the}} Saint Petersburg Conservatory, who <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Prokofiev and his music; Prokofiev had composed two more operas, Desert Islands and The Feast during the Plague, and was working on his fourth, Undina. Glazunov was so impressed that he urged Prokofiev's mother to have her son apply for admission to the Conservatory. He passed the introductory tests and enrolled that year.|$|E
5|$|P. S. Raman, {{who went}} to Chennai in 1963 to join a medical college, was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Sridhar, who was auditioning {{newcomers}} for the film. Raman was renamed Ravichandran and introduced in this film, as the character Ashok. Sivakumar had auditioned for the role before it went to Ravichandran. During a flight, Sridhar met an air-hostess named Vasundhara Devi and approached her to play one of the female leads. Because she shared her name with Vasundhara Devi, the mother of actress Vyjayanthimala, Sridhar renamed her Kanchana to avoid confusion. Telugu actor Krishna has stated that he was offered {{a role in the}} film by Sridhar, but he could not accept it due to his lack of knowledge in Tamil.|$|E

50|$|Peggys answers do {{not reveal}} the {{original}} Hamiltonian cycle in G. Each round, Victor will learn only Hs isomorphism to G or a Hamiltonian cycle in H. He would need both answers for a single H to discover the cycle in G, so the information remains unknown as long as Peggy can generate a distinct H every round. If Peggy does not know of a Hamiltonian Cycle in G, but somehow knew in advance what Victor would <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> each round then she could cheat. For example, if Peggy knew ahead of time that Victor would <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Hamiltonian Cycle in H then she could generate a Hamiltonian cycle for an unrelated graph. Similarly, if Peggy knew in advance that Victor would <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the isomorphism then she could simply generate an isomorphic graph H (in which she also does not know a Hamiltonian Cycle). Victor could simulate the protocol by himself (without Peggy) because {{he knows what he}} will <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Therefore, Victor gains no information about the Hamiltonian cycle in G from the information revealed in each round.|$|R
5|$|On 19November 1932, Lerew enlisted as an air cadet in the RAAF active reserve, {{known as}} the Citizen Air Force (CAF). He had marched into Victoria Barracks on a whim and <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the person in charge of Air Force recruiting. He was shown {{to the office of}} Squadron Leader Raymond Brownell, also a former Scotch College boy, who {{admitted}} him. Lerew undertook flying instruction on the 1933 'B'course conducted by No.1 Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton, and was commissioned a pilot officer on 1April. He transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force on 20May 1935, following graduation from university, and was promoted flying officer on 1July. Posted to No.1 Aircraft Depot, he was raised to probationary flight lieutenant in 1936. The rank became substantive the following year, when he was appointed Staff Officer Directorate of Works and Buildings at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, responsible for selection and improvement of airfield sites.|$|E
5|$|One bank {{employee}} {{testified that}} Shakur {{was one of}} the bank robbers, but three other bank employees (including two tellers) testified that they were uncertain. The prosecution showed surveillance photos of four of the six alleged robbers, contending that one of them was Shakur wearing a wig. Shakur was forcibly subdued and photographed by the FBI on the judge's order, after having refused to cooperate, believing that the FBI would use photo manipulation; a subsequent judge determined that the manners in which the photos were obtained violated Shakur's rights and ruled the new photos inadmissible. In her autobiography, Shakur recounts being beaten, choked, and kicked on the courtroom floor by five marshals, as Williams narrated the events to ensure they would appear on the court record. Shortly after deliberation began, the jury <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> all the photographic exhibits taken from the surveillance footage. The jury determined that a widely circulated FBI photo allegedly showing Shakur participating in the robbery was not her.|$|E
25|$|Powell <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> General Hartranft, and {{impressed}} {{upon him}} once more Mary Surratt's innocence. Hartranft wrote a memorandum to President Johnson outlining Powell's statement, {{adding that he}} believed Powell to be telling the truth. Powell then made a statement exonerating Atzerodt, declaring that Atzerodt refused to kill Vice President Johnson even though Booth had ordered him to do so.|$|E

25|$|Nine days later, on October 12, {{gang members}} {{converged on the}} jail where Dillinger was being held. Pierpont, Makley, and Russell Clark entered the facility, while Ed Shouse {{remained}} outside as a lookout. The three men confronted Sheriff Jesse Sarber—in the presence of Deputy Wilbur Sharp and Sarber's wife—and stated that they were from Indiana State Prison with a transfer request for John Dillinger. When the sheriff <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> their credentials, Pierpont {{shot him in the}} abdomen. Makley and one other man then physically assaulted the sheriff, mortally injuring him.

Since then, he gave his room in the campus away and settled with Mathilde.|$|E

25|$|When Mar Ukba {{was about}} to die, he <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his charity accounts. Finding gifts worth 7,000 Sijan gold denarii {{recorded}} therein, he exclaimed that the provisions were scanty and the road was long, and he forthwith distributed half of his wealth to charity. The Gemara asked how Mar Ukba could have given away so much, when Rabbi Elai taught that when the Sanhedrin sat at Usha, it ordained that if a person wishes to give liberally the person should not give more than {{a fifth of the}} person's wealth. The Gemara explained that this limitation applies only during a person's lifetime, as the person might thereby be impoverished, but the limitation does not apply to gifts at death.|$|E
25|$|Queen Elizabeth II visited Villa Guardamangia {{during her}} state visit to Malta in 1992 {{and she and}} the Duke of Edinburgh celebrated their 60th anniversary there.

The Queen did not visit the villa {{while she was in}} Malta for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2015, as it was in a poor state of repair and subject of a dispute between its owners and the government, but President Marie Louise Coleiro Preca presented the Queen with another painting of the villa's façade.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{a column}} in The Guardian {{suggested}} that Horrobin had also actively suppressed research findings contradicting his claims about EPO. Horrobin wrote a meta-analysis of EPO research on eczema in 1989, concluding that EPO was effective. Horrobin excluded the negative results of the largest published study to date but included purported results of seven of his own unpublished studies that remained unpublished as of 2006. When several scientists <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the unpublished data, Horrobin's legal team convinced the journal to refuse the request. In 1997, Horrobin's team successfully halted the publication of another meta-analysis commissioned by the Department of Health. Research published after Horrobin's death indicates that fatty acids are no more effective than a placebo against eczema; Scotia's medicines licences for evening primrose oil drugs was withdrawn.|$|E
