Additionally, the PTS would perform tests that simulated airborne missile operation, programmed {{the trajectory of}} the missile and controlled <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> sequence. Plug-in micromodules increased maintainability and allowed the PTS operator to perform 80% of all repairs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> position. A turbine driven Power Station, mounted behind the PTS, provided the primary electrical and pneumatic power and conditioned air for the missile and ground support equipment <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> position.|$|R

25|$|For {{stubborn}} {{oil well}} fires, {{the use of}} a gas turbine to blast a large volume of water at high velocity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> proved popular with firefighters in Kuwait and was brought to the region by Hungarians equipped with MiG-21 engines mounted originally on a T-34 (later replaced with T-55) tank, called Big wind. It extinguished 9 fires in 43 days.|$|E
25|$|To {{protect the}} {{municipality}} from fire hazards, {{there are nine}} firemen assigned <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> Station in Quezon. The current ratio of firemen to population ratio is 1:2407. For the past eight years, there have been 10 fire incidents recorded in the municipality. The types of incidence according to origin were mostly due to negligence. The total fire fighting force also extends assistance and responds immediately to other units in the province upon request during emergencies.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, to commemorate <b>the</b> Great <b>Fires</b> of 1947, <b>the</b> State of Maine {{developed}} signs for each community where <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> burned, detailing <b>the</b> effect <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> had on those communities. Signs still stand today in many communities, including Alfred <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Alfred <b>Fire</b> Department on Kennebunk road, Shapleigh <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Ross Corner <b>Fire</b> Department on Ross Corner Road, and North Kennebunkport (Arundel) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Central <b>Fire</b> Station and Town Hall on Limerick Road.|$|R
25|$|While many {{of those}} present <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> have avoided circuses ever since, others have returned. In May 2004, Dorothy Carvey and her son, Tighe, were given free passes for their family by Ringling Bros. to attend a show at the XL Center. For Dorothy Carvey, this was her first time {{attending}} a circus since the fire occurred. The Hartford Courant published {{the story of their}} visit, as well as what happened to them in 1944.|$|E
25|$|In popular {{literature}} {{firefighters are}} sometimes depicted with Dalmatian dogs. This breed originated in southern Europe and was {{primarily responsible for}} herding livestock and running alongside carriages drawn by horses. In the days of horse-drawn fire vehicles, the horses were usually released on arrival <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> and the Dalmatians would lead the horses through traffic and to {{a safe place to}} wait until the fire was out. Dalmatians also filled the role of protecting the horses' feet from other dogs as equipment was being transported to the fire scene.|$|E
25|$|In some areas, {{emergency}} responders {{are provided}} with specialized equipment, such as a Mobile Infrared Transmitter, which allows emergency response vehicles, particularly fire-fighting apparatus, to have high-priority travel by having the lights along their route change to green. The technology behind these methods has evolved, from panels <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> department (which could trigger and control green lights for certain major corridors) to optical systems (which the individual fire apparatus can be equipped with to communicate directly with receivers on the signal head). In other areas, public transport buses have special equipment to get green lights.|$|E

25|$|The town {{set up a}} {{volunteer}} fire department in June 1906 and ordered two fire engines {{at a cost of}} $972.18 each. In 1913 a by-law was passed to pay firemen $1.00 per hour during a fire, and $0.50 per hour during practice. With a bonus of $3.00 to the team that arrived first <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> In 1960 the first fire station was built, along with the purchase of a new pumper truck. Standby equipment was purchased in 1977. Prior to 1960 the fire teams were in charge of finding storage for the fire equipment.|$|E

While covering the flood, Bill uncovers the corruption which led to the faulty construction of the levee, resulting in the levee's failure. He also begins to win back the affection of Jane. He heads back to New York with the footage.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Engine 51 was a 1965 open-cab Crown Firecoach, and {{was represented}} by LACoFD Engine 127's 1965 Crown in stock footage <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> station (in reality LACoFD Station 127), and by LACoFD Engine 60's 1965 Crown (the unit assigned to Universal Studios) for filming {{on the grounds of}} the studio. In a few instances in the first and second seasons, the regular apparatus borrowed from LACoFD and used for filming appear to have been unavailable as some scenes show a slightly different vintage Crown Firecoach pumper, most evident by the different style of emergency lights on the cab's roof. The mixing of stock station and response footage with footage filmed for specific storylines created continuity errors by mixing these apparatus.|$|E

25|$|Shortly before 19:00 BST on Wednesday, 8 August 2006, a fire {{broke out}} at the {{derelict}} Montebello Hotel in Fore Street, Ilfracombe. Twenty fire engines were required {{to put out the}} blaze including a number rushed to the scene from Woolacombe, Barnstaple and the bordering county of Somerset. Specialist equipment was brought in from as far afield as Exeter, and according to the local radio news 85 firemen were involved <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> The fire spread to three neighbouring properties and showered debris over a wide area. The six-storey hotel was completely gutted, with only the front wall, chimney stacks and remains of the lift shaft frame surviving the blaze, and the fire was still being damped-down the following day. Fore Street was closed for some period due to the difficulties of demolition.|$|E
25|$|While the Arundel affinity's {{dominance}} {{was generally}} imposed through adept {{use of the}} law and civil authority, there was an undertow of violence and intimidation and this became increasingly open and notorious after 1410, as Arundel's affinity clashed with supporters of most of the county's other magnates. Burley was very close to the perpetrators of violence: his son, his former ward and his future executors were involved {{in some of the most}} sensational outrages. These led to complaints about the prevalence of bad governance and murder in Shropshire <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> and Faggot Parliament, held in Leicester in 1414. Many cases came to court at the last ever regional session of the Court of King's Bench, held at Shrewsbury in Trinity term of 1414. Henry V was present in person, along with William Hankford, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, to make a show of taking seriously the complaints against his most powerful supporter in the region, and much of what is known of the violence is derived from allegations made at that court.|$|E
25|$|The {{department}} had serious problems: The dispatching system {{could not identify}} {{the exact location of}} structures like the United States Capitol or the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, dispatchers sent crews to the wrong locations or in the wrong directions, firefighters didn't know how to use life-saving emergency equipment such as defibrillators, injuries to civilians during fires were on the increase, fire engines and ambulances were having more accidents while responding to calls, and ambulances took twice as long to respond to calls (11 minutes and 21 seconds) than the national average. The training structures <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> academy were in serious disrepair, trainees were found extensively cheating on tests, there were equipment and employee shortages, and equipment was old and in disrepair. Three firefighters died in 1999 in two months, creating a deep morale problem. (Prior to the incidents, just a single firefighter had died in 11 years.) Few had little experience overseeing the provision of emergency medical care, although 80 percent of calls in D.C. were of that nature. Few was also only the second fire chief hired from outside the department, and had extremely poor relations with the firefighter's union.|$|E

25|$|In April 1413 a {{group of}} Midlands gentry, led by William Lichfield, Cornwall's son-in-law, made mainprise of £100 for him at Westminster and he undertook, under a pain of £500, to do no harm to anyone. This was a prelude to a case tried at Court of King's Bench at Shrewsbury in Trinity term. Henry V was present in person, along with William Hankford, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, in {{response}} to complaints about the prevalence of bad governance and murder in Shropshire made <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> and Faggot Parliament in Leicester, earlier that year. The business was dominated by the aftermath of large-scale violence between the Arundel affinity and the followers of Lord Furnival in 1413. However, Cornwall was accused of procuring Henry Cornwall of Catsley, possibly his own illegitimate son, to commit a murder and of harbouring him after the event. Henry {{seems to have had}} a reputation for violence, as he was also accused of a serious assault on a cleric in 1412. The murder had taken place in August 1413 at Sir John Cornwall's own manorial court in Kinlet, emphasising the likelihood of his complicity.|$|E
25|$|Vernon Hunter, a 68-year-old Revenue Officer Group Manager for the IRS, {{was killed}} in the {{incident}} along with Joseph Stack. Thirteen people were reported as injured, two of them critically. Debris from the crash reportedly struck a car being driven on the southbound access road of Route 183 in front of the building, shattering the windshield. Another driver on the southbound access road of Route 183 had his windows and sunroof shattered during the impact, and had debris fall inside his car, yet escaped uninjured. Robin DeHaven, a glass worker and former combat engineer for the United States Army, saw the collision while commuting to a customer's house for his job, and used the extension ladder on his truck to rescue six people from the 2nd floor of the building. By coincidence, the Travis County Hazardous Materials Team— an inter-agency group of firefighters from outside the City of Austin— had just assembled for training across the freeway from the targeted building, observed the low and fast flight of Stack's plane, and heard the blast impact. They immediately responded, attacking the fire and initiating search-and-rescue. Several City of Austin fire engines for the area of the Echelon building were already deployed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> at Stack's home {{at the time of the}} impact.|$|E
