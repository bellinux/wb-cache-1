40|$|During {{the months}} leading up to the Rwandan {{genocide}} of 1994, cognitive biases obstructed the capacity of U.

S. government reporting on Rwanda before April 1994 utilized a faulty cognitive frame that failed to differentiate between threats of civil war and genocide. Because U. S. officials framed the crisis in Rwanda as a potential civil war, they underestimated the virulence of the threat to Tutsi civilians and discounted the risk of catastrophic violence. The “civil war frame” also justified rigid U. S. policy guidance that may have exacerbated ethnic and political conflicts in Rwanda on the eve of the genocide. The phenomenon of faulty cognitive framing remains a challenge for contemporary atrocity prevention and response efforts in countries including Libya, South Sudan, and Syria...|$|R

40|$|Electric Vehicles (EVs) {{have high}} energy {{capacity}} and their <b>anticipated</b> <b>mass</b> deployment can significantly increase the electrical demand {{on the grid}} during charging. Simulation results suggest that for every 10 % increase in households operating 3 kW EV chargers in an uncontrolled way, {{there is a potential}} increase of peak demand by up to 18 %. Given the limited spare capacity of most existing distribution networks, it is expected that large-scale charging of EVs will lead to potential problems with regard to network capacity and control. This paper presents analysis of these problems and investigates potential means by which the particular features of EV batteries may be used to enable large-scale introduction of EVs without the need for wholesale upgrading of power grids. Smart charging, using a combination of controlled EV charging (G 2 V) and Vehicle to Grid (V 2 G), can significantly help. The results presented demonstrate the benefits of smart charging for the grid and consider the impact of grid support on the EV battery lifetime. Various factors that affect capacity degradation of Lithium ion battery (used to power EVs) are analysed and the impacts of G 2 V and V 2 G operation on battery capacity loss and lifetime are evaluated. Laboratory test results are provided to quantify the effects of the various degradation factors, and it is shown how these may be ameliorated to allow economic network support using EV batteries without incurring excessive battery degradation in the process...|$|R

Car crashes, injured and dead bodies, cameras, media and night-time metropolises are points of convergence. Divergently, all three authors follow their own formal and stylistic routes. Also the emotions, as motivation and effects of actions, involved in Nightcrawler and Crash produce a different and more complex geometry – {{to use one of}} Ballard’s favourite words. In could be said that in both cases we find depiction of violence, perversity and pornography. However, the more luridly sexual and solipsistic Crash offers a higher intensity of emotion that may be an exaggerated (fractal) mirror image of Western consumerism, hedonism and voyeurism, spectacularly <b>anticipating</b> the <b>mass</b> media of today.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{effective}} mass scaling in the single particle spectra calculated within the Skyrme energy density functional (EDF) method is studied. It is demonstrated that for specific pairs of orbitals the commonly <b>anticipated</b> isoscalar effective <b>mass</b> (m*) scaling of the single-particle level splittings is almost canceled by an implicit m*-scaling due to other parameters in the Skyrme EDF. This holds in particular for an indirect m*-scaling of the two-body spin-orbit strength making the theory essentially unpredictable with respect to single particle energies. It is argued that this unphysical property of the Skyrme EDF is a mere consequence of the strategies and datasets used to fit these functionals. The inclusion of certain single-particle spin-orbit splittings to fit the two-body spin-orbit and the tensor interaction strengths reinstates the conventional m*-scaling and improves {{the performance of the}} Skyrme EDF.

40|$|The anti-neoplastic agent didemnin B {{from the}} Caribbean {{tunicate}} Trididemnum solidum {{was the first}} marine drug to be clinically tested in humans. Because of its limited supply and its complex cyclic depsipeptide structure, considerable challenges were encountered during didemnin B's development that continue to limit aplidine (dehydrodidemnin B), which is currently being evaluated in numerous clinical trials. Herein we show that the didemnins are bacterial products produced by the marine α-proteobacteria Tistrella mobilis and Tistrella bauzanensis via a unique post-assembly line maturation process. Complete genome sequence analysis of the 6, 513, 401 bp T. mobilis strain KA 081020 - 065 with its five circular replicons revealed the putative didemnin biosynthetic gene cluster (did) on the 1, 126, 962 bp megaplasmid pTM 3. The did locus encodes a 13 -module hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase enzyme complex organized in a collinear arrangement for the synthesis of the fatty acylglutamine ester derivatives didemnins X and Y rather than didemnin B as first <b>anticipated.</b> Imaging <b>mass</b> spectrometry of T. mobilis bacterial colonies captured the time-dependent extracellular conversion of the didemnin X and Y precursors to didemnin B, in support of an unusual post-synthetase activation mechanism.
