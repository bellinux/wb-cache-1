40|$|In a {{previous}} report, we presented our results of forty-two acetabular reconstructions, performed {{with use of}} impaction bone-grafting and a cemented polyethylene cup, in thirty-seven patients who were younger than fifty years and had a minimum of fifteen years of follow-up. The present update study shows the results after twenty to twenty-eight years. Eight <b>additional</b> <b>cups</b> had to be revised [...] four because of aseptic loosening, three because of wear, and one during a revision of the stem. Three <b>additional</b> <b>cups</b> were considered loose on radiographs. Survivorship of the acetabular reconstructions, with an end point of revision for any reason, was 73 % after twenty years and 52 % after twenty-five years. With revision for aseptic loosening as the end point, survival was 85 % after twenty years and 77 % after twenty-five years; for signs of loosening on radiographs, survival was 71 % at twenty years and 62 % at twenty-five years. In conclusion, our previous results have declined but the technique of using impacted morselized bone graft and a cemented cup is useful {{for the purpose of}} restoring bone stock in young patients whose acetabular defects require primary or revision total hip arthroplasty...|$|R
