50|$|The <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> is a {{contract}} - {{an agreement between}} the shipper and the carrier. The agent only acts as an intermediary between the shipper and carrier. The <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> is also {{a contract}} of good faith. This means that the shipper {{will be responsible for}} the haul also be liable for all the damage suffered by the airline or any person due to irregularity, incorrectness or incompleteness of insertions on the <b>air</b> <b>waybill,</b> even if the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> has been completed by an agent or the carrier on his behalf.|$|E
50|$|An <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> (AWB) or air {{consignment}} note is a receipt issued by an international airline for goods and an evidence of the contract of carriage, {{but it is not}} a document of title to the goods. Hence, the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> is non-negotiable.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> {{may be used}} as a bill or invoice {{together}} with supporting documents since it may indicate charges to be paid by the consignee, charges due to the agent or the carrier. An original copy of the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> is used for the carrier's accounting ...|$|E
50|$|IATA airline designators {{are used}} to {{identify}} an airline for commercial purposes in reservations, timetables, tickets, tariffs, <b>air</b> <b>waybills</b> and in telecommunications.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Air</b> <b>waybills</b> have eleven digit numbers {{which can}} be used to make bookings, check the status of delivery, and current {{position}} of the shipment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>waybills</b> {{are issued}} in 8 sets of {{different}} colours. The first three copies {{are classified as}} originals. The first original, Green in colour, is the Issuing Carrier's copy. The second, coloured Pink, is the Consignee's Copy. The third, coloured Blue, is the Shipper's copy. A fourth Brown copy acts as the Delivery Receipt, or proof of delivery. The other three copies are white.|$|R
50|$|The <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> is a contract, i.e. an {{agreement}} enforceable by law. To become a valid contract {{it has to}} be signed by the shipper or his agent and by the carrier or its authorised agent. Although the same individual or organisation may act on behalf of both the carrier and the shipper, the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> must be signed twice one each in the respective carrier and shipper boxes. Both signatures may be of the same person. This also implies that the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> should be issued immediately upon receipt of the goods and letter in instructions from the shipper.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to complete an <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> through a computerised system. Agents {{all over the world}} are now using their own in-house computer systems to issue airlines' and freight forwarders' own air waybills. IATA cargo agents usually hold air waybills of several carriers. However, it gradually became difficult to accommodate these pre-numbered air waybills with the printed identification in the computer system. Therefore a neutral <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> was created.Both types of air waybills have the same format and layout. However, the neutral <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> does not bear any pre-printed individual name, head office address, logo and serial number.|$|E
50|$|The <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} document issued by a carrier either directly or through its authorised agent. It is a non-negotiable transport document. It covers transport of cargo from airport to airport. By accepting a shipment an IATA cargo agent is acting on behalf of the carrier whose <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> is issued.|$|E
50|$|On 4 January 2011, {{the cargo}} {{division}} of the airline, Cathay Pacific Cargo, became the first airline operating out of Hong Kong to fully switch to e-air waybill. This {{eliminates the need for}} all paper documents when issuing <b>air</b> <b>waybills.</b> The International <b>Air</b> Transport Association (IATA) selected nine countries and territories and airlines in which to run the e-AWB pilot program, including Hong Kong and Cathay Pacific.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to this preparation, Leishman also prepared fake Air Canada coveralls by purchasing some winter coveralls, and stenciling the Air Canada logo onto them. Lastly, he acquired some <b>Air</b> Canada <b>waybills</b> from the <b>Air</b> Canada desk at the airport by simply waiting until the desk was unmanned at lunch, and taking what he needed.|$|R
40|$|South Africa has legally {{exported}} substantial {{quantities of}} lion bones to Southeast Asia and China since 2008, apparently {{as part of}} the multinational trade substituting bones and body parts of other large cats for those of the tiger in wine and other health tonics. The legal sale of lion bones may mask an illegal trade, the size of which is only partially known. An observed component of the illegal trade is that quantities of skeletons are sometimes declared falsely/fraudulently on CITES export permits. Furthermore, there are emerging concerns that bones from tigers reared in captivity in South Africa and elsewhere are being laundered as lion bones using CITES Appendix II permits. There is therefore a need for tools to monitor the trade in lion body parts and to distinguish between lions and tigers. Our research indicates {{that it is possible to}} use skeletons, skulls and cranial sutures to detect misdeclarations in the lion bone trade. It is also possible to use the average mass of a lion skeleton to corroborate the numbers of skeletons declared on CITES permits, relative to the weight of the consolidated consignments stated on the <b>air</b> <b>waybills.</b> When the mass of con-solidated consignments of skeletons destined for export was regressed against the numbe...|$|R
5000|$|The {{format of}} the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> has been {{designed}} by IATA and these {{can be used for}} both domestic as well as international transportation. These are available in two forms, viz. the airline logo equipped <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> and the neutral air waybill.Usually, airline air waybills are distributed to IATA cargo agents by IATA airlines.The air waybills show: ...|$|E
5000|$|Behind every {{original}} of the <b>Air</b> <b>Waybill</b> are {{conditions of}} contract for carriage.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{purposes}} that an <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> serves, but its main functions are: ...|$|E
50|$|As {{long as the}} <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> {{is neither}} dated nor signed twice, the goods do not fall within {{the terms of the}} {{conditions}} of contract and therefore the carrier will not accept any responsibility for the goods. The validity of the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> and thus the contract of carriage expires upon delivery of the shipment to the consignee (or his authorised agent).|$|E
50|$|A freight {{forwarder}} offering a consolidation service, will issue its own <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> or bill of lading. From now on AWB {{will be used}} to refer to both. This is called a Forwarder's or House AWB with its equivalent House BL. These act as contracts of carriage between the shipper and the forwarder, who in this case becomes a Deemed Carrier. The forwarder in turn enters into contracts with one or more carriers, often using more than one mode of transportation. The contract of carriage between the forwarder and carrier is called a Master <b>Air</b> <b>Waybill</b> (MAWB or MBL). A House <b>Air</b> <b>Waybill</b> (HAWB) or Bill of Lading (HBL) could act as a multimodal transport document.|$|E
50|$|Waybills are {{non-negotiable}} documents unlike {{bills of}} lading which are negotiable. The words non-negotiable are printed clearly {{at the top}} of the <b>air</b> <b>waybill.</b> This means that the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> is a contract for transportation only and does not represent (the value of) merchandise mentioned in the box nature and quantity of goods. The ocean bill of lading, if negotiated, may represent (the value of) the goods and must be endorsed by the party ultimately accepting the goods.Although the AWB is a non-negotiable document, it can be used as a means of payment. This can be done only through the intermediary of a bank and only when the carriage is subject to a letter of credit. The <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> executed according to the terms of a letter of credit allows the shipper to present the original of the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> to the bank and collect the billed value of the shipped goods from the bank. The amount paid by the bank to the shipper will be debited to the consignee who ordered the goods. At the destination the carrier will only hand over the goods to the consignee on receipt of a bank release order from the consignee's bankers.|$|E
50|$|Most {{airlines}} use {{a different}} form called an <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> which lists additional items such as airport of destination, flight number, and time.|$|E
50|$|International air waybills {{that contain}} {{consolidated}} cargo are called master air waybills (MAWB). MAWBs have additional papers called house air waybills (HAWB). Each HAWB contains information {{of each individual}} shipment (consignee, contents, etc.) within the consolidation. International AWBs that are not consolidated (only one shipment in one bill) are called simple AWBs. A house <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> can also be created by a freight forwarder. When the shipment is booked, the airline issues a MAWB to the forwarder, who in turn issues their own house <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> to the customer.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> {{may also}} serve as an {{evidence}} if the carrier {{is in a position}} to insure the shipment and is requested to do so by the shipper.|$|E
5000|$|Although customs {{authorities}} require various documents like a commercial invoice, packing list, etc. the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> too is {{proof of the}} freight amount billed for the goods carried and {{may be needed to}} be presented for customs clearance ...|$|E
50|$|The rise of {{internet}} during {{in the years}} that followed contributed to increase the reliability and accessibility to the air cargo industry. Most airlines now offer to their customers real-time flight status and the booking and tracking options. In addition, the industry is adopting electronic procedures, such as the electronic <b>air</b> <b>waybill,</b> to reduce the amount of paper documentation accompanying each shipment and increasing the security and safety of the transportation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> must {{indicate}} that the goods have been accepted for carriage, {{and it must be}} signed or authenticated by the carrier or the named agent for or on behalf of the carrier. The signature or authentication of the carrier must be identified as carrier, {{and in the case of}} agent signing or authenticating, the name and the capacity of the carrier on whose behalf the agent signs or authenticates must be indicated.|$|E
5000|$|When the shipper {{delivers}} {{goods to}} be forwarded, {{he will get}} a receipt. The receipt is proof that the shipment was handed over in good order and condition and also that the shipping instructions, as contained in the Shipper's Letter of Instructions, are acceptable. After completion, an original copy of the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> {{is given to the}} shipper as evidence of the acceptance of goods and as proof of contract of carriage ...|$|E
50|$|The {{rights of}} the {{consignee}} under an <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> are regulated by the Warsaw Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, 1929 and the Montreal Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air 1999 and the relevant state laws (which may be one law chosen as the proper law by the parties, or any combination of laws representing the seller, buyer, consignor, and carrier.)This is very important as per export documents.|$|E
50|$|Imported {{goods are}} {{generally}} {{accompanied by a}} bill of lading or <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> describing the goods. For purposes of customs duty assessment, they must also be accompanied by an invoice documenting the transaction value. The goods on the bill of lading and invoice are classified and duty is computed by the importer or CBP. The amount of this duty is payable immediately, and must be paid before the goods can be imported. Most assessments of goods are now done by the importer and documentation filed with CBP electronically.|$|E
5000|$|A {{straight}} {{bill of lading}} by land or sea, or <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> are not {{documents of}} title to the goods they represent. They do no more than require delivery of the goods to the named consignee and (subject to the shipper's ability to redirect the goods) to no other. This differs from an [...] "order" [...] or [...] "bearer" [...] bill of lading which are possessory title documents and negotiable, i.e. they can be endorsed and so transfer the right to take delivery to the last endorsee. This aspect of shipping law is regulated by the Hague Rules, and the laws of individual countries, e.g. the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 and the U.S. Pomerene Act 1916. There is some international dispute as to whether the consignee on a straight bill must produce the bill in order to take delivery. The U.S. position is that the person taking delivery must prove his or her identity but, as in Hong Kong, {{there is no need to}} present the bill itself. In the UK there are conflicting obiter dicta in [...] "The Rafaela S" [...] 2003 2 Lloyd's Rep. 113 and [...] "The Happy Ranger" [...] 2002 2 AER (Comm) 23, so the matter must remain unclear even though there are serious problems, for example, arising from the everyday occurrence of cargo being discharged against letters of indemnity when original bills of lading are not yet available to be presented at the discharge port.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} topical issues of {{international}} air law, namely international regulation of air carrier's liability in carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo. The first multilateral treaty to consider and unify this topic was the Warsaw Convention in 1929. It prescribed the main {{requirements of the}} documents of carriage, i. e. the passenger ticket, the baggage check and the <b>air</b> <b>waybill.</b> In particular, the air carrier is liable for personal injury or death of passengers, loss or damage of baggage or cargo and for damage resulting from delay. The key points of the liability regime governed by the Warsaw Convention are presumptive liability and the maximum liability limits expressed in French Gold Francs. Due to the subsequent development of air transport these rules had to be modernized. The Warsaw Convention was amended with several Protocols and a Supplementary Convention, which together create the so-called "Warsaw system". The purpose of these documents was, amongst other things, to tighten up the liability regime while trying to establish strict liability and raise the liability limits. In 1999 a further unification of air carrier's liability took place {{with the creation of}} the Montreal Convention. Although it adopted some key liability provisions from previous documents, it stipulated [...] ...|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 39). Internship is a partial requirement of post graduation. As a student of Master of business administration analyzing today’s business world is very crucial. It is necessary {{to go through all}} fields of knowledge, both theoretical and practical. After completing two years MBA program, I was sent out to have practical knowledge in business life as a part of my academic program. In this report I had tried to focus my both theoretical and practical knowledge regarding freight practices. My internship topic is ‘Freight Forwarding business of UTi Pership”. Freight Forwarder is a firm specializing in arranging storage and shipping of merchandise on behalf of its shippers. It usually provides a full range of services including: tracking inland transportation, preparation of shipping and export documents, warehousing, booking cargo space, negotiating freight charges, freight consolidation, cargo insurance, and filing of insurance claims. Freight forwarders usually ship under their own bills of lading or air waybills (called house bill of lading or house <b>air</b> <b>waybill)</b> and their agents or associates at the destination (overseas freight forwarders) provide document delivery, deconsolidation, and freight collection services. The International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations (FIATA) shorthand description of the freight forwarder as the 'Architect of Transport' illustrates the commercial position of the forwarder relative to its client. Freight forwarding services negotiate the best possible price to move the product along the most economical route by working out various bids and choosing the one that best balances speed, cost and reliability. Freight forwarding service then undertakes the responsibility of arranging the transport from point of origin to destination. The history of Freight Forwarding is not too old. One of the earliest freight forwarders was Thomas Meadows and Company Limited of London, England, established in 1836. According to "Understanding the Freight Business," written and published by the executive staff of Thomas Meadows and Company in 1972, the advent of reliable rail transport and steamships created demand for the fledgling freight forwarding industry. Trade developed between Europe and North America, creating additional demand. The first international freight forwarders were innkeepers in London who held and re-forwarded the personal effects of their hotel guests. Forwarder responsibilities include advice on documentation and customs requirements in the country of destination. And the correspondent agent in overseas look after customers' goods and keep informed about matters that would affect movement of goods. In a single transaction, the forwarder may be acting as a carrier (principal) or as an agent for his customer or both. Mohammed Mehedi HasanM. Business Administratio...|$|E
