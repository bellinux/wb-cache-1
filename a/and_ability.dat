5|$|In {{his early}} years at Marseille, Nasri was {{deployed}} in several positions, most notably as a deep-lying midfielder and a wide midfielder primarily {{on the right side}} as he was deemed too small to play {{in the middle of the}} park. After two years of developing his physical traits, in the 2006–07 season, manager Albert Emon inserted Nasri into the playmaker role, where his vision, technical skill <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> to read and understand the game suited him. Since that season, Nasri has been primarily deployed in the position or as a central attacking midfielder at both club and international level. The player has personally admitted that playing centrally is his preference. However, as a result of his versatility, Nasri can also function on the wing and spent the majority of his career at Arsenal occupying the role in the team's 4–3–3 formation. His close control with the ball, speed, dribbling, crossing, <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> to use both feet suits the position well, which has resulted in former manager Arsène Wenger deploying Nasri in the role during the player's four-year stay at the club. Nasri often featured centrally for Arsenal in the absence of former club captain Cesc Fàbregas.|$|E

5|$|In the yeshiva world, the {{brightest}} students are highly desirable as chavrusas. However, there are {{pros and cons}} to learning with chavrusas who are stronger, weaker, or equal in knowledge <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> to the student. A stronger chavrusa will correct and fill in the student's knowledge and help him improve his learning techniques, acting more like a teacher. With a chavrusa who is equal in knowledge <b>and</b> <b>ability,</b> the student is forced to prove his point with logic rather than by right of seniority, which improves his ability to think logically, analyze other people's opinions objectively, and accept criticism. With a weaker chavrusa, who often worries over and questions each step, the student is forced to understand the material thoroughly, refine and organize his thoughts in a logical structure, present his viewpoint clearly, {{and be ready to}} justify each and every point. The stronger chavrusa helps the student acquire a great deal of information, but the weaker chavrusa helps the student learn how to learn. Yeshiva students are usually advised to have one of each of these three types of chavrusas in order to develop on all three levels.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} {{quarter of a century}} {{there have been a number}} of calls for changes in {{accounting}} education. Many of these have identified desired outcomes, i. e., the skills <b>and</b> <b>abilities</b> expected of accounting professionals and accounting educators, yet have not adequately addressed how these skills <b>and</b> <b>abilities</b> are acquired. A further understanding of the acquisition of skills <b>and</b> <b>abilities</b> by accounting educators may help inform faculty development endeavors. This study identifies 20 skills <b>and</b> <b>abilities</b> typically expected of accounting educators and then queries doctoral-qualified accounting faculty members as to the relative importance that various educational and work experiences have on one’s acquisition of these skills <b>and</b> <b>abilities.</b> The authors randomly surveyed 1, 200 doctoral-qualified accounting faculty members from Hasselback’s Accounting Faculty Directory and received 241 (20 %) usable responses within the six week allotted time frame. The results indicate that teaching experience was most influential in the acquisition of almost all of the skills <b>and</b> <b>abilities</b> directly associated with the teaching function yet, and somewhat surprising, accounting work experience was as influential as teaching in such areas as teaching in general and teaching accounting topics. Also, accounting work experience was more influential on one’s ability to teach than was graduate education. Doctoral education was most influential on one’s ability to conduct research. The authors also discuss other notable findings and their implications...|$|R
