50|$|In another movement, {{they dance}} {{sideways}} {{either in a}} clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. They stand in a semicircle and in the <b>anti-clockwise</b> <b>movement,</b> they take one step with the right foot {{to the right and}} immediately bring the left foot beside the right one. Thus they dance in a circle, flexing the knees after each step.|$|E
50|$|Electric {{toothbrushes}} are toothbrushes with replaceable moving or vibrating bristle heads. The {{two main}} types of electric toothbrushes are the sonic type {{which has a}} vibrating head, and the oscillating-rotating type in which the bristle head makes constant clockwise and <b>anti-clockwise</b> <b>movements.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{distributions}} of Ni, Cu and Zn have been monitored in the Irish Sea using fully automated voltammetric instrumentation and collection of seawater by underway pumping. The continuous real-time measurements provided high resolution data {{with a minimum}} risk of sample contamination. The surveys showed that the River Mersey was a significant contributor of Ni, Cu and Zn to the eastern Irish Sea and that the trace metal distribution was consistent with an <b>anti-clockwise</b> residual water <b>movement</b> in the eastern Irish Sea. The automated instrumentation is very useful for monitoring requirements for environmental impact assessments and can provide high resolution trace metal data for marine modelling purposes...|$|R
40|$|Objective: despite recent {{advances}} in medical imaging, pre-operative evaluation of liver tumors, whether benign or malignant, is often lacking in accuracy and precision. With the development of surgical laparoscopy, the benefits of diagnostic laparoscopy have been combined with those of operative ultrasound. This article aims to describe the technique of laparoscopic ultrasound of the liver, and to define its applications {{and the role of}} its association with diagnostic laparoscopy in the localization and assessment for resectability of liver tumors. Methods: after an initial visual inspection with the laparoscope, laparoscopic ultrasound is utilized to further examine the liver. This relies largely on recognition of branches of the portal vein and tributaries of the hepatic veins. During this procedure, the hepatic parenchyma is also examined. Minimal displacement of the transducer, using clockwise and <b>anti-clockwise</b> rotatory <b>movements,</b> allows a full exploration of the liver. Results: the combination of visual with sonographic laparoscopy allows accurate localization of benign and malignant hepatic tumors, as well as ultrasound-guided biopsies of these. Laparoscopic ultrasound can detect small lesions previously unseen by pre-operative imaging techniques. The relationship of tumors to adjacent blood vessels can be defined. Portal vein thrombosis can be diagnosed. Conclusion: curability and liver tumor resectability can be determined and the appropriate surgical treatment thus planned...|$|R
50|$|The ball is held {{between the}} thumb, {{forefinger}} {{and the middle}} finger and, instead of a conventional release, the ball is squeezed out and flicked by the fingers like a carrom player flicking the disc on a carrom board. It is different from wrist-bowled deliveries. Traditional leg-spin is bowled with <b>anti-clockwise</b> wrist <b>movement</b> for a right-armed bowler, while Muttiah Muralitharan's special type of off-spin is bowled with clockwise wrist movement. A finger-bowled delivery such as traditional off-spin is bowled with a clockwise finger movement. Carrom spin {{can be considered a}} third category of spin bowling after leg spin and off spin, as the middle finger and thumb flick or squeeze the ball out of the hand, like a carrom player flicking a striker in the indoor game of carrom. When the centre finger is gripped towards the leg side, the ball spins from leg to off; when the centre finger is gripped towards the off side, the ball spins from off to leg. Depending on the degree the ball is gripped towards the leg side, the carrom ball could also travel straight. The carrom ball can therefore spin to either the off or leg sides or travel straight (as opposed to the popular misconception that it only spins towards the off side).|$|R
