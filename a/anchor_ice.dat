50|$|Especially in the Antarctic, <b>anchor</b> <b>ice</b> {{has been}} implicated in drastic zonation of the subtidal fauna. Many animals are {{directly}} affected by the growth of <b>anchor</b> <b>ice,</b> and certain sponges {{have been shown to}} readily grow <b>anchor</b> <b>ice</b> and to be damaged by it. <b>Anchor</b> <b>ice</b> may also grow on animate or inanimate objects and lift them from the sea floor. In the Antarctic this will most likely result in the death of an organism, since during much of the year the ocean is covered by annual sea ice, and the organism is likely to become incorporated into this.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anchor</b> <b>ice</b> will {{generally}} form in fast-flowing rivers {{during periods of}} extreme cold. Due to {{the motion of the}} water, ice cover may not form consistently, and the water will quickly reach its freezing point due to mixing and contact with the atmosphere. Ice platelets generally form very quickly in the water column and on submerged objects once conditions are optimal for <b>anchor</b> <b>ice</b> formation. <b>Anchor</b> <b>ice</b> in rivers tends to be composed of numerous small crystals adhering to each other in small flocculent masses. <b>Anchor</b> <b>ice</b> in rivers can seriously disrupt hydro-electric power plants by significantly reducing flow or stopping turbines completely.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anchor</b> <b>ice</b> may {{be formed}} in the shallow {{intertidal}} or subtidal during storms in cold weather, when the uppermost layers of the water column are churned up by strong winds or waves. This type of <b>anchor</b> <b>ice</b> can be found primarily in the Arctic, where submerged ice may be observed to completely cover the substrate to depths of up to 2m, with some <b>anchor</b> <b>ice</b> cover observed at more than 4.5m depth.|$|E

50|$|Another form of <b>anchor</b> <b>ice</b> may be {{observed}} at {{the mouths of}} Arctic rivers where fresh water seeps {{out of the river}} bed into the ocean up through the sediment. <b>Anchor</b> <b>ice</b> forms if the seawater is below the freezing point of the river water.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anchor</b> <b>ice</b> {{crystals}} in the Antarctic {{are generally}} {{in the form}} of thin, circular platelets of 2-10 cm in diameter. Large masses of irregularly-oriented crystals form <b>anchor</b> <b>ice</b> formations, which may be as large as 4m in diameter when attached to large immovable objects on the sea floor.|$|E

On 26 August they reached Ice Haven, after rounding the northern extremity of the land. Here their vessel became <b>anchored</b> in <b>ice</b> and they wintered {{in a house}} built out of driftwood and planks from the tween decks and the deck-house of the vessel.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike Dots, Two Dots has power-ups, {{objectives}} and a campaign (series of levels), while lacking online multi-player. Objectives may include sinking <b>anchors,</b> breaking <b>ice,</b> or connecting dots together. At {{the start of}} the game, level one is unlocked, and other levels are unlocked as the player progresses. As a player completes a [...] "world", another one is unlocked. As of an update on September 9, 2015, there are 15 available worlds, which differ in gameplay elements, obstacles and/or objectives.|$|R

25|$|After {{the climbers}} had {{recovered}} {{and made their}} way to the tent at Camp VII, Gilkey was lost. He had been <b>anchored</b> to the <b>ice</b> slope as the exhausted climbers prepared the tent, and his muffled shouts were heard. When Bates and Streather returned to bring him to the tent, they found no sign of him. A faint groove in the snow suggested that an avalanche had taken place.|$|R

40|$|Key words: Rock slope; anti-sliding {{stability}} analysis; limit equilibrium method; groundwater pressure distribution Abstract: Based on {{the assumption}} of the improved groundwater pressure distribution, the calculation expression of anti-sliding stability factor for typical water-saturated rock slope is deduced through limit equilibrium method. Considering the combined effect of slope overload, seismic load, <b>anchoring</b> effect, <b>ice</b> frost, slip surface drag force and slope groundwater pressure, the comparative analysis of typical rock slope sliding stability under waterless and saturated conditions shows that, the outflow joint blocking and the groundwater levels rising have obvious adverse effects on the anti-sliding stability of rock slope. Figures about the relationship of stability factors and geometric factors were drawn and the anti-sliding stability factor can be directly obtained from these figures. All would be the references for the similar engineering projects...|$|R
50|$|<b>Anchor</b> <b>ice</b> {{is thought}} to be {{relatively}} common in the Antarctic, due to large ice shelves that occupy many areas of the continental coast. Studies and observations of <b>anchor</b> <b>ice</b> formation in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica have shown that the phenomenon regularly causes the formation of ice on the seafloor to depths of approximately 15m, and rarely to depths of approximately 30m.|$|E

5000|$|In glaciated terrain {{the risk}} of crevasses means that even {{technically}} easy walks {{require the use of}} rope, crampons and ice axes as well as knowledge of safety and rescue techniques. Techniques and equipment, the use of which can become especially important in high mountain tours, include crevasse rescue, the T <b>anchor,</b> the <b>ice</b> screw and snow protection. Walking with a rope requires a roped team to be formed and makes trekking alone dangerous. In addition, a certain level of fitness and height acclimatization is often unavoidable. Especially for mountain tours in high mountains such as the Himalayas, the Karakorum or the Andes, which reach elevations of over 6,000 metres above sea level, one or two weeks should be allowed dor acclimatization. Low temperatures may also be an important factor.|$|R

50|$|Surface lifts {{have many}} {{disadvantages}} compared to aerial lifts: they require more passenger skill, the surface must be continuous, they impede skiable terrain, are slow in speed, and of limited capacity.They are often utilized at glacier skiing resorts because their supports can be <b>anchored</b> in glacier <b>ice</b> {{due to the}} lower forces. Surface lifts have two advantages over aerial lifts: they can be exited before the lift reaches the top, and they can often continue operating in wind conditions that are too strong for a chairlift.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Anchor</b> <b>ice</b> {{is defined}} by the World Meteorological Organization as [...] "submerged ice {{attached}} or anchored to the bottom, irrespective of the nature of its formation". It may also be called bottom-fast ice. <b>Anchor</b> <b>ice</b> is most commonly observed in fast-flowing rivers during periods of extreme cold, at the mouths of rivers flowing into very cold seawater, in the shallow sub or intertidal during or after storms when the air temperature is below the freezing point of the water, and the subtidal in the Antarctic along ice shelves or near floating glacier tongues, and in shallow lakes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Anchor</b> <b>ice</b> {{that forms}} on the {{underside}} of sea ice {{is often referred to as}} platelet or congelation ice, and can be hard to distinguish from that formed due to the cooling of the sea ice cover by cold atmospheric conditions.|$|E
500|$|After Fram was <b>anchored</b> to <b>ice</b> in an inlet in the {{south-eastern}} {{corner of}} the Bay, Amundsen selected a site for the expedition's main hut, [...] from the ship. Six teams of dogs were used to move supplies to the site, as work on erecting the hut began. Bjaaland and Stubberud laid the foundations deep into the ice, levelling the sloping ground. Because the prevailing winds came from the east, the hut was erected on an east-west axis, with the door facing west; {{in this way the}} wind caught only the shorter eastern wall. The roof was in place by 21January, and six days later the hut was complete. By then a large supply of meat—including 200seals—had been brought to the base, for use by the shore party and to be laid in depots before the journey to the pole. The base was dubbed Framheim, [...] "the home of Fram".|$|R
25|$|A death spiral is a {{required}} element of pair skating. There are four varieties distinguished by the lady's edge {{and direction of}} motion. The man performs a pivot, one toe <b>anchored</b> in the <b>ice,</b> while holding the hand of his partner, who circles him on a deep edge with her body almost parallel to the ice. As of 2011, the woman's head must at some time reach her skating knee. The man must also be in a full pivot position and the death spiral must be held for a minimum amount of rotation, depending on the level.|$|R

50|$|Sighting Greenland on June 20, the {{expedition}} made harbor at the Crown Prince Islands (Whale Fish) in Disco Bay. From a British mail ship, {{they learned that}} British relief efforts were heading for the same region. Advance and Rescue left the islands on June 29, encountering the ice field on July 1 while proceeding towards Upernavik. By July 7, the pack ice was dense enough to compel the Advance to tow the Rescue to prevent the vessels from becoming separated. The crews were periodically sent onto the ice to 'bore' a passage by hand, using crowbars, <b>ice</b> <b>anchors</b> and boathooks. For 21 days the ships were held nearly fast, only heaved slowly forward by efforts of the crew.|$|R
50|$|A death spiral is {{an element}} unique to pair skating. The man {{performs}} a pivot, one toe <b>anchored</b> in the <b>ice,</b> while holding the hand of his partner, who circles him on a deep edge with her body almost parallel to the ice.
