In an interview a year later {{she said she did}} not know what she was doing in her first tape and did not remember <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Her second video, also for Max-A, was Don't Close Your Eyes and Hayasaka said that it was particularly hard for her, bringing her to tears, because she had little experience with adult toys. Hayasaka was acknowledged by fans for her work in her debut year by being named Best New Actress at the 2001 X City Grand Prix Awards held in December 2001.|$|E

Referring to this moment in a 2012 interview, Ervin stated, [...] "I didn't know <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> what <b>it</b> was like to be part of the black experience. But now I do. It's like winning gold and having a bunch of old white people ask you what it's like to be black. That is my black experience." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1953, metalsmith Margret Craver saw a pin {{decorated}} {{using the}} technique. [...] Craver began studying the technique, researching and testing {{it over the}} course of about thirteen years to reproduce it. [...] Because the technique was not being practiced, and there were no instructional texts in existence, the work was slow, and Craver had to design her own tools.

60|$|She {{was tall}} and very fair, with a face that seemed plain in repose, but which bewitched him when she smiled.

5000|$|In 1953, Craver first {{encountered}} the disused enameling technique en résille, in which enamel-coated metal foil {{is embedded in}} glass.

[...] Because the technique was not being practiced, and there were no instructional texts in existence, the work was slow, and Craver had to design her own tools.

5000|$|Aribaba, another {{writer for}} Jaguda gave the song 5 out of 10 stars, adding: [...] "My first thought (as {{well as that}} of many others) was that, this song sounds just like Aboki. Now it’s one thing to “stick with the same style”, but it’s another thing to {{photocopy}} and song and change <b>a</b> few <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I’m <b>an</b> Ice Prince fan, but I must say I was kinda disappointed. Paper chasing tactics I guess. Now with that being said, the song will probably still do well, and as a stand-alone song it’s actually good. The beat is solid from ChopStix, and Ice price style stays the same (obviously) and the chorus is nice, just like with Aboki. It’s just not fresh and doesn’t get one excited." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And in the meantime, we'll look around," [...] Mrs. Mortimer invited. [...] "I want to {{show you}} everything, and tell you how I make it go. Afterward, we'll sit down, and I'll tell you about the beginning.

60|$|So, {{though he}} was so eager and so hungry, he made himself keep {{perfectly}} still, while he studied out a plan. By and by he stole ever so carefully around back of the barn to the cowyard. Some of those fat hens were scratching in the straw of the cowyard. Just outside the cowyard was a pile of old boards. Reddy crawled behind this pile of old boards and then crouched and settled himself to be patient. He knew {{that sooner or later}} one of those fat hens would be likely {{to come out of the}} cowyard.

60|$|Unc' Billy Possum, who, by {{slipping}} {{up behind}} her and biting one of her heels, had made her let go of Peter, grinned down at her from a safe place in a tree. Jimmy Skunk stood grinning {{at her in the}} most provoking manner, and she couldn't do <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> because she had no desire to have Jimmy use his little bag of perfume. So she talked herself out and then with many parting threats of what she would do, she started for home. Unc' Billy noticed that she limped a little with the foot he had nipped so hard, and he couldn't help feeling just a little bit sorry for her.|$|E
5000|$|As {{described}} by Jim Grey on Down the Road: [...] "It was a TV show about TV, and there wasn’t <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the medium <b>it</b> didn’t lampoon and skewer. It was a sketch comedy before sketch comedies were cool - running an incredible 19 seasons starting in 1967, it beat [...] "Monty Python's Flying Circus" [...] and Saturday Night Live to the air. It won awards; it got national press; it launched careers. But unless {{you lived in}} or near South Bend, Indiana, you never saw Beyond Our Control." ...|$|R

6000|$|My dearest Isa, ... You {{have seen}} in the papers that Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer has had an {{accident}} in the arm, which keeps him away from the House of Commons, and even from the Haymarket, where they are acting his play ('Not so bad as we seem') with some success. Well, here is <b>a</b> curious <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Mr. Lytton told us some time ago, that, by several clairvoyantes, without knowledge or connection with one another, an impending accident had been announced to him, 'not fatal, but serious.' Mr. Lytton said, 'I have been very uneasy <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and nervous as every letter arrived, but nearly three months having passed, I began to think they must have made a mistake--only it is curious that they all should all make a mistake of the same kind precisely.' When after this we saw the accident in the paper, it was effective, as you may suppose! ...|$|R
5000|$|Film critic Dennis Schwartz panned the film, writing, [...] "It's {{the first}} of 19 times that Terence Hill and Bud Spencer would be paired together.

But those who have a strong stomach for all the dumb {{violence}} and can overlook the awkward execution of the story, may be the ones best suited for this bloody awful film." ...|$|E
5000|$|The strip is fatalistic; it {{is obvious}} that the bakers will never reform, their {{customers}} will never get proper service, and no-one is doing <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Nevertheless, they carry on. As art critic Emily Mears remarks, [...] "somehow, with the remarkable fortitude of true career drunks and in a rather sweet depiction of brotherly love, they prop each other up and return, strip after strip, to bake again." [...] Some storylines fail to resolve themselves and end indeterminately, reinforcing the character's cyclical and depressing existence. In one strip, one of the bakers is bitten by a stray dog he has befriended, but he doesn't notice. [...] "Your mouth is pissing blood" [...] remarks the other baker.|$|E

5000|$|The {{band had}} a sizable hit in 1982 {{with the song}} [...] "Mexican Radio", which {{received}} considerable play on the newly aired MTV. Ridgway recalled, [...] "Marc and I {{used to go to}} rehearsal in my '67 Mustang and we were really fed up with Los Angeles radio. We were very cynical and we thought it was much better to tune into these Mexican radio stations that would waft in across the border — of course, now the stations are all over Los Angeles. Anyway, when we'd come across one of these stations playing mariachi music, we'd get all excited — 'Great, man, I'm on a Mexican radio!' I didn't think <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> until one day, Marc came in with this little one-minute (demo tape) sketch of that great guitar lick and him singing, 'I'm on a Mexican radio,' kind of mumbling it.

5000|$|It is at {{this point}} that Myres picks up the argument. Noting that thalassokratesai, “be a thalassokrat,” meaning “rule the waves,” was used in a number of authors: {{elsewhere}} by Diodorus, by Polybius, 2nd century BC historian, of Carthage, of Chios by Strabo, 1st century BC geographer and some others, he supposes that s stock document might have been available to them all (but not necessarily, the cautious Myres points out). [...] The document can be dated by its content: a list of 17 thalassocracies extending from the Lydian after the fall of Troy to the Aeginetan, which ended with the cession of power to Athens in 480 BC. The Battle of Salamis included 200 new Athenian triremes plus all the ships of its new ally, Aegina. Despite various revolts Aegina went on {{to become part of the}} Delian League, an imperial treaty of the new Athenian thalassocracy. Thucydides writes of it after 432 BC, but Herodotus, who visited Athens “as late as 444 B.C.” does not know <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> This tentative date for the Eusebian list does not exclude the possibility of an earlier similar document used by Herodotus.|$|E

5000|$|The {{following}} day, {{the kids}} are sailing the ocean on a catamaran. Jeff soundly chides Gidget for letting the [...] "game" [...] get out of control, but he backs off when she tells him that she won't tolerate such a scolding from anyone...except a husband. Meanwhile, Abby is fed up with Gidget and decides to take her down a notch by spreading a wanton rumor about her. She implies to her mother that Gidget has slept with Eddie and other guys, rationalizing that it is half-true because Gidget had said that she gave herself [...] "completely to that Moondoggie person". Mitzi relays this to Dorothy, who refuses to believe it.

2500|$|On {{the overall}} {{power of the}} song, Jagger {{continued}} in Rolling Stone: [...] "It has a very hypnotic groove, a samba, which has a tremendous hypnotic power, rather like good dance music. It doesn't speed up or slow down. It keeps this constant groove. Plus, the actual samba rhythm is a great one to sing on, {{but it is also}} got some other suggestions in it, an undercurrent of being primitive—because it is a primitive African, South American, Afro-whatever-you-call-that rhythm (candomblé). [...] So to white people, it has <b>a</b> very sinister <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> But forgetting the cultural colors, it is a very good vehicle for producing a powerful piece. It becomes less pretentious because it is a very unpretentious groove. If it had been done as a ballad, it wouldn't have been as good." ...|$|R
