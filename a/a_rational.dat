5|$|Jewish {{philosophy}} {{divides the}} 613 mitzvot into three groups—laws that have <b>a</b> <b>rational</b> explanation {{and would probably}} be enacted by most orderly societies (mishpatim), laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torah's command (edot), and laws {{that do not have}} <b>a</b> <b>rational</b> explanation (chukim). Some Jewish scholars say that kashrut should be categorized as laws {{for which there is no}} particular explanation, since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this line of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's authority, and man must obey without asking why. However, Maimonides believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. <b>A</b> <b>rational</b> being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is <b>a</b> <b>rational</b> necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E

40|$|We {{prove that}} there exist some infinitary {{rational}} relations which are analytic but non Borel sets, giving {{an answer to}} a question of Simonnet [Sim 92].

Furthermore one cannot decide whether <b>a</b> given infinitary <b>rational</b> relation is <b>a</b> Borel set or a Σ 1 1 -complete set. We prove some recursive analogues to these properties.

5|$|Amalthea orbits Jupiter at a {{distance}} of 181000km (2.54Jupiter radii). The orbit of Amalthea has an eccentricity of 0.003 and an inclination of 0.37° relative to the equator of Jupiter. Such appreciably nonzero values of inclination and eccentricity, though still small, are unusual for an inner satellite and {{can be explained by the}} influence of the innermost Galilean satellite, Io: in the past Amalthea has passed through several mean-motion resonances with Io that have excited its inclination and eccentricity (in a mean-motion resonance the ratio of orbital periods of two bodies is <b>a</b> <b>rational</b> number like m:n).|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still bear <b>a</b> <b>rational</b> relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E
5|$|Kant's Formula of Autonomy {{expresses the}} idea that an agent is obliged to follow the Categorical Imperative because of their {{rational}} will, rather than any outside influence. Kant believed that any moral law motivated {{by the desire to}} fulfill some other interest would deny the Categorical Imperative, leading him to argue that the moral law must only arise from <b>a</b> <b>rational</b> will. This principle requires people to recognize the right of others to act autonomously and means that, as moral laws must be universalisable, what is required of one person is required of all.|$|E

Ancient Tamil Nadu (part of Tamilakkam) had a {{different}} stratification of society in four or five regions (Tinai), determined by natural surroundings and adequate means of living. Periyar also argued that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be devoid of rationalism do not create castes, or differences of high and low in their own species. But man, considered to be <b>a</b> <b>rational</b> being, was suffering from these because of religion and discrimination.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{eventually}} {{decided to}} return to his theological studies and, in 1752, matriculated at Daventry, a Dissenting academy. Because he had already read widely, Priestley was allowed to skip {{the first two years of}} coursework. He continued his intense study; this, together with the liberal atmosphere of the school, shifted his theology further leftward and he became <b>a</b> <b>Rational</b> Dissenter.

5|$|Taking a {{negative}} real number b to <b>a</b> <b>rational</b> power u/v, where u/v is in lowest terms, yields a positive real result if u is even, and hence v is odd, because then b'u is positive; and yields {{a negative}} real result, if u and v are both odd, because then b'u is negative. The case of odd u and even v cannot be treated this way within the reals, {{since there is}} no real number x such that , the value of b'u/v in this case must use the imaginary unit i, as described more fully in the section § Powers of complex numbers.|$|E

The Aristotelian soul died with the animal and was thus purely biological. Different types of organism possessed different types of soul.

Humans, uniquely, had a vegetative, a sensitive, and <b>a</b> <b>rational</b> soul, capable of thought and reflection.|$|E
