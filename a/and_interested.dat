5|$|Although {{not very}} much is known about Allen's childhood, the town of Cornwall was {{frontier}} territory in the 1740s. By the time Allen reached his teens, the area, while still a difficult area in which to make a living, began to resemble a town, with wood-frame houses beginning to replace the rough cabins of the early settlers. Joseph Allen died in 1755; {{at the time of}} his death he was one of the wealthier landowners in the area, ran a successful farm, and had previously served as town selectman. Allen had, before his father's death, begun studies under a minister in the nearby town of Salisbury with the goal of gaining admission to Yale College. Allen's brother Ira recalled that, even at a young age, Allen was curious <b>and</b> <b>interested</b> in learning.|$|E

Testing revealed that at high altitude, even 2 g could cause death in an unpressurised cabin and without appropriate clothing. This new technology, along with special clothing and oxygen masks, was researched and tested.

For a while Flagler's arrival did disturb their quiet, as Flagler brought in dredges to deepen the Cape Florida Channel and the approaches {{to the mouth of}} the Miami River, muddying the formerly clear waters of Biscayne Bay. Soon, however, a shorter route from the ocean to Miami was dredged through the southern end of what is now Miami Beach, at Government Cut, and the Cape Florida Channel was allowed to return to a natural state.|$|E

40|$|In {{its general}} form, {{stakeholder}} theory posits {{an extension of}} the ecology. It claims that there are other stakes <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> than those posited by shareholder value theory (Freeman et al. 2004; Jensen and Sandström 2011), and some stakeholder theory proponents argue that the natural environment is also to be considered as a stakeholder (Driscoll and Starik 2004; Norton 2007). It is a positive claim – there are more stakes <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> – <b>and</b> a moral one – we should look towards more interests in order to complete the analysis. With this framing, stakeholder theory seeks to identify stakes <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> which may be difficult but in principle achievable; it also seeks to make analysis of organized activity such as (global) business into a concern with the relative power of stakes <b>and</b> <b>interests.</b> These concerns are highly relevant but they face the barrier that if stakes <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> are positively there, the analysis becomes static and will pay less attention to both the formation and to power-effects of stakes <b>and</b> <b>interest...</b>|$|R

Gavin becomes {{intrigued}} by Liz and invites her to spend the weekend with him, which she accepts. She wonders how the relationship between them will work, as he is agoraphobic. Gavin explains his daily routines to Liz, and also discloses that due to his phobias, he cannot be intimate with women. Liz starts to think that maybe a relationship with Gavin could work. As Liz gets ready to leave, Gavin admits {{to her that he}} is not agoraphobic, and that he is under house arrest for arson, fraud, embezzlement, and racketeering. This shocks Liz, and when she returns to New York, she tells Jack about it. Jack feels awful for investing NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) money with Gavin, after Gavin told him he was forming a new company <b>and</b> <b>interested</b> Jack to be part of it. Later, Gavin escapes from house arrest and shows up at the 30 Rock studios. There, he tells Liz that {{he was on his way}} to the Canada–US border but came back to bring her with him. After Liz refuses to go with him, and not wanting to go to prison, Gavin climbs to the top of the TGS with Tracy Jordan set and threatens to jump. Jack tries to talk Gavin out of jumping, distracting him in the process, resulting in Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tackling Gavin down.|$|E
5|$|Lem {{was awarded}} an honorary {{membership}} in the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) in 1973. SFWA Honorary membership is given {{to people who do}} not meet the publishing criteria for joining the regular membership, but who would be welcomed as members had their work appeared in the qualifying English-language publications. Lem, however, never had a high opinion of American science fiction, describing it as ill-thought-out, poorly written, <b>and</b> <b>interested</b> more in making money than in ideas or new literary forms. After his eventual American publication, when he became eligible for regular membership, his honorary membership was rescinded, an action that some of the SFWA members apparently intended as a rebuke, and it seems that Lem interpreted it as such. Lem was invited to stay on with the organization with a regular membership, but declined. After many members (including Ursula K. Le Guin) protested against Lem's treatment by the SFWA, a member offered to pay his dues. Lem never accepted the offer.|$|E

5|$|Ray Davies {{travelled}} to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate {{an end to}} the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, {{opening up}} an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters <b>and</b> <b>interested</b> audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in the District of Columbia, Yamashita visited the Japanese Legation, and in March 1904, the Japanese naval attaché, Commander Takeshita Isamu, took Yamashita to the White House to meet President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt practiced wrestling and boxing while in the White House, and he had received jujutsu jackets from William Sturgis Bigelow and jujutsu lessons from J. J. O'Brien, a Philadelphia police officer who had studied jujutsu while living in Nagasaki. Roosevelt was impressed with Yamashita's skill, and during March and April 1904, Yamashita gave judo lessons to the President <b>and</b> <b>interested</b> family and staff in {{a room at the}} White House.

5|$|Still {{enduring}} is {{the debate}} {{as to why}} Voss chose to fight on against clearly almost impossible odds rather than disengage from the action. However, {{it is possible that}} he wanted to close the kill gap between himself and the Red Baron, by shooting down some British aircraft, so he stayed on. Although Voss's apparent refusal to retreat is not mentioned in the contemporary English combat reports, nor in McCudden's autobiography written in June and July 1918, McCudden is credited with the observation that Voss seemingly rejected several opportunities to disengage and withdraw from the tactically grave situation in which he found himself. In 1942 Hector Bolitho and James Ira Thomas Jones received letters from both Chidlaw-Roberts and Bowman concerning their recall of Voss's last stand. Bowman read and savaged the Chidlaw-Roberts account for its inaccuracies, although his own account had obvious errors. At the same time Bowman also stated that he believed Voss had an opportunity to disengage and save himself, but had deliberately chosen instead to fight in spite of the overwhelmingly unequal situation with which he was faced. This is the earliest positively identified historical source for the assertion that Voss rejected chances for a safe retreat that were open to him. The dogfight remains a subject of debate and controversy among combat aviation historians <b>and</b> <b>interested</b> parties.|$|E

Even when these forms of relationship are inevitable and they are playing a crucial role in public policy decision-making. The problem of the project’s – how and to what extent do Kaunas City LSDP Department <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups relationship or not relationship? The project’s object is – political parties, <b>interest</b> groups <b>and</b> relationship between them. The subject of this project’s is the relationship between Kaunas City LSDP Department <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups. The project’s aim – to examine the relationship between Kaunas City LSDP Department <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups. The objectives of the project: to analyse theoretical aspects of the relationship between political parties <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups; to prepare the research methodology of the relationship between Kaunas City LSDP Department <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups; to typologise interest groups active in Kaunas; to create of Kaunas City LSDP Department <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups relationship model. The methods used are: analysis of scientific literature, analysis of documents, descriptive statistics, and semi-structured interview. The first chapter discusses and systemises information about the concept of relationship between political parties <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups, functions, types, etc. The key differences and similarities are identified. Also, the features of relationship between political parties <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups are analyses, and reviewed relations of the Social Democratic Party with interest groups. The second chapter presents the empirical research methodology. The third chapter provides the results of the empirical study. This chapter presents LSDP and its Kaunas City Department. It identifies social democratic provisions in relation to <b>interest</b> groups <b>and</b> typologises <b>interest</b> groups active in Kaunas.
