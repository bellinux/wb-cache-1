5|$|After Syria became {{independent}} in 1946, al-Bakri joined the pro-Western and Arab nationalist People's Party. President al-Atassi assigned him ambassador to Jordan, {{ruled by the}} Hashemites, after al-Bakri refused the ambassadorial post to Saudi Arabia, <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> he opposed ideologically. Following Adib al-Shishakli's seizure of the presidency in 1953, al-Bakri resigned. After al-Shishakli stepped down in 1954, al-Bakri {{became president of the}} People's Party. He was unsuccessful in establishing a significant support base in Damascus and resigned from political life in April 1957. He died in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan {{wasted no}} time in organising his new ministry, taking several {{portfolios}} for himself, and again taking the position of Treasurer of South Australia. Deputy Premier Des Corcoran took on most infrastructure portfolios—Marine and Harbours, and Public Works. Corcoran became the face of the Dunstan ministry in its relationship with the Labor caucus, with his ability to use his strong manner to settle disputes. Bert Shard became Health Minister, overseeing the construction and planning of new, major public hospitals: the Flinders Medical Centre and Modbury Hospital. Hugh Hudson took on the Education portfolio, an important role in <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> was determined to bring about profound change to the South Australian education system. Geoff Virgo, the new Transport Minister, was to deal with the Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study (MATS) plans. Len King was made Attorney-General and Aboriginal Affairs Minister despite being a new member of parliament. Dunstan formed a strong circle of loyal ministers around him, in a style radically different from his predecessors.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the {{consumption}} function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E

5|$|International {{recognition}} {{of the new government}} did not prove to be difficult. The Western powers were not pleased with the Third Seimas when it ratified the non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in September. They were looking for <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> would change the priorities of Lithuanian foreign policy. It was therefore not surprising that the British Daily Telegraph, the French Le Matin, and the United States' New York Times wrote that the coup was expected to curtail the move towards friendly relations with the Soviet Union and normalize relations with Poland; the anti-democratic and unconstitutional nature of the coup was not emphasized. The Western press reported the news calmly, or assessed it as a positive development in the Lithuanian struggle against Bolshevism. International diplomatic opinion held that a strong authoritarian leader would provide internal stability, and that even during the earlier years of the republic Lithuania had not been genuinely democratic, since many essential freedoms were curtailed under martial law.|$|E

25|$|With {{a general}} {{election}} due in 1959, which Labour was widely expected to win, CND's founders envisaged a campaign by eminent individuals to secure <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> would adopt its policies: the unconditional renunciation of the use, production of or dependence upon nuclear weapons by Britain and the bringing about of a general disarmament convention; halting the flight of planes armed with nuclear weapons; ending nuclear testing; not proceeding with missile bases; and not providing nuclear weapons to any other country.|$|E

His election in 1981 unseated longstanding mayor Gordon Paquette and drastically altered the political landscape of the city. Mayor Sanders created <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> was run by young Progressives, including Peter Clavelle, who was elected mayor of the city when Sanders stepped down to run for higher office. Peter Clavelle, Burlington's longest-serving mayor, held the office from 1989 to 1993, and again from 1995 to 2006.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in Federalist No. 51, Madison {{argued that}} to create <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> relied {{primarily}} on the good nature of the incumbent to ensure proper government was folly. Institutions must be in place to check incompetent or malevolent leaders. Most importantly, no single branch of government ought to have control over any single aspect of governing. Thus, all {{three branches of government}} must have some control over the military, and the system of checks and balances maintained among the other branches would serve to help control the military.|$|E

25|$|The {{national}} debt fell {{into three categories}} after the American Revolution. The first was the $12 million owed to foreigners, mostly money borrowed from France. There was general agreement to pay the foreign debts at full value. The national government owed $40 million and state governments owed $25 million to Americans who had sold food, horses, and supplies to the revolutionary forces. There were also other debts that consisted of promissory notes issued during the Revolutionary War to soldiers, merchants, and farmers who accepted these payments {{on the premise that}} the new Constitution would create <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> would pay these debts eventually.|$|E
25|$|Support for the LRC was {{boosted by}} the 1901 Taff Vale Case, a dispute between strikers and a railway company {{that ended with}} the union being ordered to pay £23,000 damages for a strike. The {{judgement}} effectively made strikes illegal since employers could recoup the cost of lost business from the unions. The apparent acquiescence of the Conservative Government of Arthur Balfour to industrial and business interests (traditionally the allies of the Liberal Party {{in opposition to the}} Conservative's landed interests) intensified support for the LRC against <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> appeared to have little concern for the industrial proletariat and its problems.|$|E

25|$|Elba's {{next film}} was Legacy (2010), {{in which he}} portrayed a black ops soldier who returns to Brooklyn after a failed mission in Eastern Europe, where he has {{undertaken}} a journey looking for retribution.

25|$|On 12 January 2010, at 4:53pm local time, Haiti {{was struck}} by a magnitude-7.0 {{earthquake}}. This was the country's most severe earthquake in over 200 years. The 2010 Haiti earthquake was reported to have left up to 316,000 people dead and 1.6 million homeless, though later reports found these numbers to have been grossly inflated, and put the death toll between 46,000 and 85,000. The country has yet to recover from the 2010 earthquake and a subsequent and massive Haiti cholera outbreak that was triggered when cholera-infected waste from a MINUSTAH peacekeeping station contaminated the country's main river, the Artibonite. The country has yet to fully recover, due to both the severity of the damage Haiti endured in 2010, as well as <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>that</b> was ineffective well before the earthquake.|$|E
