He reminded the Athenians that they would be leaving powerful enemies behind them if they sent a force to Sicily, and warned that they would be opening hostilities with enemies too difficult and numerous to conquer and rule. Nicias also attacked Alcibiades's credibility, claiming that he and his allies were inexperienced and self-aggrandizing young men eager to lead Athens into war for their own ends.|$|E
25|$|Soon <b>after</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> event, the Highland Games began {{being held}} at the Basin Reserve. The games were {{organised}} by the Wellingtonian Caledonian Society, of which their headquarters, The Caledonian Hotel, still stands towards {{the south of the}} Basin Reserve. The society offered up prize money which brought many competitors to the region. Due to their success, the society petitioned to have new grandstands built at the western end of the Basin Reserve. They would measure 44ft by 20ft and would cost approximately £250–£300. The stands would also hold food stalls and ground keepers. However, for the following years, even up until reportedly 1872, the Basin Reserve grounds were still extremely swampy, with small pools of swamp water and various weeds and shrubs sprouting over the fields. In late 1872, horses were used {{to level the playing field}} and this greatly improved the conditions.|$|E

Shanina was appointed a commander of that platoon. Three days later, southeast of Vitebsk, Shanina killed her first German soldier. In Shanina's own words, recorded by an anonymous author, her legs gave way <b>after</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> encounter and she slid down into the trench, saying, [...] "I've killed a man." [...] Concerned, the other women ran up saying, [...] "That was a fascist you finished off!" [...] Seven months later, Shanina wrote in her diary that she was now killing the enemy in cold blood and saw the meaning {{of her life in}} her actions. She wrote that if she had to do everything over again, she would still strive to enter the sniper academy and would go to the front again.|$|E

500|$|For years, Al Costello {{had been}} working on an idea for a new tag team; he even knew who he wanted for a partner: a wrestler he had worked with some years ago named Roy Heffernan. Because Costello and Heffernan had lost touch over the years, the idea {{remained}} dormant until Costello toured Hawaii in 1956. Costello mentioned his idea of an [...] "Ultra Australian" [...] tag team to fellow wrestler, and future promoter, Joe Blanchard. Blanchard happened to be a good friend of Roy Heffernan and knew he was working in Stampede Wrestling at the time. Blanchard put the two in touch with each other, and Costello was soon off to Calgary, Alberta, Canada to join Heffernan and finally make his tag team a reality. Costello and Heffernan debuted as [...] "The Fabulous Kangaroos" [...] on 3 May 1957 for Stu Hart’s Stampede Wrestling promotion in a match against Maurice LaPointe and Tony Baillargeon. Only weeks <b>after</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> match, The Kangaroos were working with the top tag teams in the promotion.|$|E
500|$|On April 12, 1861, the American Civil War {{began as}} Confederate troops {{attacked}} Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina. Grant {{wrote to his}} father in a letter of April 21 that [...] "we have a government and laws and a flag, and they must all be sustained. There are but two parties now, Traitors and Patriots ..." [...] Two days after the attack, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers and a mass meeting was held in Galena to assess the crisis and encourage recruitment. Before the attack, Grant had not reacted strongly to Southern secession. The news {{came as a shock}} in Galena, and Grant shared his neighbors' concern about the war. The captain of the local militia nominated Grant, the only man in town with professional military training, to lead the recruitment effort. A speech by his father's attorney, John Aaron Rawlins, stirred Grant's patriotism. Rawlins later became Grant's aide-de-camp and close friend during the war. Grant recalled with satisfaction that <b>after</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> recruitment meeting in Galena, [...] "I never went into our leather store again." ...|$|E
500|$|Both {{sides were}} willing. Catmull and fellow Pixar co-founder Alvy Ray Smith had long wanted {{to produce a}} computer-animated feature. In addition, Disney had {{licensed}} Pixar's Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), and that made it the largest customer for Pixar's computers. Jobs made it apparent to Katzenberg that although Disney was happy with Pixar, {{it was not the}} other way around: [...] "We want to do a film with you," [...] said Jobs. [...] "That would make us happy." [...] At this same time, Peter Schneider, president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, was potentially interested in making a feature film with Pixar. When Catmull, Smith and head of animation Ralph Guggenheim met with Schneider in the summer of 1990, they found the atmosphere to be puzzling and contentious. They later learned that Katzenberg intended that if Disney were to make a film with Pixar, it would be outside Schneider's purview, which aggravated Schneider. <b>After</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> meeting, the Pixar contingent went home with low expectations and was surprised when Katzenberg called for another conference. Catmull, Smith, and Guggenheim were joined by Bill Reeves (head of animation research and development), Jobs, and Lasseter. They brought with them an idea for a half-hour television special called A Tin Toy Christmas. They reasoned that a television program would be a sensible way to gain experience before tackling a feature film.|$|E

The events included athletics, racing, dancing and later wood-chopping and cycling. However, the ground was still swampy in some areas, but was remedied in late 1872. This allowed the first first-class game, [...] Wellington against Auckland, to be played on 30 November 1873, which Wellington won easily. Another first at the Basin Reserve is reputedly what was the first game of rugby in the North Island. The first rugby game held at the Basin Reserve was between the Wellington football team and the crew of HMS Rosario, which the sailors won by a single goal.|$|E
