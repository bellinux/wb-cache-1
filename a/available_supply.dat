5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} {{regarding the use of}} pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of <b>available</b> <b>supply.</b> Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a shortage, and that the shortage should be corrected by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds <b>available</b> <b>supply</b> {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E

5|$|Neodymium–iron–boron magnets {{can have}} up to 6% of the {{neodymium}} substituted by dysprosium to raise the coercivity for demanding applications, such as drive motors for electric vehicles and generators for wind turbines. This substitution would require up to 100grams of dysprosium per electric car produced. Based on Toyota's projected 2million units per year, the use of dysprosium in applications such as this would quickly exhaust its <b>available</b> <b>supply.</b> The dysprosium substitution may also be useful in other applications because it improves the corrosion resistance of the magnets.|$|E

40|$|This Chapter {{describes}} {{methods for}} defining {{the level of}} damage from an event, {{its impact on the}} functional status of the affected society, and for identifying the needs that result from the damage. The event may produce damage to the population (injuries, death), its constructions and societal functions, and/or to the environment. Societal functions are described as production functions with inputs, transformations, consumption of resources, and outputs. Distinction between <b>available</b> <b>supplies,</b> requirements, and needs is stressed. The differences between damage assessments and needs assessments are described. Needs for goods and services that are greater than the <b>available</b> level of <b>supplies</b> produces deficits. The concept of thresholds of available resources required to maintain the pre-event functional state, those necessary to sustain basic functional states, and those required for survival is developed. Surplus of <b>available</b> <b>supplies</b> is subdivided into those needed for contingencies and those that comprise luxuries. Indicators are required that define either the level of function or the level of <b>available</b> <b>supplies.</b> Distribution of <b>available</b> <b>supplies</b> (who receives them) impacts whether critical and functional requirements of a population, or part of the affected population, are satisfied. When critical requirements are not met, the crude mortality rate increases. Severity scoring of the damage sustained and the effects of responses is described. All damage and needs assessments and responses to them relate to the pre-event state of the affected society, and the objective of disaster responses is to return the affected society to its pre-event functional state...|$|R

Elliptical galaxies are largely devoid of this gas, and so form few new stars.

25|$|A key {{component}} {{in building the}} tunnel was the readily <b>available</b> <b>supply</b> of precast deck segments nearby. The project required 1.6 kilometres of girders so Soncin, who was contracted by Fairmont Developments to construct the extension of Simcoe Street, built a precast facility on site. A total of 153 girders were produced in three months. Fifty-one girders were post tensioned and 102 girders were normally reinforced.|$|E

There exists ample water but the threat of widespread contamination to the aquifers is legitimate as untreated wastewater, stormwater, and industrial effluents infiltrate subterranean supplies.|$|E
25|$|Leakage was {{affected}} by springs breaking through the clay lining of the canal bed.

In a further attempt to prevent water loss, at King's Reach, the section immediately east of Sapperton Tunnel, the canal was lined with concrete rather than puddle clay.|$|E

25|$|In some {{instances}} growers’ demand for beehives far exceeds the <b>available</b> <b>supply.</b> The number of managed beehives in the US has steadily declined from close to 6 million after WWII, {{to less than}} 2.5 million today. In contrast, the area dedicated to growing bee-pollinated crops has grown over 300% {{in the same time}} period. Additionally, {{in the past five years}} there has been a decline in winter managed beehives, which has reached an unprecedented rate of colony losses at near 30%. At present, there is an enormous demand for beehive rentals that cannot always be met. There is a clear need across the agricultural industry for a management tool to draw pollinators into cultivations and encourage them to preferentially visit and pollinate the flowering crop. By attracting pollinators like honey bees and increasing their foraging behavior, particularly in the center of large plots, we can increase grower returns and optimize yield from their plantings. ISCA Technologies, from Riverside California, created a semiochemical formulation called SPLAT Bloom, that modifies the behavior of honey bees, inciting them to visit flowers in every portion of the field.|$|E

500|$|Agricultural {{and urban}} growth in Arizona {{eventually}} outstripped {{the capacity of}} local rivers; these concerns were reflected {{in the creation of}} a Pacific Southwest Water Plan in the 1950s, which aimed to build a project that would permit Arizona to fully utilize its [...] allotment of the river. The Pacific Southwest Water Plan was the first major proposal to divert water to the Colorado Basin from other river basins – namely, from the wetter northwestern United States. It was intended to boost supplies for the Lower Basin states of Arizona, California and Nevada as well as Mexico, thus allowing the Upper Basin states to retain native Colorado River flows for their own use. Although there was still a surplus of water in the Colorado Basin during the mid-20th century, the Bureau of Reclamation predicted, correctly, that eventually population growth would outstrip the <b>available</b> <b>supply</b> and require the transfer of water from other sources.|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Carol Case and Hawley {{worked closely}} together to develop Fargo costumes. Case saw {{the show as}} a big undertaking because of her desire to capture the [...] "specific feeling" [...] of 1970s fashion. Starting [...] "from scratch", the design team sought to create a [...] "really small-town America" [...] style {{for most of the}} show's wardrobe. They also felt {{that it was important to}} distinguish the style of the rural characters, who at that time were largely unaware of fashion trends, from that of the urban characters. For the urban characters, Case used clothes she bought from New York to create a more polished, sleek look. Though Fargo producers bought a few pieces months in advance of production, sourcing vintage wear proved to be daunting, especially for cold weather, since much of the <b>available</b> <b>supply</b> was inadequately insulated. As a consequence, many costumes, such as Dunst's, were either modified by adding insulation, or created anew by the design team. Some modern pieces were used for footwear and accessories.|$|E

[...] Sources which have no direct waste products (such as wind, solar, and hydropower) are brought up on this point. With global demand for energy growing, the need to adopt various energy sources is growing. Energy conservation is an alternative or complementary process to energy development.
