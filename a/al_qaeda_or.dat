2500|$|Obama {{expanded}} the drone strike program begun by the Bush administration, and the Obama administration conducted drone strikes against targets in Yemen, Somalia, and, most prominently, Pakistan. Though the drone strikes killed high-ranking terrorists, {{they were also}} criticized for resulting in civilian casualties. A 2013 Pew research poll showed that the strikes were broadly unpopular in Pakistan, and some {{former members of the}} Obama administration have criticized the strikes for causing a backlash against the United States. However, based on 147 interviews conducted in 2015, professor Aqil Shah argued that the strikes were popular in North Waziristan, the area in which most of the strikes take place, and that little blowback occurred. In 2009, the UN special investigator on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions called the United States' reliance on drones [...] "increasingly common" [...] and [...] "deeply troubling", and called on the U.S. to justify its use of targeted assassinations rather than attempting to capture <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>or</b> Taliban suspects. In 2013, Obama appointed John Brennan as the new CIA Director and announced a new policy that required CIA operatives to determine with a [...] "near-certainty" [...] that no civilians would be hurt in a drone strike. The number of drone strikes fell substantially after the announcement of the new policy, ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 12, 2012, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest {{granted the}} plaintiffs' motion for a {{permanent}} injunction of § 1021(b)(2) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 in a 112-page opinion. The permanent injunction issued by Judge Forrest barred the government from relying on the defense authorization law to hold people in indefinite military detention on suspicion that they [...] "substantially supported" [...] <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>or</b> its allies — at least if they had no connection to the September 11 attacks. Forrest held that the law's definitions of [...] "substantially supported" [...] and [...] "associated forces" [...] were unconstitutionally vague in that a reporter or activist {{could not be sure}} they would not be covered under the provision if they worked with a group deemed to be associated with terrorists, or perhaps circulated the message of an associated individual by printing an interview. Forrest acknowledged the importance of the government's efforts to safeguard the country from terrorism, but ruled that the law's broad language violated First Amendment right to free speech, as well as the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment right to due process that holds that a person must be able to understand what actions would subject them to penalties.|$|E
2500|$|In a December 2005 {{article in}} The New York Times, it was {{revealed}} that the National Security Agency (NSA) was eavesdropping on U.S. citizens without warrants in cases where (i) NSA intelligence agents had reason to believe at least one party to the call was a member of <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>or</b> a group affiliated with al Qaeda, and (ii) the call was international. [...] The New York Times acknowledged that the activities had been classified, and that it had disclosed the activities over the Administration's objections. As such, Attorney General Gonzales threatened The Times with prosecution under the Espionage Act of 1917, since knowing publication of classified information is a federal crime. [...] Gonzales raised the possibility that New York Times journalists could be prosecuted for publishing classified information based on the outcome of the criminal investigation underway into leaks to the Times of data about the National Security Agency's surveillance of terrorist-related calls between the United States and abroad. He said, [...] "I understand very much the role that the press plays in our society, the protection under the First Amendment we want to protect and respect..." [...] As for the Times, he said, [...] "As we do in every case, it's a case-by-case evaluation about what the evidence shows us, our interpretation of the law. [...] We have an obligation to enforce the law and to prosecute those who engage in criminal activity." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a letter}} to the Senate dated August 1, 2007, Gonzales {{disclosed}} that shortly after the September 11 attacks, the President authorized the NSA, under a single Presidential Authorization, to engage in a number of intelligence activities, which would later be collectively described as the [...] "President's Surveillance Program" [...] (PSP) by the DOJ Inspector General, Glenn A. Fine. [...] Some of these authorized activities were described as the [...] "Terrorist Surveillance Program" [...] (TSP) by President Bush, in an address to the nation on December 16, 2005. As the August 1 letter indicates the dispute between the President and James Comey that led to the hospital visit was not over TSP, it concerned other classified intelligence activities that are part of PSP and have not been disclosed. He defended his authorization of the program, asserting [...] "... if you are talking with al Qaeda, we want to know why." [...] In his letter, Gonzales wrote the Senate Judiciary Committee that he defined TSP as the program the President publicly confirmed, a program that targets communications where one party is outside the United States, and as to which the government had reason to believe at least one party to the communication is a member of <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>or</b> an affiliated terrorist organization. [...] Indeed, prior to the 2007 letter, Gonzales provided the same definition of TSP in several public appearances leading up to a hearing in Congress on February 6, 2006.|$|E

2500|$|The Senate {{supported}} a resolution saying, [...] "the violence in Benghazi coincided with {{an attack on}} the United States Embassy in Cairo, Egypt, which was also swarmed by an angry mob of protesters on September 11, 2012", and making no mention of Al Qaeda. During a house hearing on May 8, 2013, an email, which was never classified, that was sent on September 12, 2012, to Susan Rice as well as many other members of the State Department, was read aloud by Representative Trey Gowdy (R). The email stated clearly that the attacks were committed by Islamists, with no mention of an [...] "angry mob" [...] or protestors. Gowdy said the Obama administration was [...] "changing names" [...] and [...] "creating aliases" [...] of Benghazi survivors and [...] "dispersing them around the country" [...] {{to keep them out of}} sight. According to The New York Times, both protesters angered by an anti-Muslim video and Islamic militants were involved, but no links to <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>or</b> other officially known terrorist groups were found. It said, [...] "Anger at the video motivated the initial attack." [...] Khattala, an alleged terrorist who was captured for his role in directing attackers, said “From a religious point of view, it is hard to say whether it is good or bad." [...] On December 13, 2012, in a letter to President Barack Obama, Rice asked him to remove her name from consideration for Secretary of State.|$|E
