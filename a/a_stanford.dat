5|$|While still <b>an</b> undergraduate, <b>Stanford</b> was {{appointed}} organist of Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1882, aged 29, {{he was one}} of the founding professors of the Royal College of Music, where he taught composition for the rest of his life. From 1887 he was also Professor of Music at Cambridge. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> teacher, <b>Stanford</b> was sceptical about modernism, and based his instruction chiefly on classical principles as exemplified in the music of Brahms. Among his pupils were rising composers whose fame went on to surpass his own, such as Gustav Holst and Ralph Vaughan Williams. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> conductor, <b>Stanford</b> held posts with the Bach Choir and the Leeds triennial music festival.|$|R

5|$|Stanford's {{offense was}} {{commanded}} by redshirt sophomore quarterback Andrew Luck, who completed 70 {{percent of his}} pass attempts, gaining 3,051yards, 28touchdowns, and 7interceptions. The touchdown mark was <b>a</b> <b>Stanford</b> single-season record. He also gained 438yards running the ball, setting <b>a</b> <b>Stanford</b> record for rushing by a quarterback, and his combined rushing and passing total set a record at Stanford for total offense. On December 13, Luck {{finished second in the}} voting for the Heisman Trophy, the annual award given to the best player in college football that season. NCAA rules allow a player three years removed from high school to enter the NFL Draft, and even though he was only a sophomore in 2010, he met the three-year standard {{at the conclusion of the}} season. Before the Orange Bowl, media and fans speculated as to Luck's likely choice.|$|E

25|$|Many Stanford {{players and}} coaches objected {{immediately}} to the third lateral, from Dwight Garner to Richard Rodgers, asserting that Garner's knee was down moments beforehand. Kevin Lamar, <b>a</b> <b>Stanford</b> player who was in on the tackle, maintains that Garner's knee had hit the turf {{while he was still}} in possession of the ball; Garner and Rodgers themselves, however, assert the opposite. TV replays were inconclusive; due to the distance from the camera and the swarm of tacklers, one cannot see the exact moment Garner's knee may have touched.|$|E

Wiggins would go on to score 25 points in the game and would be named the Women's Basketball Coaches Association {{national}} player of the year.
