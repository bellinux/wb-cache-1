The scope of offered services may include facilities to conduct bank transactions, to <b>administer</b> <b>accounts</b> and to access customized information. After the launch of mobile banking in India, mobile banking transactions have seen some growth. Still mobile banking {{has a long way to}} go as, majority of customers prefer banking in traditional ways. The basic objective is to identify the advantages and limitations of mobile banking and the problems faced by customers in mobile banking. The banking sector reforms and introduction of e-banking has made very structural changes in service quality, managerial decisions, operational performance, profitability and productivity of the banks. There are various factors which have played vital role in the Indian banking sector for adoption of technology. So in order to run the mobile banking effectively, proper care has been taken care of and take adequate steps to improve the quality services...|$|R

5000|$|In his {{critique}} of political economy, Marx denied {{that any of these}} assumptions were scientifically true (see further real prices and ideal prices).

However he did not analyze all the different forms that prices can take (for example, market-driven prices, <b>administered</b> prices, <b>accounting</b> prices, negotiated and fixed prices, estimated prices, nominal prices, or inflation-adjusted prices) focusing mainly on the value proportions he thought to be central to the functioning of the capitalist mode of production as a social system. The effect of this omission was that debates about the relevance of Marx's value theory became confused, and that Marxists repeated the same ideas Marx himself had rejected as [...] "vulgar economics".

40|$|Introduction. Frasier {{syndrome}} (FS) is {{a genetic}} form of glomerulopathy, which results from mutations in the Wilms’ {{tumour suppressor gene}} (WT 1). Proteinuria in FS has been traditionally considered unresponsive to any medication and FS inevitably progresses to end stage renal failure. Case Outline. We present a patient with FS who had atypical clinical manifestation and unusual beneficial antiproteinuric response to renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors given in combination with indomethacin. After 13 years of follow-up, the patient is now 17 -year old with normal renal functions and no proteinuria. Conclusion. RAS inhibitors combined with indomethacin showed beneficial effect in our patient. Thus, this combination might be the initial treatment of patients with FS. If this treatment strategy was not satisfied for at least 3 months, then CsA would {{be considered to be}} <b>administered</b> taking <b>account</b> of the nephrotoxicity and the increased risk of malignancy. Further prospective study is required to clarify this issue. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. OI 175079...|$|R

We also found {{no significant difference in the}} power of the two question types to discriminate—both types appeared equally competent in differentiating between low- and high-performing students. Although accounting professors may wish to use MC questions with excess information for a number of other reasons, we found that MCE questions, as used in the present setting, do not appear to better discriminate student understanding relative to non-MCE questions...|$|R

40|$|Employing {{knowledge}} lens, {{this study}} empirically identifies and examines {{the impact of}} potential drivers of innovative accounting practices in a disruptive economy. The research model employed {{in the study was}} derived from the systematic integration of past empirical frameworks and findings. Data was collected using questionnaire survey which was self <b>administered</b> to <b>accounting</b> officers in a public university in Malaysia. A total of 53 usable questionnaires were collected out of 80 that were administered. The data was preliminary screened before performing the main analysis. Partial least square structural equation modelling was employed in validating the hypotheses. The findings provide evidence that accounting technologies, competent accounting staff and continuous accounting knowledge creation are potential enablers for disruptive innovative accounting practices. The research provide insight into the relevance of utilizing accounting knowledge technologies in fostering knowledge creation and innovative accounting practices. This paper {{is one of the first}} to empirically support the roles of accounting knowledge culture and accounting knowledge creation as accounting response strategy to disruptive innovations.

5000|$|Attorneys {{routinely}} receive client funds (commonly {{referred to}} as [...] "trust money") {{to be held in}} trust for future use. If the amount is large or the funds are to be held {{for a long period of}} time, the attorney customarily places these funds in an interest-bearing account for the benefit of the client. However, in the case of amounts that are small or are to be held for a short time, it is impractical for the attorney to establish a separate account for each client since the cost of establishing and <b>administering</b> the <b>account</b> would exceed any interest generated, and result in a net loss for the client. Prior to IOLTA, these nominal and short-term funds were combined and placed into a pooled, non-interest-bearing checking account. The reason the accounts were non-interest-bearing is because prior to 1981, commercial banks were prohibited by federal law from paying interest on demand deposits (e.g. checking accounts). In addition, the lawyer could not earn interest on the account because it is unethical for attorneys to derive any financial benefit from funds that belong to their clients.|$|R
