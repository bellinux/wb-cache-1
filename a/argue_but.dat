5|$|As {{the pair}} leave separately, Mařenka's parents, Ludmila and Krušina, enter with the {{marriage}} broker Kecal. After some discussion, Kecal announces {{that he has}} found a groom for Mařenka – Vašek, younger son of Tobiáš Mícha, a wealthy landowner; the older son, he explains, is a worthless good-for-nothing. Kecal extols the virtues of Vašek ("He's a nice boy, well brought up"), as Mařenka re-enters. In the subsequent quartet she responds by saying that she already has a chosen lover. Send him packing, orders Kecal. The four <b>argue,</b> <b>but</b> little is resolved. Kecal decides he must convince Jeník to give up Mařenka, as the villagers return, singing and dancing a festive polka.|$|E
5|$|Kristina (Monica Potter) is {{teaching}} Haddie (Sarah Ramos) how to drive, but is so over-worried she stresses her daughter out. Haddies tries to convince Adam {{to teach her}} instead, but he refuses. Later, during another lesson, Kristina distresses Haddie so much she crashes into a garbage can, damaging a side mirror. The two later <b>argue,</b> <b>but</b> they eventually reconcile, and Kristina explains she dreads the idea of her daughter dying in an accident. Meanwhile, Crosby (Dax Shepard) meets and seems attracted to Gaby (Minka Kelly), the therapist helping Max (Max Burkholder). Crosby is {{trying to cope with}} missing his son Jabbar (Tyree Brown) and girlfriend Jasmine (Joy Bryant), who is in New York City pursuing her dancing career. Jabbar plans to visit Crosby, who promises Max the two boys can have a sleepover, much to Max's excitement. However, Jasmine later tells Crosby she cannot visit after all due to an audition. When Crosby tells Max, he grows hysterical due to his Asperger syndrome. He is calmed by Gaby while Crosby watches, realizing the extent of Max's problems. Haddie later has a sleepover with a now-happy Max.|$|E
5|$|Months earlier, before Ellie meets Joel, Ellie's friend Riley (Yaani King) surprises Ellie {{at their}} {{boarding}} school after weeks away. She reveals {{that she has}} joined the Fireflies, a revolutionary militia group, and takes Ellie to explore an abandoned shopping mall. Riley reveals {{that she has been}} assigned to a group of Fireflies in a different city, and broke the rules to see Ellie again. The girls <b>argue,</b> <b>but</b> Ellie eventually tells her that she supports her decision as it is something that Riley has wanted for a long time. Before parting, Riley plugs Ellie's walkman into the sound system and dances with her. Ellie tearfully begs Riley not to leave. Riley rips her dog tags off and Ellie kisses her. Drawn by the noise, the Infected pursue Ellie and Riley; they run, but are bitten. They consider suicide, but choose to spend their final hours together.|$|E

5|$|Susan {{suspects}} Karl {{is having}} an affair with Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita), but is disappointed to learn that it was Malcolm. Karl and Susan get stuck in a storage shed and they reminisce about their past. They share a kiss goodbye and Susan goes to stay with Toadie and Sonya. Susan notices Audrey is not herself and she and Karl learn Audrey is dying. They care for her before she is put to sleep. When Karl goes to bury Audrey in the garden, Susan stops him and says she wants Audrey to be buried somewhere that she can visit often. They <b>argue,</b> <b>but</b> put aside their differences when Audrey's body, which was placed in an esky, is collected by a hard rubbish collector. Karl rescues the esky and he and Susan bury Audrey at Sonya's nursery. Susan soon finds an apartment to move into. Susan accompanies Karl to the funeral of an old friend and they share a drink together. Paul asks Susan to write a negative article about Ajay Kapoor (Sachin Joab) and the community centre plans, but she refuses. She later discovers Paul sabotaged Natasha Williams's (Valentina Novakovic) party by inviting gatecrashers to it, so he could continue his vendetta against Ajay and the police station merger. Susan tells Paul to publish a retraction or she will write an exposé.|$|E

They fall asleep after making love.|$|E
25|$|Carroll {{sees this}} {{societal}} belief as vital {{in interpreting the}} final scene of the play, arguing that Valentine does give Silvia to Proteus, and in so doing, he is merely acting {{in accordance with the}} practices of the day. However, if one accepts that Valentine does not give Silvia to Proteus, as critics such as Jeffrey Masten <b>argue,</b> <b>but</b> instead offers to love Proteus as much as he loves Silvia, then the conclusion of the play can be read as a final triumphant reconciliation between friendship and love; Valentine intends to love his friend as much as he does his betrothed. Love and friendship are shown to be co-existent, not exclusive.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Lefroy is a {{promising}} lawyer {{with a bad}} reputation, which he describes as [...] "typical" [...] {{for people in the}} profession. Tom makes a terrible first impression upon meeting Jane, when he nearly falls asleep while she gives a reading of her work for the company. Overhearing his subsequent criticism, Jane cannot stand the arrogant Irishman. Meanwhile, she turns down the affections of other men, including Mr. Wisley, the nephew and heir of the wealthy Lady Gresham. Wisley proposes but Jane ultimately rejects him due to lack of affection. The mischievous Tom encounters Jane again; they <b>argue</b> <b>but</b> increasingly take interest in each other and Tom demonstrates that he takes Jane's literary aspirations seriously. In time they fall in love.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the play}} is {{concerned}} with demonstrating the immensity of the difficulties that face Jason in trying to rescue Number 18. For example, he finds it difficult {{to be away from}} his wife, and struggles with the decision of whether to continue his work or return to Canada. To depict this tension, Jason and Ali communicate via Skype, represented on stage by two laptop computers placed back-to-back with Jason and Ali standing on either side facing one another. The two <b>argue,</b> <b>but</b> their interactions demonstrate the kind of love that Number 18 can only dream of. In the 2012 cross-Canada tour, a torn picture of Number 18's family remained on stage as scenery to emphasize what the character has lost. This picture took the form of a painted curtain held over a geometric floor pattern and depicted the family as tired, poor, and living in a shack. Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate said the most emotionally gripping scene was the one in which the voices cause Number 18 to recall the face of her dead father. [...] Anna Borowiecki of the St. Albert Gazette called the play a story of [...] "fallible people who find strength in each other under the worst conditions." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 1950, Jackie Gleason {{took over}} as the host of Cavalcade of Stars, a variety show that aired on the {{struggling}} DuMont Television Network. After the first year, he and his writers Harry Crane and Joe Bigelow developed a sketch that drew upon familiar domestic situations for its material. Based on the popular radio show The Bickersons, Gleason wanted a realistic portrayal of life for a poor husband and wife living in Brooklyn, his home borough. The couple would continually <b>argue,</b> <b>but</b> ultimately show their love for each other. After rejecting titles such as [...] "The Beast," [...] "The Lovers," [...] and [...] "The Couple Next Door," [...] Gleason and his staff settled on [...] "The Honeymooners." [...] Gleason took the role of Ralph Kramden, a blustery bus driver, and he chose veteran comedy movie actress Pert Kelton {{for the role of}} Alice Kramden, Ralph's [...] and long-suffering wife.|$|E
2500|$|Kyle Massey played Cory Baxter, Aged 10–13. Cory is Raven's {{younger brother}} who {{sometimes}} {{acts as the}} main antagonist of the series. He and Raven often <b>argue,</b> <b>but</b> in the long run, they care deeply for each other. Even as he gets older, he claims that playing pranks on Raven {{is one of his}} guilty pleasures. Cory has two best friends, William and Larry. Together, the 3 boys form the band Cory and the Boys, with Cory as the drummer and lead singer, while Larry is the guitarist. William starts out playing the clarinet, and then plays the keyboard. The band has one song: [...] "Feelin' the Love". Cory is an aspiring businessman. He is shown to be obsessed with money, and often creates [...] "get-rich-quick" [...] schemes behind his parents' backs, in which he always gets into trouble. Cory also has a close relationship with his pet rat, Lionel. Earlier in the series, he had a crush on Chelsea. In the third season starts an relationship with Cindy. His catchphrases is [...] "Cha-ching" [...] and [...] "You Know How I Do!". He and Victor are the main characters in the spin-off series Cory in the House.

2500|$|In {{the series}} premiere, [...] "Give Me a Ring Sometime" [...] (1982), Diane Chambers, a college student, enters Cheers and meets Sam Malone, a {{recovering}} alcoholic and a womanizer. While {{she waits for}} her fiancé Sumner Sloan (Michael McGuire), Diane realizes that Sumner has left her, and that she is jobless and penniless with nothing else in her life. Sam offers Diane {{a job as a}} cocktail waitress, and she accepts. In the next episode, [...] "Sam's Women" [...] (1982), Diane snootily teases Sam for preferring just beautiful women with below average intelligence. In response, Sam involves his ex-wife, Debra (Donna McKechnie), in a pretend relationship to prove Diane wrong. (In some syndicated prints, Sam's past marriage is omitted.) When Sam and Debra are leaving [...] "for" [...] an opera, Diane retrieves the opera pamphlet from Debra only to find it two years old, foiling Sam's scheme. Sam blames Diane for making his romantic life less fun anymore, and Diane assures that he would never win an intelligent woman. They <b>argue</b> <b>but</b> then make up. When Sam explains a color of the sky at a ski resort and compares it to Diane's eyes in vivid detail, apparently distracted Diane is nearly touched but then averts herself and treats it as repulsive to an intelligent woman. Throughout the season, Sam and Diane are attracted to each other and trade each other flirts and innuendos, but they never consummate their relationship. In the two-part season finale, [...] "Showdown" [...] (1983), Diane briefly dates Sam's successful, handsome, well-educated brother Derek, making Sam jealous. No longer able to suppress their feelings, Sam and Diane kiss passionately in the bar's office.|$|E
