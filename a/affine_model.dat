40|$|Most <b>affine</b> <b>models</b> of {{the term}} {{structure}} with stochastic volatility predict that the variance of the short rate should play a 'dual role' in that it should also equal a linear combination of yields. However, we find that estimation of a standard <b>affine</b> three-factor <b>model</b> results in a variance state variable that, while instrumental in explaining {{the shape of the}} yield curve, is essentially unrelated to GARCH estimates of the quadratic variation of the spot rate process or to implied variances from options. We then investigate four-factor <b>affine</b> <b>models.</b> Of the models tested, only the model that exhibits 'unspanned stochastic volatility' (USV) generates both realistic short rate volatility estimates and a good cross-sectional fit. Our findings suggest that short rate volatility cannot be extracted from the cross-section of bond prices. In particular, short rate volatility and convexity are only weakly correlated.

40|$|The Rational Function Model (RFM) is {{a widely}} used generic sensor model for {{georeferencing}} satellite images. Owing to inaccurate measurement of satellite orbit and attitude, the Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs) provided by image vendors are commonly biased and cannot be directly used for high-precision remote-sensing applications. In this paper, we propose a new method for the bias compensation of RPCs using local polynomial models (including the local <b>affine</b> <b>model</b> and the local quadratic model), which provides the ability to correct non-rigid RPC deformations. Performance of the proposed approach was evaluated using a stereo triplet of ZY- 3 satellite images and compared with conventional global-polynomial-based models (including the global <b>affine</b> <b>model</b> and the global quadratic model). The experimental results show that, when the same polynomial form was used, the correction residuals of the local model could be notably smaller {{than those of the}} global model, which indicates that the new method has great ability to remove complex errors existed in vendor-provided RPCs. In the experiments of this study, the accuracy of the local <b>affine</b> <b>model</b> was nearly 15 % better than that of the global <b>affine</b> <b>model.</b> Performance of the local quadratic model was not as good as the local <b>affine</b> <b>model</b> when the number of Ground Control Points (GCPs) was less than 10, but it improved rapidly with {{an increase in the number}} of redundant observations.

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{comprehensive}} empirical analysis of several generalized <b>affine</b> <b>models</b> with unspanned stochastic volatility and stochastic correlation. Unspanned stochastic volatility represents an {{important feature of}} the data generating process that volatility in bond prices cannot be spanned by bond prices alone. Stochastic correlation across different maturities is modeled as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck random field with Markov switching between two regimes. We compare these models along with the parsimonious string model with constant volatility and constant correlation in bond yields in terms their pricing interest rate caps. We find that the parsimonious string model with constant volatility and correlation of bond yields cannot price caps well. Stochastic volatility provides the most significant improvement in model performance and stochastic correlation is also important. The advantage of our implementation of the generalized <b>affine</b> <b>models</b> {{is that we do}} not sacrifice the important feature of the models- their infinite factor structure. It can be straightforwardly extended to incorporate multiple sources of volatility, different structure for stochastic correlation as well as jumps.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2006. Recent {{studies by}} Dai and Singleton (2002), Duffee (2002), and Duarte (2004) show that <b>affine</b> term {{structure}} <b>models</b> that match the time variability {{of the expected}} returns of bond yields do not generate time variation in the volatility of interest rates. This failure indicates that <b>affine</b> <b>models</b> fail to match one stylized fact of the term structure of U. S. interest rates. However, in this paper I show that the empirical limitation can be solved by allowing a more flexible specification of the risk-premia. I find that the <b>affine</b> <b>models</b> perform poorly at short forecasting horizons, but perform very well at longer horizons. Some <b>affine</b> <b>models</b> produce more accurate out-of-sample forecast than the random walk and other benchmark models. My empirical work also shows that the Kalman filter {{has the ability to}} filter discrepancy in zero-coupon bond yields occurring from different choices of splines, whereas the factor inversion method does not. When applied to different spline techniques, the factor inversion method gives larger differences in in-sample and out-of-sample bond yield forecasts than the Kalman filter method. Thus, I recommend estimating <b>affine</b> <b>models</b> by the Kalman filter rather than the factor inversion method. Lastly, I present an example of how the estimates of risk premia of GEA model can be used as an aid in duration decisions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} the spatio-temporal {{analysis}} of two-dimensional deformation and motion of cells from time series of digitized video images. A parametric motion approach based on an <b>affine</b> <b>model</b> has been proposed for the quantitative characterization of cellular movements in different experimental areas of cellular biology including spontaneous cell deformation, cell mitosis, individual cell migration and collective migration of cell populations as cell monolayer. The accuracy and robustness of the <b>affine</b> <b>model</b> parameter estimation, {{which is based on}} a multiresolution algorithm, has been established from synthesized image sequences. A major interest of our approach is to follow with time the evolution of a few number of parameters characteristic of cellular motion and deformation. From the time-varying eigenvalues of the <b>affine</b> <b>model</b> square matrix, a precise quantification of the cell pseudopodial activity, as well as of cell division has been performed. For migrating cells, the motion quantification confirms that cell body deformation has a leading role in controlling nucleus displacement, the nucleus itself undergoing a larger rotational motion. At the cell population level, image motion analysis of in vitro wound healing experiments quantifies the heterogeneous cell populations dynamics.

40|$|Korn and Koziol (2006) {{apply the}} Markowitz (1952) {{mean-variance}} framework to bond portfolio selection by proposing {{the use of}} term structure models to estimate the time-varying moments of bond returns. Duffee (2002) introduces a distinction between completely affine and essentially affine term structure models. A completely <b>affine</b> <b>model</b> uses a market price of risk specification that {{is proportional to the}} volatility of the risk factors. However, this assumption of proportionality of the market price of risk contradicts the observed behaviour of bond returns. In response, Duffee (2002) introduces a more flexible essentially affine market price of risk specification by breaking the strict proportionality of the completely affine specification. Essentially affine models better represent the empirical features of bond returns whilst preserving the tractability of completely affine models. However, Duffee and Stanton (2012) find that the increased flexibility of the essentially <b>affine</b> <b>model</b> comes at the expense of real-world parameter estimation. Given these parameter estimation issues, this dissertation investigates whether the difficulty in estimating an essentially affine specification is outweighed by the empirical preferability, and whether, all these issues considered, the Markowitz (1952) approach to bond portfolio optimisation is robust. The results indicate that the superior capability of an essentially <b>affine</b> <b>model</b> to forecast expected returns outweighs real-world parameter estimation issues; and that the estimation and mean-variance optimisation procedures are worthwhile...|$|E
