Assume that initially, {{the body in the}} static orbit starts out <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> to the radius with speed V. The body in the revolving orbit must also start <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> and assume its speed is v. In the case shown in Fig. 1., v > V and the force is directed towards S. The argument applies equally if v < V. Also, the force may be directed away from the centre.|$|E

The fibers of the outward-facing cell layer generally run <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> to the fibers of the inward-facing one.

5|$|Even {{following}} the conversion to cylindrical smokeboxes, {{it was still}} possible to distinguish some non-streamliners from ex-streamliners. On the former (Nos. 46230-46234 and 46249-46252, but not 46253-46257) the running plates veered downwards <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> {{to connect with the}} buffer beam {{in the style of the}} Princess Royal Class.

5|$|Since then, many {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} measuring such dragging coefficients, often {{in combination with the}} Sagnac effect. For instance, in experiments using ring lasers together with rotating disks, or in neutron interferometric experiments. Also a transverse dragging effect was observed, i.e. when the medium is moving <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> to the direction of the incident light.|$|E
5|$|If {{a person}} spots a nearby tornado while driving, the {{official}} National Weather Service directive {{has been for}} the individual to abandon the car and seek shelter in a ditch or culvert, or substantial shelter if nearby. Far-away, highly visible tornadoes, however, can be successfully fled from <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> (90-degrees) from its direction of apparent movement. Despite dangers inherent with operating a vehicle during a tornado, given sufficient advance warning, mobile home residents have been instructed by the National Weather Service to drive to the nearest secure shelter during a warning.|$|E
5|$|Oscarsson in {{the late}} 1970s {{proposed}} that these cortical zones can be partitioned into smaller units called microzones. A microzone {{is defined as a}} group of Purkinje cells all having the same somatotopic receptive field. Microzones were found to contain on the order of 1000 Purkinje cells each, arranged in a long, narrow strip, oriented perpendicular to the cortical folds. Thus, as the adjoining diagram illustrates, Purkinje cell dendrites are flattened {{in the same direction as}} the microzones extend, while parallel fibers cross them <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Austrians briefly {{took the}} {{advantage}} {{when they moved}} a battery from the ridge north of the village to cover their infantry; the fire from the battery allowed the infantry to deploy <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> to their original front. Frederick responded by ordering {{the last of his}} reserved left wing to advance, but the Austrian battery drove it back. Finally, Frederick's heavy cannons on the Butterberg, a small knoll to the west of town, laid down a barrage. Some participants said it was this barrage, more than the Prussian infantry, which won the battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner ear}} sits within the {{temporal}} bone in a complex cavity called the bony labyrinth. A central area known as the vestibule contains two small fluid-filled recesses, the utricle and saccule. These connect to the semicircular canals and the cochlea. There are three semicircular canals angled <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> to each other which are responsible for dynamic balance. The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing. These structures together create the membranous labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|When {{movement}} is required, one {{strategy is to}} minimise the motion signal, for example by avoiding waving limbs about and by choosing patterns that do not cause flicker when seen by the prey from straight ahead. Cuttlefish may be doing this with their active camouflage by choosing to form stripes <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> to their front-back axis, minimising motion signals that would be given by occluding and displaying the pattern as they swim.|$|E

5|$|Dynamic {{balance is}} {{provided}} through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (<b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles)</b> to each other. At {{the end of}} each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{potential}} is a scalar quantity, that is, {{it has only}} magnitude and not direction. It {{may be viewed as}} analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles.</b> They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{the corner}} houses, {{the houses were}} built in pairs, each sharing a porch with its neighbour. For many of the smaller fourth- and fifth-class houses, the doors were aligned <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> to the façade of the house, {{so as not to}} open {{directly}} adjacently to their neighbours. All houses were designed with at least one parlour and with the kitchen, scullery, and toilet in separate rooms {{at the rear of the}} house; the first-class houses also had toilets upstairs. In line with the design principles of the time, the downstairs toilets were accessible only from the back gardens, and the houses were not fitted with separate bathrooms; baths were taken in a moveable bath located in the kitchen.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} moduli {{space of the}} D 0 -brane system on Dp-branes {{realized}} in the noncommutative super-Yang–Mills theory. By examining the fluctuations around the solitonic solutions generated by solution generating technique, we confirm {{the interpretation of the}} moduli as the positions of D 0 -branes on Dp-branes. Low-energy scattering process is also examined for two D 0 -branes. We find that the D 0 -branes scatter <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> for head-on collision in the D 0 –D 4 system. For D 0 –D 6 and D 0 –D 8 systems we find special solutions which reduce to the D 0 –D 4 case, giving the same behavior. This suggests that the scattering <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> for head-on collision is a universal behavior of this kind of soliton scatterings...|$|R
5|$|The Clifton and Cotham areas provide {{examples}} of the developments from the Georgian to the Regency style, with many fine terraces and villas facing the road, and <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> to it. In the early 19th century, the romantic medieval gothic style appeared, partially as a backlash to the symmetry of Palladianism, and {{can be seen in}} buildings such as Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery, Royal West of England Academy, and The Victoria Rooms. St Mary on the Quay church was built between 1839 and 1843, by Richard Shackleton Pope, as a Catholic apostolic chapel for the Irvingite congregation: it is now a Roman Catholic church.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebellar}} cortex {{is divided into}} three layers. At the bottom lies the thick granular layer, densely packed with granule cells, along with interneurons, mainly Golgi cells but also including Lugaro cells and unipolar brush cells. In the middle lies the Purkinje layer, a narrow zone that contains the cell bodies of Purkinje cells and Bergmann glial cells. At the top lies the molecular layer, which contains the flattened dendritic trees of Purkinje cells, along with the huge array of parallel fibers penetrating the Purkinje cell dendritic trees <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles.</b> This outermost layer of the {{cerebellar cortex}} also contains two types of inhibitory interneuron: stellate cells and basket cells. Both stellate and basket cells form GABAergic synapses onto Purkinje cell dendrites.|$|E
