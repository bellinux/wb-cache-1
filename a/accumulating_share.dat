40|$|This paper {{studies the}} trading {{behavior}} of smart traders (statistical arbitrageurs) when other market participants act predictably. We examine {{a group of}} traders who profit by <b>accumulating</b> <b>shares</b> during days stocks hit their upper price limits. The traders then sell out quickly the next day for an average overnight return of 0. 80 % after transaction costs. We stress this {{is not simply a}} momentum trading strategy; neither daily nor overnight momentum are large factors in this market. The magnitude of observed profits cannot be explained by a liquidity premium nor does it appear to be compensation for increased risk. Our findings are consistent with recent behavioral theories regarding attention-grabbing stocks. We find attention-based buying by unsophisticated individual investors fuels the smart trader profits. There is a transitory impact on prices with reversion to pre-event levels within ten trading days.

Responding to such pandemics requires careful planning for the early phases where there is no availability of pandemic vaccine. We set out to compute a Neighborhood Influenza Susceptibility Index (NISI) describing the vulnerability of local communities of different geo-socio-physical structure to a pandemic influenza outbreak. We used a spatially explicit geo-physical model of Linköping municipality (pop. 136, 240) in Sweden, and employed an ontology-modeling tool to define simulation models and transmission settings. We found considerable differences in NISI between neighborhoods corresponding to primary care areas with regard to early progress of the outbreak, as well as in terms of the total <b>accumulated</b> <b>share</b> of infected residents counted after the outbreak. The NISI can be used in local preparations of physical response measures during pandemics...|$|R

40|$|Every day, {{millions}} of rural people {{who depend on}} agriculture confront technical, economic, social, cultural, and traditional obstacles to improving their livelihoods. To cope with these obstacles, the rural poor draw on indigenous knowledge and innovate through local experimentation and adaptation. Indigenous knowledge alone, however, {{is not enough to}} deal with the complex problems facing the agricultural sector. Emerging issues such as high food prices, climate change, and demands for biofuels require complementary knowledge from formal agricultural research and development (R&D) and support from policies and other institutions. Formal and informal knowledge and innovation must therefore be linked to accelerate sustainable agricultural development. Knowledge, defined as organized or processed information or data, is fundamental in the pursuit of innovation. For innovation to occur, knowledge must be created, <b>accumulated,</b> <b>shared,</b> and used. Innovations—new ideas, practices, or products that are successfully introduced into economic or social processes— can involve technologies, organizations, institutions, or policies. Innovation means putting ideas, knowledge, and technology to work in a manner that brings about a significant improvement in performance or product quality.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} daily institutional investors trading patterns {{before and after}} public news announcements in the US equity market, such as Merger and Acquisition announcement and release of macroeconomic indicators. Do institutional investors have inside information, or do they have superior models before news announcement? Using a high frequency institutional trading dataset that combines intraday NYSE Trades and Quotes (TAQ) data with the quarterly institutional ownership report (13 F) by a reduced-form model, this dissertation tests the hypothesis of institutional investors trading on inside information 1993 to 2004. I find that most institutional investors are informed traders who <b>accumulate</b> <b>shares</b> before good news or before takeover announcements as early as 30 days ahead. Institutional investors do not have superior models in that they only buy the actual future targets and sell the forecasted ?rumor? stocks from an acquisition probability model. By reversing their positions on and after the announcement day, they realize positive profits. Further, I confirm that the pre-event trading pattern of institutional investors is associated with stocks that have high probability of informed trading...|$|R

40|$|General outline: Typology has {{provided}} architects basic design {{resources in the}} past. Repertories have been created by comparing and establishing relations among a multiplicity of examples: these repertories {{have been used as}} the basis for new inventions. Research on type establishes the foundations for organized knowledge that can be <b>accumulated,</b> <b>shared,</b> and enriched by successive designs. We are testing our assumption that CAD is a specially adequate tool for the transformation and manipulation of type {{in the early stages of}} the design process. Goals: Our Seminar/Studio gives those who take part in it a renewed vision of type as a basic disposition that can be subject to dynamic transformations. The use of CAD will allow the participants to experiment and verify design decisions on the grounds of a systematic use of typological precedents. Methodology: Starting with definite examples of contemporary architecture and the design theory backing the examples selected, the seminar/ studio is developed in eight studio sessions, exploring different dimensions leading to the “parti”. It is meant for experienced designers, both advanced students and graduates. The first experimental seminar of two sessions took place in November 1999.

Design/methodology/approach – Semi-structured interviews with the two participants were conducted; and the interview material was transcribed and analyzed. Findings – Global knowledge work is a multifaceted concept; it can exist in different fields, including art, technology and social sciences. Global knowledge work is about knowledge that is acquired, <b>accumulated,</b> <b>shared</b> and enriched through relocation, travel or integration into networks. Global knowledge workers are equipped with some form of specialized knowledge, skills set and different communication strategies. Their motivation varies from intellectual curiosity, financial and career benefits, personal reasons to seek a life in another country to the prestige of global knowledge work. Practical implications – Diversity is a defining attribute of global knowledge work. Diverse backgrounds, expertise and viewpoints of global knowledge workers are becoming an increasingly significant asset for organizations. This has implications in terms of developing effective diversity management strategies in global and knowledge-intensive organizations, such as universities. Originality/value – The paper draws on two interviews with practising global knowledge workers, {{in the fields of}} art and economy.
