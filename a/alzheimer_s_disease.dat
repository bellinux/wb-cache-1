40|$|Background: To date, {{clinical}} trials have reported inconsistent {{results on the}} efficacy of the combination therapy of Memantine plus an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) over a single-drug therapy in the treatment of <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> This meta-analysis aim is to assess {{the efficacy of the}} combination therapy of Memantine plus an AChEI in the treatment of <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> compared with a single-drug therapy using an AChEI. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases were searched through December 2013. Seven randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. A random-effects meta-analysis was used. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. Results: A combination therapy of an AChEI with memantine was associated with modestly better effects in terms of cognition and global function compared to a monotherapy with an AChEI. The effects of the combination therapy were no better than a monotherapy for daily living activity. However, the combination therapy showed benefits over a monotherapy for the behavioral outcome and the effect was independent of the stage of the disease. Moreover, the rate of adverse effects did not differ between a combination therapy and a single therapy. Conclusions: The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that the combination therapy is more appropriate and should be administered for patients in more advanced stages. However, not all patients may benefit from the combination treatment. Identification of subgroups of patients with <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> who will benefit more from the combination treatment is needed...|$|E
40|$|Phosphoinositides are {{important}} components of eukaryotic membranes {{that are required}} for multiple forms of membrane dynamics. Phosphoinositides are involved in defining membrane identity, mediate cell signalling and control membrane trafficking events. Due to their pivotal role in membrane dynamics, phosphoinositide de-regulation contributes to various human diseases. In this review, we {{will focus on the}} newly emerging regulation of the PIKfyve complex, a phosphoinositide kinase that converts the endosomal phosphatidylinositol- 3 -phosphate [PI(3) P] to phosphatidylinositol- 3, 5 -bisphosphate [PI(3, 5) P 2) ], a low abundance phosphoinositide of outstanding importance for neuronal integrity and function. Loss of PIKfyve function is well known to result in neurodegeneration in both mousemodels and human patients. Our recent work has surprisingly identified the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the central molecule in <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> aetiology, as a novel interaction partner of a subunit of the PIKfyve complex, Vac 14. Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} APP modulates PIKfyve function and PI(3, 5) P 2 dynamics, suggesting that the APP gene family functions as regulator of PI(3, 5) P 2 metabolism.

However, the balance between the synthesis, clearance, and assembly of misfolded proteins into neurotoxic aggregates remains poorly understood. Here we study the effects of modulating this balance for the amyloid-beta (Ab) peptide by using a small engineered binding protein (ZAb 3) that binds with nanomolar affinity to Ab, completely sequestering the aggregation-prone regions of the peptide and preventing its aggregation. Co-expression of ZAb 3 in the brains of Drosophila melanogaster expressing either Ab 42 or the aggressive familial <b>Alzheimer</b> 9 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (AD) associated E 22 G variant of Ab 42 abolishes their neurotoxic effects. Biochemical analysis indicates that monomer Ab binding results in degradation of the peptide in vivo. Complementary biophysical studies emphasize the dynamic nature of Ab aggregation and reveal that ZAb 3 not only inhibits the initial association of Ab monomers into oligomers or fibrils, but also dissociates pre-formed oligomeric aggregates and, although very slowly, amyloid fibrils. Toxic effects of peptide aggregation in vivo can therefore be eliminated by sequestration of hydrophobic regions in monomeric peptides, even when these are extremely aggregation prone.

Histological {{studies have shown that}} lesions are not uniformly distributed within {{the hippocampus}}. Moreover, alterations of different hippocampal layers may reflect distinct pathological processes. 7 T MRI dramatically improves the vi-sualization of hippocampal subregions and layers. In this study, we aimed to assess whether 7 T MRI can detect volumetric changes in hippocampal layers in vivo in patients with AD. We studied four AD patients and seven control subjects. MR images were acquired using a whole-body 7 T scanner with an eight channel transmit– receive coil. Hippocampal subregions were manually segmented from coronal T 2 *-weighted gradient echo images with 0. 3 × 0. 3 × 1. 2 mm 3 resolution using a protocol that distinguishes between layers richer or poorer in neuronal bodies. Five subregions were segmented in the region of the hippocampal body: alveus, strata radiatum, lacunosum and moleculare (SRLM) of the cornu Ammonis (CA), hilum, stratum pyramidale of CA and stratum pyramidale of the subiculum. We found strong bilateral reductions in the SRLM of the cornu Ammonis and in the stratum pyramidale of the subiculum (p b 0. 05), with average cross-sectional area reductions ranging from − 29 % to − 49 %.

Samples of pure phospholipids DMPC DMPS and samples with embedded amyloid b peptides have been compared. The peptide concentration was 3 mol for both amyloid b peptides. The sample temperature was set to 320 K, where the samples are in the liquid crystalline phase, which is the physiologically relevant phase of biological membranes. The data have been analyzed with a purely phenomenological model, which combines two different motions with different time constants. These two motions have been assigned to a long range translational diffusion and a spatially restricted localized diffusion. The different lengths of the peptides leads to different positions and orientations inside the membrane bilayers. Thus, different influences on the dynamics are also expected.

As SelR is highly expressed in brain and closely related to <b>Alzheimer</b> 9 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (AD), its biological functions in human brain become a research focus. In this paper, the selenocysteine-coding TGA of SelR gene was mutated to cysteine-coding TGC and used to screen the human fetal brain cDNA library with a yeast two-hybrid system. Our results demonstrated that SelR interacts with clusterin (Clu), a chaperone protein. This protein interaction was further verified by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP), and pull-down assays. The interacting domain of Clu was determined by co-IP to be a dynamic, molten globule structure spanning amino acids 315 to 381 with an amphipathic-helix. The interacting domain of SelR was investigated by gene manipulation, ligand replacement, protein over-expression, and enzyme activity measurement to be a tetrahedral complex consisting of a zinc ion binding with four Cys residues. Study on the mutual effect of SelR and Clu showed synergic property between the two proteins.

40|$|The {{zebrafish}} (Danio rerio), {{a tropical}} {{fresh water fish}} originally found in the rivers of India and Bangladesh has become a popular vertebrate model system over the last decade. The rapid sequencing of the zebrafish genome together with the latest advances in forward and reverse genetics has made this model organism more fascinating {{as it can be}} used to decipher the genetic mechanisms involved in the vertebrate development. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) regulates the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress. Alteration in the production of CRH can lead to Cushing s syndrome, anxiety-related disorders and other neurodegenerative disorders such as <b>Alzheimers</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> Parkinson <b>s</b> dementia and Huntington <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> In mammals it was reported that a POU class III gene by name Brn- 2 is essential for the development of specific neuroendocrine cell types. Brn- 2 can also regulate the transcription of corticotropinreleasing hormone by binding to its promoter. Corroborating the above fact, knockout studies in mice have shown that deletion of Brn- 2 affects the development of corticotropinreleasing hormone producing neurons in addition to oxytocin and vasopressin synthesizing neurons. In order to understand the genetic mechanisms involved in the development of zebrafish neuroendocrine hypothalamus, we attempted to characterize the developmental expression profile of brn 1. 2 and crh in zebrafish. Zebrafish crh gene has not been characterized before and only a partial sequence of brn 1. 2 was reported earlier. We screened the zebrafish EST database for brn 1. 2 and crh through a blast search and identified EST s for crh and brn 1. 2 that contained their full ORF. We used non-quantitative RT-PCR to analyze embryonic and post-embryonic expression pattern of crh. Expression of crh mRNA was detected from 1 dpf and it remained stable through 5 dpf. RT-PCR analysis of the tissues revealed strong expression of crh mRNA in the brain, eye, gills and weak expression in the testis. Spatial expression pattern of both the genes were analyzed by whole mount in situ hybridization. Expression of crh was detected in different parts of the embryonic brain including telencephalon, hypothalamus, posterior tuberculum, thalamus, preoptic area, epiphysis, midbrain tegmentum, hindbrain and in the retina. Localization of CRH transcripts in the preoptic area is consistent with its role as a hypophysiotropin in zebrafish. Zebrafish POU class III genes include brn 1. 2, zp 47, zp 12, zp 23 and zp 50. zp 47 and brn 1. 2 are found to be the direct homologs of the mammalian Brn- 2 gene. Expression of brn 1. 2 begins at tailbud stage. From 5 -somite stage on, brn 1. 2 is detected in the midbrain, hindbrain and weakly in the spinal cord. At 24 hpf brn 1. 2 is widely expressed in the diencephalon, midbrain and hindbrain but not detected in the telencephalon. At later stages of development brn 1. 2 transcripts were found in the hypothalamus, preoptic area, ventral thalamus, dorsal thalamus, pretectum, tectum, cerebellum and hindbrain. Additionally, brn 1. 2 was also detected in the otic vesicle at 48 hpf. In this study we have described the developmental expression pattern of brn 1. 2 and crh. Future studies will include a complete analysis of the function of brn 1. 2 in the specification of the hypothalamic neurons and also identification of other candidate genes that are required for the development these neurons...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} how {{prospective}} and retrospective memory are affected by health in old age. In this regard, we have focused on dementia disorders, depressive symptomatology, and thyroid functions. Prospective memory involves remembering to perform actions, such as paying bills or taking one s medication. Retrospective memory involves remembering previous events or previously learned information, such as the content of a book. The memory process {{can be divided into}} three stages: encoding (forming new memories), storage (consolidation of information), and retrieval (remembering what we have previously encoded). In Study I, three groups were included: persons with <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> persons with vascular dementia, and healthy control persons. The groups were compared on prospective and retrospective memory tasks. The two dementia groups were impaired compared to controls on both prospective and retrospective memory, and the impairment was evident for all stages of the memory process (i. e., encoding, storage and retrieval). However, there were no differences between the two dementia groups regarding the extent or pattern of memory deficits. Study II examined how prospective and retrospective memory were affected during the so called preclinical phase of <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (i. e., before the disorder had progressed so much that it could be diagnosed). Both prospective and retrospective memory was impaired three years prior to diagnosis. In addition, the results showed that more people at risk of developing <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> could be identified when the combined results from the two memory tasks were taken into account, compared to using only one task at the time. The unique contributions of both memory measures indicate that they are, at least in part, separable entities. When studying retrospective memory in more detail, we found that the impairment in preclinical <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> was present across all three memory stages. Study III examined how depressive symptoms affected prospective and retrospective memory. Depressive symptoms refers to a continuum, ranging from states (such as mild dysphoria) that are common also among healthy persons to severe depressive disorders. The results showed that retrospective memory was negatively affected by depressive symptoms. The effect was evident for storage and retrieval, whereas there was a non-significant trend in the same direction for encoding. Prospective memory, however, was unaffected by depressive symptoms. If these results are valid, this can help us separate persons with depression from persons with early stage dementia, which in many cases is difficult. Study IV examined the effect of thyroid functioning on prospective memory. Thyroid function was measured through serum levels of two hormones: thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T 4). All participants were free from thyroid disorders. In spite of this, the results revealed that persons with higher TSH levels performed better on the prospective memory task. T 4 levels were not related to memory performance. Previous research has shown a corresponding association between TSH and retrospective memory. The conclusion is that thyroid functioning has an impact on cognition, {{even in the absence of}} overt disease. To summarize, both prospective and retrospective memory are sensitive cognitive abilities, easily affected by disorders and other factors related to health. There are, however, some differences with regard to when, and how, these two forms of memory are affected. It is important to investigate this issue further, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the cognitive challenges that persons with different disorders or symptoms are facing. This can, in turn, lead to the development of new cognitive aids. In addition, cognitive psychology research can in some cases help us make faster and more accurate diagnoses...|$|E
40|$|<b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (AD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common forms of {{neurodegenerative}} disorders connected with gradual loss of cognitive functions such as episodic memory. The disease is related to pathological amyloid depositions and hyper phosphorilation of structural proteins in the brain which lead to progressive loss of function, metabolic alterations and structural changes in the brain. In vivo biomarkers need to be established to be able to set an early diagnosis, monitor disease progression and finally to observe pharmaceutical treatment effects. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the potential use of combining multivariate analysis with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to monitor disease and treatment in AD. Due to the complexity of <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> we hypothesized, that considering patterns of disease markers is more useful for the evaluation of patients or a study outcome, than making decisions based on single biomarkers alone.

The methods could successfully be applied in both animals and humans. Metabolic fingerprints of disease and treatment could be identified as well as patterns of atrophy.

Different climate zones {{and a host of}} {{different}} habitats make South Africa the perfect platform for rich floral diversity. This floral diversity lends itself to the study of natural products by discovering new natural drugs {{that can be used in}} the treatment of many illnesses. Studies into the antioxidant properties of plants that are used in traditional medicine are an important aspect of research to determine the rationale of the use of plants by traditional healers. Many neurodegenerative diseases, like epilepsy, Parkinson <b>s</b> and <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> <b>diseases,</b> are linked to oxidative stress. Antioxidants could play a major role as neuroprotective agents and could alter the progression of these diseases. Epilepsy is one of the world s most prevalent central nervous system disorders and affects more than seventy per one thousand children in South Africa. Most of these cases are people in rural areas of South Africa where communities rely on the use of traditional medicine. Cotyledon orbiculata L. var orbiculata (Haw.) DC. is widely used in traditional medicine to treat epilepsy and other central nervous system disorders. The need to screen these plants for activity and toxicity is very important to understand the complex mechanism of action in the treatment of patients. In this study the methanol extract and three different fractions of the methanol extract of Cotyledon orbiculata were used to test for antioxidant activity and toxicity towards neuroblastoma cells. The freeze dried leaves of Cotyledon orbiculata were extracted with methanol using a Soxhlet apparatus. The concentrated extracts were analysed using HPLC (high pressure liquid chromatography) and three major peaks were selected for isolation. Three assays were performed to assess the antioxidant activity and toxicity of the isolated compounds. The thiobarbituric acid assay (TBA) quantifies the extent of the inhibition of lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenates by the isolated fractions. All of the samples were able to attenuate lipid peroxidation as seen from the results obtained from the TBA assay. The methanol extract showed the best attenuation of lipid peroxidation in the rat brain homogenate with fraction 1 and 2 showing greater attenuation of lipid peroxidation than fraction 3. The nitroblue tetrazolium assay (NBT) quantifies the ability of the fractions to scavenge superoxide radicals in a rat brain homogenate. All samples were able to scavenge superoxide radicals as indicated by the NBT assay. The methanol extract showed the best superoxide scavenging abilities in the assay whereas fraction 1 showed better scavenging abilities than fraction 2 and 3. The 3 –(4, 5 –dimethylthiazol– 2 –yl) – 2, 5 –diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT) indicates the toxicity of the fractions towards neuroblastoma cells. The methanol extract and fraction 2 in the highest concentration of 10 mg/ml were the only samples that showed toxicity towards neuroblastoma cells. The molecular structure of a compound from fraction 2 was determined by using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and mass spectroscopy (MS). This compound was identified as diethyl malate. Diethyl malate is an artefact that is generated in HPLC procedures in the presence of malic acid (which naturally occurs in the leaves of Cotyledon orbiculata) and ethanol. The methanol extract of Cotyledon orbiculata has high antioxidant activity and could be due to the presence of malic acid in the leaves of the plant. The rationale in the use of Cotyledon orbiculata in the treatment of epilepsy could not be determined due to the isolation of an artefact, diethyl malate, obtained from the fraction. Further research should include methods to prevent artefact formation and purification of the samples that are obtained. Master...|$|R

The presence of abnormal levels of neurotrophic factors in Alzheimer's disease is one possible explanation for the increased concentration of aggregates of overgrown neurites in the neuritic plaques of <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease.</b> The protein <b>S</b> 100 beta, a neurotrophic factor produced by astroglia in the brain, induces neurite outgrowth in cerebral cortical neurons. The generation of specific S 100 beta antibodies, the cloning of a full-length cDNA encoding the S 100 beta mRNA, {{and the development of a}} neurite extension assay system for S 100 beta allowed testing of the hypothesis that <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> <b>S</b> 100 beta expression is elevated in brain temporal lobe where neuritic plaques are concentrated. The levels of S 100 beta protein, mRNA, and specific neurotrophic activity were elevated 10 - 20 -fold in extracts of temporal lobe from autopsy samples of Alzheimer's disease patients compared to those of aged control patients. The cells containing the increased S 100 beta were reactive astrocytes; the neuritic plaques were surrounded by S 100 beta-containing astrocytes. The elevated levels of S 100 beta provides a link between the prominent reactive gliosis and neuritic plaque formation in this common disease of the elderly and raises the possibility that S 100 beta contributes to Alzheimer's disease neuropathology...|$|R

Neuropathological hallmarks include amyloid plaque formation, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss. The deposit of senile plaques is consistent with induction of oxidative stress, and since free radical scavengers can alleviate amyloid-beta-induced oxidative stress markers, this study aims to identify the neuroprotective effects of the selenium compounds (ebselen and diphenyl diselenide) on the neurotoxicity of amyloid-beta in primary cultures of murine hippocampal neurons. Samples were subjected to immunocytochemistry and western blotting techniques to determine what influence the treatments may have on synaptic protein SNAP- 25 and neuronal death. There was a strong increase in relative cell viability associated with ebselen and diphenyl diselenide treatment. Significant increases were observed in the level of synaptic marker synaptosomal-associated protein SNAP- 25 with both selenium compounds treatment. Although demonstrated the potential protective effect of selenium compounds in the course of AD, further investigations of synaptic function are important as a therapeutic strategy for A...|$|E

40|$|Impairment of {{synaptic}} connections {{is likely}} to underlie the subtle amnesic changes occurring at {{the early stages of}} <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> <b>Disease</b> (AD). β-amyloid (Aβ), a peptide produced in high amounts in AD, is known to reduce Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), a cellular correlate of learning and memory. Indeed, LTP impairment caused by Aβ is a useful experimental paradigm for studying synaptic dysfunctions in AD models and for screening drugs capable of mitigating or reverting such synaptic impairments. Studies have shown that Aβ produces the LTP disruption preferentially via its oligomeric form. Here we provide a detailed protocol for impairing LTP by perfusion of oligomerized synthetic Aβ 1 - 42 peptide onto acute hippocampal slices. In this video, we outline a step-by-step procedure for the preparation of oligomeric Aβ 1 - 42. Then, we follow an individual experiment in which LTP is reduced in hippocampal slices exposed to oligomerized Aβ 1 - 42 compared to slices in a control experiment where no Aβ 1 - 42 exposure had occurred...|$|E

40|$|Altres ajuts: CIBERNED CB 06 / 05 / 0042 i BrightFocus Foundation (A 2014417 <b>S)</b> <b>Alzheimer’s</b> <b>disease</b> (AD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{characterized by}} abnormal accumulation of β-amyloid and tau and synapse dysfunction in memory-related neural circuits. Pathological and functional changes in the medial temporal lobe, a region essential for explicit memory encoding, contribute to cognitive decline in AD. Surprisingly, functional imaging studies show increased activity of the hippocampus and associated cortical regions during memory tasks in presymptomatic and early AD stages, whereas brain activity declines as the disease progresses. These findings suggest an emerging scenario where early pathogenic events might increase neuronal excitability leading to enhanced brain activity before clinical manifestations of the disease, a stage that is followed by decreased brain activity as neurodegeneration progresses. The mechanisms linking pathology with synaptic excitability and plasticity changes leading to memory loss in AD remain largely unclear. Recent studies suggest that increased brain activity parallels enhanced expression of genes involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity in preclinical stages, whereas expression of synaptic and activity-dependent genes are reduced by the onset of pathological and cognitive symptoms. Here, we review recent evidences indicating a relationship between transcriptional deregulation of synaptic genes and neuronal activity and memory loss in AD and mouse models. These findings {{provide the basis for}} potential clinical applications of memory-related transcriptional programs and their regulatory mechanisms as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to restore brain function in AD and other cognitive disorders...|$|R

40|$|Early {{diagnosis}} of <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (AD) is relevant {{in order to}} initiate symptomatic treatment with antidementia drugs. This will be of greater significance if the drugs aimed at slowing down the degenerative process (secondary prevention) prove to affect AD pathology and are clinically effective, such as γ-secretase inhibitors. However, there is currently no clinical assessment to differentiate the patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who will progress to AD from those with a benign form of memory impairment {{that is part of}} the normal aging process. Thus, there is great clinical need for diagnostic and predictive biomarkers, as well as biomarkers for classification purposes, to identify incipient AD in MCI subjects. The most promising cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker candidates are total tau protein (T-tau), phosphorylated tau protein (P-tau), and the 42 -andno acid form offi-amyloid (Aβ 42), which may, if used in the right clinical context, prove to have sufficient diagnostic accuracy and predictive power to resolve this diagnostic challenge...|$|E
40|$|Older {{drivers are}} often {{presented}} as a traffic safety problem. Age-related medical conditions such as dementias and stroke impair cognitive functions that are crucial for safe driving Uncertainty remains regarding the most appropriate clinical methods to assess driving fitness in these patient groups. Furthermore, preclinical dementia and cognitive impairment may affect driving performance and lead to an increased crash risk. The first general aim of the thesis {{was to investigate the}} presence of cognitive impairment (CI) in crash-involved persons from the general older driving population. The second was to study different methods to evaluate the fitness to drive in clinical groups of older adults. In study I a group of fatally crashed older drivers was investigated regarding neuropathology and informant-reported functioning. There were moderate to frequent densities of neuritic plaques (NPs), the hallmark of <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> was in 25 %. Such densities indicate the presence of <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in persons 65 to 75 years. There were also hippocampal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in 84 %. There was no relationship between responsibility for the crash and the presence of NPs. Informant-reported deterioration was associated with age, but not with NPs or NTFs. The results suggest that the persons with neuropathological signs of <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> may have been asymptomatic, or that the informants were not observant of subtle decline associated with pathological processes. Participants in study II were older drivers with temporarily suspended licenses due to unsafe driving. There were two subgroups: a) drivers involved in crashes and b) those with moving traffic violations. Compared to a control group with no recent crashes, subgroup a) had a lower level of performance on tests of visuoconstructive ability, psychomotor speed, and verbal and visuospatial episodic memory. There were no differences in performance between subgroup b) and controls. Results support the assumption of a causal relationship between CI and crashes in older drivers. Study III was a three-year follow-up investigation of study II. Mortality tended to be higher in the case group, as compared to controls, and the presence of dementia or CI differed between groups. Subgroup a) from study II performed worse on all neuropsychological tests than did both previously non-crash involved controls and subgroup b). There was also more deterioration over time in group a). Results suggest that many older drivers with unsafe traffic behavior may have a preclinical dementing disease or another serious medical condition. Study IV concerns stroke patients. The usefulness of a screening battery, the SDSA, to determine driving fitness, was evaluated. The SDSA was validated against driving test performance in 97 patients and attained 78 % of correct classifications. Incorrect classifications appeared to be due to factors such as level of premorbid driving skill. Study V deals with driving tests among older patients with CI. The outcome (pass/fail) of the tests was compared for two groups: 1) patients driving their own cars and 2) patients driving dual-control cars. There were 16 % more fails in group 2), but no overall difference on cognitive test scores between groups. Older patients with CI are probably more likely to fail the driving test when using dual-command cars because the need to adapt to an unfamiliar vehicle demands attentional resources that are needed to manage other aspects of the test. Older drivers with demonstrated unsafe traffic behavior should be cognitively assessed. This should also be the case for older license holders with medical conditions susceptible to cause CI. However, in a policy perspective, it is necessary to carefully weigh the individual and societal consequences of license revocation against the crash risk of older drivers with CI...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Soluble Alzheimer s A? {{oligomers}} autoinsert into neuronal cell membranes, {{contributing to}} the pathology of <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> <b>Disease</b> AD, and elevated serum cholesterol is {{a risk factor for}} AD, but the reason is unknown. We investigated potential connections between these two observations at the membrane level by testing the hypothesis that A? 1 42 relocates membrane cholesterol. Results Oligomers of A? 1 42, but not the monomeric peptide, inserted into cholesterol containing phosphatidylcholine monolayers with an anomalously low molecular insertion area, suggesting concurrent lipid rearrangement. Membrane neutron diffraction, including isomorphous replacement of specific lipid hydrogens with highly scattering deuterium, showed that A? 1 42 insertion was accompanied by outward displacement of membrane cholesterol, towards the polar surfaces of the bilayer. Changes in the generalised polarisation of laurdan confirmed that the structural changes were associated with a functional alteration in membrane lipid order. Conclusion Cholesterol is known to regulate membrane lipid order, and this can affect a wide range of membrane mechanisms, including intercellular signalling. Previously unrecognised A? dependent rearrangement of the membrane sterol could have an important role in AD...|$|E
