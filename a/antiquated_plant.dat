5000|$|In {{the first}} part of 1942 Lieutenant General William S. Knudsen of the War Production Board {{conducted}} an inspection of the Schweizer factory, still located {{on the second floor of}} the Elmira Knitting Mill. He looked at the <b>antiquated</b> <b>plant</b> and instructed the Schweizers to [...] "get out of here". He was instrumental in the move of the 2-8 production line to a new plant built for Schweizer Aircraft by the Defense Plants Corporation at the soon-to-be completed Chemung County Airport.|$|E
5000|$|Weston's first {{acquisition}} was the biscuit {{division of}} Mitchell & Muil, a century-old Scottish baker, in 1933. [...] He closed the <b>antiquated</b> <b>plant</b> at Aberdeen and moved production {{to a new}} facility with modern equipment at Edinburgh, {{with the intent of}} mass-producing a more affordable line of quality biscuits. [...] "He sold fancy biscuits at exactly half the price at which they were sold by the world-famous firms all around him and he coined money." [...] Fifteen months after entering the British market, Weston reported sales equal to the parent Canadian company. He further announced his intention to establish bread and biscuit operations at strategic locations throughout England, Scotland and Ireland:"Some may wonder why we are going so much into bread. The British Isles, we believe, are a favourable field at present not only for the biscuit business but infinitely more for the baking of good bread. We are being morally and financially supported in a very large move in Great Britain to make better bread. Better bread can only be made in Great Britain by using more Canadian wheat. The objective of our British development {{in the next few years}} will be along the line of bread-making." [...] Within a few years, Weston had acquired a string of biscuit and bread plants in the United Kingdom. In order to manage the growing overseas venture, he moved his family to England in 1935. By 1937, with 15 plants, employing more than 15,000 workers under the Allied Bakeries banner, Weston was being referred to in the Canadian press as [...] "Britain's Biggest Baker".By 1939, he controlled 30 bakeries throughout the British Isles.Meanwhile, Weston operations in the United States were reorganized in 1931 and a biscuit plant established at Passaic, New Jersey. In 1936, the company set up a new Weston's Biscuits factory at Battle Creek, Michigan, and three years later bought out bankrupt Associated Biscuit Co. of Salamanca, New York.|$|E
50|$|Franchise {{agreements}} {{limited the}} Dublin plant's distribution range to a 44-mile radius of Dublin, an area encompassing Stephenville, Tolar, Comanche and Hico. However, the plant's {{use of the}} original sugar recipe had made the plant popular far beyond its existing franchise agreement. Each year, as many as 80,000 visitors flocked to Dublin, drawn to the <b>antiquated</b> bottling <b>plant</b> and its old-fashioned soda.|$|R
25|$|In April 2001, an {{outbreak}} {{occurred in the}} city of North Battleford, Saskatchewan, Canada. Between 5800 and 7100 people suffered from diarrheal illness, and 1907 cases of cryptosporidiosis were confirmed. Equipment failures at the city's <b>antiquated</b> water filtration <b>plant</b> following maintenance were found to have caused the outbreak.|$|R
6000|$|Scott laughed. [...] "He couldn't take it out. Nobody {{would buy}} his share, and my fortune's {{represented}} by a shaft in danger of flooding and some cheap and <b>antiquated</b> boring <b>plant.</b> In fact, if we don't strike pay-dirt soon, the Clermont will go broke, and I imagine that's why Brinsmead skipped. After floating one or two small mines successfully, he has some reputation to lose, while I'm, of course, not an engineer or a business man." [...] He paused and looked hard at Thirlwell. [...] "I'd like you to stay and see me through, but wouldn't blame you if you quit." ...|$|R
50|$|An all {{volunteer}} group, the National Liberty Ship Memorial (NLSM), acquired Jeremiah O'Brien in 1979 for restoration. At that time, she {{was virtually}} the last Liberty at the anchorage. Amazingly, those {{who volunteered to}} resurrect the mothballed ship (led by Captain Edward MacMichael, NLSM Executive Director and Master) {{were able to get}} the <b>antiquated</b> steam <b>plant</b> operating while she remained in Suisun Bay. After more than three decades in mothballs, Jeremiah O'Brien's boilers were lit. The ship left the mothball fleet on 21 May 1980 bound for San Francisco Bay, drydocking, and thousands of hours of restoration work. She was the only Liberty Ship to leave the mothball fleet under her own power.|$|R
50|$|Robert K. Lane {{initially}} was appointed as Executive Director {{of the program}} in 2008 and served in that capacity until July 2010, when Allison Rogers was appointed as Director. A major accomplishment of the Green the Capitol Initiative was to coordinate with the Architect of the Capitol to convert the <b>antiquated</b> Capitol Power <b>Plant</b> from predominant use of coal, to cleaner natural gas. This initiative substantially reduced the Capitol Campus' carbon emissions and contributed to the enhanced air quality of the Capitol Hill area.|$|R
50|$|In 2001 {{a problem}} with the city's water system led to the {{infection}} of approximately 6280 people with cryptosporidiosis; a lawsuit for several million dollars in damages was filed in 2003. Between 5800 and 7100 people suffered from diarrheal illness, and 1907 cases of cryptosporidiosis were confirmed. Equipment failures at the city's <b>antiquated</b> water filtration <b>plant</b> following maintenance were found to have caused the outbreak. The provincial and municipal government offered compensation to victims after the lawsuit was approved in 2017. The North Battleford Energy Centre has been operational since 2010 with 170 MW gas fired turbine, providing a boost to the city's economy.|$|R
40|$|Most {{scholars}} {{agreed that}} firm age determines firm growth. They claimed that hazard rate will fall {{with time and}} firm survival increases with age of the firm. It is because new firms are perceived unable to achieve economies of scale and they rarely have the sufficient managerial resources and expertise. However, prior empirical studies on firm age do not provide conclusive evidence regarding its relationship with performance. Some scholars made another conflicting remarks stating that old firms are not flexible enough to make rapid adjustment, indicating barriers to innovate and make profit. Their organizational rigidities limit their growth by inhibiting change as they become harder to change over time. Older firms are also assumed to own <b>antiquated</b> machines, <b>plants</b> and equipment that limit their capability to innovate. These arguments has raised the interest for researchers to further study issues pertaining to firm age {{in a variety of}} contexts including in relation to the business development, technology and social systems. The study attempts to explore the relationship of firm age with intellectual capital, innovation capability and value production. The unit of analysis for the study is Small and Medium Enterprises operating in Malaysia...|$|R
50|$|In August, 1939, a {{plan was}} created to expand native {{ordnance}} production in case a war cut Australia {{off from the rest}} of the Commonwealth. The <b>antiquated</b> ammunition <b>plant</b> at Footscray was to be abandoned as soon as a more modern and efficient factory was built nearby. To differentiate between them, in 1940 the old factory briefly received the designation of Munitions Factory No.1 (MF1) and the new factory was designated Munitions Factory No.2 (MF2). Demand forced the old factory (later redesignated SAAF No.1) to remain open until the war's end. The new factory (now designated SAAF No. 2) would be the only one to remain open after the war. The plans to make one factory at Hendon was expanded to two factories (designated SAAFs No. 3 & No. 4) that were built only a few hundred metres apart. Conversely, the original plans to make two small factories at Rocklea (originally designated SAAFs No. 5 & No. 6) was abandoned and one large facility was made instead (SAAF No. 5). The sixth and last factory at Welshpool (originally to be designated SAAF No. 7) received the designation of SAAF No. 6.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the Conservation Law Foundation and the City of Quincy, Massachusetts sued the {{regional}} Metropolitan District Commission, {{saying that it}} violated clean water statutes because its <b>antiquated</b> sewage treatment <b>plant</b> on Deer Island was dumping hundreds of tons of black sludge into the harbor daily. The United States Environmental Protection Agency later joined the suit. Judge Mazzone ruled the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (which was the successor to the Municipal District Commission's operations of the Boston regional water and sewage systems), was in [...] "chronic, flagrant violation" [...] of federal law, and ordered it to set deadlines for a cleanup. He oversaw the case himself, rather than appointing a special master as judges often do in long-running cases.|$|R
