5|$|Spiderland is {{the second}} and final studio album by the American rock band Slint. It was {{released}} on March 27, 1991, through Touch and Go Records. Featuring dramatically alternating dynamics and vocals ranging from spoken word to shouting, the album contains narrative lyrics that emphasize alienation. Spiderland was Slint's first release on Touch <b>and</b> <b>Go,</b> <b>and</b> the group's only album to feature Todd Brashear.|$|E

500|$|Pharrell Williams {{participated in}} the fourth episode in which he {{elaborated}} on his experience {{with the creation of}} the album. Pharrell remarked upon the organic sound of the album, surmising that it [...] "feels like the only click track they had was [...] the human heartbeat". He felt that the record can be enjoyed by people of all ages due to the accessible nature of music, and concluded that Daft Punk [...] "could just get back on the spaceship that brought them here <b>and</b> <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> leave us. But they're gracious, they're nice robots. They chose to stay".|$|E
500|$|Adams {{works closely}} with her acting coach Warner Loughlin, and credits Loughlin for helping her {{organize}} and structure her thoughts. She uses an acting method taught by Loughlin, in which she attempts an understanding of her character's psychology by creating the character's back-story {{from the age of}} three. Adams prefers to work with confident directors who give her space to think for herself. She stays in character while filming, and finds it difficult to detach herself from roles and accents. She is not influenced by the size of a role and is drawn towards both leading and supporting parts. Describing herself as an obsessive performer, Adams has said, [...] "I'm never satisfied with the take. I'll walk away from it, but I could go <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> go. I've had to learn to be OK with it." ...|$|E

500|$|Obsidian drew {{on older}} {{computer}} RPGs for inspiration on the storyline and gameplay, like Fallout and the Ultima series. Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart said [...] "We've {{been thinking about}} a lot of older RPGs, and we have this feeling that something has been lost with recent RPGs." [...] He compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to Baldur's Gate II, stating that he wanted to expand upon the city of Neverwinter as Baldur's Gate II had done with its setting, Athkatla. [...] "We're looking at how to make Neverwinter a really intriguing place to be, and make it a place where you go and come back to <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> come back to and have it really be a center for the game," [...] Urquhart said. The game's story, while still revolving around the city of Neverwinter, would be unrelated to Neverwinter Nights. Instead of starting the game as a powerful, important character, players would begin Neverwinter Nights 2 as nobodies. Obsidian wanted realism in the game and concrete consequences for the player's actions. The story would be centered on the player character, who would have to gradually earn the respect of Lord Nasher and the city of Neverwinter.|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mel {{has been}} dubbed as a chameleon, and Outhwaite has {{suggested}} that she liked to bring variation to Mel's characterisation: [...] "When I arrived I liked the idea Mel was feisty and strong. I didn't want her turning into a wimpy character like so many women in soaps. You know, they're either bitches or they're slags or they're victims. I wanted to give Mel a bit of everything. Every woman has all those elements to their character. It's just working out where they come <b>and</b> <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> I don't think that's lack of continuity; I think that's a three-dimensional character." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1977, both Molland and Evans {{were out}} of the music business. Molland later {{described}} his dire economic circumstances: [...] "Thank God I had guitars and I was able to sell some of that stuff. We were flat broke, and that's happened to me three times, where my wife and I have had to sell off everything <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> stay with her parents or do whatever. I installed carpeting for a while in Los Angeles and stuff like that. You do what you've got to do to survive." [...] In London, Evans briefly had jobs insulating pipes, and driving a taxi. Collins was having trouble paying the lease on the group's two-room rehearsal studio at No. 6 Denmark Street, London. After advertising for new occupants, he was contacted by Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, who gave Collins £650 (...) and a Fender Rhodes piano as down payment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{precursor of}} modern chess {{is a game}} called chaturanga, which flourished in India by the 6th century, and is the earliest known game to have two essential features found in all later chess variations—different pieces having different powers (which {{was not the case}} with checkers <b>and</b> <b>Go),</b> <b>and</b> victory depending on the fate of one piece, the king of modern chess. The original chess board was mathematically revolutionary, as reported by the infamous Wheat and chessboard problem. A common theory is that India’s development of the board, and chess, was likely due to India’s mathematical enlightenment involving the creation of the number zero. Other game pieces (speculatively called [...] "chess pieces") uncovered in archaeological findings are considered as coming from other, distantly related board games, which may have had boards of 100 squares or more. Findings in the Mohenjo-daro and Harappa (2600–1500 BCE) sites of the Indus Valley Civilization show the prevalence of a board game that resembles chess.|$|E

2500|$|Brian Statham and Roy Tattersall {{had just}} arrived from snowbound Lancashire and were thrown into this minor game to get their first cricket since September. They each took a wicket, but the honours belonged to the {{previously}} underperforming Bob Berry who returned figures of 6/36 as the South Australian team were shot out for 84. The real shock occurred when a blonde fast bowler called Lou Curtis – ironically from Berri, South Australia – took 5 wickets before stumps after David Sheppard (37) and Reg Simpson (30) added 60 for the first wicket. He continued {{the next day and}} took 9/60 despite Denis Compton making 40 and Freddie Brown a punchy 77 to take the MCC to 234 and a lead of 150. This proved to be enough as the Country XI were out for 124, the wickets shared around the team. Tim Wall the South Australian state selector invited Curtis to the Adelaide Oval for a state trial, but he refused as he had to return to his wheat farm. [...] "The cricket season", he explained [...] "is the busiest time on the farm, especially with the harvesting. I don't intend to leave my brothers to it <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> play cricket".|$|E
2500|$|The anatta {{doctrine}} {{is not a}} kind of materialism. Buddhism does not deny the existence of [...] "immaterial" [...] entities, and it (at least traditionally) distinguishes bodily states from mental states. Thus, the conventional translation of anatta as [...] "no-soul" [...] can be confusing. If the word [...] "soul" [...] simply refers to an incorporeal component in living things that can continue after death, then Buddhism does not deny {{the existence of the}} soul. Instead, Buddhism denies the existence of a permanent entity that remains constant behind the changing corporeal and incorporeal components of a living being. Just as the body changes from moment to moment, so thoughts come <b>and</b> <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> there is no permanent state underlying the mind that experiences these thoughts, as in Cartesianism. Conscious mental states simply arise and perish with no [...] "thinker" [...] behind them. When the body dies, Buddhists believe the incorporeal mental processes continue and are reborn in a new body. Because the mental processes are constantly changing, the being that is reborn is neither entirely different from, nor exactly the same as, the being that died. However, the new being is continuous with the being that died – {{in the same way that}} the [...] "you" [...] of this moment is continuous with the [...] "you" [...] of a moment before, despite the fact that you are constantly changing.|$|E
