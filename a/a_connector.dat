5|$|In Elbridge, NY321 intersects {{with several}} county routes, {{including}} Halfway Road (CR107; former NY368), <b>a</b> <b>connector</b> highway {{leading to the}} hamlet of Halfway. Soon afterwards, NY321 turns to the northeast, heading towards NY5. The highway intersects Forward Road (unsigned NY931F) just inside the Camillus town line soon after the turn. Forward Road, a local road that passes through a mixture of open fields and forests, serves as <b>a</b> <b>connector</b> between NY321 and NY174.|$|E
50|$|Before SCART was introduced, TVs did {{not offer}} a {{standardised}} way of inputting signals other than RF antenna connectors, and these differed between countries. Assuming other connectors even existed, devices made by various companies could have different and incompatible standards. For example, a domestic VCR could output a composite video signal through <b>a</b> German-originated DIN-style <b>connector,</b> <b>an</b> American-originated RCA <b>connector,</b> <b>an</b> SO239 <b>connector</b> or <b>a</b> BNC <b>connector.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 2006, the US141 {{expressway}} {{was extended}} northward near Beaver, {{and the former}} route of US141, plus <b>a</b> <b>connector</b> roadway southwest of downtown Coleman was designated as a business loop. This route does not appear on the official Wisconsin Department of Transportation maps, {{so it is a}} locally designated business loop under local maintenance.|$|E
5|$|M-157 was {{originally}} designated in 1931 as <b>a</b> <b>connector</b> route between M-55 and US27 (present-day M-18). Just a year later, that version was decommissioned, {{and the road}} obliterated. A new alignment, the present-day routing of M-157, was then commissioned just to the east.|$|E
5000|$|The {{connectors}} are genderless. This avoids some awkward adapters or {{duplication of}} laboratory standards. With <b>a</b> gendered <b>connector,</b> <b>a</b> laboratory {{might need a}} precision male load and a precision female load. With <b>a</b> genderless <b>connector,</b> only one load is required.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> D-Terminal <b>connector</b> carries <b>a</b> {{component}} video signal (YPBPR). A device with <b>a</b> D5 <b>connector</b> can understand and display the following video signals: ...|$|R

50|$|The PC/104-Plus {{standard}} adds {{support for}} the PCI bus, {{in addition to the}} ISA bus of the PC/104 standard. The name is derived from its origin: a PC/104-Plus module has <b>a</b> PC/104 <b>connector</b> (ISA) plus <b>a</b> PCI <b>connector.</b> The standard defines <b>a</b> 120-pin <b>connector</b> for the PCI bus, located {{on the opposite side of}} the board from the PC/104 connector.|$|R
5|$|Between Cobleskill and Sharon Springs, NY10 {{proceeds}} northwest through rural terrain once more, {{with the}} points of interest limited to {{a small number of}} hamlets. Midway between the two locations in Seward, NY10 intersects NY165, <b>a</b> <b>connector</b> leading to Cooperstown via NY166 and Otsego County's County Route52 (CR52). In Sharon Springs, a village situated in northwest Schoharie County, NY10 intersects US20. Shortly after exiting the village, NY10 passes into Montgomery County.|$|E
5|$|From Hancock to the NY17 interchange, NY268 {{follows the}} pre-Quickway routing of NY17. Between NY17 and NY10, the route follows the former {{alignment}} of New York State Route236, <b>a</b> <b>connector</b> between then-NY17 and NY10 that existed during the 1930s. In the floods of 2006 {{some of the}} areas along this rural highway suffered serious landslides, leading to a temporary closure of the road.|$|E
5|$|Klemzig Interchange is {{the first}} station, three {{kilometres}} (1.8mi) from the city centre in the suburb of Klemzig. It was built as <b>a</b> <b>connector</b> to the city loop 'Circle Line' bus service, which followed the Adelaide outer ring route. Many bus services bypass Klemzig and the station has limited capacity. It contains a Park & Ride carpark with 450 spaces.|$|E
5000|$|There were {{at least}} four {{different}} connectors used with ALDL. [...] General Motors implemented both <b>a</b> 5-pin <b>connector</b> and <b>a</b> 12-pin <b>connector,</b> with the 12 pin connector (Packard/Delco/Delphi part number 12020043) {{being used in the}} vast majority of GM cars.

50|$|<b>A</b> DC <b>connector</b> is <b>an</b> {{electrical}} <b>connector</b> for supplying {{direct current}} (DC) power. For portable consumer electronic devices, the coaxial power connector is frequently used, {{but many other}} types of connectors also exist.|$|R
5|$|Type D: This Micro {{connector}} shrinks the connector size {{to something}} resembling <b>a</b> micro-USB <b>connector,</b> measuring only 6.4mm × 2.8mm For comparison, <b>a</b> micro-USB <b>connector</b> is 6.85mm × 1.8mm and <b>a</b> USB Type-A <b>connector</b> is 11.5mm × 4.5mm. It keeps the standard 19 pins of types A and C, but the pin assignment {{is different from}} both.|$|R
5|$|M-216 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that serves as <b>a</b> <b>connector</b> route between M-40 at Marcellus and US Highway131 (US131). The highway runs through a rural area of the southwestern part of the state. It {{has been a part}} of the highway system since 1935; the current form of the roadway was finalized in 1939. Between 2,400 and 3,900vehicles use the highway each day on average.|$|E
5|$|M-218 {{was a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that served as <b>a</b> <b>connector</b> route from Interstate 96 (I-96, originally US Highway16, US16) in Wixom through Oakland County's lake country area to Business US10 (Bus. US10) in Pontiac. M-218 was originally designated by 1936 and extended into Pontiac in 1938. The highway was decommissioned in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Most of NY37B west of Massena {{ran through}} a low-lying area along the St. Lawrence River. In 1958, {{this area was}} {{permanently}} indundated {{as part of the}} St. Lawrence Seaway's construction. As a result, NY37B was rerouted to follow a new roadway along the fringe of Lake St. Lawrence to meet NY37 in Louisville Corner. <b>A</b> <b>connector</b> between NY37 and NY37B in Louisville was designated as NY131 by 1960. The alignments of NY37B and NY131 west of Massena were swapped , placing NY37B on its modern alignment.|$|E
50|$|A {{device with}} <b>a</b> D-Terminal <b>connector</b> {{supports}} that level and lower D-Terminal signal. For example, <b>a</b> D4 <b>connector</b> {{can be used}} with a D4, D3, D2, or D1 signal, but not with a D5 signal.|$|R
50|$|Variants include ARJ45 HS, <b>an</b> 8-contact <b>connector,</b> and ARJ45 HD, <b>a</b> 12-contact <b>connector,</b> {{equivalent}} to the GG45 with a switch in the jack that activates the alternative pin locations when a Cat7a plug is inserted.|$|R
