5000|$|A {{split nut}} is a nut that is split {{lengthwise}} into two pieces (opposed halves) {{so that its}} female thread may be opened and closed over the male thread of a bolt or leadscrew. This allows the nut, when open, to move along the screw without the screw turning (or, vice versa, to allow the screw {{to pass through the}} nut without turning). Then, when the nut is closed, it resumes the normal movement of a nut on a screw (in which <b>axial</b> <b>travel</b> is linked to rotational travel) ...|$|E

Diaphragm-like axially flexible springs eliminate deadband and consequent nonlinear radial vibrational response of rotor. If shaft needs two bearings at each end, they are supported independently or connected in series by U-spring. Mechanical stops limit <b>axial</b> <b>travel</b> of shaft...|$|E
40|$|Computer {{simulation}} {{has been}} used to investigate several aspects of locomotion in salamanders. Here we introduce a three-dimensional forward dynamics mechanical model of a salamander, with physically realistic weight and size parameters. Movements of the four limbs and of the trunk and tail are generated by sets of linearly modeled skeletal muscles. In this study, activation of these muscles were driven by prescribed neural output patterns. The model was successfully used to mimic locomotion on level ground and in water. We compare the walking gait where a wave of activity in the <b>axial</b> muscles <b>travels</b> between the girdles, with the trotting gait in simulations using the musculo-mechanical model. In a separate experiment, the model is used to compare different strategies for turning while stepping; either by bending the trunk or by using side-stepping in the front legs. We found that for turning, the use of side-stepping alone or in combination with trunk bending, was more effective than the use of trunk bending alone. We conclude that the musculo-mechanical model described here together with a proper neural controller is useful for neuro-physiological experiments in silico...|$|R
40|$|Cut-away {{image of}} the fibre optic motion sensor showing the {{location}} of the fibre Bragg gratings and the rare earth magnet. A fibre optic motion sensor has been developed for monitoring the proximity and direction of motion of a ferrous bead <b>travelling</b> <b>axial</b> to the sensor. By integrating an array of these sensors into our previously developed fibre optic manometry catheters we demonstrate simultaneous detection of peristaltic muscular activity and the associated motion of ferrous beads through a colonic lumen. This allows the motion of solid content to be temporally and spatially related to pressure variations generated by peristaltic contractions without resorting to videoflouroscopy to track the motion of a radio opaque bolus. The composite catheter has been tested in an in-vitro animal preparation consisting of excised sections of rabbit colon. John W. Arkwright, Ian D. Underhill, Kelsi N. Dodds, Simon J. H.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a novel compliant linear guided mechanism (CLGM) to replace traditional spring and translation joint to transfer motion and force with its advanced guiding characteristics. In {{view of the}} incompatible relationship between axial stiffness and transverse stiffness of CLGM, eight kinds of CLGMs were developed by using building block approach based on fixed-guided flexure beam. The finite element analysis (FEA) models of eight CLGMs were built to complete numerical analysis on the force-displacement in axis and off-axis direction with same geometric sizes. The FEA {{results show that the}} structure configuration of Type 2 -Type 8 can achieve a larger <b>axial</b> <b>travel,</b> Type 2 and Type 4 have the advanced guiding characteristic with higher ratio of axial/transverse stiffness. Analysis indicates that the building block approach is an efficient method to complete the conceptual synthesis of compliant mechanism and FEA is effective on the structure optimization for the required compliance and stiffness in axial and transverse direction...|$|E
40|$|A load {{regulating}} mechanical latch {{is described}} {{that has a}} pivotally mounted latch element having a hook-shaped end with a strike roller-engaging laterally open hook for engaging a stationary strike roller. The latch element or hook is pivotally mounted in a clevis end of an elongated latch stem that is adapted for axial movement through an opening in a support plate or bracket mounted to a structural member. A coil spring is disposed over and around the extending latch stem and {{the lower end of}} the coil spring engages the support bracket. A thrust washer is removably attached to the other end of the latch stem and engages the other end of the coil spring and compresses the coil spring thereby preloading the spring and the latch element carried by the latch stem. The hook-shaped latch element has a limited degree of <b>axial</b> <b>travel</b> for loading caused by structural distortion which may change the relative positions of the latch element hook and the strike roller. Means are also provided to permit limited tilt of the latch element due to loading of the hook...|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 115 Magnetic {{drive and}} canned motor pumps have many common {{features}} including bearing and rotor designs, internal cooling, and lubrication. The primary differences {{center on the}} manner in which the rotating magnetic field is created and the makeup of the stationary isolation device. Proper bearing lubrication is essential to long, reliable operation. Fluid film journal bearings are used to support the rotor and flatfaced thrust bearings to limit its <b>axial</b> <b>travel.</b> Hydraulic balance can be used to limit the loads transmitted to the thrust bearings. This can accomplished by either balance holes and set clearance throttling devices or pumping vanes, as in standard pumps or by variable clearance throttles that automatically adjust to maintain axial balance. A rotating magnetic field is generated by either an electrical stator coil or a rotating permanent magnet assembly. This drives an inner rotor consisting of induction motor laminations or permanent magnets. The barrier between the inner rotor and the atmosphere contains the process, but has nonmagnetic properties to allow the passage of the field undisturbed. Eddy currents are set up in the barrier and generate heat that must be removed. A clean cooling stream with sufficient margin from vaporization is required to carry of the heat generated by magnetic hysteresis and bearing friction loses. The pressure/temperature characteristics of the process dictate the type of circulation needed to maintain a liquid state. Instrumentation is offered to help monitor the condition of the cooling stream and avoid deadheaded and dry-running operation...|$|E
