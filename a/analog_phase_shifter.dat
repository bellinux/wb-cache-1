Phased antenna arrays {{are often}} used in radio {{frequency}} tracking systems including radars, satellite and other communication systems. For precise tracking and in developing efficient communication systems, arrays with narrow beam-width are required. This necessitates {{the use of a}} large number of radiating elements in the array and consequently a large number of <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> to provide the required beam-forming and beam steering capabilities. This makes these large phased antenna arrays prohibitively expensive and there is a significant need to develop low cost systems but with comparable performance.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to implement monolithic <b>analog</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> based on barium strontium titanate (BST) coated sapphire substrates for IEEE 802. 11 b wireless local area network (WLAN) applications. It has been known that several BST thin film properties such as high relative permittivity, electric field dependence, fast polarization response, relatively low loss, and high breakdown field, allow for miniaturization and high performance of <b>analog</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shifters.</b> Before attempting to implement BST <b>phase</b> <b>shifters,</b> coplanar waveguides (CPWs) and interdigital capacitors (IDCs) based on various BST compositions and thicknesses have been developed and characterized to capitalize on the electrical properties of BST thin films. Based on the characteristics of BST thin films, two design topologies have been studied to implement <b>phase</b> <b>shifters.</b> The first topology is a reflection-type structure. The reflection-type <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> composed of a 3 -dB coupler and two identical reflective terminations has provided a large phase shift with a relatively low insertion loss. The second topology is an all-pass network structure. The all-pass network <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> consists of only lumped elements so that one can shrink in size of devices. The total chip area of the all-pass network <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> is only 2. 6 mm * 2. 2 mm with a loss figure-of-merit (FOM) of more than 69 deg/dB at 2. 4 GHz. This is the smallest size and the best performance obtained to date for BST <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> in the 2. 4 GHz band and comparable or even better than the state of the GaAs MMIC <b>phase</b> <b>shifters.</b> The nonlinear response of the all-pass network <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> also was investigated with two-tone intermodulation distortion (IMD) measurement. Furthermore, the all-pass network <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> was studied to ascertain a design to ensure minimum performance variation over a range of temperature and to determine which BST composition performed best in the face of temperature variations. Compact beamforming networks (BFNs) for WLAN systems using client-based smart antennas have been demonstrated to validate the feasibility of BST technology for WLAN applications.

40|$|The area of {{deterministic}} noise cancellation {{in mobile}} radio communication systems is investigated and analyzed. Several interoperation {{problems in the}} mobile wireless radio space are identified and interference concerns for the Bluetooth - WLAN networks are characterized and quantified in the physical layer. A mathematical framework has been created for describing interference in the 2. 4 GHz band. An adaptive noise suppression system has been developed that is able to alleviate the encroachment of the aggressor signal on the victim without sacrificing any of the original signal. This system is demonstrated to improve the victim SNR in a spread spectrum communication scenario. The research is extended to construct an interference canceller that is easy to assimilate into existing RF front-ends. A low-power small form-factor analog active canceller has been designed in 0. 18 -ìm Si-CMOS IC technology that delivers adequate noise suppression performance while operating in the RF domain. This includes novel implementations of phase rotator circuits based on delay interpolation and an integrated low-current quadrature modulator-based continuously variable <b>analog</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shifter.</b> This canceller is capable of up to 30 dB of in-band cancellation for the Bluetooth - WLAN problem. Other versions of the canceller are configured to protect GPS and DVB-H receivers from unintentional radiators transmitting in the vicinity.

40|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) {{has been shown to}} provide very sensitive measurements of surface deformation and displacement on the order of 1 cm. Future systematic measurements of surface deformation will require this capability over very large areas (300 km) from space. To achieve these required accuracies, these spaceborne sensors must exhibit low temporal decorrelation and be temporally stable systems. An L-band (24 -cmwavelength) InSAR instrument using an electronically steerable radar antenna is suited to meet these needs. In order to achieve the 1 -cm displacement accuracy, the phased array antenna requires phase-stable transmit/receive (T/R) modules. The T/R module operates at L-band (1. 24 GHz) and has less than 1 - deg absolute phase stability and less than 0. 1 -dB absolute amplitude stability over temperature. The T/R module is also high power (30 W) and power efficient (60 -percent overall efficiency). The design is currently implemented using discrete components and surface mount technology. The basic T/R module architecture is augmented with a calibration loop to compensate for temperature variations, component variations, and path loss variations as a function of beam settings. The calibration circuit consists of an amplitude and phase detector, and other control circuitry, to compare the measured gain and phase to a reference signal and uses this signal to control a precision <b>analog</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> and analog attenuator. An architecture was developed to allow for the module to be bidirectional, to operate in both transmit and receive mode. The architecture also includes a power detector used to maintain a transmitter power output constant within 0. 1 dB. The use of a simple, stable, low-cost, and high-accuracy gain and phase detector made by Analog Devices (AD 8302), combined with a very-high efficiency T/R module, is novel. While a self-calibrating T/R module capability has been sought for years, a practical and cost-effective solution has never been demonstrated.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to explore the {{potential}} of GaN Schottky diodes for high fre- quency signal generation and control, with emphasis on their power handling capability. GaN Schottky diodes are expected to provide superior power handling capability due to the wide band-gap of GaN. Theoretical analysis has been performed analytically and numerically. Devices have been fabricated and their performance has been evaluated experimentally. Demonstration of monolithic integrated circuits utilizing the realized devices was also made. The diode figure of merits e. g. Cj 0, Rs, Vbr, have been considered with respect to power handling and harmonic generation to permit evaluation of the diode design requirements for satisfying specific circuit needs. Numerical simulation allowed the prediction of device performance for specific geometry and material properties. Simulation results have shown that GaN Schottky diodes have a power handling capability at least 2 times higher than their GaAs counterparts, while maintaining acceptable losses. Several fabrication technology approaches have been studied and implemented for real- izing GaN-based Schottky diodes. Their key steps include dry etching, metal contacts, as well as interconnects. The surface treatment before metal deposition necessary for good quality Schottky contacts has been thoroughly studied. Three means of intercon- nect methods were demonstrated for on-wafer tests. They allowed rapid evaluation of the electrical characteristics of the diodes {{and set up the}} basis for the development of monolithic integrated circuits. High frequency small-signal measurements have been performed for the GaN Schot- tky diodes. The obtained S-parameters were used to extract equivalent circuit models. A parameter extraction procedure was established to de-embed the pad parasitics, and obtaining information about their intrinsic elements permitting in this way diode opti- mization. The large-signal characteristics of the fabricated diodes were measured on-wafer using a large-signal network analyzer. This novel characterization method provided immediate information about diode features such as power handling, loss etc. The time-domain waveforms of the diodes were obtained under various operating conditions allowing a better insight into the diode operation. Large-signal models of the diodes have been obtained by considering the extracted small- signal equivalent circuit characteristics and the large-signal measurement results.

Both the primary (drive) and the secondary resonators are assumed to have a high qualityfactor. Furthermore, the gyroscope employs electrostatic excitation and capacitivedetection. The thesis is divided into three parts. The first part provides the background informationnecessary for the other two parts. The basic properties of a vibratory microgyroscope,together with the most fundamental non-idealities, are described, a shortintroduction to various manufacturing technologies is given, and a brief review of publishedmicrogyroscopes and of commercial microgyroscopes is provided. The second part concentrates on selected aspects of the system-level design of amicro-electro-mechanical angular velocity sensor. In this part, a detailed analysis isprovided of {{issues related to}} different non-idealities in the synchronous demodulation,the dynamics of the primary resonator excitation, the compensation of the mechanicalquadrature signal, and the zero-rate output.

The third part concentrates on the design and implementation of the integratedelectronics required by the angular velocity sensor. The focus is primarily on the designof the sensor readout circuitry, comprising: a continuous-time front-end performingthe capacitance-to-voltage (C/V) conversion, filtering, and signal level normalization;a bandpass ΣΔ analog-to-digital converter, and the required digital signal processing(DSP).

Additionally, alternative ways to perform the C/Vconversion, such as continuous-time front ends either with or without the upconversionof the capacitive signal, various switched-capacitor front ends, and electromechanicalΣΔ modulation, are studied. In the experimental work done for the thesis, a prototype of a micro-electro-mechanicalangular velocity sensor is implemented and characterized.

40|$|Varactors form an {{important}} part of many communication circuits. They are utilized in oscillators, tunable matching networks, tunable filters and phase-shifters. This thesis deals with the design, analysis, characterization and applications of a novel MEMS varactor. Lower actuation voltage and higher dynamic range are the two important issues widely addressed in the study of MEMS varactors. The pull-in instability, due to which only 33 % of the gap between plates could be covered smoothly, greatly reduces useful dynamic range of MEMS varactors. We propose a torsional MEMS varactor that exploits “displacement amplification” whereby pull-in is overcome and wide dynamic range is achieved. The torsion beam in the device undergoes torsion as well as bending. Behavior of the device has been analyzed through torque and force balance. Based on the torque balance and the force balance expressions, theoretical limits of torsion angle and bending for stable operation have been derived. Torsional MEMS varactors and its variants are fabricated through a commercial fabrication process (polyMUMPS) and extensive characterization has been carried out. Capacitance-voltage characteristics show a maximum dynamic range of 1 : 16 with parasitic capacitance subtracted out from the capacitance values. A bidirectional torsional varactor, in which the top AC plate moves not only towards bottom plate but also away from bottom plate, is also tested. The bottom AC plate is isolated from low resistivity substrate with a thin nitride layer. This gives rise to large parasitic capacitances at higher frequencies. So to avoid this, a varactor with both AC plates suspended in air is designed and fabricated. A dynamic range of 1 : 8 including parasitic capacitances has been achieved. Self-actuation is studied on fabricated structures and a torsional varactor that overcomes self-actuation has been proposed. Hysteresis behavior of the torsional varactor is analyzed for different AC signals across the varactor plates. Effects of residual stress on C-V characteristics are studied and advantages and disadvantages of residual stress on device performance are discussed. The torsional varactors have been cycled between Cmax and Cmin for 36 hours continuously without any failure. High-frequency characteristics of torsional varactors are analyzed through measurements on one-port and two port configurations. Measurements are done on polyMUMPS devices to study the capacitance variation with voltage, quality factor (Q) and capacitance variation with frequency.

40|$|Separation for O {{wave and}} X wave {{is a very}} {{important}} job in interpretation of ionograms, which is premise for automatic scaling. In this paper, a new digital method for separating O wave and X wave is presented, based on a numerical synthesizing technique, which is different from using image recognition to separate trace O and trace X in the ionograms, and from using the electrical method to synthesize and detect circularly polarized waves. By replacing <b>analog</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> and switches in existing ionosonde with digital <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> with different initial phase, 0 °, + 90 °, − 90 °, circularly polarized waves are synthesized digitally within the range of 1 - 30 MHz, which eliminates the nonlinearity and expands the bandwidth of the ionosonde, and {{there is no need to}} switch the analog switches continuously. The new method has been successfully applied to CAS-DIS ionosonde and testing results show that the new digital method is capable of separating O wave and X wave well. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{millimeter}} wave (mmWave) {{frequency band}} offers substantial hitherto unused spectral resources for future wireless communication systems {{in order to}} meet the increasing capacity demand. However, mmWave frequencies suffer from high propagation losses, which may be mitigated by directional beamforming in addition to baseband precoding. This is usually referred to as hybrid beamforming. In this paper, we investigate the so-called discrete Fourier transform-mutually unbiased bases (DFT-MUB) aided codebook design conceived for limited-feedback mmWave systems, where the MUB aided codebook is applied in the baseband, while the DFT codebook is invoked for RF <b>analog</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shifters.</b> We demonstrate that our DFT-MUB codebook design performs similarly to the optimal digital precoding matrix, where the precoder is selected as the right singular matrix of the channel. However, our solution significantly reduces the search complexity in the baseband, while performing within 2. 5 dB from the optimal digital precoder...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{precoding}} (HP) {{is widely}} utilized in millimeter wave-based massive MIMO systems with significantly reduced radio frequency (RF) chains, but {{it requires a}} large number of <b>analog</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> (APSs) and RF adders to realize the connection between RF chains and antenna elements. In this letter, an adaptive hybrid precoding (AHP) is proposed to approach the performance of the conventional HP with reduced complexity. Different from the conventional HP where each antenna is connected to all RF chains through APSs and RF adders, the proposed AHP connects each antenna with only one RF chain through an adaptive connection network. This adaptive connection network and the phases of APSs are jointly designed, which is formulated as an optimization problem to maximize the users' average downlink achievable rate. Moreover, a multiuser adaptive analog precoding (MU-AAP) algorithm is proposed to provide a near-optimal solution to this joint-design problem. Simulation results verify the performance gain of the proposed AHP in typical multiuser massive MIMO scenario...|$|R
40|$|Realizing {{robust and}} stable two-way {{links between the}} mobile users and the {{satellite}} is an extremely challenging RF/Microwave engineering problem. Low cost and low profile phased array is considered as the best solution for this problem. High performance low cost and miniaturized variable <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> is a key enabling technology for such complex smart phased array antenna system. This thesis aims at {{the investigation of the}} existing solutions to realize miniaturized, low-cost {{and at the same time}} integrable <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> for commercial <b>phased</b> array antenna systems. Among few existing approaches, <b>analog</b> <b>phase</b> shifting devices based on voltage-tunable materials offers a promising solution. Liquid Crystal (LC) and Barium Strontium Titanate (BST) are the two voltage tunable materials, which, beside their own primary applications, have found their way into Microwave and mm-Wave tunable device technologies. In this study the utilization of LC and BST in <b>analog</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> has been rigorously investigated, the advantages and drawbacks of each when applied in different realizations have been discussed and further development and improvements in designs have been suggested. To achieve more compact designs for Ka-band <b>phase</b> <b>shifters,</b> a comprehensive design methodology for tunable filter-type <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> is proposed in this dissertation. The most commonly used phase shifting architectures for the phased array antennas are RF, LO, IF and base-band phase shifting. It should be mentioned that LO, IF and base-band phase shifting are not suitable for phased arrays with large number of elements due to the formidable cost and complexity, particularly for Tx phased array systems which require one <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> per antenna element to meet the radiation mask. Therefore, this thesis is concentrated on RF (Microwave/mm-Wave) phase shifting, which is the most common for large phased array antenna systems. Since one of the most important requirement in the design of Ka-Band <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> for <b>phased</b> array systems is the high level of miniaturization, dictated by antenna element spacing constraint, the thesis also addresses the highly compact structure of such <b>phase</b> <b>shifters.</b> In particular, a novel phase shifting concept based on very high dielectric constant materials has been explored. It is shown that by using this new concept, a highly miniaturized variable <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> with more than 360 degrees phase tuning range is attainable. 4 month...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{asymptotically}} optimal hybrid beamforming {{solution for}} large antenna arrays by exploiting {{the properties of}} the singular vectors of the channel matrix. It is shown that the elements of the channel matrix with Rayleigh fading follow a normal distribution when large antenna arrays are employed. The proposed beamforming algorithm is effective in both sparse and rich propagation environments, and is applicable for both point-to-point and multiuser scenarios. In addition, a closed-form expression and a lower bound for the achievable rates are derived when <b>analog</b> and digital <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> are employed. It is shown that the performance of the hybrid beamformers using <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> with more than 2 -bit resolution is comparable with <b>analog</b> <b>phase</b> shifting. A novel <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> selection scheme that reduces the power consumption at the <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> network is proposed when the wireless channel is modeled by Rayleigh fading. Using this selection scheme, the spectral efficiency can be increased as the power consumption in the <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> network reduces. Compared with the scenario that all of the <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> are in operation, the simulation results indicate that the spectral efficiency increases when up to 50 % of <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> are turned OFF...|$|R
