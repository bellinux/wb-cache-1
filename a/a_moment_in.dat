5|$|Cibber's comedy Love's Last Shift (1696) is {{an early}} herald of a massive shift in {{audience}} taste, away from the intellectualism and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender-role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy. According to Paul Parnell, Love's Last Shift illustrates Cibber's opportunism at <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> time before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something for everybody into his first play, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness.|$|E
5|$|The 2005–06 {{season was}} a disappointing {{one for the}} Rockets, as McGrady {{appeared}} in only 47 games due to injury. At various points during the year, he missed time due to back spasms, including <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> January where {{he had to be}} carried off the court in a stretcher due to a severe flare up. Despite his health concerns, McGrady was able to play in that year's All-Star Game in front of his home crowd in Houston, exploding for 36 points in just 27 minutes. For the season, he averaged 24.4 points and 6.5 rebounds per game. Due in part to his frequent absences, the Rockets failed to qualify for the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The poem was {{the first}} of Eliot's that relied on speech, with a narrator who speaks to the {{audience}} directly. Described as a poem of early summer, air, and grace, it begins with a narrator recalling <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> a garden. The scene provokes a discussion on time and how the present, not the future or past, really matters to individuals. Memories connect the individual to the past, but the past cannot change. The poem then transitions from memory to how life works and the point of existence. In particular, the universe is described as orderly and that consciousness is not found within time even though humanity is bound by time. The scene of the poem moves from a garden to the London underground where technology dominates. Those who cling to technology and reason are unable to understand the universe or the Logos ("the Word", or Christ). The underworld is replaced by a churchyard and a discussion of death. This, in turn, becomes a discussion of timelessness and eternity, which ends the poem.|$|E

25|$|The {{account is}} also an eschatology: the divine revelation {{concerns}} {{the end of the}} present age, <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> which God will intervene in history to usher in the final kingdom. The Book of Daniel gives no real details of the end-time, but it seems that God's kingdom will be on this earth, that it will be governed by justice and righteousness, and that the tables will be turned on the Seleucids and on those Jews who cooperated with them.|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{calligraphy}} {{was influenced}} by, and influenced, Zen thought. For any {{particular piece of}} paper, the calligrapher has but one chance to create with the brush. The brush strokes cannot be corrected, and even a lack of confidence {{shows up in the}} work. The calligrapher must concentrate and be fluid in execution. The brush writes a statement about the calligrapher at <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> time (see Hitsuzendō, the Zen way of the brush). Through Zen, Japanese calligraphy absorbed a distinct Japanese aesthetic often symbolised by the ensō or circle of enlightenment.|$|E
25|$|Artist Arnold Friberg was {{commissioned}} by Chevrolet to paint a series commemorating the 100th anniversary of American intercollegiate football in 1969. He created four paintings, each representing major turning points in the intercollegiate game. Painting No. four was titled O.J. Simpson Breaks for Daylight and captures <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> this famous Game of The Century. These paintings were used during the 1969 Chevrolet advertising campaign and {{were among the most}} demanding and exciting pieces Mr. Friberg had done. These paintings were such a success that they were taken on tour and shown at universities throughout the country.|$|E

With increased money from Castrol and John Clarke who encouraged associated sponsors to get on board, Perkins Engineering finally expanded to two cars. Peter was a great supporter of the cougars. For the record they came 13th in two Bathurst 1000 assaults.|$|E

25|$|I {{think of}} Ligonier as <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> {{the history of}} Orthodoxy in North America when a love for the missionary mandate of the Gospel transcended ethnic and {{cultural}} barriers and concerns. Ligonier provided a venue where Orthodox bishops offered words and visions of ecclesial unity. Ten years ago, the prophetic spirit of Ligonier stood opposed to jurisdictional pluralism even when other hierarchs, here and abroad, sought to justify the uncanonical status quo. Ten years ago, the bishops of Ligonier expressed a oneness of mind which exposed the falsehood that jurisdictional pluralism does not impede Eucharistic unity when, in fact, the presence {{of two or more}} bishops in one city undermines the very reality of ecclesial and, therefore, Eucharistic unity.|$|E

25|$|Mr. Vampire is a 1985 Hong Kong comedy horror film {{directed}} by Ricky Lau in his directorial debut, and also produced by Sammo Hung. The film's {{box office success}} {{led to the creation}} of a Mr. Vampire franchise, with the release of four sequels {{directed by}} Ricky Lau from 1986 to 1992, and subsequent similarly themed films with different directors released between 1987 and 1991. The vampire of the film is based on the jiangshi, the hopping corpses of Chinese folklore. The film was released under the Chinese title 暫時停止呼吸 (literally: Hold Your Breath for <b>a</b> <b>Moment)</b> <b>in</b> Taiwan. The film was the breakthrough success of the jiangshi genre, a trend popular in Hong Kong during the 1980s, and established many of the genre's recognisable tropes.|$|E
25|$|The Book of Daniel is an apocalypse, a {{literary}} genre {{in which a}} heavenly reality is revealed to a human recipient; such works are characterized by visions, symbolism, an angelic interpreter, and an emphasis on end-time events. Apocalypses were common from 300 BCE to 100 CE, not only among Jews and Christians, but Greeks, Romans, Persians and Egyptians. Daniel, the book's hero, is a representative apocalyptic seer, {{the recipient of the}} divine revelation. He refused to learn the wisdom of the Babylonian magicians and thus surpassed them, because his God is the true source of knowledge. The book is also an eschatology, meaning a divine revelation concerning the end of the present age, <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> which God will intervene in history to usher in the final kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The {{feast of}} the Epiphany is celebrated by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which falls on 11 Tobe of the Coptic calendar, as the moment when in the baptism of Jesus the skies opened and God himself {{revealed}} to all as father of Jesus and all mankind. It is then a moment of revelation of epiphany. This celebration started to include all the processes of incarnation of Jesus, from his birth on Christmas until his baptism in the river Jordan. For the Coptic Orthodox Church it is also <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> which the path of Jesus to the Cross begins. Therefore, in many celebrations there are certain similarities with the celebrations of Holy Friday {{during the time of}} Easter. Since the Epiphany is one of the seven great feasts of the Coptic Orthodox Church, it is a day of strict fasting, and several religious celebrations are held on this day. The day is related to the blessing of waters that are used all throughout the year in the church celebrations, and it is a privileged day to celebrate baptisms. It is also a day in which many houses are blessed with water. It may take several days for the local priest to bless all the houses of the parishioners that ask for it, and so the blessing of the houses may go into the after-feasts of the Epiphany celebrations. However, it must be done before the beginning of Lent.|$|E
