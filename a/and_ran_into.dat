5|$|After this {{construction}} was complete, {{there were still}} more calls to further develop the site, and especially to provide facilities for education about the wars. A $62million proposal was presented in 2006, incorporating a museum and an underground carpark. Designed once again by Ashton Raggatt McDougall, the proposal was opposed by local residents and some council members, <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> significant funding problems when the Federal Government decided not to provide funding.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann patiently {{waited for}} the right moment to escape, then, using the {{distraction}} of the Stukas attack, he attacked the single guard. Hartmann jumped {{out of the back of}} the truck <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> a large field of giant sunflowers. Evading the pursuing soldiers, Hartmann hid and waited for nightfall. In the dark, Hartmann followed a Soviet patrol heading west to the front. As he approached the German position, he was challenged by a sentry who fired a shot which passed through his trousers.|$|E

5|$|A one-yard rush was {{followed}} by a pass to running back Ken Oxendine that lost three yards. Following the negative-yardage play, North Carolina committed a five-yard penalty that gave the Hokies a third down and seven. Despite the extra yardage provided by the penalty, Clark's pass attempt on third down was incomplete and the Hokies again prepared to punt. During the kick, however, North Carolina defender Quinton Savage broke through the Virginia Tech offensive line and blocked the punt by Jimmy Kibble. Tar Heels' defender Dre Bly picked up the loose ball <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the end zone for North Carolina's second touchdown of the game. Following the play, North Carolina was penalized 15 yards for excessive celebration and the resulting 35-yard extra point kick was no good. Despite the missed kick, North Carolina extended its lead to 160 with 1:03 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|As the {{blizzard}} progressed, Patrick Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped off his clothes, <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and {{died a few}} hours later. Not long after, possibly because 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. The next morning, the group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy and dried it to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure that nobody would have to eat his or her relatives.|$|E
5|$|At around 13:00, {{tanks of}} the Panzer-Lehr Division {{advanced}} into Villers-Bocage unsupported by infantry. Four Panzer IVs tried to enter {{from the south}} near a wrecked Panzer IV and two were knocked out by anti-tank fire. Some Tigers were brought up and, in an exchange of fire, silenced the anti-tank position. Möbius divided the primary counter-attack down the main highway through Villers-Bocage and through the southern section of town parallel to the main road, to secure the town centre. The Tigers advanced slowly to intimidate the British into withdrawing <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the British ambush. The Firefly opened fire on the lead tank and missed but the anti-tank gun knocked it out. A group of three Tigers split up and drove through the back streets to flank the British; one was engaged by an anti-tank gun and destroyed, {{the other two were}} engaged with PIATs, one was knocked out and the other immobilised.|$|E

5|$|By 9March1968, the U.S. {{facility}} {{on top of}} Phou Pha Thi was surrounded by North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao units. The VPA 766th Regiment and one Pathet Lao battalion totalled more than 3,000 men. Despite {{the gravity of the}} situation, Sullivan did not issue an order for the evacuation of U.S. personnel from Phou Pha Thi. At around 18:00 on 10March, Lima Site 85 was subjected to a series of artillery barrages. Under the cover of the artillery bombardment, the North Vietnamese Special Forces sent a small team up the mountain to defuse mines and quick-fuse grenades, and to establish their routes of infiltration. Inside the facility, U.S. technicians immediately grabbed their weapons <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> trenches and bunkers, thereby abandoning the very equipment which could enable them to call for air support. At 19:45 the barrage stopped, and the U.S. technicians returned to their positions.|$|E
5|$|Norris {{began to}} plan for the rescue of Walker, still more than a {{kilometer}} behind front lines. Walker managed to evade capture for almost 11 days when on the night of April 18, without FAC coverage, he moved on his own accord <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> a local villager who alerted the North Vietnamese. They began tracking him and the next morning the FAC saw NVA very near Walker's position. Walker radioed the FAC that rescue should not be attempted because NVA forces were closing in and he was under fire. Bilk 36, a OV-10A flown by FAC 1st Lt. Mickey Fain, reported that Walker was surrounded by more than 20 NVA soldiers and shortly afterward saw his body lying in the grass. Walker's body was never recovered.|$|E
5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made of discarded tires that {{has proven to be}} an ecological disaster. The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E

5|$|On 26 October 1952, the Comet {{suffered}} {{its first}} hull loss when a BOAC flight departing Rome's Ciampino airport failed to become airborne <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> rough {{ground at the}} end of the runway. Two passengers sustained minor injuries, and the aircraft, G-ALYZ, was a total loss. On 3 March 1953, a new Canadian Pacific Airlines Comet 1A, registered CF-CUN and named Empress of Hawaii, failed to become airborne while attempting a night takeoff from Karachi, Pakistan, on a delivery flight to Australia. The aircraft plunged into a dry drainage canal and collided with an embankment, killing all five crew and six passengers on board. The accident was the first fatal jetliner crash, as well as the Comet's first accident to result in fatalities. In response, Canadian Pacific cancelled its remaining order for a second Comet 1A and never operated the type in commercial service.|$|E
5|$|With 42 seconds remaining, the Jets {{still had}} a chance to score; however, on the kickoff, New York return man Earl Christy fumbled the ball at the Jets' 12-yard line when he was tackled by Raiders linebacker Bill Budness. Oakland reserve running back Preston Ridlehuber picked up the fumbled ball <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the end zone, which with another Blanda extra point gave the Raiders a 43–32 lead, deflating any hopes of the Jets coming back to win the contest. Ridlehuber could not {{remember}} whether AFL rules permitted advancing a fumbled kickoff return (they did), so tried to make it appear he was entering the end zone with the same motion he gathered in the ball. Oakland kicked off to New York again, but it could do little with the ball in the final seconds, and the game ended.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland rebounded {{from its}} first {{loss of the}} season with a 31–28 victory over the Rockets. The game started slow; Groza's 21-yard field goal was the only score in the first quarter. The Rockets then went ahead by scoring a {{touchdown}} on a long pass from quarterback Vacanti to end Elroy Hirsch. Cleveland, however, piled on the points as Motley ran for a touchdown in the second quarter and Speedie caught a pass from Graham in the third. Jones added two touchdown runs in the fourth quarter, giving Cleveland a 31–14 lead. Chicago almost caught {{up at the end of}} the game, scoring two touchdowns, but the Browns held on to win. Cleveland's third-string players were on the field in the closing minutes when Chicago made its final push. Rockets rookie Ray Ramsey had three touchdowns in the game. Graham had 239 passing yards on 10 completions. Speedie caught half of them, gaining 166 yards. His touchdown came after he dropped to the ground to grab a 17-yard pass from Graham. He faked a backward lateral while on the ground, which drew Chicago's defense away from him, and then got up <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the end zone.|$|E

5|$|Lavender {{created a}} {{controversy}} {{in a game}} on September23, when he was caught altering the baseball by rubbing it against an emery board that he had attached to his uniform's pant leg, an illegal act. At the time, the fine for such an infraction was a five-dollar fine. The Phillies players noticed that the pitcher was constantly scratching {{the side of his}} leg. They asked the umpire to search the pitcher. Lavender refused to be searched <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the outfield, and the umpire refused to chase Lavender. Eventually, a particularly fast Phillies player, Hans Lobert, was able to catch up with him and grab the offending item. As a result of this incident, AL president, Ban Johnson, decreed that any pitcher in his league caught using sandpaper to alter the baseball, would be suspended for 30days and fined $100. This rule became the forebearer of the rule banning other pitches as well, including the spitball. In his 37 games pitched in 1914, 28were as the starting pitcher. His win–loss record was 11–11, and he lowered his ERA down to 3.07in 214innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|On the January 2 {{episode of}} Raw, the Ladies in Pink turned their {{attention}} to backstage announcer Maria Kanellis, blaming her for Victoria's loss in a match. Victoria announced to Maria that they had a match scheduled that night and proceeded to attack her before the bell. Although Victoria seemed to have the advantage in the match, which included interference from Wilson and Chloe, Victoria was pinned after she attempted an offensive maneuver but missed <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the turnbuckle, allowing Maria to pin her. After the match, Candice Michelle, Wilson, and Victoria attacked Maria until Ashley Massaro ran down to the ring to assist Maria. The conflict between the Divas caused the Chairman, Vince McMahon, to make a Bra and Panties Gauntlet match at New Year's Revolution, which Massaro won when she eliminated Victoria by removing her shorts. The next night on Raw, the Ladies in Pink announced that they had changed the name of their alliance to Vince's Devils. The storyline rivalry with Massaro continued on the January 23 episode of Raw, when Victoria and Candice Michelle were defeated by Trish Stratus and Massaro in a tag team match. At the Royal Rumble on January 30, the three women were shown in backstage segments flirting with McMahon.|$|E
5|$|The 24th Division {{was among}} the 200,000 men of the Sixth Army which moved to {{recapture}} Luzon from the Japanese 14th Area Army, which fought delaying actions on the island. The division's 34th Infantry Regiment landed at San Antonio, Zambales on 29 January 1945 <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> a furious battle on Zig Zag Pass, where it suffered heavy casualties. On 16 February 1945 the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry {{took part in the}} amphibious landing on Corregidor and fought the Japanese on the well-defended island. The rest of the division landed at Sablayan, Mindoro on 19 February, cleared the remainder of the island and engaged in numerous mopping up actions during the following month. These operations were complete by 18 March, and the division moved south to attack through Basilan. the division landed at Mindanao on 17 April 1945 and cut across the island to Digos until 27 April, stormed into Davao on 3 May, and cleared Libby airdrome on 13 May. Although the campaign officially closed on 30 June, the division continued to clear up Japanese resistance during July and August 1945. The 24th Infantry Division and the Philippine Commonwealth military patrolled the region until the official surrender of Japan ended the war. On 15 October 1945 the division left Mindanao for occupation duty on mainland Japan.|$|E
