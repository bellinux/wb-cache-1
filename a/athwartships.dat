25|$|Whereas 20th-Century square-rigged vessels were {{constructed}} of steel with steel standing rigging, prior vessels used wood masts with hemp-fiber standing rigging. As rigs became taller {{by the end}} of the 19th Century, masts relied more heavily on successive spars, stepped one atop the other to form the whole, from bottom to top: the lower mast, top mast, and topgallant mast. This construction relied heavily on support by a complex array of stays and shrouds. Each stay in either the fore-and-aft or <b>athwartships</b> direction had a corresponding one in the opposite direction providing counter-tension. Fore-and-aft the system of tensioning started with the stays that were anchored at in front each mast. Shrouds were tensioned by pairs deadeyes, circular blocks that had the large-diameter line run around them, whilst multiple holes allowed smaller line—lanyard—to pass multiple times between the two and thereby allow tensioning of the shroud.|$|E

2500|$|From 1938 to 1941, London {{received}} an altogether more comprehensive modernisation. Her upperworks were removed {{and replaced by}} new fore and aft superstructures and two upright funnels modelled on the contemporary [...] cruisers. The forward superstructure block incorporated a large hangar opening onto an <b>athwartships</b> catapult between the superstructure blocks. There was a catapult {{on either side of}} the after funnel. The 4-inch anti-aircraft guns were replaced by twin mountings and relocated to the after superstructure, with the torpedoes a deck below. The 2-pounder guns were carried on the hangar roof and the multiple Vickers guns mounted, one each, on the roofs of [...] "B" [...] and [...] "X" [...] turrets. A [...] belt, [...] deep, was added abreast the machinery spaces, extending up to the armoured deck. However, the hull had originally been carefully designed to reduce weight based on the initial arrangements. The modifications to London added heavy weights fore and aft and severely overstressed the hull. As a result cracks and loose rivets began to appear on the upper deck. The upper deck was reinforced, which caused the stress to be transmitted through the lower hull instead and cracks began to appear under the waterline. It took underwater reinforcements and refits extending into 1943 to remedy the situation.|$|E
2500|$|By the mid-1930s, the British Kents {{were due}} for modernisation.

A [...] armoured belt, [...] thick, was added amidships, extending down from the armoured deck to 1 foot below the waterline. Cumberland and Suffolk had the aft superstructure razed and replaced by a large hangar for two aircraft and a fixed <b>athwartships</b> catapult. A crane was fitted {{on either side of the}} after funnel, and the rear gunnery, navigation and control positions were relocated to the hangar roof. The single 2-pounder guns were removed, and quadruple mountings, Mark VII, were added on either side of the bridge. The 4-inch guns were relocated, and the rearmost pair were replaced by twin mountings Mark XIX for the QF 4-inch Mark XVI. To keep weight within acceptable margins, the hull was cut down by one deck aft of [...] "Y" [...] turret. Berwick and Cornwall were similarly converted, but with more weight in hand the hull was not cut down; all four 4-inch mounts were twins and the 2-pounder guns were octuple mounts.

40|$|The use of multibeam echo {{sounders}} (MBES) {{has grown}} more frequent in applications like seafloor imaging, fisheries, and habitat mapping. Calibration of these instruments {{is important for}} understanding and validating the performance of MBES. For echo sounders in general, different calibration methodologies have been developed in controlled environments such as a fresh water tank and in the actual field of operation. While calibration in an indoor tank facility can bring excellent results in terms of accuracy, {{the amount of time}} required for a complete calibration can become prohibitively large. A field calibration can reveal the actual radiation beam pattern for shipmounted sonar systems, accounting for acoustic interferences which may be caused by objects around the installed transducers. The standard target method is a common practice for field calibration of split-beam echo sounders. However, when applied to a Mills Cross MBES, this method does not provide means to determine the alongship angle of the target, since the receiver transducer is a line array. A method to determine the combined transmit/receive radiation beam pattern for a ship-mounted multibeam system was developed and tested for a Reson Seabat 7125 MBES inside the fresh water calibration tank of the University of New Hampshire. This calibration methodology employs a tungsten carbide sphere of 38. 1 mm diameter as target and a Simrad EK 60 split-beam sonar system to provide <b>athwartship</b> and alongship angular information of the target sphere position. The multibeam sonar system was configured for 256 beams equi-angle mode at an operating frequency of 200 kHz; the split-beam system was set to work passively at the same frequency. A combined transmit/receive beam pattern was computed for an <b>athwartship</b> angular range between – 6 o and + 6 o and an alongship angular range between – 1 o and + 3 o. The limited angular range of the measurements is due to the – 3 dB beamwidth of 7. 1 o in the <b>athwartship</b> and alongship directions of the split-beam sonar system coupled with the alongship offset of 1. 6 o between the maximum response axes (MRA) of the two sonar systems. Possible acoustic interferences caused by the monofilament line used to suspend the target sphere in the water column were found in the measurements for alongship angle values less than – 1 o. Beam pattern measurements for the combined transmit/receive beam pattern at a distance of 8 m show a – 3 dB beamwidth of 1. 1 o in the <b>athwartship</b> direction and a – 3 dB beamwidth of 2. 0 o in the alongship direction for the most inner beams.
