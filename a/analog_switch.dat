50|$|When {{there are}} many I²C devices in a system, {{there can be a}} need to include bus buffers or {{multiplexers}} to split large bus segments into smaller ones. This can be necessary to keep the capacitance of a bus segment below the allowable value or to allow multiple devices with the same address to be separated by a multiplexer. Many types of multiplexers and buffers exist and all must take into account the fact that I²C lines are specified to be bidirectional. Multiplexers can be implemented with <b>analog</b> <b>switches,</b> which can tie one segment to another. <b>Analog</b> <b>switches</b> maintain the bidirectional nature of the lines but do not isolate the capacitance of one segment from another or provide buffering capability.|$|R
40|$|The IEEE 1149. 4 Standard for a Mixed-Signal (MS) Test Bus proposes an {{extension}} to the well-accepted IEEE 1149. 1 boundary-scan test architecture, {{with the objective}} of facilitating interconnect, parametric and internal testing of MS circuits. An Analog Test Access Port (ATAP) comprising two pins called AT 1 and AT 2, and an internal analog bus (AB) comprising two lines (AB 1, AB 2), enable analog test stimulae and responses to be routed to any pin possessing an Analog Boundary Module (ABMs replace the IEEE 1149. 1 test cells in the case of analog pins). A Test Bus Interface Circuit (TBIC) comprising ten <b>analog</b> <b>switches</b> defines how the ATAP and the internal analog bus are (dis) connected, and the six <b>analog</b> <b>switches</b> in each ABM define what connections should be established between the pin, the core circuitry, and the internal analog bus. The large number of <b>analog</b> <b>switches</b> in the 1149. 4 test architecture may raise concerns about their integrity, particularly when they are used frequently, as would be the case in an 1149. 4 -based MS debug strategy. This paper proposes a set of integrity check procedures that address only the 1149. 4 extensions: ATAP, TBIC, AB lines, ABMs. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

50|$|The {{analogue}} (or <b>analog)</b> <b>switch,</b> {{also called}} the bilateral switch, is an electronic component that behaves {{in a similar way}} to a relay, but has no moving parts. The switching element is normally a pair of MOSFET transistors, one an N-channel device, the other a P-channel device. The device can conduct analog or digital signals in either direction when on and isolates the switched terminals when off. Analogue switches are usually manufactured as integrated circuits in packages containing multiple switches (typically two, four or eight). These include the 4016 and 4066 from the 4000 series.|$|E
