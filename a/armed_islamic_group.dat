At one point in the flight, the men placed one pack of dynamite in the cockpit and one pack under a seat {{in the middle of the}} aircraft. The men linked them with detonator wire. They also took the uniforms of the pilots to confuse Algerian army snipers.|$|E

50|$|After {{the riots}} of 1988, the Algerian {{government}} had moved towards democracy, holding free elections. However, when the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) {{won the first}} free parliamentary election in 1991, the military staged a coup d'état, voided the election results, {{declared a state of}} emergency which remained in force until 2011, and arrested the FIS leadership. This led to the founding of the <b>Armed</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Groups</b> (GIA) and the ten-year Algerian Civil War, in which an estimated 250,000 people were killed.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, a {{military}} coup d'état cancelled elections which the FIS {{was on the verge}} of winning, and banned the organization. The Brotherhood condemned the coup, but refused to join the resulting violent uprising by FIS sympathizers and the <b>Armed</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Groups</b> (GIA) against the Algerian state and military. Instead, the group urged a peaceful resolution to the conflict and cooperation with the state, which for a time caused some strains with the international Muslim Brotherhood, where many sympathized with the Islamist insurgency.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, {{under the}} {{pseudonym}} of Nasreddin Lebatelier, he published Le Statut des Moines from Lebanon.This pamphlet included {{a translation of}} a short work by the famed 13th-14th century Muslim scholar Ibn Taymiyya, called On the Statute of Monks, which is read {{by some as a}} call for the killing of Christian monks if they are found outside their monasteries in a Muslim country. Lebatelier's introduction referred to the Algerian <b>Armed</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Group's</b> (GIA) killing of seven Trappist monks in Tibhirine in 1996. He analysed not only the GIA's justification for the killings but also the Muslim community's consensus (ijmâ') which condemned these assassinations, and explained the religious authoritativeness of such a consensus. He was nevertheless accused of having condoned the killing of the seven Trappists by Catholic authorities and media, notably by Marcel Crochet, the Rector of the Catholic University of Louvain where he was employed (June 26, 1997).|$|R

25|$|The <b>Armed</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Group,</b> {{active in}} Algeria between 1992 and 1998, {{was one of}} the most violent Islamic {{terrorist}} groups, and is thought to have takfired the Muslim population of Algeria. Its campaign to overthrow the Algerian government included civilian massacres, sometimes wiping out entire villages in its area of operation. It also targeted foreigners living in Algeria, killing more than 100 expatriates in the country. In recent years it has been eclipsed by a splinter group, the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), now called Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb.|$|E
500|$|Four U.S. Navy {{ships and}} the {{submarine}} USS Columbia, {{stationed in the}} Arabian Sea, fired between 60 and 75 Tomahawk cruise missiles into Afghanistan at the Zhawar Kili Al-Badr camp complex in the Khost region, which included a base camp, a support camp, and four training camps. Peter Bergen identifies the targeted camps, located in Afghanistan's [...] "Pashtun belt," [...] as al-Badr 1 and 2, al-Farooq, Khalid bin Walid, Abu Jindal, and Salman Farsi; other sources identify the Muawia, Jihad Wahl, and Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami camps as targets. According to Shelton, the base camp housed [...] "storage, housing, training and administration facilities for the complex," [...] while the support camp included weapons-storage facilities and managed the site's logistics. Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Algerian <b>Armed</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Group</b> also used the Khost camps, as well as Pakistani militant groups fighting an insurgency in Kashmir, such as Harkat Ansar, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen. The rudimentary camps, reputedly run by Taliban official Jalaluddin Haqqani, were frequented by Arab, Chechen, and Central Asian militants, {{as well as the}} ISI. The missiles hit at roughly 10:00 PM Khost time (17:30 GMT); as in Sudan, the strikes were launched at night to avoid collateral damage. In contrast to the attack on Al-Shifa, the strike on the Afghan camps was uncontroversial.|$|E
50|$|The Beslan school siege (also {{referred}} to as the Beslan school hostage crisis or Beslan massacre) started on 1 September 2004, lasted three days, involved the illegal imprisonment of over 1,100 people as hostages (including 777 children), and ended with the death of at least 385 people. The crisis began when a <b>group</b> of <b>armed</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Groups,</b> mostly Ingush and Chechen, occupied School Number One (SNO) in the town of Beslan, North Ossetia (an autonomous republic in the North Caucasus region of the Russian Federation) on 1 September 2004. The hostage-takers were the Riyadus-Salikhin Battalion, sent by the Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev, who demanded recognition of the independence of Chechnya, and Russian withdrawal from Chechnya. On the third day of the standoff, Russian security forces stormed the building with the use of tanks, incendiary rockets and other heavy weapons. At least 330 hostages were killed, including 186 children, with a significant number of people injured and reported missing.|$|R

The Muslim Brotherhood in Algeria did not join the Front islamique du salut (FIS), which emerged as the leading Islamist group, winning the 1991 elections and which was banned in 1992 following a military coup d'état, although some Brotherhood sympathizers did. The Brotherhood subsequently also refused to join the violent post-coup uprising by FIS sympathizers and the <b>Armed</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Groups</b> (GIA) against the Algerian state and military which followed, and urged a peaceful resolution to the conflict and a return to democracy. It has thus remained a legal political organization and enjoyed parliamentary and government representation. In 1995, Sheikh Nahnah ran for President of Algeria finishing second with 25.38% of the popular vote.

[...] "Nothing changed from 1993 to 1997" [...] continued Tigha, executions followed arrests. According to Tigha, the police and military were “well aware of what was going on” and their job was to “collect and bury the corpses," [...] on which the acronym OJAL was written. The organization had also posted false flyers to accredit its existence, which was allegedly only a useful cover to dissimulate the acts committed by the counter-insurgency.|$|R

40|$|Algeria and the Islamist {{challenge}} For six years, Algeria {{has been}} experiencing a true nightmare of terror. Human rights organisations estimate that since 1992, 120 000 people were killed) by <b>armed</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>groups</b> or state security, among them many civilians. During Ramadan 1998, there were shocking news of cruelly executed and mutilated women, men {{and children in}} Koraa, 80 kilometres south-west of the capital Algiers. The alleged culprits were assumed {{to belong to the}} Groupe lslamique Armée (GIA). The critical Algerian press increasingly becomes a victim of fanaticism and state censorship 4. In order to understand these events better, it is necessary {{to take a look at}} the history of this country. In 1962, Algeria celebrated its independence from 132 years of colonial occupation by France. This great event was preceded by a long and bitter war, which was led by the Front De Libération Nationale (FLN), and its ally, the Armée de Libération Nationale (ALN). In 1954, Algerians began to fight the French army that was considered unbeatable. Its defeat was achieved in 1962, but the country was never exposed to democracy and pluralism because the FLN-leadership preferred to practice one-party-rule after the Soviet model. Critics, especially from the ranks of former freedom fighters, among them Mohamed Boudiaf and Hocine Ait Ahmeds, were arrested or forced to go into exile. </p...|$|R

Prior to his work, declarations of jihad in the twentieth century (such as against Israel) were essentially rhetorical and served more as a religious blessing of wars already declared and organized by secular bodies. But with his tireless travel and exhortation of activists, thousands of whom traveled to be trained and to fight in Afghanistan, what Azzam [...] "called for actually came about".|$|E
