50|$|In iconic phonetic notation, {{the shapes}} of the phonetic {{characters}} are designed so that they visually represent the position of articulators in the vocal tract. This is unlike <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation,</b> where the correspondence between character shape and articulator position is arbitrary. This notation is potentially more flexible than <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation</b> in showing more shades of pronunciation (MacMahon 1996:838-841). An example of iconic phonetic notation is the Visible Speech system, created by Scottish phonetician Alexander Melville Bell (Ellis 1869:15).|$|E
50|$|William of Volpiano's {{innovation}} of {{the notation}} system {{did not change}} the habits of central French neume notation, it just added an own <b>alphabetic</b> pitch <b>notation.</b> Often {{it was not clear}} how the letters refer to the neumes. Letter groups usually refer to the group of a ligature, but sometimes neumes were added as well to the letters to help the reading cantor for the coordination.|$|R
5000|$|One of William's {{innovations}} as a cantor and notator was an <b>alphabetic</b> pitch <b>notation.</b> Its {{point of}} reference was the Boethian diagramm, which displayed the double octave of the systema teleion in the diatonic (semitonium-tonus-tonus), the chromatic (semitonium-semitonium-trihemitonium), and the enharmonic tetrachord (diesis-diesis-ditonus). The different positions were represented by alphabetical letters, except the dieses which had special signs not unlike the tyronic letters used by Boethius: ...|$|R
50|$|This <b>alphabetic</b> pitch <b>notation</b> {{does not}} only offer {{insights}} into microtonal shifts {{used by the}} cantors of this local school, it also proves that the common projection of the piano keyboard on the medieval tone system is inadequate. Like many other letter systems used since the 8th century, also the system of William of Volpiano represented {{the positions of the}} Boethian diagramm, and the enharmonic signs used for the dieses represented not a change into another genus, but microtonal attractions within the diatonic melos of a certain mode.|$|R
50|$|The first {{division}} of the chant book is between the book's gradual (ff. 13r-155v) and an antiphonary fragment (ff. 156r-162v) which has the Matins for Palm Sunday, St. Blasius and St. Hylarius in the conventional liturgical order, but with tonal rubrics. The last leaf was added from another book to use the blank versoside for additions on the last pages written by other hands, chant notated in adiastematic neumes but without <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation</b> and even diastematic neumes with <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation</b> (ff. 160r-163r).|$|E
50|$|Another type of phonetic {{notation}} that is {{more precise}} than <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation</b> is analphabetic phonetic notation. Instead of both the alphabetic and iconic notational types' general principle of using one symbol per sound, analphabetic notation uses long sequences of symbols to precisely describe the component features of an articulatory gesture (MacMahon 1996:842-844). This type of notation {{is reminiscent of the}} notation used in chemical formulas to denote the composition of chemical compounds. Although more descriptive than <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation,</b> analphabetic notation is less practical for many purposes (e.g. for descriptive linguists doing fieldwork or for speech pathologists impressionistically transcribing speech disorders). As a result, this type of notation is uncommon.|$|E
50|$|William H. Baxter's {{transcription}} for Middle Chinese is an <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation</b> recording phonological {{information from}} medieval sources, {{rather than a}} reconstruction. It was introduced by Baxter as a reference point for his reconstruction of Old Chinese phonology.|$|E
25|$|In this {{approach}} the so-called earlier 'rhythmic' manuscripts of unheightened neumes that carry {{a wealth of}} melo-rhythmic information but not of exact pitches, are compared in large tables of comparison with relevant later 'melodic' manuscripts' that are written on lines or use double <b>alphabetic</b> and neumes <b>notation</b> over the text, but as a rule have less rhythmic refinement compared to the earlier group. However, the comparison {{between the two groups}} has made it possible to correct what are obvious mistakes. In other instances it is not so easy to find a consensus. In 1984 Chris Hakkennes published his own transcription of the Graduale Triplex. He devised a new graphic adaptation of square notation 'simplex' in which he integrated the rhythmic indications of the two most relevant sources, that of Laon and Skt. Gallen.|$|R
2500|$|A {{variety of}} issues have made {{agreement}} on a standardized orthography for the Igbo language difficult. In 1976, the Igbo Standardization Committee criticized the official orthography {{in light of the}} difficulty notating diacritic marks using typewriters and computers; difficulty in accurately representing tone with tone-marking conventions, as they are subject to change in different environments; and the inability to capture various sounds particular to certain Igbo dialects. Calls for reform have been based in part on the rogue use of <b>alphabetic</b> symbols, tonal <b>notations,</b> and spelling conventions that deviate from the standard orthography. The current Ọ́nwụ́ (...) alphabet, a compromise between the older Lepsius alphabet and a newer alphabet advocated by the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures (IIALC), is presented in the following table, with the International Phonetic Alphabet equivalents for the characters: ...|$|R

50|$|The {{style of}} William of Volpiano's tonary which follows, is unique, and Michel Huglo called {{it one of}} the finest tonaries which survived in the {{manuscript}} collections today. The scribe used red ink for the chant text and different colours to decorate its initials, while the neume and the <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation</b> was written in black ink.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the monastic}} reforms of Normandy William of Volpiano was an {{important}} protagonist among the local abbots, but his <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation</b> was only used over the following centuries in the Norman monasteries of his school, but never in the later Italo-Norman manuscripts which were rather influenced by the Aquitanian school (a few manuscripts used central French neumes, but without <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation).</b> Within the Cluniac Monastic Association, the cantors of the following generation like Adémar de Chabannes who was taught by his uncle Roger at Saint-Martial Abbey of Limoges (Aquitaine), developed a new diastematic neume notation which allowed to indicate the ligatures, {{even if they were}} separated by the vertical disposition according to their pitch class. His innovation was imitated by Italian cantors, first in Northern Italy than in other reform centres of the 11th century like Benevento and Monte Cassino. During the 12th century one are two lines were added to help the scribe and the reader for a constant vertical orientation.|$|E

Also not included are symbolic representations currently used for elements in other languages such as the Chinese characters for elements. Modern <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation</b> was introduced in 1814 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius.|$|E

40|$|This master's thesis {{examines}} {{the possibilities of}} correction and change in a classification scheme, {{with regard to the}} changes that occur in the world the classification system intends to describe. Applying a comparative method and classification theory, the classification of the example of the former Yugoslavia (1918 - 1941, 1945 - 1991), its republics and successor states, and the languages, formerly known as Serbo-Croatian are examined through a comparison of the main classes and divisions of language, geography, and history, in Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), and Klassifikationssystem för svenska bibliotek [Classification for Swedish Libraries] (SAB). Eight editions of DDC, from 1876 to 2014, are compared to seven editions of SAB, from 1921 to 2013. The editions have been selected in order to show the changes prior to, and following, the First World War, changes after the Second World War, and changes following the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1991. The examination shows that both systems have updated their editions according to the changes in former Yugoslavia over the years. DDC has well constructed facet schedules, especially Table 2 concerning geography, but fails, in some cases, to construct a logic and hierarchical structure for the republics and languages of Yugoslavia, partly due to the fixed classes and divisions that survive from the very first edition of DDC from 1876, but also {{as a result of the}} decimal notation, and its limitations, itself. SAB seeks to construct a hierarchically logic and equal scheme for the languages, areas, and states of the former Yugoslavia. Although the facets for geography and chronology aren't as developed as the ones in DDC, the overall result is that of a logically consistent and hierarchically clear classification, with short notation codes, thanks to the <b>alphabetic</b> mixed <b>notation,</b> which allows more subdivisions than the numerals and the pure notation of DDC. This study is a two years master's thesis in Archive, Library and Museum studies...|$|R
50|$|The third {{level of}} {{division}} are the eight parts {{according to the}} oktoechos {{in the order of}} autentus protus, plagi proti, autentus deuterus etc. In the first part, every tonal section has all introits according to the liturgical year cycle and then all communions according to the liturgical order. The whole disposition is not new, but it is identical with tonaries from different regions of the Cluniac Monastic Association. The only difference is, that every chant is not represented by an incipit, it is fully notated in neumes and in <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation</b> as well. Thanks to this manuscript, even cantors who do not know the chant, can memorize the melody together with its tonus.|$|E
50|$|The Antiphonary tonary missal of St. Benigne (also called Antiphonarium Codex Montpellier or Tonary of Saint-Bénigne of Dijon) was {{supposed}} to be written {{in the last years of}} the 10th century, when the Abbot William of Volpiano at St. Benignus of Dijon reformed the liturgy of several monasteries in Burgundy. The chant manuscript records mainly Western plainchant of the Roman-Frankish proper mass and part of the chant sung during the matins ("Gregorian chant"), but unlike the common form of the Gradual and of the Antiphonary, William organized his manuscript according to the chant genre (antiphons with psalmody, alleluia verses, graduals, offertories, and proses for the missal part), and these sections were subdivided into eight parts according to the octoechos. This disposition followed the order of a tonary, but William of Volpiano wrote not only the incipits of the classified chant, he wrote the complete chant text with the music in central French neumes which were still written in campo aperto, and added a second <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation</b> of his own invention for the melodic structure of the codified chant.|$|E
50|$|William's {{reform and}} its monastic {{foundations}} of Fécamp {{and the construction}} of the Abbey on the island of Mont Saint-Michel were not the first, {{and there were a lot}} of later abbots who founded monasteries not only in Normandy, but also in the conquered territories of Northern, and Southern Italy, including Arabian Sicily, after the Norman Kingdom was established in the conquered Island. His fully notated tonaries were only copied in Brittany and Normandy, the Norman-Sicilian manuscripts rather imitated the libellum structure of the Aquitanian troper-sequentiaries, and only a few of them (E-Mn 288, F-Pn lat. 10508) have survived with a tonary using central French neume notation, in its style very close to the chant books of Cluny. The «Bibliothèque interuniversitaire de Médecin» still conserves the only manuscript with <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation</b> which can be dated back to William's time. Thanks to the creative and innovative achievements of William as a cantor, reformer and architect, the local monasteries which he reformed, did not simply adapt to customs of the Cluniac reform, he contributed to the history of Norman chant his own local school which was as well inspired by elements of the local Norman tradition as by innovations of the Cluniac reform.|$|E
5000|$|The fully notated tonary {{which he}} wrote for St. Benignus (F-MOf H159), is {{following}} the order of other tonaries, which were created {{under the influence of}} the Cluniac Monastic Association. These tonaries usually had sections dedicated to the antiphonary and the gradual, within the gradual and the antiphonary there were subsections like the antiphons which were sung as refrains during psalm recitation (introits and communions), responsories (the introduction of epistle readings), but also other genres of the proper mass chant as alleluia verses (the introduction of gospels), and offertories (a soloistic processional antiphon for the procession of the gifts). Several Aquitanian troper-sequentiaries had a libellum structure which sorted the genres in separate books like alleluia verses (as the first part of sequentiaries and tractus collections), offertorials, and tropers. But William of Volpiano subdivided these books into eight parts according to the octoechos system like the tonary, or the troparia in the Byzantine book Octoechos, and within these sections the chant was ordered according to the cycle of the liturgical year starting with advent. He used the neumes of Cluny, the central French forms, without changing them, but he added an own system of <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation</b> in a second row, which defined the pitches of the melody precisely according to the Boethian diagramm. Like any other chant manuscript around 1000, the book was not written for a use during a ceremony, it was a [...] "book of memory" [...] for cantors who alone had the competence of reading and writing neumes, and the responsibility to organize the chant sung during the liturgical year. During his reforms, several Abbeys followed his example and his system was used by the teachers of the local grammar schools which included the daily practice of singing the liturgy.|$|E
40|$|International audienceEugène Jacquet {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} European scholars who made a comprehensive study of all the systems of numerical notation which were prevalent in India. In a pioneering paper published in 1830 he put together the scattered pieces of information then available in Europe and built up a large corpus of symbolic words employed in Sanskrit astronomical texts to represent numbers. He {{was one of the}} first scholars to realise that this system of word numerals used in Sanskrit texts spread outside India and was to be found in Tibet and Java. Jacquet also discussed the two variants of <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation</b> employed in astronomical texts, viz. the system designed and employed by Aryabhata in his Aryabhatia and the more widely used Katapayadi <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation.</b> The present article, after a brief outline of Jacquet’s life, introduces Jacquet’s paper on the numerical notations in India...|$|E
40|$|Pronunciation {{variation}} {{defies the}} capability of a strictly <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation</b> to fully characterize, as the basic parameters governing spoken language transcend the phoneme. The time scales required to accurately describe and model pronunciation are both shorter and longer than the phonetic segment, and are inherently wedded to the syllable. The specific properties of phonetic constituents are shaped by two inter-related parameters – prosodic prominence and their ordinal position within the syllable – which ultimately reflect the entropic potential associated with lexemic discriminability. The internal structure of the syllable can be parsimoniously portrayed in terms of articulatory features (e. g., voicing, place and manner of articulation, etc.) and used to characterize the microstructure of pronunciation variation. Parsing the utterance into syllabic units of variable prominence is essential for characterizing spoken language, and of utility for developing robust speech technology. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} makam {{descriptions}} {{goes back to}} Pre-Ottoman Empire period. In this period, makam phenomenon which is often studied in the middle age manuscripts of Islamic world was considered {{as a part of}} mathematic science. First Turkish music manuscripts had written in 15 th Century during Otoman period. This study is aimed to put forward how considered makam descriptions and classifications by author in this period. Eight manuscript have analyzed and compared with each other which are Arabic, Persian and ancient Turkish. It is seen that makams were described with short seyir (melodic development), makam circles and on the accord system of instruments in Turkish manuscripts which are written in 15 th century. These description ways are different more than Arabic and Persian manuscripts. Makams were described with <b>alphabetic</b> <b>notation</b> gave their scale and interval in those manuscripts. There are also some differences with regard to makam classifications between these two schools. It is concluded that Ladikli Mehmet Çelebi who is one of this period’s aouthor improved an characteristic makam description synthesizing each two description way...|$|E
