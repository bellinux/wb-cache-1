5|$|Immunity (or, more accurately, tolerance) to P.falciparum malaria {{does occur}} naturally, {{but only in}} {{response}} to years of repeated infection. An individual can be protected from a P.falciparum infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry {{a version of the}} parasite rendered non-infective by <b>a</b> <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> X-ray irradiation. The highly polymorphic nature of many P.falciparum proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design. Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito. Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have been inadequate on their own. For example, SPf66 was tested extensively in areas where the disease is common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.|$|E

5|$|The {{toxic dose}} of {{paracetamol}} is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity.

Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24hours exceed these levels. Following a normal dose of 1gram of paracetamol {{four times a day}} for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value.

In tanks in which control tadpoles {{were placed in}} contact with tadpoles that were previously housed in tritiated water (3. 0 × 104 Bq/L), the cells from all animals responded {{as though they were}} “adapted”. This suggests that direct exposure to 3. 0 × 104 Bq/L tritium contributes to an increased resistance to <b>a</b> high <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> radiation in liver cells. It also suggests that being in contact with tadpoles that were previously exposed to 3. 0 × 104 Bq/L tritium (bystander effect) contributes to an increased resistance to <b>a</b> high <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> radiation in liver cells. In vitro exposures were also conducted using primary cultures of liver cells obtained from an unexposed-non-bystander tadpole. In these control cells, it was observed that exposure to 100 mGy of 60 Co gamma radiation (delivered at <b>a</b> <b>dose</b> rate <b>of</b> 5 mGy/min) did not affect the micronucleus frequency whereas exposure to 4 Gy (delivered at <b>a</b> <b>dose</b> rate <b>of</b> about 10. 2 Gy/min) increased the micronucleus frequency. Prior exposure to <b>a</b> low <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> 60 Co gamma radiation (100 mGy delivered at <b>a</b> <b>dose</b> rate <b>of</b> 5 mGy/min) induced an adaptive response, protecting the cells from harm caused by exposure to subsequent high <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> 60 Co gamma radiation (4 Gy delivered at <b>a</b> <b>dose</b> rate <b>of</b> about 10. 2 Gy/min). Using the adaptive response (determined using micronucleus assay) as a biomarker, the data obtained suggest that bystander effects do play a role in wild populations since bullfrog tadpoles that were not exposed to tritium responded like the tadpoles that were directly exposed to tritium after being placed in contact with them. 1...|$|R
