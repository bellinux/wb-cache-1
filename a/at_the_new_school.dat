5|$|John Cage and Marcel Duchamp were {{significant}} influences on Ono's art. She learned of Cage at Sarah Lawrence and met {{him through his}} student Ichiyanagi Toshi in Cage's legendary experimental composition class <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>School</b> for Social Research: She was thus introduced to more of Cage's unconventional neo-Dadaism first hand and his New York City protégés Allan Kaprow, Brecht, Mac Low, Al Hansen and the poet Dick Higgins.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau studied music <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>School,</b> and toured and {{recorded}} while still a student. He {{was a member}} of saxophonist Joshua Redman's Quartet with bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade in the mid-1990s, and has led his own trio since the early 1990s. His first long-term trio featured bassist Larry Grenadier and drummer Jorge Rossy; in 2005 Jeff Ballard replaced Rossy. These bands have released a dozen albums under the pianist's name.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Mehldau {{moved to}} New York City in 1988 to study jazz and {{contemporary}} music <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>School.</b> He studied under pianists Fred Hersch, Junior Mance and Kenny Werner, and drummer Jimmy Cobb. In 1989 Mehldau {{was part of}} saxophonist Christopher Hollyday's band that toured for several months; {{as a result of}} playing so often with one group, Mehldau was able to assimilate the music of Wynton Kelly and McCoy Tyner, his two principal influences on piano up to that point, and began to develop his own sound. Before the age of 20 Mehldau also had gigs in Cobb's band, along with fellow student Peter Bernstein on guitar.|$|E

50|$|Elois W. Jenssen {{was born}} in Palo Alto, California.

5|$|In mid-1945, {{after the}} end of World War II in Europe, he was in Germany with the U. S. Strategic Bombing Survey, {{studying}} the effects of Allied bombing on German morale, an experience that affected his postwar work as his visit to Spain had affected him earlier. On his return, he settled in Manhattan, working as a freelance writer, a lecturer <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>School</b> for Social Research, and a visiting professor at Bennington, Smith, and other American colleges. In 1946 he became a naturalised citizen of the US.|$|E
5|$|Jesse is Jewish and {{was brought}} up in a secular Jewish family that {{originated}} in Poland and Ukraine. He attended the East Brunswick Public Schools at Frost School, Hammarskjold Middle School, Churchill Junior High School, and spent his sophomore year at East Brunswick High School. Eisenberg then transferred to the High School of Performing Arts in New York. When he was a senior, he received his breakthrough role in the independent comedy-drama film Roger Dodger. His work in the film prevented Eisenberg from enrolling at New York University. Instead, Eisenberg would go on to study anthropology and contemporary architecture <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>School</b> in Greenwich Village, where he majored in liberal arts, with a concentration in democracy and cultural pluralism.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{lost his}} {{position}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>School</b> in May 1941 after writing to its director, Alvin Johnson, {{to say he}} had saved several lives in secret experiments with the accumulator. Johnson was aware of Reich's claims that he could cure cancer, and told him the New School was not an appropriate institution for the work. Reich was also evicted from Kessel Street after his neighbours complained about the animal experiments. His supporters, including Walter Briehl, gave him $14,000 to buy a house, and he settled into 9906 69th Avenue.|$|E

5|$|After Cage {{finished}} teaching <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>School</b> in {{the summer}} of 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found a cheap loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street that she used as a studio and living space. Supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society, Ono allowed composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft. Both began organizing a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961, with people such as Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim attending, and both Ono and Young claimed to have been the primary curator of these events, with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young. The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including Painting to Be Stepped On, which was a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} the visa in August 1939 and sailed out of Norway on 19 August on the SS Stavangerfjord, the last ship {{to leave for}} the United States before the war began on 3 September. He began teaching <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>School,</b> where he remained until May 1941, living first at 7502 Kessel Street, Forest Hills, Queens, where he conducted experiments on mice with cancer, injecting them with bions. He built a small Faraday cage to examine the vapors and lights he said the bions were producing. In October 1939 his secretary Gertrud Gaasland introduced him to Ilse Ollendorf, 29 years old at the time. Reich was still in love with Lindenberg, but Ollendorf started organizing his life for him, becoming his bookkeeper and laboratory assistant. They began living together in the Kessel Street house on Christmas Day 1939. She was eight weeks pregnant, but according to Turner he insisted that she have an abortion. Five years later, in 1944, they had a son, Peter, and were married in 1946.|$|E
