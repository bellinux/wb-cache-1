50|$|Some systems disable {{alternator}} field (rotor) power during {{wide open}} throttle conditions. Disabling the field reduces <b>alternator</b> <b>pulley</b> mechanical loading to nearly zero, maximizing crankshaft power. In this case the battery supplies all primary electrical power.|$|E
5000|$|The high {{nickel content}} block had a thicker deck, and a taller intake {{manifold}} {{due to the}} heads. It also had a distinct harmonic balancer, crankcase windage tray, bigger diameter <b>alternator</b> <b>pulley</b> (from the 289HIPO), and bigger diameter power steering pulley all to accommodate the higher RPM capabilities of the engine vs a standard 302. The engine also came with an engine RPM limiter (to protect the owner's warranty options but was often {{one of the first}} things removed). The Boss 302 has eight valve cover bolts; in '69 they were chrome and in '70 cast aluminum, while the standard 302 has six. The connecting rods are the same as used in the 289 HIPO, and have an engineering number of C3AE-D on them. They are capable of higher RPMs than standard 302 rods (up to ~8k RPM), aided by a spot face for 3/8 inch bolts with a unique football-shaped head (vs 5/16 for standard small blocks), and beefier cap. The crankshaft is cross drilled (this was changed in 1970 for better reliability) high strength steel forging. The cam and lifters are high lift, solid mechanical units. The cam featured 290 degrees duration and [...]477 inches of lift.|$|E
