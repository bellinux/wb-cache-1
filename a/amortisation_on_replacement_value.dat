50|$|There are {{the three}} types of {{insurance}} coverage. Replacement cost coverage pays the cost of repairing or replacing your property with like kind & quality regardless of depreciation or appreciation. Premiums for this type of coverage are based <b>on</b> <b>replacement</b> cost <b>values,</b> and not based on actual cash value. Actual cash value coverage provides for replacement cost minus depreciation. Extended replacement cost will pay over the coverage limit if the costs for construction have increased. This generally will not exceed 25% of the limit. When you obtain an insurance policy, the limit is the maximum amount of benefit the insurance company will pay for a given situation or occurrence. Limits also include the ages below or above what an insurance company will not issue a new policy or continue a policy.|$|R
25|$|With the {{election}} of Margaret Thatcher in 1979 the water and sanitation sector initially remained public, but the government attempted to make the enterprises operate more along commercial lines. As a result, {{the number of employees}} in the sector declined from 61,000 in 1976 to 52,000 in 1985, real operating costs declined, tariffs were increased above the inflation rate and the share of self-financing of investments increased. However, government regulators also cut back on investments. While the industry became profitable, the rate of return on assets based <b>on</b> <b>replacement</b> cost <b>values</b> remained low at less than 2%. As part of the attempt to commercialise the service providers, the Water Act 1983 reduced the number of Board members of the water authorities. However, it also eliminated the local government representation on the Boards and made all Board members appointed by Ministers, thus further centralising the sector.|$|R

The objective of this research was to evaluate the irrigation requirements of ten newly established cool-season turfgrass species maintained under two different mowing height and nitrogen fertility regimes. The site was treated with glyphosate to eliminate existing plant material, scalped to remove foliage, leveled, and graded to provide adequate surface drainage. All plots were seeded with a blend of three cultivars for all turfgrass species (Kentucky bluegrass, perennial ryegrass, velvet bentgrass, creeping bentgrass, colonial bentgrass, strong creeping red fescue, chewings fescue, slender creeping red fescue, tall fescue) except for annual bluegrass which was sodded. Plots were mowed at 1. 6 and 5. 1 cm three times and one time per week respectively. Nitrogen was applied at either 0. 45 or 1. 81 kg per 92. 9 m 2 per year.

The paper presents the level and structure of equipment of the selected organic farms with farm buildings and their <b>replacement</b> <b>value</b> and operating costs were calculated. The scope of research included 50 facilities located in the southern Poland, which were granted an organic farm certificate. The investigated facilities were the object of research within the development subsidy titled "Innovative influence of technology and information management supporting system on production efficiency in organic farms". The analysed data concerned 2012. For the purpose of comparative analysis the researched facilities were divided into two groups which specialize in plant and animal production. Average area of buildings was 314. 45 m 2 and was comparable in distinguished trend groups. In farms producing plants, storehouses prevailed and in case of animal farms – livestock buildings. Average annual <b>replacement</b> <b>value</b> of buildings was PLN 105. 78 thousand and was also comparable in trend groups. In the structure of <b>replacement</b> <b>value,</b> storehouses prevailed, which constituted at the average 43. 03 % and livestock buildings – 37. 68 %. Average annual operating costs of buildings were PLN 58. 61 thousand. The fact that these costs in animal farms were 2 times higher than in plant farms, should be emphasised.
