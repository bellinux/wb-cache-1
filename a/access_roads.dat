5|$|Meanwhile, Crawley Borough Council began {{discussions with}} {{neighbouring}} Horsham District Council in 2006 {{in connection with}} a proposed neighbourhood west of Bewbush; such development would straddle the boundary of the two local authorities. Planning permission was granted in March 2011, the name Kilnwood Vale was adopted, and in October 2011 Crawley Borough Council sold for £3 million some areas of land required for the construction of <b>access</b> <b>roads.</b> Work on the five-phase scheme started in October 2012. Up to 2,500 houses, a school, library, supermarket and other facilities will be provided.|$|E

5|$|Transportation {{was greatly}} {{affected}} by the hurricane, as well. The rainfall left 70% of the roads unusable or destroyed and greatly damaged 92bridges. Over 1,700miles (2700km) of highways or <b>access</b> <b>roads</b> needed replacement subsequent to the storm, especially {{in the northern part}} of the country and along portions of the Pan-American Highway. Total transportation damage amounted to $300million (1998USD). Agricultural losses were significant, including the deaths of 50,000 animals, mostly bovines. Crops and fisheries were affected greatly as well, and, combined with agricultural losses, damage totaled to $185million (1998USD).|$|E
5|$|Others {{argue that}} while the issues of {{increasing}} public costs are real, the importance of continued growth of OHSU for the city's economy must be factored in as well. Not only is it the largest employer in the city, but OHSU is an important and effective vehicle to attract both federal funding, totaling more than 168million dollars for 2005, and a highly skilled workforce to the area. The growth in the current campus on the Marquam Hill is limited by <b>access</b> <b>roads</b> and parking, an expansion of which would likely cause more dramatic harm to the surrounding communities.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the project and the other operational and maintenance purposes, a 3.5 km long new <b>access</b> <b>road</b> was built from powerhouse location to the forebay location. The <b>access</b> <b>road</b> starts from Adavikanda where the power house is built-up. The end point is Warangal; the Forebay location. By {{the construction of the}} <b>access</b> <b>road,</b> the requirement of accessing to the weir, penstock path, forebay and channel was fulfilled.Since the path is along the part of a highland complex of the country and 3.5 km long path climbs an elevation of 460m, it consists of steep valleys, rock cliffs, boulders and boulder trains. And also slope directions and slope angles vary considerably from place to place due to the inherent nature of the area. Therefore, it was a hard task to complete the <b>access</b> <b>road</b> and the construction of the <b>access</b> <b>road</b> too a period of 8 months.|$|R
5|$|Although {{identified}} {{early as}} a vital strategic outpost, Port Moresby, the most significant Papuan town, had just two airfields and basic port facilities in early 1942. An enormous amount of work was required to transform it into a major base for both air and land operations against the Japanese. This {{was done in the}} face of frequent Japanese air raids. During the course of the Kokoda Track campaign, the two original airfields were improved, and five new airfields were developed. To make them operational, the engineers had to construct more than just runways; taxiways, hardstands, facilities and <b>access</b> <b>roads</b> all had to be built. The operation of the base depended on shipping, but the port facilities were limited. To increase the capacity of the port, a causeway was built to Tatana Island, where pontoon docks were emplaced. Engineers also built roads, warehouses, and a water treatment plant. They ran the town's electricity and water supply, and quarried stone for the roads and airstrips.|$|E
5|$|Both the Dodgers and Braves {{finished}} the regularly scheduled 154-game season tied with records of 86–68, forcing a tie-breaker {{to decide the}} pennant winner. The two teams' managers flipped a coin to decide home field advantage and Dodgers' manager Walt Alston won. The Dodgers opted to play {{the second and third}} (if necessary) games at home, choosing to play Game 1 in Milwaukee. The tie-breaker was scheduled for the 28th, 29th, and the 30th if necessary, which required moving the start of the World Series from September 30 to October 1. The Giants' falling out of the pennant race avoided a potentially disruptive situation involving their home field. Candlestick Park was under construction during the 1959 season and the Giants would not begin play there until 1960. However, Giants vice president Chub Feeney had said earlier in the season that if the Giants won the pennant they would play their World Series home games in Candlestick. Several potential problems were suggested with this move including a lack of seating, lack of toilet facilities, and insufficient <b>access</b> <b>roads</b> to the stadium.|$|E
5|$|Nordberg {{was part}} of Holmenkolbanen's {{operating}} network until 1975, when the municipality of Oslo bought all the company's stock. In the early 1990s, the stations on the Sognsvann Line were upgraded to metro standard, which involves a heightening and lengthening of the platforms, installation of third rail power supply and a new signaling system. The third rail {{made it impossible to}} cross the line in-grade, and under- or overpasses had to be built at all stations. The transport authorities decided to close Nordberg, arguing that the <b>access</b> <b>roads</b> to the station were steep and dangerous, and icy during the winter. The residents of Nordberg opposed the closure of the station, arguing that it had served the area well with its central position in the area. Nevertheless, the station was closed, along with the level crossing that formerly had allowed for car traffic to cross the tracks. An underpass for pedestrians was constructed.|$|E

5|$|Since {{construction}} of the highway, three interchanges have been added or expanded. The first addition was an interchange with View High Drive, which was constructed in early 1993 costing about $2million to complete. The second was an addition to the existing cloverleaf at US50 in Lee's Summit, adding <b>access</b> <b>roads</b> to Pryor Road and Northwest Blue Parkway. Construction on that interchange began in July 2007, and was completed by September 2008. The third interchange, with Strother Road was first planned to be constructed in 2008. The road served {{to provide access to}} the industrial park west of the freeway, and to spur new development on land pending sale by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to the east of the freeway. The interchange was opened to traffic in August 2010 at a final construction cost of around $18million.|$|E
5|$|The Sagtikos State Parkway {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with the Southern and Heckscher state parkways in the hamlet of West Islip, {{just north of}} the Robert Moses Causeway's junction with the Southern State Parkway. Heading southbound, this junction is signed as exitS4. The parkway proceeds northward through the town of Islip as a four-lane divided highway, passing through residential parts of the adjacent hamlet of Brentwood to reach exitS3, a partial cloverleaf interchange with Pine Aire Drive. Just north of the junction, the highway passes over the Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road. Continuing northward through Islip, the Sagtikos Parkway leaves Brentwood ahead of exitS2, a connection to County Route13 (CR13, named Crooked Hill Road). The southbound exit serves CR13 by way of <b>access</b> <b>roads</b> through the Pilgrim Psychiatric Center while the northbound direction uses part of G Road to reach CR13 and Suffolk County Community College's Grant Campus.|$|E
5|$|The first {{suggestions}} for a stadium at Ullevaal were launched {{by members of}} Lyn in 1917, but not until 1924 was a committee appointed {{to look into the}} matter. Lyn had also considered building their stadium at Holmenkollåsen, Hoff, Tåsen, Frogner, Berg and Marienlyst. The club made an agreement with the tram operator Akersbanerne to purchase land they had acquired as part of the construction of the Sognsvann Line. It was decided that a limited company was to be established, with a share capital of NOK100,000. Aker Municipality agreed to purchase 30% and partially pay via <b>access</b> <b>roads</b> and utilities. All sports clubs in Aker were given the right to purchase up to 10% of the shares, while the rest was to be bought by Lyn. Any costs exceeding the capital was to be paid for through loans and donations. At the same time, Lyn acquired land to build a training field which they would own themselves and was estimated to cost NOK20,000. Both plans were passed by the club annual meeting on 23 May 1924.|$|E

5|$|Wilkins Peak {{is a small}} {{mountain}} {{located in}} Sweetwater County, Wyoming, between the cities of Green River and Rock Springs. It is primarily used for radio and television station transmitters, but it also serves radio needs of the FAA, EMS, and local businesses such as Questar Gas. In 2003, a tower on the peak was knocked down by a vehicle delivering propane to customers. The tower was owned by Wyoming Public Radio and was serving the local area with programming from National Public Radio. There are numerous <b>access</b> <b>roads</b> to the peak {{and it is not}} gated and open year-round, weather permitting. Along with the radio uses, the mountain is also a popular location for mountain biking and hiking. The mountain contains geology typical of its location in southwestern Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|Extending {{the line}} through the Sunnyside Yard and onto the LIRR Montauk Branch, running {{directly}} to the lower level of the Archer Avenue Line in Jamaica. The Montauk Branch in Queens is currently used for freight service, last seeing passenger service in 1998, {{and would have been}} rebuilt and electrified. The Montauk line would merge with the BMT Jamaica elevated at Lefferts Boulevard just west of 121st Street, using the BMT approach to the Archer Avenue subway. The Jamaica El would truncated to Crescent Street in Brooklyn and replaced by bus service. New stations would be built at Thomson Avenue within the Sunnyside Yard, and at Fresh Pond Road (the site of the former Fresh Pond station) and Woodhaven Boulevard (at the former Ridgewood station site) along the Montauk Branch. The now-closed Richmond Hill station on the Montauk Branch would be renovated and lengthened for subway service. The LIRR would have exclusive use of the tracks during overnight hours for freight service. This $594 million option would be open by 1997, but people living around the Montauk Branch opposed the proposal due to fears of increased traffic and danger from the Montauk Branch's multiple grade crossings, though plans called for new overpasses and <b>access</b> <b>roads</b> to eliminate these crossings.|$|E
5|$|Mount Adams is the second-most isolated, {{in terms}} of access, {{stratovolcano}} in Washington; Glacier Peak is the most isolated. Only two major highways pass close to it. Highway 12 passes about 25 {{miles to the north}} of Adams through the Cascades. Highway 141 comes within 13 miles of Adams as it follows the White Salmon River valley up from the Columbia River to the small town of Trout Lake. From either highway, travelers have to use Forest Service roads to get closer to the mountain. The main <b>access</b> <b>roads,</b> FR 23, FR 82, FR 80, and FR 21, are paved for part of their length. Most all other roads are gravel or dirt, with varying degrees of maintenance. Access to the Mount Adams Recreation Area is by way of FR 82, which becomes BIA 285 at the Yakama reservation boundary. BIA 285 is known to be extremely rough and often suitable only for trucks or high-clearance vehicles.
