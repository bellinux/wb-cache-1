40|$|This book {{chapter is}} closed access. Drawing Ambiguity builds upon its predecessors, Drawing Now: Between the Lines of Contemporary Art, 2007 and Hyperdrawing: Beyond the Lines of Contemporary Art, 2012, by proposing that a {{position}} of ambiguity, a lack of definition, is not only desirable within fine art drawing but also necessary - having the capacity to enable and sustain drawing practices. What happens if we <b>are</b> <b>ambivalent</b> <b>to</b> what <b>is</b> drawing, or what drawing is? The editors Russell Marshall and Phil Sawdon bring together seven invited contributions to offer multiple perspectives from within and without the fine art drawing field to respond to these questions. Each contributor was offered the opportunity to acknowledge ambiguity within drawing as creatively informed by three overarching themes: William Empson’s Seven Types of Ambiguity in literary prose, the logical fallacies of ambiguity, and grammatical prepositions...|$|R
50|$|The {{lines were}} now drawn {{for a show}} down between Buganda and the Central government. Historians may argue about whether {{this could have been}} avoided through compromise. This was {{unlikely}} as Obote now felt emboldened and saw the Kabaka as weak. Indeed, by accepting the presidency four years earlier and siding with the UPC, the Kabaka had divided his people and taken the side of one against the other. Within Buganda’s political institutions, rivalries driven by religion and personal ambition made the institutions ineffective and unable to respond to the central government moves. The Kabaka was often regarded as aloof and unresponsive to advice from the younger Buganda politicians who better understood the new post-Independence politics, unlike the traditionalists who <b>were</b> <b>ambivalent</b> <b>to</b> what <b>was</b> going on as long as their traditional benefits were maintained.

40|$|Ambivalent {{pictures}} offer several {{interpretations of}} different valence-e. g., some photographs by Claudia Otto document scenes {{which can be}} perceived as sad or happy, dangerous or sweet, and so on. We show that task experiences influence the experienced valence of these images. Previous work already documented that responses <b>to</b> images <b>are</b> task-dependent and self-created insights heighten pleasure. A resulting positive mood and high self-efficacy might broaden attention to positive valence. In contrast, low self-efficacy leads {{to the prediction of}} negative task experiences and strengthens the salience of a positive experience. In our study, participants rated the valence of <b>ambivalent</b> photographs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more positive after positive feedback regarding the accomplishment of a precedent puzzle. We revealed a trend of positive feedback being more effective when it followed negative experiences.

40|$|Of English {{writers of}} the early nineteenth century, none has so {{sustained}} and well-documented an engagement with Spinozan metaphysics as Coleridge. Encountering Spinoza's monism both indirectly, through works contributing to the pantheism controversy of the 1790 s, and directly, in intensive study of a collected edition of Spinoza's works in 1812 - 13, Coleridge repeatedly identified the Dutch philosopher with Christianity, particularly in his personal conduct, while deploring the moral implications of his supposed denial of free will. This <b>ambivalent</b> response <b>to</b> Spinoza <b>is</b> reflective of a fundamental and persistent tension in Coleridge's own thought between his attraction to a metaphysical monism, {{as the basis for}} postulating the unity of subject and object, and his desire to affirm Trinitarian Christianity...|$|R
40|$|Although {{not always}} {{included}} among his intellectual sources, {{there is a}} notorious platonism in the philosophical reflection of Oakeshott, attributable {{to the influence of}} British neohegelianism.

In this article, Oakeshott's <b>ambivalent</b> relation <b>to</b> platonism <b>is</b> explored, as is recognized in the particular reinterpretation of the cave allegory contained in On human conduct. In the return to the cave, our interpretation of Oakeshott not only recognizes a critique of the rationalist's claims in politics, but also an invitation to explore the meeting of the different modes of the human imagination and a defense of the relevance of “the voice of poetry in the conversation of mankind...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Boston UniversityThis was a {{comparative}} study of seven families that accepted treatment and seven families that refused treatment. The study focused {{on the relationship of}} parental attitudes in the initial interviews to the subsequent acceptance of treatment. The following areas were examined {{in order to understand the}} dynamics of clinic involvement: descriptive characteristics, family background, history of the problem, source of referral, parental attitudes toward the child, parental attitudes toward the problem, parental attitudes toward the clinic and the nature of termination. This study was conducted at the Providence Child Guidance Clinic in Providence, Rhode Island. The factors that <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> most related <b>to</b> the acceptance of treatment were parental attitudes toward the child, toward the problem and toward the clinic. Parental attitudes in relation to clinic involvement tended to form a configuration.

This paper draws on findings from two primarily qualitative studies of young people's sexual practices and understandings: the Women, Risk and AIDS Project and the Men, Risk and AIDS Project. The paper suggest that for young men, first (hetero) sex is an empowering moment through which agency and identity are confirmed. For young women the moment of first (hetero) sex is more complicated, and their <b>ambivalent</b> responses <b>to</b> it <b>are</b> primarily concerned with managing loss. By exploring and contrasting young people's accounts of their first sexual experiences and the meanings that virginity hold for them, the paper reveals the asymmetry of desire, agency and control within (hetero) sex.

40|$|This essay {{discusses}} {{the historical and}} textual representations of piracy {{in the writings of}} Hugo Grotius, primarily De Indis/De iure praedae(1603 - 1608) and the Commentarius in Theses XI (c. 1600. Contrary to popular belief, Grotius, in stark contrast <b>to</b> Jean Bodin, <b>was</b> not an advocate of the constitutionally homogenous Nation-State. Rather, his central concept of divisible sovereignty, the lynchpin of the constitutional theory of his early writings, unambiguously presents us with the object of the heterogeneousState. In Grotian theory, the State may be “read” as a composite construction, with a residual degree of inalienable sovereignty accruing at each unit-level. Even if only unconsciously, Grotius describes a concurrent para-political sub-division of the state between institutional Government (the “magistrates”) and civil society, one that constitutes an operational system of governance within the Nation-State. Like his contemporary Johannes Althusius, Grotius’theory allows for the emergence of a wholly “private,” albeit lawful, mode of authority. This is most apparent in Grotius’ treatment of the mercantile trading Company and its Privateering operations. The corporatist theory of sovereignty permits the Company’s private agents of violence, the legally <b>ambivalent</b> Privateer/Pirate, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> invested with a requisite degree of sovereignty. The Grotian theory of divisible sovereignty, investing the seventeenth-century Pirate band with legal personality, serves as a vital historical precursor to the quasi-statist (trans-) national criminal cartels of the twenty-first century. The Grotian Pirate/Privateer/Just Avenger, therefore, is a “nomad”: a liminal entity that simultaneously transverses both geographical and juro-political spaces, rendering him or herselfin-determinable...|$|R

40|$|To {{review the}} history of the Gothic as a counter-Enlightenment discourse, albeit an <b>ambivalent</b> one, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> see the suitability, if not the inevitability, of the Gothic {{treatment}} of education and educators. Presumably benign institutions, schools may seem more like unfeeling bureaucracies, brainwashing factories, militaristic zones, or lawless waste lands. Ostensibly democratizing, leveling meritocracies that create conditions for social mobility and prepare students for citizenship in an egalitarian nation, American schools nevertheless remain resistant to democracy and often reproduce rather than challenge the existing class structure. They may, therefore, appear frustratingly classless to the elite and forbiddingly or tantalizingly aristocratic to the middle or working classes. Such tensions animate two works of the Schoolhouse Gothic, Edgar Allan Poe’s “William Wilson” (1839) and Donna Tartt’s The Secret History (1991), texts whose protagonists emerge from school damaged and dangerous, texts in which the promise of democratizing education becomes a grimly parodic threat...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Agonistic {{behavior}} in male Japanese quail, shown by aggressive pecking after feed restriction, was potentiated in unstable groups (a visitor bird {{moved to a}} new cage containing an unfamiliar resident each 24 -hr period) but not in stable (a pair that was never changed once the birds were placed in cages) groups. The resident quail were more aggressive than either visitors or individuals of the stable groups. Ambivalent behavior (behavior characterized by an aggressive action followed immediately by a submissive posture) during feeding competition was observed in both the unstable and stable groupings. The <b>ambivalent</b> behavior appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a conditioned response and was probably a result of the motivation to feed after a period of feed deprivation. During the experimental period the stable pairs of quail gained 28 % of their initial body weight, but the resident and visitor quail, which were in the unstable grouping, gained only 15 and 13 %, respectively. The differences in percentage weight gain were significant. Paired testes weights of the resident and visitor quail were significantly less than those of the stable birds...|$|R
