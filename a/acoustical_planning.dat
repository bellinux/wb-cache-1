The main goals of the END are to make a diagnosis of noise pollution in Europe {{that can lead to}} action plans, and a noise management that can be implemented in terms of action plans and <b>acoustical</b> <b>planning.</b> The term 'strategic' is very important in this definition, because the management of environmental noise must be made for the long-term in a full area. Using a simile, we should not worry about the weather, but we must care about the global warming.|$|E
30|$|Archaeoacoustical {{data from}} the central {{platform}} at Huánuco Pampa offer some interesting directions for future research, although our results do not represent all Inca platforms. Repeating this methodology at other Inca platforms could generate perspectives on how widespread Inca <b>acoustical</b> <b>planning</b> was, as well as where different designs appear. Further experimental work could be carried out to address the acoustical properties of the interiors of Inca buildings, and our preliminary work at Huánuco Pampa could be extended by new measurements and observations when large crowds are present, such as during the annual July festival. Finally, the work reported here offers methods and interpretive framing that could be useful for archaeoacoustical work elsewhere. Our results suggest that acoustical design could {{be an important factor}} in the communication strategies of state elites, and sound valued as a means for ordinary people to provide information to their Inca rulers.|$|E
40|$|A growing {{attention}} has been devoted recently to acoustical problems on board of vessels, particularly {{in connection with the}} construction of an increasing number of high standard cruise vessels and pleasure crafts. Severe specifications on maximum noise levels on board, in particular in working, living, and resting areas are now common, reflecting into the need for a careful <b>acoustical</b> <b>planning</b> since the very first steps of the design. This approach implies in general a detailed analysis of the various elements of the “acoustic circuit” with identification and characterisation of the sources present on board, of receiving positions (location and required limits) and of transmission paths connecting them. In principle, actions on any of these elements are possible, but not always they all are practically feasible: in any case the strategy to be adopted should be chosen since the beginning, in order to have the maximum flexibility in the solutions: “a posteriori” actions are often incomplete, uneconomical, and can bring a considerable increase in weight. The present work aims at defining the physical meaning of the various elements of noise transmission and the way of acting on them...|$|E
40|$|The word "Acoustical Improvement Plan" {{indicates}} {{a set of}} provisions, related to land management and suitable to reach the targets defined in the planning, with particular reference to acoustical standards satisfaction. The <b>acoustical</b> improvement <b>plan</b> {{could be interpreted as}} a loosening of the most critical nodes checked by the comparison between the noise mapping and the acoustical characterisation of a territory, but this interpretation couldn't reply to the most diffused question of acoustical quality. This condition derives by an approach founded on a multiplicity of actions and provisions, able to implement new logics in decisional processes, that determines the territory planning and manages the transformation, with a particular attention to environmental noise problems. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the plan identity, which isn't represented by a specific planning action, but it invests and interests in particular actions of all politics of planning and territorial management, involving therefore the necessity to coordinate and to interact with the main instruments of territorial management. The <b>acoustical</b> improvement <b>plan</b> won't be the design of the intervention aimed to restore the sound levels limits, but a process, structured as a set of provisions and principles of urban planning and government of the territory, with the purpose to re-establish acceptable acoustic conditions for the critical zones, but also in order to prevent eventual future sufferin...|$|R
40|$|Noise {{is derived}} from the Latin word “nausea” {{implying}} ‘unwanted sound’ or ‘sound that is loud, unpleasant or unexpected’. The noise originates from human activities, especially the urbanization and the development of transport and industry. The passive method is a simple approach which includes the use of absorbers, barriers to reduce the interior noise in an enclosure. For enclosure structures on passive vibration noise control, the vibration and the noise are reduced either by adding appropriate passive elements or by modifying the system. It also can use the method to reduce noise such as <b>acoustical</b> site <b>planning,</b> architectural design, construction method and barrier construction. With use the soundproof window will reduce noise levels by 75 - 95...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Adaptive {{sampling}} aims {{to predict}} the types and locations of additional observations that are most useful for specific objectives, under {{the constraints of the}} available observing network. Path planning refers to the computation of the routes of the assets {{that are part of the}} adaptive component of the observing network. In this paper, we present two path planning methods based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). The methods are illustrated with some examples based on environmental ocean fields and compared to highlight their strengths and weaknesses. The stronger method is further demonstrated on a number of examples covering multi-vehicle and multi-day path planning, based on simulations for the Monterey Bay region. The framework presented is powerful and flexible enough to accommodate changes in scenarios. To demonstrate this feature, <b>acoustical</b> path <b>planning</b> is also discussed. I...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn room <b>acoustical</b> <b>planning</b> it is {{important}} to obtain realistic impulse responses from simulations to calculate the well-known room acoustical parameters as reverberation time, clarity etc. In most cases this is done by using a hybrid implementation of ray-tracing and mirror image sources. This paper presents a method adopted from the field of seismic imaging, which is based on the concept of wave field extrapolation. The advantage of modelling with the full wave character of sound propagation is that all physical phenomena can be simulated correctly (i. e. diffraction). The proposed algorithm uses a sequence of matrix multiplications that represent generalized spatial convolutions. The matrices give ample insight in the physical processes, like: propagation, non-locally reacting (complex) reflection properties, absorption and directivity of source(s) and receiver(s). The algorithm is theoretically able to solve for an infinite number of reflections. A comparison is made with conventional methods. Therefore, a simple rectangular room with uniform walls and a three-dimensional configuration of an L-shaped wall, placed in an anechoic environment, are simulated. The plate is firstly covered with a hard surface and secondly with a non-locally reacting absorber...|$|E
40|$|A growing {{attention}} {{has been devoted to}} acoustical problems on board of ships, particularly in connection with the recent, extensive production of high standard cruise vessels. Severe specifications on the maximum noise levels in the various areas of the ship and in particular in the living and working areas are now common. This brought the need, since the first steps of the design, for a careful <b>acoustical</b> <b>planning,</b> based on a detailed analysis of the various elements of the “acoustic circuit”. This approach implies in general to consider sources on board (power and location), transmission paths and receiving positions. The work concentrates on the final part of the transmission path and regards the anti-noise measures that are utilised for the cabin walls (particularly on the floor) to reduce the noise radiated inside the room. Such measures have been applied since a long time by the shipyards, but mostly with empirical methods, based on a trial-and-error procedure. The aim of the present work is to summarise the physical concepts that are at the bases of the noise counter-measures and to review the physical quantities {{that can be used to}} quantify their effectiveness. The case of the application of viscoelastic materials in a constrained layer arrangement to the cabin floor is discussed in particular, with a description of the main material and geometrical parameters and an evaluation of their influence on the performance of the treatment. A description is included of a simplified procedure for a comparative testing of different viscoelastic materials and of some results of this procedure...|$|E
40|$|Noise pollution, {{caused by}} traffic, {{industrial}} activities {{is one of}} the main local environmental problems: actually, about 20 percent of the European population is highly annoyed by environmental noise. The importance of this problem has been fixed by DIR 2002 / 49 /CE, relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise, with the aim of containing and eliminating acoustical impact caused by different sources, to improve or maintain environmental acoustical quality. Italian legislation identifies in the noise mapping, (which consists in the subdivision of a land in areas, acoustically homogeneous, where limit values are fixed) the instrument put in charge for territorial acoustical management: this instrument must be suitable with the existent acoustical conditions to allow favorable development territorial plans and an effective land management. The <b>acoustical</b> <b>planning,</b> in the case of particularly event could have a particular meaning, being not only an answer to territorial management, but also a preliminary acoustical evaluation ex ante. The noise mapping can represent a significant picture of acoustical conditions before the construction of infrastructure, such as roads or railways, to compare with the acoustical predicted impact of the new source. This research is about a study case, which aim is at first the realization of noise mapping for an Italian little town, with a project of a new road infrastructure. The noise mapping which has been done on the whole municipal territory had to confront with two aspects: a new residential urban area and a natural park as protected zone, areas with a good acoustical quality, which will be involved in the construction of a new infrastructure. In fact, the tunnel, which will connect the existing roads and highways, will have the inlet and outlet in these areas. In this research an acoustical analysis of noise mapping has been done, integrated with the new problems, induced by the road variations and by its work constructio...|$|E
500|$|At 8:05 am, as Missouri sailed past Fort Wool, Captain Brown turned {{control of}} the ship (known in naval terms as the [...] "conn" [...] of the ship) over to the officer of the deck and {{departed}} for the chart house. His arrival at the chart house caused Ensign E. R. Harris, who had been tracking the battleship's course on the chart, {{to move away from}} the table, resulting in the interruption of the plot. Around the same time Captain Brown informed Commander Peckham that Missouri would soon run an acoustical range. This was the first time that the executive officer had heard about a <b>planned</b> <b>acoustical</b> range run.|$|R

500|$|Approximately {{two minutes}} after departing for the chart room, Captain Brown reemerged {{on the open}} bridge and reassumed the conn of the battleship. He summoned Lieutenants Hatfield and Arnold, Missouris morning and forenoon {{officers}} of the watch, respectively, and informed them of the planned run through the acoustical range. As with Commander Peckham, {{this was the first}} time that either of these two men had heard anything about the <b>planned</b> <b>acoustical</b> test run. When Captain Brown noted their confused looks, he promptly informed the men to [...] "Go get yourselves informed", at which point both officers reported to the chart room on level eight. There they learned of the impending run through the acoustical range by looking at the chart with the buoys marking the range; despite this, both remained confused over aspects of the planned run.|$|R
