5000|$|The BNC corpus {{has been}} tagged for {{grammatical}} information (part of speech). The tagging system, named CLAWS, went through improvements to yield the latest CLAWS4 system, {{which is used}} for tagging the BNC. CLAWS1 {{was based on a}} hidden Markov model and, when employed in <b>automatic</b> <b>tagging,</b> managed to successfully tag 96% to 97% of each text analyzed. CLAWS1 was upgraded to CLAWS2 by removing the need for manual processing to prepare the texts for <b>automatic</b> <b>tagging.</b> The latest version, CLAWS4, includes improvements such as more powerful word-sense disambiguation (WSD) abilities, and the ability to deal with variation in orthography and markup language. Later work on the tagging system looked at increasing the success rates in <b>automatic</b> <b>tagging</b> and reducing the work needed for manual processing, while maintaining effectiveness and efficiency by introducing software to replace some of the manual work. Subsequently, a new program called the [...] "Template Tagger" [...] was introduced for a corrective function. Tags indicating ambiguity were later added. Manual tagging is still necessary, as CLAWS4 is still unable to deal with foreign words.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose to use a set of block-level audio {{features}} for <b>automatic</b> <b>tag</b> prediction. As the proposed feature set is extremely high-dimensional we will investigate the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as compression method to make the tag classification computationally tractable. We will then compare this block-level feature set to a standard feature set that is used in a state-of-theart tag prediction approach. To compare the two feature sets {{we report on the}} tag classification results obtained for two publicly available tag classification datasets using the same classification approach for both feature sets. We will show that the proposed features set outperform the standard feature set, thus contributing to the state-of-the-art in <b>automatic</b> <b>tag</b> prediction. 1...|$|R
40|$|Music {{listeners}} frequently {{use words}} to describe music. Personalized music recommendation systems such as Last. fm and Pandora rely on manual annotations (tags) as a mechanism for querying and navigating large music collections. A well-known issue in such recommendation systems {{is known as the}} cold-start problem: {{it is not possible to}} recommend new songs/tracks until those songs/tracks have been manually annotated. <b>Automatic</b> <b>tag</b> annotation based on content analysis is a potential solution to this problem and has recently been gaining attention. We describe how stacked generalization can be used to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art <b>automatic</b> <b>tag</b> annotation system for music based on audio content analysis and report results on two publicly available datasets...|$|R

As of version 1.70b2 FLAC encoding is native, but for version 1.51 FLAC and other codecs {{can be used by}} using an external encoder. For convenience, it supports CD-Text to allow ripped tracks, with reduced user effort, to have the names of songs, artists and albums. It can also automatically identify (most) inserted audio CDs and look up the metadata by means of an online database (freedb) for <b>automatic</b> <b>tagging,</b> naming and sorting of ripped files. It also includes cdparanoia for robust CD reading. CDex is considered to be very configurable and relatively easy to use.|$|E
5000|$|POS tagging {{work has}} been done in a variety of languages, and the set of POS tags used varies greatly with language. Tags usually are {{designed}} to include overt morphological distinctions, although this leads to inconsistencies such as case-marking for pronouns but not nouns in English, and much larger cross-language differences. The tag sets for heavily inflected languages such as Greek and Latin can be very large; tagging words in agglutinative languages such as Inuit may be virtually impossible. At the other extreme, Petrov, D. Das, and R. McDonald ("A Universal Part-of-Speech Tagset" [...] http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2086) have proposed a [...] "universal" [...] tag set, with 12 categories (for example, no subtypes of nouns, verbs, punctuation, etc.; no distinction of [...] "to" [...] as an infinitive marker vs. preposition, etc.). Whether a very small set of very broad tags or a much larger set of more precise ones is preferable, depends on the purpose at hand. <b>Automatic</b> <b>tagging</b> is easier on smaller tag-sets.|$|E

We propose a photo tag recommendation system which automatically extracts semantics from visual and meta-data features to complement existing tags.

40|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>tagging</b> can {{automatically}} label {{images with}} semantic tags to significantly facilitate multimedia search and organization. Existing tagging methods often use probabilistic or co-occurring tags, which {{may result in}} ambiguity and noise. In this paper, we propose a novel <b>automatic</b> <b>tagging</b> algorithm which tags a test image with an Informative and Correlative Tag (ICTag) set. The assigned ICTag set can provide a more precise description of the image by exploring both the information capability of individual tags and the tag-to-set correlation. Measures to effectively estimate the information capability of individual tags and the correlation between a tag and the candidate tag set are designed. To reduce the computational complexity, we also introduce a heuristic method to achieve efficient <b>automatic</b> <b>tagging.</b> The experiment results confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. © Springe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Software tagging {{has been}} shown to be an efficient, {{lightweight}} social computing mechanism to improve different social and technical aspects of software development. Despite the importance of tags, there exists limited support for <b>automatic</b> <b>tagging</b> for software artifacts, especially during the evolutionary process of software development. We conducted an empirical study on IBM Jazz’s repository and found that there are several missing tags in artifacts and more precise tags are desirable. This paper introduces a novel, accurate, <b>automatic</b> <b>tagging</b> recommendation tool that is able to take into account users’ feedbacks on tags, and is very efficient in coping with software evolution. The core technique is an <b>automatic</b> <b>tagging</b> algorithm that is based on fuzzy set theory.

To model these tags and these relationships, we describe a conditional restricted Boltz-mann machine. Using this model to fill in tags that should probably be present given a context of other <b>tags,</b> we train <b>automatic</b> <b>tag</b> classifiers (autotaggers) that outperform those trained on the original data. 1...|$|R
40|$|Image annotations, {{often in}} the form of tags, are very useful when {{indexing}} large image collections. They provide an intuitive human centered way to search and browse images using text queries. However, tagging images is very time consuming to do manually so researchers have developed methods for automatic image tagging. These methods rely on a set of example images with tags to learn what images should be associated with which tags. One thing that has been overlooked with these systems is the fact that example images with tags are different in each language. Generally researchers have only made English <b>automatic</b> <b>tagging</b> systems and not considered the problems of building equally good systems in other minor languages where it is more difficult to obtain example images and tags. In this thesis we study how an <b>automatic</b> <b>tagging</b> system in Japanese compares to an <b>automatic</b> <b>tagging</b> system in English. We find that the Japanese system suffers in performance and based on this we improve the performance by leveraging the dominant English language system. We compare an automatic translation of the tags using a dictionary to our proposed translation matrix method. Our method estimates the translation of tags based on the co-occurrence of different language tags in images. We show that our proposed method using very simple heuristics performs about the same as a high end machine translator in the case of <b>automatic</b> <b>tagging</b> systems. There are several improvements to be made but with this work we show that the conceptual idea is strong, giving reasons to improve it further. The main contribution of our approach is the ability to translate words that a dictionary cannot interpret as well as considering the context when establishing a translation...|$|E

40|$|Low-level {{aspects of}} music audio such as timbre, {{loudness}} and pitch, can be relatively well modelled by features extracted from short-time windows. Higher-level aspects such as melody, harmony, phrasing and rhythm, {{on the other}} hand, are salient only at larger timescales and require a better representation of time dynamics. For various music information retrieval tasks, one would benefit from modelling both low and high level aspects in a unified feature extraction framework. By combining adaptive features computed at different timescales, short-timescale events are put in context by detecting longer timescale features. In this paper, we describe a method to obtain such multi-scale features and evaluate its effectiveness for <b>automatic</b> <b>tag</b> annotation. 1...|$|R

Fully manual image tagging which is tagged by user will be most accurate tags when the user tags correct information. Nevertheless, most of users do not make effort on task of tagging.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{preliminary}} pilot study of belief annotation and <b>automatic</b> <b>tagging.</b> Our {{objective is to}} explore semantic meaning beyond surface propositions. We aim to model people’s cognitive states, namely their beliefs as expressed through linguistic means. We model {{the strength of their}} beliefs and their (the human) degree of commitment to their utterance. We explore only the perspective of the author of a text. We classify predicates into one of three possibilities: committed belief, non committed belief, or not applicable. We proceed to manually annotate data to that end, then we build a supervised framework to test the feasibility of automatically predicting these belief states. Even though the data is relatively small, we show that automatic prediction of a belief class is a feasible task. Using syntactic features, we are able to obtain significant improvements over a simple baseline of 23 % F-measure absolute points. The best performing <b>automatic</b> <b>tagging</b> condition is where we use POS tag, word type feature AlphaNumeric, and shallow syntactic chunk information CHUNK.

For an unlabeled image, we first retrieve its visual neighbors from a large user-tagged image database. We then select relevant tags from the result images to annotate the unlabeled image. To tackle the unreliability and sparsity of user tagging, we introduce a joint-modality tag relevance estimation method which efficiently addresses both textual and visual clues.
