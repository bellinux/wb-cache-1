5|$|The castles made a clear, {{imperial}} {{statement about}} Edward's intentions to rule North Wales {{on a permanent}} basis. <b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> they were typically located on sites that had {{been associated with the}} former Welsh princes. Caernarfon, in particular, stands out for its use of banded, coloured stone in the walls, statues of eagles and its polygonal, rather than round, towers. There has been extensive academic debate over the interpretation of these features. Historian Arnold Taylor argued that the design of the castle was a representation of the Walls of Constantinople. The conscious use of imagery from the Byzantine Roman Empire was therefore an assertion of authority by EdwardI. Recent work by historian Abigail Wheatley suggests that the design of Caernarfon was indeed an assertion of Edward's authority, but that it drew on imagery from Roman sites in Britain with the intent of creating an allusion of Arthurian legitimacy for the king.|$|E

25|$|Born, however, {{had learned}} matrix algebra from Rosanes, <b>as</b> <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> but Born had also learned Hilbert's theory of {{integral}} equations and quadratic forms for {{an infinite number}} of variables as was apparent from a citation by Born of Hilbert's work Grundzüge einer allgemeinen Theorie der Linearen Integralgleichungen published in 1912.|$|E

50|$|In this school, boys {{representing}} {{nearly all}} of the national diasporas of St Petersburg were educated — Russians, Germans, French, English, Tatars, Jews, Finns, Chinese, etc. In this way, <b>as</b> was <b>already</b> <b>noted</b> {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, this school could in no way be called monarchical, democratic, republican, or aristocratic. It always strove to be human.|$|R
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>noted</b> {{when the}} {{standard}} values were first formulated , the relative {{strength of the}} pieces changes as a game progresses to the endgame. The value of pawns, rooks and, to a lesser extent, bishops may increase. The knight tends to lose some power, {{and the strength of}} the queen may be slightly lessened, as well. Some examples follow.|$|E
25|$|Kierkegaard {{primarily}} discusses subjectivity {{with regard}} to religious matters. <b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> he argues that doubt {{is an element of}} faith and {{that it is impossible to}} gain any objective certainty about religious doctrines such as the existence of God or the life of Christ. The most one could hope for would be the conclusion that it is probable that the Christian doctrines are true, but if a person were to believe such doctrines only to the degree they seemed likely to be true, he or she would not be genuinely religious at all. Faith consists in a subjective relation of absolute commitment to these doctrines.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{writings}} of the Báb have been lost. The Báb himself stated they exceeded five hundred thousand verses in length; the Qur'an, in contrast, is 6300 verses in length. If one assumes 25 verses per page, that would equal 20,000 pages of text. Nabíl-i-Zarandí, in The Dawn-breakers, mentions nine complete commentaries on the Qur'an, revealed during the Báb's imprisonment at Maku, which have been lost without a trace. Establishing the true text of the works that are still extant, <b>as</b> <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> is not always easy, and some texts will require considerable work. Others, however, are in good shape; several of the Báb's major works are available in the handwriting of his trusted secretaries.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{a formal}} {{planning}} commission {{in support of}} the Commissioners' Plan was not created, there was no authority outside of the Common Council to protect its integrity. Thus the elimination of the Grand Parade and the wholesale marketplace and the addition of Union, Tompkins, Stuyvestant and Madison Squares came about, as well <b>as</b> the <b>already</b> <b>noted</b> additions of Lexington and Madison Avenues. [...] Fourth and Sixth Avenues were extended downtown, and Broadway uptown.|$|R
25|$|Timesitheus {{served as}} Praetorian Prefect for some {{three years from}} 241 {{until his death in}} 243. The only {{narrative}} source on his term of office is the SHA and, <b>as</b> <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> the author of the Vita Tres Gordiani could hardly have been more fulsome in singing his praises, both as the father-in-law of the young emperor and as the protector of the Empire. This generous assessment is supported by two citations of supposed correspondence between Timesitheus and Gordian (probably invented) and a number of topoi familiarly used in Latin historiography to define a worthy servant of the state - i.e. a crackdown on sale of offices by members of the palatini, care for the defence of the frontiers and exemplary behaviour in his capacity as commander of the Praetorian Guard. The favourable view of Timesitheus's term of office entertained by the SHA is not challenged by modern scholars - although the inadequacy of the data is acknowledged.|$|E
500|$|Alfred died in 899, {{and his son}} Edward the Elder {{worked with}} Alfred's son-in-law, Æthelred, and daughter, Æthelflæd, to re-take parts of {{southern}} England from the Norse. [...] During these campaigns he built the two burhs of Hertford <b>as</b> <b>already</b> <b>noted.</b> [...] Their sites have not been found, and probably lie beneath the streets of Hertford itself. [...] From Hertford, together with Stafford, Tamworth and Witham, Edward and Æthelflæd pushed the Danes back to Northumbria {{in a series of}} battles. Anglo-Saxon Hertford is an example of town planning as demonstrated by its organised rectangular grid street pattern.|$|E
500|$|The bold weights of Gill Sans, {{including}} Kayo, {{have been}} particularly criticised for design {{issues such as the}} eccentric design of the [...] "i" [...] and [...] "j", and for their extreme boldness. (Gill Sans' standard weight is, <b>as</b> <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> already quite bold by modern standards.) Gill argued in his Essay on Typography that the nineteenth-century tendency to make sans-serif typefaces attention-grabbingly bold was self-defeating, since the result was compromised legibility. In the closing paragraph he ruefully noted how he had contributed to the genre: There are now about as many different varieties of letters as there are different kinds of fools. I myself am responsible for designing five different sorts of sans-serif letters – each one thicker and fatter than the last because each advertisement has to try and shout down its neighbours.|$|E
40|$|Emotions {{and social}} {{behavior}} are intimately related: the former motivate the latter, {{and much of}} social communication overlaps with emotional expression, <b>as</b> Darwin <b>already</b> <b>noted.</b> The reviews in this issue highlight {{the fact that their}} neural substrates also show considerable overlap. While doing so, they raise a series of important questions than can serve to organize the diverse contributions in this issue, questions that spring from the diversity of species examined and methods. ...|$|R
5000|$|Problems 48-55 {{show how}} to compute an {{assortment}} of areas. Problem 48 is notable in that it succinctly computes the area of a circle by approximating π. Specifically, problem 48 explicitly reinforces the convention (used throughout the geometry section) that [...] "a circle's area stands to that of its circumscribing square in the ratio 64/81." [...] Equivalently, the papyrus approximates π as 256/81, <b>as</b> was <b>already</b> <b>noted</b> above in the explanation of problem 41.|$|R

50|$|The most {{important}} unequal exchange {{in the world}} economy nowadays concerns the exchange between agricultural goods and industrial goods, i.e. the terms of trade favour industrial goods against agricultural goods. Often, <b>as</b> Raul Prebisch <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> this has meant that more and more agricultural output must be produced and sold, to buy a given amount of industrial goods. This issue has become the subject of heated controversy at recent WTO meetings.|$|R
60|$|This premis'd, I am to {{tell the}} Reader that the last Civil War in this Lunar Country ended in the Victors {{confounding}} their own Conquests by their intestine Broils, they being <b>as</b> is <b>already</b> <b>noted</b> a most Eternally Quarrelling Nation; upon this new Breach, they that first began the War, turn'd about, and pleading that they took up Arms to regulate the Government, not to overthrow it, fell in with the Family of their Kings, who had been banish'd, {{and one of them}} destroy'd, and restor'd the Crown to the Family, and the Nation to the Crown, just for all the World as the Presbyterians in England did, in the Case of King Charles the Second.|$|R

2500|$|Fundamental {{human rights}} and {{democratic}} values, including freedom of [...] "thought, faith, and conscience," [...] are enshrined in the constitution, which also guarantees the status of legal person to religious denominations and allows religious teaching in public schools.

40|$|In this paper*, I {{defend the}} idea that the degree of cross-linguistic {{variability}} allowed by the relativized definitions of Governing Categories (henceforth GCs) for pronominals and anaphors propounded by Huang (1983), Chomsky (1986) and Aoun (1986) is not sufficient, <b>as</b> was <b>already</b> <b>noted</b> by Manzini & Wexler (1987) and Koster (1985, 1987). Moreover, the Basque data 1 to be analyzed will also show the superiority of the latter's theory over Manzini & Wexler's. Finally, I will have to introduce slight modifications into Koster's theory, allowing for the presence of PROs to specify the maximal projections of dyadic Ns and Ps (these specifiers being submitted to the licensing condition that the Xmax which contains them be the predicate of a stative predication), so as to account for data which had <b>already</b> been <b>noted</b> in e. g. Rebuschi (1988, 1989), but had been left unexplained...|$|R
40|$|Italian {{literature}} {{is characterized by}} the substantial silence on the issue of migration, showing, <b>as</b> Gramsci <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> the elitist attitude of his man of letters. These have left in more commercial production the task of witnessing the exodus that for over a century has affected the nation. Starting with a look to the critical positions and disciplines on the topic, the aim of the present paper is to analyze the resurgence of this theme in contemporary Italian fiction focusing on two novels: Il piatto dell'angelo, by Laura Pariani, and Mare al mattino, by Margaret Mazzantini. This reappearance of the topic of migration in Italian {{literature is}} matched by a similar phenomenon in the Argentine, an aspect that the essay will refer to emphasize the fundamental differences that determine the narrative strands in both countries...|$|R
30|$|Another notable {{reason for}} the {{decrease}} in the daily average grazing time, mentioned by 89 [*]% of the study participants, is the prohibition of transboundary grazing, <b>as</b> we have <b>already</b> <b>noted.</b> When asked about how grazing was managed {{in the past to}} ensure sustainable rangeland regeneration, 90 [*]% answered that they grazed across borders and boundaries. This practice was a natural (hima-like) protection and graze management system where herders moved from place to place based on a collective understanding of where not to graze each year. Today, however, such a system no longer exists, according to the participants in the study.|$|R
2500|$|The sole regnal date (year 1) attested for Smenkhkare {{comes from}} a wine docket from [...] "the house of Smenkhkare". [...] This date might however refer either to the reign of Smenkhkare or his successor, but it is {{doubtful}} he ruled for more than year. [...] <b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> Dodson views Smenkhkare as Akhenaten's coregent {{for about a year}} beginning about Year 13 and who did not have a sole reign, while Allen depicts Smenkhkare as successor to Neferneferuaten.|$|E
2500|$|Second, the Catholic Church {{is still}} seen as profoundly [...] "other" [...] in modern culture and is {{therefore}} an object of continuing fascination. <b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> it is ancient {{in a culture that}} celebrates the new, professes truths in a postmodern culture that looks skeptically on any claim to truth, and speaks of mystery in a rational, post-Enlightenment world. It is therefore the perfect context for scriptwriters searching for the [...] "conflict" [...] required in any story.|$|E
2500|$|As a Cambridge honours {{graduate}} in mathematics, Turing {{might have been}} expected to propose a test of computer intelligence requiring expert knowledge in some highly technical field, and thus anticipating a more recent approach to the subject. [...] Instead, <b>as</b> <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> the test which he described in his seminal 1950 paper requires the computer to be able to compete successfully in a common party game, and this by performing as well as the typical man in answering a series of questions so as to pretend convincingly to be the woman contestant.|$|E
50|$|At {{the outset}} of the reign of the Emperor Numerian (284) a man named Aper (Arrius Aper?) was <b>already</b> en poste <b>as</b> Praetorian Prefect. The Vita Cari also says that he was the father of Numerian's wife. It is {{probable}} that this Aper was the same man <b>as</b> the one <b>already</b> <b>noted</b> <b>as</b> praepositus of a detached force and as the former equestrian vice praeses of Pannonia. However, he is thought to have been prefect during the war with Persia initiated by Numerian's father, Carus and he had probably been given that office at {{the outset of}} Carus's reign in 282.|$|R
5000|$|The Vagabond was {{the first}} novel that Colette wrote without the actual or claimed {{collaboration}} of her first husband Henry Gauthier-Villars, commonly known <b>as</b> Willy. <b>Already</b> a <b>noted</b> and admired writer {{at the time of}} its publication, Colette with this novel was acknowledged by French readers as one of the most prominent and talented writers of her time. The book is unquestionably autobiographical in many ways-the facts of the heroine’s life, the character of her first husband, and the qualities of the heroine herself.|$|R
60|$|I {{had sent}} my man, <b>as</b> I have <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> into England, {{in order to}} bring over the troops my father had raised for the King of Sweden. He {{executed}} his commission so well, that he landed with five troops at Embden in very good condition; and orders were sent them by the king, to join the Duke of Lunenberg's army, which they did at the siege of Boxtude, in the Lower Saxony. Here by long and very sharp service they were most of them cut off, and though they were several times recruited, yet I understood there were not three full troops left.|$|R
