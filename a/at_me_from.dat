500|$|... "Conflict Resolution" [...] was {{the fifth}} episode of the series written by Greg Daniels, {{who is also the}} {{executive}} producer and show runner for The Office. The episode was the third of the series directed by Charles McDougall; he had previously directed the earlier season two episodes [...] "Christmas Party" [...] and [...] "Dwight's Speech". The episode features Angela and Oscar arguing over Angela's poster of two babies playing saxophones. [...] Jenna Fischer said that [...] "As a cast, the baby poster is one of our favorite props... Angela received the poster from her Secret Santa in the Christmas episode." [...] Fischer {{went on to say that}} [...] "I had to stand in between Angela and Oscar as they bicker about the poster while Michael tries to mediate the situation. The whole time, the cute jazz babies are staring <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> the poster. It was hilarious!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{memory of}} her father {{apparently}} motivated Maria Amélia's dedication to her education. The late Duke of Braganza cast a large shadow in her life, and was always remembered by his daughter, who would often ask the people around her: [...] "and my father, who looks <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> heaven, shall he be pleased with his daughter?" [...] She was never quite {{able to cope with}} her father's death and it deeply touched her. Maria Amélia remarked after she saw a garden where Pedro planted a sycamore: [...] "A profound sadness invaded me when contemplating these trees, which had survived my father and probably shall survive all of us. It is an image of human fragility. Man is the most frail of all beings; he dies, while the objects which were seemingly created for his use, endure the centuries!... But I am digressing in my melancholic reflections".|$|E
500|$|Still in {{a shallow}} dive, I {{observed}} another P-38 and an Me 109 going round and round. It seemed that the 38 needed help so I started down. At about , [...] the Jerry, still way out of my range, turned under me and slightly to the right. I rolled over on my back, following him and gave him an ineffective burst at long range. By this time I was traveling in excess of [...] My left window blew out, scaring {{the hell out of}} me. I thought I had been hit by some of the ground fire I had observed in the vicinity. I regained control of the aircraft and pulled out above a wheat field. I tried to contact the flight to get myself recognized, but observed an Me 109 making a pass <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> about seven o'clock high. I broke left as well as my plane could and the Jerry overshot. I straightened out and gave him a burst. He chandelled steeply to the left and I shot some more. He passed right over me and I slipped over in an Immelmann. As I straightened out at the top, I saw the pilot bail out.|$|E
60|$|All {{the while}} the empty tumbler seemed to look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> reproachfully <b>from</b> the window sill.|$|R
60|$|I bowed. Sir Thomas stood very stiffly, looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{severely}} <b>from</b> {{under the}} broad {{brim of his}} hat.|$|R
60|$|We {{said good-bye}} {{at the club}} front door. He smiled down <b>at</b> <b>me</b> benevolently <b>from</b> {{the top of the}} steps.|$|R
2500|$|Underwood has {{credited}} [...] "music as a whole" [...] as her major influence, {{since she}} [...] "grew {{up listening to}} music" [...] and [...] "there were songs, different kind of songs coming <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> everywhere". But she has occasionally mentioned Rock acts like Queen, George Michael, The Rolling Stones, and My Chemical Romance as influences. Among Country artists, she has listed George Strait, Dolly Parton, Randy Travis, Martina McBride, Reba McEntire, and Garth Brooks as influences. Although never publicly mentioning Faith Hill and Shania Twain as musical influences, critics have linked Underwood's musical style to those of Hill and Twain. Her music is generally Country pop with Rock influence {{similar to that of}} Kelly Clarkson, as noticed by Rolling Stone. She has also released songs with Christian music influence.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked back}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> {{the door with}} a twinkle in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> {{under his}} strong brows drawn down, {{a twinkle in}} his eye.|$|E
60|$|Later, I sought her out. She {{looked up}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> amusedly <b>from</b> the window-seat in our living-room, {{where she had}} been talking to the Scherer girls.|$|R
60|$|Eugène scowled <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>from</b> <b>me</b> to Andrea. To pay him {{for that}} scowl, I had it in my mind to stay; but, {{overcoming}} the clownish thought, I took Andrea by the arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} mean the Riverside Franchise," [...] I said. He looked up <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> miserably, <b>from</b> the chair into which he had sunk, {{his hands in his}} pockets.|$|R
60|$|He drew {{himself up}} and folded his arms, and looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> the immeasurable height of his own superiority.|$|E
60|$|With his {{disengaged}} hand he made {{a menace}} of striking me, and then looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> head to foot.|$|E
60|$|She {{made a face}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> {{behind a}} vase of flowers. Mrs. Bundercombe {{apparently}} thought it well to explain her position.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> anxiously. <b>From</b> {{her point}} of view, {{this was the}} climax, the supreme moment. She hesitated. I seemed to see her {{marshalling}} her forces, the telling sentences, the persuasive adjectives; rallying them together for the grand assault.|$|R
60|$|These {{last words}} he spoke down <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> smiling <b>from</b> high above; the next, {{he was under}} my feet. I {{continued}} to follow his evolutions with a childish fixity: they made me giddy and vacant, and I spoke as in a dream.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But who is this?' asked General Savary, {{pointing}} <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> 'I understood <b>from</b> {{your information}} {{that there were}} only two besides yourself, Monsieur--.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Crimble?" [...] he repeated. His eyes, greenish at that moment, shot {{an angry}} glance <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> under their lids. [...] "Who is he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At this {{friendly}} {{question his}} aspect changed. He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> under his eyebrows with the heavy, dull glance of a guasso--of a peasant.|$|E
60|$|The {{boy looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> head to foot, and an {{expression}} such {{as might be}} produced by too much lemon juice came upon his face.|$|E
6000|$|But {{twenty-four hours}} soon glide away; and [...] "Starboleens ahoy; eight bells there below;" [...] <b>at</b> last started <b>me</b> <b>from</b> a troubled doze.|$|R
60|$|Surprise overspread Gonzaga's face. He {{seemed about}} to speak, and checked, {{and his eyes were}} very searchingly bent upon Galeotto's face, which {{remained}} inscrutable as stone. Then the Governor looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>from</b> <b>me</b> back again <b>at</b> Galeotto. At last he smiled, whilst I bowed before him, but very vaguely conscious of what might impend.|$|R
6000|$|... "You--you Puritan!" [...] she cried. [...] "To {{think that}} I should have married a Puritan! What would my great-great-great-great-grandfather say, who {{was such a}} stanch Royalist? Why, I think I can see him {{frowning}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> now, <b>from</b> the door, in his blue velvet goat and silverlaced waistcoat." ...|$|R
60|$|She cast {{a glance}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> eyes that {{appeared}} to be very small, unless for that instant it was mine that I saw reflected there.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Colonel Mac-Ivor,' said Waverley, {{without any}} farther salutation, 'I have {{to inform you}} that one of your people has this instant fired <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> a lurking-place.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear old Roddy! I {{saw your}} white face staring <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> the corner. You are not changed, {{for all your}} grand clothes and your London friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|KING. [...] "'You look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{too much}} <b>from</b> the {{favorable}} side! Ask these Gentlemen about my humors and my caprices; {{they will tell}} you fine things of me.' ...|$|R
50|$|In two {{episodes of}} Barney & Friends, A Splash Party Please from 1992 and Look <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> I'm 3! <b>from</b> 1993, the {{children}} perform the song with Barney and Baby Bop.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, fired-oh-Ed. Canned. Got the gate. Thrown out. Got the razzle-dazzle. Got {{the hook}} thrown into me. Bounced. Kiyudeled. That is, at least, I will be, {{as soon as}} I let the old man get <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> judging <b>from</b> the love-letters he's been sending me, {{inviting}} me to cut a switch and {{come out to the}} wood-shed with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are leaving}} {{us for a}} few days?" [...] I remarked, {{suddenly}} catching {{a glimpse of a}} face like a round moon beaming <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> the window.|$|E
6000|$|The doctor, {{who was a}} stout, sharp man, looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> head to foot, {{and then}} he said, [...] "I'm sorry to say I have n't seen him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see nothing}} now," [...] said I, closing my own eyes, [...] "unless {{it be the}} face of a sprite {{laughing}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> the bottom of a deep well." ...|$|E

60|$|HAROLD. And if {{she never}} mention'd me, perhaps The painful {{circumstances}} which I heard-- I will not vex you by repeating them-- Only last week <b>at</b> Littlechester, drove <b>me</b> <b>From</b> out her memory. She has disappear'd, They told <b>me,</b> <b>from</b> the farm--and darker news.|$|R
60|$|The King looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> angrily, and <b>from</b> {{the court}} behind rose a murmur of wonder mingled with wrath, wonder at my marksmanship, and wrath because I had dared to shoot before the King.|$|R
