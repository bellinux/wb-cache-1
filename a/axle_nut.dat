5000|$|Some {{specialized}} sockets {{are made}} with a specialized [...] "6 flute" [...] etc. socket that attaches to damaged bolts of both metric and fractional inch sizes for removal. Some specialized sockets are made to fit specific specialized applications and are designed and sized for that specific application. Spark plug sockets, oxygen sensor sockets, ball joint sockets, <b>axle</b> <b>nut</b> sockets, etc. fit in this category.|$|E
50|$|The hub axle of a {{hub gear}} (unlike {{that of a}} {{derailleur}} system) will carry torque in all gears except direct drive, and so must be securely braced against rotation. While anti-rotation washers between the dropout and <b>axle</b> <b>nut</b> have often proved adequate, wider-ranging modern systems use a reaction arm affixed to the chain stay. Rear wheels with drum brakes (a feature on some commuter bicycles) require a reaction arm anyway.|$|E
5000|$|In general an {{axle width}} should be chosen that {{is close to}} the width of the deck it will be used with. For example, a 7.75" [...] wide deck will usually be fitted with trucks that have axles between 7.5" [...] wide and 8.0" [...] wide. (Standard truck <b>axle</b> <b>nut</b> size is 5/16"-24tpi UNF, and the thinner [...] "jam" [...] style with an {{optional}} nylon lock.) Trucks that are too wide can make doing tricks difficult and can cause the wheels {{to get in the way}} when the skateboard is being ridden. Trucks that are too small can be hard to maintain stability and can cause wheel bite to occur when turning.|$|E
50|$|A cone wrench or cone spanner {{is a tool}} used in bicycle {{assembly}} and maintenance to tighten and adjust the cones on a bicycle wheel. Cone wrenches are thinner and lighter than most other open ended wrenches {{that are used to}} work on bicycles. They should be used only for making adjustments to wheel's cones or for other applications such as centering brakes. Using a cone wrench in high torque applications such as loosening outer <b>axle</b> <b>nuts</b> may easily damage the wrench. Cone wrenches are typically about 2 mm thick, compared to approximately 7 mm for a standard open-ended wrench.|$|R
5000|$|Axle bolt and nut: The {{axle bolt}} locates the wheel into the caster yoke. The <b>nut</b> secures the <b>axle</b> to the yoke. In some {{applications}} the <b>axle</b> bolt and <b>nut</b> may be hardened or zinc plated for corrosion resistance. Stainless steel may occasionally be used.|$|R
5000|$|From 1977 to 1982, Chicano Roy was {{the first}} Hispanic {{motorcycle}} chopper builder to conquer the custom motorcycle magazine world, with his right-hand man, and youngest brother of 10, David Garcia. These magazines included Easyrider, Big Bike, Street Chopper, Custom Bike, Chopper, Iron Horse and others. Chicano Roy {{was the first}} to invent items, including, but not limited to, the [...] "Molded Frame", which is a motorcycle frame that has the gas tank and frame molded together to look as one, to give body to the entire skeleton frame; however, the gas tank actually un-bolted just in case the gas tank was damaged in an accident. Chicano Roy molded all types of motorcycle frame from stock to after-market to complete personal fabricated frames. Chicano Roy and Lil brother David also included in their arsenal of customizing the [...] "Frenched Spoon Seat", where the seat actually sat inside the frame, so you did not see a separation in between the frame and the seat. Laminations between the seat and the gas tank or recessed in the gas tank. Plus [...] "The Frenched Axle", where the large ugly back-wheel <b>axle</b> <b>nuts</b> did not protrude outward anymore; rather, they recessed flush with the new body of the frame; extreme front and back leg peaking.|$|R
50|$|The Liger JS P217 was {{conceived}} in 2016 {{in preparation for}} the FIA and ACO's new regulation changes in 2017. Onroak Automotive built a brand new chassis from scratch and focused on improving the mechanics of the car from the Ligier JS P2. Onroak and technical partners focused on the air cooling of the engine radiators and brakes and cockpit air conditioning. The mechanical features of the car that were concentrated on was the implementation of a new <b>axle,</b> <b>nut,</b> and rim to lessen the time of tire changes, the efficiency of the axles, weight distribution, accessibility of mechanics {{at the front of the}} cockpit, aerodynamic efficiency, LMP1 style power steering, and a limited number of chassis pieces. The driver's comfort, space, controls accessibility, and visibility also was paid attention to as well.|$|E
50|$|Longboard {{bearings}} are {{all about}} reducing unnecessary friction to allow flawless stunt. Bearings connect the wheel to turn smoothly. Bearings can be made of many materials, including steel (which is most prevalent), titanium, or ceramics. Ceramic bearings are the most expensive. Bearings are usually rated in the ABEC scale. The ratings run from 1-9, using only odd numbers. The higher the rating, the more precise tolerances the bearing has been machined to. However, ABEC rating is not compulsory and not all bearings use ABEC ratings. Some companies will use other methods to describe the bearings' resistance and durability. Optionally, longboarders add bearing spacers between the bearings in the wheels. This allows for the <b>axle</b> <b>nut</b> to be tightened {{all the way down}} eliminating the high frequency wobbles and increasing the lifetime of the bearings.|$|E
5000|$|A Rzeppa joint (invented by Alfred H. Rzeppa in 1926) {{consists}} of a spherical inner shell with 6 grooves in it and a similar enveloping outer shell. Each groove guides one ball. The input shaft fits in the centre of a large, steel, star-shaped [...] "gear" [...] that nests inside a circular cage. The cage is spherical but with ends open, and it typically has six openings around the perimeter. This cage and gear fit into a grooved cup that has a splined and threaded shaft attached to it. Six large steel balls sit inside the cup grooves and fit into the cage openings, nestled in the grooves of the star gear. The output shaft on the cup then runs through the wheel bearing and is secured by the <b>axle</b> <b>nut.</b> This joint can accommodate the large changes of angle when the front wheels are turned by the steering system; typical Rzeppa joints allow 45°-48° of articulation, while some can give 54°. At the [...] "outboard" [...] end of the driveshaft a slightly different unit is used. The end of the driveshaft is splined and fits into the outer [...] "joint". It is typically {{held in place by}} a circlip.|$|E
50|$|A {{quick release}} skewer is a {{mechanism}} for attaching a wheel to a bicycle. It consists of a rod threaded on one end and with a lever operated cam assembly on the other. The rod is inserted into the hollow axle of the wheel, a special nut is threaded on, and the lever is closed to tighten the cam and secure the wheel to the fork. Wheels equipped with quick release mechanisms can {{be removed from the}} bicycle frame and replaced without using tools by opening and closing the cam lever, thus more quickly than wheels with solid <b>axles</b> and <b>nuts.</b> On the negative side, a quick-release hub renders a wheel more vulnerable to theft and care must be taken to ensure that the mechanism is properly tightened.|$|R
50|$|The typical wagon with 40 to 50 in {{diameter}} wheels could easily move {{over rough ground}} and rocks without high centering and even over most tree stumps if required. The wooden wheels were protected with an iron rim (tire) typically about 1.5 in wide. These iron tires were installed hot so they would shrink tightly onto the wood wheel when they cooled. Nevertheless, it was often necessary to use wooden wedges to keep the iron rim on or soak the wheel in water. The dry desert air sometimes dried the tires so much the iron tire was prone to fall off. Wagon wheels could often be repaired by blacksmiths found along the way or replaced with an abandoned wagon's wheel but otherwise if damaged the wagon usually had to be abandoned. Some damaged wagons were salvaged by cutting the wagon in half and converting the front or rear half of the wagon into a two-wheeled cart. Most of the wagons had a large toolbox, mounted on the left side, usually containing an ax, wagon jack, ropes, short handled shovel, wheel chains for securing the wheels for steep descents and extra chain to hook up another team if double teaming was required for steep ascents and other tools often needed or used. The wagon jack was used for raising each wagon wheel. Then the large <b>axle</b> <b>nut</b> could be unscrewed and the wheel removed for greasing which was required periodically. The wheels were greased {{with a mixture of}} tar or pine resin and lard contained in a covered wooden bucket or large ox horn often hanging from the rear axle to keep its greasy contents away from other goods. Starting with at least one gallon of wagon grease was recommended. On a wagon there was essentially no reverse or brakes and the turning radius was nearly always greater than 125 ft so the teamsters had to think about how to extract the wagon and his team from wherever they went.|$|E
40|$|Sleeve protects {{chromium-plated}} surface near {{outer end}} of axle from scratches during wheel changes. Installed on outer end of axle after <b>axle</b> <b>nut</b> removed but before wheel replaced. Attached {{by use of}} same thread engaging <b>axle</b> <b>nut</b> during operation. Designed to fit axle on nose landing gear on Space Shuttle, underlying sleeve concept applicable to commercial and military aircraft and ground vehicles as well...|$|E
