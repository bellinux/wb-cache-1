5|$|Electronic Arts' 1983 game Worms? is an {{interactive}} implementation of Paterson's worms, where {{each time a}} worm has to turn {{in a way that}} it lacks a rule for, it stops <b>and</b> <b>lets</b> <b>the</b> user choose a direction, which sets that rule for that worm.|$|E
5|$|Unless {{the player}} imports a Mass Effect 2 saved game where Tali cannot appear in Mass Effect 3, Tali shows when the Commander moves to recruit the quarian fleet {{in the fight}} against the Reapers, {{powerful}} sapient cyborgs with intentions to destroy all life. Tali joins the squad, and her conversation options tell of the quarians' new attack on the now Reaper-allied geth, in a bid by the quarians to try and reclaim their homeworld. Depending on the player's choices in the second game, Tali may either be an Admiral or merely an advisor on how to defeat the geth. Eventually, the player must choose between saving the geth or the quarians, or, if certain conditions are fulfilled, negotiating a stand-down and saving both parties. If the player sides with the geth <b>and</b> <b>lets</b> <b>the</b> quarians die, Tali kills herself; otherwise, she fully joins the squad and can be found interacting with other Normandy crew members. Admiral Shala'Raan vas Tonbay fulfills Tali's role in saved games where Tali cannot appear in-game. Shala'Raan does not join Shepard's squad.|$|E
5|$|Goat Simulator is an {{open-ended}} third-person perspective {{game in which}} the player controls a goat. The player is free to explore the game's world, a suburban setting, as a goat, and jump, run, bash things, and lick objects. Licking objects attaches the goat's tongue to the object <b>and</b> <b>lets</b> <b>the</b> player drag the object around until they let go. At any time, the player can let the goat drop into a ragdoll model, allowing the game's physics to take over, and another control makes the game run in slow-motion. A number of environmental features allow the player to manipulate the goat into stunts such as bouncing off trampolines or launching the goat into the air through large fans. The game features a scoring system similar to skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, whereby doing tricks or other actions earns points, while chaining such tricks together in sequence helps build a multiplier that applies to the total score of the tricks done in the sequence. Various in-game goals, such as achieving a certain height, completing flips, or destroying certain objects, are given to the player, but the player {{is not required to}} follow these instructions.|$|E

When Ivan tries to get the truth, she convinces everyone else that he lying. Paul refuses to speak to Ivan and makes his father throw Nicola out of her home. She then tells Laurel that she lied about the whole thing. Laurel then tells everyone inside the pub that Nicola has lied and Ivan refuses to accept everyone's apologies. Rodney thinks that Ivan and Paul should get back together <b>and</b> <b>lets</b> <b>the</b> whole pub know. Ivan is annoyed but then realises he is right.

However, the job soon ends and along with Simon they leave Emmerdale for a new life in Costa Rica.|$|E
25|$|A {{more formal}} {{relationship}} with the community occurs when a person becomes a candidate, and must discern whether the consecrated life is for him. At this stage candidates live with the community. This period enables the person involved to observe and participate in religious life from inside the community, <b>and</b> <b>lets</b> <b>the</b> community decide whether the candidate is suitable. This stage lasts two years.|$|E

25|$|A camping, cowboy, or chuckwagon Dutch oven {{has three}} legs, a wire bail handle, and a {{slightly}} concave, rimmed lid so that coals from the cooking fire can be placed on top as well as below. This provides more uniform internal heat <b>and</b> <b>lets</b> <b>the</b> inside act as an oven. These ovens are typically made of bare cast iron, although some are aluminum. Dutch ovens are often used in Scouting outdoor activities.|$|E
25|$|Also, the {{decision}} {{as to whether or not}} the mate is good can be made with the emotional boundary of the shadchan who, if so desired by the couple, can call and talk to either side in the beginning stages of the dating to iron out issues that can crop up during the dating process. Usually as the couple see more of each other the shadchan backs away <b>and</b> <b>lets</b> <b>the</b> couple manage it themselves. It's expected that the couple keep the shadchan up-to-date on how the shidduch is going at regular intervals.|$|E
25|$|Like {{most other}} things in Wolfe's life, his beer {{drinking}} is bound by ritual. Seated at his desk, Wolfe presses the button twice to ring for beer, and Fritz delivers the bottles unopened; Wolfe uncaps the bottles himself, using an 18-carat gold bottle opener {{given to him by}} a satisfied client. He never drinks directly from the bottle, but instead pours the beer into a glass <b>and</b> <b>lets</b> <b>the</b> foam settle to an appropriate level before drinking. He keeps the gold opener in the center drawer of his desk, where he also keeps the bottlecaps as a means of tracking his daily/weekly consumption.|$|E

25|$|It is {{that single}} word “usual” that brings you up short <b>and</b> <b>lets</b> <b>the</b> poem fan out. It points {{not just to}} the {{regularity}} of Robinson’s own days and years but to the engulfing possibility of a thousand Robinsons out there, in the subway and on the streets, all ticking their lives away like his soundless watch. The poem, entitled “Aspects of Robinson,” is the portrait of the postwar man of affairs: neither laborer nor magnate, but holding steady—and, at first blush, looking purposeful—within the middle rank. He is everything that Weldon Kees dreaded, as well as everything that he suspected he ought to be.|$|E
25|$|Gems {{are rewarded}} after {{completion}} of each arena trial. They {{can be used to}} enhance the weapons by unlocking more ability slots and new abilities at regular intervals. Each trial contains three gems as a reward. The first requires completion, the second is a specific challenge and the third is a time trial. If the arena boss is too difficult, it is possible to complete all these challenges to earn extra gems. Forced has a Mark Combat System, where weapons cause marks on the enemies. Greater number of marks cause certain abilities to have better effects, thus making it more effective to hit a group of enemies a few times before using an ability, rather than using it at the start. Though the difficulty increases in proportion to the number of players and sharing Balfus needs communication between them, multiplayer is easier <b>and</b> <b>lets</b> <b>the</b> player focus on specific abilities and tactical roles instead of being forced to cover every possibility in single player; also, if a player dies, the trial can be completed as long as another survives till the end.|$|E
25|$|Arriving at Norway during winter, Gudrid is {{amazed that}} {{the trees are}} huge {{compared}} to {{the ones on the}} islands. When the group goes ashore to make camp, they are suddenly attacked by a bear that is awake despite winter. The bear almost kills Thorfinn and Einar, but is suddenly killed by a crossbow quarrel. A female hunter emerges from the wood and intrudes herself as Hild, daughter of Hrafnkell. Hild skins the bear <b>and</b> <b>lets</b> <b>the</b> group have the meat. While enjoying a bear meat stew, Hild and the group get along quite well, chatting friendly with each other. However, Hild suddenly reveals that she recognizes Thorfinn as the one who killed her father when her home was attacked by Askeladd's warband 8 years before. Thorfinn remembers the attack and admits that he is guilty. Hild almost shoots Thornfinn with her crossbow but hesitates because Karli is strapped to his back. Hild tell the group that she poisoned the soup and will throw the antidote away unless Thorfinn follow her into the woods alone to face her. Thorfinn agrees, swearing to his comrades that he will not die, nor will he hurt Hild. Thorfinn initially keeps himself at bay while evading Hild's quarrels, but he finally figures out her position and charges her. However, he is taken completely by surprise by Hild's specially crafted crossbow's ability to reload rapidly, taking multiple quarrels to his legs. Thorfinn's comrades arrive despite Hild's threat and try to convince Hild that Thorfinn is not the person he once was, and Thonfinn himself begs for time to atone for his sins. Hild remains unconvinced and is about to finish Thorfinn off, but she sees a vision of her father and her old hunting master which causes her to miss. Although she cannot forgive Thorfinn, she agrees to give him time to try and complete his mission. Hild decides to travel with the group {{to keep an eye on}} Thorfinn and swears that if he shows any signs of abandoning his mission to create a land of peace, she will kill him at last.|$|E

500|$|Fez has no enemies, bosses, or punishments for failure—the player-character quickly respawns upon {{falling to}} his death. The game's {{designer}} described Fez as {{a stop and}} smell the flowers' kind of game". It prioritizes puzzle-solving and patience over the platforming genre's traditional interest in dexterity. Fez features a pixelated art style and a limited color palette reminiscent of the 8-bit era. Its homage includes Tetris tetrominos inscribed {{on the walls and}} in the sky, The Legend of Zelda treasure chest animations, Super Mario Bros. mushroom levels, travel by pipe, and floating platforms. The game's settings include forests, factories, a coastal lighthouse, an urban city, and a library. Fez New Game Plus mode adds a first-person perspective feature <b>and</b> <b>lets</b> <b>the</b> player revisit areas to collect [...] "anti-cubes" [...] from harder puzzles.
