25|$|The {{enclosed}} playing area also {{enhances the}} effects of Gainesville's warm and humid fall climate. Game-day temperatures <b>at</b> <b>field</b> <b>level</b> {{have been known to}} exceed 100°F (37°C), creating a swamp-like atmosphere. (This was the impetus for a University of Florida researcher, Robert Cade, to develop Gatorade as a way to combat dehydration.) Furthermore, during hot and sunny day games, Florida's sideline (on the stadium's west side) is in the shade provided by the press box, while the visiting team's sideline (on the stadium's east side) is exposed to the sun.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{was unusually}} {{low to the}} playing field, the air-inflated dome {{occasionally}} figured into game action. Major League Baseball had specific ground rules for the Metrodome. Any ball which struck the Dome roof, or objects hanging from it, remained in play; if it landed in foul territory it became a foul ball, if it landed in fair territory it became a fair ball. Any ball which became caught in the roof over fair ground was a ground rule double. That has only happened three times in its history – Dave Kingman for the Oakland Athletics on May 4, 1984, University of Minnesota Gophers player George Behr and Corey Koskie in 2004. The speakers, being closer to the playing surface, were hit more frequently, especially the speakers in foul ground near the infield, which were typically hit several times a season, which posed an extra challenge to infielders trying to catch them. However, beginning with the 2005 season, the ground rules for Twins games were changed such that any batted ball that struck a speaker in foul territory would automatically be called a foul ball, {{regardless of whether or}} not it was caught. The dome's roof color made it close to impossible to catch balls without taking the eye off the ball. As a result, fielders frequently lost balls in the roof. An example of this is seen in a home run derby put on by a softball entertainment crew prior to a Twins game. Taken <b>at</b> <b>field</b> <b>level,</b> the balls generally tended to be lost in the roof. The roof was high enough that it has never been a concern for events other than baseball.|$|E

40|$|In the Mekong delta region, rodents {{are one of}} {{the major}} pests that rice farmers need to control {{regularly}} using physical and chemical methods. Chemical methods are more commonly used because they are convenient. The Community Trap Barriers System (CTBS) is a new environmentally-friendly, physical rodent control method. Despite being introduced to farmers, the adoption has been slow because the technology requires collective adoption to overcome cost constraints. In this study, collective use of this method was found to be challenging because of two main reasons. First, farmers found it difficult to manage the trap barrier system as a common pool resource. Second, collective use <b>at</b> the <b>field</b> <b>level</b> is constrained by the difficulties to obtain consensus among farmers in the adoption area. Current levels of social capital, the source of collective action, <b>at</b> the <b>field</b> <b>level</b> were found to be in decline when compared with those in the past. The decline is attributed to the changes in relationships between farmers <b>at</b> the <b>field</b> <b>level.</b> Farmers are unable to maintain their traditional networks which were grounded on kin, neighbour, and friendship relations. In addition, social and economic development has improved rural lifestyles but this has resulted in a lack of need for the social capital represented by those traditional relationships, especially for the rice farming practice. The adoption of the CTBS, as well as other collective based technologies will be challenging unless there are efforts to improve social capital <b>at</b> the <b>field</b> <b>level.</b> This may well be best achieved at the local government level because farmers have a strong reliance on the government to facilitate the social capital generation process...|$|R

40|$|The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer- 02 (AMs- 02) {{experiment}} uses a superfluid helium dewar to cool a large superconducting magnet. The outer vapor-cooled shields of the dewar {{are to be}} held at 80 K by four Sunpower M 87 N cryocoolers. These cryocoolers have magnetic {{components that}} might interact with the external applied field generated by the superconducting magnet, thereby degrading the cryocoolers' performance. Engineering models of the Sunpower M 87 have been qualified for operation in a magnetic environment similar to the AMs- 02 magnetic environment. Although there was no noticeable performance degradation <b>at</b> <b>field</b> <b>levels</b> that were comparable to AMs- 02 <b>field</b> <b>levels,</b> {{there appears to be a}} small performance degradation <b>at</b> higher <b>field</b> <b>levels.</b> It was theorized that there were three possible issues related to these performance losses at high magnetic fields: i) induced piston rubbing on the cylinder wall due to forces and torques on the linear motor due to the applied magnetic fields; ii) Magnetic hysteretic and/or eddy current damping of the balancer due to its motion in the applied magnetic fields; iii) Inductance losses in motor due to the applied magnetic field.
