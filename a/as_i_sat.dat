25|$|It was at Rome, on the 15th of October, 1764, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> musing {{amidst the}} ruins of the Capitol, while the bare-footed friars were singing vespers in the temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first started to my mind.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{said that the}} song was [...] "Perfectly acceptable, though {{not in the same}} class as 'Who's That Girl'." [...] Christian Wright from Spin called the song celebratory. Camille Paglia, {{one of the authors of}} The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, said that Madonna's command of massive, resonant basslines impressed her. She wrote: [...] "I recall my stunned admiration <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> in the theater in 1987 and first experienced the crashing, descending chords of Madonna's 'Causing a Commotion', which opened her dreadful movie Who's That Girl. If you want to hear the essence of modernity, listen to those chords, infernal, apocalyptic, and grossly sensual. This is the authentic voice of fin de siècle." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented that [...] "Causing a Commotion" [...] and [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] were not among Madonna's best singles.|$|E
500|$|Nino, a key villain, {{is portrayed}} by Ron Perlman, {{one of the}} last actors to join the cast. Regarding the casting of Perlman, Refn said, [...] "The {{character}} of Nino was originally not particularly interesting, so I asked Ron why he wanted to be in my movie when he's done so many great films. When Perlman said, 'I always wanted to play a Jewish man who wants to be an Italian gangster', and I asked why, and he said, 'because that's what I am – a Jewish boy from New York', well, that automatically cemented it for me." [...] Oscar Isaac portrays a Latino convict named Standard, who is married to Irene and is just released from prison a week after Irene meets The Driver. He found the role to be a bit unappealing and chose to turn the archetypal character into something more. He said of the role: As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down with Nicolas, he explained this universe and world of the story, so we made the character into someone interested in owning a restaurant, someone who made some wrong decisions in his life, ending up in a bad place. By making 'Standard' more specific and more interesting, we found that it made the story that more compelling.|$|E

6000|$|... "Rima, Rima!" [...] {{sounded the}} mocking voice <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>sat</b> down. [...] "Where are you, Rima? I shall catch you, Rima! Have you caught Rima?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Heatherstone {{left the}} room-rather unwillingly, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> thought--and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{down by the}} bedside to listen to {{anything}} which my patient might have to communicate.|$|R
2500|$|Describing {{the origins}} of Hawkman, Fox recalled, [...] "I was faced {{with the problem of}} filling a new book that {{publisher}} Max Gaines was starting... <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> by the window I noticed a bird collecting twigs for a nest. The bird would swoop down, pick up the twig, and fly away. I thought, 'Wouldn't it be great if the bird was a lawman and the twig a crook!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Complaining {{about the}} {{division}} of command between himself and General Taylor, {{in a letter to}} Secretary of War William L. Marcy, Scott wrote of not wishing to [...] "have a fire in his rear (from Washington) while he met a fire in front of the Mexicans". This offended Marcy and also Polk. In another letter, Scott wrote that a letter from Marcy arrived as [...] "at about 6pm <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down to take a hasty plate of soup". The Polk administration, eager to embarrass Scott, promptly published the letter, and the cryptic phrase [...] "hasty plate of soup" [...] appeared in political cartoons and comic songs {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
2500|$|In an eighth-grade {{commencement}} address entitled “Humanity's Next Great Adventure,” {{given at}} a school in San Mateo, California, in 2002, Clancey recalled his own school years, when he “always got extra credit in eighth grade science, answering quiz questions about the latest Gemini two-person launches, getting us ready for the {{first trip to the}} moon in three years. I used to read these stories in the New York Times--absorbing every word. And of course when Star Trek began on TV in September, I watched the first episode and haven't missed any in 36 years. So space travel was on my mind <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> at MY eighth grade graduation, and it's probably no coincidence that I work for NASA today.” ...|$|E
60|$|He did {{not look}} at me while I spoke, but kept his glance fixed upon my bust of Cicero, which <b>as</b> <b>I</b> then <b>sat,</b> was {{directly}} behind me, some six inches above my head.|$|R
60|$|Squeezing {{his hand}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> passed, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down between the Signora and Mrs. Peedles. Both ladies were weeping; the Signora silently, one tear {{at a time}} {{clinging}} fondly to her pretty face as though loath to fall from it; Mrs. Peedles copiously, with explosive gurgles, as of water from a bottle.|$|R
6000|$|... "More of thy tale, old nurse!--more of thy tale!" [...] quoth Eric. [...] "No better didst thou {{ever tell}} me when, <b>as</b> a lad, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> by thee, in the ingle o' winter nights--and {{the company is}} fitting to the tale!" [...] and he pointed to dead Saevuna.|$|R
60|$|I leaned my head upon my hand; {{and felt}} more sorry and downcast, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{looking at the}} fire, than I could have {{supposed}} possible so soon after the fulfilment of my brightest hopes. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> thinking, I happened to meet my aunt's eyes, which were resting on my face. There was an anxious expression in them, but it cleared directly.|$|E
60|$|I {{stood on}} one foot, as it were, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> in my rickety chair.|$|E
60|$|One afternoon, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{alone with}} her, {{she made the}} remark that my reading lessons had ceased.|$|E
6000|$|There was a sergeant, reading, {{in one of}} the fireside groups. As {{he was a man of}} very {{intelligent}} countenance, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have a great respect for non-commissioned officers <b>as</b> a class, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down on the nearest bed, to have some talk with him. (It was the bed of one of the grisliest of the poor skeletons, and he died soon afterwards.) ...|$|R
60|$|Now, my father, {{for awhile}} we were silent and {{alone in the}} hut, and <b>as</b> we <b>sat</b> <b>I</b> thought I heard a rat stir in the thatch.|$|R
60|$|The camps on {{the hills}} at night swarmed with men in hot debate. The {{majority}} believed the camps to be a failure, and loud discussions resounded from the trees <b>as</b> partner and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> at supper. The town-site men were very nervous. The camps were decreasing in population, and the tone was one of general foreboding.|$|R
60|$|And <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{and thought}} {{these things in}} {{bitterness}} of heart, there came a knocking at the door.|$|E
60|$|His low chuckle, {{so full of}} mirth and so {{free from}} malice, was infectious. I laughed also, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down in the hop-vine arbour.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, dearie, ye {{need not}} fash yourself. I've mended them <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> by you, and packed them all. Lie still. They are all right.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{is still}} asleep,' he whispered. 'You were right. She did not call--unless {{she did so}} in her slumber. She has called to me in her sleep before now, sir; <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>sat</b> by, watching, <b>I</b> have seen her lips move, and have known, though no sound came from them, that she spoke of me. I feared the light might dazzle her eyes and wake her, so I brought it here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Anne, yellow-haired {{daughter}} of Donald, surely thou knowest [...] {{not how it}} is with me-- [...] That it is old love, unrepaid, which has worn down from me my [...] strength; [...] That when far from thee, beyond many mountains, the wound in [...] my heart was throbbing, [...] Stirring, and searching for ever, <b>as</b> when <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> beside thee on [...] the turf. [...] NOW, THEN, HEAR ME THIS ONCE, IF FOR EVER I AM TO BE WITHOUT [...] THEE, [...] MY SPIRIT IS BROKEN--GIVE ME ONE KISS ERE I LEAVE THIS LAND! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They must be well mounted," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>as</b> we <b>sat</b> on {{the banks}} of the stream appeasing our hunger with masses of dried buffalo meat, while the horses munched the grass near us.|$|R
60|$|Conscience muttered {{harsh words}} {{in my ear}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> there holding that cold, limp hand with mine, while these inward schemings {{shuttled}} softly to and fro.|$|E
6000|$|That evening, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> in {{the saloon}} after dinner, I {{could hear him}} muttering {{continuously}} in his room. Ransome, who was clearing the table, said to me: ...|$|E
60|$|I felt {{awkward and}} at a loss <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> there before her, as a man unused to drawing-rooms might feel in the {{presence}} of a strange hostess.|$|E
5000|$|Most of the {{recordings}} on this CD were done <b>as</b> if live. ...<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{in front of}} microphones with my bouzouki or mandolin in my lap, my harmonica in its holder round my neck, and my drone volume pedal on the floor, under my foot, and played and sang all in one go. —Sleeve notes from Andy Irvine - Rain on the Roof.|$|R
60|$|Being firmly {{persuaded that}} the Sergeant was wasting his breath to no purpose on Mrs. Yolland, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> enjoying the talk between them, much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>sat,</b> in my time, enjoying a stage play. The great Cuff showed a {{wonderful}} patience; trying his luck drearily {{this way and}} that way, and firing shot after shot, as it were, at random, on the chance of hitting the mark. Everything to Rosanna's credit, nothing to Rosanna's prejudice--that was how it ended, try as he might; with Mrs. Yolland talking nineteen to the dozen, and placing the most entire confidence in him. His last effort was made, when we had looked at our watches, and had got on our legs previous to taking leave.|$|R
5000|$|... "Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud {{voices of}} young men as they saw me / {{approaching}} or passing, / Felt their arms on my neck <b>as</b> <b>I</b> stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me <b>as</b> / <b>I</b> <b>sat,</b> / Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a / word, / Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping, / Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress, / The same old role, the role {{that is what we}} make it, as great as we like, / Or as small as we like, or both great and small." ...|$|R
60|$|That night <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{outside the}} hut smoking--for {{the weather was}} hot, and Stella was lying down inside--old Indaba-zimbi came up, saluted, and squatted at my feet.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> thus, pondering by the {{vineyard}} ditch, the Maid stood by me suddenly. Her helmet was off, her face deadly white, her eyes like two stars.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{take it all}} {{harder than}} I do," [...] I {{returned}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down beside her. And then I added, smiling: [...] "Have you written to his mother?" ...|$|E
60|$|Such a Juno <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have {{described}} <b>sat</b> full in our view--a sort of mark for all eyes, and quite conscious that so she was, but proof to the magnetic influence of gaze or glance: cold, rounded, blonde, and beauteous {{as the white}} column, capitalled with gilding, which rose at her side.|$|R
60|$|Upon this, having {{told me what}} it was, he {{ran away}} to the Spanish servants, and told them what the meaning of it all was, and bade them go and satisfy their master, which they did, and all was well again; but, <b>as</b> for myself, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> up almost all the night staring out from {{the window at the}} {{eruption}} of fire upon the hills, for the like wonderful appearance I had never seen before.|$|R
60|$|We set out again, {{though not}} {{very early in}} the morning, having, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> said, <b>sat</b> up late, and drank freely over night, and we found, that after we had been gone to sleep it had rained very hard, and though the rain was over before we went out, yet the falling of the water from the hills made such a {{confused}} noise, and was echoed so backward and forward from all sides, that it was like a strange mixture of distant thunder, and though we knew the causes, yet it could not but be surprising to us for awhile.|$|R
