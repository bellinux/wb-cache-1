5|$|The Rynek Underground museum, {{under the}} main square, is an evocative modern display of Kraków's 1000+ {{years of history}} though its streets, {{activities}} and artifacts. This followed the massively extended excavations which started in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>way</b> in 2005 and, {{as more and more}} was found, ran on eventually to 2010.|$|E
5|$|Shaw {{married the}} Reverend John Millar, the parish {{minister}} of Kilmaurs, Ayrshire, in 1719. He {{died two years}} later, after which Shaw {{went on to become}} a successful businesswoman. She was involved in the manufacture of thread, at first in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>way,</b> but as the quality of her product began to be recognised, on an increasingly large scale. Her Bargarran trademark thread became a mark of quality, and others in the area began to emulate her techniques, starting an industry in which Paisley once dominated the world, and which shaped the town's history. The last known record of Shaw is her marriage in February 1737 to William Livingstone, a prosperous Edinburgh businessman.|$|E
5|$|Sinatra {{with a cold}} is Picasso without paint, Ferrari without fuel--only worse. For {{the common}} cold robs Sinatra of that uninsurable jewel, his voice, cutting into {{the core of his}} confidence, and it affects not only his own psyche but also seems to cause a kind of {{psychosomatic}} nasal drip within dozens of people who work for him, drink with him, love him, depend on him for their own welfare and stability. A Sinatra with a cold can, in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>way,</b> send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond as surely as a President of the United States, suddenly sick, can shake the national economy.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius blennius has a {{flattened}} convex cap that is 4–10cm (1.6–4in) across that later becomes depressed in the centre. In colour, it is pale olive to a greenish grey, sometimes a dull green or pale grey-sepia, and has blotches of darker colouration in concentric bands, though the colour can vary greatly. Heavily spotted specimens are also known, {{and a very}} brown specimen similar to Lactarius circellatus was recorded in Scotland. The cap is very slimy when moist and has a margin that is curved inwards. The stem is a paler colour than the cap, but also very slimy, and measures from 4–5cm (1.6–2in) tall by 1–1.7cm (0.4–0.7in) thick, tapering a little towards the bottom. The flesh is whitish, similar in colour to the gills, which later become a creamy or pale buff colour. The gills turn a brownish-grey colour when wounded, and are crowded. In shape, they are slightly decurrent or adnate, meaning that they run <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>way</b> down the stem in attachment, or that they {{are attached to the}} stem by the whole depth of the gills. The milk is white and dries grey, and is very plentiful. L.blennius spores leave a creamy print, and are elliptic with low warts joined by ridges with a small number of cross-connections, measuring from 6–9 by 5.5–7µm.|$|E

25|$|Braniff {{was given}} a {{contract}} to operate a military cargo flight between Brownsville, Texas, and Panama City/Balboa City, in the Canal Zone. The route was called the Banana Run because Braniff's pilots made agreements with the banana producers in Panama to move their bananas to the United States to sell. Because of the war, they could not fly their produce {{out of the country}} but Braniff devised at least <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>way</b> to assist the growers. Because of Braniff's superb service during the war and over the Banana Run, the Airline would be rewarded with a significant international route award just a year after the war ended.|$|E
25|$|Greece {{is said to}} {{have welcomed}} the most {{seasonal}} tourists from Serbia than any other country. While Athens and Thessaloniki are traditionally popular destinations for Serbs on vacation, tourist charters from Belgrade often channel Serbian travelers to Heraklion, Kos, Zakynthos, and other less densely populated destinations. Unlike English, German, and other foreign tourists, many of whom canceled their vacations in Greece due to protests and economical crisis in the summer of 2010, Serbian tourists broke the record, visiting the country in great numbers. The Serbian President stated, in Athens in June 2010, that this is how Serbia, in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>way,</b> is helping Greek friends during hard times for them.|$|E

25|$|Gordonstoun {{was started}} in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>way</b> and had {{financial}} difficulties in its early years. After the death in 1930 of Sir William Gordon-Cumming, 4th Baronet, his house at Gordonstoun was obtained by Kurt Hahn, whose offer for the lease was accepted on 14 March 1934. The buildings needed repair and renovation, and {{at the start of}} the first academic year, the school had only two enrolled pupils. Hahn expected Gordonstoun to operate for only a few years, as an example of his vision. The number of pupils steadily increased, and some additional pupils transferred from Salem, including Prince Philip of Greece, now the Duke of Edinburgh. By the start of the Second World War, 135 boys were attending.|$|E
25|$|On 6 July, the Russians bombarded the Ottoman {{ships and}} land positions. At about 12:30a.m. {{on the morning}} of 7 July, Orlov sent Samuel Greig (who {{transferred}} to Rostislav) to attack with Evropa, Rostislav and Ne tron menya forming a south-north line facing the Ottomans, and with Saratov in reserve, Nadezhda attacking the batteries at {{the eastern side of the}} bay entrance, Afrika attacking the batteries on the western side, and Grom near Afrika. At about 1:30a.m. or earlier (times were about 90 minutes earlier, according to Elphinstone), fire from Grom and/or Ne tron menya caused an Ottoman ship of the line to blow up after her main topsail caught fire, and the fire quickly spread to other ships of the line. By 2 a.m., two Ottoman ships of the line had blown up and more were on fire, and Greig sent in three fireships (the fourth, seeing the danger, stayed out), which contributed in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>way</b> to the burning of almost the entire Ottoman fleet. At about 4 a.m., boats were sent in to save two ships of the line which were not burning, but one of these caught fire while it was being towed. The other, Rodos 60, survived and was captured along with five galleys. Fighting ended at about 8 a.m.. Russian casualties on 5 July were 14 killed, plus 636 killed in Sv. Evstafii, and about 30 wounded, and on 7 July 11 killed. Ottoman casualties were much higher. Hüsameddin, Hasan Pasha and Cafer Bey survived. Hüsameddin was removed from his position, which was given to Cafer Bey. This was the only significant fleet battle during the Russo-Turkish War.|$|E
500|$|Priestley was {{considered}} for the position of astronomer on James Cook's second voyage to the South Seas, but was not chosen. Still, he contributed in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>way</b> to the voyage: he provided the crew with a method for making soda water, which he erroneously speculated might be a cure for scurvy. He then published a pamphlet with Directions for Impregnating Water with Fixed Air (1772). Priestley did not exploit the commercial potential of soda water, but others such as [...] made fortunes from it. In 1773, the Royal Society recognised Priestley's achievements in natural philosophy by awarding him the Copley Medal.|$|E

500|$|The gills are subdecurrent (running only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>way</b> {{down the}} length of the stem), close to crowded together, narrow, and {{sometimes}} forked near the stem. Their color is whitish, becoming pink-tinged, turning pale tan with age. The adult stem is [...] long, [...] thick, fragile, more or less equal in width throughout, and cylindrical or narrowed at the base. Its surface is dry, and either smooth to pruinose (covered with a very fine whitish powder on the surface). The color ranges from pale light pink to yellowish-tinged or slightly pinkish orange to orange white, sometimes spotted. The interior of the stem is firm, beige white, and filled with a soft pith, but it eventually becomes hollow. Occasionally, white mycelium is visible at the base of the stem where it meets the ground.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{there was}} a scene after the four had been reunited in the museum where Amy had a [...] "meltdown" [...] and Rory assured her it was okay; this was cut due to pacing issues, which pleased Darvill as he disliked his {{performance}} in the scene. Gillan stated that the episode was the [...] "most difficult" [...] for her, as it was [...] "a big climax for Amy and her story that's been building through the series...it just required a lot of kind of concentration and emotion." [...] In August 2011 she stated that the Doctor and Amy's farewell was the most emotional scene for her to film. The scene in which the Doctor gives a final speech to young Amelia was not filmed with Smith and Blackwood on the same set. Smith's dialogue was shot first in the bedroom set, while the corner with the bed was recreated and filmed with Blackwood as a pick-up. Blackwood fell asleep during filming. Amy and Rory's wedding reception was filmed at Miskin Manor. Gillan found wearing the dress strange, while Darvill {{felt as if he}} was gate-crashing someone else's wedding, as he did not know any of the extras there. Haynes wanted to first show the revelation that the TARDIS would appear at the reception in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>way</b> with minor changes such as the glasses tinkling and chandelier shaking, and build it up from there. Moffat thought that Amy would want a big wedding with a lot of dancing. In the script it was written that the Doctor was a [...] "terrible dancer" [...] and danced like a [...] "drunk giraffe", and Smith additionally came up with his own routine.|$|E
