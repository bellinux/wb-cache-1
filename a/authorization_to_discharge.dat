DCR received <b>authorization</b> <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> under the general permit from EPA on November 8, 2007 and from DEP on November 21, 2007.

DCR continues to work hard to implement a comprehensive storm water program this past year even with limited fiscal and labor resources. DCR storm water management efforts are supported by operating and capital appropriations that remained the same from FY 10 to FY 11 (July 2010 – June 2011) at $ 3. 9 million. DCR received federal stimulus funds that supplemented certain transportation related projects such as improvements to Nonantum Road, which was constructed by MADOT for DCR. DCR expects to utilize all available funds and to implement practices to reduce pollution in runoff from parks and parkways.
