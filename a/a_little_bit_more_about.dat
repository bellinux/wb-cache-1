500|$|Much of {{the lyrics}} were {{composed}} by Batmanglij and Koenig in Batmanglij's apartment (a former factory building in Brooklyn) and at a rented cottage on Martha's Vineyard. The lyrics explore more mature, world-weary themes such as growing old and disillusionment with American foreign policy. The album eschewed the theme of privileged youth from their first two albums in favor of characters with adult responsibilities and reflections on the passage of time. Faith and mortality are recurring themes on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", [...] "Worship You", and [...] "Everlasting Arms". Koenig likened their first three albums to Brideshead Revisited: [...] "The naïve joyous school days in the beginning. Then {{the expansion of the}} world, travel, seeing other places, learning <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> how people live. And then the end {{is a little bit of}} growing up, starting to think more seriously about your life and your faith. If people could look at our three albums as a bildungsroman, I’d be O.K. with that." [...] According to Brice Ezell from PopMatters, Modern Vampires of the City is [...] "very much an indie rock record" [...] because of Koenig's voice and diction, which reveals [...] "the youth that he and his bandmates so often strive to shrug off." [...] Ezell asserts that, on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", the [...] "reckless abandon" [...] expressed by the lyrics reveals [...] "the group's grasp on the genuine rebellion that indie rock ought to strive for." ...|$|E
500|$|Friends female {{characters}} {{had a profound}} influence on women's fashion during the 1990s, becoming household names as well as fashion icons. Monica, Rachel and Phoebe each [...] "became style icons for a generation of young women." [...] According to Desiree Tolentino of Verge Campus, [...] "Rachel and Monica were THE fashion icons back in the day", writing, [...] "Monica Geller’s vivacious style and sex appeal inspires every girl to care just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> what they wear, even if it’s moving boxes from one apartment to the other." [...] Describing Monica's wardrobe as [...] "classic and elegant," [...] Stylist observed that the character's first season bob cut was imitated by several woman, although its popularity paled in comparison to that of Aniston's iconic [...] "Rachel" [...] haircut, the widespread success of which Cox was jealous. However, Cosmopolitan identified Monica's hairstyle as [...] "Iconic in its own right", including in its list of [...] "20 iconic Friends hairstyles". Monica also became well known for accessorizing sweaters using scarves; on Cox's 51 birthday in 2015, Cosmopolitan published an article celebrating her character's best sweaters. BuzzFeed ranked Monica's wedding dress seventh on the website's list of the [...] "28 TV Show Wedding Dresses You’ll Always Envy", while Brides ranked it the ninth greatest wedding dress in television history. Us Weekly included it on their list of [...] "Celebrity Wedding Dresses: TV & Movies". Meanwhile, The Daily Telegraph cited several of Monica's outfits and hairstyles among the newspaper's list of [...] "Friends best fashion moments". According to Patricia Murphy of the Irish Independent, Monica [...] "is most definitely {{one of the most}} famous fictional telly chefs," [...] expounding, [...] "her OCD combined with her continuous strive for perfection making her a thoroughly enjoyable watch." [...] The Guardian ranked Monica fifth on the newspaper's list of [...] "The 10 best fictional chefs", while People ranked the character eighth, with author Grace Gavilanes writing, [...] "She's the best kind of chef – neurotic in the most entertaining/productive way, and always cleans up the mess in her kitchen." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{significant}} {{moment in}} the character's story came when Clark decided to play football in season four, providing conflict {{between him and his}} father. Writer Darren Swimmer refers to this moment as a [...] "... callback to ..." [...] in season one. To him, when Clark defies Jonathan and joins the team anyway, it signified the moment where Jonathan finally decided that he can trust Clark to not hurt anyone. Writer Todd Slavkin viewed it as Clark finally emerging from his father's shadow. Two more significant moments came during the following season. First, Clark lost his powers when he failed to return to Jor-El to finish his training; leaving him human and vulnerable. According to Welling, [...] "... learned <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> what it's like to be human, physically. Emotionally, he's pretty close to trying to understand that. It added more weight to his abilities once he got them back, and it made him realize his responsibilities for what he has." [...] The second moment came in the show's 100th episode, with the death of Clark's adoptive father. The decision to kill Jonathan was made so that Clark could finally step into his destiny, allowing Clark the boy to become Clark the man, as explained by Gough. In order to do that he needed his mentor to die, so that no one would buffer him from the world any longer. Welling saw the series' 100th episode as the chance for his character to evolve and grow. John Schneider saw the same catalyst for Clark's evolution. According to Schneider, Jonathan's death inspired Clark to make the move toward his eventual destiny. Jonathan provided such an example of sacrifice that it leaves a void in Clark. To fill that void Clark would have to become Superman. It was Schneider's contention that had Jonathan not been the man he was, when the time came that the world needed Superman, Clark would have been unable to take on that persona, because he would not realize that the world needed him.|$|E
2500|$|Landale {{also took}} part in the debates on the [...] "Young Plan" [...] during his service in the two Councils. The plan was named after the Governor of Hong Kong Sir Mark Young, who {{unveiled}} it in 1946. One of the major proposals as recommended in the plan was to establish a Municipal Council that would have a certain number of elected seats. Nevertheless, as the public opinion at the time could not agree on the breadth and depth of the constitutional reform, the plan was stalled for more than two years. It was already March 1949 when Landale moved a motion in the Legislative Council to revive the debate on the [...] "Young Plan". In the debate, he criticised the government for deliberately slowing down the pace of constitutional reform. He described the government as the [...] "Dormouse", a character in the novel Alice in Wonderland, which would wake up to disclose <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the whole story only when the [...] "Hatter" [...] pours hot tea upon its nose. Landale agreed that constitutional reform was needed for Hong Kong, but instead of supporting the [...] "Young Plan", he believed that reforming the Legislative Council would be a more practical alternative than setting up the Municipal Council. In June the same year, another unofficial member of the Legislative Council, Lo Man-kam, proposed his own reform plan, in which he argued that there should be more unofficial seats in the Legislative Council and some of these seats should be elected. This plan gained the support of all the unofficial members, who had by that time already made themselves clear that they opposed the [...] "Young Plan". Yet, having considered the regional instability and the lukewarm response from the general public, Young's successor, Sir Alexander Grantham, concluded that it was not an appropriate time to implement the reform plan. He particularly feared that Hong Kong would be drawn into the political row between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang if there was a constitutional reform. Finally, the British government told the Parliament in October 1952 that except for increasing the number of elected seats in the Urban Council, no major constitutional reform would take place in Hong Kong.|$|E

5000|$|Joel Kinnaman (Stephen Holder) {{spoke about}} the limits he has had with his {{character}} portrayal: [...] "Until the eighth episode of the first season, there was an architecture in the storytelling where they didn't want the audience to know if Holder was a good guy or a bad guy.

It wasn't until after the eighth episode that I felt I could be the character 100 percent, that I was allowed to react freely to situations.
