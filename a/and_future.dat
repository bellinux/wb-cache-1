This paper attempts to analyse the dynamic relationship between spot <b>and</b> <b>futures</b> prices of the crude oil, a very important commodity. The empirical analysis is focused to examine the causal dynamics between spot <b>and</b> <b>futures</b> prices in crude oil market; the results confirm that the prices of one <b>and</b> two maturity <b>futures</b> predict spot prices.

The empirical work is carried out using the economic modelling based on the VECM framework for spot <b>and</b> <b>futures</b> prices. Our findings show that there is some (but weak) evidence against the cost of carry relationship between spot <b>and</b> <b>futures</b> prices in both our sub periods. This research also found bidirectional causality between spot <b>and</b> <b>futures</b> prices with a stronger causality from futures to spot. Strong mean reversion was found in the returns of both spot <b>and</b> <b>futures</b> returns suggesting overreaction in spot <b>and</b> <b>futures</b> price to new information...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the hypothesis of}} Tilton et al. (2011) that assert investor demand affects commodity prices when spot <b>and</b> <b>futures</b> prices are closely correlated during strong contango in a hard commodity like copper. However, using daily data of crude palm oil (CPO) spot <b>and</b> <b>futures</b> prices from January 2000 to July 2016, after {{taking into account the}} variance of the increments in a random walk as measured by variance ratio, our study finds that spot <b>and</b> <b>futures</b> prices are highly correlated during backwardation period. It is further observed that: First, investor demand on the futures market is highly correlated with spot <b>and</b> <b>futures</b> prices during backwardation, but lesser during weak contango, and the least correlated during strong contango. Second, the efficiency of the futures market is related to the degree of correlation between spot <b>and</b> <b>futures</b> price changes. High efficient information transmission in the futures market is linked to a high correlation between spot <b>and</b> <b>futures</b> markets <b>and</b> vice versa. Therefore, we extend the hypothesis that the preference of holding a long position in the futures market is due to the anticipation of insufficient supply of CPO which happens during the backwardation period...|$|R

In this paper we apply standard forecast efficiency tests, and some newer exact sign and rank tests, {{to a wide}} range of forward <b>and</b> <b>futures</b> rates, <b>and</b> in this way test whether these are in fact rational expectations of future actual prices. The forward <b>and</b> <b>futures</b> rates that we study under a common methodology include foreign exchange forward rates, U.

It is well known that foreign exchange forward rates give less accurate forecasts than a random walk, but we show that this is also true for some interest rate <b>futures</b> <b>and</b> forward rates. We conclude that forward <b>and</b> <b>futures</b> prices are not generally pure measures of market expectations: they are also heavily affected by the market price of risk.
