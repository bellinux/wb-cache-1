Availability of <b>product</b> quality <b>information</b> is of key importance for this. We present {{a case study}} where an innovative sensor technology that provides estimates of an important meat quality feature is considered. Process design scenarios that differ with respect to sorting complexity, available <b>product</b> quality <b>information,</b> and use of temporary buffers are assessed using a discrete event simulation model. Results indicate that increasing sorting complexity by use of <b>advanced</b> <b>product</b> quality <b>information</b> results in a reduction of processing efficiency. Use of production buffers was found to increase processing flexibility and mitigate negative effects of high sorting complexity. This research illustrates how the use of <b>advanced</b> <b>product</b> quality <b>information</b> in logistics’ decision-making affects sorting performance, processing efficiency, and the optimal processing design, {{an area that has}} so far received little attention in literature...|$|R

To serve segmented customer demand meat processors consider use of innovative sensor technology to sort meat products to customer orders. To assess {{the use of this}} sensor technology a discrete-event simulation model is built. Various scenarios were defined for processing strategy (buffered or non-buffered), the number of end product groups to sort to and the availability of <b>product</b> quality <b>information.</b> The performance of these scenarios is measured w. r. t. order compliance, labor consumption and throughput-time. Our results reveal that the current processing and product sorting strategy is in-effective for sorting to a large number of end product groups. Furthermore, the current availability of <b>product</b> quality <b>information</b> is insufficient to ensure high levels of order compliance for <b>advanced</b> <b>product</b> quality products...|$|R

40|$|This licentiate thesis {{concerns}} <b>advanced</b> digital <b>product</b> catalogues, {{with the}} main focus on product presentation. A computer based digital product catalogue opens new possibilities for <b>advanced</b> <b>product</b> presentation and integration into the existing compute environment. Several new possibilities for product presentation become available. By use of photorealistic rendering techniques, images showing every different product design or combination can be displayed. The mechanical behavior of a product or an assembling instruction {{can be viewed as}} an animated sequence for achieving an even higher degree of understanding. The digital catalogue can interface with CAD systems for direct transfer of graphic- and alphanumeric <b>product</b> <b>information.</b> The main aim of this work is to evaluate ideas concerning product presentation {{for the next generation of}} digital product catalogues. Attention is also paid to program interaction and techniques for easier creation of computer-generated renderings. The ideas are exemplified through the development of two prototype systems. The functionality and interface layout of the developed prototype systems are studied by interviews and practical tests with presumptive users. The first system exemplifies an <b>advanced</b> digital <b>product</b> catalogue managing building components. It is capable of displaying photorealistic renderings showing all available products and product combinations as well as animated sequences. The second system demonstrates a digital product catalogue handling furniture. The digital catalogue makes it possible to display synthetic images of all available frame-fabric combinations. The persons interviewed have a positive attitude to the current digital product catalogues. The study performed shows some important matters for future development of digital product catalogues. A standardized and general format for managing <b>product</b> <b>information</b> would simplify the digital product catalogue issue. Furthermore, it is of great interest that an <b>advanced</b> digital <b>product</b> catalogue be capable of displaying images of all different products and product designs. If the product catalogue-managing program includes a photorealistic-rendering engine it is only necessary to distribute the geometry and surface definitions of the products included. This reduces the storage space needed significantly. The trend towards faster and less expensive computers is advantageous to this kind of systems...|$|R
40|$|Food supply chains have {{inherent}} characteristics, such as {{variability in}} product quality and quality decay, which put specific demands on logistics decision making. Furthermore, {{food supply chain}} organization and control has changed significantly in the past decades by factors such as scale intensification and globalization. In practice, these characteristics and developments frequently lead to supply chain problems, such as high levels of product waste, product quality problems, and high logistics costs. Recent technological developments have created the opportunity to gather, process, and communicate {{more information on the}} status of processes and products to support logistics decision making, providing business opportunities to realize performance improvements, and add extra value by differentiating products to specific market segments. This will, however, require the development of effective logistics management strategies that ensure the supply of products of appropriate quality in a cost-effective way to each stage of the supply chain. This thesis studies the use of <b>product</b> quality <b>information</b> in logistics decision making in food supply chains, captured in the following central research question: How can the effectiveness of logistics decision making in food supply chains be improved using <b>advanced</b> <b>product</b> quality <b>information?</b> This research question is investigated using four case studies: two {{in the context of the}} European Q-porkchains project (i. e. in pork supply chains), and two in the context of the European Veg-i-Trade project (i. e. in fruit- and vegetable supply chains). In these cases we investigated the impact of variability in product quality and quality decay on chain processes and studied if use of <b>product</b> quality <b>information</b> can improve logistics decision making regarding product sourcing and process design. In each case decision support models were developed – in close cooperation with industrial partners - to quantify the impact. Case study 1 : Process design for advanced sorting of meat products The first case study, presented in chapter 2, considers the process design of a meat processing company that seeks to add value by sorting meat products for a specific product quality feature. The relation between product sorting, processing efficiency and process design is investigated using a discrete event simulation model. Results indicate that increasing sorting complexity by use of <b>advanced</b> <b>product</b> quality <b>information</b> results in a reduction of processing efficiency, whereas use of production buffers was found to mitigate negative effects of high sorting complexity. The simulation allows practitioners facing segmented customer demand to assess which scenario offers the best trade-off between benefits and drawbacks resulting from efforts to improve responsiveness and flexibility. Case study 2 : Livestock sourcing decisions The second case study considers a meat processing company that faces quality feature variation in animals delivered to its slaughterhouses. To support sourcing decisions and ensure that the right product quality is received at its slaughterhouses two stochastic programming models are developed that exploit product quality data gathered during earlier deliveries. The presented implementations reveal that uncertainty in supplied product quality can be reduced using historical farmer delivery data, which improves processing performance. Case study 3 : Product sourcing in international strawberry supply chains The third case study relates to an international strawberry distributor that faces frequent product quality problems and substantial product waste. Different sourcing strategies were tested using a combination of both a slow, but cheap transport mode (i. e. sea and truck), and a faster, but more expensive mode (i. e. plane). The performance of these sourcing strategies is examined using a discrete-continuous chain simulation that includes microbiological growth models to predict quality decay. Simulation results reveal that standard cost parameters (that do not take quality decay into account) result in substantial product waste, but if cost for expected shelf-life losses are included in the order policies the effectiveness of product sourcing for the considered supply chain is improved. Case study 4 : Use of form postponement for food waste reduction The fourth case study concerns an international lettuce supply chain that struggles with effective product sourcing. Form postponement (FP) is a supply chain strategy which delays processing steps until a demand is realized. This allows a reduction of the total inventory in the supply chain. We studied supply chain scenarios that differ in where and when in the supply chain whole crop lettuce is converted into processed lettuce products. A discrete-continuous chain simulation model revealed that application of FP reduced both product waste and age and improves point-of-sale product quality. Integrated findings The findings of this thesis demonstrate that decision makers can improve logistics decisions and reduce food waste by using <b>product</b> quality <b>information</b> and predicting changes in product quality. The developed quantitative decision support models provided essential insights into trade-offs resulting from information-based supply chain performance improvement strategies. The presented case studies demonstrate that supply chain flexibility and responsiveness is required to reduce the impact of product variability and product quality decay. Increasing responsiveness and flexibility typically comes at the expense of other performance dimensions. This research demonstrates the potential of use of <b>product</b> quality <b>information</b> in food supply chain logistics, which may contribute to the effectiveness of food supply chains by improving consumer satisfaction, reducing overall costs, and reducing food waste...|$|R

40|$|Up until now, brick-and-mortar stores provide {{consumers}} with static <b>product</b> <b>information</b> {{in the form}} of printed product labels. This kind of <b>product</b> <b>information</b> does neither adapt to consumer needs nor facilitates new business models (e. g. consumer experience or ad hoc product bundling by products itself). By contrast, dynamic <b>product</b> <b>information</b> provided by mobile recommendation agents (MRA) may leverage these limitations. In this article we formulate a Simplified Consumer Choice (SCC) model that is used as a reference model for investigating dynamic <b>product</b> <b>information</b> provided by MRA.

In addition, we assess the SCC model according to decision making theory and analyze whether cognitive load can be reduced by the use of dynamic <b>product</b> <b>information</b> compared with static <b>product</b> <b>information.</b> An experiment (n= 37) was conducted to evaluate our hypotheses in which subjects were asked to buy a bundle of two compatible consumer products.

Several buildings in the downtown core were destroyed. The Sûreté du Québec confirmed the death of 47 people in the disaster. Through the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) Rapid <b>Information</b> <b>Products</b> and Services (RIPS) program, MDA developed value-added products that allowed stakeholders and all levels of government (municipal, provincial and federal) to get an accurate picture of the disaster. The goal of this RIPS Project was to identify the contribution that remote sensing technology can provide to disasters such as the train derailment and explosion at Lac-Mégantic through response and remediation monitoring. Through monitoring and analysis, the Lac-Mégantic train derailment response and remediation demonstrated how Earth observation data can be used for situational awareness in a disaster and in documenting the remediation process. Both high resolution optical and RADARSAT- 2 SAR image products were acquired and analyzed over the disaster remediation period as each had a role in monitoring. High resolution optical imagery provided a very clear picture of the current state of remediation efforts, however {{it can be difficult to}} acquire due to cloud cover and weather conditions. The RADARSAT- 2 SAR images can be acquired in all weather conditions at any time of day making it ideal for mission critical information gathering.

40|$|Email {{receipts}} (e-receipts) frequently record e-commerce transactions between {{users and}} online retailers, and contain {{a wealth of}} <b>product</b> <b>information.</b> Such information {{could be used in}} a variety of applications if it could be reliably extracted. However, extracting <b>product</b> <b>information</b> from e-receipts poses several challenges. For example, the high labor cost of annotating e-receipts makes traditional supervised approaches infeasible. E-receipts may also be generated from a variety of templates, and are usually encoded in plain text rather than HTML, making it difficult to discover the regularity of how <b>product</b> <b>information</b> is presented. In this paper, we present an approach that addresses all these challenges. Our approach is based on Markov logic [22], a language that combines probability and logic. From a corpus of unlabeled e-receipts, we identify all possible templates by jointly clustering the e-receipts and the lines in them. From the non-template portions of e-receipts, we learn patterns describing how <b>product</b> <b>information</b> is laid out, and use them to extract the <b>product</b> <b>information.</b> Experiments on a corpus of real-world e-receipts demonstrate that our approach performs well.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} impact of online <b>product</b> <b>information</b> on consumers, firms and markets. The first chapter of this dissertation proves that better access to <b>product</b> <b>information</b> increases consumer demand and their willingness-to-pay, leading to a new era where firms can charge higher prices and where consumers are empowered with more choices and information to make better decisions. ^ One of the major difficulties in studying descriptive <b>product</b> <b>information</b> is its immeasurability. Unlike price information, which can be easily quantified, descriptive <b>product</b> <b>information</b> has many dimensions that {{are not subject to}} clear definition or to the control that is often needed in empirical research. The second and third chapters of this dissertation provide two approaches for empirical research on descriptive <b>product</b> <b>information.</b> ^ The second chapter studies whether online <b>product</b> <b>information</b> increases consumer demand. However, as long as a consumer 2 ̆ 7 likelihood of searching for information is correlated with his demand for music CDs, a direct comparison between the two groups of consumers will yield biased results. This chapter employs a simultaneous equation model to explicitly model both consumer demand for music CDs and consumers 2 ̆ 7 search for online <b>product</b> <b>information.</b> The result proves <b>product</b> <b>information</b> does increase consumer demand. Equally important, however, the result shows that ignoring the self-selection issue will dramatically overestimate the potential impact. ^ The third chapter examines {{the impact of}} third-party ratings of online bookstores 2 ̆ 7 service quality on consumer loyalty to those bookstores. Adopting a different approach from the second chapter, we consider a case where information is provided exogenously. Using the aggregative market share model and the individual consumer discrete choice model, the third chapter shows that consumer loyalty in online book retailing environment is mainly due to lack of information of service quality. ...|$|R
