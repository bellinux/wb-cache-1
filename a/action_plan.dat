40|$|Objective: <b>Action</b> <b>planning</b> is {{regarded}} as an important correlate and predictor of health behaviour, but {{little is known about}} antecedents of <b>action</b> <b>planning.</b> Because personality constructs have been shown to moderate the effect of <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> interventions, the present study tested associations of personality dimensions with <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> and fruit consumption. Design and setting: Cross-sectional data collected with self-administered questionnaires in a university setting. Method: Undergraduate students (n = 443; mean age = 21. 45 (SD = 2. 96) years, 68. 7 % females) who participated for course credits and completed measures of personality dimensions, <b>action</b> <b>planning,</b> intention, and fruit consumption based on validated questionnaires. The first set of analyses focused on antecedents of fruit consumption <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> employing stepwise regression analysis. The second set of analyses focused on intention and <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> as mediators of the personality-fruit consumption link using structural equation modelling. Results: Higher scores for fruit consumption <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> were found for more conscientiousness and less neurotic individuals. Further, more conscientious individuals consumed more fruits and this relationship was mediated by <b>action</b> <b>planning.</b> Conclusion: Findings provide support for <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> as a mediator in the Conscientiousness-fruit consumption link and suggest that personality influences may need {{to be taken into account}} when developing <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> strategies aimed at increasing fruit consumption...|$|R
40|$|Both habit {{strength}} and <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> {{have been found}} to moderate the intention-exercise behaviour relationship, but no research exists that has investigated how habit {{strength and}} <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> simultaneously influence this relationship. The present study was designed to explore this issue in a prospective sample of undergraduate students (N = 415) : <b>action</b> <b>planning,</b> habit strength, intention, attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control were assessed at baseline and exercise behaviour was assessed 2 weeks later. Both habit strength and <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> moderated the intention-exercise relationship, with stronger relationship at higher levels of planning or habit strength. Decomposing a significant <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> × habit strength × intention interaction showed that the strength of the intention-exercise relationship progressed linearly through levels of <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> and habit strength. These novel results show that <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> strengthens the intention-habit strength interaction in the exercise domain: exercise interventions should therefore focus on simultaneously bolstering <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> and habit strength...|$|R

50|$|Principle 4: Two {{kinds of}} mental simulation.

The separation of the planning construct into two constructs, <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> and coping planning, has been found useful as studies have confirmed the discriminant validity of such a distinction. <b>Action</b> <b>planning</b> seems to be more important for the initiation of health behaviors, whereas coping planning is required for the initiation and maintenance of actions as well.|$|R

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{development}} of <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> in a group of typically developing children aged 3 to 10 years (N= 351). The second aim was to assess reliability of the <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> task and to relate the results of the <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> task to results of validated upper limb motor performance tests. Participants performed an <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> task in which they needed to grasp an object (a wooden play sword) and place it into a tight-fitting hole. Our main dependent variable was the grip type that participants used; that is, we measured whether initial grip was adapted in such a way that children reached a comfortable posture at the end of the action (the end-state comfort effect). Older children <b>planned</b> their <b>actions</b> more often in line with the end-state comfort effect compared with younger children. Test-retest and interrater reliability of the <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> task were good, with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of. 90 and. 95, respectively. We compared the <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> task with manual dexterity tests in a subset of participants (n= 197). We found a marginal relation with the manual dexterity tests, indicating that the <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> task measures different processes. In sum, our study showed that <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> increases from 3 to 10 years of age and that the experimental task we used is reliable in assessing anticipatory planning. Therefore, it may be used as a reliable additional test to investigate the degree to which motor behavior is affected at the cognitive level of anticipatory planning...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop and test reliability, validity, and utility of the Goal-Setting Evaluation Tool for Diabetes (GET-D). The {{effectiveness}} of diabetes self-management is predicated on goal-setting and <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> strategies. Evaluation of self-management interventions is hampered by the absence of tools to assess quality of goals and <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> To address this gap, we developed the GET-D, a criteria-based, observer rating scale that measures the quality of patients’ diabetes goals and <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> Methods We conducted 3 -stage development of GET-D, including identification of criteria for observer ratings of goals and <b>action</b> <b>plans,</b> rater training and pilot testing; and then performed psychometric testing of the GET-D. Results Trained raters could effectively rate the quality of patient-generated goals and <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> using the GET-D. Ratings performed by trained evaluators demonstrated good raw agreement (94. 4 %) and inter-rater reliability (Kappa = 0. 66). Scores on the GET-D correlated well with measures theoretically associated with goal-setting, including patient activation (r=. 252, P Conclusions The GET-D can reliably and validly rate the quality of goals and <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> It holds promise as a measure of intervention fidelity for clinical interventions that promote diabetes self-management behaviors to improve clinical outcomes.

40|$|Background: Mainstreaming of gender, equity, {{and human}} rights (GER) is an {{important}} focus of the World Health Organization (WHO) and other UN organizations. This paper explores the role of <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> in mainstreaming GER. This paper is informed by a theory-driven evaluation lens. Design: A theory of change framework explored the following seven dimensions of how <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> can implement mainstreaming of GER: awareness of the foundations of GER; understanding of context; planning to impact GER; implementation for GER; monitoring, evaluation, and learning; planning for sustainability; agenda setting and buy-in. The seven dimensions were {{used to analyze the}} <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> Reviewers also explored innovations within each of the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> for the seven dimensions. Results: GER mainstreaming is more prominent in the foundation, background, and planning components of the plan but becomes less so along the theory of change including implementation; monitoring and evaluation; sustainability; and agenda setting and buy-in. Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates that much more can be done to incorporate GER considerations into the <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> process. Nine specific recommendations are identified for WHO and other organizations. A theory-driven approach as described in the paper is potentially helpful for developing clarity by which <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> can help with mainstreaming GER considerations...|$|R
40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{reported}} that appraisal by peers can be effective. Aim: To investigate whether feedback from a peer group (PG) compared to that by a staff member during a practice visit (PV) is as effective in improving the quality of <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> Methods: Seventy-three general practitioner (GP) trainers randomized into either a PG or PV were instructed to draw up <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> using the SMART criteria to realize the goals set in their personal development plans (PDPs). To improve <b>action</b> <b>plans,</b> feedback was given in either PG or PV. Quality of baseline and follow-up <b>action</b> <b>plans,</b> operationalized as the SMARTness with which plans were formulated, was assessed using a study-specific instrument. Results: Response rate for submitting both baseline and follow-up <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> was 89 % in the PG versus 79 % in the PV. It was feasible to determine scores on all SMART criteria, except for the criterion 'Acceptability'. Significant improvement was made on the remaining four criteria irrespective of the feedback setting. Conclusions: PGs cost less and seem equally effective in improving the SMARTness of the <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> Moreover, they also seem to stimulate GP trainers more to write a PDP.
