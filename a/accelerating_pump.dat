40|$|Qualitative {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} use of the NACA injection impeller with the R- 3350 engine increases the inertia of the fuel-injection system and, when the standard fuel-metering system is used, this increase in inertia results in poor engine acceleration characteristics. This investigation was therefore undertaken to determine whether satisfactory acceleration characteristics of the engine equipped with the injection impeller could be obtained by simple modifications to the fuel-monitoring system. The engine was operated with two types of carburetor; namely, a hydraulic-metering carburetor incorporating a vacuum-operated <b>accelerating</b> <b>pump</b> and a direct-metering carburetor having a throttle-actuated <b>accelerating</b> <b>pump.</b> The vacuum-operated <b>accelerating</b> <b>pump</b> of the hydraulic-metering carburetor was modified to produce satisfactory accelerations by supplementing the standard air chamber with an additional 75 -cubic spring. The throttle-actuated <b>accelerating</b> <b>pump</b> of the direct-metering carburetor was modified to produce satisfactory accelerations by replacing the standard 0. 028 -inch-diameter bleed in the load-compensator balance line with a smaller bleed of 0. 0225 -inch diameter. The results of this investigation indicated that both carburetors can be easily modified to produce satisfactory acceleration characteristics of the engine and no definite choice between the types of carburetor and <b>accelerating</b> <b>pump</b> can be made. Use of the direct-metering carburetor, however, probably resulted in better fuel distribution to the cylinders during the acceleration period and reduced the backfire hazard because all the fuel is introduced through the injection impeller...|$|E

They operate at much lower pressures and higher flow rates than radial-flow (centripetal) pumps. Axial-flow pumps cannot be run up to speed without special precaution. If at a low flow rate, the total head rise and high torque associated with this pipe would mean that the starting torque would have to become a function of acceleration for the whole mass of liquid in the pipe system.

40|$|The strong {{demand for}} {{renewable}} energy promotes research on novel methods and technologies for energy conversion. Microfluidic systems for energy conversion by streaming current are less known to the public, and the relatively low efficiencies previously obtained seemed to limit the further applications of such systems. Here we report a microdroplet-based electrostatic generator operating by an acceleration-deceleration cycle ('ballistic' conversion), and show that this principle enables both high efficiency and compact simple design. Water is <b>accelerated</b> by <b>pumping</b> it through a micropore to form a microjet breaking up into fast-moving charged droplets. Droplet kinetic energy is converted to electrical energy when the charged droplets decelerate in the electrical field that forms between membrane and target. We demonstrate conversion efficiencies of up to 48 %, a power density of 160 kWm(- 2) and both high- (20 kV) and low- (500 V) voltage operation.

40|$|The light-driven pump Halorhodopsin (hR) {{uses the}} energy stored in an initial meta-stable state (K), {{in which the}} bound retinal {{chromophore}} has been photoisomerized from all-trans to 13 -cis, to drive the translocation of one chloride anion across the membrane. Thus far {{it was unclear whether}} retinal twisting or charge separation between the positive Schiff base of the retinal and the chloride anion is the primary mechanism of energy storage. Here, combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations show that the energy is predominantly stored by charge separation. However, a large variability in retinal twisting is observed, thus reconciling the contradictory hypotheses for storage. Surprisingly, the energy stored in the K-state amounts to only one-fifth of the photon energy. We explain why the protein cannot store more: even though this would <b>accelerate</b> chloride <b>pumping,</b> raising the K-state also reduces the relative energy barriers against unproductive decay, in particular via the premature cis to trans back-isomerization. Indeed, the protein has maximized its storage so that the back-isomerization barriers are just high enough (≥ 18 kcal/mol) to keep the decay rate (1 / 100 ms) slower than the remaining photocycle (1 / 20 ms). This need to stabilize the captured photon-energy until it can be used in subsequent steps is inherent to light-driven proteins...|$|R
50|$|When {{starting}} out in Drive range, low gear was automatically selected {{and the low}} band applied under pressure modulated by a vacuum modulator which sensed engine output and adjusted clutch and band apply pressures to provide smooth engagement without slip. As the vehicle <b>accelerated,</b> rear <b>pump</b> output would increase and initiate a shift to direct. The rear pump pressures were modified by a throttle valve, and governor, both of which could delay the upshift, or even trigger a forced downshift at driver command. Full throttle downshifts were achieved by the throttle valve which permitted the transmission to stay in low range or be forced into downshifting to speeds between 45 - 50 mph. At speeds under 35 mph, heavy throttle would delay upshifts, or initiate a forced 'detent touch' kickdown for better performance. When Low Range or Reverse are selected, the apply pressures are not modulated and the full line pressure of the transmission is applied to ensure positive engagement. The multiple plate reverse clutch and double wrap low band design offered a slight buffer to engagement to prevent harshness even under high apply pressures. A quite sophisticated valve body timed shifts and apply pressures carefully in Drive range to ensure smoothness and prevent 'hunting' between gears, which is a common complaint of small cars with automatic transmission. Corvair Powerglides had a good reputation for reliability and were ordered on {{a large majority of}} Corvair passenger cars.|$|R
30|$|Over {{the past}} decades, {{a large number}} of {{investigations}} have been carried out to study various natural and engineering systems and processes that involve fluid flow through porous media [1 – 5], such as petroleum extraction, where the flow <b>accelerates</b> toward the <b>pumping</b> well while crossing regions of variable porosity, and a turbulent regime eventually occurs and affects the overall pressure drop and well performance. Dybbs and Edwards [1] conducted a flow visualization study, and they showed that fluid flow in a porous medium exhibits turbulent characteristics when the pore-Reynolds number (based on the pore scale and velocity) becomes higher than a few hundred. Leibenson [5] introduced a p-Laplacian equation to describe turbulent flows in a porous medium. Inspired by the above work, many authors studied the existence and uniqueness of solution for differential equation involving p-Laplacian under various boundary conditions, here we refer the reader to the work of Li et al. [6], Chen et al. [7], Zhang et al. [8 – 10], Goodrich [11, 12], Ding et al. [13], and the references therein.|$|R
40|$|Planktonic {{ecosystems}} {{provide a}} key {{mechanism for the}} transfer of CO 2 from the atmosphere to the deep ocean via the so-called ”biological pump”. Mathematical models of these ecosystems {{have been used to}} predict CO 2 up-take in surface waters, and more recently have been embedded in global climate models. While the equilibrium properties of these models are well studied, less {{attention has been paid to}} their response to external perturbations, despite the fact that, as a result of the variability of environmental forcing, such ecosys-tems are rarely, if ever, in equilibrium. Human induced perturbations to these ecosystems, namely the addition of limiting nutrients (e. g. iron) to areas where nitrate is plentiful to <b>accelerate</b> the biological <b>pump,</b> have been proposed as a solution to reduce atmospheric CO 2. In this study, linear theory is used to de-termine the structure of initially ”unit-norm ” perturbations to state variables of a five state variable ecosystem model in steady state, describing Ocean Sta-tion P (50 ◦N 145 ◦W) in summer, that optimize either instantaneous export flux of organic matter at fixed times or integrated export as the ecosystem relaxes towards equilibrium. A common feature in the optimization experi-ments for both instantaneous and integrated flux is the synchronization of the oscillatory behavior between two state variables. Because of these oscillations, there is an indirect contribution to the export flux that is non-intuitive. For all perturbations, it is found that the flux to higher trophic levels is the primary contributor to export flux, and, contrary to expectations, the contribution of aggregation is negligible. 1 1...|$|R
40|$|Lactic acid {{accumulation}} {{is generally}} {{believed to be}} involved in muscle fatigue. However, one study reported that in rat soleus muscle (in vitro), with force depressed by high external K+ concentrations a subsequent incubation with lactic acid restores force and thereby protects against fatigue. However, incubation with 20 mm lactic acid reduces the pH gradient across the sarcolemma, whereas the gradient is increased during muscle activity. Furthermore, unlike active muscle the Na+–K+ pump is not activated. We therefore hypothesized that lactic acid does not protect against fatigue in active muscle. Three incubation solutions were used: 20 mm Na-lactate (which acidifies internal pH), 12 mm Na-lactate + 8 mm lactic acid (which mimics the pH changes during muscle activity), and 20 mm lactic acid (which acidifies external pH more than internal pH). All three solutions improved force in K+-depressed rat soleus muscle. The pH regulation associated with lactate incubation <b>accelerated</b> the Na+–K+ <b>pump.</b> To study whether the protective effect of lactate/lactic acid is a general mechanism, we stimulated muscles to fatigue with and without pre-incubation. None of the incubation solutions improved force development in repetitively stimulated muscle (Na-lactate had a negative effect). It is concluded that although lactate/lactic acid incubation regains force in K+-depressed resting muscle, a similar incubation has no or a negative effect on force development in active muscle. It is suggested that {{the difference between the two}} situations is that lactate/lactic acid removes the negative consequences of an unusual large depolarization in the K+-treated passive muscle, whereas the depolarization is less pronounced in active muscle...|$|R
40|$|High-affinity {{potassium}} uptake in Neurospora occurs by symport with protons [Km (apparent) = 15 microM at pH 5. 8], {{for which}} a large inward gradient (approximately 400 mV) is generated by the H+-extruding ATPase of the plasma membrane. Operating in parallel, the two transport systems yield a net 1 : 1 exchange of K+ for cytoplasmic H+. Since this exchange could {{play a role in}} cytoplasmic pH (pHi) regulation, the coordinated functioning of the K+-H+ symport and H+ pump has been examined during acid stress. Cytoplasmic acid loads were imposed by injection and by exposure to extracellular permeant weak acid. Multibarrelled microelectrodes were used to monitor membrane potential (Vm), pHi, and the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the cells. The behaviors of the H+ pump and K+-H+ symport were resolved, respectively, by fitting whole membrane I-V curves to an explicit kinetic model of the Neurospora membrane and by subtracting I-V curves obtained in the absence from those obtained in the presence of 5 - 200 microM K+ outside. Proton <b>pumping</b> <b>accelerates</b> nearly in proportion with the cytoplasmic H+ concentration, but pHi recovery from imposed acid loads is dependent on micromolar K+ outside. Potassium import via the symport leads to a measurable alkalinization of the cytoplasm in accordance with stoichiometric (1 : 1) K+/H+ exchange. Potassium transport is accelerated at low pHi, but {{in a manner consistent with}} its inherent voltage sensitivity and changes in Vm resulting from an increased rate of H+ extrusion by the pump. The primary response to acid stress thus rests with the H+ pump, but K+ transport introduces an essential kinetic "valve" that can regulate net H+ export...|$|R
40|$|Intracellular Local Ca {{releases}} (LCRs) from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) regulate {{cardiac pacemaker}} cell function by activation of electrogenic Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) during diastole. Prior studies demonstrated {{the existence of}} powerful compensatory mechanisms of LCR regulation via a complex local cross-talk of Ca pump, release and NCX. One major obstacle to study these mechanisms is that LCR exhibit complex Ca release propagation patterns (including merges and separations) {{that have not been}} characterized. Here we developed new terminology, classification, and computer algorithms for automatic detection of numerically simulated LCRs and examined LCR regulation by SR Ca pumping rate (Pup) that provides a major contribution to fight-or-flight response. In our simulations the faster SR Ca <b>pumping</b> <b>accelerates</b> action potential-induced Ca transient decay and quickly clears Ca under the cell membrane in diastole, preventing premature releases. Then the SR generates an earlier, more synchronized, and stronger diastolic LCR signal activating an earlier and larger inward NCX current. LCRs at higher Pup exhibit larger amplitudes and faster propagation with more collisions to each other. The LCRs overlap with Ca transient decay, causing an elevation of the average diastolic [Ca] nadir to ~ 200 nM (at Pup = 24 mM/s). Background Ca (in locations lacking LCRs) quickly decays to resting Ca levels (< 100 nM) at high Pup, but remained elevated during slower decay at low Pup. Release propagation is facilitated at higher Pup by a larger LCR amplitude, whereas at low Pup by higher background Ca. While at low Pup LCRs show smaller amplitudes, their larger durations and sizes combined with longer transient decay stabilize integrals of diastolic Ca and NCX current signals. Thus, the local interplay of SR Ca pump and release channels regulates LCRs and Ca transient decay to insure fail-safe pacemaker cell operation within a wide range of rates...|$|R
40|$|Methane, {{which is}} at least partly stored in the bottom sediments of Lake Baikal as gas hydrates, is {{released}} on the lake floor in the deeper parts of the basin along major faults, forming venting structures similar to small mud volcanoes. The CH 4 venting structures {{are considered to be}} the surface expression of escape pathways for excess CH 4 generated by the dissociation of pre-existing hydrates. The existence of a local heat flow anomaly associated with the seep area is most likely due to a heat pulse causing the dissociation of the underlying gas hydrates. The heat pulse may be caused by upward flow of geothermal fluids along segments of active faults, possibly <b>accelerated</b> by seismic <b>pumping.</b> It is assumed that this fluid flow is tectonically triggered, considering that left-lateral strike-slip movements along the border faults act as a major factor in fluid accumulation: even a reduced lateral displacement is able to generate fluid flow in the compressional direction, resulting in fluid escape along faults directed along the main direction of extension. The tectonic effect may be coupled to the sediment compaction due to a high sedimentation rate in the area of mud volcanism. Both processes may generate a large-scale convective fluid loop within the basin-fill sediments which advects deeper gases and fluids to the shallow sub-surface. Even in the extensional tectonic environment of Lake Baikal, local compressional forces related to a strike-slip component, {{may play a role in}} fluid flow, accumulation and gas escape along active faults. The mechanisms that result in the expulsion of the CH 4 in the Lake Baikal sediments are considered as an analogue of what could happen during CO 2 sequestration in a similar tectonic environment...|$|R
40|$|Two {{decades after}} the {{construction}} of the first major dam, the Mekong basin and its six riparian countries have seen rapid economic growth and development of the river system. Hydropower dams, aggregate mines, flood-control dykes, and groundwater-irrigated agriculture have all provided short-term economic benefits throughout the basin. However, it is becoming evident that anthropic changes are significantly affecting the natural functioning of the river and its floodplains. We now ask if these changes are risking major adverse impacts for the 70 million people living in the Mekong Basin. Many livelihoods in the basin depend on ecosystem services that will be strongly impacted by alterations of the sediment transport processes that drive river and delta morpho-dynamics, which underpin a sustainable future for the Mekong basin and Delta. Drawing upon ongoing and recently published research, we provide an overview of key drivers of change (hydropower development, sand mining, dyking and water infrastructures, climate change, and <b>accelerated</b> subsidence from <b>pumping)</b> for the Mekong’s sediment budget, and their likely individual and cumulative impacts on the river system. Our results quantify {{the degree to which the}} Mekong delta, which receives the impacts from the entire connected river basin, is increasingly vulnerable in the face of declining sediment loads, rising seas and subsiding land. Without concerted action, it is likely that nearly half of the Delta’s land surface will be below sea level by 2100, with the remaining areas impacted by salinization and frequent flooding. The threat to the Delta can be understood only in the context of processes in the entire river basin. The Mekong River case can serve to raise awareness of how the connected functions of river systems in general depend on undisturbed sediment transport, thereby informing planning for other large river basins currently embarking on rapid economic development...|$|R
40|$|The {{government}} often {{relies on}} targeted subsidies for both “green” energy and hydrocarbons. These subsidies pursue worthwhile goals. But unfortunately, many have design flaws {{that make them}} less effective or even counterproductive. The goal of this Article is to show how we can do better. This Article focuses on three sets of issues. First, there often is tension between our environmental and national security goals. Unfortunately, the economics literature on energy largely ignores these tradeoffs by omitting national security from the analysis. This Article takes issue with this approach and suggests ways to manage these tradeoffs. Second, as a strategy {{to deal with these}} and other costs, this Article criticizes subsidies, and argues that Pigouvian taxes are a better alternative. Third, if we are stuck with subsidies for political reasons, this Article offers a number of ways to improve them. The U. S. faces increased defense costs in securing access to oil, for instance, in deploying forces in the Middle East. Yet the economics literature on energy does not account for these national security costs, arguing that they are too difficult to quantify. Even so, difficulties in computing costs are not a reason to ignore them. This Article argues that national security costs need to be incorporated in the analysis, and considers ways to manage tradeoffs between these costs and environmental externalities. The best way to manage these tradeoffs is with Pigouvian taxes. For instance, we should have a national security tax, a carbon tax, as well as a pollution tax. But instead of this menu of Pigouvian taxes, the U. S. has relied on targeted subsidies for particular technologies. While other commentators have criticized this choice, this Article offers a different critique, based on administrative costs, that is new to the literature. Since producers and consumers can increase (or decrease) negative externalities in a multiplicity of ways, the cost (or reward) should be the same, regardless of how they do it. But this Article shows why consistency is easier for taxes than for subsidies. While taxes have to reach all sources of harm, subsidies have to reach all ways to mitigate harm, which is a much longer list. To be comprehensive, we would have to subsidize driving more efficient vehicles, driving less, driving slowly, <b>accelerating</b> evenly, <b>pumping</b> up the tires, carpooling, taking mass transit, and much more. As a practical matter, this is not feasible. If we are stuck with subsidies for political reasons, this Article offers a number of ways to improve them. For example, subsidies should be precise in rewarding the desired behavior, instead of a proxy for it. Otherwise, the subsidy can have perverse effects. For instance, Congress pays 2. 3 cents for each kWh of electricity generated with wind. To claim this subsidy, producers sometimes generate electricity that no one needs, and then pay customers to take it. This perverse effect arises because this subsidy rewards a proxy (producing wind energy), instead of the desired result (replacing carbon-based energy) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the Toarcian (Early Jurassic; ~ 183 Myr ago), the ocean-atmosphere {{system was}} subject {{to one of the}} larg- est {{perturbations}} of the carbon cycle in the last 250 Myr known as the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T- OAE). This event was accompanied by a - 6 ‰ negative carbon-isotope excursion (CIE) caused by massive injection of isotopically light carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system, possibly from destabilisation of gas hydrates. This study reveals the pacing and sequence of events leading up to the CIE and to widespread de position of organic-rich sediments. The very high-resolution isotopic record from exceptionally well- preserved carbonate and organic matter from the Paris Basin enables recognition of increased CO 2 levels ~ 130 kyr in advance of the major negative CIE. An accelerated increase in the pCO 2 is registered ~ 25 kyr be- fore the onset of this negative excursion and was so rapid and so intense that it led to a water column under-saturated with respect to calcium carbonate in the Paris Basin. Undersaturation is expressed as a dramatic drop in the accumulation of the biogenic calcite produced by the surface-dwelling calcifiers. These environ- mental perturbations, representing precursor phases of CO 2 injection, predate the first step towards relative- ly light carbon-isotope in carbonate and organic matter and are tentatively attributed to Karoo-Ferrar magmatism. This negative shift was registered slightly earlier in terrestrial carbon than marine carbonate. Subsequent global warming is credited with liberating isotopically light carbon, and ultimately fostered an- oxia in the Paris Basin: the response of these cumulative inputs of carbon to the Earth system. Isotopic and sedimentological evidence indicates continuously elevated phytoplanktonic productivity throughout the first step of the negative CIE, suggesting that the biological <b>pump</b> <b>accelerated</b> the drawdown of excess carbon leading to temporary recovery of carbonate sedimentation, ~ 45 kyr after the first step of the CIE. This re- establishment of the saturation state of the water column was only fleeting before the later stepwise release of isotopically light carbon...|$|R
