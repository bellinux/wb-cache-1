5|$|This {{theory is}} debatable; Hermann Alexander Schlögl, Wolfgang Helck, Peter Kaplony and Jochem Kahl {{argue that the}} clay seals were only found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> area of Peribsen's tomb {{and none of them}} depict Peribsen and Sekhemib's names {{together}} in one inscription. Furthermore, they remark that it was customary for a pharaoh to bury and seal his predecessor's tomb; the presence of Sekhemib's seals show the line of dynastic inheritance. Similar inferences can be drawn from the ivory tablets of king Hotepsekhemwy found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> of king Qa'a's tomb and the clay seals of Djoser found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> of Khasekhemwy's tomb. Schlögl, Helck, Kaplony and Kahl are convinced that the discovery of Sekhemib's seals support the view that Sekhemib immediately succeeded Peribsen and buried him.|$|E
