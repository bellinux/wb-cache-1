5000|$|Because of {{the nature}} of thermal wheels in the way that heat is {{transferred}} from the exhaust air stream to the supply air stream without having to pass directly through an exchange medium, the gross efficiencies are usually much higher than that of any other air-side heat recovery system.

The electricity increase is 6 kWh of energy. In the summer, the energy savings are 17 to 38 kWh, with the electricity increase 8 kWh of energy. The second VS, i. e. system combining ventilation a solar systems, the calculation was carried out in TRNSYS computer program for two objects - a “low-energy house” (LEH) and “two-floor house” (TFH) - and 6 different solar systems modifications. The energy gains at the LEH for the 3 solar modif. are 49, 59 and 46 kWh per year (yearly consumption for heating is 2622 kWh). The energy gains at the TFH for the 3 solar modif. are 86, 134 and 129 kWh (yearly consumption for the heating is 8988 kWh). The third VS is a residential VS with liquid circuit with two compact “heat exchangers” (HE) at the inlet and outlet air.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the service life of respiratory cartridges {{it is important to}} understand the characteristics of human inspiration. Therefore, a new method had to be developed to simulate human inspiration. These data can be used to program "artificial lungs" for the determination of the service life of respiratory cartridges. The aim of this study was to develop a method for morphological analysis of human respiration using polynomial regression. The inspiratory curves of 13 healthy male volunteers (age (median) : 25 years) were analyzed. The volunteers participated in two sessions, one with and the other without using a respiratory cartridge. In each session the subjects were exposed to different levels of physical load (0 W, 50 W, 100 W, 150 W, (175 W), 200 W, (225 W) and 250 W) using a stationary bicycle. During each session the <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> was continuously recorded. For each level of physical load the last 10 inspiratory curves have been used for further analysis. Polynomial regression (11 th order) was applied using a software program developed by the author. To describe changes in inspiratory acceleration and retardation the first derivation of the polynomial function was used. In order to be able to compare inspiratory curves with different duration the extrema of the polynomial function were related to the total length of inspiration. At levels of physical load from 0 to 175 W a median of three maxima of the inspiratory curves has been observed. While using the respiratory cartridge only one maximum was seen in the last level of physical load (250 W; n = 30 inspiratory curves). The maximum <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> did not differ significantly between the levels of physical load with and without using a respiratory cartridge. However, with increasing physical load the maximum <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> increased. The respiratory frequency, duration of inspiration, tidal volume and airflow volume per minute were comparable to previous studies. In conclusion, the use of polynomial regression models might be helpful for morphological analysis of human inspiration using large data sets. Future studies including a larger number of subjects should be performed in order to confirm the shape of the inspiratory curves during different levels of physical load. The application and further development of the described method might lead to better testing procedures for the evaluation of the service life of respiratory cartridges...|$|E

40|$|In {{commercial}} buildings the building services systems {{may account for}} {{a substantial part of}} the need of energy. There is, at least in Sweden, a large existing stock of 20 to 30 year old office buildings, which are supplied with centralised constant <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> (CAV) air conditioning systems with the primary function to keep the room temperature at an acceptable level summertime. However, since the heat loads are only occasionally at the peak level, considerable amounts of energy can be wasted during periods when cooling is not needed or when rooms are not in use. Substantial energy savings can be achieved by changing the system to variable <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> (VAV) operation. Nevertheless, such a change becomes meaningful only if the system as a whole is adapted to the new configuration. The aim of this work is to clarify the prerequisites for a well functioning VAV system in office buildings. A special focus has been that the system solutions should be uncomplicated and possible to implement in existing buildings as well as in new ones. Adopting VAV in office buildings without having to install active control dampers in the duct system is one way of building up a simple VAV system. To obtain this, some special demands must be set upon the VAV variable supply air diffusers. They must have good controlling properties and a low noise level even at a high pressure drop over the device. Also, a comfortable airflow pattern in the room must be ensured within the variable volume flow range in question. One example of uncomplicated system configuration, which in theory has properties that fulfil the demands, was tested both in the laboratory and studied in plants in function, with focus on the indoor climate and the need of energy. Furthermore the influence of a variable <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> on duct heat gains was analysed and mathematically evaluated. The results indicate that it is clearly possible to obtain a well functioning system with a technical solution in accordance with the studied one. The indoor climate demands are essentially fulfilled. The noise levels in rooms can be kept at a well acceptable level. The draught appeared to be considerably low despite low supply air temperatures. The field monitoring of energy consumption showed that the tested VAV systems worked energy efficiently. The heat recovery system managed to cover all the heating need of the supply air, i. e. any additional heating with the heating coil was not needed even at low outdoor temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} in biomass technology {{has got a}} lot of attention due to the increase in fuel prices and issues like global warming. Producer gas as a alternative fuel, produced from biomass gasification process can be used to generate power and electricity. However, in air blown gasification, the producer gas produced has Low Calorific Value (LCV) about 4 - 6 MJ Nm - 3 with CO 2 content around 10 - 20 % by volume. To increase the LCV, the used of calcium oxide, CaO as sorbent to absorb CO 2 in the producer gas can make biomass technology more viable. In the present study, the aim is to study the fluidization of the bed in terms of the bed expansion and the pressure drop of the 1000 μm CaO-sand mixtures at different percentages, the <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> rate and pressurize air intake in the cold model experiment. The behaviors of 1000 μm CaO-sand mixtures have been conducted in a Small Bubbling Fluidized Bed (SBFB). The results show that the decrease of the CaO percentages from 70, 60, 50 to 40, will increase the pressure drop (ΔP) in the SBFB under constant pressure of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 bars.

Measurements during the commissioning phase in Spain (public library) and in Germany (production hall) {{showed that the}} dehumidification efficiency of the sorption rotors was 80 % and the humidification efficiency of the contact evaporators was 85 - 86 %. Only in a two-stage desiccant system monitored in China (laboratory building), a dehumidification efficiency of 88 % was reached. The rotary heat exchangers only had 62 - 68 % measured heat recovery efficiency, which is lower than specified. Seasonal performance monitoring {{carried out in the}} German installation showed that average seasonal COP's were close to 1. 0, when related to all operation hours. COP's increase if low regeneration temperatures are used with low dehumidification rates, which is often sufficient for moderate German climatic conditions, but much less so in the humid Chinese climate. Electrical COP's for the German system including air distribution were between 1. 7 and 4. 6 and reach values of 7. 4, when only additional pressure drops of the desiccant unit are considered. It could be shown that conventional control strategies lead to high auxiliary energy consumption, for example if fixed heating setpoint temperatures are used. Furthermore the solar air collector energy yield was very low in the German system, as regeneration was only used when all other options such as humidification at high <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> <b>flows</b> did not reduce the room air temperature enough. The studies showed that the measured auxiliary energy consumption could be reduced to near zero, if regeneration temperature setpoints were not fixed to constant values.

Due to the challenge from depletion of fossil energy sources as well as global warming, {{it is essential for}} the manufacturers to improve the heat pump efficiency in order to satisfy the requirement of living standard without consuming excessive electricity. This diploma work focuses on studying different air-to-air heat pump COP (Coeffi-cient of Performance) field testing methods and standards. Practical measurements with three test methods were carried out in parallel in the laboratory, namely SP Method, Climacheck Method and Calorimeter Method. Results were collected from both long and short term testing with the corresponding outdoor weather conditions. Hence, heat pump performance characteristics can be studied. Furthermore, uncer-tainty evaluation and limitation analysis of each testing method were made so that further improvement could be suggested for field measurement. While defrosting is a key factor to ensure high efficiency, the dynamic performance within that period is extremely hard to monitor, and it is critical for the long term HSPF (Heating Seasonal Performance Factor) measurement of air-to-air heat pumps. In this study it has been discovered that neither the SP Method nor the Climacheck Method is optimal for the field test, due to the inaccuracy during the defrosting proc-ess. The Calorimeter Method is feasible to serve as the reference method but it is not suitable for field testing. Results achieved by the SP Method seem to be in accord with what is achieved by the Calorimeter Method. However, the influence of the <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> measurement devices upon the testing unit itself, and the bulky equip-ment setup, make the SP Method infeasible for field testing during long time periods. The Climacheck Method is designed as a convenient way to carry out continuous measurement, with a user friendly interface and less bulky instrument. But it does not work properly if, for instance, the superheat is too low to avoid liquid droplets in the suction line to the compressor. Droplets result in an overestimated isentropic effi-ciency and consequently the heating capacity is also overestimated. On the other hand, the Climacheck unit warns the user and indicates the cause of the problem. Based on this study, further improvements could be suggested for each testing method. For the Climacheck method, an additional testing point is available and should be mounted close to the inlet of the condenser. For the SP Method, pre-testing in the lab could be made concerning <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> rate under different indoor fan speeds, so that the bulky air collecting system would be avoided for field testing af-terwards. Nevertheless, how to measure <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> rate accurately, especially under dynamic conditions, remains a challenge for the external COP testing method...|$|E

This work seeks the experimental evidence in sliding-vane compressors by measuring the <b>air</b> standard <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> rate and the electrical power input of three diverse configurations. The first configuration, taken as reference, employs a conventional injection system comprising calibrated straight orifices.

The laser imagining technique shows that the nozzles generate sprays that break-up within a short distance into spherical droplets, ligaments, ramifications and undefined structures. Tests on the packaged compressors reveal that the advanced configurations provide almost the same air flow rate while utilizing half of the oil because the sprays generate a good sealing. Moreover, the sprayed oil is acting as a thermal ballast because the electrical input is reduced by 3. 0 % and 3. 5 %, respectively, if the pump is not or is present, while the specific energy requirement, accounting for the slightly reduced air flow, by 2. 4 % and 2. 9 %, respectively...|$|R
