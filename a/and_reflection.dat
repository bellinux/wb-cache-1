5|$|Dactyl shares many {{characteristics}} with Ida. Their albedos <b>and</b> <b>reflection</b> spectra {{are very}} similar. The small differences {{indicate that the}} space weathering process is less active on Dactyl. Its small size would make the formation of significant amounts of regolith impossible. This contrasts with Ida, which is covered by a deep layer of regolith.|$|E
5|$|The five {{processes}} formed what Aristotle {{called the}} soul: {{it was not}} something extra, but the system consisting exactly of these mechanisms. The Aristotelian soul died with the animal and was thus purely biological. Different types of organism possessed different types of soul. Plants had a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth. Animals had both a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation. Humans, uniquely, had a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought <b>and</b> <b>reflection.</b>|$|E
5|$|The inverse {{square root}} of a {{floating}} point number {{is used in}} calculating a normalized vector. Programs can use normalized vectors to determine angles of incidence <b>and</b> <b>reflection.</b> 3D graphics programs must perform millions of these calculations every second to simulate lighting. When the code {{was developed in the}} early 1990s, most floating-point processing power lagged behind the speed of integer processing. This was troublesome for 3D graphics programs before the advent of specialized hardware to handle transform and lighting.|$|E

5|$|The {{planetary}} nebula NGC 5315 has a magnitude of 9.8 around a central star of magnitude 14.2, located 5.2degrees west-southwest of Alpha Circini. It is only visible as a disc at magnifications over 200-fold. Bernes 145 {{is a dark}} <b>and</b> <b>reflection</b> nebula first listed in the 1971 Bernes Catalog. The dark nebula component is easily visible in a large amateur telescope, and it measures 12by5arcminutes. The smaller reflection nebula component requires a larger instrument and averted vision to be seen.|$|E
5|$|After {{suffering}} from a prolonged respiratory infection, Mandela died on 5 December 2013 {{at the age of}} 95, at around 20:50 local time (UTC+2) at his home in Houghton, surrounded by his family. Zuma publicly announced his death on television, proclaiming ten days of national mourning, a memorial service held at Johannesburg's FNB Stadium on 10 December 2013, and 8 December as a national day of prayer <b>and</b> <b>reflection.</b> Mandela's body lay in state from 11 to 13 December at the Union Buildings in Pretoria and a state funeral was held on 15 December in Qunu. Approximately 90 representatives of foreign states travelled to South Africa to attend memorial events. The media was awash with tributes and reminiscences, while images of and tributes to Mandela proliferated across social media. His $4.1 million estate was left to his widow, other family members, staff, and educational institutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{elements of the}} castle were also positioned for particular effect. Unusually, the huge Great Gatehouse faced south-east, away from the main road, hiding its extraordinary architectural features. This may have been because Thomas intended {{to establish a new}} settlement in front of it, but the gatehouse was also probably intended to be viewed from the harbour, where the most senior visitors were expected to arrive. The Lilburn Tower was positioned so as to be clearly - and provocatively - visible to Edward II's castle at Bamburgh, 9 miles (15km) away along the coast, and would have been elegantly framed by the entranceway to the Great Gatehouse for any visitors. It was also positioned on a set of natural basalt pillars, which - although inconvenient to build upon - would have enhanced its dramatic appearance <b>and</b> <b>reflection</b> in the meres.|$|E

5|$|This is a {{dissection}} puzzle {{similar to}} a Tangram, and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the Archimedes Palimpsest. Archimedes calculates {{the areas of the}} 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a square. Research published by Dr. Reviel Netz of Stanford University in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square. Dr. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17,152 ways. The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation <b>and</b> <b>reflection</b> have been excluded. The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in combinatorics.|$|E
5|$|Visual {{effects were}} {{supervised}} by Tim Webber at the London-based VFX company Framestore, which {{was responsible for}} creating most of the film's visual effectsexcept for 17 shots. Framestore was also heavily involved in the art direction and, along with The Third Floor, the previsualization. Tim Webber stated that 80 percent of the movie consisted of CGcompared to James Cameron's Avatar (2009), which was 60 percent CG. To simulate the authenticity <b>and</b> <b>reflection</b> of unfiltered light in space, a manually controlled lighting system consisting of 1.8 million individually controlled LED lights was built. The 3D imagery was designed and supervised by Chris Parks. The majority of the 3D was created by stereo rendering the CG at Framestore. The remaining footage was converted into 3D in post-productionprincipally at Prime Focus, London, with additional conversion work by Framestore. Prime Focus's supervisor was Richard Baker.|$|E
