5000|$|In {{underwater}} acoustics, {{speed of}} sound depends on pressure (hence depth), temperature, and salinity of seawater, thus leading to vertical speed gradients {{similar to those that}} exist in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acoustics.</b> However, when there is a zero sound speed gradient, values of sound speed have the same [...] "isospeed" [...] in all parts of a given water column (there is no change in sound speed with depth). The same effect happens in an isothermal atmosphere with the ideal gas assumption.|$|E
5000|$|... z0 varies greatly among media, {{especially}} between gas and condensed phases. Water is 800 times denser than air and {{its speed}} of sound is 4.3 {{times as fast as}} that of air. So the specific acoustic impedance of water is 3,500 times higher than that of air. This means that a sound in water with a given pressure amplitude is 3,500 times less intense than one in air with the same pressure. This is because the air, with its lower z0, moves with a much greater velocity and displacement amplitude than does water. Reciprocally, if a sound in water and another in air have the same intensity, then the pressure is much smaller in air. These variations lead to important differences between room acoustics or <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acoustics</b> on the one hand, and underwater acoustics on the other.|$|E

Atmospheric parameter profiles (temperature, wind speed, humidity, and turbulence) and water surface roughness can dramatically affect the acoustic propagation. Wiener [1] measured acoustic transmission loss in foggy conditions using a fog horn as the acoustic source. Salomons [2] showed that water surface waves can strongly affect transmission loss in long-range, over-water propagation, while Boué [3] showed that cylindrical spreading is an appropriate model up to 700 m range. Bolin and Boué [4] showed that accurate predictions in shadow zones rely on inclusion of atmospheric turbulence in transmission loss models. In the two experiments presented here, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acoustic</b> transmission loss over water was measured as a function of range.

30|$|The use {{of active}} {{reciprocal}} transmissions for ocean remote sensing applications {{is limited by}} capital and operational costs associated with low-frequency acoustic sources as well as concerns about potential impacts of transmissions on marine life. Wave interferometry [12] and, in particular, underwater acoustic noise interferometry [13]-[17] offers a means to perform passive remote sensing by replacing probing signals generated by a dedicated source with two-point cross-correlations of diffuse ambient noise. Theory [18],[19] predicts that the cross-correlation function of diffuse noise measured at two locations in a generic inhomogeneous moving medium results in approximations to Green’s functions describing sound propagation in opposite directions between the two measurement points; positive and negative lags correspond to propagation in opposite directions [18]-[20]. Thus, two-point correlation functions allow one to quantify flow-induced acoustic nonreciprocity. Recently, passive measurements of acoustic nonreciprocity and wind velocity were experimentally demonstrated in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acoustics</b> using interferometry of traffic noise [20].|$|E

The amplitude {{spectrum of the}} Rayleigh waves shows two distinct peaks at periods of about 230 and 270 s.

30|$|Special {{cases of}} the {{procedure}} that we have described to retrieve clock drift and travel time nonreciprocity from ambient noise cross-correlations have been previously employed in seismology [22]-[24], {{where there was no}} nonreciprocity, and in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acoustics</b> [20], where there was no clock drift. To test our method of estimating time shifts, we applied it to the ambient noise recorded between synchronization pulses in the laboratory experiment on clock stability. The relative drifts of clocks measured by matching the leading fronts of the synchronization pulses and from cross-correlations of ambient noise were found to agree within 0.1 % (Figures  3 a, b). Our relative clock drift estimates based on Figure  4 c are of the same magnitude as the clock drifts measured (i) in September-October 2013 using pre-deployment and post-recovery clock synchronization pulses, and (ii) in the May 2014 laboratory experiment. The reported values of the relative clock drifts, including our estimates based on Figure  4 c, are consistent with the clock drifts being nearly constant over time periods of the order of a few weeks and slowly varying over periods of the order of a few months.|$|E
40|$|Propagation {{of sound}} waves in air can be {{considered}} as a special case of fluid dynamics. Consequently, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for fluid flow can be used for simulating sound propagation. In this article application of the LBM to sound propagation is illustrated for various cases: free-field propagation, propagation over porous and non-porous ground, propagation over a noise barrier, and propagation in an atmosphere with wind. LBM results are compared with solutions of the equations of acoustics. It is found that the LBM works well for sound waves, but dissipation of sound waves with the LBM is generally much larger than real dissipation of sound waves in air. To circumvent this problem it is proposed here to use the LBM for assessing the excess sound level, i. e. the difference between the sound level and the free-field sound level. The effect of dissipation on the excess sound level is much smaller than the effect on the sound level, so the LBM can be used to estimate the excess sound level for a non-dissipative atmosphere, which is a useful quantity in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acoustics.</b> To reduce dissipation in an LBM simulation two approaches are considered: i) reduction of the kinematic viscosity and ii) reduction of the lattice spacing...|$|E
30|$|The {{acoustic}} resonance {{between the}} ground {{surface and the}} lower thermosphere has been studied for a few decades (e.g., Jones and Georges, 1976; Tahira, 1995). The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acoustic</b> waves that are generated by lithospheric and tropospheric phenomena propagate vertically. Some of these waves reflect downward in the lower thermosphere, and interfere with the upward propagating waves. This interference makes the modal resonance between the ground surface and the lower thermosphere at frequencies of 3 – 5 mHz (Tahira, 1995). Some part of the resonant wave leaks upward and generates ionospheric variations at these resonant frequencies (Shinagawa et al., 2007).|$|R
40|$|Recently {{some groups}} {{reported}} Earth’s background free oscillations even on seismically quiet days. Statistical features {{of them and}} annual variations of their amplitudes suggest that atmospheric disturbance is the most prob-able excitation source for this phenomenon. If the atmospheric excitation mechanism is effective, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acoustic</b> free oscillations must be also excited persistently. In fact {{there is evidence of}} acoustic resonance between seismic free oscillations and the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acoustic</b> free oscillations at around 3. 7 and 4. 4 mHz but there is no direct observation of them. In at-tempt to detect the long period acoustic waves, we installed a cross array of barometers in a 10 km–wide University Forest in Central Honshu from 2002 to 2004. The array has 28 micro–barometers employing quartz crys-tal resonator technology with station spacing of about 500 m. We analyzed 1 -second continuous sampling records in a time period. Acoustic waves traveled from around northwest direction from 0. 01 to 0. 1 Hz with phase velocity of about 400 m/s at 0. 1 Hz and about 800 m/s at 0. 01. These waves are often associated with mountain region. Our array size is still not large enough to detect the expected acoustic free oscillations at around 3. 7 and 4. 4 mHz. For the detection, we have developed more precision barometers and network data collection system for expansion of the array. Now we have started test observation at 8 stations. ...|$|R

40|$|In <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acoustics,</b> {{the subject}} of surface waves has been an area of {{discussion}} for many years. The existence of an acoustic surface wave is now well established theoretically. The mathematical solution for spherical wave propagation above an impedance boundary includes {{the possibility of a}} contribution that possesses all the standard properties for a surface wave. Surface waves exist when the surface is sufficiently porous, relative to its acoustical resistance, that it can influence the airborne particle velocity near the surface and reduce the phase velocity of sound waves in air at the surface. This traps some of the sound energy in the air to remain near the surface as it propagates. Above porous grounds, the existence of surface waves has eluded direct experimental confirmation (pulse experiments have failed to show a separate arrival expected from the reduced phase speed) and indirect evidence for its existence has appeared contradictory. The experimental evidence for the existence of an acoustical surface wave above porous boundaries is reviewed. Recent measurements including pulse experiments are also described. A few years ago the acoustic impedance of a grass-covered surface was measured in the frequency range 30 to 300 Hz. Here, further measurements on the same site are discussed. These measurements include core samples, a shallow refractive survey to determine the seismic velocities, and measurements of the acoustic-to-seismic coupling coefficient...|$|E

The film merges three distinct languages, that of dystopic cinematic, the personal, poetic narrative, and an innovative use of voice to create <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acoustics.</b> Structurally, Popehelm maps a journey from a vast, empty, landscape to the intimate details of unused objects in abandoned interiors, accompanied by the monologues of three women that chart a more personal journey from loss to obsession. Ultimately, while Popehelm holds no definitive narrative, the texts, soundscape, and filming are shaped together to suggest not only an aftermath of unexplained calamity, but also the post-traumatic repetition of narrative that exist around such events. The music and sound design was drawn from vocal recording and structured via multiple enclosures. The vocal recordings derived from people of differing ages, ethnicity and gender.

40|$|Fiber-based interferometers {{provide the}} means to sense very small {{displacements}} over long baselines, and {{have the advantage of}} being nearly completely passive in their operation, making them particularly well suited for geophysical applications. This work presents the development and results from four new systems: one in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acoustics</b> and three in Earth strain. Turbulent pressure fluctuations (wind noise) are a significant limiting factor in low-frequency atmospheric acoustic measurements. The Optical Fiber Infrasound Sensor (OFIS) provides an alternative to traditional infrasonic wind noise reduction (WNR) techniques by providing an instantaneous average over a large spatial extent. This study shows that linear OFISs ranging in length from 30 to 270 m provide a WNR of up to 30 dB in winds up to 5 m/s, in good agreement with a new analytical model. Arrays of optical fiber strainmeters were deployed to measure sediment compaction at two sites in Bangladesh. One array at Jamalganj (in the north) consists of 20, 40, 60, and 100 m long strainmeters, while the second near Khulna (in the south) also includes lengths of 80 and 300 m. Two years of weekly measurements show a clear seasonal signal and subsidence at both sites that is in reasonable agreement with collocated GPS receivers. A new 250 -meter, interferometric vertical borehole strainmeter has been developed based completely on passive optical components. Details of the prototyping, design, and deployment at the Piñon Flat Observatory (PFO) are presented. Power spectra show an intertidal noise level of - 130 dB (re. 1 [epslion] /Hz), consistent within 1 - 3 dB between redundant components. Examination of its response to Earth tides and earthquakes relative to the areal strain recorded by an orthogonal pair of collocated, 730 m horizontal laser strainmeters yield a Poisson's ratio of 0. 26. Two prototype horizontal strainmeters were also developed to explore the use of similar interferometric optical fiber technology for near-surface, long baseline strain measurement. Both instruments are shown to faithfully record earthquakes and yield very good estimates of the M 2 tidal constituent, despite unexplained 2 - 8 % amplitude discrepancies between the 90 and 180 m long instruments relative to the collocated laser strainmeter and each othe...|$|E

40|$|We develop {{theoretical}} {{basics of}} active experiments with two beams of acoustic waves, radiated by a ground-based sound generator. These beams are transformed into <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acoustic</b> gravity waves (AGWs), which have parameters that {{enable them to}} penetrate to the altitudes of the ionospheric E and F regions where they influence the electron concentration of the ionosphere. Acoustic waves are generated by the ground-based parametric sound generator (PSG) at the two close frequencies. The main idea of the experiment is to design the output parameters of the PSG to build a cascade scheme of nonlinear wave frequency downshift transformations to provide the necessary conditions for their vertical propagation and to enable penetration to ionospheric altitudes. The PSG generates sound waves (SWs) with frequencies f 1 [*]=[*] 600 and f 2 [*]=[*] 625  Hz and large amplitudes (100 – 420  m s − 1). Each of these waves is modulated with the frequency of 0. 016  Hz. The novelty of the proposed analytical–numerical model is due to simultaneous accounting for nonlinearity, diffraction, losses, and dispersion and inclusion of the two-stage transformation (1)  of the initial acoustic waves to the acoustic wave with the difference frequency Δ f [*]=[*] f 2 [*]−[*] f 1 in the altitude ranges 0 – 0. 1  km, in the strongly nonlinear regime, and (2)  of the acoustic wave with the difference frequency to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acoustic</b> gravity waves with the modulational frequency in the altitude ranges 0. 1 – 20  km, which then reach the altitudes of the ionospheric E and F regions, in a practically linear regime.
