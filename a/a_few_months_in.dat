Treatt also was the Challis law lecturer at the University of Sydney. Treatt entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 26 March 1938, representing the Electoral district of Woollahra for the United Australia Party (UAP).

5|$|As oil {{production}} increased through {{the success of}} wells like the Frazier, Twin, Pool, Grant, and the two Homestead Wells, transportation of the oil {{to the outside world}} was still reliant on teamsters. The teamsters were notorious for mistreatment of their horses, most of which lost their hair due to a buildup of oil and only had a lifespan of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>in</b> Pithole. The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage, with more having to be brought in by rail from Ohio and New York. Teamsters often refused to work on days when the roads were impassable or gouged the oil producers.|$|E

5|$|Education was {{provided}} for the children, but workhouse teachers were a particular problem. Poorly paid, without any formal training, and facing large classes of unruly children {{with little or no}} interest in their lessons, few stayed in the job for more than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months.</b> <b>In</b> an effort to force workhouses to offer at least a basic level of education, legislation was passed in 1845 requiring that all pauper apprentices should be able to read and sign their own indenture papers. A training college for workhouse teachers was set up at Kneller Hall in Twickenham during the 1840s, but it closed in the following decade.|$|E
5|$|Einstein was {{now without}} a {{permanent}} home, unsure {{where he would}} live and work, and equally worried {{about the fate of}} countless other scientists still in Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months.</b> <b>In</b> late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside London, with photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein, published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.|$|E

He set up his own educational consultancy that specialised in working with NEETs, in partnership with Brooklands College.|$|E

Fisher was elected deputy leader of the Labor Party in 1905, and replaced Watson as leader in 1907. At the time, Labor supported the Protectionist Party minority government of Alfred Deakin. Deakin resigned as prime minister in November 1908 after Labor withdrew their support, and Fisher subsequently formed a minority government of his own. It lasted only a few months, as in June 1909 Deakin returned as prime minister {{at the head of the}} new Commonwealth Liberal Party (a merger of the Protectionists and the Anti-Socialist Party).|$|E
5|$|Schindler's {{ties with}} the Abwehr and his {{connections}} in the Wehrmacht and its Armaments Inspectorate enabled him to obtain contracts to produce enamel cookware for the military. These connections also later helped him protect his Jewish workers from deportation and death. As time went on, Schindler had to give Nazi officials ever larger bribes and gifts of luxury items obtainable only on the black market, to keep his workers safe. Bankier, a key black market connection, obtained goods for bribes as well as extra materials {{for use in the}} factory. Schindler himself enjoyed a lavish lifestyle and pursued extramarital relationships with his secretary, Viktoria Klonowska, and Eva Kisch Scheuer, a merchant specialising in enamelware from DEF. Emilie Schindler visited for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>in</b> 1940 and moved to Kraków to live with Oskar in 1941.|$|E
5|$|The private ferry {{struggled}} {{to operate at}} a profit, leading Kitsap Transit to consider a new ballot measure to fund a public passenger-only ferry service. A 0.3 percent sales tax {{was placed on the}} February 6, 2007, ballot, and was rejected by 54.5 percent of voters. As a result, Kitsap Transit pulled its funding for the private Kitsap Ferry Company, and the company suspended service on March 30, 2007. Another private operator, Aqua Express, had already ceased operations of a passenger-only service from Kingston to Seattle after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>in</b> 2005 due to poor ridership and increasing fuel costs.|$|E

However, in March, she wrote that she had become engaged to an Italian officer.

5|$|With the {{construction}} of canals, newly reclaimed Everglades land was promoted throughout the United States. Land developers sold 20,000lots in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>in</b> 1912. Advertisements promised within eight weeks of arrival, a farmer could be making a living, although for many it took at least two months to clear the land. Some tried burning off the sawgrass or other vegetation, only {{to learn that the}} peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms. Though initially crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{replaced}} Richardson as Treasury Secretary with Benjamin H. Bristow, a {{man known}} for his honesty, who {{began a series of}} reforms in the department. Since the Civil War, whiskey distillers and corrupt treasury agents falsified figures on the amount of liquor produced, while certifying bogus returns, denying the treasury of revenue. Discovering that millions of gallons of whiskey escaped taxation, and having Grant's endorsement to act ("Let no guilty man escape"), Bristow in May 1875 struck at the Whiskey Ring. He ordered federal marshals to seize 32 installations and arrest 350 men; Bristow obtained 176 indictments that led to 110 convictions, and giving $3,150,000 to the Treasury. Bristow's investigation implicated Babcock and Missouri treasury agent John McDonald as part of the Whiskey Ring. When informed on separate occasions, Grant became defensive concerning Babcock, but concerning McDonald, the ringleader, Grant believed he had been betrayed. In 1876, a jury acquitted Babcock at a trial influenced by Grant's deposition in Babcock's favor. After the trial, Grant dismissed Babcock from the White House. Grant freed some Ring members after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>in</b> prison, including McDonald, released after serving 17 months in jail.|$|E
