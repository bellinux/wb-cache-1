60|$|No name in Britain, however, is more {{interesting}} than that of Rochester, which admirably shows us how so many other Roman names have acquired a delusively English form, or have been mistaken for memorials of the English conquest. The Roman town was known as Durobrivæ, which does {{not in the least}} resemble Rochester; and what is more, Bæda distinctly tells us that Justus, the first bishop of the West Kentish see, was consecrated 'in the city of Dorubrevi, which the English call Hrofæs ceaster, from one of its former masters, by name Hrof.' If this were all we knew about it, we should be told that Bæda clearly described the town as being called Hrof's Chester, from an English conqueror Hrof, and that to contradict this clear statement of an early writer was presumptuous or absurd. Fortunately, however, we have the clearest possible proof that Hrof never existed, and that he was a pure creation of Bæda's own simple etymological guesswork. King Alfred clearly knew better, for he omitted this wild derivation from his English translation. The valuable fragment of a map of Roman Britain preserved for us in the mediæval transcript known as the Peutinger Tables, sets down Rochester as Rotibis. Hence it is pretty certain that it must have had two alternative names, of which the other was Durobrivæ. Rotibis would easily pass (on the regular analogies) into Rotifi ceaster, and that again into Hrofi ceaster and Rochester; just as Rhutupiæ or Ritupæ passed into Rituf burh, and so finally into Richborough. Moreover, in a charter of King Ethelberht of Kent, older a good deal than Bæda's time, we find the town described under the mixed form of Hrofi-brevi. After such a certain instance of philological blundering as this, I for one am not inclined to place great faith in such statements as that made by the English Chronicle about Chichester, which it attributes to the mythical South Saxon king Cissa. Whatever Cissanceaster may mean, it seems to me much more likely that it represents another case of double naming; for though the Roman town was commonly known as Regnum, that is clearly a mere <b>administrative</b> <b>form,</b> derived from the tribal name of the Regni. Considering that the same veracious Chronicle derives Portsmouth, the Roman Portus, from an imaginary Teutonic invader, Port, and commits itself to other wild statements of the same sort, I don't think we need greatly hesitate about rejecting its authority in these earlier and conjectural portions.|$|E

The SR in SR-22 stands for Safety Responsibility, and it is needed to reinstate a suspended driver's license after a DUI conviction in 49 states and the District of Columbia. It is submitted to the State's DMV by an auto insurance company to serve as proof that a driver has the minimum liability insurance that the states requires. They are essentially an agreement between a driver's insurance company and the respective State's DMV that requires the driver's insurance company to notify the respective State's DMV that the driver's insurance has either been terminated or lapsed; thus instituting a suspension of the driver's driving privileges until proof of insurance is re-filed with the State's DMV.|$|E
5000|$|In 839 or 840, Raffadali was {{occupied}} by the Arabs, who introduced new crops, such as apricots, pears, pistacchio, citrus fruits, and carob, {{as well as new}} farming techniques and a system of canals to irrigate the fields. One etymology for the town's name derives it from the Arabic Rahl-Afdal (رحال افدال), meaning [...] "excellent village". Two centuries later, the Norman Conquest put an end to Arab rule. Raffadali became part of the territory of the Diocese of Agrigento, which contained 54 comunes, required to pay an annual tithe to the church. In this period, Raffadali was incorporated into a territorial and <b>administrative</b> <b>form</b> typical of feudalism. On 7 October 1095, King Roger I granted the territory of Raffadali to Giorlando Montaperto, son of Giovanni Matteo and Ulla Cassaneto, as a reward for having captured the nearby castle at Monte Guastanella from an Arabic garrison led by one Ali. He thus become lord of the castle and of the raffa, that is, the surrounding territory. A popular etymology for the name of the Raffadali attributes it to the combination of Raffa and Ali. The town is first recorded in the registers of the diocese of Agrigento in 1117, where it is listed as [...] "Cattà" [...] (the name [...] "Raafala" [...] is also found in the records). In the 14th century, the village had its own parish church dedicated to St. Leonard, which is now in ruins.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to explore climatic environmental risks in the context of the growing global impact, by characterizing the <b>administrative</b> <b>form</b> of risk management, which is the most appropriate for Latvia’s insurance sector. Fundamental environmental risks are subdivided into natural risks, such as earthquakes, storms and floods; public exposure risks, such as nuclear power, climate change (pollution: air, water, earth) and economic crisis risks. Impact of particular risks is inherent in one risk-specific unit (object) or in a small number of risk-specific units (objects). Particular risks are subdivided into natural risks, such as wind, hail, drought and downpour, and third-party effect risks. Global experience demonstrates the use of new forms of insurance, by insuring fundamental environmental risks, such as captive insurance companies, financial services futures and insurance schemes. The <b>administrative</b> <b>form</b> of combined insurance – the insurance scheme – is the optimum choice for management of fundamental and particular environmental risks from both theoretical and practical point of view in Latvia’s insurance sector.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{geographically}} decentralised governance structures exists across countries (Ter-Minassian, 1997). These differences in administrative and constitutional mechanisms come about, at least partly, by historical accident and wider political factors. However, {{in this paper we}} focus on the more narrowly defined efficiency implications of such arrangements. This is useful for identifying the motives that might underlie particular administrative set ups and the possible efficiency losses associated with specific forms of decentralisation or devolution. In particular, we develop a framework that allows a comparison of the effectiveness of implementing policy through three alternative systems. These are: a centralised; a decentralised; and a fully devolved structure. In this analysis we build on the work of Canes-Wrone et al, (2001) and Maskin and Tirole (2004) on representative democracy. The novelty is that we place this analysis {{in the context of a}} potentially decentralised or devolved regional administration.
