25|$|His work, The Canon of Medicine, {{became the}} {{standard}} of medical thinking in Europe alongside those of Hippocrates and Galen. Moral and spiritual theories also prevailed, and in the Christian environment of medieval Europe, a malaise called <b>acedia</b> (sloth or absence of caring) was identified, involving low spirits and lethargy typically linked to isolation.|$|E
25|$|Saint Augustine of Hippo {{reminded}} Romans of otium philosophandi, {{a positive}} element, {{that life was}} happiest when one had time to philosophize. Augustine points out that otium was the prerequisite for contemplation. It was because of otium that Alypius of Thagaste steered Augustine away from marriage. He said {{that they could not}} live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine described Christianae vita otium as the Christian life of leisure. Many Christian writers of the time interpreted the Roman idea of otium as the deadly sin of <b>acedia</b> (sloth). Some Christian writers formulated otium as meaning to serve God through deep thought. Christian writers encouraged biblical studies to justify otium. These same Christian writers also showed otium ruris (secluded rural leisure) as a needed step to monastic propositum. Augustine describes the monastic life as otium sanctum (sanctified leisure or approved leisure). In Augustine's time the idea of philosophy had two poles of ambitions—one to be a worthy Christian (vacation - negotium) and the other to be a worthy friend of God (devotion - otium).|$|E
2500|$|A similar phenomenon, {{though not}} under the same name, {{occurred}} during the German Sturm und Drang movement, with such works as The Sorrows of Young Werther by Goethe or in Romanticism with works such as Ode on Melancholy by John Keats or in Symbolism with works such as Isle of the Dead by Arnold Böcklin. In the 20th century, much of the counterculture of modernism was fueled by comparable alienation {{and a sense of}} purposelessness called [...] "anomie"; earlier artistic preoccupation with death has gone under the rubric of memento mori. The medieval condition of <b>acedia</b> (acedie in English) and the Romantic Weltschmerz were similar concepts, most likely to affect the intellectual.|$|E
2500|$|The {{critical}} section of Cvetkovich's book provides analysis {{into some of}} the topics brought up in “The Depression Journals.” Playing a part in Cvetkovich's memoir, spirituality and religion are also discussed in her critical essay. For Cvetkovich, <b>acedia</b> – “a form of spiritual crisis” that is understood to be an historical precursor to depression – can help provide an alternative to the medical model. Cvetkovich's critical essay also explores the relationship between depression and histories of racism and colonialism, tying “history and depression into the emotional crises that undergird race studies.” Furthermore, looking at the artistic work of Sheila Pepe and Allyson Mitchell, she views “crafting as a model for creative ways of living in a depressive culture.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Eastern church {{then saw}} the {{development}} of monasticism and the mystical contributions of Gregory of Nyssa, Evagrius Ponticus and Pseudo-Dionysius. Monasticism, also known as anchoritism (meaning [...] "to withdraw") {{was seen as an}} alternative to martyrdom, and was less about escaping the world than about fighting demons (who were thought to live in the desert) and about gaining liberation from our bodily passions in order to be open to the Word of God. Anchorites practiced continuous meditation on the scriptures as a means of climbing the ladder of perfection—a common religious image in the Mediterranean world and one found in Christianity through the story of Jacob's ladder—and sought to fend off the demon of <b>acedia</b> ("un-caring"), a boredom or apathy that prevents us from continuing on in our spiritual training. Anchorites could live in total solitude ("hermits", from the word erēmitēs, [...] "of the desert") or in loose communities ("cenobites", meaning [...] "common life").|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "sloth" [...] is a {{translation}} of the Latin term <b>acedia</b> (Middle English, accidie) and means [...] "without care". Spiritually, <b>acedia</b> first referred to an affliction attending religious persons, especially monks, wherein they became indifferent to their duties and obligations to God.

Two commentators consider the most accurate translation of <b>acedia</b> to be [...] "self-pity," [...] for it [...] "conveys both the melancholy of the condition and self-centeredness upon which it is founded." ...|$|E
5000|$|The demon of <b>acedia</b> {{holds an}} {{important}} place in early monastic demonology and proto-psychology. In the late fourth century Evagrius of Pontus, for example, characterizes it as [...] "the most troublesome of all" [...] {{of the eight}} genera of evil thoughts. As with those who followed him, Evagrius sees <b>acedia</b> as a temptation, and the great danger lies in giving in to it. Evagrius' contemporary, the Desert Father John Cassian, depicted the apathetic restlessness of <b>acedia,</b> [...] "the noonday demon", in the coenobitic monk: ...|$|E

It can lead to a state of being unable to perform one's duties in life. Its spiritual overtones make it related to but arguably distinct from depression. <b>Acedia</b> was originally noted as a problem among monks and other ascetics who maintained a solitary life.|$|E

50|$|Pope Gregory {{combined}} {{this with}} tristitia into sloth for his list. When Thomas Aquinas described <b>acedia</b> in {{his interpretation of}} the list, he described it as an uneasiness of the mind, being a progenitor for lesser sins such as restlessness and instability. Dante refined this definition further, describing <b>acedia</b> as the failure to love God with all one's heart, all one's mind and all one's soul; to him {{it was the middle}} sin, the only one characterised by an absence or insufficiency of love. Some scholars have said that the ultimate form of <b>acedia</b> was despair which leads to suicide.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Acedia</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the literary criticism of Walter Benjamin. In his study of baroque literature, The Origin of German Tragic Drama, Benjamin describes <b>acedia</b> as a moral failing, an [...] "indolence of the heart" [...] that ruins great men. Benjamin considers <b>acedia</b> to be a key feature of many baroque tragic heroes, from the minor dramatic figures of German tragedy to Shakespeare's Hamlet: [...] "The indecisiveness of the prince, in particular, is nothing other than saturnine acedia." [...] It is this slothful inability to make decisions that leads baroque tragic heroes to passively accept their fate, rather than resisting it in the heroic manner of classical tragedy.|$|E

5000|$|The Oxford Concise Dictionary of the Christian Church defines <b>acedia</b> (or accidie) as [...] "a {{state of}} restlessness and {{inability}} either {{to work or}} to pray". Some {{see it as the}} precursor to sloth—one of the seven deadly sins. In his sustained analysis of the vice in Q. 35 of the Second Part (Secunda Secundae) of his Summa Theologica, the 13th-century theologian Thomas Aquinas identifies <b>acedia</b> with [...] "the sorrow of the world" [...] (compare Weltschmerz) that [...] "worketh death" [...] and contrasts it with that sorrow [...] "according to God" [...] described by St. Paul in 2 Cor. 7:10. For Aquinas, <b>acedia</b> is [...] "sorrow about spiritual good in {{as much as it is}} a Divine good." [...] It becomes a mortal sin when reason consents to man's [...] "flight" [...] (fuga) from the Divine good, [...] "on account of the flesh utterly prevailing over the spirit." [...] <b>Acedia</b> is essentially a flight from the divine that leads to not even caring that one does not care. The ultimate expression of this is a despair that ends in suicide.|$|E
5000|$|... "Foul darkness" [...] is {{the natural}} setting of Satan: in the medieval Latin {{tradition}} of the seven deadly sins, <b>acedia</b> has generally been folded into the sin of sloth. The Benedictine Rule directed that a monk displaying the outward signs of <b>acedia</b> [...] "should be reproved a first and a second time. If he does not amend he must be subjected to the punishment of the rule so that the others may have fear.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Acedia</b> (Latin, [...] "without care") (from Greek ἀκηδία) is {{the neglect}} {{to take care}} of {{something}} that one should do. It is translated to apathetic listlessness; depression without joy. It is related to melancholy: <b>acedia</b> describes the behaviour and melancholy suggests the emotion producing it. In early Christian thought, the lack of joy was regarded as a willful refusal to enjoy the goodness of God; by contrast, apathy was considered a refusal to help others in time of need.|$|E
5000|$|Emotionally and cognitively, {{the evil}} of <b>acedia</b> finds {{expression}} in a lack of any feeling for the world, {{for the people in}} it, or for the self. <b>Acedia</b> takes form as an alienation of the sentient self first from the world and then from itself. Although the most profound versions of this condition are found in a withdrawal from all forms of participation in or care for others or oneself, a lesser but more noisome element was also noted by theologians. From tristitia, asserted Gregory the Great, [...] "there arise malice, rancour, cowardice, and despair..." [...] Chaucer, too, dealt with this attribute of <b>acedia,</b> counting the characteristics of the sin to include despair, somnolence, idleness, tardiness, negligence, indolence, and wrawnesse, the last variously translated as [...] "anger" [...] or better as [...] "peevishness". For Chaucer, humans sin consists of languishing and holding back, refusing to undertake works of goodness because, he/she tells him/her self, the circumstances surrounding the establishment of good are too grievous and too difficult to suffer. <b>Acedia</b> in Chaucers view is thus the enemy of every source and motive for work.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Acedia</b> is {{currently}} {{defined in the}} Catechism of the Catholic Church as spiritual sloth, which would be believing spiritual tasks to be too difficult.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Acedia</b> is {{indicated}} by a range of signs. These signs (or symptoms) are typically divided into two basic categories: somatic and psychological. <b>Acedia</b> frequently presents signs somatically. Such bodily symptoms range from mere sleepiness to general sickness or debility, along {{with a host of}} more specific symptoms: weakness in the knees, pain in the limbs, and fever. An anecdote attributed to the Desert Mother Amma Theodora also connects somatic pain and illness with the onset of <b>acedia.</b> A host of psychological symptoms can also signify the presence of <b>acedia,</b> which affects the mental state and behavior of the afflicted. Some commonly reported psychological signs revolve around a lack of attention to daily tasks and an overall dissatisfaction with life. The best-known of the psychological signs of <b>acedia</b> is tedium, boredom or general laziness. Author Kathleen Norris in her book <b>Acedia</b> and Me asserts that dictionary definitions such as torpor and sloth fail to do justice to this [...] "temptation"; she believes a state of restlessness, of not living in the present and seeing the future as overwhelming is more accurate a definition than straight laziness: it is especially present in monasteries, due to the cutting off of distractions, but can invade any vocation where the labor is long, the rewards slow to appear, such as scientific research, long term marriages etc. Another sign is a lack of caring, of being unfeeling about things, whether that be your appearance, hygiene, your relationships, your community's welfare, the world's welfare etc.; all of this, Norris relates, is connected to the hopelessness and vague unease that arises from having too many choices, lacking true commitment, of being [...] "a slave from within". She relates this to forgetfulness about [...] "the one thing needful": remembrance of God. Anthony Robbins, the well known life coach, also believes a lack of commitment to spiritual growth will lead to negative states of mind.|$|E
