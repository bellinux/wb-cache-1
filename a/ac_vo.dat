40|$|Abstract—Enhanced {{distributed}} channel access (EDCA) is {{the basis}} protocol in IEEE 802. 11 e protocol suite. It is used for providing differentiated quality of service (QoS) in IEEE 802. 11 e standard wireless local area networks (WLANs). One of the main drawbacks in EDCA protocol is the values used for minimum and maximum contention window (CW) sizes for the <b>AC</b> <b>VO</b> access category, the queue designated for voice transmission. The <b>AC</b> <b>VO</b> queues of the QSTAs are very aggressive in transmitting their packets on to the channel due to their small CW sizes. This leads to degradation in the actual voice throughput performance even when the network size is small. In this paper, we propose a new modification to the collision avoidance mechanism used by <b>AC</b> <b>VO</b> queues without seriously effecting the performance of other traffic categories such as video and data. Extensive simulations are carried out to verify the performance of our proposed enhancement to the original collision avoidance mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{physiological}} responses and adaptations experienced by novices engaging in cross-country cycling have received little {{attention in the}} scientific literature. Such endeavors typically involve a sizeable increase in physical activity for most individuals, but the acute and chronic effects of such an endurance feat are not well understood. Similarly, research shows that experienced cyclists often demonstrate osteoporosis in the spine, linked to many years of training accompanied by little or no weight bearing stress upon the axial skeleton. Greater understanding of these issues is needed, as long distance cycling has increased in popularity in recent years, and exercise professionals increasingly supervise their training. This study explored the effects of 60 days of cycling upon measures of aerobic capacity (AC), bone mineral density (BMD) and body mass composition (BMC) of novice cyclists, {{as well as in}} a group of controls. Methods: Five novice cyclists (21. 0. 2  0. 71 yr, 187. 842  6. 50 cm, 82. 84  5. 42 kg) completed laboratory testing prior to and after the cross-country trek, as did controls (20. 2  1. 79 yr, 178. 31  4. 17 cm, 78. 34  7. 55 kg). Members of both groups visited the laboratory on two occasions, 60 days apart. Each completed a graded exercise test and DEXA scan, assessing measures of AC, BMD, and BMC. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA were used for statistical analysis. Results: For <b>AC</b> (<b>VO</b> 2 max), significant differences were found pre-post within both groups (F(1, 8) = 5. 418, p = iii 0. 048), with the cyclists improving and the controls decreasing in AC. Non-significant differences were found pre- and post-ride for the following measures of BMD: whole body (F(1, 8) = 0. 34, p = 0. 57) and lumbar region (F(1, 8) = 0. 72, p = 0. 42. Measures for whole body and lumbar region were decreased following the ride across the country. Significant differences for BMC were found between the following measures: left arm fat mass (F(1, 8) = 8. 42, p = 0. 02, left arm lean mass (F(1, 8) = 6. 16, p = 0. 04), left arm fat percentage (F(1, 8) = 38. 72, p = 0. 00), right arm lean mass (F(1, 8) = 6. 32, p = 0. 04), right arm fat percentage (F(1, 8) = 41. 78, p = 0. 00), trunk fat mass (F(1, 8) = 5. 45, p = 0. 048), right leg fat mass (F(1, 8) = 9. 04, p =. 02), and total fat mass (F(1, 8) = 13. 48, p = 0. 01). Conclusions: These results have scientific and practical relevance given the few studies on the effects of cross-country cycling upon physiological fitness in novice cyclists. These findings suggest that novice cyclists significantly increased their aerobic capacities as an adaptation to an extended ride across the United States. These results suggest nonsignificant changes in BMD occurred among these cyclists. These participants also demonstrated significant changes in some BMC measures. More study is needed on the impact of prolonged cycling upon measures of AC, BMD, and BMC among novice cyclists...|$|E
40|$|Infusion of glucose (Glu) into normal exercising dogs attenuates {{the rise}} in rectal {{temperature}} (Delta-Tre) when compared with delta-Tre during FFA infusion or no infusion. Rates of rise and delta-=Tre levels are higher during exercise after confinement. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to determine if Glu infusion would attenuate the exercise-induced excess hyperthermia after deconditioning. Rectal and quadricep femoris muscle temperatures (Tmu) were measured in 7 male, mongrel dogs dogs (19. 6 +/- SD 3. 0 kg) during 90 minutes of treadmill exercise (3. 1 +/-SD 0. 2 W/kg) with infusion (30 ml/min/kg) of 40 % Glu or 0. 9 % NaCL before BC) and after confinement (AC) in cages (40 x 110 x 80 cm) for 8 wk. Mean (+/-SE body wt. were 19. 6 +/- 1. 1 kg BC and 19. 5 +/- 1. 1 kg <b>AC,</b> exercise <b>VO</b> 2 were not different (40. 0 - 42. 0 mi/min/kg- 1). With NaCl AC, NaCl BC, GluAC, and GluBC: Delta-Tre were, 1. 8, 1. 4, 1. 3 and 0. 9 C respectively; and Delta-Tmu were 2. 3, 1. 9, 1. 6, and 1. 4 C. respectively (P< 0. 05 from GluBC). Compared with NaCl infusion, attenuated both Delta-Tre and Delta-Tmu BC and AC, respectively. Compared with GluBC, GluAC attenuated Delta-Tmu but not Delta-Tre. Thus. with similar heat production, the mechanism for attenuation at bad body temperature with Glu infusion must affect avenues of heat dissipation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe 802. 11 ac {{amendment}} of the IEEE 802. 11 standard, {{known as}} a very high-throughput {{wireless local area network}} (WLAN), has attracted extensive attention for achieving a maximum transmission rate up to 7 Gb/s. This is mainly possible by adopting the DownLink MultiUser Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (DL MU-MIMO) technology, which allows multiple frames to be simultaneously transmitted from the access point (AP) to different receivers via multiple spatial streams. To support the DL MU-MIMO technology at medium access control level, a technique called transmission opportunity (TXOP) sharing has been proposed to extend the mandatory TXOP of the WLAN standard. In this letter, we propose an analytical model based on Markov chains to evaluate the performance of an IEEE 802. 11 ac AP enabling the TXOP sharing mechanism. Based on this model, we are able to derive the achievable throughput of a given access category (<b>AC),</b> namely, voice (<b>VO),</b> video (VI), best effort (BE), and background (BK). The ultimate goal of this letter is to analyze how the TXOP sharing mechanism could improve the utilization of the scarce wireless bandwidth while achieving channel access fairness among the different ACs. Note that the obtained theoretical results are also validated by computer simulatio...|$|R
40|$|Vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) of Enterococcus hirae is {{composed}} of a soluble functional domain V 1 (A 3 B 3 DF) and an integral membrane domain <b>Vo</b> (<b>ac),</b> where V 1 and Vo domains are connected by a central stalk, composed of D-, F-, and d-subunits; and two peripheral stalks (E- and G-subunits). We identified 120 interacting residues of A 3 B 3 heterohexamer with D-subunit in DF heterodimer in the crystal structures of A 3 B 3 and A 3 B 3 DF. In our previous study, we reported 10 mutants of E. hirae V 1 -ATPase, which showed lower binding affinities of DF with A 3 B 3 complex leading to higher initial specific ATPase activities compared to the wild-type. In this study, we identified a mutation of A-subunit (LV 476 - 7 AA) at its C-terminal domain resulting in the A 3 B 3 complex with higher binding affinities for wild-type or mutant DF heterodimers and lower initial ATPase activities compared to the wild-type A 3 B 3 complex, consistent with our previous proposal of reciprocal relationship between the ATPase activity and the protein-protein binding affinity of DF axis to the A 3 B 3 catalytic domain of E. hirae V-ATPase. These observations suggest that the binding of DF axis at the contact region of A 3 B 3 rotary ring is relevant to its rotation activity...|$|R
