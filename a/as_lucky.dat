25|$|Lucky Spencer is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the ABC Daytime soap opera, General Hospital. He {{is the son}} of legendary supercouple, Luke and Laura Spencer, played by Anthony Geary and Genie Francis. His birth having been announced on-screen in 1985, a ten-year-old Lucky was cast in 1993, played by newcomer at the time, Jonathan Jackson. Jackson left the series in 1999, and the character was played by Jacob Young and later Greg Vaughan, who was let go in 2009 to allow Jackson to reprise the role. Lucky's characterization changed throughout the different portrayers; originally a street-smart con artist, Lucky develops an edge during Young's tenure and more drastically changes during Vaughan's portrayal, <b>as</b> <b>Lucky</b> becomes a struggling police officer. With Jackson's reprisal, Lucky begins showing some of the character's original quick-witted qualities, but after a series of harrowing storylines, Jackson left the series in December 2011 and the role was not recast. Jackson briefly reprised the role in July 2015.|$|E
