MacGraw got her start as a model, and her inexperience as an actress was evident on the set as she struggled with the role. According to Foster, the actress and Peckinpah got along well, but she was not happy with her performance: [...] "After we had completed The Getaway <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at what I had done in it, I hated my own performance.

I guess I was a bit lonely and I wanted to talk to someone so I opened up my computer and I just talked." [...] Additionally, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side.

500|$|While {{writing the}} pilot, Rodat {{dedicated}} a five-page montage to the alien invasion, but {{decided not to}} go through with it as it had been done before in films such as War of the Worlds. [...] "I wrote a few drafts of it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at and say, 'Ay-yay-yay, I’ve seen this before. There’s no emotion to this. It feels like one of those montages,'" [...] he said. Rodat {{came up with the idea}} of having the children in the series [...] "harnessed by aliens". [...] "When we were working out the initial stuff, the thing that excited [...] was the idea that adults are killed if they’re a threat, and kids are captured for whatever reason and changed or altered.

500|$|The {{deciding}} Game 7 of the 2015 Finals {{was scheduled}} to be played at 7:00 PM on April 30, 2015 at the WFCU Centre in Windsor, Ontario. The Express shootaround was set to take place before that of the Rainmen. The road team was supposed to arrive for warm-ups at approximately 1:00 PM, but entered the stadium approximately two hours earlier. Express assistant coach Gerry Brumpton recounted, [...] "They snuck in here before they even had the light on. We were here in the dark, I opened up the curtain <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> in and there they were. They were still here working out. So they had been here for a while." [...] The Express told their opponents to leave the arena, but they refused, with one Rainmen player dunking a basketball instead. Windsor's Bill Jones then attempted to take a ball from Halifax center Liam McMorrow, but the player [...] "flinched," [...] pretending to throw a punch. According to Rainmen player Forrest Fisher, Jones tackled McMorrow to the ground and Express guard Tony Bennett followed up by hitting McMorrow with a chair. Referring to the Rainmen, Jones said, [...] "A couple of them kicked me and tried to take swings at me. And my players were there and they came to my rescue {{to be able to get}} me up." [...] Soon the violence escalated, with staff members and players from both teams involved. At around 10:40 AM, Windsor police received a phone call [...] "that between 15 to 20 men were involved in an altercation."

[...] The music begins and Kesha makes eyes at James Van Der Beek. After the eye contact Kesha grabs one of the unicorns and kisses him then removes her bra and throws it across the room, Van Der Beek then does the same with his bra, puzzling Kesha as to why he was wearing a bra.

If it isn’t James Van Der Douche.", [...] "I don't appreciate you slander-Beeking my name, Ke dollar sign ha.") before engaging in a gun fight. They begin shooting lasers at one another, killing multiple unicorns. Van Der Beek gets hit in the shoulder and falls. Kesha steps on his arm to stop him from reaching for his gun, as he begs for mercy, which Kesha denies. At the end of the video, it is revealed that Kesha killed Van Der Beek and that she has mounted his head on her wall with the plaque reading, [...] "James Van Der Dead", as she sits with two unicorns laughing. She then frowns at the camera and it switches to Van Der Beek one more time before the screen goes black.|$|E

[...] "Of course Harmony <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at some of Riff Raff's videos as inspiration, but he was one of a number of people we looked at.
