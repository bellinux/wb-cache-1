50|$|Cataplexy is {{considered}} secondary {{when it is}} due to specific lesions in the brain that cause a depletion of the hypocretin neurotransmitter. Secondary cataplexy is associated with specific lesions located primarily in the lateral and posterior hypothalamus. Cataplexy due to brainstem lesions is uncommon particularly when seen in isolation. The lesions include tumors of the brain or brainstem and <b>arterio-venous</b> malformations. Some of the tumors include astrocytoma, glioblastoma, glioma, and subependynoma. These lesions can be visualized with brain imaging, however in their early stages they can be missed. Other conditions in which cataplexy can be seen include ischemic events, multiple sclerosis, head injury, paraneoplastic syndromes, and infections such as encephalitis. Cataplexy may also occur transiently or permanently due to lesions of the hypothalamus that were caused by surgery, especially in difficult tumor resections. These lesions or generalized processes disrupt the hypocretin neurons and their pathways. The neurological process behind the lesion impairs pathways controlling the normal inhibition of muscle tone drop, consequently resulting in muscle atonia.|$|E
5000|$|Schaper {{summarizes}} the status-2009 knowledge of coronary collateral transformation {{in a recent}} review: [...] "Following an arterial occlusion outward remodeling of pre-existent inter-connecting arterioles occurs by proliferation of vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells. This is initiated by deformation of the endothelial cells through increased pulsatile fluid shear stress (FSS) caused by the steep pressure gradient between the high pre-occlusive and the very low post-occlusive pressure regions that are interconnected by collateral vessels. Shear stress leads to the activation and expression of all nitric oxide synthetase (NOS) isoforms and nitric oxide production, followed by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, which induces monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) synthesis in the endothelium and in the smooth muscle of the media. This leads to attraction and activation of monocytes and T-cells into the adventitial space (peripheral collateral vessels) or attachment of these cells to the endothelium (coronary collaterals). Mononuclear cells produce proteases and growth factors to digest the extra-cellular scaffold and allow motility and provide space for the new cells. They also produce NO from inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), which is essential for arteriogenesis. The bulk of new tissue production is carried by the smooth muscles of the media, which transform their phenotype from a contractile into a synthetic and proliferative one. Important roles are played by actin binding proteins like actin-binding Rho-activating protein (ABRA), cofilin, and thymosin beta 4 which determine actin polymerization and maturation. Integrins and connexins are markedly up-regulated. A key role in this concerted action, {{which leads to a}} 2-to-20 fold increase in vascular diameter, depending on species size (mouse versus human), are the transcription factors AP-1, egr-1, carp, ets, by the Rho pathway and by the mitogen activated kinases ERK-1 and -2. In spite of the enormous increase in tissue mass (up to 50-fold), the degree of functional restoration of blood flow capacity is incomplete and ends at 30% of maximal coronary conductance and 40% in the vascular periphery. The process of arteriogenesis can be drastically stimulated by increases in FSS (<b>arterio-venous</b> fistulas) and can be completely blocked by inhibition of NO production, by pharmacological blockade of VEGF-A, and by the inhibition of the Rho-pathway. Pharmacological stimulation of arteriogenesis, important for the treatment of arterial occlusive diseases, seems feasible with NO donors." ...|$|E

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to appraise whether an increased amniotic fluid pressure by polyhydramnios can beneficially affect monochorionic twins that are haemodynamically connected by <b>arterio-venous</b> plus arterio-arterial placental anastomoses. We assessed the effects of polyhydramnios in monochorionic twin placentas, combining (a) data from previous in vitro placental perfusion experiments in singleton term placentas under simulated normal and increased amniotic fluid pressures with (b) logical deduction from observations made in monochorionic twins. Our hypothesis is that in monochorionic placentas, an increased amniotic fluid pressure increases the placental microvascular resistance but not the resistance of placental chorionic plate arteries. Hence, an increased amniotic fluid pressure increases the microvascular resistance of the joint cotyledon, the <b>arterio-venous</b> resistance, but not the arterioarterial resistance. This proposed mechanism reduces <b>arterio-venous</b> but not oppositely directed arterio-arterial transfusion. Therefore, reversal of the normal direction of net foeto-foetal transfusion may develop, which will reduce the circulatory imbalance that evolved between the monochorionic foetal twins. In contrast, in monochorionic twins connected by unidirectional or bidirectional <b>arterio-venous</b> anastomoses reversal of the normal direction of net foeto-foetal transfusion will not occur. In conclusion, reversal of the normal direction of net foeto-foetal transfusion, induced by polyhydramnios, is protective against the onset and severity of twin-twin transfusion syndrome in monochorionic twins connected by <b>arterio-venous</b> plus arterio-arterial anastomoses, but not by unidirectional or bidirectional <b>arterio-venous</b> anastomose...|$|E
30|$|In a young patient {{affected}} by choriocarcinoma and metrorrhagia, a computed tomography showed a giant <b>arterio-venous</b> fistula, pulmonary metastases and embolism.

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare retinal <b>arterio-venous</b> {{circulation}} time by fluorescein (FA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) in birdshot chorioretinopathy. METHODS: We analyzed prolonged retinal <b>arterio-venous</b> fluorescein transit time, a known feature in birdshot chorioretinopathy and correlated it with ICGA findings in four consecutive patients. RESULTS: Mean retinal <b>arterio-venous</b> fluorescein {{circulation time}} was 31. 1 +/- 5. 2 seconds, a transit time significantly longer {{than in a}} group of ten patients with sarcoidosis (9. 45 +/- 3. 36 sec., p < 0. 0001) and {{in a group of}} three cases with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (7. 0 +/- 1. 1 sec., p < 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Prolonged fluorescein <b>arterio-venous</b> transit time seems to be a characteristic feature of birdshot chorioretinopathy that does however not reflect the actual intravascular hemodynamic situation but diffuse blood-retinal barrier damage allowing exudation, slow gradual tissue impregnation and delayed venous reabsorption of small molecules like fluorescein...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{evaluate}} the vascular malformations of the head and neck. They are uncommon lesions, but some areas have a significant potential for fatality, due to their massive bleeding. The vascular anatomy of the nose carries a high recurrence rate, due to the unique characteristic of the nose, especially if deep vascular connection is present. METHODS: The present article describes 2 patients of nasal dorsum arteriovenous malformations, both using a combined procedure: preoperative selective embolization, en-bloc tumor resection, and reconstruction with a forehead flap. Two female patients with <b>arterio-venous</b> malformations of the nose were examined, subjected to excision procedure and forehead flap reconstruction. Current treatment requires surgical resection of the nose and in conjunction with adjunctive endovascular embolization; it reduces <b>arterio-venous</b> malformations recurrence. RESULTS: The authors report an endovascular and surgical technique to treat nasal <b>arterio-venous</b> malformations, which permits a complete resection and a reconstruction with a forehead flap. There were no major complications such as recurrent ulceration, infection, postoperative bleeding, or flap failure. All the patients responded positively and satisfactory results were achieved in both female patients. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce the recurrence of <b>arterio-venous</b> malformations, the multidisciplinary therapy is mandatory. Recent advances in microsurgery and interventional radiology have greatly improved prognosis for patients with <b>arterio-venous</b> malformations. Therefore, a preoperative selective embolization followed by surgical excision seems to be a good compromise for <b>arterio-venous</b> malformations therapy. The forehead flap, for its characteristics, represents the better choice for nasal reconstruction...|$|E

40|$|By {{means of}} {{catheterization}} of hepatic veins, hepatic oxygen consumption was estimated on {{patients with chronic}} viral hepatitis (37 cases), precirrhosis (4 cases) and cirrhosis of the liver (13 cases). The oxygen consumption was calculated from the difference of oxygen content between the hepatic artery and the hepatic vein multiplied with the total hepatic blood flow. The results werc as follows: 1. The oxygen content of the arterial blood showed {{no significant difference in}} groups of chronic hepatitis, precirrhosis and cirrhosis of the liver. 2. Similarly, the <b>arterio-venous</b> oxygen difference, as measured without any regard of hepatic shunt flow, did not differ significantly in those three groups. Decreased hepatic blood flow, therefore induced a decreased amount of hepatic oxygen consumption; the decrease of hepatic blood flow was not accompanied with the compensatory increase of the plausible <b>arterio-venous</b> oxygen difference. 3. The <b>arterio-venous</b> oxygen difference calculated with a reference to the influences of hepatic shunt flow was estimated by multiplication of <b>arterio-venous</b> oxygen difference to the ratio of total hepatic blood flow and effective hepatic blood flow. The difference was found to be increased in a majority of the cases of liver cirrhosis, indicating the oxygen extraction by the hepatic cells in cirrhosis was significantly increased. Conversely, oxygen saturation of non-shunted hepatic venous blood was markedly decreased in cirrhosis. Thus the increased oxygen extraction by the cirrhotic hepatic cells occured in the state of low oxygen tension. The hepatic oxygen consumption was found to be maintained as great as possible by increasing the <b>arterio-venous</b> oxygen difference calculated with a reference to the influence of hepatic shunt flow. 4. The increase of the <b>arterio-venous</b> oxygen difference calculated with a reference to the influence of hepatic shunt flow was closely related to the abnormalities of the hepatic hemodynamics, histological changes and hepatic disfunctions...|$|E
