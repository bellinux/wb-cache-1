The Lehigh Valley International Airport remained opened, but most flights were canceled. There was no public transportation on the 17th.|$|E

Many of these are citizens of Ado urban, some are citizens of Ado rural, some are stranger elements, <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are even Europeans and other expatriates. The citizenry warmly welcomed these development. For example, when the main road from the National Bank junction, through Erekesan and Ereguru to Ojumose was tarred in 1952 and the major road from Ajilosun through Ijigbo, Orereowu, Okesa and Obada etc. a section of Akure - Ilorin road, was tarred in 1956, the very welcome development was rendered in popular juju songs, one of which rang: ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{there is}} some {{evidence}} of mathematical work in Kerala prior to Madhava (e.g., Sadratnamala c. 1300, a set of fragmentary results), it is clear from citations that Madhava provided the creative impulse {{for the development of a}} rich mathematical tradition in medieval Kerala. [...] However, most of Madhava's original work (except <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>them)</b> is lost. [...] He is referred to in the work of subsequent Kerala mathematicians, particularly in Nilakantha Somayaji's Tantrasangraha (c. 1500), as the source for several infinite series expansions, including sinθ and arctanθ. [...] The 16th-century text Mahajyānayana prakāra (Method of Computing Great Sines) cites Madhava as the source for several series derivations for π. [...] In Jyeṣṭhadeva's Yuktibhāṣā (c. 1530), written in Malayalam, these series are presented with proofs in terms of the Taylor series expansions for polynomials like 1/(1+x2), with x = tanθ, etc.|$|E
2500|$|Hansen {{intended}} {{to record the}} album in late 2001, but due to the September 11 attacks, [...] "it {{took a while for}} people to line up." [...] Before working with Godrich, Beck recorded tracks with Dan [...] "The Automator" [...] Nakamura in January 2002 in preparation for the new record, but no songs from those sessions were used for Sea Change. Many songs, such as [...] "Lost Cause", were performed live prior to the album's recording. Another new song, [...] "Evil Things", was also performed and demoed but ultimately not recorded for the album, due to loss of time. Regarding the performances of more personal tracks in the days before Sea Change, Beck explained in a 2008 interview that [...] "Those were the kinds of songs I would play {{in the middle of the}} show. I'd try to throw <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> in. I just remember the audience kind of disregarding them, or moshing, or throwing things. Just because those were the kinds of persons that came out." ...|$|E

[...] In 1997 he popped his head out into the public and began becoming more active on IRC and many smaller hacking forums. [...] He saw some people who he thought were insanely brilliant individuals who seemed to have the same mindset and positive attitude towards hacking that he did so he decided to approach <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> to see if anyone would be interested in forming a group and working together. [...] There was always a huge emphasis not only on technical competence and variety, but also on strength of character and integrity. [...] The team was a mix of hackers, programmers, phone phreakers, security professionals, and artists. [...] They had experience in multiple programming languages and operating systems.

2500|$|Meles Zenawi's {{administration}} {{was the first}} to introduce private press in Ethiopia. However, he has been under fire often for imprisonment of journalists and lately for some website censorship. The Meles government defends its action on the ground that the banned media outlets advocated [...] "a certain population should be quarantined" [...] and incited [...] "violence among different ethnic groups in the country," [...] including using hate-filled text messages on mobile phones asking people to attack ethnic groups. Some sources blame certain websites and papers who have been caught inciting violence and asking for bombings on companies. <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> have even been sued for provoking uprising. Others claim that the supporters of the previous dictatorship government are trying to use the new opportunity to freely express themselves by defaming the current government officials. But the government critics say that the ruling party is not willing to be criticised. Many reports of international organizations support their claim. Strong criticism came from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). In its 2007 press freedom summary it wrote, [...] "Ethiopia [...] the world's worst backslider on press freedom over the previous five years". At the start of 2010, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that an Ethiopian journalist has been jailed for a year for criticising Meles.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, Lyle Jeffs' {{estranged wife}} Charlene Jeffs claimed in a custody dispute {{that the group}} {{currently}} enforces a doctrine allowing sex with women only by men of the group appointed as [...] "seed bearers", defined as [...] "elect" [...] men of a [...] "worthy blood line chosen by the Priesthood to impregnate" [...] women. Under this doctrine, men no longer are allowed to have children with their wives. Charlene Jeffs wrote in her custody petition: [...] "It is the husband's responsibility to hold {{the hands of their}} wives while the seed bearer 'spreads his seed'. In layman terms, the husband is required to sit in the room while the chosen seed bearer, or <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> rape his wife or wives." [...] She also described the [...] "Law of Sarah," [...] in which FLDS women perform sex acts on each other to prepare for a sexual encounter with a man in the FLDS leadership. Lorin Holm, who claimed to have been part of Jeffs' [...] "inner circle" [...] before he was excommunicated from the group in 2011, later described the [...] "Law of Sarah" [...] practice in Jeffs' community as akin to a lesbian sex show with Jeffs participating and sermonizing. Holm also said that mothers who would not take part were sent away to [...] "redeem themselves", and their children given to other women.|$|E

[...] He relates {{that they were}} a [...] "friendly bunch" [...] who, when Elvis began to sing just for fun during his interview, followed [...] "suit, singing, clowning, all on their feet". According to Patrick Humphries, they [...] "acted as Elvis' bodyguards, babysitters, drug procurers, girl-getters, mates and car buyers." [...] The author also mentions other functions of the guys: [...] "various members of the Memphis Mafia had ... played vital roles in keeping Elvis' numerous dirty secrets out of the public eye. <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had been arrested with false prescriptions attempting to collect drugs for Elvis, quite a few had taken physical hits in the service of protecting Elvis and none were paid more than $500 a week. For that they were often shouted at, abused and belittled by the King when he felt like it." [...] noted Buzz Cason. Marty Lacker states, [...] "Everyone had assigned responsibilities and they were far from leeches, hangers on or whatever else they were called." [...] "They all had jobs to do so that Elvis could do his and as far as being there for the money, that's laughable because there really wasn't much in that area to be there for." [...] Marty went on to say, [...] "Most of us were not there for the money, we were there because we all cared about Elvis and each other like brothers." ...|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of volcanic plumes at Pele and Loki in 1979 provided conclusive evidence that Io was geologically active. Generally, plumes form when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected skyward from Io's volcanoes at speeds reaching , creating umbrella-shaped clouds {{of gas and}} dust. Additional materials that might {{be found in the}} volcanic plumes include sodium, potassium, and chlorine. Although striking in appearance, volcanic plumes are relatively uncommon. Of the 150 or so active volcanoes observed on Io, plumes have only been observed at <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> dozen <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> The limited area of Io's lava flows suggests that much of the resurfacing needed to erase Io's cratering record must come from plume deposits.|$|R
