Add to that a migration to the state of Washington, where the child had no friends or relations; the arrival of four babies; regular—and reportedly mutual—domestic violence; and an income so unstable that there were times when the family had nothing to eat but dandelion greens, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> situation that might well have led to murder.

Orlando Sentinel writer Parry Gettelman said the dance-oriented tracks [...] "have great grooves and a warmth, humor and vocal finesse sadly lacking in the Top 40".

500|$|Critical {{response}} in the United States proved to be less favourable. In a review published in Virginia in January 1983, Edward Jones of The Free-Lance Star offered praise for the [...] "novel touch" [...] of casting a would-be-mother as the principal villain, commenting, [...] "In {{what has to be}} a new low, even for extraterrestrial-horror films, all the men end up punching this pregnant woman in the stomach. What a time to have twins!" [...] Nevertheless, Inseminoid is discarded as [...] "no more than a mix of everything-you've-ever-seen-in-a-horror-movie-and-didn't-particularly-want-to-see-again." [...] In a November 1983 edition of the Floridian newspaper Boca Raton News, Skip Sheffield branded the film [...] "horrible" [...] and [...] "cheapo", suggesting that his readers [...] "Imagine Alien without the fantastic sets, convincing special effects and literate dialogue, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> picture of Horror Planet."

500|$|In Meade's opinion, Mavis gave {{a name to}} and {{represented}} {{a certain type of}} woman: [...] "A 1940s spinster with a 1940s head who's looked 50 since birth. A Woman's Realm made flesh. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> name for her. She's a Mavis... Mavis Riley was a masterpiece of observation". His opinion was shared by Gerlinde Frey-Vor and Julia Hallam, who consider Mavis to be a [...] "model for a spinsterly type of woman". Brian Meade suggested that Barlow had [...] "honed a comic gem until it cut into the national consciousness" [...] in her characterisation of Mavis, likening her to other successful TV characters like Basil Fawlty, Del Boy Trotter and Alf Garnett. Meade applauded Barlow for staying true to Mavis's character for 26years, [...] "sustaining the most timid, world-weary of women with remarkable consistency. Try to recall her great lines and you are stumped. Every sentence she whimpered seemed to begin with 'Ooh Derek' and end with: 'Well, I don't really know, but he suggested that she had graced some of Coronation Street's [...] "finest scenes", pointing to Mavis and Rita's spoof of a Laurel and Hardy act as one example.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{who were}} {{generally}} less positive in their opinions of Tangled {{and its main}} characters Rapunzel and Flynn Rider were otherwise impressed by Pascal and Maximus' performances. The Liverpool Echos Catherine Jones felt that [...] "Pascal and Maximus shamelessly scene-steal from the human characters", while Chris Tookey of the Daily Mail wrote, [...] "The enjoyable visual gags generally come from the two animal sidekicks". The Illinois Times Chuck Koplinski wrote, [...] "Throw in two animal sidekicks – wily horse Maximus and protective chameleon Pascal – <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> film that, while not as moving as the Pixar movies, is a satisfying lark." [...] TV Guide opined that although [...] "There's nothing particularly innovative about Dan Fogelman's screenplay", the author wrote that [...] "a cute animal sidekick ... extend to the visual aspects of the film". Similarly, Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy wrote, [...] "This ride's a familiar one, but with humourous (sic) sidekicks such as horse-who-thinks-he's-a-dog Maximus and chameleon Pascal, it's thoroughly enjoyable." [...] Although Dave White of Movies.com strongly panned Tangled, he dubbed Pascal and Maximus the film's [...] "Most Memorable Cliché", writing that the characters [...] "are better than the movie deserves." [...] White continued, [...] "they both steal scene after scene from the Cream of Wheat-like main characters", concluding, [...] "I kept wishing I was watching a movie about just them." [...] The Independents Anthony Quinn, who was ambivalent towards the film, admitted that Pascal and Maximus [...] "provide some chuckles." [...] Similarly, Tom Huddleston of Time Out wrote, [...] "With two such bland heroes, it's good that plenty of {{attention is paid to}} the supporting characters, notably ... a bad tempered but loveable horse", while Todd Hertz of Christianity Today called Maximus [...] "a more complex, multi-dimensional character than some movies' leads". Despite calling the film [...] "bland", the Houston Chronicles Amy Biancolli called Maximus a [...] "stone cool" [...] character. Tyler Hanley Palo Alto Weekly, however, praised the entire ensemble as a whole, calling Rapunzel, Flynn, Pascal and Maximus [...] "a thoroughly enjoyable quartet." [...] In a lone lukewarm review, James Berardinelli of ReelViews called Pascal [...] "among the least recognizable animal sidekicks (although he possesses amusing mannerisms)." ...|$|E

It's a bit like eating and menus in restaurants: you're hungry <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sudden craving for noodles, so you go and eat noodles.

2500|$|Betza also {{proposed}} a 24×24 version of Chess on a Really Big Board, {{although he did}} not fully design it. His description of the game was [...] "Push 9 boards together in a [...] square, symmetrically replicate all the unique pieces from the Four Board Chess lineup, add a W beside the K, two Fs flanking the K [...] W, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> game." [...] The W and F are here the wazir and ferz. This description is however not unique: the diagram shown to the right is one possible interpretation, but others are also consistent with his description.

2500|$|Decisions {{about tax}} status {{have been based}} on whether an {{organization}} functions like a church. On the other hand, Establishment Clause cases turn on whether the ideas or symbols involved are inherently religious. An organization can function like a church while advocating beliefs that are not necessarily inherently religious. Author Marci Hamilton has pointed out: [...] "Moreover, the debate is not between secularists and the religious. The debate is believers and non-believers on the one side debating believers and non-believers on the other side.

2500|$|In 2011 Mariani {{reactivated}} DM3. They toured extensively overseas {{as well as}} dates throughout Australia.

The following month the group played at the 30th anniversary of Citadel Records; also at the celebration were Penny Ikinger (ex-Sacred Cowboys) and Deniz Tek (Radio Birdman) both on guitars.

[...] The Triple Threat match between Shawn Michaels, Chris Benoit, and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship has received critical acclaim with many wrestling publications and websites calling this match [...] one of the greatest wrestling matches of all time.
