In the future, the inclusion of an <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>payment</b> program into the WTO's "green box" could be more easily challenged by WTO member countries {{on the basis that}} it has more than "minimal" trade-distorting impacts on production. The goal {{of this paper is to}} conduct an ex ante analysis of the trade impacts of stylized examples of <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>payment</b> programs that have been proposed for implementation in the near future. To simulate the production and trade impacts of these programs, we use a partial equilibrium model of the U. S. agricultural sector in a sensitivity analysis across a range of design options for agri-environmental payments. For the three <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>payment</b> scenarios evaluated, the maximum change in exports ranges from a 7 percent decrease (wheat) to a 1 percent increase (soybeans). We do not expect the programs that decrease U. S. production, which would tend to have an upward pressure on world commodity prices, to be challenged before the WTO.

40|$|<b>Agri-environmental</b> <b>payments</b> {{are part}} of a re-instrumentation of farm support in some {{developed}} countries. In general, they are meant to contribute to the cost of meeting regulations, compensate for income lost by adopting certain practices, and reward farmers for providing environmental services. In this context, <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>payments</b> are seen as a vehicle which could potentially contribute to meet the double objectives of providing environmental benefits to society while supporting farm income. Such <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>payments</b> are gaining importance in the policy portfolio of certain countries in response to higher social expectations with respect to the environmental performance of the agricultural sector as well as in response to international agreements constraining the use of trade-distorting support measures. The present study sheds some light on limited international experience by assessing the contribution that payments for ecological goods and services make to farm income in Switzerland, France and the Walloon region of Belgium.

They are estimated at the object level, that is, per field or field element, so payments can be set that lead to an efficient resource allocation, structure of incentives and production. We find that, according to the criteria assessments for the Swedish agri-environmental situation, {{it is best to}} use a set of seven composite indicators on arable fields, permanent grasslands, linear elements, point elements, forest edges, bio-rich trees and relics.

40|$|Agricultural {{agencies}} have long offered agri-environmental payments that are inadequate to achieve water quality goals, and many state water quality agencies are considering point-nonpoint trading {{to achieve the}} needed pollution reductions. This analysis considers both targeted and nontargeted <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>payment</b> schemes, along with a trading program which is not spatially targeted. The degree of improved performance among these policies is found to depend on whether the programs are coordinated or not, whether double-dipping (i. e., when farmers are paid twice—once by each program—to undertake particular pollution control actions) is allowed, and whether the agri-environ-mental payments are targeted. Under coordination, efficiency gains only occur with double-dipping, so that both programs jointly influence farmers ’ marginal decisions. Without coordination, double-dipping may increase or decrease efficiency, {{depending on how the}} agri-environmental policy is targeted. Finally, double-dipping may not solely benefit farmers, but can result in a transfer of agri-cultural subsidies to point sources.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five papers that analyse {{various aspects of}} contracts in agriculture. Four papers concern collaborative arrangements between farmers. Different types of gains from partnerships are analysed, such as gains from risk-sharing and diversification, biological effects, cost savings on machinery and labour and improved farm efficiency. Also a potential cost of partnerships – the risk of opportunistic behaviour among partners – is analysed. The objective of the first paper is to analyse if there are incentives for a partnership between a specialised piglet and fattening pig producer (vertical co-ordinated integration). Using data for average Swedish pig producers, it is shown that improved production results in vertically coordinated production as well as risk reduction create incentives for specialised piglet and fattening pig producers to collaborate. The second paper analyses the incentives for collaboration between a crop and a dairy farm by applying {{a model of a}} share contract. This study uses data from two pair of case farms representing crop and dairy farms of various sizes. The results suggest that gains from risk sharing, diversification, improved crop rotation and machinery- and labour-sharing can be substantial in a partnership. Paper IV analyses farmers' decision to engage in partnership arrangements, involving machinery- and labour-sharing with other farmers. A theoretical framework is used to illustrate that any incentive to act opportunistically is deterred by presence of social norms. The empirical analysis, based on a questionnaire to Swedish farmers in combination with FADN-variables, suggests that moral hazard problems are perceived to be relatively limited in existing partnerships, which are characterized by a considerable a degree of trust and good social relations. In the last paper, the impact of machinery- and labour-sharing arrangements on farm efficiency is analysed using the same data sources as in Paper IV. The results suggest that average efficiency is greater among the partnership farms, compared with the non-partnership farms. Moreover, partnership farms with the most extensive collaboration, i. e. that share all machinery, display the highest average efficiency scores. One paper deals with farmers' participation in <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>payment</b> programs. In that study, farmers' decision to participate in <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>payment</b> programs is analysed, as well as the impact of program participation on economic performance.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} on {{the development and implementation}} of a decentralised and outcome-based <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>payment</b> scheme in a project region in central Germany. A research group from Goettingen University together with local actors designed the scheme which complies with the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy. The core of the programme is the creation of a market for ecological goods, in this case: of plant diversity standards in agriculture. Supply is provided by the local farmers, who, in an open competitive bidding, offer to produce as much as they are willing to of the commodity in question. The local population has to be seen as the beneficiary of these environmental goods. In the project, it is represented by a Regional Advisory Board which expresses the demand for plant diversity (i) by defining the goods and (ii) by allocating the funds to the respective goods. Hence, these plant diversity goods are treated as merit goods. To justify this approach, results from a contingent valuation study that focused on the respondents’ decision behaviour are applied. These results show that the utility expected from the provision of these goods is substantial and that ecological goods are considered as personally relevant. Based on these findings, the paper discusses the provision of ecological goods as merit – as opposed to private – goods. environmental services, decentralisation, contingent valuation, merit goods, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|E

40|$|A {{framework}} for analyzing conservation programs that rank applications using environmental indices is presented. We derive the optimal bid from the farmer's perspective for both land retirement and working lands <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>payment</b> programs and we analyze how these solutions depend on program design parameters. The distinction is made between environmental objectives {{based on whether}} the farmer exercises control or not over the level proposed {{in a bid to}} participate in a program. The optimization model is solved analytically for two cases - a land retirement and a working lands program - highlighting the differences in the results. For land retirement programs we conclude that, for the cases considered, the exogenous environmental performance does not affect the endogenous environmental performance offered in a bid, but it does impact the rental rate requested. For working lands payments programs we find there is no interior solution to the decision problem, which generates a dichotomy between sets of parameters that either favor bidding based on past stewardship and low payments, or favor providing bids with higher endogenous environmental performance but requesting the maximum allowable payment. A sufficient condition is derived for the latter case to apply. A simulated auction example highlights for a working lands program that changing the objective weights can have more than proportionate impacts on the endogenous environmental performance offered by farmers. This result is in strong contrast with the relative stability of the outcome of the simulated auction for the land retirement program. environmental payments, program design, participation incentives, D 8, H 5, Q 28, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|E
40|$|Our study {{set out to}} {{investigate}} if and how willingness to pay [...] both hypothetical and actual [...] might reflect individuals' wider cognitive networks. We draw {{on the idea of}} cognitive hierarchies, i. e., the notion that concrete preferences and attitudes are embedded in networks of more abstract beliefs and values, and explore if willingness to pay (WTP) as expressed through contingent valuation can be understood as part of such hierarchies. To this end, we elicited stated and actual WTP in a survey of public preferences and attitudes towards the establishment of an <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>payment</b> scheme in Northeim, Germany, that rewards farmers for the provision of riparian buffer strips. Two main findings emerged from the study. First, only a very small proportion of those stating positive WTP did actually transfer the money. Second, contrary to our hypotheses, results from a Structural Equation Model suggest that stated WTP was only poorly connected to attitudes towards the payment scheme and other potentially relevant, more abstract beliefs and values. This casts doubts on the meaningfulness of such statements. Of the ten different fundamental value types included, only universalism and conformity {{played a significant role in}} the cognitive hierarchy and informed generalised environmental beliefs as well as attitudes towards the payment scheme. As attitudes seemed to be better integrated in the cognitive network than WTP, we discuss if surveys of public preferences should rely on attitude statements rather than solely on monetary values.

40|$|We {{compare the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of two simulated auction models (AM 1, AM 2) {{with that of}} classical payment mechanisms as a marginal flat rate payment (MFR) and average flat rate payment (FR). The models follows the one-shot budget constrained auction model first introduced by Latacz-Lohmann and Van Der Hamsvoort (1997), and subsequently by Viaggi et al. (2008) and Glebe (2008). The first model (AM 1) deals with one-dimensional bids and it allows farmers to make an offer about a per hectare <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>payment</b> {{that they would like}} to receive in order to implement a generic agri-environmental measure on their agricultural land. In the second auction model (AM 2) we further extend the analysis, allowing farmers to offer a combination of payment and a measure of their uptake in the agri-environmental program (i. e. a share of their land to commit under the program). Once simulated for AM 1 and AM 2 the optimal bidding behavior of a population of farmer taken from FADN data of E-R 2010 and 2011, assuming a fixed budget level and the sole objective for the public regulator to maximizes farmers participation to the AEM, we analyzed the total payment, the total cost and the total contracted area comparing the result with MFR and FR payment. The results confirm that the auction has the potential to reduce farmers’ information rent when compared with uniform policy instruments. Though the scale of saving depends crucially on auction design hypotheses and farmers' expectation about the maximum acceptable bid cap. The simulation while reflects a number of plausible assumptions, also remains rather simplified and could be improved in further research. However, it can contribute to feed the debate at EU policy level about the role in considering auction design and bidding behaviour so as to limiting the inefficiency related to the actual agri-environmental payments. ...|$|E
40|$|Agri-environmental {{schemes and}} {{cross-compliance}} {{are the two}} main components of the Common Agricultural Policy that address environmental issues. Under regulation 1698 / 2005, agri-environmental scheme design {{has been established in}} such a way as to use cross-compliance as the baseline against which prescriptions and payments are identified. In this framework, <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>payments</b> to farmers are justified only for the component of public goods produced (if any) above the cross-compliance prescription level. This constraint has become a major determinant of the design of agri-environmental schemes in all EU Member States in which both instruments are implemented. This paper investigates farmer participation, compliance choices and socially optimal level of monitoring when cross-compliance and agri-environmental schemes are jointly considered, and when information about compliance is asymmetrically distributed between farmers and the public regulator. The results show that the two policy instruments interact with each other, with <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>payments</b> actually providing incentives for cross-compliance, when the cross-compliance monitoring and sanction system does not guarantee full compliance. However, the numerical example in Emilia-Romagna (Italy) demonstrates that with the present combination of controls and sanctions, farmers have very little incentive to be compliant with both cross compliance and agri-environmental schemes. Hence, the results highlight that the monitoring in CC or in AES does not have the same effect on the farmers’ compliance. This underscores the need for further research in this field, particularly as provision of environmental goods becomes more important in the future Common Agricultural Policy...|$|R
