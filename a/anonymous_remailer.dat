50|$|A pseudonymous remailer or nym server, {{as opposed}} to an <b>anonymous</b> <b>remailer,</b> is an Internet {{software}} program designed to allow people to write pseudonymous messages on Usenet newsgroups and send pseudonymous email.

These instructions usually involve the <b>anonymous</b> <b>remailer</b> network itself, thus protecting the true identity of the user.|$|E

A number of factors contributed to this. Fears that copyright would be eroded by the ease with which digital media could be copied led people to study ways of embedding hidden copyright marks and serial numbers in audio and video; concern that privacy would be eroded led to work on electronic cash, <b>anonymous</b> <b>remailers,</b> digital elections and techniques for making mobile computer users harder for third parties to trace; and there remain the traditional [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} whether anonymity online has a future. In {{the early days}} of the Internet, strong cryptography, <b>anonymous</b> <b>remailers,</b> and a relative lack of surveillance created an environment conducive to anonymous communication. Today, the outlook for online anonymity is poor. Several forces combine against it: ideologies that hold that anonymity is dangerous, or that identifying evil-doers is more important than ensuring a safe mechanism for unpopular speech; the profitability of identification in commerce; government surveillance; the influence of intellectual property interests and in requiring hardware and other tools that enforce identification; and the law at both national and supranational levels. As a result of these forces, online anonymity is now much more difficult than previously, and looks to become less and less possible. Nevertheless, the ability to speak truly freely remains an important 2 ̆ 7 safety valve 2 ̆ 7 technology for the oppressed, for dissidents, and for whistle-blowers. The article argues that as data collection online merges with data collection offline, the ability to speak anonymously online will only become more valuable. Technical changes will be required if online anonymity is to remain possible. Whether these changes are possible depends on whether the public comes to appreciate value the option of anonymous speech while it is still possible to engineer mechanisms to permit it...|$|R
