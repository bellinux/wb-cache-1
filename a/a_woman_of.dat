5|$|In contrast, {{two sons}} of Rædwald's brother Eni, who were both eager {{to renew their}} Christian alliances, made {{diplomatic}} marriages during this period: Anna, who {{was to become a}} devout Christian ruler, married <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>of</b> East Saxon connection and his brother Æthelric married a Northumbrian princess, Hereswitha, who was Edwin of Northumbria's grand-niece. This marriage was probably intended to reinforce the conversion of East Anglia to Christianity.|$|E

5|$|That man's a great director. He {{can make}} people feel {{perfectly}} natural. He's got what Chaplin did when he directed <b>A</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>of</b> Paris—he and Lewis Milestone and Mal St. Clair all have that same touch, they all belong to the new school of directors, it seems to me.

5|$|Although Chaplin {{still had}} plans for future film projects, by the mid-1970s {{he was very}} frail.

He also appeared in a documentary about his life, The Gentleman Tramp (1975), directed by Richard Patterson.

5|$|At one time, some dynasties adhered {{strictly}} {{to the concept}} of royal intermarriage. The Bernadottes, Habsburgs, Sicilian and Spanish Bourbons and Romanovs, among others, introduced house laws which governed dynastic marriages; it was considered important that dynasts marry social equals (i.e., other royalty), thereby ruling out even the highest-born non-royal nobles. Those dynasts who contracted undesirable marriages often did so morganatically. Generally, this is a marriage between a man of high birth and <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>of</b> lesser status (such as a daughter of a low-ranked noble family or a commoner). Usually, neither the bride nor any children of the marriage has a claim on the bridegroom's succession rights, titles, precedence, or entailed property. The children are considered legitimate for all other purposes and the prohibition against bigamy applies.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{developed}} {{a passion for}} music {{as a child and}} taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello. He considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important, and from <b>A</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>of</b> Paris onwards he took an increasing interest in this area. With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack – composed by himself – for City Lights (1931). He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films.|$|E

5|$|In 1842, {{the young}} Danish {{archaeologist}} J. J. A. Worsaae disagreed the Haraldskær Woman was Gunnhild.

5|$|Marian Cruger Coffin (September 16, 1876 – February 2, 1957) {{was one of}} {{the first}} American women to work as a {{professional}} landscape architect, and became famous for designing numerous gardens for members of the East Coast elite to whom she had connections through her mother's side of the family.

Coffin was determined to embark on a career despite the social problems that it would cause for <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>of</b> her class and enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she studied between 1901–4 as one of only four women in architecture and landscape design.|$|E
5|$|Mona Lisa {{fulfilled}} 15th- {{and early}} 16th century requirements for portraying <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>of</b> virtue. Lisa {{is portrayed as}} a faithful wife through gesture—her right hand rests over her left. Leonardo also presented Lisa as fashionable and successful, perhaps more well-off than she was. Her dark garments and black veil were Spanish-influenced high fashion; {{they are not a}} depiction of mourning for her first daughter, as some scholars have proposed. The portrait is strikingly large; its size is equal to that of commissions acquired by wealthier art patrons of the time. This extravagance has been explained as a sign of Francesco and Lisa's social aspiration.|$|E

5|$|One of the barrows (south {{of where}} the {{thatched}} barn now stands) contained a high status cremation of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>of</b> about twenty years in age, accompanied by an incense cup, a halberd-style pendant made from amber and copper alloy, and two gold cones that would have covered buttons of an organic material.

An urn from one of the barrows likely to have been made between 1700 and 1500 B.C., has been identified as Trevisker ware, a type widely found throughout Devon and Cornwall which was transported east in lesser amounts, this find being one of the easternmost discovered.|$|E
