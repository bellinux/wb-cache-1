5|$|Conrad {{seems to}} have been {{involved}} when Henry V revolted against his father in 1105. This would explain his election as Archbishop of Salzburg at the Diet of Mainz on 7 January 1106.

Some of these soldiers may well have been servitors, servile rather than free vassals. With this display of force, he was able to force Berthold to abdicate.
