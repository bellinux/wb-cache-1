40|$|This paper explores a new {{approach}} to assess <b>assemblability</b> of manual assembly. Assessment of assembly is a prerequisite to optimize an assembly process. Traditionally <b>assemblability</b> is assessed by Design for Assembly (DFA) tools and Time motion studies. However, DFA tools do not usually take into account the inuence of human postures whereas time motion studies focus typically on bench work type of jobs. In order to assess the difculty of a manual assembly process, we must take into account both the static aspects of the job (represented by difculty of maintaining a posture) as well as its dynamic aspects (difculties associated with moving from one posture to another). So, we propose a method that combines both time and postural analysis for the assessment of <b>assemblability.</b> The tool used for the static analysis is called Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA); for dynamic analysis we propose a method of time analysis that is based on a ratio of time spent in ne and gross motions carried out in an assembly process. The difculty of assembly of a series of manual assembly tasks carried out in laboratory was assessed by this method and correlating the assessment with the feedback obtained from the subjects who carried out these assembly tasks. A video recording of the assembly tasks of a desktop personal computer frame assembly was used as the case study.

Assembly planning requires <b>assemblability</b> analysis which usually employs disassembly planning. In order to recycle or repair a certain component of a used product, we need to disassemble it from the product. The automation of the disassembly operations is highly anticipated with increasing emphasis on the environmental impact of post-use products. We break down the disassembly operations into separation, traveling, alignment, and exiting stages. This model simplifies the analysis of the disassemblability of components and helps obtain collision-free disassembly paths. The disassembly paths include not only translational but also rotational motions; the latter are not well solved in the literature. The proposed three disassembly sequencing algorithms generate (1) a single sequence for the fast <b>assemblability</b> analysis, (2) multiple sequences for a whole product in the layer-by-layer fashion, and (3) goal-oriented sequences for a target component to be recycled or repaired, respectively.

This paper proposes an integrated approach to <b>assemblability</b> analysis and evaluation for STEP-based (STandard for the Exchange of Product model data, officially ISO 10303) electro-mechanical products. In the paper, two assembly representation models are first brought up and elaborated: the EXPRESS/XML schema-based model and the NIST object-oriented UML-based Open Assembly Model (OAM). These two models are then integrated together; the OAM incorporates the EXPRESS/XML schema-based assembly model to completely capture the detailed geometric information. Based on STEP, the proposed assembly evaluation approach uses the EXPRESS/XML schema-based model as the information source, and the evaluation structure covers not only the assembly parts ’ geometric and physical characteristics but also takes into account the assembly operation data necessary to assemble the parts. The feature of this approach is the linkage of the STEP product definition to the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for assembly evaluation. The proposed approach has the flexibility to be used in various assembly methods and different environments. The case study shows that the proposed approach is feasible. 1...|$|E

Visual servoing techniques have shown great promise as a control strategy capable of sub-micron precision while compensating {{for many of the}} problems that exist in the micro domain, including thermal expansion of assembly devices and imprecisely modeled and calibrated sensors and actuators. This project develops rules for micropart design to aid in device <b>assemblability</b> with visual servoing techniques by ensuring that the microparts can be easily tracked and controlled using vision feedback. A criterion is presented that estimates part trackability based on the visual appearance of the part. This criterion is then used to microfabricate features to improve part trackability and hence, the <b>assemblability</b> of the device. The criterion considers the feature appearance when the part lies out of the optical system's depth-of-field. A Fourier optics based approach is used to simulate the visual appearance of microparts represented by CAD models using high resolution optical systems. This simulation is used to automatically design microfabricated features on microparts. These features are used to estimate the tracking accuracy of the MEMS parts to subpixel levels using interpolation techniques in optical flow based tracking. This allows MEMS parts to be assembled with precisions on the order of 20 nm with high magnification lens, using visual servoing strategies.

Many proactive measures have been made trying to prevent these problems such as training production staff in load ergonomics, workstation improvements and design changes in product and production development. Nevertheless, there are remaining difficulties in receiving acceptance for product and production changes because of poor assembly ergonomics solutions.

40|$|A Digital Fabrication Production System (DFPS) is {{a concept}} {{describing}} a set of processes, tools, and resources that {{will be able to}} produce an artifact according to a design, fast, cheap, and easy, independently of location. A DFPS project is a complex assembly of custom parts that is delivered by a network of fabrication and assembly processes. This network is called the value chain. The workflow concept of a DFPS is the following: begin design process with a custom geometric form; decompose it into constructible parts; send the part files for fabrication to various locations; transport all parts at the construction site at the right time; finally, assemble the final artifact. Conceptually it means that based on a well structured value chain we could build anything we want, at anyplace, at controllable cost and quality. The goals of a DFPS are the following: custom shapes, controllable lead time, controllable quality, controllable cost, easiness of fabrication, and easiness of assembly. Simply stated this means to build any form, anywhere, accurately, cheap, fast, and easy. Unfortunately, the reality with current Digital Fabrication (DF) projects is rather disappointing: They take more time than what was planned, they get more expensive than what was expected, they involve great risk and uncertainty, and finally they are too complex to plan, understand, and manage. Moreover, most of these problems are discovered during production when it is already late for correction. However, there is currently no systematic approach to evaluate difficulty of production of DF projects in Architecture. Most of current risk assessment methods are based on experience gathered from previous similar cases. But it is the premise of mass customization that projects can be radically different. Assembly incompatibilities are currently addressed by building physical mockups. But physical mockups cause a significant loss in both time and cost. All these problems suggest that an introduction of a DFPS for mass customization in architecture needs first an integrated theory of assembly and management control. Evaluating feasibility of a DF project has two main problems: first, how to evaluate <b>assemblability</b> of the design; second, how to evaluate performance of the value chain. <b>Assemblability</b> is a system’s structure problem, while performance is a system’s dynamics problem. Structure of systems has been studied in the field of Systems Engineering by Network Analysis methods such as the Design Structure Matrix (DSM) (Steward 1981), and the liaison graph (Whitney 2004), while dynamics of systems have been studied by System Dynamics (Forrester 1961).

The study confirmed a strong relation between poor ergonomics assembly solutions and quality errors of the product (car). There was a substantially increased risk for quality errors and increased costs for corrective measures of the product for assembly items of high and moderate physical work load compared to assembly items of low work load. The quality risk was increased 3 and 3. 7 times, respectively. The overall cost for corrective measures in the assembly plant and for factory complete cars was 8. 7 and 8. 2 times higher for assembly items of high and medium physical work load compared to items of low physical work load. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate the need for ergonomics simulations of potentially harmful assembly concepts in combination with cost-benefit analyses of conceivable system solutions based on calculation of costs for quality errors related to poor ergonomics and poor <b>assemblability.</b> The intended end result of this research is a model by application of which it is possible to calculate the cost for quality losses and health effects due to poor ergonomics and compare it with the cost for improving the ergonomics with designers, manufacturing engineers and ergonomists as main users...|$|E
