The predicted structures for apo- 2 AR and butoxamine- 2 AR are stable in MD, but in epinephrine- 2 AR, extracellular water trickles into the binding pocket to mediate hydrogen bonding between the catechol of epinephrine and Ser- 204 on helix 5.

40|$|The {{androgen}} receptor (AR) signaling axis plays {{a critical role}} in the development, function and homeostasis of the prostate. The classical action of AR is to regulate gene transcriptional processes via AR nuclear translocation, binding to androgen response elements on target genes and recruitment of, or crosstalk with, transcription factors. Prostate cancer initiation and progression is also uniquely dependent on AR. Androgen deprivation therapy remains the standard of care for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.

40|$|Surface-relief, {{submicron}} period transmission gratings are fabricated in fused silica. A rigorous vector diffraction code, {{based on}} the coupled-wave analysis technique, is used to design and analyze the surface relief gratings. When light with wavelength greater than the grating period encounters such element, only zeroth order transmitted and reflected beams propagate, all other diffracted orders are evanescent. These surface-relief gratings act as homogeneous thin film layers of equivalent refractive indices. The equivalent refractive indices depend on grating characteristics, angle of incidence, and incident light polarization. These gratings {{can be used as}} equivalent anti-reflection coatings and as polarization elements. Since the grating structures are etched into the substrate material, these optical elements are durable and chemically resistant compared to resist gratings. Subwavelength elements may {{play a critical role in}} high power laser systems where damage resistant antireflection and birefringent materials may not exist. By gaining an understanding and being able to control the many variables involved in the grating fabrication process, one-dimensional and two-dimensional submicron period surface-relief resist gratings with rectangular profiles and precisely controlled dimensions are generated. Subsequent pattern transfer etch into underlying substrate layer resulted in one and two-dimensional gratings in fused silica. One-dimensional gratings fabricated in fused silica behaves as polarization elements, giving a maximum measured phase retardation of 50 degrees. To create a polarization insensitive antireflection structure, two-dimensional surface relief gratings are fabricated. These elements exhibited reflectivities near zero percent. The <b>AR</b> <b>structures</b> also showed broadband performance. Application of two-dimensional <b>AR</b> <b>structures</b> on a 16 -level diffractive phase plate reduces the surface reflectance of the multilevel phase plate to 0. 2 %, from 3. 3 % of that of a bare fused silica surface.
