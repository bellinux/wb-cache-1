NigeriaSAT- 2 is a high performance Earth Observation mission designed for a 7. 5 year lifetime to achieve 2. 5 m imagery in a panchromatic waveband along with 5 m and 32 m imagery in four mutli-spectral channels. The spacecraft will deliver high data throughput on an agile platform, whilst still maintaining high levels of pointing accuracy during downlink opportunities. All of this will be included in a 300 Kg satellite. The innovative <b>Antenna</b> <b>Pointing</b> <b>Mechanism</b> developed by Surrey Satellite Technology Limited incorporates a compact circularly polarized antenna with a narrow 3 dB beam-width of 25 degrees and bore-sight gain of 15 dBiC. It also houses the necessary drive electronics and structural elements to provide a nimble, 2 -axis antenna solution. The pointing accuracy of the unit is better than 1 degree and the maximum slew rate is better than 20 deg/s, at acceleration rates up to 4 deg/s/s. Such low-cost and compact yet agile antenna systems have not been used previously on small satellite missions and as such, the <b>Antenna</b> <b>Pointing</b> <b>Mechanism</b> is an enabling technology in the commercialization of small Earth Observation spacecraft missions. Numerous design trades were made along the development path of the <b>Antenna</b> <b>Pointing</b> <b>Mechanism</b> and these are covered in this paper.

40|$|Micro-vibrations {{on board}} {{spacecraft}} are {{an issue of}} growing importance, as some modern payloads, {{and in particular the}} new generations of optical instruments require extreme platform stability. These low level mechanical disturbances are usually created by the functioning of mechanical equipment (sources) such as reaction wheels, <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> cryo-coolers etc., and cover a wide frequency range. Because of the low level of the vibrations and their wide frequency range, the modeling and analysis of micro-vibrations poses a challenge as the typical structural modeling techniques used in this sector (Finite Element Method (FEM) and Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA)) are reliable only in some areas of the frequency spectrum. The FEM is well suited for low level frequencies; whereas energy methods (e. g. SEA or Energy Finite Element Method EFEA) are suited for high-frequency problems; in the mid-frequency range, finally, other methods (e. g. Hybrid FEA-SEA) tend to be used, even if they’re still not well-established such as the ones named before. However the issue {{is that there is no}} single method that can address micro-vibrations in the whole frequency range. In this paper, the methods cited above will be very briefly reviewed and their use in specific micro-vibration prediction problems will be investigated in detail and compared with experimental results. In practice the work presented here uses the Finite Element Method as base-line method to investigate the whole frequency range (say up to 1000 Hz). The FEM predictions are then compared with the experimental results, showing that at medium and high frequencies the response start to deviate significantly from the FEA predictions. The high frequency behavior of the structure will be analyzed using SEA. The mid-frequency range, finally, will be tackled from both directions: from the high frequency side using the Hybrid FE-SEA, whereas from the low frequency side the capability of the standard FEM will be extended using stochastic FEM. The tests are carried out using the structural qualification model of an SSTL satellite bus that has been used to support a high resolution camera. The computational transfer functions and those from the experimental activity will be finally compared using the Modal Assurance Criteria (MAC) ...|$|R
40|$|Lubrication is {{critical}} {{in order to achieve}} high efficiency and reliability of machine elements such as gears, bearings, and other moving mechanical assemblies (MMA). In space applications, tribological properties of lubricants are quickly growing more important. Traditional space systems such as satellites imply MMA such as gyroscopes, <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and solar array drives. These MMA operate in high vacuum (< 10 - 5 Pa) under lightly loaded conditions. Modern space missions on the other hand, such as remotely operated vehicles used for in-situ Mars exploration relies on different types of MMA. In these robotic systems, electromechanical actuators are being used extensively to provide controlled motion. Gears and bearings in these actuators operate in an atmosphere mainly consisting of CO 2 at ~ 10 + 3 Pa under heavily loaded contact conditions. In these conditions, the tribosystem is likely to operate in the boundary lubricated regime, with consequent risk of high friction and wear. High molecular weight fluids have significant heritage in space because of their low vapor pressure. They are currently employed as lubricants {{in a wide range of}} space applications, as they meet high demands on resistance to vacuum outgassing. Unfortunately, the large molecules are susceptible to degradation under heavy load. Ionic liquids (ILs) on the other hand, are synthetic fluids that consist entirely of ion pairs with opposing charge. The resulting ion bonds enable inherently low vapor pressure of the fluid without the need for a high molecular weight. For this reason ILs have been advocated as potential lubricants for space applications, but so far compatibility issues have hampered their use as lubricants. Countless IL variations are possible, and solutions are thus likely to exist. Constituent ions can be designed individually and combined in various configurations. However, the fundamental understanding of the lubricating mechanism of ionic liquids is still incomplete, and consequently the optimum molecular structure for IL lubricants remain unknown. In this thesis, a stepwise approach to molecular design of IL lubricants is described, and the resulting hydrocarbon-mimicking ionic liquids are evaluated in tribological experiments. In this thesis, the experiments focus on tribological performance, using steel-steel tribopairs in air environment under boundary lubrication (Paper I). Boundary film formation under a range of contact pressures and temperatures, is analyzed after tribotesting by optical profilometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X- iii ray spectroscopy (EDS) in Paper II. The analysis reveal formation of a highly effective boundary film based on silicate, that can be further enhanced by amine additives. This thesis demonstrates the feasibility of improving tribological performance of ionic liquids by molecular design. Projekt: Rymdforskarskolan 201...|$|R

With the comparison of different load configurations, the load structure is designed reasonably with certain size parameters. This structure design solves the inertia coupling problem of two axes. To fit the given frequency, repeatedly iterative design is done. In this process, the size parameters are modified which affect the frequency until it reaches the given frequency. The load structure is optimized further to ensure the adjustment of the inertia within a certain range and maintain a substantially constant frequency.

40|$|On ITALSAT Flight 2, the Italian {{telecommunications}} satellite, the two L-Ka antennas (Tx and Rx) use {{two large}} deployable reflectors (2000 -mm diameter), whose deployment and fine pointing functions are accomplished {{by means of}} an innovative mechanism concept. The Antenna Deployment & Pointing Mechanism and Supporting Structure (ADPMSS) is based on a new configuration solution, where the reflector and mechanisms are conceived as an integrated, self-contained assembly. This approach is different from the traditional configuration solution. Typically, a rigid arm is used to deploy and then support the reflector in the operating position, and an <b>Antenna</b> <b>Pointing</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (APM) is normally interposed between the reflector and the arm for steering operation. The main characteristics of the ADPMSS are: combined implementation of deployment, pointing, and reflector support; optimum integration of active components and interface matching with the satellite platform; structural link distribution to avoid hyperstatic connections; very light weight and; high performance in terms of deployment torque margin and pointing range/accuracy.

An air bearing gravity unloading facility for two-orthogonal-axis <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>mechanism</b> (APM) is designed {{based on this}} method. This method is proposed based on the characteristics analysis of the two-orthogonal-axis APM and air bearings. The mechanism of the hierarchical and simultaneous gravity unloading method is described in detail. It solves the coupling problem of two axes and unloads the gravity of both joints hierarchically and simultaneously. The air bearing gravity unloading facility which is a structure mechanism with two layers based on this method is designed with planar air bearing and air spindle. The structure of the facility is described in detail. The dynamic models of the APM with its load in space environment and on the air bearing gravity unloading facility are derived respectively. With the analysing of the driving torques and vertical forces of the APM joints in both models, the results demonstrate that the gravity unloading facility can simulate the microgravity environment successfully. This conclusion is also proved by the dynamic simulation with ADAMS software. The simulation also provides some optimization targets for the gravity unloading facility.

30|$|Joint {{clearances}} in antenna pointing mechanisms lead to {{uncertainty in}} function deviation. Current studies mainly focus on radial clearance of revolute joints, while axial clearance {{has rarely been}} taken into consideration. In fact, owning to errors from machining and assembly, thermal deformation and so forth, practically, axial clearance is inevitable in the joint. In this study, an error equivalent model (EEM) of revolute joints is proposed with considering both radial and axial clearances. Compared to the planar model of revolute joints only considering radial clearance, the journal motion inside the bearing is more abundant and matches the reality better in the EEM. The model is also extended for analyzing the error distribution of a spatial dual-axis (“X–Y” type) <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of Spot-beam antennas which especially demand a high pointing accuracy. Three case studies are performed which illustrates the internal relation between radial clearance and axial clearance. It is found that when the axial clearance is big enough, the physical journal can freely realize both translational motion and rotational motion. While if the axial clearance is limited, {{the motion of the}} physical journal will be restricted. Analysis results indicate that the consideration of both radial and axial clearances in the revolute joint describes the journal motion inside the bearing more precise. To further validate the proposed model, a model of the EEM is designed and fabricated. Some suggestions on the design of revolute joints are also provided.|$|E

40|$|<b>Antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> {{calibration}} {{is a major}} {{task for}} ensuring a correctly aligned SAR antenna radiation pattern. This combines both the accurate control and measurement of {{the attitude of the}} satellite as well as the electronic adjustment of the SAR antenna. For upcoming SAR missions, which use a reflector antenna design like ESA's BIOMASS or DLR's Tandem-L, the <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> may no longer be fixed to the attitude of the satellite bus. Due to small deformations of the reflector or the boom, the <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> may vary (i) over orbit, (ii) over season and (iii) due to aging. In such a case, novel approaches are required to ensure a continuous monitoring of the correct <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> over non-homogeneous distributed targets. For the commissioning phases of Sentinel- 1 A & B, the procedure of determining the <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> was divided into two parts: (i) azimuth <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> and (ii) elevation <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing.</b> Both cases rely on different measurement approaches. <b>Antenna</b> azimuth <b>pointing</b> determination has been based on ground receiver measurements of azimuth notch transmit patterns while antenna elevation was based on rainforest measurements of elevation notch patterns. For the innovative TOPS mode ("Terrain Observation by Progressive azimuth Scans") of Sentinel- 1, where the azimuth beams are steered from aft to fore, antenna patterns are compressed due to this steering. For this TOPS mode of Sentinel- 1, practically each pulse is commanded with a different azimuth beam, using a very fine granularity in azimuth steering, with a total of around 800 steered azimuth beams per burst and with up to 5 subswaths. A precise prediction of this compressed azimuth pattern from the antenna model takes into account (i) the accurate knowledge of the imaging geometry (ii) the antenna excitation coefficients, and (iii) a precise knowledge of the right sequence of steered azimuth beams and scanned elevation beams together with the correct timing synchronization of the data. In principle, referencing modeled and measured TOPS patterns at one mainlobe, the mismatch of the position of the other mainlobes can be used for achieving a pointing characterization over the whole range of swaths covered by this TOPS datatake. In this presentation, we first discuss the pointing accuracy achieved both in azimuth and elevation during the S 1 B commissioning phase. We then investigate the usability of measured TOPS azimuth-patterns to facilitate the determination of the variation of the azimuth mispointing over elevation. Finally, we present a new approach using a combination of notch and regular beams which has been developed and tested using the aperture switching capability of the TerraSAR-X satellite.
