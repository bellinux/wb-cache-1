5|$|In {{the years}} {{preceding}} the crisis, three Icelandic banks, Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir, multiplied in size. This expansion {{was driven by}} ready <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>credit</b> in international financial markets, in particular short-term financing. As the international financial crisis unfolded in 2007–2008, investors perceived the Icelandic banks to be increasingly risky. Trust in the banks gradually faded, leading to a sharp depreciation of the Icelandic króna in 2008 and increased difficulties for the banks in rolling over their short-term debt. At {{the end of the}} second quarter of 2008, Iceland's external debt was 9.553 trillion Icelandic krónur (€50 billion), more than 7 times the GDP of Iceland in 2007. The assets of the three banks totaled 14.437 trillion krónur at {{the end of the second}} quarter 2008, equal to more than 11 times the national GDP. Due to the huge size of the Icelandic financial system in comparison with the Icelandic economy, the Central Bank of Iceland found itself unable to act as a lender of last resort during the crisis, further aggravating the mistrust in the banking system.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the relationship between commercial bank lending terms, financial literacy and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> formal <b>credit</b> by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Design/methodology/approach – In this cross-sectional study, the authors surveyed 384 business owners or managers of SMEs in Uganda. The authors applied confirmatory factor analysis to reduce the number of factors and identify the important elements that capture commercial lending terms, financial literacy and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> formal <b>credit.</b> The authors put forward and tested two hypotheses relating to the significance of the relationship between perceived commercial bank lending terms, financial literacy and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> formal <b>credit</b> using structural equation modelling with analysis of moment structures 18. Findings – The results suggest a positive and significant relationship between perceived commercial bank lending terms, financial literacy and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> formal <b>credit.</b> Moreover, the ANOVA results serendipitously show that <b>access</b> <b>to</b> formal <b>credit</b> varies with type of business and turnover. However, collateral and loan repayment periods are not observed variables for commercial bank lending terms. The most significant observed variable for commercial bank lending terms is interest rates. This, together with financial literacy, explains 31 per cent of the variances in <b>access</b> <b>to</b> formal <b>credit</b> by SMEs in Uganda. Research limitations/implications – The study is limited to the SME firms registered and operating in Kampala, Uganda and it is possible that the results are only applicable to these firms in Uganda. Nevertheless, the findings have implications to commercial banks wishing to improve the turnover of their micro-lending schemes. Practical implications – Efforts by the stakeholders to improve financial literacy of SMEs owners and managers must be matched with favourable interest rates if <b>access</b> <b>to</b> formal <b>credit</b> is <b>to</b> be enhanced. Social implications – The findings also have implications for governments aiming at improving <b>access</b> <b>to</b> finance to overcome income inequality problems, and also improve their growth. Originality/value – The results provide initial evidence of the aggregate explanatory power of interest rates and financial literacy for the criterion variable, <b>access</b> <b>to</b> formal <b>credit</b> by SMEs.

40|$|While it is {{commonly}} believed that lack of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> government-subsidized “formal” <b>credit</b> underlies observed differences in farm productivity in rural India, there is little empirical evidence on this issue. In this paper I address this issue by examining whether households use the farm land rental market <b>to</b> equilibrate their <b>access</b> <b>to</b> formal <b>credit,</b> as they are known {{to do in the}} case of other imperfectly marketable inputs. This research reveals, however, that the advantage formal borrowers enjoy in the tenancy market does not reflect their <b>access</b> <b>to</b> formal <b>credit</b> per se, but their greater ownership of inputs such as irrigated land.

There is less consensus on whether expanding <b>access</b> <b>to</b> consumer <b>credit</b> helps borrowers, particularly when loans are extended at high interest rates. Popular skepticism about "unproductive," "usurious" lending is fueled by research highlighting behavioral biases that may induce overborrowing. We estimate the impacts of expanding <b>access</b> <b>to</b> consumer <b>credit</b> at a 200 % annual percentage rate (APR) using a field experiment and follow-up data collection. The randomly assigned marginal loans produced significant net benefits for borrowers across {{a wide range of}} outcomes. There is also some evidence that the loans were profitable. The Author 2009.

40|$|This study {{specifically}} {{investigated the}} factors that influenced access by the poor and Blacks <b>to</b> <b>credit</b> in the segmented financial sector in South Africa, using income and expenditure survey data from 1995 and 2000. The study sheds light {{on the extent of}} financial sector deepening through household participation especially among the poor and Blacks, {{in the context of the}} fight against poverty. In this study, three types of credit were identified. Formal <b>credit</b> was defined <b>to</b> include debts from commercial banks (including mortgage finance and car loans), semi-formal credit included consumption credit (for household assets such as furniture and open accounts in retail stores), and informal <b>credit</b> specifically referred <b>to</b> debts from relatives and friends. Multinomial logit models and Heckman probit models with sample selection were used for analytical work. The results suggest that the poor and Blacks have limited <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the formal and semi-formal financial sectors. At the national level, <b>access</b> <b>to</b> bank <b>credit</b> is positively and significantly influenced by age, being male, household size, education level, household per capita expenditure and race (being Coloured, Indian or White). Being poor has a negative and significant effect on formal credit access. Semi-formal credit access is positively and significantly influenced by household size, per capita expenditure, provincial location (Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, Free State and North West) and being Coloured. The negative and significant factors in determining <b>access</b> <b>to</b> semi-formal <b>credit</b> include being male, rural location, being poor and being White. Informal credit access is negatively and significantly influenced by education level and race (being Coloured or White). Among the poor, <b>access</b> <b>to</b> bank <b>credit</b> is positively and significantly influenced by being male, provincial location (Western Cape, Gauteng and Mpumalanga) and being Coloured. <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> semi-formal <b>credit</b> is positively and significantly determined by household per capita expenditure, provincial location (Western Cape, Northern Cape, North West and Gauteng) and being Indian. <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> informal <b>credit</b> by the poor is positively and significantly influenced by provincial location (Kwazulu Natal and Gauteng). Within the black population, <b>access</b> <b>to</b> bank <b>credit</b> is positively and significantly influenced by age, being male, household per capita expenditure and education level. Semi-formal credit access by Blacks is positively and significantly influenced by household size, household per capita expenditure, education level and provincial location (Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, Free State and North West). However being male, poor and located in a rural area negatively affected <b>access</b> <b>to</b> semi-formal <b>credit</b> by Blacks. Informal credit access by Blacks is negatively influenced by education level, but positively influenced by being located in the Western and Eastern Cape. These findings confirm that improving <b>access</b> <b>to</b> organized <b>credit</b> markets (i. e formal and semi-formal credit markets) by the poor and Blacks, remains important in the fight against poverty. credit, poverty, South Africa...|$|R

25|$|The loss of {{political}} influence {{contributed to the}} difficulties of African Americans {{in their attempts to}} obtain extended credit in the late 19th century. Together with imposition of Jim Crow and racial segregation laws, whites committed an increased rate of lynchings of blacks, mostly men, beginning in the 1890s and extending to 1930. Cotton crops failed due to boll weevil infestation and successive severe flooding in 1912 and 1913, creating crisis conditions for many African Americans. With control of the ballot box and more <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>credit,</b> white planters bought out such farmers, expanding their ownership of Delta bottomlands.

25|$|The partial {{privatisation}} left ADMARC {{with limited}} funds to supply fertilizer and seed to smallholders, and {{the closure of}} many of its depots hindered distribution. Credit was also tightened and from 1988 until 1992 (when donors funded alternatives) smallholders had little <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>credit.</b> An increase in maize producer prices in 1988 did not compensate farmers who had previously grown hybrid maize for their lost subsidies, so many reverted to growing local maize. After privatisation had increased competition, ADMARC reduced its maize sales, but by 1988 it had to support over 500,000 Mozambican refugees, and could not replenish its stocks from the poor harvests of the late 1980s. Its weakness led to increased consumer prices and reduced food security.|$|E

25|$|From 1971, ADMARC subsidised {{fertilizer}} {{for every}} farmer. Estates benefited most, as tobacco needed more fertilizer than maize did. Estates also had <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>credit</b> and, without this, few smallholders could buy enough fertilizer, {{even when it}} was subsidised. After 1985, declining world tobacco prices and supporting the estates made ADMARC insolvent. The Malawi government agreed to partially privatise it to obtain World Bank loans.

A complete withdrawal of these subsidies prevented 75% of smallholders buying fertilizer in 1988/89: a 25% subsidy was restored for 1989/90 and 1990/91 but removed in 1991/92. A temporary 11% subsidy was provided from 1992/93 to 1994/95 only.|$|E
