50|$|The College of Dentistry has an <b>audiovisual</b> <b>unit,</b> which {{provides}} teaching aid services, overhead projectors, transparent pojectors, models, mannequins, modern computer display equivalent, televisions, videos and cassette recorders; it also provide medical photography {{services for the}} faculty staff and students. Along with this there is a computer laboratory for students, not only to enhance their computer skills but to use this powerful tool for learning as well.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the organizational characteristics of two college learning resource centers as compared with two traditionally organized college libraries with separate <b>audiovisual</b> <b>units</b> {{in order to determine the}} advantages of each organizational type. Interviews, observation, and examination of relevant documents were used to determine organizational characteristics, types and qualities of resources, facilities, staffing, and services at each institution. The author concluded that the services provided by the two types of organizations are not necessarily different, and that the attitudes of director and staff have the most important influence on the success of the service. A bibliography, letters, and interview documents are attached. (LS...|$|R

He {{is in charge of the}} Media Directorate - which {{includes}} the press service, the online communication <b>unit,</b> <b>audiovisual</b> services and the online television 'EuroparlTV'-, the Citizens' Relations Directorate and the information offices of the European Parliament in the Member States.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Navy {{possesses}} {{the capability to}} produce audiovisual products in the Fleet Audiovisual Command, Pacific; the Fleet Imagery Command, Atlantic; the Fleet Combat Camera Groups; Naval Imaging Command; various film libraries; and limited capability from ships and aircraft of the fleet. A Naval Reserve PSYOP <b>audiovisual</b> <b>unit</b> supports the Atlantic Fleet. Navy personnel assets {{have the capability to}} produce documents, posters, articles, and other material suitable for PSYOP. Administrative capabilities exist ashore and afloat that prepare and produce various quantities of printed materials. Language capabilities exist in naval intelligence and among naval personnel for most European and Asian languages. The Fleet Tactical Readiness Group provides equipment and technical maintenance support to conduct civil radio broadcasts and broadcast jamming in the amplitude modulation frequency band. This unit is not trained to produce PSYOP products and must be augmented with PSYOP personnel or linguists when necessary. The unit is capable of being fully operational within 48 hours of receipt of tasking. The unit's equipment consists of a 10.6 kW AM band broadcast radio transmitter; a broadcast studio van; antenna tuner; two antennas (a pneumatically raised 100 ft top-loaded antenna mast and a 500 ft wire helium balloon antenna); and a 30 kW generator that provides power to the system.|$|E
3000|$|Our {{audiovisual}} synthesis {{system is}} designed {{as an extension of}} our unit selection auditory TTS system, which uses a Viterbi search on cost functions to select the optimal sequence of long nonuniform units from the database [20]. The cost of selecting a particular <b>audiovisual</b> <b>unit</b> includes target cost functions that indicate how well this segment matches the target speech, and join cost functions that indicate how well two consecutive segments can be concatenated without creating disturbing artifacts. To use with our multimodal unit selection technique, these cost functions are needed for the audio track {{as well as for the}} video track, since the selection of a particular <b>audiovisual</b> <b>unit</b> will depend on the properties of both these modes. Therefore, the cost [...]...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} program aims to evaluate whether: drivers {{are likely to}} attend to the visual materials from an in-vehicle <b>audiovisual</b> <b>unit</b> that is visible from the back of another vehicle [survey]; the visual materials from an in-vehicle audiovisual display unit positioned as in the back of an adjacent vehicle impairs driving performance [Experiment 2]; the audio materials from an in-vehicle audiovisual display unit impairs driving performance [Experiment 1]...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an initial bimodal acoustic-visual synthesis system {{able to generate}} concurrently the speech signal and a 3 D animation of the speaker's face. This is done by concatenating bimodal diphone units that consist of both acoustic and visual information. The latter is acquired using a stereovision technique. The proposed method addresses the problems of asyn- chrony and incoherence inherent in classic approaches to <b>audiovisual</b> synthesis. <b>Unit</b> selection is based on classic target and join costs from acoustic-only synthesis, which are augmented with a visual join cost. Preliminary results indicate the benefits of this approach, since both the synthesized speech signal and the face animation are of good quality...|$|R
40|$|A new more {{comprehensive}} system for cataloging audiovisual materials is described. Existing audiovisual cataloging systems contain mostly descriptive information, publishers' or producers' summaries, and order information. This paper discusses {{the addition of}} measurable learning objectives to this standard information, thereby enabling the potential user to determine what {{can be learned from}} a particular <b>audiovisual</b> <b>unit.</b> The project included media in nursing only. A committee of faculty and students from the University of Alabama in Birmingham School of Nursing reviewed the materials. The system was field-tested at nursing schools throughout Alabama; the schools offered four different types of programs. The system and its sample product, the AVLOC catalog, were also evaluated by medical librarians, media specialists, and other nursing instructors throughout the United States...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an application which enables the computer-assisted generation of Dublin Core-based metadata descriptions and online digital visual summaries for videos. It is a Java application which integrates a video replay window with vcr-type controls and metadata input forms generated from an hierarchical RDF schema. The schema definition {{is also used}} to validate the descriptions input by the user and control the format of the output. The generated metadata descriptions can be saved as RDF, HTML or to a database. They can be used to enable metadata interchange, searching across the Internet or dynamic generation of detailed visual summaries for video browsing. This prototype system has been developed for the State Library of Queensland 2 Ì† 7 s (SLQ) <b>Audiovisual</b> <b>unit</b> to enable quick, easy, cost-effective generation of standardized metadata which can be used to create online detailed visual summaries of the latest video acquisitions...|$|E
