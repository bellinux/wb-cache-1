500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Christina Milian was mixed; critics who gave a positive review enjoyed the catchy tracks and lead single [...] "AM to PM", while others {{found that it}} lacked original ideas. The album peaked at number 23 in the UK, selling a total of 101,986 copies, and achieved Silver certification. Internationally, the album also charted in the Netherlands, Sweden and France. The album spawned two singles, [...] "AM to PM" [...] <b>and</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> <b>Look</b> at Me", which charted worldwide.|$|E
500|$|The {{match was}} hailed {{as one of the}} most {{exciting}} finals in modern times, with Alan Hansen declaring: [...] "the best final ever." [...] Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier hailed his players after the match: [...] "When you play in a European final, you are looking for immortality. People remember who was playing <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at programmes from finals you just recall the facts of the game. These boys have produced a game which will be remembered for a long time — and that is thanks to Alavés too." [...] Houllier hit back at critics that had labelled Liverpool as boring before the match: [...] "Maybe we are a boring side — as I seem to keep reading — but I will put up with that. We must have scored 122 of our 123 goals on the counter attack, but all I know is that our total this season is the third highest in Liverpool's history." ...|$|E

2500|$|The rebel team {{played two}} {{series against the}} South African team—in 1985–86 and 1986–87—and lost them both 1 [...] "Test" [...] to nil. In the first series, Hughes left himself {{stranded}} on 97 when the second [...] "Test" [...] at Newlands in Cape Town ended in a draw. In the following match at Wanderers in Johannesburg, Hughes was dismissed for a golden pair; dismissed by first ball he faced in both innings. Hughes scored 585 runs {{at an average of}} 45.00 in the 1985–86 South African season and followed that with 596 runs at an average of 42.57 in 1986–87. In 2007, Hughes reflected on his participation in the rebel tours: [...] "Cricket was at the forefront of trying to break down barriers <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> how cricket has developed in South Africa I was very pleased to be involved." ...|$|E

In {{an interview with}} MTV News Ciara said that creating her fifth album was the most personal experience of her career thus far. She elaborated that she had asked close friend and collaborator Missy Elliott to review her early progress on Ciara, [...] "I always share my projects with her early. I'll go to her house and play her the records really early in the process, and it's always so cool, but I just have to pinch myself in moments when I see her a lot. I'll be like, 'OK, this is really my friend,' but it's dope because I really respect her.

First (S. 204), {{you have}} Apollo {{ascending}} from the sea; {{thought of as}} the physical sunrise: only a circle of light for his head; his chariot horses, seen foreshortened, black against the day-break, their feet not yet risen above the horizon. Underneath is the painting from {{the opposite side of the}} same vase: Athena as the morning breeze, and Hermes as the morning cloud, flying across the waves before the sunrise. At the distance I now hold them from you, it is scarcely possible for you to see that they are figures at all, so like are they to broken fragments of flying mist; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> close, you will see that as Apollo's face is invisible in the circle of light, Mercury's is invisible in the broken form of cloud: but I can tell you that it is conceived as reverted, looking back to Athena; the grotesque appearance of feature in the front is the outline of his hair.|$|E

60|$|I saw, {{all sorts}} of things! Immediately before me I saw the {{excitement}} of little Fyne--mere food for wonder. Further off, {{in a sort of}} gloom and beyond the light of day and the movement of the street, I saw the figure of a man, stiff like a ramrod, moving with small steps, a slight girlish figure by his side. And the gloom was like the gloom of villainous slums, of misery, of wretchedness, of a starved and degraded existence. It was a relief that I could see only their shabby hopeless backs. He was an awful ghost. But indeed to call him a ghost was only a refinement of polite speech, and a manner of concealing one's terror of such things. Prisons are wonderful contrivances. Shut--open. Very neat. Shut--open. And out comes some sort of corpse, to wander awfully {{in a world in which}} it has no possible connections and carrying with it the appalling tainted atmosphere of its silent abode. Marvellous arrangement. It works automatically, <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at it, the perfection makes you sick; which for a mere mechanism is no mean triumph. Sick and scared. It had nearly scared that poor girl to her death. Fancy having to take such a thing by the hand! Now I understood the remorseful strain I had detected in her speeches.|$|E
60|$|L. Well, Lucilla, {{the answer}} will much {{depend upon the}} {{clearness}} of your faith in {{the personality of the}} spirits which are described in the book of your own religion;--their personality, observe, as distinguished from merely symbolical visions. For instance, when Jeremiah has the vision of the seething pot with its mouth to the north, you know that this which he sees is not a real thing; but merely a significant dream. Also, when Zachariah sees the speckled horses among the myrtle trees in the bottom, you still may suppose the vision symbolical;--you do not think of them as real spirits, like Pegasus, seen in the form of horses. But when you are told of the four riders in the Apocalypse, a distinct sense of personality begins to force itself upon you. And though you might, in a dull temper, think that (for one instance of all) the fourth rider on the pale horse was merely a symbol of the power of death,--in your stronger and more earnest moods you will rather conceive of him as a real and living angel. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> back from the vision of the Apocalypse to the account of the destruction of the Egyptian first-born, and of the army of Sennacherib, and again to David's vision at the threshing floor of Araunah, the idea of personality in this death-angel becomes entirely defined, just as in the appearance of the angels to Abraham, Manoah, or Mary.|$|E
