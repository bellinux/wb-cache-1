5|$|Without treatment, {{an acute}} {{attack of gout}} usually {{resolves}} in five to seven days; however, 60% of people have a second attack within one year. Those with gout <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and kidney and cardiovascular disease and thus <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of death. It is unclear whether medications that lower urate affect cardiovascular disease risks. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, {{but some of the}} increased risk appears to be independent.|$|E
5|$|Persons with {{spinal cord}} injury <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for urinary tract {{infection}} in part because of chronic use of catheter, and in part because of voiding dysfunction. It is {{the most common cause of}} infection in this population, as well as the most common cause of hospitalization. Additionally, use of cranberry juice or cranberry supplement appears to be ineffective in prevention and treatment in this population.|$|E
5|$|Farm {{animals such as}} {{cows and}} horses as well as pet animals are also {{susceptible}} {{to the effects of}} lead toxicity. Sources of lead exposure in pets can be the same as those that present health threats to humans sharing the environment, such as paint and blinds, and there is sometimes lead in toys made for pets. Lead poisoning in a pet dog may indicate that children in the same household <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for elevated lead levels.|$|E
25|$|Long-term, an {{individual}} with preeclampsia <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for recurrence of pre-eclampsia in subsequent pregnancies.|$|R
50|$|Women who {{are younger}} than 20 <b>are</b> <b>at</b> higher risk and women older than 35 <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>risk</b> {{as they get}} older.|$|R
50|$|Individuals with pseudocholinesterase {{deficiency}} {{also may}} <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of toxic reactions, including sudden cardiac death, associated with recreational use of cocaine.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} other factors are less closely linked to COPD. The risk is greater in those who are poor, {{although}} it is not clear if this is due to poverty itself or other risk factors associated with poverty, such as air pollution and malnutrition. There is tentative evidence that those with asthma and airway hyperreactivity <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of COPD. Birth factors such as low birth weight may also play a role as do a number of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear to increase the risk of COPD, at least in adults.|$|E
5|$|Preterm newborns {{are known}} to be at higher risk for bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen. Other groups at higher risk for oxygen toxicity are patients on mechanical ventilation with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50%, and patients exposed to chemicals that increase risk for oxygen toxicity such the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin. Therefore, current guidelines for patients on mechanical ventilation in intensive care recommends keeping oxygen concentration less than 60%. Likewise, divers who undergo treatment of decompression sickness <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of oxygen toxicity as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions, in addition to any oxygen exposure during the dive.|$|E
25|$|Second-impact {{syndrome}} shares all {{the risk}} factors of concussion; that is, those who <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for concussion are also at higher risk for SIS. Thus, people who participate in sports such as boxing, soccer, American football, baseball, rugby, basketball, ice hockey, pro wrestling, and skiing (especially Alpine) <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk.</b> The condition most commonly occurs in American football.|$|E
50|$|Women who test {{positive}} for thyroid antibodies may <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of developing symptoms associated with postpartum depression than women without thyroid antibodies.|$|R
50|$|People with Laron {{syndrome}} have strikingly {{low rates}} of cancer and diabetes, although they appear to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of accidental death due to their stature.|$|R
30|$|To summarise, {{individuals}} with bipolar disorder who reported experiencing maltreatment during childhood, especially abuse, <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of suffering from medical illnesses and warrant greater clinical attention.|$|R
25|$|Fair- and red-haired people, {{persons with}} {{multiple}} atypical nevi or dysplastic nevi and persons born with giant congenital melanocytic nevi <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|E
25|$|Individuals taking {{sirolimus}} <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> {{of experiencing}} impaired or delayed wound healing, {{particularly if they}} have a high body mass index (i.e., a BMI of ≥30kg/m2).|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{with chronic}} kidney disease, {{diabetes}} mellitus, high blood pressure, reduced intravascular volume, {{or who are}} elderly <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of developing CIN after exposure to iodinated contrast.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} examines {{mental health}} correlates of different victim-perpetrator relationships among adolescent victims of interpersonal violence. A large and nationally {{representative sample of}} adolescents (N = 4, 023) responded to structured telephone interviews concerning mental health functioning (post-traumatic stress disorder—PTSD, major depressive disorder, substance abuse/dependence, and delinquency). Those reporting histories of sexual (n = 321) and/or physical (n = 688) assault were queried about specific aspects of their assaults, including {{their relationship with the}} perpetrator. After control-ling for demographic- and assault-related risk factors, the victim-perpetrator relationship remained a significant risk factor for mental health problems. Adolescents sexually assaulted by nonstrangers <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for PTSD; those sexually assaulted by acquaintances or people they did not know well <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for delinquency. Adolescents who were physically assaulted by a family member <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for PTSD. Explanations for the findings and the need for consistent assessment methods across related studies are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Campylobacter {{organisms are}} {{isolated}} more frequently from males than females. Homosexual men appear to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for infection with atypical Campylobacter {{species such as}} Helicobacter cinaedi and Helicobacter fennelliae.|$|R
50|$|Alcohol has cross {{tolerance}} with GABAA receptor positive modulators {{such as the}} benzodiazepines and the nonbenzodiazepine drugs. For this reason, alcoholics or recovering alcoholics may <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> {{of physical}} dependency on zolpidem. Also, alcoholics and drug abusers may <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of abusing and or becoming psychologically dependent on zolpidem. It should be avoided in those {{with a history of}} alcoholism, drug misuse, physical dependency, or psychological dependency on sedative-hypnotic drugs. Zolpidem has rarely been associated with drug-seeking behavior, the risk of which is amplified in patients with a history of drug or alcohol abuse.|$|R
25|$|Epidemiological studies {{indicate}} that Radiographers employed before 1950 <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of leukemia and skin cancer, most likely {{due to the lack}} of use of radiation monitoring and shielding.|$|E
25|$|Children at 6–12 months <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of {{developing}} dental caries. For other kids aged 12–18 months, dental caries develop on primary teeth and approximately twice yearly for permanent teeth.|$|E
25|$|Amniocentesis is the {{national}} standard (in what country) for women over 35 or who reach 35 by mid pregnancy or who <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> by family history or prior birth history.|$|E
40|$|Exercise {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} acute chordae rupture, {{which is one of}} the {{important}} and emergent differential diagnoses in approaching a patient presenting with dyspnea. Several common diseases such as rheumatic heart disease and infectious diseases have been known to cause chordae rupture. Severe mitral valve prolapse had been reported to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for chordal rupture. Because mitral valve prolapse may present in up to 10 % of healthy individuals, primary care practitioners should recognize that certain patients with mitral valve prolapse who engage in athletics may <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for such a rare but emergent complication...|$|R
25|$|In the 1970s, {{scientists}} first observed Ang II to {{harm the}} heart and kidneys, and individuals {{with high levels of}} renin activity in plasma <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of myocardial infarction and stroke.|$|R
25|$|Years of {{clean-up}} will drag into decades. A permanent {{exclusion zone}} {{could end up}} stretching beyond the plant’s perimeter. Seriously exposed workers may <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of cancers {{for the rest of}} their lives...|$|R
25|$|A {{family history}} of ovarian cancer is {{a risk factor for}} ovarian cancer. People with {{hereditary}} nonpolyposis colon cancer (Lynch Syndrome), and those with BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genetic abnormalities <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|E
25|$|Patients {{with the}} acute porphyrias (AIP, HCP, VP) <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> over their life for {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma (primary liver cancer) and may require monitoring. Other typical {{risk factors for}} liver cancer need not be present.|$|E
25|$|A {{family history}} of {{melanoma}} greatly increases a person's risk because mutations in several genes {{have been found in}} melanoma-prone families. People with a history of one melanoma <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of developing a second primary tumor.|$|E
30|$|Consideration {{should be}} given to {{endoscopic}} surgical management in such cases. In subsequent pregnancies, early ultrasound assessment is vital to locate the site of conceptus as these patients would <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of tubal pregnancy.|$|R
50|$|Teriparatide {{should not}} be {{prescribed}} for people who <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risks</b> for osteosarcoma. This includes those with Paget's Disease of bone or unexplained elevations of serum alkaline phosphate, open epiphysis, or prior radiation therapy involving the skeleton.|$|R
50|$|A {{computer}} {{that does not}} have a reasonably up-to-date webcam software or any anti-virus (or firewall) software installed and operational may <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for Camfecting. Softcams may nominally <b>increase</b> this <b>risk,</b> if not maintained or configured properly.|$|R
25|$|Infants {{exposed to}} {{erythromycin}} <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for developing hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, {{especially when the}} drug is taken around two weeks of life and possibly in late pregnancy and through breastmilk {{in the first two}} weeks of life.|$|E
25|$|These are {{associated}} with insulin resistance and are risk factors {{for the development of}} type 2 diabetes mellitus. Those in this stratum (IGT or IFG) <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of cardiovascular disease. Of the two, impaired glucose tolerance better predicts cardiovascular disease and mortality.|$|E
25|$|The LGBT {{homeless}} <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> {{of violence}} {{compared to other}} groups. Transgender people are also at danger of being placed into the incorrect shelters. In some cases, transgender women can be turned away from women's shelters. This can place their safety at risk.|$|E
25|$|Most {{patients}} with ischemic colitis recover fully, although the prognosis {{depends on the}} severity of the ischemia. Patients with pre-existing peripheral vascular disease or ischemia of the ascending (right) colon may <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for complications or death.|$|R
2500|$|Findings {{from another}} study {{indicate}} that the fewer people know about a lesbian's sexual orientation, the more anxiety, less positive affectivity, and lower self-esteem she has.
