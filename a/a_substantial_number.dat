5|$|Boult's {{recordings}} {{fall into}} three main periods. In the first, from 1920 {{to the end}} of the 1940s, he recorded almost exclusively for HMV. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he was less in demand by the major labels, and although he made <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>number</b> of discs for Decca, he recorded mostly for smaller labels, chiefly Pye Nixa. His last period, from the mid-1960s, sometimes referred to as his Indian Summer, was once again with HMV. With his regular collaborators the producer Christopher Bishop and the engineer Christopher Parker he made more than sixty recordings, re-recording much of his key repertoire in stereo. He also added many works to his discography that he had not recorded before.|$|E

Fox canceled the show {{at the end of its}} first and only season. In 2006, Warner Home Video released a DVD set containing all 27 episodes.

Serbian historians have used this second source to talk of a Great Migration of Serbs.

5|$|Henry had a {{considerable}} sexual appetite and enjoyed <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>number</b> of sexual partners, {{resulting in a}} large number of illegitimate children, at least nine sons and 13 daughters, many of whom he appears to have recognised and supported. It was normal for unmarried Anglo-Norman noblemen to have sexual relations with prostitutes and local women, and kings were also expected to have mistresses. Some of these relationships occurred before Henry was married, but many others took place after his marriage to Matilda. Henry had a wide range of mistresses from a range of backgrounds, and the relationships appear to have been conducted relatively openly. He may have chosen some of his noble mistresses for political purposes, but the evidence to support this theory is limited.|$|E

In 1983, most of this community united with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia and became an Old Ritualist priest within the canonical Orthodox Church.

40|$|Peptide {{receptor}} {{radionuclide therapy}} {{is a new}} treatment modality for patients with inoperable or metastasised neuroendocrine gastroenteropancreatic tumours. After the successful implementation of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy in daily clinical practice, {{the next logical step}} was to increase the radiation dose of the administered radiolabelled somatostatin analogue in an attempt to induce tumour shrinkage. Since then, an increasing number of patients has been successfully treated with this approach, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>numbers</b> of patient with objective tumour shrinkage. Serious side-effects have been rare. This article reviews the effectiveness of the different radiolabelled somatostatin analogues used, the currently known side-effects and the survival data available. Furthermore, clinical issues, including indication and timing of therapy, are discussed. Finally, important directions for future research are briefly mentioned to illustrate that, although the currently available results already suggest a favourable outcome compared with other systemic therapies, new strategies are being developed to increase efficacy...|$|R

Cross-cultural studies have increasingly been interested in investigating what happen to people who have grown up in one culture when they move to another cultural environment. Although there are <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>numbers</b> of South Asian immigrants in Hong Kong, very little is known about their experiences of acculturation and adaptation, the challenges and opportunities they encounter.

For a time after the Sino-Soviet split, China was also actively competing for influence in the developing world, including activities in Somalia. Beginning in the 1960s, the US engaged in development projects in Somalia to counter the influence of communism. Staff from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which carried out most of these projects, comprised <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>number</b> of the embassy's staff during the next three decades.

In addition, students at the two schools can cross-register for credits toward their own school's degrees without any additional fees. A cross-registration program between MIT and Wellesley College has also existed since 1969, and in 2002 the Cambridge–MIT Institute launched an undergraduate exchange program between MIT and the University of Cambridge.
