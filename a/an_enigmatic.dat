5|$|Trachylepis tschudii is <b>an</b> <b>enigmatic</b> skink, purportedly from Peru. First {{described}} in 1845 {{on the basis}} of a single specimen, it may be the same as the Noronha skink (T.atlantica) from Fernando de Noronha, off northeastern Brazil. T.tschudii represents one of two doubtful records of the otherwise African genus Trachylepis on mainland South America; the other is T.maculata from Guyana.|$|E
5|$|A single tooth, MACN Pv-RN 248, is {{currently}} {{identified as a}} Ferugliotherium upper molariform. In 1992, Krause and colleagues labeled it as a right MF1, but Gurovich identifies it as a left MF1 or possibly even a right mf1. LACM 149371, <b>an</b> <b>enigmatic</b> tooth from the Paleogene of Santa Rosa, Peru, may represent an upper molar of an animal related to Ferugliotherium. Like the latter, it has cusps that are compressed {{from front to back}} and that are connected {{to the center of the}} crown by low crests.|$|E

5|$|Diodorus {{says that}} more than 1,000 Athenians died in the battle, with another 2,000 taken prisoner, and that the Thebans fared similarly. Plutarch {{suggests}} that all 300 of the Sacred Band were killed at the battle, having previously been seen as invincible. In the Roman period, the 'Lion of Chaeronea', <b>an</b> <b>enigmatic</b> monument {{on the site of}} the battle, was believed to mark the resting place of the Sacred Band. Modern excavations found the remains of 254 soldiers underneath the monument; it is therefore generally accepted that this was indeed the grave of the Sacred Band, since it is unlikely that every member was killed.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, some {{possible}} close relatives of Ferugliotherium were discovered. <b>An</b> <b>enigmatic</b> tooth from the Paleogene of Peru, LACM 149371, {{was described in}} 2004 as possibly related to the family Ferugliotheriidae. Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues described a p4 from the La Colonia Formation (Late Cretaceous of Argentina) as a new multituberculate genus, Argentodites, in 2007, but Gurovich and Beck noted close similarities between this p4 and the p4 in the possible jaw fragment of Ferugliotherium and suggested that it represented Ferugliotherium or a closely related species. A single mf1 from the Allen Formation (Late Cretaceous of Argentina) was described as another ferugliotheriid genus, Trapalcotherium, in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Lavanify is a {{mammalian}} genus {{from the}} late Cretaceous (probably Maastrichtian, about 71 to 66 million years ago) of Madagascar. The only species, L.miolaka, is known from two isolated teeth, {{one of which is}} damaged. The teeth were collected in 1995–1996 and described in 1997. The animal is classified as a member of Gondwanatheria, <b>an</b> <b>enigmatic</b> extinct group with unclear phylogenetic relationships, and within Gondwanatheria {{as a member of the}} family Sudamericidae. Lavanify is most closely related to the Indian Bharattherium; the South American Sudamerica and Gondwanatherium are more distantly related. Gondwanatheres probably ate hard plant material.|$|E

The Shapeshifter's allegiance was to the fallen Xel'Naga Amon, and accordingly its actions were to further Amon's own goals.|$|E

The story of the game's single player campaign focuses on a war in the 24th century between two factions, one human and the other alien, that is interrupted in its fourteenth year by the arrival of <b>an</b> <b>enigmatic</b> and militant alien race, whose genocidal advance forces the two sides into a ceasefire in order to work together to halt the threat.|$|E
5|$|Ghost {{takes place}} in the fictional {{universe}} of the StarCraft series. The series is set in a distant part of the galaxy called the Koprulu Sector and begins in the year 2499. Terran exiles from Earth are governed by a totalitarian empire, the Terran Dominion, that is opposed by several smaller rebel groups. Two alien races discover humanity: the insectoid Zerg, who begin to invade planets controlled by the Terrans; and the Protoss, <b>an</b> <b>enigmatic</b> race with strong psionic power that attempt to eradicate the Zerg. Ghost takes place four years after the conclusion of , in which the Zerg become the dominant power in the sector and leave both the Protoss and the Dominion in ruins.

5|$|LACM 149371 (Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County {{specimen}} 149371) is <b>an</b> <b>enigmatic</b> fossil mammalian tooth {{from the}} Paleogene (66 to 23 million years ago, mya) of Peru. It {{is from the}} Santa Rosa fossil site, which is of uncertain age but possibly late Eocene (55 to 34 mya) or Oligocene (34 to 23 mya). The tooth is poorly preserved {{and may have been}} degraded by acidic water or because it passed through a predator's digestive tract. Its largest dimension is 2.65mm. It is triangular in shape and bears six cusps that surround the middle of the tooth, where there are three basins (fossae). Crests connects the cusps and separate the fossae. The microscopic structure of the enamel is poorly preserved.|$|E
