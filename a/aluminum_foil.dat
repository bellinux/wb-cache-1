5|$|The {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes since its inception. Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company was able to tout its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with waxed paper. For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil</b> wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich. The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a paper board box.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{vertically}} aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) {{grown on}} <b>aluminum</b> <b>foils</b> {{were used as}} flexible supercapacitor electrodes. <b>Aluminum</b> <b>foils</b> were used as readily available, cheap and conductive substrates, and VACNTs were grown directly on these foils through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.

5|$|Domestic cats select food {{based on}} its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most {{strongly}} to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats may reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past. They may also avoid sugary foods and milk. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugars in milk are not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea. They can also develop odd eating habits. Some cats like to eat or chew on other things, most commonly wool, but also plastic, cables, paper, string, <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil,</b> or even coal. This condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten.|$|E
5|$|Khambatta also faced {{difficulties}} during filming. Due to the actress' personal objections, {{she would}} not appear nude as {{called for in the}} script during the Ilia probe's appearance. The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but she caught a cold {{as a result of the}} shower mist, created by dropping dry ice into warm water and funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube. Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia. One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated cardboard covered in <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil,</b> and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button in the hollow of the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E
5|$|As August ended, {{production}} {{continued to}} slip farther behind schedule. Koenig learned {{that rather than}} being released in 14 days after his scenes were completed, his last day would be on October 26—eight weeks later than expected. The next bridge scenes to be filmed after the wormhole sequence, Enterprises approach to V'Ger and the machine's resulting attack, were postponed for two weeks so that the special effects for the scene could be planned and implemented, and the engine room scenes could be shot. Chekov's burns sustained in V'Ger's attack were difficult to film; though the incident took only minutes on film, Weldon spent hours preparing the effect. A piece of <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil</b> was placed around Koenig's arm, covered by a protective pad and then hidden by the uniform sleeve. Weldon prepared an ammonia and acetic acid solution that was touched to Koenig's sleeve, causing it to smoke. Difficulties resulted in the scene being shot ten times; it was especially uncomfortable for the actor, whose arm was slightly burned {{when some of the}} solution leaked through to his arm.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel technique for joining similar and dissimilar metal foils, namely micro clinching with cutting by laser shock forming. A {{series of experiments}} were conducted to study the deformation behavior of single layer material, during which many important process parameters were determined. The process window of the 1060 pure <b>aluminum</b> <b>foils</b> and annealed copper foils produced by micro clinching with cutting was analyzed. Moreover, similar material combination (annealed copper foils) and dissimilar material combination (1060 pure <b>aluminum</b> <b>foils</b> and 304 stainless steel foils) were successfully achieved. The effect of laser energy on the interlock and minimum thickness of upper foils was investigated. In addition, the mechanical strength of different material combinations joined by micro clinching with cutting was measured in single lap shearing tests. According to the achieved results, this novel technique is more suitable for material combinations where the upper foil is thicker than lower foil. With the increase of laser energy, the interlock increased while the minimum thickness of upper foil decreased gradually. The shear strength of 1060 pure <b>aluminum</b> <b>foils</b> and 304 stainless steel foils combination was three times as large as that of 1060 pure <b>aluminum</b> <b>foils</b> and annealed copper foils combination...|$|R

SEM images from the <b>aluminum</b> <b>foils</b> show that their surface is rough on the (sub) micron scale.

Unlike the Coon, Professor Chaos and General Disarray have become as {{familiar}} to the residents of South Park as Mysterion. Butters also wants to know the identity of Mysterion but can only narrow the list of suspects to the boys from Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class whose shapes do not differ greatly from that of others. In contrast, he has nearly pinned down Coon's identity to a few fat celebrities, and Cartman. In a scheme to uncover Mysterion's identity, the Coon convinces Professor Chaos to threaten {{the destruction of a}} hospital unless Mysterion reveals his identity. After the Coon plants the TNT and leaves to buy detonators, Mysterion unexpectedly arrives. He points out that this is not Professor Chaos' usual style, and fights Professor Chaos and General Disarray on top of the building. A crowd forms below and cheers on Mysterion as the police take no actions, believing that their bullets are no match for Professor Chaos' <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil</b> armor. Dramatically, the Coon appears to fight on the side of Mysterion, with the hopes that he too will be hailed as a hero. At that point, Professor Chaos and General Disarray run off in defeat. After their victory, the Coon convinces Mysterion to unmask himself by claiming such threats to public safety will continue until Mysterion's secret is revealed.|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to develop and {{validate}} a common process for separating the active materials from the copper and <b>aluminum</b> <b>foils</b> of post-vehicle-application lithium-ion batteries. Batteries from two different manufacturers were disassembled, and anode and cathode samples were used for recycling testing. The materials tested from a third manufacturer were scraps of coated foils from the manufacturing process {{that had never been}} assembled into cells. The cathodes from each manufacturer were <b>aluminum</b> <b>foils</b> with coatings of differing chemistries. The anode foils from each manufacturer were copper with a carbon coating. The process developed used acid baths to separate the active materials from the foils. To allow for separation of the differing active materials (depending on supplier and battery chemistry) from the foils, the acids were selected to react with the <b>aluminum</b> and copper <b>foils.</b> The processes were stopped once sufficient reaction had occurred so that the coatings no longer adhered to the foils. The optimum recycling condition was identified as the lowest acid concentration, the lowest temperature, and the shortest time required for full separation of the coatings from the foils for all cell chemistries (manufacturers). Full separation of the graphite coating from the copper foils of the anodes was achieved within 35  s by using 0.5 mol/L of H 2 SO 4 (sulfuric acid) at 40  °C. Full separation of the active materials from the <b>aluminum</b> <b>foils</b> of the cathodes was achieved within 83  s by using 2.0 mol/L of HNO 3 (nitric acid) at 70  °C.|$|R
