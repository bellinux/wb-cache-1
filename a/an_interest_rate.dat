5|$|On 26 July 2012, for {{the first}} time since September 2010, Ireland was able to return to the {{financial}} markets, selling over €5 billion in long-term government debt, with <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> of 5.9% for the 5-year bonds and 6.1% for the 8-year bonds at sale. In December 2013, after three years on financial life support, Ireland finally left the EU/IMF bailout programme, although it retained a debt of €22.5 billion to the IMF; in August 2014, early repayment of €15 billion was being considered, which would save the country €375 million in surcharges. Despite the end of the bailout the country's unemployment rate remains high and public sector wages are still around 20% lower than at the beginning of the crisis. Government debt reached 123.7% of GDP in 2013.|$|E

50|$|A high {{inflation}} rate with <b>a</b> low nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> result in <b>a</b> negative real <b>interest</b> rate; for example, <b>a</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> of 1% and an {{inflation rate}} of 4% yields <b>a</b> real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> of (approximately) &minus;3%. <b>As</b> lower (real) <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{are associated with}} stimulating the economy under monetary policy, the higher inflation is, the more flexibility a central bank has in setting (nominal) <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> while still keeping them nonnegative; negative (nominal) <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are considered unconventional monetary policy and have very rarely been practiced.|$|R
50|$|The {{assumption}} of the same cash flows for each link in the chain is essentially an {{assumption of}} zero inflation, so <b>a</b> real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> rather than <b>a</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is commonly used in the calculations.|$|R
25|$|Hedgers {{typically}} include {{producers and}} consumers of a commodity or {{the owner of}} an asset or assets subject to certain influences such as <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E

25|$|Interest rate risk: {{the risk}} that the {{relative}} value of an interest-bearing liability, such as a loan or a bond, will worsen due to <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> increase. Interest rate risks can be hedged using fixed-income instruments or interest rate swaps.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{insurance}} {{protects the}} holder from rising <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{but does not}} raise their initial pay <b>rate,</b> if <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> fall, the policyholder will see a benefit in reduced payments on their mortgage or loan when compared to a fixed rate alternative.|$|R

25|$|The {{effective}} interest rate, effective annual interest rate, annual equivalent rate (AER) {{or simply}} effective rate is {{the interest rate}} on a loan or financial product restated from the nominal interest rate as <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> with annual compound interest payable in arrears.|$|E
25|$|Virtually all {{central banks}} set <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> target, and conduct open market {{operations}} to ensure base interest rates remain at that target level. According to MMT the issuing of government bonds is best understood as an operation to offset government spending rather than a requirement to finance it.|$|E
25|$|<b>An</b> <b>{{interest}}</b> <b>rate</b> is {{the amount}} of interest due per period, as a proportion of the amount lent, deposited or borrowed (called the principal sum). The total interest on an amount lent or borrowed depends on the principal sum, the interest rate, the compounding frequency, and the length of time over which it is lent, deposited or borrowed.|$|E
5000|$|Tracker rate - a {{variable}} rate that {{is equal to}} <b>a</b> published <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> (typically LIBOR, plus <b>a</b> fixed <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> margin. For instance LIBOR + 1.5%, so if at any time LIBOR is 4% per year, the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> charged to the borrower would be 5.5% per year.|$|R
2500|$|For example, <b>a</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> of 6% {{compounded}} monthly {{is equivalent}} to <b>an</b> effective <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> of 6.17%. [...] 6% compounded monthly is credited as 6%/12 = 0.005 every month. After one year, the initial capital is increased by the factor (1+0.005)12 ≈ 1.0617.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> forward <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is <b>a</b> type of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> that is {{specified}} {{for a loan}} {{that will}} occur at a specified future date. <b>As</b> with current <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> forward <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> include <b>a</b> term structure which shows the different forward rates offered to loans of different maturities. According to the unbiased expectations hypothesis, forward <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> predict spot <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{at the time the}} loan is actually made, but many analysts dispute whether this is true.|$|R
25|$|In {{answer to}} the {{complaint}} that it is unjust to have an income fixed (by <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate)</b> for the lender while the profits of the borrower can never know with complete certainly, capital markets give greater returns (on average) for greater risk, and the lower risk of a fixed income return is compensated with lower returns (on average) than returns from shared profits.|$|E
25|$|The Trump Building at 40 Wall Street: Trump {{bought and}} renovated this {{building}} for $1 million in 1995. The pre-tax {{net operating income}} at the building as of 2011 was US$20.89 million and is valued at $350 to $400 million, according to the New York Department of Finance. Trump took out a $160 million mortgage attached to the property with <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> of 5.71% to use for other investments. Forbes valued the property at $260 million in 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{second problem}} is that public spending, which rose steeply in the 2000s, was now unsustainable. The total Irish budget deficit as of December 2010, stood at 93.4 billion with General Government Debt at 148.6 billion or 94.2% of GDP. As {{it was not clear}} how much money would be needed to {{revitalise}} the banks – to clear their debts and supply them with enough money to start lending again – the international markets were unwilling to lend Ireland money at <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> it could afford.|$|E
50|$|For example, <b>a</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> of 6% {{compounded}} monthly {{is equivalent}} to <b>an</b> effective <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> of 6.17%. 6% compounded monthly is credited as 6%/12 = 0.005 every month. After one year, the initial capital is increased by the factor (1 + 0.005)12 ≈ 1.0617.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity is here revisited, {{emphasizing}} the different {{results that are}} obtained when the analysis is made either using <b>a</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> difference, adjusted by the actual or expected rate of depreciation, or using <b>a</b> real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> difference. The results vary according to deviations from purchasing power parity. ...|$|R
50|$|To {{approximate}} {{how long}} it takes for money to double at <b>a</b> given <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> i.e. for accumulated compound interest to reach or exceed the initial deposit, divide 72 by the percentage <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> For example, compounding at <b>an</b> annual <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> of 6 percent, it will take 72/6 = 12 years for the money to double.|$|R
25|$|In the United States, as of 2006, the Federal Reserve sets <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{target for}} the Federal funds (overnight bank reserves) market. When the actual Federal funds rate {{is higher than the}} target, the New York Reserve Bank will usually {{increase}} the money supply via a repo (effectively borrowing from the dealers' perspective; lending for the Reserve Bank). When the actual Federal funds rate is less than the target, the Bank will usually decrease the money supply via a reverse repo (effectively lending from the dealers' perspective; borrowing for the Reserve Bank).|$|E
25|$|Asian Development Bank tributes gradual {{growth in}} economy to the {{continued}} low prices for oil and other commodities, the expected pick-up in growth in the advanced economies, and some alleviation of power shortages. However, the sovereign debt of Pakistan has increased dramatically, with total debts and liabilities swelled to Rs. 22.5trillion (or $73billion) by August 2016. Sharif administration also issued a five-year $500-million Eurobond in 2015 at the interest rate of 8.25% and in September 2016, it also raised $1billion by floating Sukuk (Islamic bonds) at <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> of 5.5%.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used sukuk structures replicate the cash flows of conventional bonds. Such structures are listed on exchanges, commonly the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and London Stock Exchange in Europe, and made tradable through conventional organisations like Euroclear or Clearstream. A key technique to achieve capital protection without amounting to a loan is a binding promise to repurchase certain assets; e.g. {{in the case of}} Sukuk Al Ijara, by the issuer. In the meantime a rent is being paid, which is often benchmarked to <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> (LIBOR is the most common though its use is criticized by some Sharia Scholars).|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> lower <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> environment, which {{encourages}} lending and borrowing.|$|R
50|$|However, not all borrowers and lenders {{have access}} to the same <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> even if they are subject to the same inflation. Furthermore, {{expectations}} of future inflation vary, so <b>a</b> forward-looking <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> cannot depend on <b>a</b> single real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> plus <b>a</b> single expected rate of inflation.|$|R
25|$|Ground broke on the Rose Garden in 1993, and the {{building}} opened two years later in 1995. The Rose Garden cost $262 million to build, $155 million of which was financed through a loan from a consortium of lenders led by pension fund TIAA-CREF. As Allen was unwilling to personally guarantee the loan, the lenders demanded <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> of 8.99%, with no opportunity for prepayment. Other major creditors included Prudential Insurance, and Farmers Insurance. A shell corporation, the Oregon Arena Corporation (OAC), was chartered to oversee the construction and operation of the Rose Garden, as well as operation of the Rose Quarter as a whole. The sole shareholder in OAC was Allen.|$|E
25|$|Because banks hold {{reserves}} in amounts {{that are less}} than the amounts of their deposit liabilities, and because the deposit liabilities are considered money in their own right, fractional-reserve banking permits the money supply to grow beyond {{the amount of the}} underlying base money originally created by the central bank. In most countries, the central bank (or other monetary authority) regulates bank credit creation, imposing reserve requirements and capital adequacy ratios. This can slow down the process of money creation that occurs in the commercial banking system, and helps to ensure that banks are solvent and have enough funds to meet demand for withdrawals. However, rather than directly controlling the money supply, central banks usually pursue <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> target to adjust the rate of inflation and bank issuance of credit.|$|E
25|$|The main number {{which is}} used to assess the value of the bond is the gross {{redemption}} yield. This is defined such that if all future interest and principal repayments are discounted back to the present, at <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> equal to the gross redemption yield (gross means pre-tax), then the discounted value is equal to the current market price of the bond (or the initial issue price if the bond is just being launched). Fixed income investments such as bonds and loans are generally priced as a credit spread above a low-risk reference rate, such as LIBOR or U.S. or German Government Bonds of the same duration. For example, if a 30-year mortgage denominated in US dollars has a gross redemption yield of 5% per annum and 30 year US Treasury Bonds have a gross redemption yield of 3% per annum (referred to as the risk free yield), the credit spread is 2% per annum (sometimes quoted as 200 basis points). The credit spread reflects the risk of default. Risk free interest rates are determined by market forces and vary over time, based on a variety of factors, such as current short-term interest rates, e.g. base rates set by central banks such as the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England in the UK, and the Euro Zone ECB. If the coupon on the bond is lower than the yield, then its price will be below the par value, and vice versa.|$|E
