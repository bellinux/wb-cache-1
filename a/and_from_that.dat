5|$|Canberra Airport {{provides}} direct {{domestic services}} to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Gold Coast and Perth, with connections to other domestic centres. There are also direct flights to small regional towns: Dubbo and Newcastle in New South Wales. Regular commercial international flights operate to Singapore and Wellington {{from the airport}} four times a week. Canberra Airport is, as of September 2013, designated by the Australian Government Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development as a restricted use designated international airport. Until 2003 the civilian airport shared runways with RAAF Base Fairbairn. In June of that year, the Air Force base was decommissioned <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> time the airport was fully under civilian control.|$|E

5|$|Jewish civil {{servants}} {{lost their jobs}} in 1933, except {{for those who had}} seen military service in World War I. Members of the NSDAP or party supporters were appointed in their place. As {{part of the process of}} Gleichschaltung, the Reich Local Government Law of 1935 abolished local elections <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> point forward mayors were appointed by the Ministry of the Interior.|$|E

5|$|On 4 July 1932, the Piccadilly {{line was}} {{extended}} west {{from its original}} terminus at Hammersmith and shared the route with the District line to Ealing Common. From Ealing Common to South Harrow, the District line {{was replaced by the}} Piccadilly line, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> date, District line trains from Acton Town ran only either to Hounslow West or to Ealing Broadway. On 9 January 1933 Piccadilly line trains, sharing with the District line, began serving Northfields on the Hounslow branch, and their service was extended to Hounslow West on 13 March 1933 but Piccadilly line trains did not call at South Ealing until 1935. District line services on the Hounslow branch were withdrawn on 9 and 10 October 1964 after which operations were provided by the Piccadilly line alone.|$|E
5|$|The 1938–39 NHL season saw the NHL {{move back}} to a single division, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> point on the Cup was awarded to the playoff runner-up. The Cup was not {{formally}} awarded from 1939 to 1943 {{and it would not}} be until 1944 that the winning teams from that period were inscribed on the trophy. At the end of the 1949–50 NHL season the trophy was retired and has not been awarded since. It is now {{in the collection of the}} Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Ontario and is on display with other historic trophies in the entrance to the Panasonic Hometown Hockey exhibit.|$|E
5|$|The Borough of Shrewsbury's first Charter {{was granted}} by King Henry I {{allowing}} {{the collection of}} rents. King Richard I granted another early charter in 1189 <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> time the town's regional importance and influence increased, {{as well as its}} autonomy from the county of Shropshire. Further charters were granted in 1199 (King John), 1495 (Henry VII), 1638 (Charles I) and 1685 (James II). In 1974 a charter from the Queen incorporated the Borough of Shrewsbury and Atcham, under the auspices of which the town remained until 2009.|$|E

5|$|The {{cover was}} created by graphic artist Margo Nahas. It was not {{specifically}} commissioned; Nahas {{had been asked to}} create a cover that featured four chrome women dancing, but declined due to the creative difficulties. Her husband brought her portfolio to the band anyway, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> material they chose the painting of a putto stealing cigarettes that was used. The model was Carter Helm, who was the child of one of Nahas' best friends, whom she photographed holding a candy cigarette.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{complexion}} of the American {{effort was}} altered on 8 March 1965, when 3,500 U.S. Marines came ashore at Da Nang, ostensibly {{to defend the}} southern airfields committed to prosecuting Rolling Thunder. The mission of the ground forces was expanded to combat operations <b>and,</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> point onward, the aerial campaign became a secondary operation, overwhelmed by troop deployments and the escalation of ground operations in South Vietnam. Until {{the third week of}} April, Rolling Thunder had enjoyed at least equal status with air missions conducted in the south. After that time, strikes that interfered with requirements for the southern battlefield were either cut back or cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Two months later, on August 5, 2000, at the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, Judah {{defeated}} former IBF Light Welterweight Champion Terron Millett by fourth-round knockout. Judah {{was knocked}} {{down in the}} first round from a left hand. Judah rose quickly, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> point on he dominated the fight. Judah hurt Millett with two combinations {{near the end of the}} first round. In round two, Judah sent Millett down with a right hand to the chin. Millett survived the round, but he was clearly hurt. In round four, Judah charged across the ring and inflicted a series of blows on Millett, knocking him down again. Millett got up, but Judah continued his assault and knocked Millett down again. Millett rose at the count of four, but his legs were unsteady and the referee decided to stop the bout.|$|E

5|$|Each {{station was}} {{built as a}} one-storey {{building}} around a square courtyard. The side adjacent to the railway line was left open, and wings extended from the building along the platform on each side. Other than the brick platform faces, chimneys and foundations, the stations were built entirely of wood. Each station held first class and ordinary reception rooms for mourners, a first class and an ordinary refreshment room, {{and a set of}} apartments for LNC staff. The refreshment rooms at both stations were licensed (permitted to sell alcohol). The train crews would generally wait in these refreshment rooms until the trains were ready to return to London, and on at least one occasion (on 12 January 1867) the driver became so drunk that the fireman had to drive the train back to London. This incident prompted a complaint from the LSWR <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> time the LNC provided the train crew with a free lunch, provided they drank no more than one pint of beer.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} Mongolian {{script was}} adapted from Uyghur script probably {{at the very beginning}} of the 13th century <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> time underwent some minor disambiguations and supplementations. Between 1930 and 1932, a short-lived attempt was made to introduce the Latin script in the Mongolian state, and after a preparatory phase, the Mongolian Cyrillic script was declared mandatory by government decree. It has been argued that the 1941 introduction of the Cyrillic script, with its smaller discrepancy between written and spoken form, contributed to the success of the large-scale government literacy campaign, which increased the literacy rate from 17.3% to 73.5% between 1941 and 1950. Earlier government campaigns to eradicate illiteracy, employing the traditional script, had only managed to raise literacy from 3.0% to 17.3% between 1921 and 1940. From 1991 to 1994, an attempt at reintroducing the traditional alphabet failed in the face of popular resistance. In informal contexts of electronic text production, the use of the Latin alphabet is common.|$|E
