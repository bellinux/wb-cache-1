5|$|The World Creole Music Festival {{takes place}} {{on the island of}} Dominica, in Festival City, Roseau, which is run by the {{governmental}} Dominica Festivals Commission. The National Independence Competitions {{are an important part of}} Dominican musical culture. They were founded by Chief Minister of Dominica Edward Olivier Leblanc in 1965, and promote the traditional music and dance of Dominica. The government of Dominica also promotes Dominican music through the Dominican Broadcasting Station, which broadcasts between 20% and 25% local music as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} was organized along similar {{lines to the}} British and American {{armed forces of the}} time, in which a small standing army could quickly augment its strength during emergencies from a reserve militia force (in Brazil, the National Guard). Brazil's first line of defense relied upon a large and powerful navy to protect against foreign attack. As <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy,</b> the {{military was}} to be completely obedient to civilian governmental control and to remain at arm's length from involvement in political decisions.|$|E
25|$|Since the mid-2000s, the United States {{has been}} {{carrying}} out targeted killings of jihadist militants and ideologues in Yemen, although the U.S. government generally does not confirm involvement in specific attacks conducted by unmanned aerial vehicles as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Canada {{a policy}} jury or citizen jury {{is a body}} of people convened to render a {{decision}} or advice on <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> public <b>policy.</b> It is similar to juries used in modern court trial except that the subject of its deliberation is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> public <b>policy,</b> rather than law. The concept <b>of</b> the <b>policy</b> jury is closely connected with deliberative democracy or participatory models of democratic governance, and {{is similar to a}} deliberative opinion poll.|$|R
50|$|Yes. Public policy {{dictates}} that certain waivers are void as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> public <b>policy</b> if {{they relate to}} the public interest.|$|R

25|$|In 2014, Amnesty {{released}} a report with similar findings, criticizing Israel for excessive and reckless use of force for which Israeli soldiers are not held accountable. Amnesty said characteristics of the violence suggested it was employed as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy,</b> {{and that there was}} evidence some killings amounted to war crimes.|$|E
25|$|This {{cannot be}} over-emphasized—the Australian {{government}} literally kidnapped these {{children from their}} parents as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy.</b> White welfare officers, often supported by police, would descend on Aboriginal camps, round up all the children, separate the ones with light-coloured skin, bundle them into trucks and take them away. If their parents protested they were held at bay by police.|$|E
25|$|After over 50 {{years of}} control, Japan's center-right {{conservative}} party, Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), lost in 2009 elections to the opposing left, Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). Environmental organizations had hoped {{the change in}} government would bring about an end to Japanese whaling. However, in 2009 the Foreign Minister of Japan, Katsuya Okada, explained that whaling would continue to receive support as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E

25|$|Religious {{freedom is}} {{virtually}} non-existent. The Government {{does not provide}} legal recognition or protection for freedom of religion, and it is severely restricted in practice. As <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy,</b> the Government guarantees and protects the right to private worship for all, including non-Muslims who gather in homes for religious practice; however, this right is not always respected in practice and is not defined in law.|$|E
25|$|In the dry {{summer of}} 1959, after a poor start by Hilton, Greenhough was {{preferred}} as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy.</b> and Hilton returned to League cricket and the Second Eleven. In 1960, he was jointly awarded a benefit with Tattersall, neither {{playing in the}} benefit match. His last appearance was in 1961 at Edgbaston against Warwickshire during a brief recall. He scored 22 and 2, but was heavily punished by Ray Hitchcock during the first innings when he bowled four overs for 26 runs.|$|E
25|$|Although short-lived, one of {{the first}} empires known to history was that of Eannatum of Lagash, who annexed {{practically}} all of Sumer, including Kish, Uruk, Ur, and Larsa, and reduced to tribute the city-state of Umma, arch-rival of Lagash. In addition, his realm extended to parts of Elam and along the Persian Gulf. He seems to have used terror as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy.</b> Eannatum's Stele of the Vultures depicts vultures pecking at the severed heads and other body parts of his enemies. His empire collapsed shortly after his death.|$|E
5000|$|Ireland's {{neutrality}} is {{in general}} <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> government <b>policy</b> {{rather than a}} requirement of statute law. One exception is Article 29, section 4, subsection 9° of the Constitution: ...|$|R

25|$|Some of {{the family}} members of Vangaru Thirumalai {{established}} the Nayak dynasty in Sri Lanka known as the Kandy Nayaks. They ruled till 1815 with Kandy as their capital and were also the last ruling dynasty of Sri Lanka. The Kings of Kandy had from an early time sought and procured their wives from Madurai. The Kandy Nayaks received military support from the Nayaks of Madurai in fighting off the Portuguese. And in the 17th and 18th centuries, marital alliances between the Kandyan kings and Nayak princesses had become <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{party that}} is aggrieved by a {{decision}} of the NLRB can seek review by petitioning in the Court of Appeals. The Act gives parties {{a good deal of}} latitude as to which court they want to hear their case: either the Circuit in which the hearing was held or the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or any Circuit in which one of the parties against whom the complaint was brought resides or does business. The NLRB, as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy,</b> only petitions in the Circuit in which the hearing was held.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategy}} of the German colonial forces, led by Lieutenant Colonel (later Generalmajor) Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, was to divert Allied forces from the Western Front to Africa. His strategy achieved only mixed results after 1916, when he was driven out of German East Africa and Allied forces became composed almost entirely of South African, Indian and other colonial troops. Black South African troops were not considered for European service as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy,</b> while all Indian units had been withdrawn from the Western Front {{by the end of}} 1915; the campaign in Africa consumed considerable amounts of money and war material that could have gone to other fronts.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{separate}} ingredients of the hamburgers are kosher, {{not all of}} the Burgeranch restaurants are certified as kosher. Burgeranch does not sell cheeseburgers, non-kosher meats (such as bacon) or seafood, as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> franchise <b>policy.</b>|$|R
25|$|LaMountain, {{from his}} {{position}} at Fort Monroe, {{had the luxury of}} flying free. When he was enjoined with the Balloon Corps, he began insisting that his reconnaissance flights be made free. Lowe strictly instructed his men against free flight as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> and procedure. Eventually the two men agreed to a showdown in which LaMountain made one of his free flights. The flight was a success as a reconnaissance flight with LaMountain being able to go where he would. But on his return he was threatened by Union troops who could not identify him. His balloon was shot down, and LaMountain was treated harshly until he was clearly identified.|$|E
25|$|Ambassador Goldberg briefed King Hussein on US assurances {{regarding}} territorial integrity. Goldberg {{said the}} US did not view Jordan {{as a country}} that consisted only of the East Bank, and that the US was prepared to support a return of the West Bank to Jordan with minor boundary rectifications. The US would use its influence to obtain compensation to Jordan for any territory it {{would be required to}} give up. Finally, although as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> the US did not agree with Jordan's position on Jerusalem, nor with the Israeli position on Jerusalem, the US was prepared to use its influence to obtain for Jordan a role in Jerusalem. Secretary Rusk advised President Johnson that he confirmed Goldberg's pledge regarding territorial integrity to King Hussein.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of Lester Pearson and the Liberal Party in the 1963 federal election, and through the {{successive}} governments of Pierre Trudeau, the federal cabinet commuted all death sentences as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy.</b> Hence, the de facto abolition {{of the death penalty}} in Canada occurred in 1963. On November 30, 1967, Bill C-168 was passed creating a five-year moratorium {{on the use of the}} death penalty, except for murders of police and corrections officers. On January 26, 1973, after the expiration of the five-year experiment, the Solicitor General of Canada continued the partial ban on capital punishment, which would eventually lead to the abolition of capital punishment. On July 14, 1976, Bill C-84 was passed by a narrow margin of 130:124 in a free vote, resulting in the de jure abolition of the death penalty, except for certain offences under the National Defence Act. These were removed in 1998.|$|E

25|$|The Polish {{civilian}} population suffered under German occupation in several ways. Large numbers were expelled from land intended for German colonisation, {{and forced to}} resettle in the General-Government area. Hundreds of thousands of Poles were deported to Germany for forced labour in industry and agriculture, where many thousands died. Poles were also conscripted for labour in Poland, and were held in labour camps all over the country, again with a high death rate. There was a general shortage of food, fuel for heating and medical supplies, {{and there was a}} high death rate among the Polish population as a result. Finally, thousands of Poles were killed as reprisals for resistance attacks on German forces or for other reasons. In all, about 3 million (non-Jewish) Poles {{died as a result of}} the German occupation, more than 10% of the pre-war population. When this is added to the 3 million Polish Jews who were killed as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> by the Germans, Poland lost about 22% of its population, the highest proportion of any European country in World War II.|$|E
25|$|The Republic of Texas era {{with the}} Indians {{can be divided}} into three phases: the {{diplomacy}} of Houston during his first term, the hostility of Lamar, and the resumed diplomatic efforts of Houston's second term. Sam Houston led the Republic to negotiate with the Comanche. They said they would stop raiding if they were given sufficient amounts of what they considered prerequisites for peaceful relations: gifts, trade, and regular face-to-face diplomacy. Houston, who enjoyed a good reputation among Indians, had married a mixed-race woman of Cherokee descent. He had lived in Indian Territory for years and learned about their cultures. He was willing to meet with the Comanche on their terms and believed, as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy,</b> that it was worth it to buy a few thousand dollars worth of presents. The Republic could not support the huge cost of a standing army for defense, and it {{might not be able to}} defeat the assembled might of the entire Comanche-Kiowa alliance, especially if they received Mexican help.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish crown at {{the time}} ruled through a system of royal councils. The most {{significant}} of these were the Councils of State and its subordinate Council for War, that were in turn supported by the seven professional councils for the different regions, and four specialised councils for the Inquisition, the Military Orders, Finance and the Crusade tax. These councils were then supplemented by small committees, or juntas, as necessary, such as the 'junta of the night' through which Philip II exercised personal authority {{towards the end of}} his reign. As <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy,</b> Philip had tried to avoid appointing grandees to major positions of power within his government and relied heavily on the lesser nobles, the so-called 'service' nobility. Philip II had taken the traditional system of councils and applied a high degree of personal scrutiny to them, especially in matters of paperwork, which he declined to delegate – the result was a 'ponderous' process. To his contemporaries, the degree of personal oversight he exercised was excessive; his 'self-imposed role as the chief clerk to the Spanish empire' was not thought entirely appropriate. Philip first started to become engaged in practical government at the age of 15, when he joined Philip II's private committee.|$|E
