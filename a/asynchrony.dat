5|$|Although figs flower asynchronously as a population, in {{most species}} {{flowering}} is synchronised within an individual. Newly emerged female wasps must {{move away from}} their natal tree {{in order to find}} figs in which to lay their eggs. This is to the advantage of the fig, since it prevents self-pollination. In Florida, individual F. aurea trees flower and fruit asynchronously. Within-tree <b>asynchrony</b> in flowering is likely to raise the probability of self-pollination, but it may be an adaptation that allows the species to maintain an adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.|$|E

25|$|Hemispheric <b>asynchrony</b> in {{ice sheet}} {{behavior}} {{has been observed}} by linking short-term spikes of methane in Greenland ice cores and Antarctic ice cores. During Dansgaard–Oeschger events, the northern hemisphere warmed considerably, dramatically increasing the release of methane from wetlands, that were otherwise tundra during glacial times. This methane quickly distributes evenly across the globe, becoming incorporated in Antarctic and Greenland ice. With this tie, paleoclimatologists {{have been able to}} say that the ice sheets on Greenland only began to warm after the Antarctic ice sheet had been warming for several thousand years. Why this pattern occurs is still open for debate.|$|E
30|$|Patient-ventilator <b>asynchronies</b> {{were rare}} in the {{population}} studied. None of the patients studied had an AI of 10 % or more. With such a low rate of <b>asynchronies,</b> a superiority of one ventilator mode with regard to patient-ventilator interaction would not be apparent. The low rate of <b>asynchronies</b> {{can be explained by}} the small patient population and the relative short study period. The incidence of ineffective efforts varies over time in the same patient [47]. In addition, it has been observed that <b>asynchronies</b> tend to occur in clusters, between often prolonged uneventful periods [48]. Finally, only one patient had COPD while the median VT in studied modes was low. COPD and high levels of pressure support and VT are factors that further increase the incidence of major <b>asynchronies,</b> notably ineffective efforts [49].|$|R
40|$|Musical meters vary {{considerably}} across cultures, yet relatively {{little is known}} about how culture-specific experience influences metrical processing. In Experiment 1, we compared American and Indian listeners 2 ̆ 7 synchronous tapping to slow sequences. Inter-tone intervals contained silence or to-be-ignored rhythms that were designed to induce a simple meter (familiar to Americans and Indians) or a complex meter (familiar only to Indians). A subset of trials contained an abrupt switch from one rhythm to another to assess the disruptive effects of contradicting the initially implied meter. In the unfilled condition, both groups tapped earlier than the target and showed large tap-tone <b>asynchronies</b> (measured in relative phase). When inter-tone intervals were filled with simple-meter rhythms, American listeners tapped later than targets, but their <b>asynchronies</b> were smaller and declined more rapidly. Likewise, <b>asynchronies</b> rose sharply following a switch away from simple-meter but not from complex-meter rhythm. By contrast, Indian listeners performed similarly across all rhythm types, with <b>asynchronies</b> rapidly declining over the course of complex- and simple-meter trials. For these listeners, a switch from either simple or complex meter increased <b>asynchronies.</b> Experiment 2 tested American listeners but doubled the duration of the synchronization phase prior to (and after) the switch. Here, compared with simple meters, complex-meter rhythms elicited larger <b>asynchronies</b> that declined at a slower rate, however, <b>asynchronies</b> increased after the switch for all conditions. Our results provide evidence that ease of meter processing depends to a great extent on the amount of experience with specific meters...|$|R
30|$|Discrepancies in {{ventilatory}} settings {{were found}} in 55 (34.4) patients. 23 (42) patients had frequent patient–ventilator interactions. Ineffective efforts and double triggering were the two most common <b>asynchronies</b> (43.4 and 13.1 % respectively). Patient–ventilator interactions were assessed as severe in 9 (16.3). Patient-ventilator <b>asynchronies</b> were associated neither to the severity (SPAS II, PaO 2 /FiO 2) nor to the respiratory system mechanic (peak inspiratory pressure, autoPEEP, plateau pressure and driving pressure). A simple intervention on the ventilatory settings corrected the <b>asynchronies</b> in all the patients.|$|R
25|$|In all, {{the short}} SOA (Stimuli Onset <b>Asynchrony,</b> i.e. the time delay between {{the onset of}} the mask and the prime) {{associated}} with the masking make the masked priming paradigm a good tool to investigate automatic and irrepressive activations during visual word recognition. Forster has argued that masked priming is a purer form of priming, as any conscious appreciation {{of the relationship between the}} prime and the target is effectively eliminated, and thus removes the subject's ability to use the prime strategically to make decisions. Results from numerous experiments show that certain forms of priming occur that are very difficult to occur with visible primes. One such example is form-priming, where the prime is similar to, but not identical to the target (e.g., nature-mature).|$|E
2500|$|Responses to {{multiple}} simultaneous sensory stimuli can be faster than {{responses to the}} same stimuli presented in isolation. Hershenson (1962) presented a light and tone simultaneously and separately, and asked human participants to respond {{as rapidly as possible}} to them. As the <b>asynchrony</b> between the onsets of both stimuli was varied, it was observed that for certain degrees of <b>asynchrony,</b> reaction times were decreased. These levels of <b>asynchrony</b> were quite small, perhaps reflecting the temporal window that exists in multisensory neurons of the SC. Further studies have analysed the reaction times of saccadic eye movements; and more recently correlated these findings to neural phenomena.

2500|$|To {{achieve the}} high {{performance}} needed for mathematically intensive tasks, such as decoding/encoding MPEG streams, generating or transforming three-dimensional data, or undertaking Fourier analysis of data, the Cell processor marries the SPEs and the PPE via EIB to give access, via fully cache coherent DMA (direct memory access), to both main memory {{and to other}} external data storage. To {{make the best of}} EIB, and to overlap computation and data transfer, each of the nine processing elements (PPE and SPEs) is equipped with a DMA engine. [...] Since the SPE's load/store instructions can only access its own local scratchpad memory, each SPE entirely depends on DMAs to transfer data to and from the main memory and other SPEs' local memories. A DMA operation can transfer either a single block area of size up to 16KB, or a list of 2 to 2048 such blocks. One of the major design decisions in the architecture of Cell is the use of DMAs as a central means of intra-chip data transfer, with a view to enabling maximal <b>asynchrony</b> and concurrency in data processing inside a chip.|$|E
30|$|Introduction: Noninvasive {{ventilation}} (NIV) {{in intensive}} care (ICU) {{is associated with the}} occurrence of frequent <b>asynchronies</b> related to the leaks around the interface, mainly auto-triggering and delayed cycling. Their detection requires a respiratory muscles activity monitoring. Diaphragmatic ultrasonography is a simple imaging technique available at bedside to assess diaphragm motion. Whether diaphragmatic ultrasonography would allow detecting <b>asynchronies</b> due to leaks during NIV is unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess two methods of diaphragmatic ultrasonography (excursion and thickening), coupled with the airway pressure signal to detect patient-ventilator <b>asynchronies</b> during NIV.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the effects of cervical spine adjustments on sensorimotor synchronisation. Methods: This was an unblinded, controlled experimental study using a pre-post test design, which included thirty participants who were randomly divided into two groups of fifteen. All thirty participants performed a series of finger tapping tasks, which was used as measurements for objective data. Group One had five consultations over approximately 14 days: During their first and fifth visit, participants performed a series of finger tapping tasks and then received chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy to restricted cervical spine segments (as determined by the researcher). After their treatment, participants repeated the tapping tasks. During their second, third and forth visits, participants in Group One only received treatment and no tapping tasks were done during these consultations. Group Two only had two consultations, which were approximately 14 days apart. During these consultations, participants performed the tapping tasks, took a five-minute break and repeated them. Tapping tasks were recorded on an iOS application called TapIt. The time signatures that were recorded were imported into a spreadsheet where the means and standard deviations of <b>asynchronies</b> and intertap intervals were calculated. Results: The results showed that there were statistically significant changes in the accuracy and variability of finger tapping tasks in both groups. In the immediate effects, both Group One and Two showed larger negative mean <b>asynchronies</b> with only participants in Group One showing an increase in variability of <b>asynchronies.</b> Only Group Two showed statistically significant changes in intertap intervals. In the longterm effects, Group One showed a statistically significant decrease in negative mean <b>asynchronies</b> indicating an improvement in accuracy of taps. Both groups showed statistically significant decreases in variability of <b>asynchronies,</b> with Group One showing a slightly larger reduction thereof. Conclusion: Participants that received treatment intervention demonstrated larger negative mean <b>asynchronies</b> immediately following chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy. This may have been due to altered neural processing of incoming sensory information and/or altered sensorimotor integration, which resulted in faster execution of motor movements involved in finger tapping tasks. The treatment group also demonstrated a reduction in negative mean <b>asynchronies</b> after several treatments. Both groups showed reductions in variability of <b>asynchronies</b> over time. However, the treatment group showed slightly larger reductions in variability after several treatments compared to participants who did not receive any treatment intervention. M. Tech.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has revealed {{the existence of}} perceptual mechanisms that compensate for slight temporal <b>asynchronies</b> between auditory and visual signals. We investigated whether temporal recalibration would also occur between auditory and tactile stimuli. Participants were exposed to streams of brief auditory and tactile stimuli presented in synchrony, or else with the auditory stimulus leading by 75 ms. After the exposure phase, the participants made temporal order judgments regarding pairs of auditory and tactile events occurring at varying stimulus onset <b>asynchronies.</b> The {{results showed that the}} minimal interval necessary to correctly resolve audiotactile temporal order was larger after exposure to the desynchronized streams than after exposure to the synchronous streams. This suggests the existence of a mechanism to compensate for audiotactile <b>asynchronies</b> that results in a widening of the temporal window for multisensory integration...|$|R
2500|$|Indirect human {{disturbance}} {{may also}} be a threat. While some populations tolerate small boats, most actively try to avoid ships. Whale-watching has become a booming activity in the St. Lawrence and Churchill River areas, and acoustic contamination from this activity appears to have an effect on belugas. For example, [...] a correlation appears to exist between the passage of belugas across the mouth of the Saguenay River, which has decreased by 60%, and the increase in the use of recreational motorboats in the area. A dramatic decrease has also been recorded in the number of calls between animals (decreasing from 3.4 to 10.5 calls/min to 0 or <1) after exposure to the noise produced by ships, the effect being most persistent and pronounced with larger ships such as ferries than with smaller boats. Belugas can detect the presence of large ships (for example icebreakers) up to 50nbsp&km away, and they move rapidly in the opposite direction or perpendicular to the ship following the edge of the sea ice for distances of up to 80nbsp&km to avoid them. The presence of shipping produces avoidance behaviour, causing deeper dives for feeding, the break-up of groups, and <b>asynchrony</b> in dives.|$|E
2500|$|Stimuli in Stroop {{paradigms}} can {{be divided}} into 3 groups: neutral, congruent and incongruent. Neutral stimuli are those stimuli in which only the text (similarly to stimuli 1 of Stroop's experiment), or color (similarly to stimuli 3 of Stroop's experiment) are displayed. Congruent stimuli are those in which the ink color and the word refer to the same color (for example the word [...] "pink" [...] written in pink). Incongruent stimuli are those in which ink color and word differ. Three experimental findings are recurrently found in Stroop experiments. A first finding is semantic interference, which states that naming the ink color of neutral stimuli (e.g. when the ink color and word do not interfere with each other) is faster than in incongruent conditions. It is called semantic interference since it is usually accepted that the relationship in meaning between ink color and word {{is at the root of}} the interference. The second finding, semantic facilitation, explains the finding that naming the ink of congruent stimuli is faster (e.g. when the ink color and the word match) than when neutral stimuli are present (e.g. stimulus 3; when only a coloured square is shown). The third finding is that both semantic interference and facilitation disappear when the task consists of reading the word instead of naming the ink. It has been sometimes called Stroop <b>asynchrony,</b> and has been explained by a reduced automatization when naming colors compared to reading words.|$|E

Temporal accuracy of performance was compared with finger trajectories recorded with motion capture. <b>Asynchronies</b> were larger when motor or auditory sensory information occurred between beats; auditory information yielded the largest <b>asynchronies.</b> Pianists were sensitive to {{the timing of the}} sensory information; information that occurred earlier relative to the midpoint between metronome beats was associated with larger <b>asynchronies</b> on the following beat. Finger motion was influenced only by motor production between beats and indicated the influence of other fingers' motion.

40|$|We review studies {{suggesting}} time disorders on both {{automatic and}} subjective levels {{in patients with}} schizophrenia. Patients have difficulty explicitly discriminating between simultaneous and asynchronous events, and ordering events in time. We discuss {{the relationship between these}} difficulties and impairments on a more elementary level. We showed that for undetectable stimulus onset <b>asynchronies</b> below 20  ms, neither patients nor controls merge events in time, as previously believed. On the contrary, subjects implicitly distinguish between events even when evaluating them to be simultaneous. Furthermore, controls privilege the last stimulus, whereas patients seem to stay stuck on the first stimulus when <b>asynchronies</b> are sub-threshold. Combining previous results shows this to be true for patients even for <b>asynchronies</b> as short as 8  ms. Moreover, this peculiarity predicts difficulties with detecting <b>asynchronies</b> longer than 50  ms, suggesting an impact on the conscious ability to time events. Difficulties on the subjective level are also correlated with clinical disorganization. The results are interpreted within the framework of predictive coding which can account for an implicit ability to update events. These results complement a range of other results, by suggesting a difficulty with binding information in time as well as space, and by showing that information processing lacks continuity and stability in patients. The time perspective may help bridge the gap between cognitive impairments and clinical symptoms, by showing how the innermost structure of thought and experience is disrupted...|$|R
40|$|This author {{accepted}} manuscript {{is under}} an indefinite embargo. It is pending publication by the Royal Northern College of Music. Many musicians performing an ensemble work would aim to achieve good, if not perfect, synchronisation of timing {{for the sake}} of an effective rendition (McCaleb, 2014). In this respect, Pau Casals’ and Mieczysław Horszowski’s 1935 recording of the second movement of Johannes Brahms’s F major Cello Sonata, Op. 99, is certainly intriguing, as <b>asynchronies</b> between the two instruments are clearly perceptible throughout extensive passages. Questions concerning the rationale behind these temporal discrepancies arise: To what extent were Casals and Horszowski intending not to play together? In what ways can we understand these <b>asynchronies?</b> What are their musical effects? 	 Analysis of timing issues that focused on the magnitude of the <b>asynchronies</b> as well as on tempo curves and durational patterns employed by the performers in this recording has shed light on the effects, purpose, and meaning of those <b>asynchronies.</b> This article illustrates that the temporal discrepancies between the cello and piano parts are neither the result of chance nor only local expressive devices; rather, they are critical elements in a highly distinctive construction of the Adagio Affettuoso from Brahms’s Op. 99. They attest to an ongoing structural dialogue between the musicians that shapes and paces the piece in unexpected ways, prompting a reconsideration of ensemble playing as affording different, even conflicting attitudes. Furthermore, their potentially structural import leads to a critical broadening of the methods and parameters that music analysis has traditionally acknowledged. On these bases, a fruitful dialogue between music analysis and performance is put forward. Fundación La Caix...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{sensorimotor}} synchronization {{paradigm is}} used when studying {{the coordination of}} rhythmic motor re-sponses with a pacing stimulus and is an important paradigm {{in the study of}} human timing and time perception. Two mea-sures of performance frequently calculated using sensorimotor synchronization data are the average offset and variability of the stimulus-to-response asynchronies—the offsets between the stimuli and the motor responses. Here it is shown that assuming that <b>asynchronies</b> are normally distributed when es-timating these measures can result in considerable underesti-mation of both the average offset and variability. This is due to a tendency for the distribution of the <b>asynchronies</b> to be bi-modal and left skewed when the interstimulus interval is lon-ger than 2 s. It is argued that (1) this asymmetry {{is the result of the}} distribution of the <b>asynchronies</b> being a mixture of two types of responses—predictive and reactive—and (2) themain interest in a sensorimotor synchronization study is the predic-tive responses. A Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach is proposed in which sensorimotor synchronization data are modeled as coming from a right-censored normal distribution that effectively separates the predictive responses from the reactive responses. Evaluation using both simulated data and experimental data from a study by Repp and Doggett (2007) showed that the proposed approach produces more precise estimates of the average offset and variability, with consider-ably less underestimation...|$|R

Moreover, the stimuli could be either simultaneous or separated by 1 of 3 different <b>asynchronies</b> (105, 505, 905 ms). C subjects were perfect in all conditions. RBD patients omitted the contralesional tactile stimulus in bilateral trials (across space, classical extinction). They also omitted the tactile stimulus in unilateral left trials (within hemispace).
