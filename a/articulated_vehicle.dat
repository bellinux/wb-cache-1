2500|$|The {{system was}} lightweight, with {{stations}} designed for trains {{of only a}} single <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The three branches totalled , had 15 stations, and were connected by a flat triangular junction near [...] Services ran from Tower Gateway to Island Gardens and from Stratford to Island Gardens; {{the north side of}} the junction was used only for access to the depot at Poplar. The stations were mostly of a common design and constructed from standard components. A common feature was a short half-cylindrical glazed blue canopy. All stations were above ground and were generally unstaffed, although later extension included stations below ground which were required by law to be staffed in case of evacuation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{relative}} navigation control strategy {{based on the}} relation space method (RSM) for <b>articulated</b> underground trackless <b>vehicles.</b> In the RSM, a self-organizing, competitive neural network is used to identify the space around the vehicle, and the spatial geometric relationships of the identified space are {{used to determine the}} vehicle’s optimal driving direction. For driving control, the trajectories of the <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicles</b> are analyzed, and data-based steering and speed control modules are developed to reduce modeling complexity. Simulation shows that the proposed RSM can choose the correct directions for <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicles</b> in different tunnels. The effectiveness and feasibility of the resulting novel relative navigation control strategy are validated through experiments...|$|R
