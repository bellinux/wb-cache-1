Prior {{the outbreak of}} war the Australian military possessed <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> intelligence gathering facilities and was reliant on information passed on by the British intelligence services. Several small signals intelligence units were established in 1939 and 1940, which had some success intercepting and deciphering Japanese transmissions before {{the outbreak of the}} Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|Henry allowed Catherine <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> {{political}} influence as queen. Although she sometimes acted as regent during his absences from France, her powers were strictly nominal. Henry gave the Château of Chenonceau, which Catherine had wanted for herself, to Diane de Poitiers, {{who took her}} place at the centre of power, dispensing patronage and accepting favours.|$|E

5|$|Progress {{remained}} slow through 1991 and 1992. A cabinet {{set up in}} October 1991 contained <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> opposition at all, and {{the administrative}} hierarchy across the country only recognised the authority of Habyarimana's MRND party. The regime frequently used violence {{as a tool to}} hamper reform, justifying its actions as anti-RPF security measures.|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court of the United States issued <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> {{constitutional}} {{criminal procedure}} decisions {{for its first}} century of existence. Professor Akhil Amar highlights two reasons for this. First, the Court's decision in Barron v. Baltimore (1833) meant that the federal constitution did not apply in state proceedings until the incorporation of the Bill of Rights after the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, the Court lacked general appellate jurisdiction over federal criminal cases until 1891.|$|E

5|$|This {{language}} was greatly condensed by Congress, {{and passed the}} House and Senate with <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> recorded debate, complicating future discussion of the Amendment's intent.

5|$|With <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> land left {{to develop}} for housing, Teaneck's {{population}} {{is likely to}} remain stable for the foreseeable future. A reluctance to permit high-rise development as a means to increase population density also places a limit on growth.

5|$|A major {{corrective}} opportunity {{this year}} involved the rerelease {{of one of}} the earliest malicious biographies of Mrs. Eddy, The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science by Georgine Milmine. Dating from the yellow journalism period, this book was published in an attempt to discredit her. The current publisher, after much correspondence with our office, instead issued a statement accurately characterizing its bias. The book has received <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> attention in the public, proving if Truth isn't spoken, nothing is said.|$|E
5|$|A recent calm period, with <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> {{earthquake}} or magmatic {{activity at}} Hualālai, {{has seen the}} growth of homes, businesses, and resorts on the mountain's flanks. The most recent major activity at the volcano was in 1929, when an intense earthquake swarm rocked Hualālai, most likely caused by magmatic action near the volcano's peak. Although it has been relatively placid in the recent past, Hualālai is still potentially active, {{and is expected to}} erupt again within the next 100years.|$|E

Small groups were scattered elsewhere, and both Gracias a Dios and Santa María de Comayagua were dangerously vulnerable, with <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> soldiers left there. Seeing {{the vulnerability of the}} Spanish positions across the greater province, Lempira declared a general uprising. The whole region south of the Peñol rose up, as well as neighbouring parts of El Salvador around San Salvador and San Miguel, where they caused serious damage to the Spanish. The Comayagaua Valley joined the revolt, as did the mountain regions around San Pedro, and outlying areas around Trujillo.|$|E

5|$|Although the Coffins {{had little}} money, their life with Alice's upper-class {{relatives}} gave Marian an almost aristocratic upbringing that {{introduced her to}} high society on the East Coast and enabled her to make social connections that were to be extremely valuable in later life.

PedroII had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not allow his ouster to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent {{the last two years of}} his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.|$|E

A protégé of the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius, he witnessed the signing of the Sand River Convention with Britain in 1852 and over the next decade played a prominent role in the forging of the South African Republic, leading its commandos and resolving disputes between the rival Boer leaders and factions. In 1863 he was elected Commandant-General, a post he held for a decade before he resigned soon after the election of President Thomas François Burgers.|$|E
