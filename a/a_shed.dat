5|$|Yue {{lives in}} <b>a</b> <b>shed</b> by his grave {{through the winter}} {{and in the second}} lunar month of the {{following}} year, his martial brothers come and pull the building down, forcing him to return home and take care of his mother.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} February 1962 and cost NOK3.2 million. The runway was {{completed}} {{by the fall of}} that year, but other parts of the construction were delayed. By late April 1963, the airport was lacking fire fighting equipment and ground crew had still not received sufficient training. However, the issues were resolved, allowing the airport to open on schedule on 4 May 1963. Lakselv and Kirkenes Airport also opened the same day, while Tromsø Airport opened the following year. Several important facilities were missing from Alta Airport when it opened; the control tower and the passenger terminal were not completed until 1964, so at first <b>a</b> <b>shed</b> was used as terminal.|$|E
5|$|The Avery Homestead {{is located}} {{on the west side of}} Ledyard, Connecticut and faces south on Avery Hill Road. The house overlooks 100 acres (40.46 hectares) of stone-walled pasture land that extends south to Stoddards Wharf Road. The two-story house has <b>a</b> <b>shed</b> to the {{immediate}} east and a two-story barn to the southeast. Past the barn is a farm pond that is located in a small valley formed by Billings-Avery Brook. The brook extends west for a mile (about 1.6km) before joining the Thames River.|$|E
5000|$|A {{settlement}} developed {{around the}} station. First of all, <b>a</b> coal <b>shed,</b> <b>a</b> goods <b>shed,</b> <b>a</b> water loading point and a workshop were built. An inn {{was built in}} 1842. A brickyard, construction companies and the first residential buildings were added.|$|R
25|$|Other {{structures}} {{include a}} fenced fuel store, <b>a</b> tool <b>shed,</b> <b>a</b> garage/stores <b>shed,</b> and <b>a</b> bulk fuel farm. They are mostly timber-framed and clad with fibro.|$|R
5000|$|The Agriculture area is fondly {{known as}} the [...] "Ag Plot" [...] or the [...] "Farm" [...] and {{consists}} of several small paddocks, an area for growing plants, <b>a</b> machinery <b>shed,</b> <b>a</b> tool <b>shed,</b> <b>a</b> greenhouse and another shed that stores seeds and the like.|$|R
5|$|The {{first book}} in Blyton's Barney Mysteries series, The Rockingdown Mystery, was {{published}} in 1949, as {{was the first of}} her fifteen Secret Seven novels. The Secret Seven Society consists of Peter, his sister Janet, and their friends Colin, George, Jack, Pam and Barbara, who meet regularly in <b>a</b> <b>shed</b> in the garden to discuss peculiar events in their local community. Blyton rewrote the stories so they could be adapted into cartoons, which appeared in Mickey Mouse Weekly in 1951 with illustrations by George Brook. The French author Evelyne Lallemand continued the series in the 1970s, producing an additional twelve books, nine of which were translated into English by Anthea Bell between 1983 and 1987.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} takes a brief detour as Martin and Rustin {{direct their}} attention to a five-year-old missing-persons case, a little girl named Marie Fontenot, after she was mentioned {{by one of the}} locals. Authorities believe she is in the care of her father, and during a visit to see her uncle Danny Fontenot (Christopher Berry), his caretaker echoed their beliefs. Rustin searches the property for potential evidence, and while in <b>a</b> <b>shed,</b> stumbles upon a twig sculpture eerily similar to those discovered at the Dora Lange murder scene.|$|E
5|$|The main barn is {{oriented}} on a north–south axis and has {{a conventional}} bent framing and sheathed with vertical boards. It is believed that {{the addition of a}} cupola with a hip roof may have been a later addition to the barn. Photos dating from 1870 confirm its age, but the date of construction for the barn cannot be determined, but it may date from the 18th century. The former ell of the house was converted in <b>a</b> <b>shed</b> and dates to around 1780.|$|E

50|$|The {{farmstead}} {{also contains}} <b>a</b> packing <b>shed,</b> <b>a</b> garage and corncrib, <b>a</b> blockhouse/tractor <b>shed,</b> two small wood frame houses used by handymen or migrant workers, a granary, pigpen, and several chicken coops.|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} {{facilities}} like 24 dormitories and residences (one chief, nine senior staff, ten junior staff and four lower staff), one guest house, one boys' hostel, one girls' hostel and two mess halls. There is a poultry house, <b>a</b> goat <b>shed,</b> two cattle/buffalo <b>sheds,</b> <b>a</b> swine <b>shed,</b> <b>a</b> farm store, an auditorium hall, a garage and a dispensary.|$|R
5|$|A one-story kitchen addition, {{built in}} 1961–1962 and {{measuring}} about , {{extends from the}} northwest side of the original 1855 house. The addition has a gabled standing seam metal roof, and its exterior is covered in white-painted board-and-batten siding. It has a vinyl bay window on the southwest side, a one-over-one double-hung vinyl window on the northeast side and a door (adjoining {{the wall of the}} 1855 house) on the southeast side. An enclosed board-and-batten porch, measuring about , and <b>a</b> <b>shed</b> roof extend from the front (southwest) of the kitchen addition. The original basement under the 1855 house is accessible through this porch extension. A ghost building outline on the northwest side of the 1855 house indicates an earlier structure where the present kitchen addition stands.|$|E
5|$|After {{peace was}} {{achieved}} with France in 1558, military attention shifted towards the Spanish {{threat to the}} increasingly prosperous south-west side of England. Tensions with Spain grew and invasion appeared likely in 1589, resulting in royal permission being given to reuse the stonework from the East Blockhouse for new coastal defences, but this work was not carried out. The fort continued to decay until the 20th century. With {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War in 1939, the East Blockhouse was adapted for use by the British military. The interior was cleared out and <b>a</b> <b>shed</b> was built in one corner. A slit trench was dug {{on the north side of}} the building, a rifle embrasure formed on the east side of the building, and a machine-gun position was dug out and protected with sandbags outside it.|$|E
5|$|Field {{punishment}} (FP) {{had replaced}} flogging (abolished {{at home in}} 1868 and on active service in 1881, although still used in military prisons until 1907). FP No.1 (in which the man was shackled to fixed object, e.g. a large wheel) was awarded to 60,210 cases, equivalent to one man in 50 (although in practice there were many repeat offenders). FP No.1 could be very unpleasant depending on the weather, was abhorred by some as barbaric, and in some units was ritualised (e.g. by locking a man in <b>a</b> <b>shed</b> and throwing the handcuffs in with him); there were also cases of Australian troops releasing British troops whom they found tied up, although in other units it {{was regarded as a}} necessary sanction for serious offences. FP No.2 meant that a man was shackled but not fixed in place.|$|E
50|$|Black Jack is {{the name}} of <b>a</b> <b>shedding</b> card game which shares its name with the casino card game Blackjack. It is a variant of Crazy Eights.|$|R
5000|$|After this time, {{the museum}} prospered in {{building}} on the site, with <b>an</b> electric traction <b>shed</b> built in 1976, {{as well as the}} Steam Technology building in 1983, <b>a</b> carriage <b>shed</b> in 1984 and a roundhouse in 1986. The most recent additions to the museum include <b>a</b> Fire Services <b>shed</b> completed in 2004, and <b>a</b> Road Transport <b>shed</b> completed in 2013.|$|R
50|$|Eight {{buildings}} and structures compose the McClelland Farm complex: the barn, a silo, the farmhouse, <b>a</b> small square <b>shed,</b> <b>a</b> machinery <b>shed,</b> <b>a</b> chicken coop, a hog house, and a corn crib. Three of these buildings — the house, the barn, and the machinery shed — contribute to the historic nature of the farm, while the remaining structures are unoriginal or have been heavily modified.|$|R
5|$|In 1859, {{three years}} after the first Quaker {{settlers}} arrived in the area, a meeting house was constructed {{on the site of the}} present-day Friends meeting house for US$1,000. Quakers continued to flow into the area through the 1860s and in 1874 the current Friends meeting house was constructed and it has seen little change since it was built. Some minor alterations have taken place, including the addition of a concrete porch to the entryway and <b>a</b> <b>shed</b> on the east (rear) facade. The shed was added around 1910 to serve as a storage space and a privy. The building became a social, political, and religious hub for the area Quakers and the site was visited by Friends from other meeting houses around the state. The building is no longer owned by a religious institution, though there are occasional services held there.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 1900s, the Archville Fire Company was formed in {{neighboring}} Archville, New York, with the company headquarters in <b>a</b> <b>shed</b> on the corner of Albany Post Road (current U.S. Route 9) and Union Street. The company's original equipment consisted of thirty 3½ gallon galvanized buckets, and later a 50-gallon horse-drawn pumper purchased from the Valhalla Fire Department. The company was chartered in 1909 as the Archville Fire Department, with Hubert W. Mannerly as the first fire chief. From then until 1930 the Archville department was autonomous, until Briarcliff Manor requested that Archville provide its fire protection services to Scarborough. In 1930, the Archville department changed its name to the Scarborough Fire Company and became part of the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department, although no contract had been signed and neither party expressed intentions to formalize the arrangement. In 1972, the company was split into two units, with an autonomous Archville unit and the Scarborough Engine Company, headquartered in the Scarborough Presbyterian Church garage and a part of the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department.|$|E
5|$|Qiao Weiyue {{also built}} five double slipways (lit. dams) between Anbei and Huaishi (or, the quays on the Huai waterfront). Each of these had ten lanes for the barges {{to go up}} and down. Their cargoes of {{imperial}} tax-grain were heavy, and as they were passing over they often came to grief and were damaged or wrecked, with loss of the grain and peculation by a cabal of the workers in league with local bandits hidden nearby. Qiao Weiyue therefore first ordered the construction of two gates at the third dam along the West River (near Huaiyin). The distance between the two gates was rather more than 50 paces (250ft) and the whole space was covered over with a great roof like <b>a</b> <b>shed.</b> The gates were 'hanging gates'; (when they were closed) the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached, and then when the time came it was allowed to flow out. He also built a horizontal bridge to protect their foundations. After this was done (to all the double slipways) the previous corruption was completely eliminated, and the passage of the boats went on without the slightest impediment.|$|E
50|$|The listing {{includes}} seven contributing buildings: the Schick/Ostolasa farmhouse, Red House, a root cellar, <b>a</b> wood <b>shed,</b> <b>a</b> saddle barn, a horse barn, and {{a chicken}} house, and <b>a</b> non-contributing utility <b>shed.</b> <b>A</b> community barn built in 1997 {{on the location}} of former lambing sheds {{is not included in}} the listed area. The Schick/Ostolasa Farmhouse was built c.1864-1868, and was extended in 1870 and at other times.|$|R
50|$|Other {{structures}} {{on the farm}} include a log cabin (c. 1850), a log cottage (c. 1850s, altered in 1938), a tenant house (c. 1890), a springhouse (1850s), a garage (1920s), the main barn (c. 1850), <b>a</b> machine <b>shed</b> (c. 1910), <b>a</b> spray <b>shed</b> (c. 1920) and <b>a</b> bull <b>shed</b> (c. 1910) {{as well as a}} cemetery for slaves, active from c. 1776 to 1865.|$|R
50|$|Jammu has <b>a</b> trip <b>shed</b> {{for visiting}} locos where WDS-4 locos {{belonging}} to Shakurbasti shed are retained for long periods. Pathankot Cantonment (Chakki Bank) had <b>a</b> steam <b>shed</b> {{which has now}} been decommissioned.|$|R
5|$|Routine care {{during the}} growing season {{involves}} keeping the rows free of competing weeds, especially when the plants are young. The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need a great deal of water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be kept in storage, they should be harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left {{on the surface of the}} soil for a few days to dry out properly, then they can be placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. They should be stored in a well-ventilated, cool place such as <b>a</b> <b>shed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Master and Mistress buy {{a female}} collie puppy named Lady to be Lad's {{companion}} and mate. Lad becomes her protector and slave, as she bullies {{him from his}} food and {{the best places to}} lie, and endures the flashes of nasty temper that lead her to bite his ears and paws. As she grows older, she becomes a generally well-behaved house dog, but when she is eight months old, she tries to attack a beloved mounted bald eagle belonging to the Master. He whips her and then locks her in <b>a</b> <b>shed</b> for the night as punishment; however, during the night it catches on fire. Lad desperately tries to break down the door to free her, then howls in agony, before jumping through its high window to join Lady inside. The Master, awakened by Lad's howl, arrives in time to free them both, though both have badly burned coats.|$|E
5|$|The jury heard how {{the murder}} weapons {{had been found}} in <b>a</b> <b>shed</b> at Nazir's house along with two bags of bloodied clothes. DNA and {{fingerprints}} belonging to Nazir was found on the hunting knife and Parker's blood was found on both the hammer and knife. His blood was also found on the clothes of two of the accused, along with Nazir and Mahrad's DNA and a pathologist told how marks on Parker's body matched the hammer found in Nazir's shed. Three balaclavas were also recovered from the property, again containing traces of Parker's blood, Nazir's younger brother Wyed told the court he had seen his brother cleaning the murder weapon {{on the night of the}} killing and witnessed all four defendants with blood on their clothing. Further witnesses reported Nazir admitting to beating someone up, Mahrad admitting to kicking Parker and Awan recalling stabbing him. A witness also saw all four defendants kicking Parker.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} things that can cause the warp threads not to {{separate}} cleanly, and thus produce <b>a</b> poor <b>shed.</b> <b>A</b> slack warp, threads set too closely in the reed, or increase of friction on the first foot or so of the warp where the threads were handled all cause poor sheds. Fuzzy yarns like mohair can also cause <b>a</b> poor <b>shed.</b> To get <b>a</b> better <b>shed</b> the weaver can lift the harnesses while the reed is against the fabric, or raise only one harness at a time. By weaving in a different manner sometimes <b>a</b> good <b>shed</b> can be created. The weaver can also insert a stick into the shed to clear it, and make way for the shuttle though this option is time-consuming.|$|R
50|$|Taylor Farm is a {{historic}} farm complex located in Richmond, Virginia. The complex consists of a well-preserved group of buildings and landscape elements ranging in date from the 1870s to the 1930s. they include a small two-story frame main house, a handsome American Craftsman-style garage, <b>a</b> storage <b>shed,</b> <b>a</b> barn, a corncrib, <b>a</b> lumber <b>shed,</b> and <b>a</b> poultry house.|$|R
50|$|The first {{station in}} Eutingen was opened on 1 June 1874 with the {{commissioning}} of the Nagold Valley Railway (Nagoldtalbahn). It lay {{to the southeast}} of the village. The Stuttgart-Hattingen railway {{was connected to the}} north of the station in 1879. The station then consisted of a temporary administration building, <b>a</b> goods <b>shed,</b> <b>a</b> locomotive <b>shed</b> and staff accommodation.|$|R
5|$|The {{panel is}} set in <b>a</b> <b>shed</b> {{enclosed}} by two pillars and an archway, rendered in sculpture-like grisaille. Each pillar {{is supported by a}} relief hunched figure (atlante) at the base, holding the weight on its shoulders. On each pillar stand statues of Adam and Eve– Adam on the left and Eve to the right. A marble threshold connects the two structures. On the top corners of the arch are two spandrels; the archivolts contain six biblical scenes in relief from the Book of Genesis, depicting the Fall of Man. Two are of Adam and Eve; their expulsion from paradise and Adam tilling the soil. The others are of Cain and Abel: their sacrifice to God; Cain slaying Abel; God appearing to Abel; Cain expelled to the Land of Nod.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} {{equipped}} with <b>a</b> <b>shed,</b> but no other amenities, and also lacks a ticket machine. The platform (but not necessarily the train) is wheelchair accessible. There are about ten parking spaces at the station. A shuttle bus corresponds to all trains during the opening hours of the airport, and a bus trip takes four minutes to the airport terminal. The shuttle bus leaves the airport ten minutes before each train's scheduled departure. The bus is operated by NSB, and {{is included in the}} price of the train ticket. There are 42 bus departures each day. The train supplements a coach service, Torp Expressen operated by UniBuss, to Oslo, and a local bus service to Sandefjord, operated by Vestviken Kollektivtrafikk.|$|E
5|$|After {{shooting}} Magruder {{and killing}} Arnaud, Logan then fled {{the scene with}} Kromah in a silver-painted Dodge Charger with Maryland license plates, with Kromah driving the vehicle. After leaving the house, Kromah took the weapon from Logan and attempted to wipe off any residual evidence, such as fingerprints, from it. The two then disposed of the murder weapon by burying it at a nearby forested cemetery and abandoned the getaway vehicle. Kromah was captured and charged as an accomplice to the murder; he pleaded guilty on April 24, 2003 to being an accessory after the fact to a murder. In the meantime, Logan stayed briefly at the residence of Twyla James, a woman who lived in Largo, Maryland. James would later be arrested and charged as an accessory to murder as she transported Logan, whom she had known was a murder suspect and fugitive sought by legal authorities, to her residence and allowed him to stay there. Logan was apprehended {{two days after the}} murder, on August 31, 2002, at <b>a</b> <b>shed</b> near the Quebec Arms Apartments in Hyattsville, Maryland, on the 8200 block of 14th Avenue. He was spotted there by undercover policemen, who had received information that it had been an area that Logan was known to frequent in the past. Logan was found hiding in the shed by policemen, who then used a police canine and a taser to subdue and apprehend him.|$|E
