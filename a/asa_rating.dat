We retrospectively reviewed 1379 consecutive prospectively followed patients with hip fractures treated from January 2000 to May 2006. Of the 1379 patients, 101 (7. 3 %) had poststroke hemiplegia.

40|$|A {{prospective}} randomized trial comparing laparoscopic appendectomy {{with open}} appendectomy {{in patients with}} a diagnosis of acute appendicitis was conducted between October 1992 and April 1991. Of the 158 patients randomized, 7 patients {{were excluded because of}} protocol violations (conversion to laparotomy in 4, appendix not removed in 3). The 151 patients randomized to either a laparoscopic (n = 79) or an open appendectomy (n = 72) showed no difference in sex, age, American Society of Anesthesiology (<b>ASA)</b> <b>rating,</b> or previous abdominal surgery. The histologic classification of normal, catarrhal, inflamed, suppurative, and gangrenous appendicitis was not different between the two groups. Conversion from laparoscopic to open appendectomy was necessary in seven patients (9 %) who had advanced forms of appendiceal inflammation, When compared to open appendectomy the laparoscopic group had a longer median operating time (63 minutes versus 40 minutes), fewer wound infections (2 % versus 11 %), less requirement for narcotic analgesia, and an earlier return to normal activity (median 7 days versus 14 days). There was no difference in morbidity, and both groups had a median time to discharge of 3 days. Laparoscopic appendectomy is as safe as open appendectomy; and despite the longer operating time, the advantages such as fewer wound infections and earlier return to normal activity make it a worthwhile alternative for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis...|$|E

Therefore, we started a large multi-centre case series in 2008. The {{aim of this}} paper is to present the study design and early results of a single arm of a prospective, consecutive, monitored, post-market follow-up evaluation of Gamma 3 nails. Methods: From September 2009 to January 2012, 154 consecutive patients with an average age of 80 ± 1. 43 years (50 - 99 years) and a trochanteric femoral fracture were included in the local arm of the trial. All patients that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were treated with a Gamma 3 nail. Preoperative variables included age, gender, fracture classification, walking ability (Merle d’Aubigné score), daily activity level (retrospective Zuckerman score), <b>ASA</b> <b>rating</b> of operative risk, waiting time for operation, use of walker or crutches and body mass index (BMI). Skin-to-skin time, fluoroscopy time, blood loss, intraoperative complications and device information were recorded for each patient.

Except for the finale and some night scenes, the entire movie is shot with clear, cold light permeating the surroundings. The {{lighting}} and camerawork used in Andrzej Żuławski's Possession (1981) was {{an influence on}} the film's look. Although tenebr(a)e means [...] "darkness" [...] or [...] "shadows" [...] in Latin, Argento ordered cinematographer Luciano Tovoli to use as much bright light as possible. The director intended that the film be set {{in the near future}} and wanted the lighting to help create a [...] "cold, stark and semi-futuristic look". Argento explained that this approach was also an attempt to imitate what he saw as the [...] "realistic manner of lighting" [...] used in television police shows. The director explained that he was adopting [...] "a modern style of photography, deliberately breaking with the legacy of German Expressionism. Today's light is the light of neon, headlights, and omnipresent flashes... Caring about shadows seemed ridiculous to me and, more than that, reassuring." [...] Argento filmed half-empty streets and shops where he could, in an attempt to reflect a futuristic setting where a disaster had diminished significantly the population of his imaginary city. Tovoli used Kodak 5247 film stock (125 <b>ASA</b> speed <b>rating)</b> for daylight scenes, and Kodak 5293 (250 ASA) for night shoots. Tovoli rated both at 300 ASA to ensure controlled overexposure of the negative during filming, for the benefit of under-developing in the lab and less colour loss. The ultimate aim was for the images to be [...] "crystal clear", and the night scenes to be awash with light.|$|R
40|$|Background: Management of distal {{malignant}} large bowel obstruction (LBO) remains challenging. Acute surgical {{intervention is}} {{often associated with}} poorer clinical outcome compared to an elective procedure. Self-expandable metallic stents (SEMS) as a bridge to surgery (BTS) or palliation remain controversial and are not yet widely available. Methods: From 1998 to 2008, a retrospective analysis of the patients presenting with an acute malignant LBO to The Tweed Public and John Flynn Private Hospitals was performed. Results: Fifty-six admissions with malignant distal colonic obstruction were reviewed. On an intention to treat, patients underwent either stent 30 or surgery 26. American Association of Anaesthetists (<b>ASA)</b> scores, obesity <b>rates</b> and palliative procedures were all higher in the stent group. Inpatient deaths numbered four (two stent group, two surgery group). The technical success of inserted stents was 29 / 30, while clinical success was 27 / 30. Complications both medical, surgical and intensive care unit admissions were more common in the surgical group. Length of stay was 8. 5 days for stent and 17. 7 days for surgery. Of the 25 successful stent survivors, 14 were palliative and 11 were BTS. Conclusions: SEMS are effective in treatment of LBO either as palliation or BTS. They are associated with an overall better outcome and improved quality of life of patients. Surgery is indicated where SEMS are unavailable or have failed...|$|R

The procedure, its indications, results and clinical outcomes will be addressed, as will its current position compared to surgical myectomy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the results of ASA in all patients treated in the first four years of activity at our center. METHODS: We retrospectively studied all consecutive and unselected patients treated by ASA between January 2009 and February 2013. RESULTS: In the first four years of experience 40 patients were treated in our center. In three patients (7. 5 %) the intervention was repeated. Procedural success was 84 %. Minor complications occurred in 7. 5 %. Two patients received a permanent pacemaker for atrioventricular block (6 % of those without previous pacemaker). The major complication rate was 5 %. There were no in-hospital deaths; during clinical follow-up (22 ± 14 months) cardiovascular mortality was 2. 5 % and overall mortality was 5 %. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results presented reflect the initial experience of our center with <b>ASA.</b> The success <b>rate</b> was high and in line with published results, but with room to improve with better patient selection. ASA was shown to be safe, with a low complication rate and no procedure-related mortality.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether the length of the laparoscopic time before the decision to convert during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for acute cholecystitis (AC) has any impact on the patients’ course. Methods: Medical records of 3832 patients undergone LC for AC during the last ﬁfteen years in our unit, were retrospectively analyzed. 71 of these (1. 9 %) were converted to open. We divided them into two groups: G 1 (n= 52, 73 %) included patients who had conversion within 2 h from the beginning of the operation, and G 2 (n= 19, 27 %) included patients converted after more than 2 h of laparoscopy. We analyzed and compared the following parameters: patients’ general characteristic (age, gender, BMI, <b>ASA</b> score), <b>rate</b> of gangrenous acute cholecystitis, mean operative time, mean length of postoperative stay, morbidity and mortality. Morbidity was graded according to Clavien and Dindo classiﬁcation. A p value< 0. 05 was considered signiﬁcant. Results: 71 LC were converted for severe inﬂammation (33, 46 %), strength visceral adhesions (19, 27 %), inability to remove stones from common biliary duct (10, 14 %), pneumoperitoneum intolerance (6, 9 %), duodenal injuries (2, 3 %) and arterial bleeding (1, 1 %). Between G 1 and G 2, F/M ratio (11 / 33 vs 5 / 14, p= 0. 57) and mean BMI (25. 3 vs 27. 4 kg/m 2, p= 0. 09) were not signiﬁcantly different. Conversely, there was a signiﬁcant difference in terms of age (mean, 71 vs 63. 4 yrs, p= 0. 03) and ASA score (mean, 2. 44 vs 2, p= 0. 01). Mean operative time was 174. 5 in G 1 and 235. 2 in G 2 patients. The rate of gangrenous cholecystitis was 38 % in G 1 and 21 % in G 2 (p= 0. 25). There were no significant differences regarding overall morbidity (26. 9 % vs 36. 8 %, p= 0. 41), mortality (2 % vs 5 %, p= 0. 45), and post-operative stay (mean 8. 69 vs 8. 27 days, p= 0. 41). However, major complications (grade III-V according to Clavien and Dindo classiﬁcation) were 28 % in G 1 and 86 % in G 2 (p= 0. 02). Conclusion: In patients with AC, a laparoscopic time lasting more than 2 h before conversion seems to be linked to the occurrence of major complications, although it does not affect mortality and length of hospital sta...|$|R
40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS. High {{levels of}} {{inflammation}} locally in the graft {{during the initial}} days after transplantation can cause primary non-function (PNF) of grafted xenogeneic islets in NOD mice. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore in a model of spontaneous diabetes, the NOD mouse, the potential of anti-inflammatory agents in the prevention of PNF after xenogeneic islet transplantation. METHODS. Spontaneously diabetic NOD mice were transplanted with 300 rat islets. Animals were treated with acetylsalicylic acid (AsA), rofecoxib, TGF-beta or IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 ra). Intra-graft expression of inflammation-related molecules was measured by real time PCR 8 h post-transplantation. At the same time point, plasma nitrite levels were measured. RESULTS. Xenogeneic islets transplanted in control spontaneously diabetic mice resulted in PNF in 16 out of 38 mice (42 %). Initial graft loss was not altered by administration of rofecoxib (30 %) or TGF-beta (25 %). <b>AsA</b> reduced the <b>rate</b> of rapid graft loss to 8 % (p< 0. 05 vs controls) and administration of IL- 1 ra even totally prevented PNF (0 %, p< 0. 05 vs controls). Furthermore, all therapies prolonged the mean survival time of xenogeneic islet grafts. The inhibition of PNF by AsA was associated with decreased intra-islet levels of inflammation-related molecules (IL- 1, TNF-alpha, iNOS, COX- 2) and chemokines (MCP- 1 and MIP- 3 alpha). Finally, also a diminished production of systemic nitrite levels was observed in AsA- and IL- 1 ra-treated islet recipients. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION. These data show that treatment with AsA or IL- 1 ra prevents PNF after islet transplantation in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice. Moreover, the involvement of non-specific inflammation is recognized in xenogeneic islet PNF in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice. status: publishe...|$|R

It is possible to resolve both gallbladder and bile duct stones with a single procedure. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the effectiveness of a single stage procedure for gallbladder and bile duct stones in the elderly patients and to expose the differences between the various techniques. From January 2008 to December 2013, we treated 1540 patients with gallbladder stones. In 152 cases, we also found bile duct stones. 150 of these were treated in a single stage procedure. We divided our patients into 2 groups: Group A was younger than 65 (104 patients); Group B was 65 or older (46 patients). We retrospectively compared sex, <b>ASA</b> score, conversion <b>rate,</b> success rate, post-operative complications, hospital stay, and treatment method. We had no intra-operative mortality. 1 patient in Group B, heart condition (ASA 4), died with multiple organ failure (MOF) 10 days after his operation. ASA score: 3. 5  ±  0. 5 in A vs 2  ±  0. 9 in B (P 0. 001), post-operative complications 6 % in A vs 18. 1 % in B (P 0. 0325) and hospital stay 4. 1  ±  2. 3 in A vs 9. 5  ±  5. 5 in B (P 0. 0001) were significantly higher in Group B. No differences were found in term of success rate: 94 % in A vs 90 % in B (P 0. 4944). The procedure used to obtain the clearance of the bile duct showed a different success rate across the two groups: for the patients under 65 years old, trans-cystic clearance (TC-CBDE) was successful in 90 % of cases, and only 51 % for those older than 65, where we had to recall 49 % for laparo-endoscopic rendez-vous (RV-IOERC) (P 0. 0014).

Ninety min before they had received aspirin (ASA, 250 mg e. v.), or placebo (2 × 2 factorial design). Twelve animals presented reocclusion and were excluded for subsequent analysis, 2 of them receiving ASA and 10 not (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Budget impact {{analysis}} of ticagrelor for preventive treatment {{of patients with}} acute coronary syndromesBackgroundTicagrelor 90 mg BID is indicated {{for the prevention of}} thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Outcomes from the PLATO trial demonstrated that ticagrelor + <b>ASA</b> reduced the <b>rate</b> of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to clopidogrel + ASA. ObjectiveThis analysis estimated the budget impact of the use of ticagrelor and clopidogrel for the prevention of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with ACS in Italy, based on the PLATO trial results. MethodsA budget-impact model (BIM) was developed to estimate the direct costs up to 12 months after an ACS event from the Italian NHS perspective. Resource utilization (drugs, screening, monitoring, hospitalizations and transfusions) was derived from the PLATO trial. Only direct medical costs were considered. Ex-factory prices (including all discounts) and National Tariffs were used to estimate the costs of drugs and medical resource, respectively. The BIM showed the difference in expenditure and cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death – PLATO trial) generated by the base case as calculated for current prescription volumes (ticagrelor 50. 6 %, clopidogrel 49. 4 %), and for different prescription volume scenarios (ticagrelor at 75 % and 100 %). Key variables were tested in the sensitivity analysis. ResultsTicagrelor was associated with a medical cost offset driven by fewer hospitalizations; this partly offsets the incremental drug cost and results in an annual incremental cost per patient of € 32. 53 (€ 11, 526. 03 for ticagrelor and € 11, 493. 50 for clopidogrel). Based on data from the PLATO trial, the incidence of ACS and current prescription volumes in Italy, the BIM predicts that the total number of cardiovascular events and costs are 6, 169 and € 652. 3 M, respectively. The BIM predicts that ticagrelor is associated with 550 fewer cardiovascular events at an incremental cost of € 8. 8 M compared to generic clopidogrel. The impact of total annual costs for the Italian NHS would be limited if ticagrelor prescription volumes would be higher. The total cost is predicted to increase by 0. 07 % if ticagrelor prescription goes up to 75 %, while the reduction of cardiovascular events is estimated to be considerably lower than - 4. 9 %. ConclusionsUtilization of ticagrelor, as an alternative to generic clopidogrel to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with ACS, could represent an effective, low-cost treatment option for the Italian NHS...|$|R
40|$|Aim. The {{aim of this}} {{randomized}} {{study was}} to evaluate the safety and efficacy of septal myectomy (SM) and alcohol septal ablation (ASA) in patients with an obstructive form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Methods. The study included 76 patients eligible for ASA and Morrow myectomy. The patients {{were divided into two}} equal groups: one for ASA (n = 38), the other for SM. The primary endpoint (combined) was to assess the safety, which included 30 -day complications after surgery (mortality, bleeding, tamponade, stroke, development of VT / VF) and the frequency of pacemaker/ICD implantation. Secondary endpoints focused on the evaluation of pressure gradient (efficiency), repeated operations, clinical and functional indicators, volume and mass of the ablation zone and dissected infarction. Control observation period was 12 months. Results. By the end of control observations, it was found out that SM is a safer technique as compared to <b>ASA,</b> the complication <b>rate</b> was 13 % and 47 % respectively (log-rank test p = 0. 0021; Cox: HR 11. 4 95 % CI [1. 52 - 11. 1] p = 0. 005). No significant differences in early (30 days) postoperative complications were found (log-rank test p = 0. 24; Cox: HR 2. 52, 95 % CI [0. 48 - 12. 9] p = 0. 27). Rhythm disturbances requiring pacemaker implantation / ICD (log-rank test p = 0. 0029; Cox: HR 95 % CI 4. 92 [1. 06 - 22. 74] p = 0. 042) were the most common complication. In both groups, there was a significant reduction of the LVOT gradient, p < 0. 01. However, the residual gradient in the ASA group was significantly higher than that in the SM group, p < 0. 01. Clinical data of both groups were comparable in the long term. A significant correlation was observed between the dissected infarction volume and the degree of reduction in the LVOT gradient of the SM group, p = 0. 01. No significant dependency of the ablation zone volume on the degree of reduction in the LVOT gradient was observed, p = 0. 7. Conclusion. Septal myectomy is a safe treatment for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as compared to ASA. Alcohol septal ablation and SM are comparable in the effectiveness of LVOT gradient reduction. There is a dependence of the excised myocardium volume and the degree of reduction in the LVOT gradient during long-term follow-up of patients who underwent Morrow SM. Received 5 August 2016.
