40|$|In {{large-scale}} wireless sensor networks, {{due to the}} randomly {{movements of}} nodes and a sink, the network topology is changing frequently. Because nodes and the sink {{do not know the}} position each other, they can't communicate with each other well. If nodes use the method of broadcast to send their data, the data may be continuously forwarded before they received by the Sink, which leads that energy consumption of nodes are not balanced and shorten the network lifetime. In order to maximize the network lifetime, this paper puts forward an algorithm to solve the above problem, named energy equalization algorithm based on controllable transmission direction (CTDEE). Firstly, nodes perform a type change algorithm, and a node with higher energy will use a higher probability to decide whether to become a collector. Secondly, nodes adopt the method of preferential orientation transmission to send their data. Finally, collectors send their data to the mobile sink with the method of optimal binary <b>angle</b> <b>transmission.</b> The simulation results show that CTDEE can achieve better performance on controlling the direction of data transmission and energy equalization, effectively reducing energy overhead, shortening data collection delay, and finally prolonging the network lifetime. ...|$|E

The algorithm is engineered to model experimental configurations where irregularities in surface geometry preclude {{the use of}} less rigorous approaches, such as a field expansion about a single entry point. The algorithm formulation represents the transmitted pulse as a surface integral coinciding with a pulse origin aperture, employing the Green function for the water-component system. The model explicitly considers the component surface geometry over the footprint of the incident pulse, thus allowing consideration of smooth yet non-expandable (i. e. in power series about a single point) geometries, such as adjoining flat and fillet surfaces. A computationally efficient algorithm results from use of asymptotic Green function approximations.

This generates Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs) with very dynamic topologies and loose connectivity that depend on mobility of the mobile devices. Data collection from these mobile sensors has become a great challenge considering volatile topologies, loose connectivity and limited buffer storage. This paper proposes a stochastic compressive data collection protocol for MWSNs named SMITE. SMITE consists of three parts: random collector election, stochastic direct transmission from common nodes to collectors when common nodes are in the collectors ’ transmission range, and <b>angle</b> <b>transmission</b> from collectors to the mobile sink when collectors gather enough data using a predictive method. The collectors use bloom filters to compress the received data. The protocol’s performance is theoretically analyzed.

30|$|The many-fringe {{nature of}} this Si lens’s {{transmission}} pattern is explained as follows. First, two types of waves co-exist in the transmission side: direct transmission through a Si layer and aperture transmission through 8 tilted-nanoslits formed in Si. Two different types of interference patterns will then be generated: (1) between direct transmission and aperture transmission and (2) between two aperture transmissions coming from opposing directions. Type 1 interference involves planar wavefronts (of direct transmission) and circular wavefronts (of aperture transmission). The resulting fringe pattern evolves into a parabolic profile at far-field [40]. Type 2 interference involves two circular wavefronts arriving from opposing directions, and produces the central peak and satellite peaks at the focal plane. The direct transmission through a Si(150  nm)/SiO 2 layer {{is estimated to be}} 63 % (transmittance). It {{is interesting to note that}} the central peak is of similar intensity with side lobes. This implies that the transmission through a Si nanoslit aperture is reasonably strong. In brief, the following conclusions can be drawn from this simulation study: a far-field sub-diffraction-limited beam focusing is demonstrated with an all-dielectric (Si/SiO 2) nanolens that employs a slanted nanoslit array for glancing <b>angle</b> <b>transmission</b> of light; the direct transmission through the dielectric layers is found to be strong, generating many side lobes of high intensity.|$|E

This is to gain knowledge about the glass-forming ability in these systems and to contribute with structural data for future studies on W-Me-C phase equilibria ternary diagrams. The chemical and structural characterization of the films was performed by means of electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), secondary ion mass spectrometry (Sims), X-ray diffraction (XRD) at low <b>angle,</b> <b>transmission</b> electron microscopy (Tem), Moessbauer spectroscopy, extended x-ray absorption fine structure (Exafs) and differential thermal analysis (Dta). The results show that most of the transition metals form a c. f. c. phase of #beta#-MC_ 1 _-_x (M = W, Me) with tungsten and carbon: the structure becomes amorphous on the addition of small amounts of a VIIIA transition metal. The thermal stability of the W-Me-C films with temperature is dependent on the affinity of carbon for the element Me.

40|$|Diffraction {{gratings}} {{are fundamental}} optical elements that separate incident light into its constituent wavelength components. This dispersive feature of diffraction gratings has been broadly utilized in many applications including spectroscopy, microscopy, and interferometry. As high-energy electromagnetic waves, such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and x rays, {{are of interest}} in various science fields including astrophysics, fine pitch gratings with high diffraction efficiency are required. The critical <b>angle</b> <b>transmission</b> (CAT) grating has been devised to enhance diffraction efficiency of a transmission grating via reflection from the grating sidewalls. The shallow critical angle (1 - 2 °) for total external reflection of incident x rays defines the geometry of the CAT grating and a consequent blazing condition. However, the geometrical requirements for the mirror-like grating bars with a very high aspect ratio are challenging to fabricate. The work presented in {{this thesis is about}} how to produce the CAT gratings by integrating many micro and nano-fabrication technologies. The fabrication process involves interference lithography for patterning fine pitch gratings and wet anisotropic etching on thin silicon membranes for straight and ultrahigh aspectratio (~ 150) freestanding structures. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) etching of the nanostructure is extensively investigated to improve etch anisotropy, uniformity, and process latitude.

In the case of biological samples, Activation of Jurkat T-cells in culture following treatment with anti-CD 3 (Cluster of Differentiation 3) antibody is detectable by interrogating the treated T-cells using the Attenuated Total Reflection - Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) Spectroscopy technique. Cell activation was detected within 75 minutes after the cells encountered specific immunoglobulin molecules. Spectral markers noted following ligation of the CD 3 receptor with anti CD 3 antibody provides proof-of-concept that ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is a sensitive measure of molecular events subsequent to cells interacting with anti-CD 3 Immunoglobulin G (IgG). ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is also used to screen for Colitis in chronic (Interleukin 10 knockout) and acute (Dextran Sodium Sulphate-induced) models. Arthritis (Collagen Antibody Induced Arthritis) and metabolic syndrome (Toll like receptor 5 knockout) models are also tested as controls. The marker identified as mannose uniquely screens and distinguishes the colitic from the non-colitic samples and the controls.

An instrument utilising digital sampling techniques has been built and evaluated at the Swedish National Testing and Research Institute (SP). The Digital Sampling Watt Meter (DSWM) is based on standard laboratory equipment: digital multimeters, voltage dividers, shunt resistors and a PC. The DSWM is versatile {{and can be used}} for calibrations of many quantities. The most basic ones are the (total) active power and the amplitude and phase angle of individual harmonics of non-sinusoidal voltages and currents. The DSWM was first verified for sinusoidal signals. At 120 V and 5 A and power factor one, the DSWM has an estimated uncertainty (2 s) of 60 ppm at 50 Hz and 600 ppm at 20 kHz. The wattmeter has also participated in three international comparison with satisfactory results. The most important additional feature, the input distortion, has been verified to be less than 800 ppm for all harmonics and lower than 100 ppm for most harmonics. Some AC quantities, as the reactive power, are not properly defined for non-sinusoidal situations. Efforts are made in this work to understand and explain the problems of extending the reactive power definition to cover non-sinusoidal situations. The main conclusion is that reactive power is used to obtain information on more than one property of the power transmission mechanism, e. g. phase <b>angle,</b> <b>transmission</b> efficiency and line voltage drop. No single power definition can alone provide information on all these properties in a non-sinusoidal situation. Moreover, instrument designs may not comply with any of the extended definitions and these meters exhibit extra errors due to this non-compliance in non-sinusoidal situations.

We then use the rough surface boundary conditions of conical scattering from the coherent part, in the incoherent radiative transfer equations. The radiative transfer equations are then solved iteratively that includes multiple interactions between the layered structures and the rough surfaces.
