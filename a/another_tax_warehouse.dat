In contrast to value added tax, they are mainly specific taxes, i. e. expressed as a monetary amount per quantity of the product. The most commonly applied excise duties are those on alcoholic beverages, manufactured tobacco products and energy products (motor fuels and heating fuels, such as petrol and gasoline, electricity, natural gas, coal and coke). The basic principles applicable to all products subject to excise duties have been laid down in Council Directive 92 / 12 /EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products. Products subject to excise duties are generally produced, and can afterwards be held under duty suspension, in <b>tax</b> <b>warehouses.</b> The establishment and operation of <b>tax</b> <b>warehouses</b> is subject to the authorization of the Member States. They should respect the principles laid down in Commission Recommendation 2000 / 789 /EC of 29 November 2000 setting out guidelines for the authorisation of warehousekeepers under Council Directive 92 / 12 /EEC in relation to products subject to excise duty.

40|$|From a {{temporal}} perspective, the collected tax revenues {{for the public}} budget know a number of changes in terms of flow and collection rates due to changes in factors of influence. The most used method to measure the response, the sensitivity of tax revenue to any changes of a variable is elasticity. This paper seeks to briefly examine the sensitivity of tax revenues to changes occurring in terms {{of gross domestic product}} and tax burden in Romania during 2000 to 2009. After analysis, we believe that a pattern regarding the sensitivity of tax revenues to the modification of a factor can not be created, tax elasticity developments and alternations of elasticity / inelasticity are not based on a uniform rule, they differ from country to country, and even in the same country from one period to <b>another.</b> <b>Tax</b> elasticity, tax burden, tax revenues...|$|R

In a model with capital and labor taxation, we show that under plausible assumptions the welfare effect of coordinating the capital tax only is then still nonnegative.
