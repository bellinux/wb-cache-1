2500|$|Theories {{derived from}} early unilingual {{research}} relied mainly upon generalizations without precise specification {{of how these}} specific systems of lexical access works. Due {{to the advancement of}} medical science within the last decade, the field of Psycholinguistics has evolved immensely, resulting in more detailed research and therefore, {{a deeper understanding of the}} mechanisms behind language production. [...] "Many early studies of second language acquisition focused on the morphosyntactic development of learners, and the general findings was that bound morphemes appear in the same order in the first and second language"(Bardovi-Harlig 1999. In addition, [...] "second language learners are also able to produce and process simple sentences before complex sentences" [...] (Pienemann et al.2005), just like first language learners. For example, the theory of serial search models and parallel access models. Serial Search Models propose that when monolinguals encounter a word, they will look through all the lexical entries to distinguish whether the input item is a word not, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> only retrieve the necessary information about that word (i.e., its semantics or orthography). They also propose that the lexical access would process sequentially by activating only one lexical entry at a time. In contrast, the Parallel Access Models believe that multiple entries can be activated at once, which means that the perceptual input from a word would activate all lexical items directly, even though some of them might not be necessary. In this way, numbers of potential candidates would be activated simultaneously and then the lexical candidates which are most consistent with the input stimulus would be chosen. [...] Later, the researchers addressed that both the serial and parallel process are accounted for the lexical organization and lexical access.|$|E
