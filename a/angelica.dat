40|$|Objectives: <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis Radix {{has been}} known {{traditional}} medicine with antimicrobial activities {{and it has been}} widely used for treatment of blood and inflammatory diseases. In the present study, some studies examined anti-inflammation effects of <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis Radix but they usually were performed by ethanol extracted <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis Radix pharmacopuncture. So We investigated the inhibitory effects of <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis Radix pharmacopuncture by hot water and ethanol extract on Nitric oxide(NO) and Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) production in lipopolysaccharide(LPS) induced macrophage cell. Methods: <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis Radix was extracted by ethanol and hot water. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. To evaluate anti-inflammation effects of <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis Radix pharmacopuncture, we examined NO and PGE 2 production in LPS induced macrophages. The concentrations of NO and PGE 2 were measured by Griess assay and Enzyme Immuno-Assay. Results: 1) The MTT assay demonstrated that cytotoxic effect of <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis Radix pharmacopuncture by hot water extract and ethanol extract in RAW 264. 7 macrophage cells were not appeared. 2) <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis Radix pharmacopuncture by ethanol extract and hot water extract inhibited NO production in LPS induced macrophages significantly. 3) <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis Radix pharmacopuncture by ethanol extract tended to inhibiting PGE 2 production in LPS induced macrophages. And <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis Radix pharmacopuncture by hot water extract inhibited LPS induced production of PGE 2 in RAW 264. 7 macrophage cells significantly. Conclusions: This study suggests that <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis Radix pharmacopuncture may have an anti-inflammatory property through the inhibition of NO and PGE 2 production in LPS induced macrophages. It may have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases...|$|R
40|$|A {{collection}} of 102 Diaporthe isolates was compiled from lesions on carrot, parsley and wild Apiaceae species in France from 2010 to 2014. Molecular typing based on ITS rDNA sequences {{resulted in the}} identification of 85 D. <b>angelicae</b> and 17 D. eres isolates. Based on sequences of the 30 part of the IGS rDNA, intraspecific variability was analysed for 17 D. <b>angelicae</b> and 13 D. eres isolates from diverse plant species, locations in France, and plant tissues. The genetic diversity was greater for D. <b>angelicae</b> isolates than D. eres isolates. In vitro sensitivity of five D. <b>angelicae</b> and four D. eres isolates to each of nine fungicides was similar for isolates of both species, with a marked variation in fungicide sensitivity depending on the active ingredient. To assess the pathogenicity of D. <b>angelicae</b> and D. eres isolates on carrot, one isolate of each species was inoculated onto umbels in a controlled environment. Typical lesions were observed for both isolates. Carrot crop debris collected from a seed production field in France and placed in controlled conditions produced perithecia and ascospores typical of Diaporthe, that were further characterized molecularly as belonging to D. <b>angelicae.</b> Detection of Diaporthe species on seed lots from three carrot production fields in France was investigated. Both species were detected on seeds by conventional PCR assay, with a greater frequency for D. <b>angelicae</b> than D. eres (67 % vs 33 %, respectively). Overall, the results highlighted that umbel browning in carrot seed crops in France was mainly caused by D. <b>angelicae...</b>|$|R

5|$|Hamilton {{was also}} close to Elizabeth's sisters.

Even though the style of their correspondence during Angelica's 14-year residence in Europe was flirtatious, modern historians like Chernow and Fielding agree that despite contemporary gossip there is no conclusive evidence that Hamilton's relationship with <b>Angelica</b> was ever physical or went beyond a strong affinity between in-laws.

5|$|Vegetation: Most of {{the spray}} zone {{adjacent}} to the Falls is covered with patches of various mosses, liverworts, and other low herbaceous vegetation, including Eutrochium purpureum, <b>Angelica</b> atropurpurea, and Aster spp. In addition, watercress Nasturtium officinale increased after the 1993 flood event. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found on vegetation up to 92cm above the ground and at 1/3 the maximum sunlight intensities of the sympatric Succinea sp. B. Vegetation is quite sparse {{on the west side}} of the Falls, and the only snails that have been observed there are Succinea sp. B. In drier talus {{adjacent to the}} mossy areas are various plant species, such as eastern skunk cabbage Symplocarpus foetidus and <b>Angelica</b> atropurpurea, upon which Succinea sp. B has also been found. During periods of heavy water flow, dew, or rain, when the vegetation is saturated, the snails have been observed actively crawling on the vegetation. During drier times, both species of snails attach themselves to the underside of leaves with a mucous epiphragm. In the patch of watercress, the vegetation is dense and lush. Although the watercress is dominant, other species include <b>Angelica</b> atropurpurea, jewelweed Impatiens capensis and Impatiens pallida, forget-me-nots Myosotis scorpioides, various mints Mentha spp., and poison ivy Toxicodendron radicans, which again support Succinea sp. B but not Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. The ledges where Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is found clearly comprise an early successional sere, periodically rejuvenated to a bare rock substrate by flood waters.|$|E
