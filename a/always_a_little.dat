500|$|... "Grief Counseling" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} Jennifer Celotta, and was directed by Roger Nygard, his only episode of The Office to date. In a later interview with Den of Geek, Nygard found that [...] "television episodes are {{the domain of the}} writer-producers. You are there to service their vision. The Office is fully scripted, but there's <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> room to play when it's warranted. The first cuts are around 45 minutes, so you often have to cut the episodes in half for air." [...] Though [...] "Grief Counseling" [...] broadcast before the fifth episode, [...] "Initiation", its filming took place after that episode due to the availability of shooting on Dwight's fictional beet farm.|$|E
500|$|... "Hungry Like the Wolf" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} contemporary pop music critics. Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork Media in a 2003 {{review of the}} [...] "Singles Box Set 1981-1985", said that [...] "singles don't come much stronger than 'Hungry Like the Wolf'," [...] praising its [...] "bubbly keys around a slashing guitar riff," [...] adding that the song [...] "show off how Duran Duran was a band, not just a synthesizer." [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times, said the song [...] "put an oblique, sometimes apocalyptic spin on pop romance in the verses but kept the choruses clear and catchy, never disguising their pop intentions," [...] adding that the [...] "posing was <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> preposterous, but no less enjoyable for that." ...|$|E
500|$|Marmarosa {{began his}} {{professional}} career around 1941, joining the Johnny [...] "Scat" [...] Davis orchestra {{at the age}} of 15 or 16. He was first mentioned in the national jazz press the following year, appearing in Down Beat magazine for his playing at a jam session. After touring, the Davis orchestra disbanded, so Marmarosa and others then joined Gene Krupa around the end of 1942. After one 1943 Krupa performance in Philadelphia, Marmarosa was beaten into a coma by sailors who accused him of draft dodging. According to clarinetist Buddy DeFranco, who was also attacked by the men, [...] "Dodo was <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> off but he seemed different after that beating. The head injury didn't affect his playing, but I think it created psychological problems for him." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{a ten-year}} absence of nighttime-run stages, {{the first two}} Special Stages of the event were held on Thursday night. They were the first night stages {{scheduled}} in the rally since 1997. Throughout the day it had rained, and although it had stopped before the race began, the roads were still very wet and slippery. In discussing the day's weather, Grönholm said that he expected the stages that night to be difficult, and added, [...] "I hope this time we can take the right tyres, we were <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit {{on the wrong side}} – it’s not easy, but I hope we will manage to get it right this time." [...] Earlier in the day, the crews had driven a shakedown stage in Mauves; however, due to a large number of fans and spectators along the route the shakedown was stopped early, and some crews including Loeb and co-driver Daniel Elena were forced to carry out last-minute testing and necessary changes to their cars on the main roads back to Valence. Though forty-nine crews registered in the rally, only forty-seven actually competed. Privateers François Duval driving a , and Angelo Villa in a [...] failed to start the event.|$|E
500|$|Wodehouse {{expected}} to follow Armine to the University of Oxford, but the family's finances took {{a turn for the}} worse at the crucial moment. Ernest Wodehouse had retired in 1895, and his pension was paid in rupees; fluctuation against the pound reduced its value in Britain. Wodehouse recalled, [...] "The wolf was not actually whining at the door and there was <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> something in the kitty for the butcher and the grocer, but the finances would not run to anything in the nature of a splash". Instead of a university career, in September 1900 Wodehouse was engaged in a junior position in the London office of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. He was unsuited to it and found the work baffling and uncongenial. He later wrote a humorous account of his experiences at the bank, but at the time he longed for the end of each working day, when he could return to his rented lodgings in Chelsea and write. At first he concentrated, with some success, on serious articles about school sports for Public School Magazine. In November 1900 his first comic piece, [...] "Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings," [...] was accepted by Tit-Bits. A new magazine for boys, The Captain, provided further well-paid opportunities, and during his two years at the bank, Wodehouse had eighty pieces published in a total of nine magazines.|$|E
500|$|... 2003 {{marked a}} {{significant}} {{turning point in}} Sarsgaard's career, when he starred in the feature film Shattered Glass. He depicted journalist Charles Lane, the lead editor of The New Republic. Shattered Glass {{is based on the}} real events of journalist Stephen Glass' career at The New Republic during the mid-1990s and his fall when his widespread journalistic fraud is exposed. During promotion of the film, Sarsgaard noted of his portrayal of Lane: [...] "I just wanted to get his perspective on the actual events. [...] I think that I tried to have some respect for myself and that way you're respecting the real person you're playing. I've done it a number of times. And it's <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit confusing. The {{best thing to do is}} just to ignore the fact, I think, that you're playing somebody who is a real life character." [...] According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, [...] "Peter Sarsgaard is appealingly level, a stolid straight-shooter as Lane". A reviewer from the Chicago Tribune noted that Sarsgaard plays Lane with [...] "great subtlety and grace". The newspaper concluded with, [...] "The character doesn't seethe with personal resentment; when he does a slow burn, he conveys a much deeper sense of a man's value system being violated past the breaking point." [...] Sarsgaard's performance in the film earned him his first Golden Globe Award nomination and an Independent Spirit Award nomination.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, {{more than}} a year before Miller's death, The Guardian wrote, [...] "Scott Miller was <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too out of time for his own good, which means his towering talent is near forgotten", {{attributing}} Miller's cult status to the contradictions of [...] "pretty but muscular pop, characterised by a mix of acoustic and electric guitars, by literate but often non-specific lyrics, by keyboard sounds and production techniques that were sometimes unfortunately era-specific, by Miller's sometimes quavering and uncertain voice. Too spiky for the chart kids; too smooth for the alternative kids—the curse of Scott Miller was being only himself, rather than finding a movement or a trend he could be part of." ...|$|E
2500|$|Darren Wall (Wallzo), who {{previously}} designed the artwork for The Warning and Made in the Dark, {{was responsible for}} the album artwork for One Life Stand. As with previous Hot Chip album designs, Wall worked closely with Owen Clarke on the initial idea to reach [...] "a core aesthetic" [...] to experiment with. Wall expressed that over time the taste and influences of the band and himself [...] "are <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit different", which results in differing artwork. However, Wall stated that he and Clarke have [...] "hugely overlapping tastes" [...] and tend to [...] "gravitate towards 'mysterious objects' that invite interpretation" [...] such as the blocks featured on the cover of The Warning and [...] "The Artifact" [...] used for Made in the Dark. The design the duo settled on was of a suspended marble head, which was inspired by photographs of statues being lowered into place using coloured canvas slings. Wall felt this created an interesting theme due {{to the idea of a}} classical form being [...] "intersected with bright stripes of colour" [...] and the idea appealed to the band. Wall described the image and being [...] "essentially quite an over-the-top image" [...] and stated that there was [...] "plenty of Giorgio de Chirico and Hipgnosis reference" [...] in the image.|$|E
2500|$|Sherwood wrote {{some of the}} film's {{locations}} {{into the}} script as homage to Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. As Sherwood explains, [...] "The original Leatherface, Chainsaw 3, took {{the idea of the}} backwoods isolation of the original and exploded it tenfold. I always think of the locations of this film—the scrub brush filled badlands and remote roadside outposts as feeling like another world—a dark fairy tale land in some way. I filled my story with similar locations to hopefully capture a similar vibe." [...] The fictional Sawyer farm is a key location in Leatherface, which was rebuilt to accurately resemble its appearance in the first Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The farm was originally going to be used sparingly, until Sherwood discussed the matter with directors Maury and Bustillo. Sherwood stated, [...] "Developing the script with the directors was actually just super-easy. We knew {{what we wanted to do}} from the start, and they got it and they were right along with me. I didn't have the farmhouse a lot and they were like 'If we are going to build the set and this is the famous farmhouse, we should use it' and I totally agreed with that. And so we moved the third act, mostly taking place at the farmhouse." [...] The Sawyer homestead was adduced by cinematographer Antoine Sanier as being particularly rousing to film: [...] "It's a real house that has been shot many times, but we cannot see it very well [...] It's <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit hidden or dark, so it was really impressive to get into this process and also to be a link to the other guys that have been shooting this kind of set." ...|$|E
