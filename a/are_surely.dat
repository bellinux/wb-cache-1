In another article by Destructoid, Carter stated [...] "It's such a weird thing to me, because R. Mika's butt is still very visible, she just doesn't lightly tap it a few times per match." [...] Likewise, ND Medina at iDigitalTimes expressed confusion over the change, noting that her full butt was still being exposed. The butt slap was later restored as a mod for the PC version, albeit in a different pose.|$|E

2500|$|Some of the suicides {{reported}} in media outlets include, 32-year-old Stuart Matis, a gay Mormon {{active in the}} church, who completed suicide on 25 February 2000 {{on the steps of}} a California church stake center building. His death came {{during the height of the}} LDS church's fight to ban same-sex marriage in California with Prop 22 also known as Knight's Initiative. Shortly before his death he wrote a 12-page letter to his cousin in which he states that when he heard the church was asking members to donate time and money in support of Prop 22 he [...] "cried for hours in [...] room" [...] and he felt that the church's positions created an environment [...] "hostile for young gay Mormons". The letter also stated [...] "straight members have absolutely no idea what it is like to grow up gay in this church.... It is a life of constant torment, self-hatred and internalized homophobia." [...] The same month he also wrote a letter to the editor published in the BYU newspaper pleading for the acceptance of homosexual individuals in response to a letter published five days before comparing homosexuality to pedophilia, bestiality and Satanism. Right before his death he wrote a note stating, [...] "The church has no idea that ... there <b>are</b> <b>surely</b> boys and girls on their callused hands and knees imploring God to free them of their pain. They hate themselves ... God never intended me to be straight. Hopefully, my death might be a catalyst for some good." [...] Two weeks after Stuart's death on March 9, D.J. Thompson a 33-year-old gay Mormon man in Florida completed suicide after writing a note referencing Stuart's death and stating that Proposition 22 was the [...] "last straw in my lifelong battle to see peace in the world". Three weeks after Stuart's death, another gay Mormon active in the church in California was a victim of suicide. Clay Whitmer, who had become close friends with Stuart while the two were serving an LDS mission in Italy had attempted six times over a few years before but completed suicide on the seventh time. Former LDS painter Randall Lake produced several portraits of suicide including one of his Mormon boyfriend who hung himself after being ostracized a few days after they both came out.|$|E
