The Pseudomonas and Azospirillum species were able to digest ethion when cultivated in minimal salts medium. A significant decrease of the Ethion concentration was observed. On top of that, ethion was the only available source of carbon. After analysis of the compounds present in the media after digestion of ethion through bacteria, {{it turned out that}} no <b>abiotic</b> <b>hydrolytic</b> degradation products of Ethion (like ethion dioxon and ethion monoxon) were present.

In this study, PLGA were synthesized by ring-opening copolymerization (ROP) using three different catalysts. Stannous octoate is the first catalyst we used, as it is very efficient, even its toxicity is still on debate. Two others low-toxic catalysts [zinc lactate and bismuth subsalicylate (BiSS) ] were also evaluated. The comparison of these ROP was realized in terms of kinetics {{and control of the}} polymerization. Then, the influence of the catalyst on the PLGA microstructure chains is reported.

40|$|Pinnatoxins and pteriatoxins are a {{group of}} cyclic imine toxins that have {{hitherto}} only been isolated from Japanese shellfish. As with other cyclic imine shellfish toxins, pinnatoxins cause rapid death in the mouse bioassay for lipophilic shellfish toxins, {{but there is no}} evidence directly linking these compounds to human illness. We have identified the known pinnatoxins A (1) and D (6), and the novel pinnatoxins E (7), F (8) and G (5), in a range of shellfish and environmental samples from Australia and New Zealand using LC−MS. After isolation from the digestive glands of Pacific oysters, the structures of the novel pinnatoxins were determined by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, and their LD 50 values were evaluated by ip administration to mice. Examination of the toxin structures, together with analysis of environmental samples, suggests that pinnatoxins F and G are produced separately in different dinoflagellates. Furthermore, it appears probable that pinnatoxin F (8) is the progenitor of pinnatoxins D (6) and E (7), and that pinnatoxin G (6) is the progenitor of both pinnatoxins A−C (1 and 2) and pteriatoxins A−C (3 and 4), via metabolic and <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>transformations</b> in shellfish...|$|R

Both the ligand HL and complex 1 have been {{thoroughly}} characterized by elemental analyses, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, FT-IR, NMR (H- 1 and C- 13), electronic absorption, and emission spectral studies and their structures determined by X-ray single-crystal analyses. Distinctive chemodosimetric behavior of HL and 1 toward Hg 2 + has been established by UV/vis, emission, and mass spectral studies. Comparative studies further revealed that the chemodosimetric response solely originates from selective hydrolysis of the aldimine moiety over the ester group and 1 exhibited greater selectivity toward Hg 2 + relative to HL while the sensitivity order is reversed. Further, these followed different hydrolytic pathways but {{ended up with the}} same product analyzed for diethyl- 5 -aminoisophthalate (DEA).

This structure emerges through reorganization of the intermediate ordered mesoporous lamellar structure. The distance between lamellae is about 3 nm. They are oriented parallel to the { 1 0 0 } crystallographic direction in the precursor crystals and originate most probably through contraction and densiﬁcation of the layers of precursor molecules {{in the course of}} the process. Similar mechanisms are observed even for <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>transformation</b> of nanocrystals of other alkoxide precursors, derivatives of volatile alcohols, permitting to achieve surface area up to 350 m 2 g 1. The obtained material is completely free from organics, but highly hygroscopic. Powders produced within 3 min show very broad X-ray diffraction peaks, indicating low volume coherence domains, but continued reﬂuxing offers a strongly improved XPD pattern after 10 min and a fully crystalline material with coherence domain equivalent to the individual particle size after only 30 min.

40|$|Veterinary {{pharmaceuticals}} {{are routinely}} used in livestock production to treat diseases, prevent infections, and promote growth. However, the potential release of pharmaceuticals from agricultural activities has raised concerns {{because they may}} pose detrimental effects to the ecosystems and human health, for example fostering the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the natural environment. A {{better understanding of the}} environmental fate of veterinary pharmaceuticals is critical to properly assess and mitigate their risks. This dissertation focuses on a major group of veterinary pharmaceuticals, ionophore antibiotics (IPAs), which is sold at over 4 million kilograms per year and constitutes more than one third of the total antibiotic consumption by the livestock industry in the U. S. Despite the extensive usage of IPAs, their environmental fate was not well-understood. Therefore, this study aimed at achieving a comprehensive understanding of the occurrence, persistence, and transformation of IPAs from poultry litter before and after applications to the agricultural lands. Three of the most commonly used members of IPAs were investigated in this study: monensin (MON), salinomycin (SAL), and narasin (NAR). Based on the common management practices of poultry litter, the potential abiotic and biotic transformation reactions of IPAs were examined under varying conditions relevant to the water-soil-litter systems. This dissertation consists of three sections. First, a robust analytical method was developed to quantify IPAs in various environmental compartments, especially in high organic-containing matrices such as poultry litter, and soil and runoff from litter-fertilized lands. Efforts were made to optimize the analytical method with respect to improving extraction recovery, reducing matrix effects, and validating a surrogate standard. Second, lab-scale experiments were set up to determine the chemical properties of IPAs in aqueous environments and to study the abiotic transformation of IPAs, including hydrolysis and photolysis. The results showed that IPAs are prone to <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>transformation</b> in acidic environments, which are likely to be encountered in acidic soils, alum-amended litter (alum: Al₂(SO₄) ₃• 12 H₂O), and acidic runoff. Multiple transformation pathways were proposed based on the identified hydrolysis products. It is also noteworthy that the hydrolysis products of MON still exhibited a toxic effect on the selected microorganism (Bacillus subtilis). SAL and NAR were found to undergo direct photolysis under both UV light and sunlight irradiation. In natural water matrix, IPAs were also degraded by indirect photolysis with hydroxyl radicals generated by light-excited nitrate. Dissolved organic matter can shield IPAs from light and slow down their photolysis. Third, the biodegradation potential of IPAs was first tested in litter and soil microcosms. Factor analysis was conducted to delineate the interaction of water and temperature on IPA degradation in the litter. Litter-fertilized and non-fertilized soil microcosms were compared on the degradation of MON and SAL. Furthermore, the inhibition and biotransformation potential of IPAs were assessed under different redox conditions with litter-enriched cultures. Inhibition tests focused on examining IPAs’ impact on microbial community functions, including denitrification, sulfate-reduction, and methane production. Biodegradation tests were conducted with different electron acceptors, including oxygen, nitrate, sulfate, and organic carbons, with efforts to elucidate primary biotransformation products. On the basis of the results obtained in this study, several recommendations on litter management and IPA selection were made to help mitigate the release and transport of IPAs, as well as enhance their degradation. Overall, this study significantly improved the understanding of the environmental fate of IPAs and the obtained knowledge can aid proper selection of IPAs and management strategies in future applications to minimize the risks of antibiotic micropollutants in the environment.

40|$|Die vorliegende Dissertation beschäftigt sich mit der Darstellung Übergangsmetall-substitutierter Silane und Untersuchungen zum Einfluss verschiedener Übergangsmetallsubstituenten auf die chemischen und spektroskopischen Eigenschaften dieser Klasse von Siliciumverbindungen. Dabei steht insbesondere die Synthese mehrfach metallierter Silanole und Siloxane im Vordergrund. A – Halogenierte Bis(metallo) silane: Durch schrittweise Umsetzung von HSiCl 3 oder HSiCl 2 Me mit den Übergangsmetallaten Na[Fe(CO) 2 Cp] oder Li[W(CO) 2 PMe 3 Cp] wurden verschiedene bismetalliete Silane [LnM] 2 SiRCl (R = H, Me) aufgebaut. Durch weitere Derivatisierung konnten u. a. die Bis(ferrio) silane [Cp(OC) 2 Fe] 2 SiX 2 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) dargestellt und z. T. durch Röntgenstrukturen charakterisiert werden. Aus diesen Verbindungen lassen sich durch photochemische CO-Eliminierung die µ 2 -silylenverbrückten Komplexe [Cp(OC) Fe] 2 (µ 2 -CO) (µ 2 -SiRHal) (R = Me, Halogen) gewinnen. B – Bis(metallo) silanole und –siloxane: Die unter A hergestellten Verbindungen dienten als Vorstufen zur Synthese der neuen Bis(ferrio) silanole [Cp(OC) 2 Fe] 2 SiX(OH) (X = H, Cl, OH) und des hetero-bismetallierten Silanols [Cp(OC) 2 Fe][Cp(OC) 2 PMe 3]SiMe(OH). Dabei konnte lediglich [Cp(OC) 2 Fe] 2 SiH(OH) durch Hydrolyse des entsprechenden halogenierten Bis(ferrio) silans hergestellt werden. Alle anderen Bis(metallo) silanole wurden durch Oxygenierung der jeweiligen SiH-funktionellen Vorstufen mit Hilfe von Dimethyldioxiran synthetisiert. Alle Bis(metallo) silanole sind stabil bezüglich Eigenkondensation, lassen sich aber mit ClSiMe 2 H in die entsprechenden Siloxane [LnM] 2 SiR(OSiMe 2 H) umwandeln. C – Co 2 (CO) 2 assistierte Hydrolyse von Silanen: Die Umsetzung verschiedener Si-H-funktioneller Silane R 3 Si-H mit Dicobaltoctacarbonyl führt unter H 2 -Entwicklung zu Cobaltio-Silanen R 3 Si-Co(CO) 4. Diese besitzen eine extrem labile Si-CoBindung, welche sich durch zahlreiche protische Reagenzien spalten läßt. Es wurden u. a die Cobaltio-Silane Me 3 SiOSiMe 2 -Co(CO 4), Me(OMe) 2 Si-Co(CO) 4 und Ph 2 SiCo 2 (CO) 7 generiert und durch Hydrolyse in verschiedene Silanole oder Siloxane überführt. Eine direkte hydrolytische SiH/SiOH-Umwandlung ist auch in Gegenwart katalytischer Mengen Co 2 (CO) 8 möglich und wurde u. a. zur Darstellung des Bis(ferrio) siloxanols [Cp(OC) 2 Fe] 2 Si(OH) (OSiMe 2 H) genutzt. D – DFT-Berechnungen an Übergangsmetallverbindungen von Silicium und Phosphor: Die Strukturen der dimeren Siloxygallane (RH 2 SiOGaMe 2) 2 (R = H, tBu) wurden theoretisch berechnet. Man findet eine starke Abhängigkeit der Geometrie des zentralen viergliedrigen Ga-O-Ga-O-Ringes von Größe und relativen Position der exocyclischen Substituenten R. Struktur- und NBO-Analyse des cyclischen Metallasiloxans Cp(OC) (H) Fe[SiMe 2 O] 2 SiMe 2 belegen den Einfluß des Cp(OC) (H) Fe-Fragmentes auf Struktur und Bindungsverhältnisse des Heterosiloxan Ringes. Relative thermodynamische Stabilitäten wurden für die diastereomeren Formen des kationischen Phosphankomplexe lk/ul-Cp*(OC) 2 Fe-P(Ph) (H) [CH(CO 2 Me) CH 2 CO 2 Me]+ und des µ 2 -silylenbrückten Eisenkomplexes cis/trans-[Cp(OC) Fe] 2 (µ 2 -CO) (µ 2 -SiH 2) theoretisch berechnet. The present Ph. D. {{thesis is}} dealing with the {{preparation}} of transition metal substituted silanes and with studies concerning the influence of various transition metal substituents on the chemical and spectroscopic properties on this class of silicon compounds. Special emphasis is laid upon the synthesis of silanols and siloxanes with multiple metal substituents A – Halogenated bis(metallo) silanes: Several bismetalated silanes [LnM] 2 SiRCl (R = H, Me) have been prepared by stepwise metalation of HSiCl 3 or HSiCl 2 Me with the metalates Na[Fe(CO) 2 Cp] and Li[W(CO) 2 PMe 3 Cp]. Of these metallosilanes further derivatives have been prepared, e. g. the halogenated bis(ferrio) silanes [Cp(OC) 2 Fe] 2 SiX 2 (X = F, Cl, Br, I), some of which could by characterized by X-ray structures. Photochemical CO elimination from these compounds yields µ 2 -silylene bridged complexes of the type [Cp(OC) Fe](µ 2 -CO) (µ 2 SiRHal) (R = Me, halogen). B – Bis(metallo) silanols and –siloxanes: The compounds prepared in chapter A have served as precursors in the synthesis of the novel bis(ferrio) silanols [Cp(OC) 2 Fe] 2 SiX(OH) (X = H, Cl, OH) and the hetero-bismetalated silanol [Cp(OC) 2 Fe][Cp(OC) 2 PMe 3]SiMe(OH). Only [Cp(OC) 2 Fe] 2 SiH(OH) could be prepared via hydrolysis of the respective halogenated bis(ferrio) silane. The other bis(metallo) silanols were prepared by oxygenation of the SiH functional precursors using dimethyldioxirane. All bis(metallo) silanols are stable with respect to self condensation but can be readily converted with ClSiMe 2 H into the siloxanes [LnM] 2 SiR(OSiMe 2 H). C – Co 2 (CO) 8 assisted hydrolysis of silanes: Reaction of various SiH functional silanes R 3 SiH with dicobaltoctacarbonyl leads to the formation of H 2 and the cobaltio-silanes R 3 Si-Co(CO) 4. The Si-Co bond in these metallosilanes is extremely weak and can be easily cleaved by protic solvents. Several cobaltio-silanes including Me 3 SiOSiMe 2 -Co(CO 4), Me(OMe) 2 Si-Co(CO) 4 and Ph 2 SiCo 2 (CO) 7 have been generated and then converted by hydrolysis into silanols or siloxanes. A direct <b>hydrolytic</b> SiH/SiOH <b>transformation</b> can also be achieved in the presence of catalytic amounts of Co 2 (CO) 8. This procedure has been used e. g. for the preparation of the bis(ferrio) siloxanol [Cp(OC) 2 Fe] 2 Si(OH) (OSiMe 2 H). D – DFT calculations of transition metal substituted compounds of silicon and phosphorous: The molecular structure of the dimeric siloxygallanes (RH 2 SiOGaMe 2) 2 (R = H, tBu) has been calculated. A significant dependence of the geometry of the central four membered Ga-O-Ga-O ring on size and relative position of the exocyclic substituents R was found. The calculated structure and NBO analysis of the cyclic metallasiloxane Cp(OC) (H) Fe[SiMe 2 O] 2 SiMe 2 are demonstrating the impact of the Cp(OC) (H) Fe-fragment on structure and bonding within the hetero-siloxane ring. The relative thermodynamic stabilities of the diastereomeric forms of the cationic phosphane complex lk/ul-Cp*(OC) 2 Fe-P(Ph) (H) [CH(CO 2 Me) CH 2 CO 2 Me]+ and the µ 2 -silylene bridged iron complex cis/trans-[Cp(OC) Fe] 2 (µ 2 -CO) (µ 2 -SiH 2) have been calculated...|$|R
