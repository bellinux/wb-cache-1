5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} {{articulate}} a specific campaign platform showed {{that he was trying}} to be <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> all people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E

However, he emphasized the caveat of [...] "opening up more choices for citizens, without imposing on the whole of society". Civic participation may be engaged through debates on policies and national issues, but criticism which [...] "scores political points and undermines the government's standing, {{whether or not this is}} intended" [...] will not be treated lightly.

500|$|Keith Waterhouse's Mrs Pooter's Diary of 1983 is an {{adaptation}} of the Grossmith original that shifts the narrative voice to Carrie Pooter. In 1996 Helen Fielding used the imaginary diary format for Bridget Jones's Diary, which records the daily paraphernalia of a single woman's life. The New York Times critic wrote that it [...] "captures neatly the way modern women teeter between 'I am woman' independence and a pathetic girlie desire to be <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> all men." [...] This diary began as a weekly column in The Independent, and was later published in books which sold more than 15 million copies in 40 countries. In the 1990s the satirical magazine Private Eye lampooned John Major, British prime minister 1990–97, in [...] "The Secret Diary of John Major aged 47", a hybrid of the Adrian Mole diaries with The Diary of a Nobody, which made much fun of Major's lower-middle class origins.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} criticized for its {{large number of}} collaborations and producers.

Anthony Carew of Neumu expressed that the album's fragmentation kept it from being [...] "a bright-and-shiny pop-music [...] ". Most reviewers held that the collaborations prevented the album from having a solidified sound. Eric Greenwood wrote for Drawer B that [...] "Stefani tries to be <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> all people here", but that the result [...] "comes off as manipulative and contrived."

Midas rebukes them, saying [...] "I am a God!". But Midas himself begins to experience the problems of turning everything he touches to gold: he cannot eat, for example. He starts to regret his wish, saying [...] "Oh! fool! to wish to change <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> gold! / Blind Ideot that I was!". Midas prays to Bacchus to take away his power, begging [...] "Make me a hind, clothe me in ragged skins— / And let my food be bread, unsavoury roots, / But take from me the frightful curse of gold". Midas has his courtiers sacrifice to the gods {{to see if he}} can be relieved of his curse; Bacchus relents and tells him to bathe in the river. The courtiers find it strange that he does not remove his crown while he swims; one of them resolves to peek under his crown while he is sleeping. Returning from his swim, Midas celebrates nature, saying gold [...] "is a sordid, base and dirty thing;— / Look at the grass, the sky, the trees, the flowers, / These are Joves treasures & they are not gold".|$|E
500|$|Following the cliffhanger of the first-season finale, Kindler {{worked to}} figure out how to {{conclude}} the story and managed to write the outlines of the first two episodes in two days. He also consulted with the writing team to look at all the problems on how to conclude the story. [...] "Eulogy" [...] was conceived as an important episode in the lives of the main characters following the aftermath of [...] "End of Nights", as well as dealing with the loss of Ashley. Kindler said of the episode [...] "it's one thing to end on a terrible tragic cliffhanger, it's another in a satisfactory manner lay <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> rest appropriately." [...] In writing the episode Cooper was knowledgeable on [...] "medical jargon," [...] as she once wrote for the medical drama series House. In writing his first script [...] "Hero", McCullough was initially concerned that it would be met by resistance from the producers because of the special effects that would be involved, but was [...] "floored" [...] to find out it was entirely possible because of Anthem Visual Effects. The producers were originally hesitant in including [...] "Hero" [...] as the fourth episode, as it was considered lighter in tone as Magnus was trying to get over Ashley's death from [...] "Eulogy". [...] "Pavor Nocturnus" [...] came early in the development of the season, as Kindler wanted to show an episode about Magnus' work going [...] "horribly wrong," [...] and explore the opportunity to have the heroes warned that their work has consequences. Described as the [...] "darkest, scariest, creepiest episode ever" [...] by Tapping, it also featured scenes Kindler was never comfortable with, and did not want to show again, including the assault of naked women, and child killings.|$|E
500|$|It was {{initially}} {{announced that the}} Republican Party {{would go to the}} parliamentary election alone and would seek [...] "qualitative majority" [...] in the parliament, and that their goal was the fairness of the electoral process. Surprisingly for many, on 30 March 1999, Vazgen Sargsyan and the runner-up of the 1998 presidential election and Armenia's ex-communist leader Karen Demirchyan issued a joint announcement that they were forming an alliance between the People's Party of Armenia and the Republican Party. It {{came to be known as}} the Unity bloc («Միասնություն» դաշինք), often referred to as Miasnutyun. Vazgen Sargsyan claimed the bloc was a [...] "genuine" [...] alliance and that the two parties had come together to lead Armenia [...] "from a turning point to progress." [...] When asked about the reasons why he joined Demirchyan, Sargsyan said that, [...] "there is no other way out." [...] According to the U.S. Helsinki Commission, Sargsyan [...] "obviously concluded it was better to have the popular Demirchyan as an ally than an opponent," [...] and that [...] "in forming Unity bloc, Sargsyan and Demirchyan overcame whatever ideological differences they may have had, and said they had joined forces to overcome the difficult problems facing Armenia while promoting tolerance in the country’'s political life." [...] In analyst Richard Giragosian's words, the bloc was [...] "an odd mix," [...] however he admitted that it [...] "effectively marginalized the electoral threat" [...] of other parties. Sociologist Levon Baghdasaryan described it as [...] "unification of the new and old nomenklaturas." [...] The British Helsinki Human Rights Group wrote of the Unity bloc that it [...] "aimed to appeal to the electorate by being <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> all men." [...] The ODIHR suggested that the [...] "alliance was not only created for electoral purposes, but that a strategic political agreement had been reached while overcoming ideological differences." ...|$|E

500|$|Byzantine {{accounts}} of Thomas's rebellion state {{that he did}} not in fact claim the throne under his own name but assumed the identity of Emperor Constantine VI, who had been deposed and murdered by his mother, Irene of Athens, in 797. Most modern scholars follow Lemerle, who dismisses this as yet another later fabrication. If it contains any truth, it is possible that this story may originate from Thomas choosing to be crowned under the regnal name of [...] "Constantine", but there is no evidence for such an act. The possible appropriation of Constantine VI's identity is linked in some Byzantine sources with the statement that Thomas was a rumoured supporter of iconolatry, as opposed to Michael's support for iconoclasm: it was under Constantine VI that veneration of the icons was restored. Nevertheless, the ambiguous phrasing of the sources, the iconoclast leanings of many themes in Asia Minor, and Thomas's alliance with the Arabs seem to speak against any open commitment to icon worship on his part. Indeed, given Michael II's conciliatory approach during his early reign, the icon worship controversy {{does not seem to have}} been a major issue at the time, and in the view of modern scholars most probably did not play a major role in Thomas's revolt. The image of Thomas as an iconophile champion opposed to the iconoclast Michael II in later, Macedonian-era sources was probably the result of their own anti-iconoclast bias. Warren Treadgold furthermore suggests that if true, Thomas's claim to be Constantine VI may have been little more than a tale circulated to win support, and that Thomas pursued a [...] "studied ambiguity" [...] towards icons, designed to attract support from iconophiles. In Treadgold's words, [...] "Thomas could be <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> all men until he had conquered the whole empire, and then he would have time enough to disappoint some of his followers".|$|E
500|$|William III's {{birthday}} fell on 4November, and for orthodox Whigs the {{two days}} therefore became an important double anniversary. [...] William ordered that the thanksgiving service for 5November be amended to include thanks for his [...] "happy arrival" [...] and [...] "the Deliverance of our Church and Nation". In the 1690s he re-established Protestant rule in Ireland, and the Fifth, occasionally marked by the ringing of church bells and civic dinners, was consequently eclipsed by his birthday commemorations. [...] From the 19th century, 5November celebrations there became sectarian in nature. [...] Its celebration in Northern Ireland remains controversial, unlike in Scotland where bonfires continue to be lit in various cities. [...] In England though, as one of 49official holidays, for the ruling class 5November became overshadowed by {{events such as the}} birthdays of Admiral Edward Vernon, or John Wilkes, and under George II and George III, {{with the exception of the}} Jacobite Rising of 1745, it was largely [...] "a polite entertainment rather than an occasion for vitriolic thanksgiving". [...] For the lower classes, however, the anniversary was a chance to pit disorder against order, a pretext for violence and uncontrolled revelry. At some point, for reasons that are unclear, it became customary to burn Guy Fawkes in effigy, rather than the pope. [...] Gradually, Gunpowder Treason Day became Guy Fawkes Day. [...] In 1790 The Times reported instances of children [...] "...begging for money for Guy Faux", and a report of 4November 1802 described how [...] "a set of idle fellows... with some horrid figure dressed up as a Guy Faux" [...] were convicted of begging and receiving money, and committed to prison as [...] "idle and disorderly persons". The Fifth became [...] "a polysemous occasion, replete with polyvalent cross-referencing, meaning <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> all men". [...] Lower class rioting continued, with reports in Lewes of annual rioting, intimidation of [...] "respectable householders" [...] and the rolling through the streets of lit tar barrels. [...] In Guildford, gangs of revellers who called themselves [...] "guys" [...] terrorised the local population; proceedings were concerned more with the settling of old arguments and general mayhem, than any historical reminiscences. [...] Similar problems arose in Exeter, originally the scene of more traditional celebrations. [...] In 1831 an effigy was burnt of the new Bishop of Exeter Henry Phillpotts, a High Church Anglican and High Tory who opposed Parliamentary reform, and who was also suspected of being involved in [...] "creeping popery". [...] A local ban on fireworks in 1843 was largely ignored, and attempts by the authorities to suppress the celebrations resulted in violent protests and several injured constables.|$|E
