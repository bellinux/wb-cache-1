During those final two hours, Jennings played artists such as Chuck Berry and Little Richard. The owner reprimanded him each time he aired the recordings, and when he then played two Richard records in a row, the owner fired him.|$|E

5|$|Ritchie Valens, {{who once}} had a fear of flying, asked Tommy Allsup for his seat on the plane. The two agreed to toss a coin to decide. Bob Hale, <b>a</b> <b>DJ</b> with KRIB-AM, was working the concert that night and flipped the coin in the ballroom's side-stage room shortly before the musicians {{departed}} for the airport. Valens won the coin toss for the seat on the flight.|$|E
5|$|Several {{versions}} of the stage were used during the tour. The first two legs of 1992 were indoors and used {{the smallest of the}} sets, which included fourVidiwalls (Philips-branded giant television screens); sixpainted Trabants suspended above the stage; 36television monitors; and a B-stage, a small remote platform connected to the main stage by a ramp. A seventh Trabant by the B-stage doubled as <b>a</b> <b>DJ</b> booth and a mirror ball.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, {{the album}} {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. However, it achieved moderate commercial success because its sound was aimed {{more at the}} underground rave scene audience, and failed to enter the Billboard 200. It is currently out of print. During {{the promotion of the}} album, Lords performed as <b>a</b> <b>DJ</b> and opened shows for other artists such as Moby and the band My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult.|$|E

5|$|A {{retrospective}} study {{carried out at}} an Auckland emergency department found that BZP presentations only made a minor contribution to their overdose database with most cases not producing any significant toxicity. Several cases where BZP individually or combined with alcohol or other medicines or illicit drugs resulting in complications exist. One such example is the well publicised case {{of a combination of}} BZP and MDMA by a 23-year-old from Greymouth, New Zealand. Ben Rodham, <b>a</b> <b>DJ,</b> ingested a combination of BZP and MDMA in February 2007, which nearly resulted in his death. Rodham was put into an induced coma in an effort to prevent him from dying. He later recovered.|$|E
5|$|According to <b>a</b> <b>DJ</b> Premier fan blog, The Source's {{website and}} other sites, DJ Kool Herc fell gravely ill in early 2011 and {{was said to}} lack health insurance. He had surgery for kidney stones, with a stent placed to relieve the pressure. He needed {{follow-up}} surgery but St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, the site that performed the previous surgery, has requested that he make a deposit toward the next surgery, because he has missed several follow-up visits. The hospital {{said it would not}} turn away uninsured patients in the emergency room. DJ Kool Herc and his family set up an official website on which he describes his medical issue and the larger goal of establishing the DJ Kool Herc Fund to pioneer long-term health care solutions. In April 2013, Campbell recovered from surgery and moved into post-medical care.|$|E
5|$|Coexist is the 2012 second studio album by English indie pop {{band the}} xx.

5|$|DJ Hero was {{generally}} well received by game journalists, praising the {{departure from the}} Guitar Hero series-style of gameplay, {{the use of the}} turntable controller to simulate the motions of <b>a</b> <b>DJ</b> and how the game's difficulty curve helps the player to become skilled on it, and the game's soundtrack; several smaller issues were identified as potential improvements for a possible sequel. However, the game did not perform as strongly as expected by industry analysts, believed to be due to the waning interest in music games during 2009; regardless, DJ Hero is stated by NPD Group to be the highest-grossing new intellectual property of 2009 in North America.|$|E
5|$|Dan Ferreira {{is a fan}} of Elvis Presley, {{portrayed as}} a womaniser and a bully. He claims to be a widower, talking about his wife as being dead, both to the {{neighbours}} and his children, but they have merely separated after she had an affair with his best friend, with whom she moved in. Ash is portrayed as the intelligent member of the family, the standard of his education being much higher than his siblings, so much so that he is a lecturer. He has an on/off problem with gambling, something that presumably led to the breakup of his first marriage, before he is seen on screen. Kareena is in a relationship with Tariq, though it is not a sexual one. Ronny works as <b>a</b> <b>DJ</b> under the name DJ Ronny Flawless, and Tariq is his best friend and promoter.|$|E

5|$|On 13 September 1964, Epstein {{approached}} Harry {{to create}} a national music paper, so Harry coined the name Music Echo, and gradually merged Mersey Beat into it. Epstein had promised Harry full editorial control, but then hired a female press officer in London to write a fashion column and <b>a</b> <b>D.J.</b> to write a gossip column, without informing Harry of his intentions, leaving Harry with no other option but to resign. The paper subsequently ran into financial problems, and Epstein had to merge it with another paper, becoming the Disc & Music Echo. When Harry and his wife moved to London in 1966, he was already contributing a column for the magazine Weekend and also for the teen magazines Marilyn and Valentine. He then became the feature writer, news editor and columnist for Record Mirror (using various pseudonyms such as 'Brenda Tarry' and 'David Berglas'), and wrote features for Music Now (under the name of Nick Blaine) for Record Retailer.|$|E
5|$|The band Pylon was {{a long-standing}} and {{influential}} {{part of the}} Athens scene, and became critical darlings in the 1980s, but never achieved significant mainstream success. This was partially because they eschewed several record contracts from the major labels {{due to a lack}} of trust in their corporate goodwill. Pylon's dance rock style was not very accessible or commercial, and was accompanied grating, chanting-style vocals, funky guitars and bass-heavy beats. Other 1980s local bands with nationwide alternative followings included Love Tractor, Oh-OK, with Michael Stipe's sister Lynda Stipe, vocalist Linda Hopper (later of Magnapop) and future solo performer Matthew Sweet, Dreams So Real. The members of R.E.M. have remained fixtures in Athens as they have also become international stars, helping out local performers like Vic Chesnutt, the Chickasaw Mudd Puppies and Jack Logan. The Elephant 6 Collective, a group of like-minded indie bands, gained limited nationwide exposure starting in the mid-1990s with the rise of Neutral Milk Hotel, Elf Power and Olivia Tremor Control. The same period saw the Kindercore Records roster find critical acclaim, including the bands Sunshine Fix, Masters of the Hemisphere, Japancakes, Love Tractor, Gresham Disco and Of Montreal. Candy, <b>a</b> <b>DJ</b> store owned by Michael Lachowski of Pylon, opened in 1998; the store became an important part of the burgeoning dance music scene that produced Danger Mouse, Phungus and DJ 43.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} premièred on August 26, 2010 on Vevo, and was {{directed}} by Hiro Murai. The video begins in a club environment, with misplaced furniture and a shattered glass bottle. The scene goes in reverse motion, people instantly appear, frozen in a raving action. As the scene is still reversing <b>a</b> <b>DJ</b> is spinning his booth, and the shattered glass bottle forms into its original state, the clubbers and the scene then start to move in forward but slow motion and the song begins with Usher approaching from a set of stairs. Usher sings and dances, whilst moving past clubbers who are still moving in slow motion whilst he is in moving normally. Once the chorus comes in, the clubbers begin dancing and raving in normal motion, periodically slowing down; Usher is krumping pass them, {{moving on to the}} next scene. Usher slides into a room with a large lit up window as a back drop. He performs choreography backed-up by female dancers for the second verse, and then returns to the original room with the second chorus coming in. A similar scene is involved to the first chorus, but this time Usher is dancing with the clubbers, who are still alternating in motion speed. Pitbull then begins his verse, and is sat in a V.I.P. area with three females, with the camera alternating between him, the clubbers and Usher. The video ends with its final scene, in a dance off, with Usher dancing adjacent to some of the clubbers. Once the climax of the chorus comes in, Usher jumps in the air and starts freely dancing along with the clubbers, with everyone in the same motion speed; Usher is primarily crip-walking. Usher and the clubbers then perform a final organised choreography, mainly krumping, and the video ends.|$|E
