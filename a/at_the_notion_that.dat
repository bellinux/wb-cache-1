We conduct our investigation in the standard failures-divergences CSP process model, formulating a suitable implementation relation between the observable behaviours of the implementation and the target process. Interface difference and bridging is modelled by endowing the implementation relation with parameters, called extraction patterns, instrumental to interpreting implementation behaviour as target behaviour. Reasonable notions of implementation and extraction patterns should result in a relation satisfying the realisability and compositionality properties. The former means that, if target and implementation in fact have the same interface, then th...|$|R
