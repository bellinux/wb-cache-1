500|$|The {{damage done}} by Sherman was almost entirely limited to the {{destruction}} of property. Though exact figures are not available, the loss of civilian life appears to have been very small. Consuming supplies, wrecking infrastructure, and undermining morale were Sherman's stated goals, and several of his Southern contemporaries noted this and commented on it. For instance, Alabama-born Major Henry Hitchcock, who served in Sherman's staff, declared that [...] "it is <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> consume and destroy the sustenance of thousands of people," [...] but if the scorched earth strategy served [...] "to paralyze their husbands and fathers who are fighting ... it is mercy in the end".|$|E
2500|$|The Ministry song [...] "Burning Inside" [...] (from {{the album}} The Mind Is <b>a</b> <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>To</b> Taste) {{features}} an audio {{sample of the}} military station's warning horn and a few notes of composer John Harrison's synthesized score.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will try, sir. I will indeed," [...] Richard said earnestly; and {{he spoke}} from his heart, for the {{inheritance}} was very dear to him, {{and it would be}} <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> indeed <b>to</b> forfeit it.|$|R
60|$|As he lay groaning in bed, Mr. Jennings {{went in to}} see him {{and tried}} to relieve the old man's {{feelings}} by telling him the number of times he had practically cut his feet off, and said he knew it was <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> hard <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> put up with.|$|R
60|$|The {{effect of}} this {{declaration}} upon its hearers was remarkable. Peter's jaw dropped, and {{for the second time}} that day his face went white; while Margaret sank down into a chair that stood near by, and stared at him helplessly. In those times it was <b>a</b> very <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> Jew. Castell looked from one to the other, and, feeling the insult of their silence, grew angry.|$|R
2500|$|Ministry found {{mainstream}} {{success in}} the late 1980s and early 1990s with the albums The Land of Rape and Honey (1988), The Mind Is <b>a</b> <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>to</b> Taste (1989) and [...] (1992), with the former of the two certified gold and the latter certified platinum by the RIAA. The band has been nominated for six Grammy Awards, and performed at several notable music festivals, including participating in the second annual Lollapalooza tour in 1992 and co-headlining Big Day Out in 1995.|$|E
2500|$|This period {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of divisions within the band, as rather than tour in support of Rabies, Ogre joined Ministry while they toured in support of their album The Mind Is <b>a</b> <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>to</b> Taste; Ogre contributed guitars, keyboards, and vocals during the tour. Ogre had also began working with the Ministry side project Revolting Cocks. [...] Key was later quoted as saying of Ogre's involvement with Ministry and, later on, Martin Atkins' Pigface that he sometimes felt [...] "like a wife that's been cheated on".|$|E
2500|$|... "Knock Knock" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Missy Elliott for Mass Confusion Productions, with additional production by Kanye West. Lee Hatim is also credited {{in the song}} because it contains excerpts from The Masquerader' 1975 single, [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>to</b> Waste Your Love." [...] West previously sampled the track in his own demo recording, [...] "Apologize", which was later released on his 2005 mixtape Freshmen Adjustment. [...] "Knock Knock" [...] was recorded by Carlos Bedoya at The Hit Factory Criteria in Miami, Florida with further assistance from Marcella Araica. Scott Kieklak mixed the song, while mastering was overseen by Tom Coyne. Elliott also provided additional vocals.|$|E

5000|$|During the battle, American {{soldiers}} {{found it}} difficult to distinguish civilians from soldiers. It became common for them to shoot at Okinawan houses, as one infantryman wrote: There was some return fire from a few of the houses, but the others were probably occupied by civilians - and we didn't care. It was <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> not <b>to</b> distinguish between the enemy and women and children. Americans always had great compassion, especially for children. Now we fired indiscriminately.|$|R
2500|$|The follow-up, The Mind Is <b>a</b> <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>to</b> Taste was {{supported}} by a tour from 1989 to 1990. Due to the complex nature of the album's drumming, a second drummer, Martin Atkins, was used. In addition to Atkins, a ten piece touring line-up was formed, consisting of Chris Connelly (keyboards and vocals), Nivek Ogre (vocals and keyboards), Joe Kelly (vocals and backing vocals) and guitarists Mike Scaccia, Terry Roberts, and William Tucker, with Jourgensen, Barker and Rieflin serving as the group's core members. This tour was documented on In Case You Didn't Feel Like Showing Up. Two singles, [...] "Burning Inside" [...] (for which a video was made) and [...] "So What" [...] were released from the album.|$|E
2500|$|... "Knock Knock" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Monica, taken from her fourth studio album After the Storm (2003). It was written and produced by rapper-producer Missy Elliott and commissioned following the delay and subsequent reconstruction of Monica's 2002 album, All Eyez on Me. One out {{of a handful of}} tracks which Elliott contributed, the song incorporates elements of 1970s-style soul and quiet storm, as well as hip hop, and is built around excerpts of the record [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>to</b> Waste Your Love" [...] as written by Lee Hatim and released by The Masqueraders in 1976. Rapper Kanye West, whose 2005 Freshmen Adjustment mixtape recording [...] "Apologize" [...] the track is based on, is listed as the song's co-producer.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{his time}} as vice president, Quayle was widely {{ridiculed}} {{in the media and}} by many in the general public, both in the U.S. and overseas, as an intellectual lightweight and generally incompetent. Contributing greatly to the perception of Quayle's incompetence was his tendency to make public statements that were either self-contradictory ("The Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation's history. ... No, not our nation's, but in World War II. I mean, we all lived in this century. I didn't live in this century, but in this century's history"), self-contradictory and confused ("I have made good judgments in the past. I have made good judgments in the future") or just confused (such as his address to the United Negro College Fund, whose slogan is [...] "A mind is <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> waste," [...] where he said [...] "You take the UNCF model that what a waste it is to lose one's mind or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is.") ...|$|E

5000|$|D'Austria {{requested}} {{that her parents}} allow her to return. When her father refused, d'Austria put him in prison. After five weeks, the father relented and Markéta returned. On Monday, 18 February 1608, d'Austria murdered Markéta and disfigured her body. Březan recorded the event: [...] "On the 18th of February, Julius, that awful tyrant and devil, bastard of the Emperor, did <b>an</b> incredibly <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> his bed partner, {{the daughter of a}} barber, when he cut off her head and other parts of her body, and people had to put her into her coffin in single pieces." ...|$|R
2500|$|Templer {{remained}} with the battalion until mid-October 1917 when, now aged 19, {{he was sent}} to the 7th/8th (Service) Battalion on the Western Front. The battalion was a Kitchener's Army unit serving as part of the 49th Brigade of the 16th (Irish) Division. However, he was posted to 'C' Company of the 1st Battalion in mid-November a Regular Army unit, then serving in the 107th Brigade of the 36th (Ulster) Division. Soon after Templer's arrival, the battalion took part in the Battle of Cambrai in late November, although Templer himself took no part in the battle and the battalion, and his 'C' Company in particular, sustained heavy losses. In early February 1918 Templer's battalion, the 1st Irish Fusiliers, was transferred to the 108th Brigade, due to a severe manpower shortage in the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, which necessitated the reduction of all British brigades from four to three battalions. He was promoted to lieutenant on 16 February 1918. On 20 March Templer, seriously ill, passed out while in the trenches, suffering from acute diphtheria, and he was later evacuated to England. The German Army launched their Spring Offensive the day after and, while he was away his battalion sustained over 770 casualties out of a strength of some 800 men. He returned to the battalion in , now composed of mainly teenagers, and fought with it in the Hundred Days Offensive, which saw the war turn in favour of the Allies and eventually resulted in the Armistice with Germany being signed and the war ending on 11 November 1918. Templer was considerably lucky during the war, having not been wounded, although, as with many others of his generation, it left its mark on him in other ways. He wrote, many years later, [...] "I still sometimes in my sleep at night hear the screams of the wounded horses, galloping on the ground, tripping over barbed wire, and treading on their own guts. It was <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> have to witness, worse in some ways than the human casualties". A week before his death Templer had this dream again, over sixty years after the war.|$|E

60|$|It is <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>a</b> very <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{have to run}} for one's life. Peter Rabbit {{knows all}} about it. He has run for his life often. Sometimes it has been Reddy Fox behind him, {{sometimes}} Bowser the Hound, and once or twice Old Man Coyote. Peter has known that on his long legs his life has depended, and more than once <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> fear has filled his heart. But Peter has also known {{that if he could}} reach the old stone wall or the dear Old Briar-patch first, he would be safe, and he always has reached it. So when he has been running with that terrible fear in his heart, there has always been hope there, too.|$|R
