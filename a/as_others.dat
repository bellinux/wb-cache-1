5|$|Despite {{numerous}} mistakes, Villani often displayed an insider's {{knowledge on}} many subjects, {{as a result}} of his extensive travels and access to both official and private documents. For example, De Vries states that he wrote one of the most accurate accounts of the Battle of Crécy during the Hundred Years' War, including information that the archers were placed precariously behind the English and Welsh infantry, not on the flanks <b>as</b> <b>others</b> asserted. While describing detailed events unfolding within the city, Villani would name every individual street, square, bridge, family, and person involved, assuming his readers would have the same intimate knowledge of Florence as he did.|$|E

Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object. Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness.

5|$|Parseghian {{quickly turned}} things around in 1964, re-establishing {{a sense of}} {{confidence}} and team spirit that had been lost under Kuharich and Devore. Practices were carefully planned and organized {{with the help of}} a coaching staff that consisted of three assistants from Northwestern and four former Notre Dame players. Parseghian listened to players' concerns about the program and addressed them. He updated the team's offense by favoring passing and bringing in smaller and quicker players. A rule change allowing unlimited substitutions starting in 1964 helped make this strategy successful; fast-running receivers could now be taken out of the game and rested <b>as</b> <b>others</b> replaced them.|$|E

5|$|When Barnhart {{revised the}} family Lentibulariaceae in 1916, he {{recognized}} six {{species in the}} section Orcheosanthus, admitting however that this number was likely to change <b>as</b> <b>others</b> studied the section in the future. Sprague in 1928 proposed that the species joined by Hemsley were probably distinct, but that they were likely so interrelated that distinguishing between them would require observing characteristics that were usually or always indistinct in dried specimens. Sprague recognized eight species in the section: P. moranensis H.B.K, P. caudata Schltdl., P. oblongiloba, P. flos-mulionis, P. bakeriana, a P. moranensis-like P. rosei described by Watson in 1911, and the very distinct P. gypsicola.|$|E

After an early education in Edinburgh she boarded at St Leonards School and St Katharines School for Girls in St Andrews {{on the east}} coast of Scotland. She returned to enroll at the University of Edinburgh in October 1892. Among the first female students there, she was not the first to graduate, <b>as</b> <b>others</b> were more advanced in their studies when they entered as graduate students, and earned Master's degrees before she finished her undergraduate work. Macmillan studied science subjects including Honours Mathematics with George Chrystal, Astronomy with Ralph Copeland, and Natural Philosophy with Peter Guthrie Tait and Cargill Gilston Knott. She earned her Bachelor of Science degree in April 1896, the first woman at Edinburgh to do so.|$|E
5|$|Heliade began {{a career}} as a civil servant after the Postelnicie {{commissioned}} him to print the Official Bulletin, and later climbed through the official hierarchy, eventually serving as Clucer. This rise coincided with the establishment of the Regulamentul Organic regime, inaugurated, upon the end of the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, by an Imperial Russian administration under Pavel Kiselyov. When Kiselyov placed an order with Heliade for the printing of official documents, including the Regulament, the writer and his family were made prosperous by the sales. Nevertheless, Heliade maintained contacts with the faction of reformist boyars: in 1833, together with Ion Câmpineanu, Iancu Văcărescu, Ioan Voinescu II, Constantin Aristia, Ştefan and Nicolae Golescu, as well <b>as</b> <b>others,</b> he founded the short-lived Soţietatea Filarmonică (the Philharmonic Society), which advanced a cultural agenda (and was especially active in raising funds for the National Theater of Wallachia). Aside from its stated cultural goals, Soţietatea Filarmonică continued a covert political activity.|$|E
5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as when an {{individual}} attempts to present an acceptable image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally (480). This definition is based on Goffman’s idea that individuals see themselves <b>as</b> <b>others</b> view them, so in essence they attempt {{to see themselves as}} if they are outside looking in (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover the subtle ways humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal.|$|E

5|$|People {{relive the}} Wild West both {{historically}} and {{in popular culture}} by participating in cowboy action shooting events, where each gunslinger adopts {{his or her own}} look representing a character from Western life in the late 1800s, and as part of that character, chooses an alias to go by. The sport originated in Southern California, USA, in the early 1980s but is now practiced in many places with several sanctioning organizations including the Single Action Shooting Society (SASS), Western Action Shootists Association (WASA), and National Congress of Old West Shooters (NCOWS), as well <b>as</b> <b>others</b> in the USA and in other countries. There are different categories shooters can compete in. There's the gunfighter, frontiersman, classic cowboy and duelist - each with its own specifications.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra was {{the first}} {{commanding}} officer of the Regiment of Patricians created after the ill-fated British invasions of the Río de la Plata. The increased militarization {{of the city and}} the relaxation of the system of castas allowed him, as other criollo peoples, to become a prominent figure in local politics. His intervention was decisive to thwart the Mutiny of Álzaga and allow Viceroy Santiago de Liniers to stay in power. Although he supported the establishment of a government Junta, <b>as</b> <b>others</b> created in Spain during the contemporary Peninsular War, he desired that criollos had an important role in it (the mutiny of Álzaga was promoted by peninsulars). He advised against rushed actions as well, and as his Regiment was crucial in any action against the viceroy, he denied his help until it was a good strategic moment to do so. The opportunity came in May, 1810, and the May Revolution successfully ousted the viceroy.|$|E

Phil is devastated to find her body, and a letter from her urges him to love himself <b>as</b> <b>others</b> love him. Peggy's funeral takes place on 4 July 2016, and Phil is due to do a eulogy to her there but gets too emotional and runs home.

Phil later works up the courage to finish his eulogy to Peggy at the wake, and then returns to her grave at the church to finish his goodbyes to her, unaware that Grant has secretly left a rose at the grave.|$|E
5|$|The {{frame of}} the {{building}} was constructed from reinforced concrete, which was then clad in Portland stone. Several highly detailed sculptures adorn {{the outside of the}} building, including ones of Britannia and Neptune, as well <b>as</b> <b>others</b> representing peace, war, and storms. There are also sculptures of the Zodiac and the coat of arms of the United Kingdom's allies during the First World War. Another series of sculptures on the building depict different races from around the world, which reflect the global operations of the Cunard company. Marble was used to furnish several parts of the inside of the building, particularly on the ground floor corridors that link the north and south entrances. It was imported from several locations in Italy and Greece, including Attica, Carrara, and Arni Alto.|$|E
5|$|The route {{went through}} more {{mountains}} in the fifth stage. With large amounts of rain, the peloton made a truce and the stage saw few attacks. A three-man breakaway formed with around twelve kilometers to go. The riders stayed together and all sprinted for the stage win, which was originally won by Roberto Pagnin; however, due to his non-linear sprint line that interfered with the two other riders, he was relegated to second place and the original second-place finisher, Emanuele Bombini, was promoted and declared winner. The next day of racing ended with a bunch sprint won by Frank Hoste, but a crash with two kilometers to go from the finish saw general classification contenders Visentini and Saronni, as well <b>as</b> <b>others,</b> lose twenty seconds. The seventh stage saw a six-man breakaway survive and finish ahead of the peloton by almost two minutes as Orlando Maini won the day.|$|E
