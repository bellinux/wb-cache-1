5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was controlled by}} a fighter-type control stick and rudder bar which operated the powered flying controls (PFCs). Each PFC had a single electro-hydraulic powered flying control unit (PFCU) except the rudder which had two, one running as a back-up. <b>Artificial</b> <b>feel</b> and autostabilisation {{in the form of}} pitch and yaw dampers were provided, as well as an auto mach trimmer.|$|E
25|$|The SA.4 was {{designed}} for a crew of five: pilot, copilot, bombardier ("air bomber"), navigator and radio operator. The prone bombardier's position was a tube extending forward of the cockpit above the radome; the crew compartment being pressurized. These positions were fitted with opaque nosecones, as the Sperrins were never used for live bombing. The pilot was {{the only member of}} the crew to have a Martin-Baker-produced ejector seat underneath a jettisonable roof panel; other crew members were intended to bail out via a door located under the navigator's console. The other three crew positions were located behind the pilots, facing rearwards. Unusually, the pilot's flying controls lacked any direct connection to the aircraft's flight control surfaces, control input was instead directed into a gearbox to actuate rotatable ball-screw jacks to move each flight surface via aerodynamic load instead; a corresponding <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> system was also installed. Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist describe the control system as having been simple, light, reliable, and low-friction and contrast it positively against powered systems of the era.|$|E
500|$|The Victor had fully {{duplicated}} powered controls; many of {{the flight}} controls and flight surfaces were designed with redundancies. Pilot control movements were transmitted via a low-friction mechanical system. This setup was developed to provide, amongst other capabilities, a level of <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> to the pilot. Eight separated hydraulic circuits were present on the aircraft, which comprised the alighting gear, flaps, nose flaps, air brakes, bomb doors, wheel brakes, nose-wheel steering, and the ram-air turbine scoops. An AC electrical system and auxiliary power unit were significant additions upon the later Victor B.2, electrical reliability being noticeably improved.|$|E

500|$|Originally the BBC was {{the sole}} {{producer}} of Persuasion, until it partnered with the American company WGBH Boston and the French company Millesime. This decision gave the production a larger budget and allowed it to be filmed at locations featured in the novel, including Lyme Regis and Bath. Michell believed this was Austen's most emotional and poignant novel, {{as well as her}} most autobiographical. While directing, he avoided what he felt was the polished, <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> of other 19th-century depictions, and discouraged his actors from wearing make-up or appearing too hygienic. Costume designer Alexandra Byrne produced clothing that appeared [...] "lived-in", winning a BAFTA for her efforts.|$|E
500|$|The primary flight {{controls}} of the Tornado are a fly-by-wire hybrid, consisting of an analogue [...] Command and Stability Augmentation System (CSAS) {{connected to a}} digital Autopilot & Flight Director System (AFDS); in addition a level of mechanical reversion capacity was retained to safeguard against potential failure. To enhance pilot awareness, <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> was built into the {{flight controls}}, such as the centrally located stick; because of the Tornado's variable wings enabling the aircraft to drastically alter its flight envelope, the artificial responses adjust automatically to wing profile changes and other changes to flight attitude. As a large variety of munitions and stores can be outfitted, the resulting changes to the aircraft's flight dynamics are routinely compensated for by the flight stability system.|$|E
500|$|The inquiry's {{recommendations}} {{revolved around}} the enforcement of stricter speed limits during turbulence, and two significant design changes also resulted: all Comets were equipped with weather radar and the [...] "Q feel" [...] system was introduced, which ensured that control column forces (invariably called stick forces) would be proportional to control loads. This <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> {{was the first of}} its kind to be introduced in any aircraft. [...] The Comet 1 and 1A had been criticised for a lack of [...] "feel" [...] in their controls, [...] and investigators suggested that this might have contributed to the pilot's alleged over-stressing of the aircraft; Comet chief test pilot John Cunningham contended, however, that the jetliner flew smoothly and was highly responsive in a manner consistent with other de Havilland aircraft.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: TRW has {{recently}} launched an electrically powered, computer-controlled enhance-ment to commercial vehicle steering systems. ColumnDrive, the new component, precisely controls torque {{feedback to the}} driver, resulting in a synthetic or <b>artificial</b> steering <b>feel.</b> Synthetic torque feedback is most effective at masking non-linearities in the steering system that degrade the on-centre lane-keeping properties of the vehicle, {{as well as providing}} an unprecedented level of speed proportionality so that parking efforts can be optimized independently of on-centre stability. The new ColumnDrive and existing electrical power-steering control architectures are compared, and actual vehicle performance data are presented...|$|R
50|$|In {{this power}} {{steering}} system, the force steering the wheels {{comes from the}} car's high pressure hydraulic system and {{is always the same}} no matter what the road speed is. Turning the steering wheel moves the wheels simultaneously to a corresponding angle via a hydraulic cylinder. In order to give some <b>artificial</b> steering <b>feel,</b> there is a separate hydraulically operated system that tries to turn the steering wheel back to centre position. The amount of pressure applied is proportional to road speed, so that at low speeds the steering is very light, and at high speeds {{it is very difficult to}} move more than a small amount off centre.|$|R
25|$|The c-examples {{are cases}} of {{preposition}} stranding, which {{is possible in}} English, but not allowed in many languages {{that are related to}} English. For instance, preposition stranding is largely absent from many of the other Germanic languages and it may be completely absent from the Romance languages. Prescriptive grammars often claim that preposition stranding should be avoided in English as well; however, in certain contexts pied-piping of prepositions in English may make a sentence <b>feel</b> <b>artificial</b> or stilted.|$|R
500|$|Test {{pilot and}} naval aviator Captain Eric Brown {{evaluated}} the first prototype and found [...] "the controls in cruising flight were very heavy and, in fact, lateral control was so solid that I could barely move the ailerons {{with one hand}} at [...]" [...] In bad weather a pilot circling a carrier while waiting to land would {{have been forced to}} fly such a wide circuit that he could not always keep the carrier in sight. The later prototypes had ailerons boosted by hydraulic power and <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> to the stick from a spring, as an interim measure but Brown found [...] "the second prototype was much less the pleasant aircraft to fly as the stick continually hunted either side of neutral and there was no build up of stick force with increase in speed." [...] The Spearfish lacked any sort of stall warning, which would have been a problem in operational use as the stall and approach speeds were fairly close. For the landing, the aircraft proved quite docile.|$|E
500|$|Michell {{attempted}} {{to be as}} faithful to the novel as possible, in particular avoiding what he felt was the polished, <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> of other period dramas set in the 19th-century. The director explained, [...] "I was desperately {{trying to make it}} feel like it could be happening in the next room. I tried to make it something which is absolutely about real people and not about dressing or hairstyles or carpet". Consequently, because he felt the realistic look of the age would make the film more dramatic, Michell chose to depict the actors without make-up, and disallowed them from looking too hygienic. Root commented about the film's natural look in an interview, [...] "I basically didn't wear any makeup , and my hair was obviously set in a very unflattering way... I suppose the lighting was quite harsh, as well. None of us looked good". She said in a separate interview, [...] "I wanted to make Anne Elliot a somewhat plain woman who was not really miserable but had found a way to be content somehow, and yet emotions are buzzing around her all the time". Root believed the film's realistic depiction of the age was a key aspect of its appeal.|$|E
2500|$|The Delta 2 had a {{relatively}} small cockpit, in which the single pilot was housed, which had little room for the installation of additional equipment. The Delta was the first British aircraft to fly using all-powered controls. These controls, designed and produced by Fairey, were fully duplicated. The flight control system was hydraulically operated and possessed no mechanical backup. Fairey had recently developed a new high-pressure hydraulic system and this {{was used in the}} design. The hydraulics provided no feedback or [...] "feel" [...] to the pilot's controls, so another system providing <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> was necessary.|$|E
50|$|Some {{researchers}} {{are concerned that}} experiments testing for fast mapping are produced in <b>artificial</b> settings. They <b>feel</b> that fast mapping doesn't occur as often in more real life, natural situations.

For some, testing to see if the child can use the new word in a different situation constitutes true knowledge of a word, rather than simply identifying the new word.|$|R
5000|$|It {{received}} a positive review and received 3.5/5 stars from Allmusic, who wrote [...] "pitched {{somewhere between the}} Postal Service's indie electronica and the bedsit romanticism of Belle & Sebastian or the Clientele, Painting Over the Dirt fuses smart, melodic pop songwriting to a melancholy worldview exemplified by Wolferman's barely there vocals and minor-key tunes."

5000|$|Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times {{called the}} film [...] "one of those movies that {{presents}} life precisely and meticulously as it isn't, presumably {{as some kind}} of consolation for how it really is" [...] and added, [...] "With its simplistic compartmentalization of dueling personality types, kindergarten view of grown-up love, exquisite styling, overripe camera moves and lousy, overwrought score, the movie feels stubbornly, resolutely disingenuous and one-dimensional. Everything in it is designed to make you feel better, so why does it <b>feel</b> <b>artificial</b> and palliative in that really depressing way?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The Tornado ADV's {{differences}} {{compared to}} the IDS include a greater sweep angle on the wing gloves, and the deletion of their kruger flaps, deletion of the port cannon, a longer radome for the Foxhunter radar, slightly longer airbrakes and a fuselage stretch of 1.36m to allow the carriage of four Skyflash semi-active radar homing missiles. The stretch {{was applied to the}} Tornado front fuselage being built by the UK, with a plug being added immediately behind the cockpit, which had the unexpected benefit of reducing drag and making space for an additional fuel tank (Tank '0') carrying [...] of fuel. The <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> of the flight controls was lighter on the ADV than on the IDS. Various internal avionics, pilot displays, guidance systems and software also differed; including an automatic wing sweep selector not fitted to the strike aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|With purely {{mechanical}} {{flight control}} systems, the aerodynamic {{forces on the}} control surfaces are transmitted through the mechanisms and are felt directly by the pilot, allowing tactile feedback of airspeed. With hydromechanical flight control systems, however, the load on the surfaces cannot be felt {{and there is a}} risk of overstressing the aircraft through excessive control surface movement. To overcome this problem, <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> systems can be used. For example, for the controls of the RAF's Avro Vulcan jet bomber and the RCAF's Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow supersonic interceptor (both 1950s-era designs), the required force feedback was achieved by a spring device. [...] The fulcrum of this device was moved in proportion to the square of the air speed (for the elevators) to give increased resistance at higher speeds. For the controls of the American Vought F-8 Crusader and the LTV A-7 Corsair II warplanes, a 'bob-weight' was used in the pitch axis of the control stick, giving force feedback that was proportional to the airplane's normal acceleration.|$|E

2500|$|Kurzweil {{concedes that}} every {{technology}} {{carries with it}} the risk of misuse or abuse, from viruses and nanobots to out-of-control AI machines. He believes the only countermeasure is to invest in defensive technologies, for example by allowing new genetics and medical treatments, monitoring for dangerous pathogens, and creating limited moratoriums on certain technologies. As for <b>artificial</b> intelligence Kurzweil <b>feels</b> the best defense {{is to increase the}} [...] "values of liberty, tolerance, and respect for knowledge and diversity" [...] in society, because [...] "the nonbiological intelligence will be embedded in our society and will reflect our values".|$|R
5000|$|Conversely, {{the series}} has also {{received}} criticism over its portrayal of teen angst. Mike Hale of The New York Times wrote a critical review, writing, [...] "the show doesn't make Hannah's downward progress convincing.

[...] He also criticized the plot device that has Clay listening to the tapes one by one instead of all in one sitting like the other teens did, which Hale felt was unbelievable: [...] "It makes no sense as anything but a plot device, and you'll find yourself, like Clay's antagonists, yelling at him {{to listen to the}} rest of tapes already." ...|$|R

40|$|Summary. We present several models {{concerning}} {{the short term}} consequences of spreading offspring in varying environments. Our goal is to determine what patterns of spatial and temporal variation yield an advantage to increasing scale of dispersal. Of necessity, the models are somewhat <b>artificial</b> but we <b>feel</b> they are a reasonable approximation f and hence generalizable to natural systems. With these models we examine consequences of dispersal arising from environmental variation: increased en-vironmental variance, different degrees of spatial and temporal correlation, some arbitrary spatial patterns of favorability and finally some patterns derived from long-term, large-scale weather data collected along a contiguous stretch of coastline from south-ern Oregon to northern Washington (USA). We examine {{the costs and benefits}} of increasing scale of dispersal in both density dependent and density independent models...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} how upper limb amputees {{can be made}} to experience a rubber hand as part of their own body. This was accomplished by applying synchronous touches to the stump, which was out of view, and to the index finger of a rubber hand, placed in full view (26 cm medial to the stump). This elicited an illusion of sensing touch on the artificial hand, rather than on the stump and a feeling of ownership of the rubber hand developed. This effect was supported by quantitative subjective reports in the form of questionnaires, behavioural data in the form of misreaching in a pointing task when asked to localize the position of the touch, and physiological evidence obtained by skin conductance responses when threatening the hand prosthesis. Our findings outline a simple method for transferring tactile sensations from the stump to a prosthetic limb by tricking the brain, thereby making an important contribution to the field of neuroprosthetics where a major goal is to develop <b>artificial</b> limbs that <b>feel</b> like a real parts of the body...|$|R
