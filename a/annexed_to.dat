5|$|Albany's {{other major}} exports during the 18th and 19th centuries were furs, wheat, meat, and lumber; by 1865, there were almost 4,000 saw mills in the Albany {{area and the}} Albany Lumber District was the largest lumber market in the nation. The city was also home {{to a number of}} banks. The Bank of Albany (1792–1861) was the second {{chartered}} bank in New York. The city was the original home of the Albank (founded in 1820 as the Albany Savings Bank), KeyBank (founded in 1825 as the Commercial Bank of Albany), and Norstar Bank (founded as the State Bank of Albany in 1803). American Express was founded in Albany in 1850 as an express mail business. In 1871, the northwestern portion of Albany—west from Magazine Street—was <b>annexed</b> <b>to</b> the neighboring town of Guilderland after the town of Watervliet refused annexation of said territory. In return for this loss, portions of Bethlehem and Watervliet were added to Albany. Part of the land <b>annexed</b> <b>to</b> Guilderland was ceded back to Albany in 1910, setting up the current western border.|$|E
5|$|In the Northern Isles, James's cousin Patrick Stewart, Earl of Orkney, {{resisted}} the Statutes of Iona and was consequently imprisoned.

In 1849, John Ruskin {{spent a month}} in Chamonix, from where he painted some of the massif's mountains before undertaking the Tour of Mont Blanc. When Savoy was eventually <b>annexed</b> <b>to</b> France in 1860, Napoleon III and Empress Eugénie visited the region to mark the event and undertook to enhance road access leading {{to the end of}} the Arve valley.|$|E

5|$|Another such ill-fated {{settlement}} was Canemah, {{located near the}} Willamette Falls. Canemah prospered until 1861, when the same great flood swept most of the town over the falls. Even after reconstruction, much of the town's importance to river commerce ended in 1873 with completion of the Willamette Falls Locks. Ships no longer needed to dock and unload goods and passengers for portage around the falls. The remaining town officially survived until 1929, when it was <b>annexed</b> <b>to</b> Oregon City.|$|E
5|$|By {{the medieval}} period, {{the region was}} {{consolidated}} under the Garhwal Kingdom {{in the west and}} the Kumaon Kingdom in the east. During this period, learning and new forms of painting (the Pahari school of art) developed. Modern-day Garhwal was likewise unified under the rule of Parmars who, along with many Brahmins and Rajputs, also arrived from the plains., the seat of the Kumaon Kingdom. The Garhwal Kingdom was re-established from a smaller region in Tehri. It was <b>annexed</b> <b>to</b> Kingdom of Nepal by Amar Singh Thapa. After Anglo-Nepalese War, it was ceded to the British as part of the Treaty of Sugauli.|$|E
5|$|Candolle's {{initiation}} to botany {{happened in}} 1794 thanks to Pierre Etienne Vaucher in Geneva. He spent then {{four years at}} the Geneva Academy, studying science and law according to his father's wishes. In 1798, he moved to Paris after Geneva had been <b>annexed</b> <b>to</b> the French Republic. His botanical career began {{with the help of}} René Louiche Desfontaines, who recommended de Candolle for work in the herbarium of Charles Louis L'Héritier de Brutelle during the summer of 1798. The position elevated de Candolle's reputation and also led to valuable instruction from Desfontaines himself. de Candolle established his first genus, Senebiera, in 1799.|$|E

5|$|Cassel was <b>annexed</b> <b>to</b> France the {{following}} year {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Nijmegen, which ended the war. The annexation led to the town's defences being dismantled; it was considered indefensible, as it was within easy firing range of the nearby Mont des Récollets, and it would have cost far too much to fortify both hills. In addition, the revised frontier following the treaty was now a significant distance from Cassel and without the proximity of the border, the town was no longer seen as having much strategic significance.|$|E
5|$|Claudius <b>annexed</b> <b>to</b> {{the empire}} three regions that became {{important}} sources of auxiliary recruits: Britannia (43AD), {{and the former}} client kingdoms of Mauretania (44) and Thracia (46). The latter became as important as Illyria {{as a source of}} auxiliary recruits, especially cavalry and archers. Britain in mid-2nd century contained the largest number of auxiliary regiments in any single province: about 60 out of about 400 (15%). By the rule of Nero (54–68), auxiliary numbers may have reached, by one estimate, about 200,000 men, implying about 400 regiments.|$|E
5|$|Cortina's {{population}} grew steadily {{from the time}} when it was <b>annexed</b> <b>to</b> the Italian State until the 1960s. Thereafter, it underwent a sharp decline (down by 2,099 inhabitants over a 30-year period), with signs of recovery only in the very last few years. Nevertheless, with 6,112 inhabitants, Cortina d'Ampezzo is the seventh most populous place in the province following Belluno (36,509), Feltre (20,688), Sedico (9,734), Ponte nelle Alpi (8,521), Santa Giustina (6,795) and Mel (6,272). In 2008, there were 44 births (7.1 ‰) and 67 deaths (10.9%), resulting in an overall reduction of 23 inhabitants (-3.8 ‰). The town's 2,808 families consisted on average of 2.2 persons.|$|E

5|$|Following the June 29, 1889 elections, several {{suburban}} townships {{voted to}} be <b>annexed</b> <b>to</b> the city, which offered better services, such as improved water supply, sewerage, and fire and police protection. Hyde Park Township, however, had installed new waterworks in 1883 {{just north of}} 87th Street. Nonetheless, the majority of voters in 1889 supported annexation {{perhaps because of the}} city’s water system for fire prevention or because of the belief that township government had become too unwieldy. After the 1889 annexation Chicago was able to leverage efficiencies as the largest United States city in area and second largest in population.|$|E

5|$|In March 1914, the Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence was {{announced}} in Gjirokastër and it was confirmed in the Protocol of Corfu. The Republic, however, was short-lived, as Albania collapsed {{at the beginning of}} World War I. The Greek military returned in October–November 1914, and again captured Gjirokastër, along with Saranda and Korçë. In April 1916, the territory referred to by Greeks as Northern Epirus, including Gjirokastër, was <b>annexed</b> <b>to</b> Greece. The Paris Peace Conference, 1919 restored the pre-war status quo, essentially upholding the border line decided in the 1913 Protocol of Florence, and the city was again returned to Albanian control.|$|E
