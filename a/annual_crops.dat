40|$|Carbon and {{nitrogen}} cycles in grassland, <b>annual</b> <b>cropping</b> and integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems control soil quality and regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The {{aim of this}} study was to review the knowledge on driving factors controlling soil organic carbon (OC) accumulation and greenhouse gas emissions in tropical and subtropical Brazilian ecosystems under ICL and <b>annual</b> <b>cropping</b> systems. The ICL system has a significant potential to promote soil OC sequestration, mainly due to biomass addition but also because stabilization by physical protection and organo-mineral associations. The soil OC accumulation in ICL, compared to <b>annual</b> <b>cropping,</b> can extend up to 100 cm depth. In general, emission of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from soil is higher in ICL than in <b>annual</b> <b>cropping,</b> although the opposite may also occur. The N 2 O emission in ICL, however, can be offset by soil OC accumulation, although not always. Strategies to further increase soil OC sequestration and curb N 2 O emissions must be developed for ICL, which is a system that is being encouraged in Brazil because of the many ecosystem services and economical benefits that it provides. 201...|$|R

In his 1933 book Game Management, Leopold defined the science of wildlife management as [...] "the art of making land produce sustained <b>annual</b> <b>crops</b> of wild game for recreational use," [...] but as Curt Meine has pointed out, he also viewed it as a technique for restoring and maintaining diversity in the environment.|$|E

60|$|He {{sought to}} get a glimpse of his father's homestead. But it had been burnt down long ago. Accompanied by his son, dim-eyed and dim-hearted, he next went to find the site. But the roads had years before been changed. The old road was now browsed over by sheep; the new one ran {{straight}} through what had formerly been orchards. But new orchards, planted from other suckers, and in time grafted, throve on sunny slopes near by, where blackberries had once been picked by the bushel. At length he came to a field waving with buckwheat. It seemed one of those fields which himself had often reaped. But it turned out, upon inquiry, that but three summers since a walnut grove had stood there. Then he vaguely remembered that his father had sometimes talked of planting such a grove, to defend the neighboring fields against the cold north wind; yet where precisely that grove was to have been, his shattered mind could not recall. But it seemed not unlikely that during his long exile, the walnut grove had been planted and harvested, as well as the <b>annual</b> <b>crops</b> preceding and succeeding it, on the very same soil.|$|E

It {{is a waste of}} ground to plant peas; two rows, twelve feet by four, hardly produce a plateful. Manioc ripens between the sixth and ninth month, plantains and bananas once a year, cotton and rice in four months, and maize in forty days--with irrigation it is easy to grow three <b>annual</b> <b>crops.</b> The time for planting is before the rains, which here last six weeks to two months, September and October. The staple of commerce is now the nguba, or ground-nut (plural, jinguba), which Merolla calls incumba, with sometimes a little milho (maize), and Calavance beans. Of fruits we find trellised grapes, pines, and guavas, which, as at Fernando Po, are a weed. The agrumi, limes, oranges and citrons are remarkably fine, and hold, as of old, a high place in the simple medicines of the country. A cup of lime-leaf tea, drunk warm in the morning, is the favourite emetic and cathartic: even in Pliny's day we find [...] "Malus Assyria, quam alii vocant medicam (Mediam?, venenis medetur" [...] (xii. 7). On the Gold Coast and in the Gaboon region, colic and dysentery are cured by a calabash full of lime- juice, [...] "laced" [...] with red pepper. The peculiarity of European vegetables throughout maritime Congo and Angola is the absence of all flavour combined with the finest appearance; it seems as though something in the earth or atmosphere were wanting to their full development. Similarly, though in the upper regions the climate is delicious, the missionaries could not keep themselves alive, but died of privation, hardship, and fatigue.|$|E
40|$|<b>Annual</b> <b>cropping</b> systems {{dominate}} the earth 2 ̆ 7 s global cropland and {{contribute significantly to}} agriculture 2 ̆ 7 s overall impact on the environment. Ecological succession and thermodynamics provide useful frameworks for conceptualizing these systems and elucidating the mechanistic basis for their associated impacts. Under a succession-energy framework, <b>annual</b> <b>cropping</b> systems represent a state of perpetual early secondary succession {{which can only be}} maintained through the application of management energy. It is this management energy – often in the form of herbicides, physical disturbance, or synthetic N fertilizer – which ultimately results in non-target impacts on the environment. Additional negative environmental impacts occur as a consequence of our ability to undermine ecological succession processes that would otherwise absorb or convert the applied energy and materials to biomass. A conceptual model based on the relationship between the rate of ecological succession and management energy highlights how these factors interact to influence the magnitude of non-target environmental impact associated with <b>annual</b> <b>crop</b> production. This model provides a context for understanding, predicting, and mitigating some of the environmental impacts of agricultural management practices. Viewing agroecosystems through the lens of succession suggests that management practices that effectively ‘perennialize’ annual systems – by maintaining living plant cover, integrating perennial crops, or mimicking or promoting later successional processes and functions – will reduce the overall environmental impacts associated with <b>annual</b> <b>crop</b> production...|$|R
40|$|The crop {{evapotranspiration}} computing is {{a complex}} matter from many points of view, but also it represents a useful parameter in hydrological and climate studies. Due to climate changes, the natural systems are coming to be negatively affected. The seasonal and <b>annual</b> <b>crop</b> evapotranspiration under current climate (1991 - 2020) and future climate (2021 - 2050) were analysed using the mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and mean monthly potential evapotranspiration for average of 30 years. The spatial distribution of crop evapotranspiration was calculated considering the evapotranspiration coefficients taken from literature using four stages of crops growth. Additionally, the absolute and relative changes of the <b>annual</b> <b>crop</b> evapotranspiration were carried out. The <b>annual</b> <b>crop</b> evapotranspiration varies in the actual period from 56 mm to 1297 mm, while in the future period the <b>annual</b> <b>crop</b> evapotranspiration varies from 59 mm to 1410 mm, which implies the impact of future climate warming on the crop evapotranspiration in the South East Europe. The heights values were identified in the South of Greece, in the southwestern sides of Romania, in the East sides of Bulgaria, Croatia and European Turkey. The maximum seasonal crop evapotranspiration {{were found in the}} mid-season, both for present and future. The minimum values of seasonal crop evapotranspiration were obtained in the cold season, when the mean air temperature and crop coefficients are lower.
