5000|$|Various {{factors can}} {{play a part in}} one's success in arm wrestling. Technique and overall arm {{strength}} are the two greatest contributing factors to winning an arm wrestling match. Other factors such as the length of an arm wrestler's arm, his/her muscle and arm mass/density, hand grip size, wrist endurance and flexibility, reaction time, as well as countless other traits, can add to the advantages of one arm wrestler over another. It is sometimes used to prove who is stronger between two or more people.In competitive arm wrestling, as sanctioned by the United States Armwrestling Federation (USAF), arm wrestling is performed with both competitors standing up with their arms placed on a tournament arm wrestling table. Arm wrestling tournaments are also divided into weight classes as well as left and right-handed divisions. Furthermore, strict rules such as fouls given to penalties (such as the competitor's elbow leaving a matted area where the elbow is to remain at all times, or a false start), and trying to escape a possible <b>arm</b> <b>pin</b> by breaking the grip with the opponent may result in a loss at the table. Paraphrasing USAF rules, arm wrestlers must straighten their wrists without a time lapse of one minute during competition. [...] The World Armwrestling Federation (WAF) is the universally recognized global governing body of professional arm wrestling and comprises 80 member countries.|$|E
40|$|Quality {{increase}} of design indices of the <b>arm</b> <b>pin</b> surfaces {{at the expense}} of the turning into the final size before chemical and heat treatment lowers the races deformation effect in the process of heat treatment. At allows to refuse the finish grinding operations. The twening into the final size before the cementation in the comparison with the grinded pins after the heat treatment provides higher stability depthward of the cemented layer, less scattering of the surface hardness, and also forms better distribution gradient of the carbon concentration depthward. Three-cone rock bits rolling contact bearings with the arm pins treated by the turning into the final size showed half as higher contact endurance as the grinded ones after heat treatment. ????????? ???????? ??????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ???? ??? ?? ???? ??????? ? ???????? ?????? ????? ??????-??????????? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????????? ??????? ??????? ? ???????? ??????????????, ??? ????????? ?????????? ?? ????????????? ???????????? ????????. ????????? ???????? ? ???????? ?????? ????? ??????????? ?? ????????? ?? ???????????? ??????? ????? ?????????????? ???????????? ?????? ???????????? ?? ??????? ???????????????? ????, ??????? ??????????? ????????????? ?????????, ? ????? ????????? ?????? ???????? ????????????? ???????????? ???????? ?? ???????. ????? ??????? ?????????????? ??????? ?????, ? ??????? ????? ??? ?????????? ???????? ? ???????? ??????, ???????? ?????????????? ? 1, 5 ??? ?????? ?????????? ???????????? ?? ????????? ?? ???????????? ????? ??????????????...|$|E

5000|$|The {{final design}} for the T-13 hand grenade {{utilized}} a pressure trigger {{as well as an}} in-flight arming device. The grenade was designed to be thrown as a traditional baseball, and as such it was held with two fingers on a weighted and knurled [...] "butterfly cap" [...] and the <b>arming</b> <b>pin</b> was removed. Once thrown, the cap detached from the body of the grenade and a length of nylon string unwound until a secondary <b>arming</b> <b>pin</b> attached {{to the far end of}} the cord was pulled, arming the grenade to detonate upon impact with a hard surface. While the original design called for a 5.5 oz total weight, it was later decided that this was too light and the weight was increased to 12 oz.|$|R
50|$|Two short {{arms are}} set to form 90 degree angles against a third, longer drawing edge.

5000|$|The kata gatame (肩固, [...] "shoulder hold") is a pinning hold {{where the}} {{opponent}} is hugged around the head, {{with one of}} the opponent's <b>arms</b> <b>pinned</b> against his or her neck. It can be done from kesa-gatame in response to an opponent's escape attempt, during which the <b>arm</b> is <b>pinned</b> against his or her neck, and the hold around the neck is put in place. The kata-gatame is often seen as a chokehold, since it is easy to compress the opponent's neck from the hold by squeezing, in which case it is known as an arm triangle choke or side choke.|$|R

50|$|In a bear hug, {{the arms}} are wrapped tightly around the opponent's midsection, {{sometimes}} {{with one or}} both of the opponent's <b>arms</b> <b>pinned</b> to the opponent's body, so that the opponent's chest is held tightly to the attacker's chest. From this position the opponent can be taken down, sometimes by lifting and tilting and sometimes with the aid of a leg trip.|$|R

50|$|The mine is, in essence, {{a plastic}} bag {{containing}} explosive liquid. The mine is stored with a pin restraining a detonating plunger. Once the <b>arming</b> <b>pin</b> is removed, the plunger is slowly forced forward by a spring until it contacts the detonator, at which point it is armed. This takes between one and forty minutes, allowing the mine to be deployed manually, or air dropped.|$|R

50|$|The PMN-2 fuze {{features}} an arming delay of approximately 60 seconds. When the arming key is rotated and {{removed from the}} mine, the <b>arming</b> <b>pin</b> is sheared. This allows the air-bellows inside the mine to be inflated by the compression spring, which in turn lifts a “safety” bar from {{the path of the}} slide, unblocking its travel. The arming delay on a PMN-2 is significantly shorter than that of a PMN-1.|$|R
50|$|Pre-World War I Insignia. Distinctive {{ornamentation}} of {{a design}} desired {{by the organization}} was authorized for wear on the Mess Jacket uniform by designated organizations (staff corps, departments, corps of artillery, and infantry and cavalry regiments) per General Order 132 dated December 31, 1902. The distinctive ornamentation was described later as coats of <b>arms,</b> <b>pins</b> and devices. The authority continued until omitted in the Army uniform regulation dated December 26, 1911.|$|R
5000|$|The mine is armed by {{removing}} a pin which blocks the downward travel of the six-pronged plunger. After removing the <b>arming</b> <b>pin,</b> sufficient {{pressure on the}} plunger (by the victim's foot) forces it downwards into the main fuze body, which ignites a friction-sensitive pyrotechnic composition. The burning pyrotechnic composition flashes through to the detonator which fires, initiating a small RDX booster pellet which in turn detonates the main TNT explosive charge.|$|R

50|$|The Delfin Clutch has an attacking wrestler {{crossing}} {{the arms of}} the opponent across their own chest while they're lying on their back on the mat. The attacking wrestler then kneels down on one knee on the opponent's <b>arms,</b> <b>pinning</b> the opponent's shoulders down to the mat. The attacking wrestler then grabs the opponent's legs, crosses them, and places them under one of their armpits, bending the opponent to a pinning predicament.|$|R
50|$|The double overhooks are {{generally}} considered inferior to double underhooks, {{and are often}} used in response to double underhooks by the opponent. If the opponent's hands can be locked to the opponent's body {{it is possible to}} advance into a bear hug, with the opponent's <b>arms</b> <b>pinned.</b> Most commonly however, the overhooks are used to prevent the opponent from advancing into a bear hug, by locking the double overhooks around the opponent's double underhooks.|$|R

50|$|In wrestling, a bear hug, {{also known}} as a bodylock, is a {{grappling}} clinch hold and stand-up grappling position where the arms are wrapped around the opponent, either around the opponent's chest, midsection, or thighs, sometimes with {{one or both of the}} opponent's <b>arms</b> <b>pinned</b> to the opponent's body. The hands are locked around the opponent and the opponent is held tightly to the chest. The bear hug is a dominant position, with great control over the opponent, and also allows an easy takedown to the back mount position.|$|R
5000|$|Of the {{two types}} of pressure-fuze {{available}} for Teller mines, the T.Mi.Z.43 fuze was notable for featuring an integral anti-handling device as standard: when the T.Mi.Z.43 fuze is inserted and the pressure plate (or screw cap) is screwed down into place, it shears a weak <b>arming</b> <b>pin</b> inside the fuze with an audible [...] "snap". This action arms the anti-handling device. Thereafter, any attempt to disarm the mine by unscrewing the pressure plate (or screw cap) to remove the fuze will automatically release the spring-loaded firing pin inside it, triggering detonation.|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} mechanism between transverse domain walls (TDWs) in Permalloy nanowires and artificially patterned traps is studied using high-sensitivity spatially resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect {{measurements and}} numerical simulations. T-shaped trap geometries are considered, where a DW {{traveling in the}} horizontal <b>arm</b> is <b>pinned</b> by the vertical <b>arm.</b> <b>Pinning</b> strengths as well as potential energy modifications created by the traps are measured, and {{the roles of the}} different DW characteristic parameters, such as the DW core orientation and the magnetic charge distribution within the DW, are presented. It is found that whether or not the core of the DW is aligned with the transverse arm of the T structure affects the shape of the main potential experienced by the DW, whereas the pinning strength strongly depends on which side of the V-shaped TDW interacts with the trap. The role of the magnetostatic interaction between the charge of the DW and the charge present at the junction is discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Non-explosive grenades are {{generally}} closer to water balloons in function. One common grenade design {{consists of a}} rubber tube sealed securely {{at one end and}} more loosely at the other, with an <b>arming</b> <b>pin</b> which, when pulled, loosens that end. The tube is filled with paint under pressure, usually from a syringe. When the grenade is thrown against a hard surface, the loose end of the tube is unsealed, and the paint is sprayed over a wide area, potentially marking players. Another common design consists of a small compressed CO2 tank surrounded by a container of paint.|$|R
