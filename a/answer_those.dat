5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How should he <b>answer</b> <b>those</b> who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory {{if it is in}} his power? What should he say to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.|$|E

He felt that working with a small team necessitated having a defined vision for the game from the outset, [...] "to <b>answer</b> <b>those</b> first questions {{about what you want}} your game to be". Sometimes, ideas came about during development {{that would have to be}} thrown out for not fitting with the game's original vision. [...] "We kill our darlings at Sucker Punch.

Hall announced their return during the 2015 BET Awards, where the show's cast had attended to say [...] "their final goodbyes". Discussing the direction intended for Melanie and Derwin's final appearance, Brock Akil said: [...] "To bring these characters back to shore is such a blessing. They get an ending. They get closure." [...] She added that their storyline would appeal to the show's fans, explaining: [...] "I feel creatively we've been able to <b>answer</b> <b>those</b> who have been loyal to us. It's truly a tip of the hat to the fans who will get to see if Melanie and Derwin get their happily-ever-after." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 31, 2012, Roy {{signed with}} the Minnesota Timberwolves. The deal put Roy with All-Star forward Kevin Love and point guard Ricky Rubio. He decided to wear No. 3, the number he wore during his college years at Washington. He felt well during {{training}} camp but suffered an injury after a collision during a preseason game on October 26, 2012. He played in five regular season games before needing season-ending surgery on his right knee. He averaged 5.8 points per game, 2.8 rebounds per game, and 4.6 assists per game in 24.4 minutes during the 2012–13 season. Roy was waived by Minnesota on May 10, 2013. Afterwards, he said, [...] "Any time you {{walk away from the}} game, you have 'what-ifs'. I feel like I was able to <b>answer</b> <b>those</b> questions last year by going out there and giving it a try." ...|$|E
500|$|David is an android {{that acts}} as the ship's butler and {{maintenance}} man. It {{is designed to be}} indistinguishable from humans, and begins to develop [...] "its own ego, insecurities, jealousy and envy". Writer Damon Lindelof stated that the character provides a non-human perspective on the film's events, and said, [...] "what does the movie look like from the robot's point of view? If you were to ask him, 'What do you think about all of this? What's going on? What do you think about these humans who are around you?' Wouldn't it be cool if we found a way for that robot to <b>answer</b> <b>those</b> questions?" [...] Fassbender said, [...] "David's views on the human crew are somewhat childlike. He is jealous and arrogant because he realizes that his knowledge is all-encompassing, and therefore he is superior to the humans. David wants to be acknowledged and praised for his brilliance". In developing his character, Fassbender avoided watching the android characters of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), and instead studied the replicants in Scott's 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner, with a focus on Sean Young's character Rachael, whose [...] "vacancy" [...] and longing for a soul interested him. Fassbender drew further inspiration from the voice of the HAL 9000 computer in , the [...] "funny walk and economy of movement" [...] of Olympic diver Greg Louganis, and the performances of David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, Dirk Bogarde in The Servant, and Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia. David's blond hair was modeled on that of T. E. Lawrence. Scott favored Fassbender for the role; by January 2011 he was confirmed to have joined the cast, despite earlier reports that his agents had sought too high a fee.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "correlatives" [...] are a {{paradigm}} of pro-forms, {{used to ask}} and answer the questions what, where, when, why, who, whose, how, how much, and what kind. They are constructed from set elements so that correlatives with similar meanings have similar forms: There are nine endings corresponding to the nine wh- questions, and five initial elements that perform the functions of asking, answering, denying, being inclusive, and being indefinite about these nine questions. For example, the words kiam (when) and kiu (who, which), with the initial ki- of questions, ask about time and individuals, whereas the words tiam (then) and tiu (this/that one), with the same endings but the initial ti- of demonstratives, <b>answer</b> <b>those</b> questions, and the words neniam (never) and neniu (no-one) deny those questions. Thus by learning these 14 elements the speaker acquires {{a paradigm}} of 45 adverbs and pronouns.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1164, Becket {{attempted}} {{to go to}} France without permission, which was forbidden by the Constitutions. He was caught, and then tried on 6 October 1164 at a royal court on different charges of failing to adequately address a suit brought against him by nobleman John Marshal about lands that Becket had confiscated. Once at the council, [...] Becket {{was found guilty of}} ignoring the court summons and under pressure from the bishops, accepted the sentence of confiscation of all non-landed property pending the pleasure of the king. However, the original dispute over John Marshal's lands was decided in the archbishop's favour. The king then brought further charges and asked for an accounting of Becket's spending while the archbishop had been chancellor. Another charge was that he was not fulfilling his oath to observe the Constitutions. Becket replied that he was not prepared to <b>answer</b> <b>those</b> charges and was eventually found guilty of both. The archbishop refused to accept the sentence, and fled Northampton and took sanctuary.|$|E
