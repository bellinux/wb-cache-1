5|$|As the 1992 Kansas City Chiefs season began, the team's {{first big}} move was {{the signing of}} quarterback Dave Krieg to compete with DeBerg and Vlasic. A couple weeks after Krieg's signing, DeBerg signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, leaving Vlasic as the primary backup to Krieg. The Chiefs went into {{training}} camp <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> preseason with Krieg, Vlasic, and rookie draft pick Matt Blundin. Krieg ended up playing every snap of the season, leaving both Vlasic without a year's worth of playing time as his contract expired. The trading of Joe Montana to the Chiefs put a definitive end to Vlasic's time in Kansas City.|$|E

25|$|In December 2008, a {{slowdown}} in passenger traffic led the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority to curtail spending plans, including deferring multimillion-dollar construction projects. The weak economy continued to affect the airport in 2010, with figures showing a 6% decline in passengers {{for the fiscal year}} ending June 30. The slowdown is one reason the airport authority scrapped plans to spend $4 million to erect barriers at the west end of the runway. In 2000, a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 flight with 142 persons aboard overshot the runway <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> fence, coming to a stop on Hollywood Way near a Chevron gas station.|$|E

25|$|From {{the start}} of the crisis, al-Mu'tazz was {{concerned}} with portraying himself as the legitimate caliph. He had been proclaimed as heir-apparent during his father's lifetime, and according to the succession arrangements he should have become caliph after the death of al-Muntasir. When he had signed away his rights to the caliphate in 862, he had been under duress to do so, with the Turks threatening to kill him if he refused, and therefore he considered the deed of abdication to be void. He also sought to convince the people that they could switch their allegiance to him without breaking the oath they had taken to serve al-Musta'in, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> effort to explain in detail how this could be done in a letter to Muhammad b. 'Abdallah.|$|E
25|$|In Lithuania {{there were}} four ghettos that {{remained}} after a mass murder campaign by the Nazis in 1941. There were armed resistance groups in three of them. These ghettos were Vilna, Oszmiana, and Kovno. The Vilna Ghetto {{was the site of}} the first Jewish resistance group known as FPO. The FPO tried to persuade the occupants within the Vilna Ghetto to revolt against the Nazis but it failed. This led the group to leave after an armed altercation in September 1943. The partisan group left the ghetto {{because of a lack of}} support <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> sewers to escape to the eastern Lithuanian woods. However the partisan group in the Kovno Ghetto had no intention of fighting in the ghetto itself. They had always planned to fight outside of the ghetto. They organized a large escape from the ghetto that took place over a long period of time. It led to many people escaping and joining outside partisan groups, which eventually led them to create their own.|$|E

25|$|A {{great deal}} of cosmological thought seems to have {{underlain}} each of the Aztec sacrificial rites. Most of the sacrificial rituals took more than two people to perform. In the usual procedure of the ritual, the sacrifice would {{be taken to the}} top of the temple. The sacrifice would then be laid on a stone slab, a chacmool, by four priests, and his/her abdomen would be sliced open by a fifth priest with a ceremonial knife made of flint. The most common form of human sacrifice was heart-extraction. The Aztec believed that the heart (tona) was both the seat of the individual and a fragment of the Sun's heat (istli). The chacmool was a very important religious tool used during sacrifices. The cut was made in the abdomen <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> diaphragm. The priest would grab the heart which would be placed in a bowl held by a statue of the honored god, and the body would then be thrown down the temple's stairs. The body would land on a terrace at the base of the pyramid called an apetlatl.|$|E
25|$|Local traditions {{states that}} when the village was still called Benquerença, there was a {{beautiful}} orphan princess who lived in her uncle, {{the lord of the}} castle. The princess {{fell in love with a}} noble young knight who did not possess great wealth. For this reason, the young man left the village in search of fortune, promising to return when he felt he had a worthy fortune to ask for her hand. For years, the princess refused all suitors, until her uncle promised her to a friend, forcing her to compromise. When she was presented to the uncle of her suitor, she confessed that her heart belonged to another man. This revelation infuriated her uncle, who thought of a ruse to coerce her to marry the one he chose. At night, he disguised as a ghost, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ports of the Princess quarters, pretending to be the ghost of her lover, telling her to marr her suitor or otherwise be subject to damnation. As he was about to get an oath from her, the door to her bedroom opened with a bright ray of light, exposing her uncle's treachery. She went to live in the tower and the two windows became known as the Port of Treason and the Port of Light.|$|E
