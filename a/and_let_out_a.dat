2500|$|There {{was only}} one catch and that was Catch-22, which {{specified}} that a concern for one's safety {{in the face of}} dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All {{he had to do was}} ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to, but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> respectful whistle. (p. 56, ch. 5) ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He bustled out of {{the room}} to the veranda, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>an</b> ear-splitting whistle for their Pedro. Having heard the brute's {{answering}} howl, Ricardo ran back into the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{there is}} a secret spring hidden by the engraving," [...] {{suggested}} Tom. [...] "Hunt around. It may fly apart <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> hundred thousand in diamonds." ...|$|E
60|$|With great {{deliberation}} the German youth {{opened the}} leather cardcase. Out of it fluttered a small card photograph. Sam picked it up, gave one look, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> cry of astonishment.|$|E

60|$|This gave Blumpo {{a chance}} to rise. He {{scrambled}} up <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> long and loud yell for help. Luckily, some other boys were not far away. They heard the cry and arrived on a run.|$|E
6000|$|But it {{was just}} this {{question}} of beginning which exercised him so grievously. How was he to begin? Should he {{go straight to the}} cot and wake the kid? Suppose the kid was scared <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> howl? ...|$|E
60|$|All of {{a sudden}} Jones stood up, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> wild Comanche yell. I was more startled by the yell than by the great hand he smashed down on my shoulder, and for the moment I was dazed.|$|E

60|$|He put {{his fingers}} {{into his mouth}} <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> whistle which seemed to drive a thin, sharp shaft of air solidly against one's nearest ear-drum. Though he greatly enjoyed Heyst's {{involuntary}} grimace, he sat perfectly stolid waiting for {{the effect of the}} call.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course the}} animal fell back, and down went the torch {{on the rocks}} below, and Dick was now utterly defenseless.

Upon this realization, Iskender delights at the power he now seemingly has over the Peri.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the third}} film, [...] "Blackie" [...] (as {{designated}} by another Krite), encounters Annie {{near the entrance}} {{on her way to}} find help.

Although it serves the purpose of temporarily disarming or stunning the victim, it also serves as a beacon to alert the other Krites. This mechanism is never used or heard of in any other installment.|$|R
50|$|The video {{begins with}} Solange {{singing and dancing}} in a white room in a blue dress {{in front of her}} band. Then in the {{background}} CGI clouds appear, and Solange draws a sun with her hand, setting the stage for the video.

60|$|The blow {{took the}} Rockpoint bully behind the ear, <b>and</b> Crosby <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> wild yell of pain, {{broken by a}} gasp for air, as he went under the bosom of the ocean.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> his son <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> peal of laughter, {{bitter and}} scornful and unsatisfied.|$|R
60|$|All {{began to}} search around in various directions, <b>and</b> {{presently}} Sam <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> call.|$|R
60|$|The bear raised {{himself on}} his hind legs <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> growl at the newcomers. Hardly had the sound arose upon the air when Benson's rifle cracked, and a bullet hit the beast in the breast. Down went the animal on all fours, but did not tumble further. Instead, he made a swift bound for the scout's horse.|$|E
60|$|At last, about half-past {{ten of the}} clock, {{we came to the}} top of a brae, and saw lights below us.

60|$|Hastily, half-running, {{with their}} monkish raiment kilted to the knee, they plunged through the deep snow and {{threaded}} {{the labyrinth of}} marine lumber; and they were already more than half way round the harbour when, as they were passing close before an alehouse, the door suddenly opened <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> gush of light upon their fleeting figures.|$|E
60|$|Just then Toto, who {{had been}} {{growling}} to himself in a cross way gave a sharp bark and flew at the yellow hen, who ruffled her feathers <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> such <b>an</b> angry screech that Dorothy was startled.|$|R
5000|$|... 13. One last time, Coyote {{attempts}} to ensnare his nemesis. He mines a canyon with myriad explosives behind a doorway with many [...] "FREE BIRD SEED" [...] declarations and connects the main controller to the door. Unfortunately, {{as soon as}} Coyote climbs over the wall, he encounters a gigantic truck. With no recourse, Wile E. {{opens the door and}} is blown up repeatedly, then run over by the truck. The cartoon ends with a charred and disoriented Wile E. sticking <b>out</b> his tongue <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> [...] "beep, beep" [...] in an imitation of the Road Runner, then falling unconscious.|$|R
50|$|Carmen hides {{in another}} room where she {{continues}} {{to see and hear}} things. Dariusz, who understands and speaks English, leads Marcus back to the kitchen and gives him the truck keys. Not wanting to risk Dariusz going out and calling for help, Marcus also ties him up. The boy begs for Marcus to <b>let</b> them go <b>and</b> warns him that Carmen is evil since she has seen the statue. Carmen is then possessed by a demon while she is alone in the room <b>and</b> <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> very loud shriek. The cultists, who have gotten free and are looking for her, hear the shriek and are alerted to Carmen's location.|$|R
