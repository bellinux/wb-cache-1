40|$|Breast {{attenuation}} (BA) {{is recognized}} {{as a cause of}} artifactual anterior perfusion abnormalities on SPECT thallium imaging (TI) in women. To study the effect of BA on all myocardial regions, we used the change <b>in</b> <b>apparent</b> regional perfusion caused by left breast repositioning as an index of BA. TI was performed on 432 women and 2 redistribution images were acquired: Rl (breast neutral position) and R 2 (breast repositioned to upper left). In 11 control pts the R 2 image was performed without repositioning. For each pt, 2 separate polar maps were constructed from Rl and R 2 short axis slices and were divided into lateral, inferior, septal, anterior, and apical sectors. Mean normalized counts per pixel (MNC) were determined for each sector. The change <b>in</b> <b>apparent</b> perfusion due to breast repositioning for a given sector was computed as (MNC in R 2) —(MNC in Rl) and was determined for each sector in all pts. The change <b>in</b> <b>apparent</b> perfusion occurring <b>in</b> a sector due to intrastudy variability was determined as the 95 % confidence limits of (MNC in R 2) —(MNC in Rl) for that sector in the control subjects. A significant change <b>in</b> <b>apparent</b> perfusion <b>in</b> a sector due to breast repositioning was defined as one which exceeds the 95 % confidence limits for intrastudy variability for that sector. ResultsBreast repositioning caused a significant change <b>in</b> <b>apparent</b> perfusion <b>in</b> 91 % of patients in at least one sector. The number of pts showing a change <b>in</b> <b>apparent</b> perfusion <b>in</b> each sector is shown:n= 432 ptslatintsepantapexdecreased perfusion 19735212610 no change 335288295193207 increased perfusion 787185113215 ConclusionBreast repositioning studies suggest that BA affects SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging in the majority of women. Although the greatest frequency of change in perfusion occurs in the anterior segment, the breast attenuation influences all segments...|$|R

After Turismod died, his younger brother Cunimund became commander in Sirmium and thus heir apparent.|$|E
5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed.

When a pulmonary contusion is <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E

5|$|Although {{freshwater}} invertebrates inhabiting and comprising {{algae and}} periphyton make {{the foundation of}} food webs {{in the middle and}} lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding {{on the bottom of the}} river and ocean floors. The abundance and importance of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) is <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> the many middens left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high. Oysters and other mollusks serve as the primary food source of shorebirds. The large trees that line the river from its source to south of Jacksonville begin to transition into salt marshes east of the city. Mayport is home to approximately 20 shrimping vessels that use the mouth of the St. Johns to access the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 8th {{century as}} {{architectural}} styles evolved, new elements were added as is evident in kasuga-zukuri (Kasuga Shrine and Hakusandō/Kasugadō at Enjō-ji), the flowing roof or nagare-zukuri (Shimogamo Shrine), hachiman-zukuri (Usa Shrine) and hiyoshi-zukuri (Hiyoshi Taisha). The nagare-zukuri continues to be the more popular style, followed by the kasuga-zukuri. The honden of Ujigami Shrine dates to this period.
