50|$|There {{also some}} {{alternative}} {{options in the}} way of interceptors like # Unichip that clamp the various inputs to the standard management systems, but they are restricted by the fact that fuel delivery generally cannot be easily increased as manipulation of the <b>air-flow</b> <b>meter</b> input and/or aggressive modifying of the ignition timing causes the Check Engine Light (CEL) to illuminate easily due to a deviation between the expected and targeted torque and quality of emissions.It is therefore common to increase the fuel pressure across the board by using an aftermarket fuel pressure regulator when tuning is performed by these interceptor computers, and trim the fuel out instead. However, increased fuel pressure has the side-effect of affecting the engine's ability to idle due to injector lockup, and as such sometimes an alternative solution of additional injectors instead of a raised-fuel-pressure regulator is proposed.The number of cars with such complex requirements is very low, and in general a full aftermarket engine management system is used in these cases, such as Nira or MoTeC.|$|E
30|$|This {{part of the}} {{experiment}} was performed in a 5 L fermentor (GBCN- 5 C, Zhenjiang East Biotech Equipment and Technology Co., Ltd, China) with a working volume of 3 L. The fermentor was equipped with a temperature probe, pH sensor and dissolved oxygen (DO) sensor. The height and diameter of the 5 L fermentor were 0.35 and 0.2  m, respectively. The agitation system was a coupling of stirrer that consisted of two propellers on one axle and each propeller had four flat-blades. The agitation rate was controlled by electromagnetic impulse. The aeration system was an air inlet through a ring sparger with <b>air-flow</b> <b>meter</b> and filter. The fermentor and all its parts containing 3 litre medium was sterilized at 121  °C for 30  min. After sterilization, the fermentation medium was inoculated with 5 % (v/v) seed medium. Diluted antifoaming agent was added when foam appeared in the fermentor during the fermentation process. The temperature and aeration rate were maintain at 28  °C and 3  L/min during the whole fermentation process, respectively. The agitation speed was controlled {{in the range of}} 150 – 300  rpm to maintain the DO concentrations over 20 % saturation, which made sure that oxygen supply was enough for cell growth. Samples were acquired from fermentor at every 24  h interval for analysis of GP- 1 production and dry cell weight (DCW).|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} investigations and {{the assessment of}} multi-stage fuel injection in MultiJet 1. 3 engine operating under load conditions. Basic work parameters of the examined piston internal combustion engine, such as: effective power, torque, hour and unit fuel consumption and the concentration {{of the most important}} noxious components of exhaust gases were provided. Tests were conducted at the test bench stand that comprised the engine under consideration, eddy-current brake by Elektromex EMX company, control and measurement unit to control the test bench and to take measurements of parameters of the engine and brake work, the measurement system for fast-changing quantities, fuel-flow and <b>air-flow</b> <b>meters,</b> and the exhaust gas analyser. During the tests, the engine operated under load conditions at the crankshaft rotational speed: n= 1200, 1750, 2400, 3800 and 4200 rpm. Such values of speed were selected because of the multi-stage fuel injection and the engine’s being able to reach the maximum torque M= 200 Nm at the crankshaft rotational speed n= 1750 rpm and the maximum power output N= 90 HP, delivered at n= 4200 rpm. Application of advanced engine technologies and advanced control system allowed meeting high requirements concerning energy and economic as well as environmental indices...|$|R
