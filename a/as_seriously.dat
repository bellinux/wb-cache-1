5|$|French authors like Franck Marie (1978), Pierre Jarnac (1985), (1988), Jean-Luc Chaumeil (1994), {{and more}} {{recently}} Marie-France Etchegoin and Frédéric Lenoir (2004), Massimo Introvigne (2005), Jean-Jacques Bedu (2005), and Bernardo Sanchez Da Motta (2005), have never taken Plantard and the Priory of Sion <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> as Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh. They eventually concluded {{that it was all}} a hoax, outlining in detail the reasons for their verdict, and giving detailed evidence that the Holy Blood authors had not reported comprehensively. They imply that this evidence had been ignored by Lincoln, Baigent, and Leigh to bolster the mythical version of the Priory's history that was developed by Plantard during the early 1960s after meeting author Gérard de Sède.|$|E

The battle, dubbed Operation Praying Mantis by the U.S., was {{launched}} in retaliation for the USS Samuel B. Roberts striking a mine laid in the channel by Iran on 14 April. U.S. forces sank one frigate, one gunboat, and up to six armed speedboats, as well <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> damaging a second frigate.|$|E

25|$|The River Avoca is {{classified}} <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> polluted by the Irish EPA {{as a result}} of the discharge of sewage directly into the river in addition to a long history of industrial pollution in the area from early mining operations and more recent chemical industries. In previous centuries, Arklow was renowned for oyster beds, however, these were destroyed over a century ago by pollutants from mining operations flowing down the river into the estuary.|$|E
25|$|There was {{widespread}} political unrest in Ireland during the 1920s. The railways were prime targets although the NCC {{did not suffer}} <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> as other lines. On 25 March 1921, wooden buildings at Crossroads, Cargan, Parkmore and Retreat on the Cushendall line were set on fire and completely destroyed. The same night the signal cabins at Killagan and Dunloy on the main line were destroyed by fire while that at Glarryford suffered minor damage.|$|E
25|$|The England–Germany {{football}} rivalry {{is considered}} to be mainly an English phenomenon—in the run-up to any competition match between the two teams, many UK newspapers will print articles detailing results of previous encounters, such as those in 1966 and 1990. Football fans in England often consider Germany to be their main sporting rivals and care more about this rivalry than those with other nations, such as Argentina or Scotland. Most German fans consider the Netherlands or Italy to be their traditional footballing rivals, and as such, usually the rivalry is not taken quite <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> there as it is in England.|$|E

25|$|The ATLB {{and some}} {{industry}} peers regarded the firm <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> undercapitalised and {{saw this as}} {{a major cause of}} financial instability. The management's refusal to contemplate a fundamental change in the way the business was run, including a change in the top management itself, undermined the confidence of Hambros Bank, the airline's main creditor, in its prospects. These circumstances led to the withdrawal of Hambros's support. At the time of its bankruptcy, British Eagle operated 25 aircraft and employed a staff of 2,300, including 220 pilots. The failed company owed its creditors £5½ million; Rolls-Royce and Esso, who were owed £630,000 and £300,000 respectively, headed the list of creditors.|$|E
25|$|When Tiffany Raymond reappears, Natalie feels sidelined by Bianca {{as she did}} in school. Bianca's boyfriend Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) also {{tires of}} Bianca's {{selfishness}} and this inadvertently drives him and Natalie closer together. They console each other and in February 1995, they begin an affair. Ricky is Natalie's first sexual partner and for her it is true love, but Ricky does not take it <b>as</b> <b>seriously.</b> Natalie starts pressuring Ricky to tell Bianca about their relationship {{and when he does}} not, Natalie plants some lingerie in his work overalls. Bianca finds it and suspects Ricky is having an affair; she takes Natalie's advice to follow Ricky so she can catch him with the mystery woman. Bianca does this one night and catches them kissing and is incensed. In the aftermath, Ricky dumps Natalie and Bianca threatens her, ordering her to leave Walford. Dejected, Natalie does so, leaving Walford to stay with her sister in Basingstoke.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, Bournonville {{decided to}} compose {{his own version}} of the story about the young man who is danced into a spell by a group of elf maidens. In an {{engraving}} from 1856, the painter Edvard Lehmann, who was also a close friend of the Bournonville family, portrayed the spellbound Junker Ove encircled by the hovering, luminous elves. Ove is briefly imprisoned in this state, but fortunately the beautiful Hilda comes to his rescue with water from a healing spring. Even though she has grown up among trolls inside the hill, we know that she is really a changeling, swapped as a baby with the temperamental Birthe, who is the real troll child. The changeling aspect means that the story never becomes <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> dangerous for Ove as the Sylphide's enchantment is for James in Bournonville's Taglioni-inspired ballet from 1836. But then, again, the Danish Romantics did not cultivate fragmentation {{in the same way as}} the French. The Danes sought for the harmony and the idyll.|$|E

500|$|Lewis {{later wrote}} in [...] "To {{restrict}} {{the group of}} acids to those substances that contain hydrogen interferes <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> with the systematic understanding of chemistry as would the restriction of the term oxidizing agent to substances containing oxygen." [...] In Lewis theory an acid, A, and a base, B:, form an adduct, AB, in which the electron pair is used to form a dative covalent bond between A and B. This is illustrated {{with the formation of}} the adduct H3N−BF3 from ammonia and boron trifluoride, a reaction that cannot occur in aqueous solution because boron trifluoride reacts violently with water in a hydrolysis reaction.|$|E
500|$|Whittall {{believes}} {{that one reason}} for Britten's enduring popularity is the [...] "progressive conservatism" [...] of his music. He generally avoided the avant garde, and did not challenge the conventions {{in the way that}} contemporaries such as Tippett did. Perhaps, says Brett, [...] "the tide that swept away serialism, atonality and most forms of musical modernism and brought in neo-Romanticism, minimalism and other modes of expression involved with tonality carried with it renewed interest in composers who had been {{out of step with the}} times". Britten defined his mission as a composer in very simple terms: composers should aim at [...] "pleasing people today <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> as we can".|$|E
500|$|During the shoot, Harris {{suffered}} from depression, {{and believed that}} her co-stars {{did not take the}} film <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> as she did. At times, she would cry in her makeup chair prior to the day's shoot. Bloom did not speak to Harris while filming continued, which worsened her depression. Afterward, Bloom told Harris that the lack of interaction had helped her build her own performance and the two women reconciled. [...] Harris incorporated her own depression into her performance. Wise heightened the sense of character conflict by having the characters [...] "step on one another's lines", allowing one character to begin talking before the other had finished. On occasion, the characters simply talk at the same time.|$|E

500|$|Barney did {{not take}} her poetry <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> as Vivien did, saying, [...] "if I had one {{ambition}} it was to make my life itself into a poem." [...] Her plays were only performed through amateur productions in her garden. According to Karla Jay, most of them lacked coherent plots and [...] "would probably baffle even the most sympathetic audience." [...] After 1910 she mostly wrote the epigrams and memoirs for which she is better known. Her last book of poetry was called Poems & Poemes: Autres Alliances and came out in 1920, bringing together romantic poetry in both French and English. Barney asked Ezra Pound to edit the poems but then ignored the detailed recommendations he made.|$|E
500|$|Before the spill, an {{inspection}} of the 28 year old Line 901 pipeline found extensive corrosion problems resulting in thinning pipeline walls. [...] The pipeline {{did not have an}} automatic shut-off valve that would have been required on an intrastate pipeline as Line 901 is categorized as an interstate pipeline. Officials from Plains All American Pipeline claimed that installing a new valve would present other potential dangers. The line underwent a comprehensive internal inspection in July 2012 and since then the area where the pipe broke had been repaired at least three times. [...] Line 903 is a much longer pipeline that transports the oil from Line 901 inland to gathering facilities and refineries. LIne 903 was also found to be corroded though not <b>as</b> <b>seriously.</b>|$|E

Of course he's scared but he deals with it by just wanting to laugh it off and make jokes about it". He speculated that the experience would force Sam to grow up and appreciate life more, as well <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> consider the future of his daughter, Grace, and cease his philandering way with female staff.

500|$|... "Home" [...] {{was first}} {{submitted}} to the censors featuring audio of the baby screaming while being buried alive. Ten Thirteen Productions was asked by Fox executives to alter the audio so that the baby would sound sick; they noted that the audio change was needed to show the child was diseased and that the Peacocks were not simply killing an innocent child. Manners called the shot, shown from the child's perspective, of the baby's burial as [...] "the most awful shot of my career". He said that he approached filming <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> as he could because he felt the script was a classic. [...] When production was finished, {{he said that he}} loved the episode and called it one of his favorites. Duchovny agreed with Manners, saying, [...] "I really like that one. Although it didn't scare me." [...] He explained that it [...] "touched" [...] him with its themes concerning the desire to [...] "live and to propagate." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} {{was one of}} a number of British works challenging the set categories of the rigid, French-dictated hierarchy of genres in the late 18th century, as other types of painting aspired to be treated <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> as the costumed history painting of a Classical or mythological subject. In some respects the Orrery and Air Pump subjects resembled conversation pieces, then largely a form of middle-class portraiture, though soon to be given new status when Johann Zoffany began to paint the royal family in about 1766. Given their solemn atmosphere however, and as it seems none of the figures are intended to be understood as portraits (even if models may be identified), the paintings can not be regarded as conversation pieces. The 20th-century art historian Ellis Waterhouse compares these two works to the [...] "genre serieux" [...] of contemporary French drama, as defined by Denis Diderot and Pierre Beaumarchais, a view endorsed by Egerton.|$|E

Obama said the incident did not represent the [...] "exceptional character" [...] of the American military and the respect that the United States had for the people of Afghanistan. On 13 March, he said, [...] "the United States takes this <b>as</b> <b>seriously</b> as if it were our own citizens and our own children who were murdered. We’re heartbroken over the loss of innocent life. The killing of innocent civilians is outrageous and it’s unacceptable." [...] In response to a reporter asking whether the killings could be likened to the 1968 My Lai massacre of civilians by U.S. forces in South Vietnam, Obama replied, [...] "It's not comparable. It appeared you had a lone gunman who acted on his own." ...|$|E
