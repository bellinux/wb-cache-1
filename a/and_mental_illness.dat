5|$|Philosophy of {{psychiatry}} explores philosophical questions relating to psychiatry <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b> The philosopher {{of science and}} medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy {{of psychiatry}}. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the philosophy of mind and psychopathology.|$|E
5|$|The Dark Side of the Moon is {{the eighth}} album by English rock band Pink Floyd, {{released}} on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records. The album built on ideas explored in earlier recordings and live shows, but lacks the extended instrumental excursions following {{the departure of}} founding member and principal contributor, Syd Barrett, in 1968, that characterised their earlier work. It thematically explores conflict, greed, the passage of time, <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illness,</b> the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.|$|E
5|$|Both {{environmental}} factors and genetics {{are associated with}} alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is {{three to four times}} more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b> Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{examine the}} {{association}} between type of multimorbidity and CAM use among adults with multimorbidity. Methods. The current study used a cross-sectional design with retrospective data from 2012 National Health Interview Survey. Multimorbidity was classified into two groups: (1) adults with coexisting physical <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> <b>and</b> (2) adults with two or more chronic physical illnesses only. CAM use was measured using a set of 18 variables. Logistic regression and multinomial logistic regressions {{were used to assess}} {{the association between}} the type of multimorbidity and ever used CAM, CAM use in the past 12 months, and type of CAM. Results. Overall, 31. 2 % of adults with coexisting physical <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> <b>and</b> 20. 1 % of adults with only physical illnesses used CAM in the past 12 months. Adults with coexisting physical <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> were more likely to ever use CAM (AOR = 1. 68, 95 % CI = 1. 49, 1. 90), use CAM in the past 12 months (AOR = 1. 32, 95 % CI = 1. 15, 1. 52), and use mind-body therapies in the past 12 months (AOR = 1. 36, 95 % CI = 1. 16, 1. 59) compared to adults with only physical illnesses. Conclusion. Multimorbidity of chronic physical <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> was associated with higher CAM use...|$|R

25|$|Another {{theory is}} {{that there may be}} shared risk factors that can lead to both {{substance}} abuse <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b> Mueser hypothesizes that these may include factors such as social isolation, poverty, lack of structured daily activity, lack of adult role responsibility, living in areas with high drug availability, and association with people who already misuse drugs.|$|E

25|$|Jefferson {{continued}} {{to struggle with}} debt after serving as president. He used his hundreds of slaves as collateral to his creditors. This debt was due to his lavish lifestyle, long construction and changes to Monticello, imported goods, art, etc. He frequently entertained house guests for extended periods at Monticello, and served them expensive wines and food. He also incurred debt in helping support his only surviving daughter, Martha Jefferson Randolph, and her large family. She had separated from her husband, who had become abusive from alcoholism <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> (according to different sources), and brought her family to live at Monticello.|$|E

40|$|SAGE Publications. Little {{is known}} about the role of age and gender in the {{association}} between psychosomatic symptoms <b>and</b> common <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> in Ghanaian adolescents. This cross-sectional study examined age and gender as moderators between psychosomatic symptoms <b>and</b> common <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> using data from a school-based survey (N = 770). Males reported higher psychosomatic symptoms <b>and</b> common <b>mental</b> <b>illness,</b> while younger adolescents reported higher common <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> only. Psychosomatic symptoms were positively associated with common <b>mental</b> <b>illness,</b> but age <b>and</b> gender did not moderate this association.

25|$|Prisons in wealthy, {{industrialized nations}} provide {{medical care for}} most of their inmates. Additionally, prison medical staff {{play a major role in}} monitoring, organizing, and {{controlling}} the prison population through the use of psychiatric evaluations and interventions (psychiatric drugs, isolation in mental health units, etc.). Prison populations are largely from poor minority communities that experience greater rates of chronic illness, substance abuse, <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> than the general population. This leads to a high demand for medical services, and in countries such as the US that don't provide free healthcare, prison is often the first place that people are able to receive medical treatment (which they couldn't afford outside).|$|E
25|$|Studies {{show that}} there is a direct {{correlation}} between poverty <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b> The lower the socioeconomic status of an individual the higher the risk of mental illness. Impoverished people are actually two to {{three times more likely to}} develop mental illness than those of a higher economic class. This increased risk for psychiatric complications remains consistent for all individuals among the impoverished population, regardless of any in-group demographic differences that they may possess. These families must deal with economic stressors like unemployment and lack of affordable housing, which can lead to mental health disorders. A person's socioeconomic class outlines the psychosocial, environmental, behavioral, and biomedical risk factors that are associated with mental health.|$|E
25|$|A {{very large}} {{percentage}} of schizophrenics smoke tobacco {{as a form of}} self-medication. The high rate of tobacco use by the mentally ill is a major factor in their decreased life expectancy, which is about 25 years shorter than the general population. Following the observation that smoking improves condition of people with schizophrenia, in particular working memory deficit, nicotine patches had been proposed as a way to treat schizophrenia. Some studies suggest that a link exists between smoking <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illness,</b> citing the high incidence of smoking amongst those suffering from schizophrenia and the possibility that smoking may alleviate some of the symptoms of mental illness, but these have not been conclusive. In 2015, a meta-analysis found that smokers were at greater risk of developing psychotic illness.|$|E

The portrayal of <b>mental</b> health professionals <b>and</b> psychiatric treatment is also discussed. The theories explaining the relationship of how media influences the attitudes and behavior are discussed. Media has also been suggested to be a risk factor for the genesis or exacerbation of <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> like eating disorders and substance use disorders. The potential use of media to understand the psychopathology and plight of those with psychiatric disorders is referred to. The manner in which media can be used as a tool for change to reduce the stigma surrounding <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> is explored...|$|R
