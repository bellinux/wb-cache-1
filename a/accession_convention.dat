Malaysia, as an acknowledged 'moderate' Muslim majority state, provides an instructive case study, particularly with its <b>accession</b> to the <b>Convention</b> on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1995, with reservations which were partially withdrawn in 1998.

In recent years, robust public debate about Islam and women's rights, voiced from multiple perspectives, has surfaced as participants seek to influence the law and policy on women's issues. There is no uniform perspective on these issues and this article demonstrates the diversity of views expressed within Malaysia, informed by personal interviews the author conducted with various political leaders and representatives of local women's NGOs. It also demonstrates how robust internal discourse reveals the ambivalences and divergent views extant within the Muslim community about women's rights issues both on the global and national level. A shared internal consensus, facilitated by a participatory ethos, facilitates cross-cultural dialogue between the Islamic community and the international human rights community. This helps forge a stronger shared basis for human rights, towards the goal of promoting the legitimacy of universal human rights norms to local communities defined by religious affiliation...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{intellectual}} property in the legal systems of individual states is constantly expanded, also because of <b>accession</b> to international <b>conventions,</b> treaties and agreements. Primarily however, the subject scope increases steadily as {{a growing number of}} so-called intellectual subjects achieve the status of non-material property, to which exclusive rights apply. The exclusive right to a plant variety, regulated by the Law of June 26, 2003 on the legal protection of plant varieties, on grounds of a model laid down in the International UPOV Convention, is regarded an industrial property law. The breeder’s right should thus be considered a neighbouring right or one related to the rights gathered under the collective title of industrial property. The WTO/TRIPS Agreement creates an international standard of protection for plant varieties, obligating states to protect plant varieties by patents, sui generis rights or a combination of the two. The prohibition of patenting plant and animal varieties within the European Patent Convention, directive 98 / 44 /EC on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions and domestic legislation on protection of industrial property – do not mean that the exclusion refers to plants and animals per se. Exclusion from patenting does not concern microbiological cultivation nor the effects of this which allows patent protection of inventions from the sphere of biotechnology (biotechnological inventions). It appears that the decisive factor, significant for the further development of exclusive rights to variety, is the extent of protection awarded to its cultivator, which at the same time will condition the legal situation of the variety’s user (land possessor) ...|$|R
