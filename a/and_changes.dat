Until now, a number of researches on language variation <b>and</b> <b>change</b> have been done from various perspectives: The sociolinguistic research, specifically {{from the perspective of the}} variationist approach (Labov 1963 et seq., Weinreich et al. 1968), has revealed much about language variation <b>and</b> <b>change,</b> particularly with respect to phonological aspects, focusing on various internal and external factors that govern the phenomena by the quantitative method. However, the formalization of the mechanism of language variation <b>and</b> <b>change</b> is insufficient; the generative grammatical approach (Chomsky 1957) can give a formal account of the phenomena based on the grammatica...|$|R

40|$|Purpose â The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} to a better comprehension of the relationships between corporate social performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) through the development of a dynamic model that links together innovation <b>and</b> <b>change,</b> stakeholder cohesion, <b>and</b> competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach â Theory building through the development of eight testable propositions. Findings â Stakeholder cohesion may have a âdark sideâ to the extent it results in inertia <b>and</b> resistance to <b>change,</b> thus reducing propensity to innovation <b>and</b> <b>change.</b> The latter, in turn, are vital for both competitive advantage and stakeholder cohesion itself. Therefore, propensity to innovation <b>and</b> <b>change</b> is the pivotal variable that helps explain the complex, non linear, often inextricable relationships between CSP and CFP. Furthermore, external (environmental dynamism) and internal (firm culture) variables moderate, respectively, the impact of innovation <b>and</b> <b>change</b> on firm performance and the impact of firm performance on its propensity to innovation <b>and</b> <b>change...</b>|$|R
40|$|Organisational design, {{development}} <b>and</b> <b>change</b> {{management is}} {{about dealing with}} the effectiveness and efficiency of organisations. Organisational design, development <b>and</b> <b>change</b> management practitioners use systematic strategies and approaches to improve the productivity of organisations and the well-being of individuals. In order to do this, the organisational design, development <b>and</b> <b>change</b> management practitioner {{must be able to}} manage customers, competition, <b>change,</b> relationships <b>and</b> processes. There is a need to understand the impacts of successful organisational design, development <b>and</b> <b>change</b> management implementations as they influence the success of an organisation. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore practitionersâ knowledge and experiences of organisational design, development <b>and</b> <b>change</b> management implementation. The objectives included explorations of practitionersâ experiences working on organisational design, development <b>and</b> <b>change</b> management implementations. The study is qualitative, exploratory research. Data was collected by means of face-to-face interviews guided by a semi structured interview schedule. Participantsâ were practitioners working in the field of organisational design, development <b>and</b> <b>change</b> management. The study used non-probability (non-random) purposive, snowball sampling. The data was analysed using thematic content analysis to identify themes and sub themes in the data. The findings indicate what organisational design, development <b>and</b> <b>change</b> management involves, what the benefits are and the successes and challenges practitioners have encountered during implementation. The macroeconomic environment in which organisations operate is ever changing and in order to keep up, organisations need to call on experienced practitioners to assist in managing the change. The implications of the results will assist the industry as well as organisations to understand the value organisational design, development <b>and</b> <b>change</b> management implementations in enabling business strategies and driving organizations to achieve its business objective thus promoting and growing the discipline and practice. These insights will also contribute to the discipline and the availability of such data will assist future practitioners to be more effective in their roles...|$|R
