5|$|Fleas lay tiny, white, oval eggs. The larvae <b>are</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> pale, have {{bristles}} {{covering their}} worm-like bodies, lack eyes, and have mouth parts adapted to chewing. The larvae feed on organic matter, especially the feces of mature fleas, which contain dried blood. Adults feed only on fresh blood.|$|E

5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is high and}} {{triangular}} with a pointed apex, originating forward of the free rear tips of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is relatively large and originates over the anal fin. No ridge runs between the dorsal fins. The pectoral fins <b>are</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> sickle-shaped, with pointed tips. The dermal denticles <b>are</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> overlapping, each bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. Living finetooth sharks are a distinctive dark bluish-gray above and white below, with a faint pale stripe on the flanks and no prominent fin markings. Some individuals from Florida have green eyes. Males average 1.6m (5.2ft) in length and females 1.7m (5.4ft); the largest shark on record was 1.9m (6.2ft) long.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the pink whipray is diamond-shaped and thick at the center, measuring about 1.1â€“1.2 times wider than long. The outer {{corners of the}} disc are angular. The snout forms a very obtuse angle, with the tip barely protruding. The small, widely spaced eyes are followed by larger spiracles. There is a short and broad curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin between the long, thin nostrils. The mouth is fairly small and surrounded by prominent furrows; the lower jaw has a small indentation in the middle. There are two large central and two tiny lateral papillae {{on the floor of}} the mouth. The teeth <b>are</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> arranged into pavement-like surfaces. Five pairs of gill slits are located beneath the disc. The pelvic fins <b>are</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> narrow.|$|E

5|$|While it {{is often}} weaker than most of its land counterparts, {{stronger}} versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur. Most waterspouts do not suck up water; they <b>are</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> weak rotating columns of air over water.|$|E
5|$|Wrens <b>are</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> {{inconspicuous}} birds, {{except for}} their loud songs. They have short wings {{and a thin}} downturned bill. Several species often hold their tails upright. All are insectivorous. Seven species have been recorded in Massachusetts.|$|E
50|$|The Anadolu <b>is</b> a <b>small</b> pony, {{standing}} between 12.1 and 13.3 hands high. The head <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> shows refinement. Both convex and concave profiles are {{found within the}} breed. The mouth <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> the nostrils <b>are</b> open and flexible, while the withers are somewhat low, the chest is narrow and the croup is sloped.|$|R

5|$|Wrens <b>are</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> {{inconspicuous}} birds, {{except for}} their loud songs. They have short wings and thin down-turned bills. There are about 80 species worldwide, with one breeding in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E

5|$|A broad muzzle {{is found}} on the river otter's flat head, and the ears are round and inconspicuous. The rhinarium is bare, with an obtuse, {{triangular}} projection. Eyes of the animal <b>are</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> placed anteriorly. A short, broad rostrum for exhaling and a long, broad cranium define the relatively flat skull. The river otter's nostrils and ears close during submersion, inhibiting water from entering them. Its vibrissae (whiskers) are long and thick, enhancing sensory perception underwater and on land.|$|E
5|$|Although Shetlands <b>are</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> slow-growing {{compared}} to commercial breeds, they are hardy, thrifty, easy lambers, adaptable and long-lived. The Shetland breed has survived for centuries in difficult conditions {{and on a}} poor diet, but they thrive in better conditions. Shetlands retain many of their primitive survival instincts, so they are easier to care for than many modern breeds.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reviews in}} the birding and ornithological press {{have often been}} favourable, there have been criticisms. Peter Kennerley, author and Asian bird expert, {{considered}} {{that some of the}} illustrations <b>are</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> garish or technically inaccurate. He also believes that the over-reliance on sometimes very old museum specimens and dismissal of the wealth of observational data filed by amateur travelling birders is a mistake, and states that many of the taxonomic decisions appear to be random choices, unsupported by published research.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the eyes}} of most microbat species <b>are</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, no species is blind. Microbats have mesopic vision, meaning that they can only detect light in low levels, whereas other mammals have {{photopic}} vision, which allows colour vision. Microbats may use their vision for orientation and while they are travelling between their roosting grounds and their feeding grounds, as echolocation is only effective over short distances. Some species can detect ultraviolet (UV). As the bodies of some microbats have distinct coloration, {{they may be able}} to discriminate colours.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, in which the nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which <b>are</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
5|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD), a hereditary kidney condition, {{is known to be}} associated with cerebral aneurysms in 8 percent of cases, but most such aneurysms <b>are</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> therefore unlikely to rupture. As a result, screening is only recommended in families with ADPKD where one family member has had a ruptured aneurysm.|$|E
