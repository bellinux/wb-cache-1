5|$|Calgary rebounded to {{make the}} playoffs for the next four seasons, {{including}} two consecutive division titles. However, they were knocked out {{in the first round of}} the playoffs each time. The 1994 and 1995 Division titles led to Game 7 overtime home defeats in the opening round to the Canucks and San Jose Sharks respectively. In the 1995–96 season, Nieuwendyk was traded to the Dallas Stars in <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>that</b> acquired Jarome Iginla. Iginla would make his Flames debut in the 1996 postseason during which the Flames again lost in the first round, a four-game sweep by the Blackhawks. In 1997, only two years after winning their second consecutive division title, the Flames missed the playoffs and would not return for seven years.

5|$|Despite his success, Cagney {{remained}} {{dissatisfied with}} his contract. He wanted {{more money for}} his successful films, but he also offered to take a smaller salary should his star wane. Warner Bros. refused, so Cagney once again walked out. He held out for $4000 a week, the same salary as Edward G. Robinson, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Kay Francis. Warner Bros. refused to cave in this time, and suspended Cagney. Cagney {{announced that he would}} do his next three pictures for free if they canceled the five years remaining on his contract. He also threatened to quit Hollywood and go back to Columbia University to follow his brothers into medicine.

The Marlins acquired him in the 1992 expansion draft, and he pitched in Florida until he was traded to the Padres mid-season in 1993 in <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>that</b> sent star Gary Sheffield to the Marlins. Hoffman recorded 20 saves in 1994 in his first season as Padres closer, and in the following years, he became the face of the franchise after Tony Gwynn retired. He collected at least 30saves each year for the next 14years, except for 2003 when he missed most of the year recovering from shoulder surgery. After San Diego did not re-sign him following the 2008 season, Hoffman pitched for two years with the Brewers before retiring after the 2010 season.|$|E

The lawsuit was settled in 2011, with Hidden Beach planning to release in August a compilation album The Original Jill Scott from the Vault, Vol. 1, {{the first in a}} planned album series of Scott's previously unreleased recordings. In 2010, Warner Bros. Records signed Scott to <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>that</b> gave her direct control over her marketing and promotion.

5|$|In February 1334 Montagu {{was sent}} on a {{commission}} to Edinburgh, to demand Edward Balliol's homage to Edward. In the great summer campaign of 1335, it was Montagu who provided the largest English contingent, with 180 men-at-arms and 136 archers. He was well rewarded for his contributions: after the Scots {{had been forced to}} cede the Lowlands, Montagu was granted the county of Peeblesshire. He was also allowed to buy the wardship of Roger Mortimer's son Roger for 1000 marks, <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>that</b> turned out to be very lucrative for Montagu. At this point, however, the fortunes were turning for the English in Scotland. Montagu campaigned in the north again in 1337, but the siege of Dunbar met with failure.

5|$|Manchester City's first {{transfer}} {{business of}} the season brought goalkeeper Ken Mulhearn to the club from Stockport County on 21 September, <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>that</b> involved City's back-up goalkeeper Alan Ogley moving in the opposite direction. Harry Dowd kept goal in the next match, a 1–0 defeat at Arsenal, but then dislocated a finger, prompting a debut for Mulhearn in the season's first Manchester derby. Mulhearn was reputedly so nervous before the match that Allison locked him in the medical room until he calmed down. Colin Bell scored the opener after five minutes, but two Bobby Charlton goals meant a win for Manchester United. In {{the second half of}} the match, Bowles exchanged punches with Brian Kidd, though neither man was sent off, largely thanks to the intervention of their respective captains. The derby loss was followed by a third consecutive defeat, at Sunderland.|$|E

5|$|Raphel was {{instrumental}} in coordinating the State Department's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Taliban shortly after its takeover of Kabul. A senior Unocal executive commented that the pipeline project would be far easier to implement with the Taliban in control, {{in reference to the}} need for central control in Afghanistan to undertake a project of the size, complexity and cost the Texas-based oil giant was considering. Unocal's consortium also included Saudi Arabia's Delta Oil, Pakistan's Crescent Group and Gazprom of Russia. The project involved building an 890-kilometer gas pipeline that would carry 1.9 billion cubic feet of gas to Pakistan each day. Unocal held detailed discussions with Taliban representatives in Houston in December 1997, striking <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>that</b> would later collapse under the weight of rising U.S. and Afghan domestic political pressures against the Taliban's record on human rights, education and treatment of women.|$|E
5|$|The CFL {{operated}} the Canadian Football Network, {{a coalition of}} private broadcasters that shared league games and the Grey Cup with the CBC, from 1987 to 1990. CBC then broadcast the championship game alone until 2007, when the CFL sold exclusive rights to all games, including the Grey Cup, to specialty channel The Sports Network (TSN) and its French-language sister station Réseau des sports (RDS), <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>that</b> was criticized by Canadians without cable access. Nonetheless, TSN and RDS achieved a record audience for the 2009 Grey Cup, with 6.1 million Canadians watching the game in its entirety, and over 14 million viewing {{at least part of}} the contest. Viewership has declined in recent years, and in 2014, about 33%, of Canadians watched at least some of the game, peaking at 5.1 million viewers in the fourth quarter.|$|E

Two of those picks, for the 1967 and 1968 drafts, were traded to the Minnesota Vikings in 1967 as part of a deal for quarterback Fran Tarkenton. During the 1974 season, the Giants dealt their 1975 first-round choice to the Dallas Cowboys for another quarterback, Craig Morton. In another case when the Giants used first-round draft picks to trade for a quarterback, the team {{acquired}} 2004 first overall pick Eli Manning from the San Diego Chargers, in <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>that</b> included their 2004 and 2005 first-round picks; the Giants had already selected Philip Rivers with the 2004 pick, the fourth in that year's draft. The Giants used multiple first-round selections in 1951, 1972, and 1984; in the second instance; they gained a selection by trading Tarkenton back to the Vikings.|$|E

The team entered November {{in the midst of}} a streak where they lost six of seven games. During the slump, rookie forward Brett Sutter was arrested in Scottsdale, Arizona, on charges that he assaulted a cab driver. Sutter apologized for the incident and his teammates issued a release expressing support, but he was demoted to Abbotsford a few days later. He was subsequently traded to the Carolina Hurricanes along with Ian White in exchange for defenceman Anton Babchuk and forward Tom Kostopoulos in <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>that</b> was being discussed by the two teams prior to Sutter's legal troubles.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, Michael Jackson {{purchased}} ATV for {{a reported}} $47.5 million.

5|$|A major {{report was}} {{published}} in January 1998 by The New York Times detailing Zardari's vast corruption and misuse of public funds. The report discussed $200 million in kickbacks to Zardari and a Pakistani partner for a $4 billion contract with French military contractor Dassault Aviation, in <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>that</b> fell apart only when the Bhutto government was dismissed. It contained details of two payments of $5 million each by a gold bullion dealer {{in return for a}} monopoly on gold imports. It had information from Pakistani investigators that the Bhutto family had allegedly accrued more than $1.5 billion in illicit profits through kickbacks in virtually every sphere of government activity. It also reported Zardari's mid-1990s spending spree, which included {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} spent on jewellery. The arrangements made by the Bhutto family for their wealth relied on Western property companies, Western lawyers, and a network of Western friends. The report described how Zardari had arranged secret contracts, painstaking negotiations, and the dismissal of anyone who objected to his dealings.|$|E
