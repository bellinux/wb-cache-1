5|$|When <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> <b>he,</b> {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, {{felt about}} Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E
5|$|They {{meet with}} the Valtian ambassador, Chancellor Alrik (Mickey Cottrell), who is uninterested in the {{marriage}} and wants to pursue trade agreements. With the arrangements made, Picard visits Kamala to say goodbye; she tells him that she has permanently bonded with him instead of Alrik. Kamala explains that he has changed her for the better, and will continue in her duty for her people to marry Alrik. At the wedding ceremony, Picard escorts Kamala {{down the aisle and}} watches as she marries another. After the newlyweds have returned to the planet, Picard says goodbye to Briam in the transporter room. When <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> resisted Kamala, the expression on Picard's face reveals how much of a struggle it has been and how much he feels he has lost.|$|E
5|$|Twelve-year-old Keith Bennett {{vanished}} {{on his way}} to his grandmother's {{house in}} Longsight, Manchester, early in the evening of 16 June 1964, four days after his birthday. Hindley lured him into her Mini Pick-up—which Brady was sitting in the back of—by asking for the boy's help in loading some boxes, after which she said she would drive him home. She drove to a lay-by on Saddleworth Moor as she and Brady had previously arranged, and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove. Hindley kept watch, and after about 30minutes or so Brady reappeared, alone and carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier. When Hindley <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> had killed Bennett, Brady said that he had sexually assaulted the boy and strangled him with a piece of string.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{his arrest}} on {{information}} from a Stationers' Company informant, Lilburne was brought before the Court of Star Chamber. Instead of being charged with an offence he was <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> pleaded. In his examinations he refused to take the oath known as the ex officio oath (on the grounds {{that he was not}} bound to incriminate himself), and thus called in question the court's usual procedure. As he persisted in his contumacy, he was sentenced on 13 February 1638 to be fined £500, whipped, pilloried, and imprisoned till he obeyed.|$|E
25|$|In October 2000, Zimmer {{performed}} live {{in concert}} {{for the first}} time with an orchestra and choir at the 27th Annual Flanders International Film Festival in Ghent. While writing the score for The Last Samurai, Zimmer felt that his knowledge of Japanese music was extremely limited. He began doing extensive research, but the more he studied, the less he felt he knew. Finally, Zimmer took what he had written to Japan for feedback and was shocked when he was <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> knew so much about Japanese music.|$|E
25|$|Musicians {{were free}} to join in, but such collaborations were often {{short-lived}} if the contributions were lacking the proper spirit: notable jazz saxophonist Steve Lacy sat in with the group but was quickly asked to stop playing. Observers were welcome, provided they were silent and didn't disturb the proceedings. American saxophonist Ornette Coleman was asked to leave after he continually talked during one performance; Beatles member Paul McCartney once sat quietly through an early AMM session. When <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> liked the music he said they went on too long.|$|E

The questions touched on his personal views of LGBT, LGBT people adopting children and hurdles for LGBT Singaporeans. He was <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> would react if one of his grandchildren turned out to be homosexual. He replied that he would accept his grandchild because homosexuality is a genetic code. One of the questions asked was if LGBT couples could adopt children. He did not think LGBT people were suited to bringing up a child as they have no maternal instinct aroused by the process of pregnancy.|$|E
