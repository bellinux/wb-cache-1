25|$|Because the INTJ type is introverted, {{however, the}} J instead {{indicates}} that the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>function</b> is the preferred judging function (extraverted thinking). The INTJ type introverts the dominant perceiving function (introverted intuition). The tertiary function is feeling and the inferior function is extraverted sensing.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notable}} {{addition}} of Myers and Briggs ideas to Jung's original thought is their concept {{that a given}} type's fourth letter (J or P) indicates a person's preferred extraverted function, which is the dominant function for extraverted types and the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>function</b> for introverted types.|$|E
25|$|According to Jung, {{people use}} all four {{cognitive}} functions. However, one function is generally {{used in a}} more conscious and confident way. This dominant function {{is supported by the}} secondary (<b>auxiliary)</b> <b>function,</b> and to a lesser degree the tertiary function. The fourth and least conscious function is always the opposite of the dominant function. Myers called this inferior function the shadow.|$|E

25|$|In any {{discretised}} wavelet transform, {{there are}} only a finite number of wavelet coefficients for each bounded rectangular region in the upper halfplane. Still, each coefficient requires the evaluation of an integral. In special situations this numerical complexity can be avoided if the scaled and shifted wavelets form a multiresolution analysis. This means that there has to exist an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>function,</b> the father wavelet φ in L2(R), and that a is an integer. A typical choice is a = 2 and b = 1. The most famous pair of father and mother wavelets is the Daubechies 4-tap wavelet. Note that not every orthonormal discrete wavelet basis can be associated to a multiresolution analysis; for example, the Journe wavelet admits no multiresolution analysis.|$|E

2500|$|The {{interaction}} of two, three, or four preferences {{is known as}} [...] "type dynamics". Although type dynamics has received little or no empirical support to substantiate its viability as a scientific theory, Myers and Briggs asserted that {{for each of the}} 16 four-preference types, one function is the most dominant and is likely to be evident earliest in life. A secondary or <b>auxiliary</b> <b>function</b> typically becomes more evident (differentiated) during teenage years and provides balance to the dominant. In normal development, individuals tend to become more fluent with a third, tertiary function during mid-life, while the fourth, inferior function remains least consciously developed. The inferior function is often considered to be more associated with the unconscious, being most evident in situations such as high stress (sometimes referred to as being in the grip of the inferior function).|$|E
