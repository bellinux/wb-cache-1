5|$|Overall, the German {{units were}} less {{numerous}} than the Polish forces, their equipment worn and supplies inferior. Polish sources describe the Germans as more experienced, however the German sources accentuate their mixed structure of experienced soldiers <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced</b> recruits of Hitlerjugend and Volkssturm units.|$|E
5|$|Having {{pushed back}} U.S. forces at both Osan and Pyongtaek, the North Korean 4th Infantry Division, {{supported}} by {{elements of the}} North Korean 105th Armored Division, continued their advance down the Osan–Chonan road, up to 12,000 men strong under division commander Lee Kwon Mu in two infantry regiments supported by dozens of tanks. They were well trained, well equipped, and had high morale following previous victories, giving them advantages over the poorly trained <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced</b> Americans.|$|E

50|$|The U.S. Navy safety {{investigation}} into the accident, not intended for public release but which was obtained by the Honolulu Advertiser in July 2009, listed several contributing factors for the grounding. The factors included a misinterpreted navigation system, a sleep-deprived commanding officer, faulty equipment <b>and</b> an <b>inexperienced</b> <b>and</b> dysfunctional bridge team.|$|R
5|$|He sent a {{telegraph}} to {{his friend}} the diplomat Hugh Carless, then due to take up his position as First Secretary in Tehran later that year, requesting he accompany him on an expedition to Northern Afghanistan. They were poorly prepared <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced,</b> but Newby and Carless vowed to attempt Mir Samir, a glacial and then unclimbed 20,000 foot peak in the Hindu Kush.|$|E
5|$|Most {{recreation}} {{takes place}} around Lake Inari, although {{a limited number}} of visitors hike into the fells. The reserve is a demanding hiking area <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced</b> hikers are recommended to avoid traversing the wilderness. The freedom to roam grants everyone the right to hike, ski and short-term camping everywhere in the area. The park can be accessed from National Road 971 and 969; public transport is available to Nellim.|$|E
5|$|PedroII {{planned a}} trip to Europe which would result in his absence for almost a year. In his place, his {{daughter}} and heir Isabel became Regent. Since she was young <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced,</b> Rio Branco could not rely on Imperial intervention to help push through passage of the Emperor's anti-slavery legislation. By this time, the Conservative elders were no more, and he had risen to lead the Conservative Party. Rio Branco formed his Cabinet on 7 March 1871 and it would last until 25 June 1875—the second longest in the Empire's history. Rio Branco became the longest-serving prime minister. With a single exception, all ministers he appointed were young <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced.</b> Only one achieved prominence: João Alfredo Correia de Oliveira, who as President of the Council of Ministers would, on 13 May 1888, secure passage {{of the law that}} extinguished the last vestiges of slavery in Brazil.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Company H {{attempted}} to deploy at five-yard intervals {{along the ridge}} while still mounted. This proved disastrous, since the horses were flighty <b>and</b> the troop <b>inexperienced</b> <b>and</b> unable to shoot from {{the backs of their}} terrified horses.|$|R

5|$|The club played Warrington {{over the}} 2008 Christmas holidays, as a {{pre-season}} friendly to Wigan's 2009 season. Tomkins claimed a hat-trick {{as the team}} swept aside a young <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced</b> Warrington side 44–4. Tomkins also featured in the club's two other fixtures during the pre-season, firstly against Huddersfield and then against Leigh. For 2009, Tomkins was given the number 25 jersey.|$|E
5|$|A large workhouse such as Whitechapel, {{accommodating}} {{several thousand}} paupers, employed {{a staff of}} almost 200; the smallest may only have had a porter and perhaps an assistant nurse {{in addition to the}} master and matron. A typical workhouse accommodating 225 inmates had a staff of five, which included a part-time chaplain and a part-time medical officer. The low pay meant that many medical officers were young <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced.</b> To add to their difficulties, in most unions they were obliged to pay out of their own pockets for any drugs, dressings or other medical supplies needed to treat their patients.|$|E
5|$|According to Mifune, in 1904 Maeda lost to Yoshitake Yoshio by hane goshi, after {{defeating}} three adversaries in succession, but in {{a following}} tsukinami-shiai defeated eight adversaries {{in a row and}} was awarded the rank of 4th dan (yondan). Mifune also states that Maeda {{was one of the most}} vigorous promoters of judo, although not by teaching the art, instead generating recognition of judo through his many combats with contenders from other disciplines. Maeda treated experienced <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced</b> students alike, throwing them as if in real combat. He reasoned that this behavior was a measure of respect towards his students, but it was often misunderstood and frightened many youngsters, who would abandon him in favor of other professors.|$|E
40|$|The study {{addresses}} whether differently ordered {{accounts receivable}} workprograms and task experience relate {{to differences in}} judgments, confidence levels, and recall ability. The study also assesses how treated <b>and</b> untreated <b>inexperienced</b> <b>and</b> experienced auditors store and recall accounts receivable workprogram steps in memory in a laboratory environment. Additionally, the question whether different levels of experienced auditors can effectively be manipulated is also addressed...|$|R

5|$|Friedrich der Grosse {{was ordered}} by the Imperial Navy from the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel; her keel was laid in 1871 under {{construction}} number 1. The ship was launched on 20 September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 22 November 1877. Although laid down a year before her sister , Friedrich der Grosse was not completed until a year after; this was because she was built at a newly established <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced</b> Imperial Dockyard, while Preussen was built by AG Vulcan, an experienced private shipbuilder. The ship cost the German government 7,303,000gold marks.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to their British counterparts, the French Navy {{was in a}} state of confusion. Although the quality of the fleet's ships was high, the fleet hierarchy was riven by the same crises that had torn through France since the Revolution five years earlier. Consequently, the high standard of ships and ordnance was not matched by that of the available crews, which were largely untrained <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced.</b> With the Terror resulting in the death or dismissal of many senior French sailors and officers, political appointees and conscripts – many of whom had never been to sea at all, let alone in a fighting vessel – filled the Atlantic fleet.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{signed with}} the Indianapolis Colts in 1988 {{in order to provide}} {{experience}} to a young <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced</b> Colts squad. During his time with the Colts, Johnson was used as a part-time starter in a role similar to his final few years with the Packers. He played in ten games that year, recording three sacks and played in all 16 games the following year, recording 8.5 sacks. He joined the Houston Oilers in 1990, where he played in all 16 games, starting three, and was credited with 2.5 sacks. After playing two games for the Oilers in 1991, Johnson retired.|$|E
50|$|A United States Navy {{investigation}} {{found that the}} grounding {{was caused by a}} combination of a misread navigation system, a sleep-deprived commanding officer, broken equipment, <b>and</b> an <b>inexperienced</b> <b>and</b> dysfunctional bridge team. The ships commanding officer, Captain John Carroll, was relieved of duty and disciplined. Three other officers and one enlisted sailor were also disciplined. The Navy reattached 5,400 coral colonies in an attempt to repair damage to the reef.|$|R

5|$|Moore {{was left}} with a weak side of young <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced</b> players which would stumble to a franchise-worst record of only 3 wins against 10 losses during the 2008 Super 14 season, and {{finished}} as the lowest-placed New Zealand team on the table. Jimmy Cowan, one of the team's few bright spots through this period, was appointed team captain for 2009, but things would improve little over the following two seasons as the team again limped to the worst record of the New Zealand clubs. When Moore was released as coach following the 2010 season, the franchise had compiled a record of only 10 wins against 29 losses in three seasons under his leadership.|$|E
5|$|Polyaenus's {{accounts}} {{have led}} some modern historians to tentatively propose the following {{synthesis of the}} battle. After the general engagement had been in progress for some time, Philip had his army perform a wheeling manoeuver, with the right wing withdrawing, and the whole line pivoting around its centre. At the same time, wheeling forward, the Macedonian left wing attacked the Thebans on the Greek right and punched {{a hole in the}} Greek line. On the Greek left, the Athenians followed Philip, their line becoming stretched and disordered; the Macedonians then turned, attacked and routed the tired <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced</b> Athenians. The Greek right wing, under the assault of the Macedonian troops under Alexander's command, then also routed, ending the battle.|$|E
5|$|Rio Branco {{attended}} Brazil's Naval School {{and became}} a midshipman in 1841. Later that year he was enrolled in the Army's Military Academy, eventually becoming an instructor there. Rather than continue {{to serve in the}} military, he became a politician in the Liberal Party. In 1845, he was elected a member of the provincial house of representatives of Rio de Janeiro province, site of the national capital of the same name. Rio Branco rose to power within the province under the tutelage of Aureliano Coutinho, Viscount of Sepetiba—a veteran politician who held tremendous influence over the young <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced</b> Emperor PedroII. He temporarily abandoned politics after Aureliano Coutinho's fall from grace and the subsequent dissolution of the Liberal Party.|$|E

5|$|The Australian {{team for}} the event was a young <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced</b> foursome. Mark Tonelli was the oldest {{at the age of}} 23, {{followed}} by Mark Kerry, who turned 21 a month after the Olympics. Both were attending their second Olympics, while Peter Evans and Neil Brooks were 18 and 17 respectively and had never represented Australia at the Commonwealth, World Championship or Olympic level. Evans and Brooks were from Western Australia, a state that had never been prominent in Australian swimming. The team members had some contact prior to their Olympic selection; Brooks' family had billeted Tonelli in 1976 when the Australian Olympic team held a training camp in Perth. Brooks cited his experience with Tonelli as a motivating factor in his career.|$|E
5|$|The Flames hired Cliff Fletcher, {{formerly}} of the St. Louis Blues, {{to serve as the}} team's general manager. Former Montreal Canadiens player Bernie Geoffrion was hired as the team's head coach. The team stocked its roster via an expansion draft held on June 6, 1972. Fletcher focused on goaltending, choosing Phil Myre with his first selection and rookie Dan Bouchard with his second. Fletcher drafted a competent roster, but one that was young <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced.</b> Two days later, the Flames selected Jacques Richard as the second overall pick in the 1972 NHL Amateur Draft.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the war Solti's luck changed dramatically. He was {{appointed}} musical director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1946. In normal circumstances this prestigious post would have been an unthinkable appointment for a young <b>and</b> <b>inexperienced</b> conductor, but the leading German conductors such as Wilhelm Furtwängler, Clemens Krauss and Herbert von Karajan were prohibited from conducting pending the conclusion of denazification proceedings against them. Under Solti's direction, the company rebuilt its repertoire and began to recover its pre-war eminence. He benefited from the encouragement of the elderly Richard Strauss, in whose presence he conducted Der Rosenkavalier. Strauss was reluctant to discuss his own music with Solti, but gave him advice about conducting.|$|E
50|$|Specialist-baiting or Spetseedstvo (Спецеедство) was a sociological {{phenomena}} in the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s where proletarian and young party members attacked Specialists and Professionals, {{causing them to}} be politically purged from the workplace, <b>and</b> allowing young <b>inexperienced</b> <b>and</b> uneducated workers to take these work positions.
