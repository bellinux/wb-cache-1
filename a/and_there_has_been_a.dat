5|$|In Southeast Asia the {{continental}} area (Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam) generally practices Theravada Buddhism. Most of insular Southeast Asia (namely Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia) practices mostly Sunni Islam. The {{rest of the}} insular region (Philippines and East Timor) practices mostly Roman Catholic Christianity and Singapore practises mostly Mahayana Buddhism. Significant long-distance labor migration {{that occurred during the}} late 19th into the early 20th century provided many different types of ethnic diversity. Relations between the indigenous population of the region arose from regional variations of cultural and linguistic group. During this time immigrant minorities, especially the Chinese, developed as well. Although there were extreme political differences for each minority and religion, they were still legitimate members of political communities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> significant amount of unity throughout history. This differs from both nearby East and South Asia.|$|E

25|$|The metres used in Persian have {{traditionally}} been analysed in terms of Arabic metres, from which {{they are supposed to}} have been adapted.

In 2005, the Scottish Executive put the collective Hebrides routes out to competitive tender, with the Dunoon route being a separate tender.

25|$|Catholic {{tradition}} {{holds that}} the Basilica is the burial site of Saint Peter, one of Jesus's Apostles and also the first Pope. Saint Peter's tomb is supposedly directly below the high altar of the Basilica. For this reason, many Popes have been interred at St. Peter's since the Early Christian period, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> church on this site {{since the time of}} the Roman emperor Constantine the Great. Construction of the present basilica, which would replace Old St. Peter's Basilica from the 4th century CE, began on 18 April 1506 and was completed on 18 November 1626.|$|E
25|$|By 1400, most English {{and some}} Scottish people used {{surnames}}, but many Scottish and Welsh {{people did not}} adopt surnames until the 17th century, or even later. Henry VIII (ruled 1509–1547) ordered that marital births be recorded under the surname of the father. In England and cultures derived from there, there {{has long been a}} tradition for a woman to change her surname upon marriage from her birth name to her husband's family name. (See Maiden and married names.) The first known instance in the United States of a woman insisting on the use of her birth name was that of Lucy Stone in 1855; <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> general increase in the rate of women using their birth name. This has gone through periods of flux, however, and the 1990s saw a decline in the percentage of name retention among women. As of 2006, more than 80% of American women adopted the husband's family name after marriage.|$|E

An unnamed western diplomat said the recommendations timing was likely due to 14 August protest plans and the increasing violence.

It was presented by Brian Conley, but was not broadcast; a series was not produced. Rosencrantz spoke of the pilot in 2011, [...] "I didn't believe {{people would like to}} see someone win a vast sum of money, with no skills at all involved. Second, gambling is not a spectator sport, you get an adrenaline rush from participating in it." [...] Richard Holloway, who worked with FremantleMedia at the time of producing the pilot, said, [...] "It was a novel idea, you could win a million pounds eventually, I was surprised it didn't go to series." [...] Rosencrantz left ITV in 2006, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> significant turnover in staff since the pilot was originally put together.|$|E
