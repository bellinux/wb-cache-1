25|$|Not {{much can}} be {{determined}} about Pacificus from contemporary documents, as few survive from his time. His existence is proved {{by at least one}} private document bearing his <b>autograph</b> <b>signature</b> from 809, as well as possibly a second similar document from 814. These documents relate to the properties held by the schola sacerdotum (a school for priests) he is credited with founding in Verona. There are several other charters or documents claimed to have been written or signed by Pacificus, but their authenticity is currently a matter of debate. In addition there are several marginalia believed to have been written by Pacificus on manuscripts from Church's Veronese archives, as well as numerous manuscripts attributed to him.|$|E

60|$|Mutual {{promises}} were interchanged {{between him}} and his master, Stephen on his knees; the indentures were signed, for Quipsome Hal could with much ado produce an <b>autograph</b> <b>signature,</b> though his penmanship went no further, and the occasion was celebrated by a great dinner of the whole craft at the Armourers' Hall, to which the principal craftsmen who had been apprentices, such as Tibble Steelman and Kit Smallbones, were invited, sitting at a lower table, while the masters had the higher one on the dais, and a third was reserved for the apprentices after they should have waited on their masters--in fact it was an imitation of the orders of chivalry, knights, squires, and pages, and the gradation of rank was as strictly observed as by the nobility. Giles, considering the feast to be entirely in his honour, though the transfer of his indentures had been made at Salisbury, endeavoured to come out in some of his bravery, but was admonished that such presumption might be punished, the first time, at his master's discretion, the second time, by a whipping at the Hall of his Company, and the third time by six months being added to the term of his apprenticeship.|$|E

[Nicolai, Anekdoten, vi. 193.] Enough have turned up since, in the form of Correspondence with the King and otherwise: and it is certain the Crown-Prince did plan Farm-Buildings;--"both Carzig and Himmelstadt (Carzig now called FRIEDRICHSFELDE in consequence)," [...] [See Map] dim mossy Steadings, which pious Antiquarianism can pilgrim to if it likes, were built or rebuilt by him:--and it is remarkable withal how thoroughly instructed Friedrich Wilhelm shows himself in such matters; and how paternally delighted to receive such proposals of improvement introducible at the said Carzig and Himmelstadt, and to find young Graceless so diligent, and his ideas even good.

5000|$|In {{his second}} Consistory for the {{creation}} of cardinals, held on 19 May 1344, Pope Clement VI created two cardinals, Pierre Bertrand de Colombier and Nicolas de Besse. In his speech (collatio) after the discussion and decision, Pope Clement remarked, [...] "But what will you say about this Bishop of Limoges Nicholas? Truly we say what we said yesterday morning when we entered the Consistory, that we had thought so much about his promotion, and that we thought that the thing should not be. But on the petition of the whole College of Cardinals, with no dissenting vote, it seemed best to elevate him. There were cardinals who had said that they would not consent to the Bishop of Arras if we did not elevate this Nicholas. And therefore we have elevated him." [...] Cardinal Nicolas was assigned the Deaconry of Santa Maria in Via Lata. He was, however, habitually called Lemoviciensis, the Cardinal of Limoges. [...] On 2 December 1344, the new Cardinal was present at a Consistory at which the Pope issued a bull in favor of the Abbey of Jumièges. Fourteen cardinals subscribed, including Cardinal de Besse.

40|$|Vol. 3 has imprint: Paris, Imprimerie nationale.

M. Tisserand, "Ancienne bibliothèque de l'Hotel de Ville", (t. III, p. 181 - 300) was reissued as a separate volume of the "Histoire générale de Paris" the same year (1873) under title: La prémiére bibliothèque de l'Hotel de Ville de Paris (1760 - 1797). To this issue an "Avant propos" and index were added. The number of impressions taken of three plates illustrating this article seems to have been insufficient to supply both issues. Tisserand having taken care to have the separate issue supplied first one or the other or all three of the plates are usually lacking in t. III of the "Anciennes bibliothèques" where they are specified in the list of illustrations as no. LIII (port. of Turgot), LIX ("Les bienfaiteurs de la bibliothèque de la ville", 4 port. on 1 pl.), and LXII ("L'eveque de Callinique", port. of Nicolas de Livry). It may also be noted that although volume 3 is dated 1873, that part containing Tisserand's monograph (written 1869) must have been printed before 1871 : no reference is made by note or otherwise to the destruction of the library, May 24, 1871, during the Commune, a fact mentioned however in the "Avant propos" to the separate issue.
