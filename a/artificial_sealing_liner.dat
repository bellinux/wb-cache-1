40|$|The EC {{landfill}} directive defines {{in article}} 1 (1) a gen-eral aim ‘to reduce {{as far as}} possible negative effects on the environment, in particular the pollution of surface water, groundwater, soil and air, and on the global envi-ronment [ [...] . ] from landfilling of waste, during the whole life-cycle of the landfill. ’ The surface sealing has special importance as a long-term barrier in the realisa-tion of this ambitious goal. The surface sealing of a landfill serves as a long-last-ing barrier between the body of waste and the atmos-phere and biosphere. Its main tasks are to minimise infiltration of water into the landfill, to prevent the escape of landfill gas and dust, to facilitate landscaping and sustaining cultivation of the surface. According to German waste disposal and landfill regulations (TA Siedlungsabfall 1993), untreated municipal waste may only be deposited in landfills until the year 2005. Land-fills, which do not meet the standards of the EC landfill directive and its German counterpart, will have to stop operation by the year 2009. Therefore, during this dec-ade, a large number of landfills will have to be closed and will eventually have to be covered with an adequate surface sealing system. The basis for the design of surface sealing systems is given in the EC landfill directive and – for Germany – in the German ‘Deponieverordnung ’ of 2002. The ‘Deponieverordnung ’ gives specific regulations for a standard surface sealing system consisting of (for municipal solid waste landfills) from bottom to top: • <b>artificial</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>liner</b> (geomembrane; d> 2. 5 mm); • mineral sealing layer (d> 0. 5 m; k 0. 3 m; k> 1 × 10 – 3 m/s); • top soil cover (d> 1. 0 m). Alternative surface cover systems may be permitted...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{development}} of a separable, pressurized and linerless CFRP vessel (carbon fibre reinforced polymer) for DLR’s Eu:Cropis satellite mis-sion. Due to a biological payload, an internal pressure of one earth atmosphere is required. The Satellite will operate in low earth orbit (LEO) for a mission duration of two years. Special emphasis is set on the pressure-tightness of the whole vessel. Therefore, a shielding concept is neces-sary to avoid leakage after space debris impact. Fur-thermore, the manufacturing process has a significant influence to the permeability of the vessel’s CFRP shell.

40|$|A new {{approach}} for monitoring in fractured rock was demonstrated in a contaminated (trichloroethylene and metola-chlor) dolostone aquifer used for municipal water supply. The system {{consists of two}} related technologies: a continuous packer for temporary borehole <b>seals</b> (Flexible <b>Liner</b> Underground Technologies Ltd. [FLUTe] blank liner) and a depth-discrete multilevel monitoring system (MLS) (the Water FLUTe) for temporary or permanent monitoring. The continuous borehole liner consists of a urethane-coated nylon fabric tube custom sized to each hole. The FLUTe MLS consists of the same liner material with many depth-discrete intervals for monitoring hydraulic head and/or ground water quality. The FLUTe blank <b>liner</b> <b>seals</b> the entire borehole, prior to FLUTe multilevel installation, to prevent vertical cross connection while allow-ing borehole logging and testing. The FLUTe multilevel system also seals the entire borehole {{with the exception of}} each monitoring interval where the formation water has direct hydraulic connection to the pumping system via a thin permeable mesh sandwiched between the liner and the formation. The blank <b>sealing</b> <b>liners</b> and the multilevel systems were used in five boreholes ranging in diameter between 9. 6 and 14. 5 cm in the dolostone aquifer to depths of 150 m. The systems were cus-tom designed for each borehole and included between 12 and 15 monitoring intervals. The application demonstrated the ease of installation and removability and facilitated obtaining large data sets with minimal labor.

30|$|A dense {{sampling}} {{campaign was}} undertaken {{at the peak}} of the dry season (January 2012) during which 72 water samples were collected from over 13 communities (Fig.  1). These included 32 open wells and 14 ‘boreholes’ hereafter termed groundwater, 14 streams, 4 rivers, 5 dam waters, and 3 lakes (Lakes Bambili, Oku and Ber) hereafter called surface water. Surface water sources were collected under base flow conditions (no run-off influence) since the sampling was in the dry season. The locations and altitudes of the selected sampling points were identified in the field using a Garmin Vista CX GPS. New narrow mouth low-density polyethylene bottles (100  ml) and Duran glass bottles (500  ml) were used for stable isotopes and tritium (3 H) water sampling, respectively. The glass bottles contained screw caps bonded with polytetrafluoroethylene-coated silicone <b>seal</b> <b>liners.</b> In order to avoid contamination, the bottles were properly rinsed with distilled water and dried in the Laboratory. Further details on water sampling are described in Wirmvem (2014).

40|$|Objectives: To provide {{scientific}} {{evidence on the}} outcome {{of a large number of}} cases treated by SealBio over the longer follow-up period. Materials and Methods: One hundred and thirty-four teeth in 116 patients presenting with pulp and periapical disease were randomly recruited between 2009 and 2014. SealBio was performed, and cases were followed up at regular intervals up to 6 -year. Results: Of the total 134 teeth treated, 16 teeth could not be followed up and 9 cases failed (7. 62 % of cases). In only 4 cases (approximately 3. 38 % of cases), the failure could be directly attributed to endodontic causes. In the remaining 5 cases, coronal leakage from under the crown margins or dislodged restoration was found after 3 - 5 years of treatment. Conclusions: SealBio was found to be a successful, nonobturation, regeneration-based endodontic treatment protocol. By cell homing of endogenous stem cells, a biological seal rather than an <b>artificial</b> <b>seal</b> with gutta-percha and sealer cement is possible to achieve.

40|$|The capping {{system is}} one of the major {{structural}} elements in modern landfills. When using <b>artificial</b> <b>sealing</b> materials (e. g. a geomembrane) as the capping liner, the stability of the cover soils and integrity of the geosynthethics need to be assessed. Traditional design methods only consider uniform cover soil thickness with different degrees of saturation and seepage build-up (i. e. parallel submergency ratio). This paper proposes an analytical method which includes the seepage build-up in the stability analysis for the capping slope with a tapered cover soil profile, that is when cover soils become thicker from top to bottom. Both the parallel (modified) and horizontal seepage force build-up patterns have been considered and analysed. The proposed analytical methods are applied to a design case in which uniform thickness cover soils are considered. The results are comparable to those of the traditional methods and therefore they are verified. Parametric analyses have confirmed the tapered profile can effectively improve the capping slope stability and indicated that the interface shear strength (between the cover soil and the underlying geosynthetic) and cover soil shear strength have the most significant effects on the capping slope stability...|$|R
40|$|A {{cost-effective}} way {{of producing}} all-weather surfaces for cattle {{is to use}} a combined geotextile-gravel pad construction, which allows pavement depth to be reduced. This study sought to determine the pavement construction that would offer the least runoff, best drainage effect and highest quality runoff and drainage effluent after exposure to heavy precipitation under different manure loads in high animal density areas. The study also examined whether any pavement construction gave acceptable sealing to the underlying soil surface. Three different combinations of non-woven and woven geotextile together with two gravel fractions of 200 mm were exposed to 50 mm precipitation for 30 minutes and 15 kg of cattle manure under two manure regimes (manure removal and manure accumulation). Runoff, drainage effluent and leachate were flow measured and sampled in buckets as they exited their respective pipes for both regimes. The pad surface layer reduced runoff flow rate and stabilised drain flow throughout the experiments, confirming pad stability. Manure removal reduced total N, total P, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total solid (TS) concentrations in drainage effluent. One pad construction proved better at oxidising NO 2 -N and another at trapping TS. One pad construction met the <b>sealing</b> <b>liner</b> norm to the underlying soil. The drainage effluent produced was acceptable for wetland treatment.

Favourable environmental conditions for microbiological reduction of perchlorate were sought by infiltrating an electron donor-enriched water solution using drip irrigation underlying an airtight <b>sealing</b> <b>liner.</b> A vadose zone monitoring system (VMS) was used for real-time tracking of the percolation process, the penetration depth of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and the variation in perchlorate concentration across the entire soil depth. The experimental conditions for each infiltration event were adjusted according to insight gained from data obtained by the VMS in previous stages. Continuous monitoring of the vadose zone indicated that in the top 13  m of the cross section, perchlorate concentration is dramatically reduced from thousands of milligrams per litre to near-detection limits with a concurrent increase in chloride concentration. Nevertheless, in the deeper parts of the vadose zone (<  17  m), perchlorate concentration increased, suggesting its mobilization down through the cross section. Breakthrough of DOC and bromide at different depths across the unsaturated zone showed limited migration capacity of biologically consumable carbon and energy sources due to their enhanced biodegradation in the upper soil layers. Nevertheless, the increased DOC concentration with concurrent reduction in perchlorate and increase in the chloride-to-perchlorate ratio in the top 13  m indicate partial degradation of perchlorate in this zone. There was no evidence of improved degradation conditions in the deeper parts where the initial concentrations of perchlorate were significantly higher...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} programme {{is presented}} {{with the aim of}} characterising –from physical, microstructural and geotechnical perspectives– the main properties of compacted clay phyllites. These clay phyllites are widely used as waterproofing material for roofs in the Alpujarras (Andalusia, Spain), as <b>sealing</b> <b>liners</b> in irrigation ponds, and as core material of small earthen zoned dams. An exhaustive physical-characterisation programme on the powder fraction has been followed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), chemical analysis by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), thermal analysis, particle-size distribution analysis, consistency limits, and density of solid particles. From a microstructural standpoint, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) tests, as well as nitrogen-adsorption tests, were carried out to characterise the pore network and surface area of the material in both natural and compacted states. The geotechnical characterisation programme on the compacted material was focused on the water-permeability and water-retention properties, the volume change on soaking (swelling or collapse), the compressibility on loading, the shearstrength properties, and the mechanical-penetration properties. In this way, an important physical and hydro-mechanical data base is provided, which could help in evaluating the suitability for using this material {{in a wide range of}} earthen constructions (liners, road subgrades, embankments, core material in zoned dams). It has been found that the material contains illite, chlorite and quartz as the main components, and feldspar, iron oxide and interstratified illite–smectite as minor ones. Despite the presence of active clay minerals, the compacted material did not display an important swelling on soaking at low stresses, as a consequence of its low specific surface and low water-retention ability. The material exhibited good compaction properties and, consequently, low water permeability plus a stiff response on loading. Nevertheless, despite the low porosity attained on the dry-side compaction, the material underwent some collapse on soaking at stresses greater than 100 kPa.

40|$|The {{clogging}} of fine-porosity geotextiles by {{soil particles}} {{is considered to}} be a problem in applications of these fabrics to filtering of municipal and industrial effluents. However, the clogging phenomenon can be an advantage for certain purposes, such as the creation of near-watertight membranes for sealing manure holding tanks. The conceived advantages of non-woven needle-punctured geotextiles are that they are less expensive due to lower material quantity, they are more resistant to tensile stresses compared to impermeable plastics and concrete, and they are easily installed. This thesis describes experimental work on the permeability and clogging characteristics of a Non-woven Polyester Geotextile with three different porosities (13. 4, 19. 5 and 26. 0 mum) but the same hydraulic conductivity (Kw = 10 - 5 m/s), when subjected to different heads of cattle slurry at 1, 2 and 4 % total solids (TS) concentrations. The resulting infiltration rates were used to establish the effect of geotextile pore size and manure TS on geotextile sealing and to find the location of the seal, whether at the surface or within the geotextile. After 100 days of experimentation, the lowest infiltration rate of 1. 1 L/m 2 /d was reached with the 13. 4 mum geotextile. Manure TS had a significant effect on the sealing and at least 4 % TS was required to minimize the geotextile's infiltration rate. Clogging occurred within the pores, suggesting that the seal remains even after removing the manure. This advantage can be translated into economic benefit when fun cost comparisons with <b>sealing</b> <b>liners</b> such as geomembranes and concrete are undertaken. This research also reviews and analyzes the physical, chemical and biological processes leading to clogging of geotextiles as well as a cost-benefit comparison with the other sealing materials.

This paper reviews some recent contributions in terms of definition, phenomenology, and conceptual and empirical modeling approaches to <b>artificial</b> soil <b>sealing</b> with a special focus to urban areas of Europe. The works {{about the effects of}} soil sealing on soil functions are then considered, in particular those that affect the energy transfer, water and gas movements and the biota. Soil sealing is also examined as a tool for protecting some environmental compartment from contamination. In general, porosity, color, geometry of the materials used in the sealing of soils, the quality of sealed soil and aspect ratio of urban infrastructures are key aspects in preserving soil functions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the performance of}} closed crawl spaces, which had sealed foundation wall vents, a <b>sealed</b> polyethylene film <b>liner</b> and various insulation and drying strategies, to traditional wall-vented crawl spaces with perimeter wall vents and polyethylene film covering 100 % of the ground surface. The study was conducted at 12 owner-occupied, all electric, single-family detached houses with the same floor plan located on one cul-de-sac in the southeastern United States. Using the matched pairs approach, the houses were divided into three study groups of four houses each. Comparative data was recorded for each house to evaluate sub-metered heat pump energy consumption, relative humidity, wood moisture content, duct infiltration, house infiltration, temperature, radon, and bioaerosol levels. Findings indicated that in the humid conditions of the southeastern United States, a properly closed crawl space is a robust construction measure that produces a substantially drier crawl space and significantly reduces occupied space conditioning energy use on an annual basis...|$|R
40|$|Installation of {{impervious}} {{surfaces in}} urban areas has attracted increasing attention due to its potential hazard to urban ecosystems. Urban soils are suggested to have robust carbon (C) sequestration capacity; however, the C stocks and dynamics in the soils covered by impervious surfaces that dominate urban areas are still not well characterized. We compared soil organic C (SOC) densities and their stabilities under impervious surface, determined by a 28 -d incubation experiment, with those in open areas in Yixing City, China. The SOC density (0 – 20 cm) under impervious surfaces was, on average, 68 % lower than that in open areas. Furthermore, there was a significantly (P, 0. 05) positive correlation between the densities of SOC and total nitrogen (N) in the open soils, whereas the correlation was not apparent for the impervious-covered soils, suggesting that the <b>artificial</b> soil <b>sealing</b> {{in urban areas}} decoupled the cycle of C and N. Cumulative CO 2 -C evolved during the 28 -d incubation was lower from the impervious-covered soils than from the open soils, and agreed well with a first-order decay model (Ct = C 1 +C 0 (1 -e-kt)). The model {{results indicated that the}} SOC underlying capped surfaces had weaker decomposability and lower turnover rate. Our results confirm the unique character of urban SOC, especially that beneath impervious surface, and suggest that scientific and management views on regional SOC assessment may need to consider the role of urban carbon stocks...|$|R
