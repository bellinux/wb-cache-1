He is surprised by her appearance and then tells her about how she now almost has no htun left in her hair. He assures her that while she is certainly not part ogre, he believes one of her ancestors was a gnome, explaining her strange appearance and htun hair also the point that she can see htun if he holds her hand. She learns that the gnomes can illuse as well though they can't mimic different voices. After Aza has spent some time with the gnomes, Ivi appears, disguised as a gnome, and tricks Aza into eating a poisoned <b>apple.</b> Her <b>spirit</b> is taken back to the enchanted mirror, where she discovers that Ivi's actions have been manipulated by Skulni so that he can take a vacation when Ivi is killed since then Ivi's spirit would take Skulni's place and her spirit would be trapped in the mirror until Skulni returns. Aza manages to destroy the mirror and warn Ivi about Skulni's evil plans through the mirror; the mirror's destruction also removes Aza and Ivi's magically obtained beauty. Aza awakens back in Gnome Caverns with a newfound respect for herself. To her surprise, Ijori is also there, and he apologizes for not defending and believing her.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSheikh Sa'd od-Din Ahmad Ù Ansari, {{the son of}} Mawlana Abd ol-Ghaffar Ibn Abd ol-Karim, is a mystic of the 12 th and 13 th centuries AH. Sa'd od-Din was born in Kabul in {{the village}} called Yahya Yahyaee in 1140 AH and died {{in the same place}} in 1225 AH (Ansari, 1374 : 6). In his youth, he learned {{canonical}} law and theology from his father but was soon attracted to mysticism (Heravi, 1373, 43). After performing Hajj in between the years 1169 - 113 AH and getting permission to guide people from Naqshbandiyeh and Qaderiyeh mystic Sheikh Mohammad Saman Madani, he returned home and guided people untill {{the end of his life}} (Ansari, 1390 : 3). Sheikh Sa'd od-Din was well learned in Islamic studies, Arabic language, rhetoric and sciences of his time. He was also familiar with the works of poets such as 'Attar, Rumi, Hafez, Ibn Arabi and other great names of mysticism. He was attached to Rumi and Hafez and has quoted them frequently in his works. Sheikh Sa'd od-Din wrote thirty six books and treatises including seven Divans and two Masnavis in Persian; He also wrote a book entitled The Mine of Unity and treatisesÂ  such as "Greetings Noble Tatar", "Habl ol-Matin" and "The Elite" in Arabic. He composed some poems in Arabic as well. At least from 1174 AH Sheikh Sa'd od-Din started to bring changes to the ancient Persian poetry; thus his deconstruction made poetical form much similar to contemporary Persian poetry. However, due to political and cultural distance between Iran and Afghanistan, we did not have a chance to get familiar with his innovations. His innovations consist of the following: 1. Â Â Â Â Â  Refrained Masnavi (masnavi tarjee'band) : He changed masnavi in a way that we can call it refrained masnavi, a sample of which is included in the paper. It consists of fifteen stanzas: The first stanza with eight lines, the second stanza fifty four lines, the twelfth stanza eleven lines and the other stanzas having equal lines. The line between the first and the second stanza is different from other lines and each stanza is separated with two lines of masnavi. Â  In addition, each stanza is artistically connected to the other. 2. Â Â Â Â Â  Quatrain refrained masnavi (masnavi dobeiti tarjee'band) : It has nine stanzas each separated with a quatrain. 3. Â Â Â Â Â  Refrained tail-rhymed (mosammat mostazad trajee'band) : Another one of his innovations is in refrained tail-rhymed poem. It has nine stanzas each rhyming but unrhymed with other stanzas. In each hemistich in between stanzas repeated four times. Other forms consist of tail-rhymed parallel refrain, and multiple parallel refrain discussed in detail in the paper. References 1.
