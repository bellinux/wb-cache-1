5|$|After {{a period}} of time and under the {{appropriate}} environmental conditions, the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive stage of the life cycle. Fruit body formation is influenced by external factors such as season (which affects temperature and <b>air</b> <b>humidity),</b> nutrients and light. As fruit bodies develop they produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores, each containing a single haploid nucleus. The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruit bodies are produced is long lasting, and will continue to produce successive generations of fruit bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable.|$|E

25|$|Moisture: Snails {{thrive in}} damp but not {{waterlogged}} environments {{and thus a}} well-draining soil is required. Research indicates that water content around 80% of the carrying capacity of the soil and <b>air</b> <b>humidity</b> over 80% (during darkness) are the most favorable conditions. Many farmers use mist-producing devices to maintain proper moisture in the air and/or soil. Also, if the system contains alive vegetation, the leaves are to be periodically wet.|$|E

Other factors (e.g., temperature, light intensity, food preferences versus food supplied, etc.) also affect feeding. A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half green vegetable material and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.|$|E
25|$|The annual {{precipitation}} in Pirin is 600–700mm {{in the lower}} zones and 1000–1200mm in the higher. The rainfall occurs mostly in winter and spring, while summer is driest season. The <b>air</b> <b>humidity</b> is 60–75% in August and 80–85 % in December. In winter the precipitation is mainly snow, varying from 70–90% at the lower altitudes to 100% at higher. The average number of days with snow cover varies from 20–30 to 120–160. The highest thickness of the snow cover reaches 40–60cm at 1000–1800m in February and 160–180cm above 1800m in March (190cm on Vihren). In some winters the snow thickness can reach 250–350cm. Avalanches are frequent.|$|E
25|$|Velvet worms live in all {{tropical}} {{habitats and}} in the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere, showing a circumtropical and circumaustral distribution. Individual species are found in Central and South America; the Caribbean islands; equatorial West Africa and Southern Africa; northeastern India; Thailand; Indonesia and parts of Malaysia; New Guinea; Australia; and New Zealand. Fossils {{have been found in}} Baltic amber, indicating that they were formerly more widespread in the Northern Hemisphere when conditions were more suitable. All extant velvet worms are terrestrial (land-living) and prefer dark environments with high <b>air</b> <b>humidity.</b> They are found particularly in the rainforests of the tropics and temperate zones, where they live among moss cushions and leaf litter, under tree trunks and stones, in rotting wood or in termite tunnels. They also occur in unforested grassland, if there exist sufficient crevices in the soil into which they can withdraw during the day, and in subterranean caves. Two species live in caves, a habitat to which their ability to squeeze themselves into the smallest cracks makes them exceptionally well-adapted and in which constant living conditions are guaranteed. Since the essential requirements for cave life were probably already present prior to the settlement of these habitats, this may be described as exaptation. Agriculture has apparently made available new habitats for velvet worms; in any case, they are found in man-made cocoa and banana plantations in South America and the Caribbean. Because the danger of desiccation is greatest during the day and in dry weather, {{it is not surprising that}} velvet worms are usually most active at night and during rainy weather. Under cold or dry conditions, they actively seek out crevices in which they shift their body into a resting state. Velvet worms are negatively phototactical: they are repelled by bright light sources.|$|E

500|$|Italian {{folklore}} {{holds that}} porcini sprout {{up at the}} time of the new moon; research studies have tried to investigate more scientifically the factors that influence the production of fruit bodies. Although fruit bodies may appear any time from summer to autumn (June to November in the UK), their growth is known to be triggered by rainfall during warm periods of weather followed by frequent autumn rain with a drop in soil temperature. Above average rainfall may result in the rapid appearance of large numbers of boletes, in what is known in some circles as a [...] "bolete year". A 2004 field study indicated that fruit body production is enhanced by an open and sunny wood habitat, corroborating an earlier observation made in a Zimbabwean study; removal of the litter layer on the forest floor appeared to have a negative effect on fruit body production, but previous studies reported contradictory results. A Lithuanian study conducted in 2001 concluded that the maximal daily growth rate of the cap (about 21mm or 0.8in) occurred when the relative <b>air</b> <b>humidity</b> was the greatest, and the fruit bodies ceased growing when the <b>air</b> <b>humidity</b> dropped below 40%. Factors most likely to inhibit the appearance of fruit bodies included prolonged drought, inadequate air and soil humidity, sudden decreases of night air temperatures, and the appearance of the first frost. Plots facing north tend to produce more mushrooms compared to equivalent plots facing south.|$|E
500|$|Nepenthes rajah has an altitudinal {{distribution}} of 1500–2650m a.s.l. {{and is thus}} considered an (ultra) highland or Upper Montane plant. In the upper limit of its range, night-time temperatures may approach freezing and day-time maxima rarely exceed 25℃. Due to the night-time temperature drop, relative <b>air</b> <b>humidity</b> increases significantly, rising from 65–75% to over 95%. Vegetation at this height is very stunted and slow-growing due to the extreme environmental conditions that prevail. Plants are often subjected to fierce winds and driving rain, as well as exposure to intense direct sunlight. The relatively open vegetation of the upper montane forest also experiences greater fluctuations in temperature and humidity compared with lower altitudes. These changes are largely governed by the extent of cloud cover. In the absence of clouds, temperatures rise rapidly, humidity drops, and light levels may be very high. When cloud cover returns, temperatures and light levels fall, while humidity levels increase. [...] Average annual precipitation in this region is around 3000mm.|$|E

However, of most importance is gas exchange via fine unbranched tubes, the tracheae, which draw oxygen from the surface deep into the various organs, particularly the heart.
