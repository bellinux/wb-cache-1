40|$|Abstract: Two {{different}} synthetic reactions catalyzed by <b>an</b> <b>iridium</b> complex are discussed. The {{first is}} allylic alkylation and allylic am-ination. This reaction proceeds via <b>a</b> -allyl <b>iridium</b> intermediate. The selectivity strongly {{depends on the}} structure of the allylic es-ters. Highly branched product-selective allylic substitution and highly Z-selective allylic substitution were achieved. The selectivi-ties of allylic substitution described here have not been achieved in previous studies with other transition metal complexes. The second reaction is [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition of,-diynes with monoynes. This reaction proceeds via iridacyclopentadiene and tolerates vari-ous functional groups. Functionalized monoynes can be used. These results show that <b>an</b> <b>iridium</b> complex can be a useful catalyst for car...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the N-alkylation of amines with alcohols catalyzed by <b>an</b> <b>iridium</b> complex containing <b>an</b> N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand with a tethered alcohol/alkoxide functionality was investigated {{by a combination of}} experimental and computational methods. The catalyst resting state is <b>an</b> <b>iridium</b> hydride species containing the amine substrate as a ligand, and decoordination of the amine, followed by coordination of the imine intermediate to the iridium center, constitute the rate-determining step (rds) of the catalytic process. The alcohol/alkoxide that is tethered to the NHC participates in every step of the catalytic cycle by accepting or releasing protons and forming hydrogen bonds with the reacting species. Thus, the iridium complex with the alcohol/alkoxide tethered to the N-heterocyclic carbene ligand acts as a bifunctional catalyst...|$|R
