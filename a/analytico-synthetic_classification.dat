50|$|Colon {{classification}} (CC) is {{a system}} of library classification developed by S. R. Ranganathan. It was the first ever faceted (or <b>analytico-synthetic)</b> <b>classification.</b> The first edition was published in 1933. Since then six more editions have been published. It is especially used in libraries in India.|$|E
50|$|S. R. Ranganathan {{conceived}} the five laws of library {{science and the}} development of the first major <b>analytico-synthetic</b> <b>classification</b> system, the colon classification. In India, he is considered to be the father of library science, documentation, and information science and is widely known {{throughout the rest of the}} world for his fundamental thinking in the field.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{issues related}} to the use of faceted classifications in an online environment. The author argues that knowledge organization systems can be fully utilized in information retrieval only if they are exposed and made available for machine processing. The experience with classification automation to date may be used to speed up and ease the conversion of existing faceted schemes or the creation of management tools for new systems. The author suggests {{that it is possible to}} agree on a set of functional requirements for supporting faceted classifications online that are equally relevant for the maintenance of classifications, the creation of classification indexing tools, or the management of classifications in an authority file. It is suggested that a set of requirements for <b>analytico-synthetic</b> <b>classifications</b> may be put forward to improve standards for the use and exchange of knowledge organization systems...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{preprint}} to {{be published}} in the Extensions & Corrections to the UDC. The paper explains the basic functions of browsing and searching that need to be supported in relation to <b>analytico-synthetic</b> <b>classifications</b> such as Universal Decimal Classification (UDC), irrespective of any specific, real-life implementation. UDC {{is an example of a}} semi-faceted system that can be used, for instance, for both post-coordinate searching and hierarchical/facet browsing. The advantages of using a classification for IR, however, depend on the strength of the GUI, which should provide a user-friendly interface to classification browsing and searching. The power of this interface is in supporting visualisation that will 'convert' what is potentially a user-unfriendly indexing language based on symbols, to a subject presentation that is easy to understand, search and navigate. A summary of the basic functions of searching and browsing a classification that may be provided on a user-friendly interface is given and examples of classification browsing interfaces are provided...|$|R
40|$|Examines the {{limitations}} of the dynamic theory of classification in accommodating the changes and rapid growth of new topics in the universe of knowledge. Change in an <b>analytico-synthetic</b> scheme for <b>classification</b> is much more a web of connections and mapping these changes is a complex process. Suggests that there is need for exploration of this complexity for both improving systems, and revisiting our theory...|$|R
5000|$|In 1904, Otlet and La Fontaine {{began to}} publish their {{classification}} scheme, which they termed the Universal Decimal Classification. They worked with numerous subject experts, for example with Herbert Haviland Field at the Concilium Bibliographicum for Zoology, and completed this initial publication in 1907. The system defines not only detailed subject classifications, {{but also an}} algebraic notation for referring to the intersection of several subjects; for example, the notation [...] refers to the statistics of mining and metallurgy in Sweden. The UDC {{is an example of}} an <b>analytico-synthetic</b> <b>classification,</b> i.e., it permits the linking of one concept to another. Although some have described it as faceted, it is not, though there are some faceted elements in it. A truly faceted classification consists solely of simple concepts; there are many compound concepts listed in the UDC. It is still used by many libraries and bibliographic services outside the English-speaking world, and in some non-traditional contexts such as the BBC Archives.|$|E

40|$|Classifications {{can help}} to {{overcome}} difficulties in information retrieval of heterogeneous and multilingual collections for which linguistic and free text searching is not sufficient or applicable. However, there are problems in the machine readability of classification systems which do not facilitate their wider use and full exploitation. The authors focus on issues of automation of <b>analytico-synthetic</b> <b>classification</b> systems such as Universal Decimal Classification (UDC), Bliss Bibliographic Classification (BC 2) and Broad System of Ordering (BSO). 'Analytico-synthetic√¢ means here classification systems that offer the possibility of building compound index/search terms and that lend themselves to post-coordinate searching...|$|E
50|$|UDC is an <b>analytico-synthetic</b> and faceted <b>classification.</b> It allows an {{unlimited}} combination of attributes {{of a subject}} and relationships between subjects to be expressed. UDC codes from different tables can be combined to present various aspects of document content and form, e.g. 94(410)"19"(075) History (main subject) of United Kingdom (place) in 20th century (time), a textbook (document form). Or: 37:2 Relationship between Education and Religion. Complex UDC expressions can be accurately parsed into constituent elements.|$|R
50|$|The Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) is a bibliographic {{and library}} {{classification}} representing the systematic arrangement of all branches of human knowledge organized as a coherent {{system in which}} knowledge fields are related and inter-linked. The UDC is an <b>analytico-synthetic</b> and faceted <b>classification</b> system featuring detailed vocabulary and syntax that enables powerful content indexing and information retrieval in large collections. Since 1991, the UDC has been owned and managed by the UDC Consortium, a non-profit international association of publishers with headquarters in The Hague (Netherlands).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{analyses}} {{the importance}} of data presentation and modelling {{and its role in}} improving the management, use and exchange of analytico-synthetic classifications in automated systems. Inefficiencies, in this respect, hinder the automation of classification systems that offer the possibility of building compound index/search terms. The lack of machine readable data expressing the semantics and structure of a classification vocabulary has negative effects on information management and retrieval, thus restricting the potential of both automated systems and classifications themselves. The authors analysed the data representation structure of three general <b>analytico-synthetic</b> <b>classification</b> systems (BC 2 -Bliss Bibliographic Classification; BSO-Broad System of Ordering; UDC-Universal Decimal Classification) and put forward some core requirements for classification data representation...|$|E
40|$|The {{starting}} point {{of this article is}} to compare the features of faceted classification and ontologies with a re-evaluation of UDC as an <b>analytico-synthetic</b> <b>classification</b> system. We are therefore proposing a theory that was used as the basis of a project in the 80 s but which will imply an advance in the field of information retrieval in the future context of the internet. This theory is based on the post-coordinated use of LCSH and the setting-up of their equivalence with UDC for indexing. The retrieval process is based on the generation of clusters characteristic of data mining and the linking of existing controlled vocabularies and free language in all languages with the corresponding UDC notations. This will be achieved by making UDC compatible with existing classifications, thus profiting from all the knowledge structured so far, thanks to the creation of a suitable format. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{attention}} of the Classification Research Group was first drawn to Ludwig von Bertalanffy‚Äôs General System Theoryl when we were considering the relevance of integrative level theory to the selection of Main Classes in a scheme of classi-fication. 2 The problem, briefly, was this: if, as we agreed, {{the boundaries of the}} old-fashioned disciplines were becoming blurred, could we find a more scientific principle for grouping the terms which formed a schedule of classes? What should be the starting points for facet analysis? Integrative level theory suggcstcd a sequence of entities which had a more or less permanent existence: atoms, molecules, masses, cells, animals, humans. If these were considered as what Ranganathan has called &dquo;Personality&dquo; terms, the enumeration of their properties and attributes, and the operations in which they could take part, would provide the schedules of a general <b>analytico-synthetic</b> <b>classification</b> scheme. The outcome of these discussions can be seen in two Library Association pamphlets and the British National Bibliography‚Äôs PRECIS system of subject indexing. 3 For many years, Bertalanffy has been developing his General System Theory...|$|E
