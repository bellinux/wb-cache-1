To avoid issues of semantics, in this section we must agree that punishment is <b>a</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>imposed</b> by <b>a</b> legal system along with (or because of) a stigma of wrongdoing or lawbreaking. This definition deliberately excludes penalties unrelated to wrongdoing or lawbreaking, even when imposed by a legal system. It also distinguishes or at least restricts this definition from the one used in operant conditioning.|$|R

In the course of the Inquiry, the ALRC examined some 72 federal statutes that impose some form of civil (or administrative) penalty. Many are relatively silent on procedure.

50|$|A co-insurance, which {{typically}} governs non-proportional treaty reinsurance, is an excess {{expressed as a}} proportion of a claim in percentage terms and applied to the entirety of a claim. Co-insurance is <b>a</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>imposed</b> on the insured by the insurance carrier for under reporting/declaring/insuring the value of tangible property or business income. The penalty is based on a percentage stated within the policy and the amount under reported. As an example: a vessel actually valued at $1,000,000 has an 80% co-insurance clause but is insured for only $750,000. Since its insured value is less than 80% of its actual value, when it suffers a loss, the insurance payout will be subject to the under-reporting penalty, the insured will receive 750000/1000000th (75%) of the claim made less the deductible.|$|R

Employers who are obliged to post bonds for their foreign workers are pro-vided with an incentive to ensure that their workers leave {{at the end of their}} contractually speci®ed stay. We consider the consequences of such a bond when foreign workers can leave legal employers for illegal employment. We also investigate the e¨ectiveness of deferred payments to foreign workers as a means of discouraging transition from legal employment to illegal presence. In the ®nal analysis, although the policy intention is a temporary stay, we con-clude that if foreign workers do not wish to return home, there is an almost inevitability to the creation of a population of illegal immigrants (whose presence may be subsequently legalized) ...|$|R

40|$|Though clearly {{distinct}} {{in nature}} and procedure, both Regulatory Agencies and Courts frequently rely on similar instruments to sanc- tion the same or very similar kinds of illegal behavior. In this paper, we develop a theory {{of the use of}} criminal sanctions in addition to regulatory penalties. We show that it is generally more effective to have <b>a</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>imposed</b> by <b>a</b> Regulatory Agency rather than by the Courts. We extend our analysis by considering imprisonment sen- tences, legal error, and collusion between a Regulatory Agency and an offender.

Our analysis is also relevant to the application of a specific legal doctrine, the Double Jeopardy clause. Economics of Law Enforcement, Regulatory Agency, Courts, Double Jeopardy.,...|$|R
