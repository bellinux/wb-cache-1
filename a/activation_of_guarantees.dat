40|$|Liabilities can be {{guaranteed}} {{by a third}} party. Guarantees are arrangements whereby the guarantor commits to pay or assume the liability of another entity (the original debtor) if certain conditions are met (such as inability of the original debtor to pay). Guarantees may include repayments of principal and/or interest payments. A debt guarantee involves three institutional units: original creditor, original debtor, and guarantor. Activation of a debt guarantee creates a new liability and the guarantor now becomes the new debtor. This raises issues on how to treat flows between the original debtor and creditor and between the original debtor and the guarantor (the new debtor). <b>Activation</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantees</b> affects transactions or other economic flows. Usual cases of guarantees in terms of institutional units involved and motivations may be: (1) government providing guarantees for borrowing by public enterprises or private enterprises (for example, to encourage certain types of activities), (2) financial intermediaries providing guarantees as services for payment of a fee, and (3) parents providing guarantees for their subsidiaries (for example, to cut interest costs).

Recently, protein C inhibitor (PCI) {{was identified as}} a potent inhibitor of thrombin bound to TM and it can thereby regulate the balance between TAFI <b>activation,</b> and inhibition <b>of</b> TAFI <b>activation</b> by APC. Both in a purified system and in plasma, <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> TAFI and protein C by [Ia-TM could be inhibited by PCI. Previously we found in plasma that at low concentrations (approximately 1 nM), TM predominantly stimulated the <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> TAFI whereas at higher concentrations of TM (approximately 10 nM) the <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> protein C resulted in inhibition <b>of</b> the <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> TAFI.
