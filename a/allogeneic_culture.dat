Diseases with monoclonal gammopathy and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia were studied. 1) In normal control subjects, the appearance rate of PWM-induced Ig-containing cells and concentrations of synthesized Ig showed no significant difference between autologous and <b>allogeneic</b> <b>culture</b> systems. 2) In patients with multiple myeloma (MM), both the appearance rate of the cells and the concentrations of all classes of Ig were significantly lower than those of normal control. T cells were considered to display a suppressive function in a mixed culture of patient-T and normal-B cells and to exert an effect on the function and differentiation of B cells in this disease. 3) In contrast to MM, T cells in patients with essential benign monoclonal gammopathy (BMG) exhibited a less suppressive function. However, a remarkable suppressive effect was observed in T cells from patients with BMG accompanied with cancer, malignant lymphoma or Sjogren syndrome. These findings may indicate the differences of T and B cell functions among clinical types of BMG. 4) As to polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, there was an increase in concentrations of synthesized Ig in both autologous and <b>allogeneic</b> <b>culture</b> systems in patients with liver cirrhosis, suggesting a hyperfunction of T and B cells. Similar findings were observed in patients with chronic active hepatitis. 5) T cells in patients with RA exhibited suppressor functions on the appearance rate of Ig-containing cells. In patients with SLE in an active stage, T cells showed a helper function on. Ig synthesis, whereas in the inactive stage B cell functions were found to increase. In polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, merely the results of Ig-containing cells and synthesized Ig did not seem relevant directly to the cause of hypergammaglobulinemia. Further studies regarding the relations of these results to surface Ig on B cell and local Ig production in tissue lesions will be required...|$|E

The resulting cytotoxic effector cells were cloned and tested for activity against the stimulating B lymphoblast, K 562 and melanoma targets. Specific clones which killed only the stimulating B lymphoblasts (cytotoxic T lymphocytes; CTL) were re-cloned and the subclones tested for cytolysis of B lymphoblasts and melanoma cells. Of seven primary CTL clones generated in <b>allogeneic</b> <b>culture,</b> 308 subclones developed the ability to kill melanoma cells and none retained specific CTL function. In the autologous system, 180 subclones were derived from three specific primary clones: of these, 13 (7 %) retained specific function, 29 (16 %) were able to kill both B lymphoblasts and melanoma cells, and 93 (52 %) killed only the melanoma target. Testing of random clones demonstrated that whereas both B lymphoblast killing (CTL function) and melanoma cell killing (anomalous killer; AK function) were blocked by a monoclonal antibody to LFA- 1, only CTL function was blocked by anti-T 3 or anti-T 8 antibodies. The factor(s) causing the progression of CTL to AK cells are discussed.

PWM-induced immunoprotein synthesis by human peripheral blood lymphocytes was the model used to study the cellular interactions. PWM was shown to induce helper T cell function which caused non-PWM treated B cells to secrete immunoglobulin. PBL from certain individuals could not be induced by PWM to secrete Ig therefore allogeneic co-cultures of helper T cells and B cells were examined to define the defective cell population. Ig synthesis in <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cultures</b> of T and B cells was always greater than that observed in autologous cultures when cells from responders were assayed. However, when <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cultures</b> were initiated using B cells from a responder and PWM treated T cells from a non-responder and examined for Ig synthesis, the B cell responses were markedly lower than seen in the autologous responder cultures. In addition, PWM activated helper T cells from a responder induced a significantly higher Ig synthesis by B cells from a non-responder. These observations indicate that PBL from individuals who do not respond in a PWM driven Ig synthesis assay have relatively normal B cell function but are deficient in helper T cell function...|$|R

Co-culture of allogeneic cells produces a degree of polyclonal activation of B cells and a much higher level of IgM anti-tetanus antibody than autologous cultures. Depletion of tetanus toxoid or alloantigen-reactive T cells by 3 H-thymidine suicide indicates that in autologous cultures help for anti-tetanus toxoid antibody production is provided by antigen-reactive T cells while in <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cultures</b> antibody production is dependent on the presence of alloreactive T cells.

40|$|In {{studying}} T cell regulation, {{peripheral blood}} mononuclear cells from normal subjects were examined for 'spontaneous', rather than mitogen-induced, suppressor cell activity. Normal blood leucocytes from 30 subjects included a subpopulation of cells capable of suppressing {{the response of}} lymphocytes to the T cell mitogen phytohaemagglutinin by 21 - 35 %. The indicator system for these studies consisted of fresh normal lymphocytes stimulated by three concentrations of PHA in {{the presence or absence of}} normal but mitomycin C treated peripheral blood lymphocytes. To measure accurately the spontaneous suppressor cell activity, additional cultures were needed to control for the suppressive effects of crowding and metabolic competition. Allogeneic, cryopreserved 'B' cell enriched populations, supplied satisfactory control cells for this purpose. While <b>allogeneic</b> <b>culture</b> systems could induce significant suppressor cell activity after 7 days of co-culture, they could not induce this activity in the 3 days required to assay spontaneous suppressor cell effects. In developing this assay we noted that (a) crowding became a factor in the cellular response to mitogens with concentrations higher than 2 X 10 (4) cells/well, (b) spontaneous suppressor cell activity decreased rapidly once cells were placed in culture and (c) both spontaneous and concanavalin A (Con A) activated suppressor cells could significantly reduce the response to PHA even when added to cultures established with mitogens 72 hr earlier. The ability to measure spontaneous suppressor cell activity in vitro will allow more physiological studies of the membrane markers and functional characteristics of these cells than is possible in conventional studies utilizing Con A. In addition, this assay allows the detection of enhanced in vivo activity of suppressor cells not easily detected in assays relying on mitogen induction of suppression. Such increased activity is thought to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of a number of human diseases...|$|E

The response was revealed by plating the cultured cells with both native SRBC and TNP-conjugated pigeon erythrocytes (TNP [...] PRBC). Specific responses were obtained in all the cultures. Bispecific haemolytic plaque-forming cells (PFC) were detected in almost all cultures of individual Swiss mice cells with a frequency of 2 - 5 [...] 14 PFC/ 10 (6) cells recovered. In DBA/ 2 cell cultures bispecific PFC were found in half the cultures (2 - 5 [...] 8 - 3 / 10 (6) cells) and in C 57 Bl cell cultures in 30 per cent of the cultures (7 [...] 21 / 10 (6) cells). When cells from individual Swiss mice immunized in vivo with TNP [...] SRBC were as an <b>allogeneic</b> <b>culture</b> from the 2 nd day after immunization in the presence of TNP [...] SRBC, the frequency of bispecific PFC increased from 8 to 30 / 10 (6) cells. Mixed allogeneic cultures of normal C 57 Bl and DBA/ 2 cells yielded high specific responses with regular occurrence of bispecific PFC only when the numbers of cells cultured together was small. However, when allogeneic cells were mixed 24 hours after starting the cultures, all responses were stimulated and bispecific PFC were found in considerable numbers (4 [...] 33 / 10 (6) cells). Cross-reactivity between TNP [...] PRBC and native SRBC antigens was studied by culturing cells with each of the antigens and plating the cells with both, or by immunizing in vivo with SRBC or PRBC and culturing the cells with both antigens from the 2 nd to the 5 th day after immunization with both antigens.

By contrast, nonrheumatoid fluids induced significant blastogenesis of RA lymphocytes in 2 of 13 experiments, and of non-RA lymphocytes in 1 of 14 experiments. The blastogenicity of fluids was found to correlate significantly with the presence therein of immunofluorescent intracellular inclusions of immunoglobulin and complement.

DCs are crucial regulators of the immune response, capable of inducing immunity as well as tolerance. In our in vitro study we showed a tolerogenic effect of NFA on phenotype and function of LPSmatured monocyte-derived DCs. Different drug concentrations dose-dependently downregulated the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, particularly CD 80 and lowered the expression of dendritic cell marker CD 1 a. Opposingly, the expressions of two inhibitory surface molecules, associated with tolerogenic DCs, immunoglobulin-like transcripts (ILT) 3 and ILT 4 were induced in treated DCs. The levels of TNFá production by NFA-treated DCs did not change significantly compared to controls, whereas the IL- 12 p 70 and IL- 10 production was completely abrogated at higher drug concentrations. However, atlower drug concentrations, the production of IL- 12 p 70 was increased. There {{were no significant differences in}} the uptake of FITC labeled dextran by treated DCs compared to untreated cells. In <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cultures</b> with whole CD 4 + T cells, dendritic cells differentiated in the presence of NFA appeared poor stimulators of CD 4 + T-cell proliferation, even compared to immature DCs (iDCs).

The soluble fgl 2 (sfgl 2) protein generated in a baculovirus expression system bound to both T cells and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC) in a specific manner. sfgl 2 exhibited immunomodulatory properties capable of inhibiting T cell proliferation stimulated by alloantigens, anti-CD 3 /anti-CD 28 mAbs, and Con A in a dose-dependent manner; however, it had no inhibitory effects on CTL activity. The time- and dose-dependent inhibitory effect of sfgl 2 on alloreactive T cell proliferation could be neutralized by a mAb against mouse fgl 2. Polarization toward a Th 2 cytokine profile with decreased production of IL- 2 and IFN-γ and increased production of IL- 4 and IL- 10 was observed in sfgl 2 -treated <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cultures.</b> Exposure of immature DC to sfgl 2 abrogated the expression of CD 80 high and MHC class IIhigh molecules and markedly inhibited NF-κB nuclear translocation, thus inhibiting their maturation. sFgl 2 -treated DC had an impaired ability to stimulate allogeneic T cell proliferation. Maximal inhibition of proliferation was observed when allogeneic T cells were cultured with sfgl 2 -treated DC and sfgl 2 protein was added in the culture. These data provide the first evidence to demonstrate that sfgl 2 exerts immunosuppressive effects on T cell proliferation and DC maturation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2001 by The American Association of ImmunologistsUpon activation, naive T cells {{alter their}} migratory patterns, {{acquiring}} {{the ability to}} move through peripheral tissues as well as the general lymphoid circulation. Although the mechanisms responsible for these alterations are not well understood, changes in chemokine receptor expression may play a critical role. To investigate these changes, the expression patterns of two chemokine receptors, CXCR 3 and CXCR 4, were compared on CD 4 + T cells following activation in the MLR. By day 9 of activation, expression of the inflammatory chemokine receptor CXCR 3 was up-regulated, while expression of the homeostatic chemokine receptor CXCR 4 was down-regulated. Alterations in receptor expression occurred almost exclusively on a subpopulation of T cells that expressed higher levels of CD 4. These CD 4 high T cells demonstrated many characteristics of activated T cells and had undergone division in the MLR. By day 9 of culture, the majority of CXCR 3 + and CXCR 4 - cells had divided and had acquired an activated/memory phenotype (CD 45 RA- CD 45 RO+ CD 69 + CD 25 +). The levels of transcripts for both CXCR 3 and CXCR 4 were increased upon allo-activation. The discrepancy between levels of CXCR 4 mRNA and surface protein was not due to sequestration of the receptor in intracellular compartments, as CXCR 4 was not detectable intracellularly. However, intracellular CXCR 3 was readily detectable. Finally, cells from <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cultures</b> demonstrated enhanced migration toward IFN-inducible T cell chemoattractant and reduced migration toward stromal cell-derived factor- 1 compared with syngeneic controls, thus suggesting that the observed switch in receptor expression may at least partly contribute to the differential patterns of migration displayed by naive and memory T cells.

40|$|The proliferative {{response}} of lymphocytes during <b>allogeneic</b> mixed-lymphocyte <b>cultures</b> is stimulated principally by antigens of a distinct {{region of the}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1 (1 - 4). Reexposure of primed alloimmune lymphocytes to subcellular preparations or liposome-incorporated antigens obtained from the immunizing strain, but not MHC-disparate strains, stimulates an accelerated generation of cytotoxic T. lymphocytes (CTL) (5 - 10). However, primary mixedlymphocyte reponses (MLR) and CTL generation {{have been reported to}} occur only when stimulated by intact metabolically active allogeneic lymphocytes (11, 12). Although,inhibition of DNA-synthetic mechanisms by x-irradiation or mitomycin C does not impair the ability of intact cells to stimulate, exposure to thermal or ultraviolet energy will destroy stimulating ability (13). Hence, the requirements for MLR stimulation have appeared to require a metabolic or cell-surface configurational state not available when membrane fragments or isolated Ia molecules are employed.

Autologous syngeneic PMNs decreased T-cell proliferation induced by <b>allogeneic</b> DCs. <b>Culture</b> supernatant (CS) derived from PMNs also decreased allostimulation ability of immature DCs {{and increased the}} expression of transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1 on DCs. A TGF-β 1 monoclonal antibody, a CD 40 monoclonal antibody, or a serine protease inhibitor reversed the effect of PMN CS on DC allostimulatory ability. Furthermore, elastase reproduced the inhibitory effect of PMN CS on DC allostimulatory ability and the TGF-β 1 production. The role of elastase was confirmed by examining PMN CS from two patients with cyclic neutropenia, a disease due to mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene. These PMN CS samples had reduced elastase activity and were unable to increase DC TGF-β 1 production. Moreover, elastase and PMN CS induced IκBα degradation in DCs.

Cultures of macrophages, T cell-enriched lymphocytes, or macrophages and lymphocytes combined were prepared from the blood of fourteen normal donors and five patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The effects of the mitogens, phytohaemagglutinin and pokeweed, on interferon production and lymphocyte transformation were studied and the following observations made: (a) T-cell effector and proliferative functions were depressed as evidenced by the absence of interferon and proliferative response to PHA and PWM at 3 days in vitro; (b) Three out of five patients showed no interferon or proliferative response at 6 days, thus indicating a B lymphocyte abnormality as well; (c) macrophages from both normal and leukaemic subjects augmented mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte interferon production and lymphocyte transformation. However, the addition of normal <b>allogeneic</b> macrophages to <b>cultures</b> of lymphocytes prepared from the patients did not restore the proliferative and interferon responses to normal levels...|$|R
40|$|Alternatives {{to the use}} of radioisotopes {{to measure}} cell {{proliferation}} in mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) are desirable to avoid the hazards and costs associated with radioisotope use. The versatile fluorochrome 5, 6 -carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) has been used to measure MLR and provides the opportunity to measure several different growth parameters. This study was aimed at determining which growth parameter is most practical and suitable for measuring murine MLR. The parameters measured were: the relative number of daughter T-cells, the relative number and frequency of reactive T-cell precursors and the relative number of mitotic events. Responder cells were CFSE-labeled unfractionated splenocytes from C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Stimulator cells included irradiated splenocytes from C 57 BL/ 6 (control), B 6 D 2 F(1) (haplo-allogeneic) or FVB/N (<b>allogeneic)</b> mice. <b>Cultures</b> were harvested daily for 1 week. Stimulator T-cells rapidly declined to less than 0. 2 - 0. 3 % of the mixed population by day 2 of culture. Experimental groups had a significantly higher number of daughter T-cells and mitotic events after 2 days of culture with the number of daughter T-cells climbing exponentially after 5 days of culture. The number and frequency of reactive T-cell precursors were significantly higher in experimental groups on days 2 - 3, but this difference became insignificant by day 4. Among all the parameters, the relative number of daughter T-cells was the most practical for measuring MLR, after 5 days of culture, based upon the growth kinetics of responder T-cells and the survival of the stimulator cells.

40|$|Parathyroid hypofunction is the {{complication}} {{which is}} occasionally encountered after the surgical treatments of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Allogeneic parathyroid cell transplantation {{is thought to}} be a promising way to treat the hypofunction syndrome of parathyroid gland. In the present study, the evaluation of the allogeneicity of parathyroid gland cells was investigated. To evaluate the allogeneicity of human parathyroid cells, flow cytometry and lymphocyte proliferation test (LPT) were done. Allogeneic human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cultured with PBMC, or parathyroid cells (PTC) isolated from the patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. After 5 days of in vitro <b>culture,</b> <b>allogeneic</b> human PBMC were analyzed by flow cytometry for the phenotypic changes in CD 3 /CD 25 double positive cells, or ^ 3 H-thymi. dine uptake tests were done for LPT. T cells of allogeneic PBMC expressed higher level of CD 25 when stimulated by PBMC rather than by PTC. ^ 3 H-thymidine uptake was greater when stimulated by PBMC rather than by PTC. In conclusion, the allogeneicity of human parathyroid cells was less both in CD 25 expression and LPT than that of PBMC...|$|R
40|$|Reactivity in <b>allogeneic</b> mixed {{leukocyte}} <b>culture</b> (MLC) ~ {{tests is}} usually {{regarded as a}} reflection of differences for the major histocompatibility system (1, 2), although exceptions to this general rule have been reported (3). The MLC response can be interpreted as the recognition (sensitization) phase of the in vivo homograft or graftversus-host reaction (4, 5). Recently Wilson and Nowell (6) have shown that xenogeneic MLC stimulation is weak compared to that in allogeneic mixtures, {{as is the case in}} xenogeneic and allogeneic graft-versus-host responses (7). The lesser graftversus-host responses in xenogeneic combinations could be explained in a number of ways. One possibility is that xenogeneic differences are less well recognized, an interpretation consistent with the above MLC findings. However, since other possible explanations exist, it seemed important to confirm this lower MLC stimulation in xenogeneic combinations in a larger number of species in combinatorial fashion. We have tested the response of cells of three different species (human, mouse, and dog) to stimulation by these same three species plus two more (rabbit and rat). With the first three species we di...|$|R
40|$|Genetically {{resistant}} C 3 H mice {{have been}} made phenotypically susceptible to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) by cortisone (1), cytoxan (2), and eperythrozoon infection (3). There is extensive evidence that cultured macrophages from genetically resistant or susceptible strains of mice reflect the genetic resistance or susceptibility of the host. Yet the effects of cortisone, cytoxan, and epierythrozoon in vitro are minimal or absent. However, experiments reported here have shown that certain substances (lymphokines) in supernatant fluid from <b>allogeneic</b> mixed lymphocyte <b>cultures</b> (MLC) rendered the macrophages of C 3 H mice susceptible to MHV. Fluid derived from congenic MLC did not change the resistance of C 3 H macrophages to the virus. Materials and Methods Mice. Three inbred strains of mice were used: PRI, a genetically susceptible strain (4); C 3 H, a genetically resistant strain (4); and C 3 Hss, a strain that carries a single gene for susceptibility. Both the PRI and C 3 H strains have been maintained in our laboratory through brother-sister mating since 1955 (4). The C 3 Hss was developed in this laboratory by backcrosses with PRI mice...|$|R
40|$|The <b>allogeneic</b> mixed {{lymphocyte}} <b>culture</b> (MLC) ~ {{system has}} been widely used as an in vitro model for analysis of lymphocyte recognition mechanisms and the coupled responses. After recognition of allogeneic B cells and monocytes, lymphocytes undergo several phenotypic and functional changes, i. e., blast transformation and proliferation as well as differentiation to allospecific cytolytic and memory cells (reviewed in reference 1). The cellular locus of these well-recognized consequences of the recognition of allogeneic differences in molecules of the major histocompatibility complex is the T lymphocyte. The effector functions of {{the cells of the}} mononuclear phagocyte series, the monocytes and macrophages induced by the aliogeneic response, have been less well delineated. Newman et al. (2) reported the induction of plasminogen activator in monocytes by cell-free MLC supernatants, and several conflicting results have been published on the generation of molecules able to initiate the coagulation protease cascade, e. g., procoagulant activity (PCA) of the tissue factor type in human allogeneic MLC (3 - 5). The first topic of controversy has been the inducibility of PCA per se i...|$|R
40|$|The proliferative {{response}} of <b>allogeneic</b> lymphocytes <b>cultures</b> together, the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), {{has been widely}} used as an in vitro correlate of the antigen recognition phase of the allograft response. The MLR is most informative when it is unidirectional, so that any proliferative response measured in the mixed culture {{can be attributed to}} the capacity of one cell to respond (the responder cell) and another cell to stimulate a response (the target cell). The reaction is rendered "one-way " by inactivating the target cell with mitomycin C (1, 2) or irradiation (3, 4) such that it should not be able to contribute to the DNA synthesis used to measure the reaction. In inbred species, the mixture of parental and F 1 hybrid cells has been used as a natural one-way reaction, since the F 1 target cell should be genetically incapable of reacting to a cell of parental genotype (5 - 7). In recent studies of the MLR, two puzzling sets of observations have been made: (a) mouse spleen cell populations depleted of thymus-dependent (T) lymphocytes or spleen cell populations obtained from athymic (nu/nu) mice appear to respond quite vigorously to mitomycin C-treated or X-irradiated allogeneic cells (8), and (b) FI hybrid spleen cells appear to respond to similarly inactivated parental target cells (9). The apparent responsiveness of T cell-deficient spleen populations issurprisingbecause there isconsiderable evidence that the ability to respondis dependent on the presenceof T lymphocytes (5 - 7, 10, 11). Similarly, the reported responsiveness of F 1 cells to parental cells runs counter to the conventional view that F 1 cells possess all the major alloantigens of each parent and are therefore genetically incapable of responding to parental strain cells (12, 13). The controversial nature of the above observations prompted a closer examination of the cellular interactions occurring in the one-way MLR...|$|R
