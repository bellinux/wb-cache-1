40|$|Amputation, one of {{the oldest}} types of surgery {{performed}} for therapeutic purposes, has main in-dication, the severe trauma to a limb that is incompatible to preserve because of the irreversible ischemia. The loss of a limb due to trauma has also a devastating emotional impact on a patient, escalating to genuine mental disorders that stretch out further than the loss of the limb itself pro-duces. Thus, there is a certain sequential order regarding risk for developing mental disorders, starting from the immediate reaction, the acute stress disorder, and ending with the post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety that is mostly related to one’s perceived image, which further <b>aggravates</b> their <b>disability.</b> The present paper aims to realize a synthesis of the emotional elements that can intensify up to mental disorders; by understanding the impact of squeal pro-duced by the amputation, we can actually improve the multidisciplinary approach before and after surgery for the patient that suffered an amputation...|$|R
40|$|Developmental {{dyscalculia}} (DD) is {{a number}} processing and calculation disorder that has been identified {{in a similar fashion}} to other specific learning disorders. That is, the diagnosis is made when the individual’s achievement or ability in arithmetic is significantly below that expected for age, schooling, and level of intelligence. This disorder is conceptualized as a hereditary disorder, being present from early childhood, and is not the result of poor or inappropriate schooling, cultural factors or medical conditions (American Psychiatric Association, 2000; WHO, 1996), although these latter conditions can <b>aggravate</b> any learning <b>disability.</b> Although this widely accepted definition appears plausible, findings from recent years require reconsideration firstly of the way DD is defined and secondly of diagnostic criteria...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the central}} role of nonverbal {{behavior}} in regulating social interactions, its relationship to functional disability in schizophrenia has received little empirical attention. This study aimed at assessing the relationship of patients' spontaneous facial expressivity during the clinical interview to clinician-rated and self-reported measures of functional disability. The nonverbal behavior of 28 stabilized patients with schizophrenia was analyzed by using the Ethological Coding System for Interviews (ECSI). Functional disability was assessed using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale and the Sheehan Disability Scale (DISS). Partial correlation analysis controlling for the confounding effects of neuroleptic treatment showed that facial expressivity was correlated with the GAF score (r= 0. 42, P= 0. 03) and the scores on the subscales of the DISS measuring work (r=- 0. 52, P= 0. 005) and social (r=- 0. 50, P= 0. 007) disability. In a multiple regression model, nonverbal behavior explained variation in patients' work and social disability better than negative symptoms. The results of this pilot study suggest that deficits in encoding affiliative signals {{may play a role in}} determining or <b>aggravating</b> functional <b>disability</b> in schizophrenia. One clinical implication of this finding is that remediation training programs designed to improve nonverbal communication could also serve as a useful adjunct for improving work and social functioning in patients with schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND:: Low {{back pain}} (LBP) remains a common health {{problem that is}} {{characterized}} by ambiguity and can progress to chronic disability. In recent years researchers have started to focus on understanding whether and how the attitudes and beliefs {{of the health care}} providers influence the management and the outcome of LBP. OBJECTIVES:: The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize Quebec physiotherapists' (PTs') knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about LBP and their intolerance of uncertainty (IU) to determine whether and how these characteristics predict judgments of assessment and treatment recommendations. METHODS:: A total of 108 PTs from Quebec, Canada completed the Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physiotherapists, the Fear of Pain Questionnaire, and the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale. Participants also read 2 vignettes that described patients with LBP and reported their assessment and treatment recommendations. RESULTS:: Only 13 PTs (12 %) were able to identify clinical practice guidelines for LBP. In addition, PTs did not generally agree with recommendations to return to work or activity. A biomedical orientation was a significant predictor of clinical judgments of spinal pathology and was associated with an increased sense of IU. In contrast, a behavioral approach better predicted treatment recommendations for return-to-work or activity. Finally, the association between IU and treatment decisions was mediated by treatment orientation. DISCUSSION:: Health care practitioners play a significant role in the management of LBP. Research on the process of knowledge translation, clinical decision making, and dealing with uncertainty to avoid <b>aggravating</b> LBP <b>disability</b> is clearly warranted. status: publishe...|$|R

Patients and methods: A total of 120 adult patients diagnosed with migraine at a single tertiary care center were included in this cross-sectional study. Data on sociodemographic and migraine-related characteristics, family history of psychiatric diseases, comorbid psychiatric diseases, and first-episode characteristics were recorded. Mood Disorders Diagnosis and Patient Registration Form (SCIP-TURK), Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ), and Hypomania Checklist- 32 -Revised (HCL- 32 -R) were applied to all patients by experienced clinicians, and clinical diagnoses were confirmed using Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I). Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) was used to evaluate the headache-related disability. Study parameters were compared between migraineurs with and without comorbid BD. Results: The diagnosis of comorbid BD was confirmed in 19. 2 % of migraineurs. A significantly higher percentage of patients with comorbid BD than those without comorbid BD had family history of BD (39. 1 % vs 6. 2 %, P 30 (OR, 3. 69; 95 % CI, 1. 12 – 12. 19; P= 0. 032) were associated with 14. 42 times and 3. 69 times increased likelihood of BD, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings revealed comorbid BD in a remarkable percentage of migraineurs and a higher likelihood of having BD in case of a positive family history of type I BD and MIDAS scores > 30. Comorbid BD was associated with a higher rate for a family history of BD, suicide attempt, and childhood physical abuse as well as <b>aggravated</b> migraine-related <b>disability</b> among migraineurs. Migraineurs with and without comorbid BD showed similar sociodemographic and migraine disease characteristics as well as similar high rates for comorbid anxiety and first-episode depression.

40|$|A {{severe and}} {{challenging}} complication {{in the treatment}} of hemophilia A is the development of inhibiting antibodies (inhibitors) directed towards factor VIII (FVIII). Inhibitors <b>aggravate</b> bleeding complications, <b>disabilities</b> and costs. The etiology of inhibitor development is incompletely understood. In a large cohort study in patients with mild/moderate hemophilia A we evaluated the role of genotype and intensive FVIII exposure in inhibitor development. Longitudinal clinical data from 138 mild/moderate hemophilia A patients were retrospectively collected from 1 January 1980 to 1 January 2008 and analyzed by multivariate analysis using Poisson regression. Genotyping demonstrated the Arg 593 Cys missense mutation in 52 (38 %) patients; the remaining 86 patients had 26 other missense mutations. Sixty-three (46 %) patients received intensive FVIII concentrate administration, 41 of them for surgery. Ten patients (7 %) developed inhibitors, eight of them carrying the Arg 593 Cys mutation. Compared with the other patients, those with the Arg 593 Cys mutation had a 10 -fold increased risk of developing inhibitors (RR 10; 95 % CI, 0. 9 - 119). The other two inhibitor patients had the newly detected mutations Pro 1761 Gln and Glu 2228 Asp. In both these patients and in five patients with genotype Arg 593 Cys, inhibitors developed after intensive peri-operative use of FVIII concentrate (RR 186; 95 % CI, 25 - 1403). In five of the 10 inhibitor patients FVIII was administered by continuous infusion during surgery (RR 13; 95 % CI, 1. 9 - 86).

40|$|IntroductionThe {{physical}} constraints {{are present}} in the daily life. However, they are higher at work, where the employee has to adapt, than extra-professional life. The stress, the depression and the anxiety are often reactions to situations, which the person suffering from lumbago is confronted to. It aggravates his situation. ObjectivesThe main objective of this work is to evaluate stress of the subjects suffering from lumbagos in their professional environment and to study the correlations with the social and professional status which may deteriorate the psychological and functional state. MethodIt is a prospective study about 133 patients with lumbago in Oran hospital. The functional disability occasioned by the lumbago was estimated through the scale “EIFEL” and the stress by the “SIEGRIST”. A standardized index card containing the social and professional data of the studied population. The statistical analysis was made on the software SPSS. ResultsThe study evolved 133 patients, 54 women and 79 men, average age is 41 ± 9. 0. A significant relation between the severity of the fonctionnal disability caused by lumbago and stress was established. The last one is more important in women, nurses p< 0. 05 and depends on the chronicity of lumbago. The factors that <b>aggravate</b> the fonctional <b>disability</b> of lumbago are: handling p< 0. 01, production line work p< 0. 01, nurses and elderly person p< 0. 05. A change in jobs is correlated with the chronicity of symptoms p< 0. 001. The sick leave is effective in 20 % the patients in the last 12  months. The patients, who had got re-educational sessions, suffered less than others p< 0. 05. Discussion and conclusionLow back pain in professional environment constitutes a major handicap. It interacts in a negative way with the social and professional aspects. The stress appears as an aggravating factor or as reaction.

40|$|Anemia of {{moderate}} severity is commonly present in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, but one to which {{little attention has}} been paid and despite its frequency the exact mechanism of its production is uncertain. Anemia in rheumatoid arthritis is refractory to anti-anemic therapy. The presence of anemia may hinder adequate physical or orthopedic treatment and may produce a degree of lassitude that considerably <b>aggravates</b> the joint <b>disability.</b> This anemia, therefore, seemed worthy of study and investigations of three aspects are reported here: 1. Changes in peripheral blood, bone marrow, liver function and gastric acidity. 2. Alternations in iron metabolism. 3. Balneotherapy and anemia in rheumatoid arthritis. I. Peripheral Blood Picture, Liver Function, Serum Protein Fraction and Gastric Acidity. 1. The peripheral blood and bone marrow. The number of erythrocytes is 558 ～ 216 × 10 (4) /c. mm. (average: 402 × 10 (4) /c. mm.), hemoglobin-content: 110 ～ 40 % (average: 78. 6 %), and the color index is about 1. 0. The anemia of rheumatoid arthritis treated is mostly normochromic. The white blood cell count is between 11200 and 3720 /c. mm. (average: 7504 /c. mm.), and the number of leucocytes in 80 % of the cases ranges within the normal limits. Eosinophilia is observed 27 % of the cases. Films of the sternal marrow showed no major abnormality in the eight cases examined. Several minor points, however, deserve mention. The nucleated cell count was diminished in seven cases examined, and the decrease of normoblasts in bone marrow would explain the reduced red cell count in peripheral blood. The myeloid series showed a relative increase. 2. Liver function tests and gastric acidity. To illustrate the possible appearance of liver function disturbances in connection with rheumatoid arthritis, the author has made different liver function tests on patients suffering from this disease. From the results it appears that in protein metabolism tests more than 83 % of the cases gave abnormal albumin/globulin ratios and Takata's and erthrocyte sedimentation reactions. The detoxication capacity determined by hippuric acid synthesis tests had decreased in 25 % of the cases examined. The dye excreting capacity, determined by the bromsulfalein tolerance test, was found to be reduced in 64 % of the cases examined. The urin-urobilinogen test showed positive in 28 % of the cases. In all cases the insulin sensitivity test gave pathological readings. Of 40 cases examined, anacidity of gastric juice was observed in 17 cases, subacidity in other 10 cases and normacidity, hyperacidity in remammg 13 cases. Thus, a decrease in the gastric acidity was found to occur in 67. 5 % of the cases. 3. Serum protein fraction. The total serum protein of 31 cases with rheumatoid arthritis appeared {{to be on the same}} level as in normal material. Serum protein fraction was determined in 19 cases by paperelectrophoresis. In rheumatoid patients, albumin fraction of serum protein decreased and γ-globulin fraction increased in all cases examined, compared with the data of normal subject as a control. Alubumin/globulin ratio of rheumatoid arthritis was below the 5 % rejection limit of normal value...|$|R
