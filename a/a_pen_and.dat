5|$|On the February 24 {{episode of}} Raw, Brock Lesnar and his manager Paul Heyman voiced their {{complaints}} about Lesnar {{not being in}} the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania. Instead, the Authority offered Lesnar a contract to face anyone else at WrestleMania. They were interrupted by a returning Undertaker, who confronted Lesnar. While Lesnar signed the contract for a match at WrestleMania with The Undertaker as his opponent, The Undertaker accepted Lesnar's challenge by stabbing Lesnar with <b>a</b> <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> chokeslamming him through a table. This set up a match where Lesnar would attempt to break the Undertaker's 21–0 undefeated streak at WrestleMania.|$|E
5|$|In Bengal, on {{the night}} of the sixth day after childbirth, a number of items may be placed in the lying-in chamber in {{deference}} to Shashthi, such as an earthen pitcher of water covered with a napkin, offerings of husked rice, cooked rice, bananas and sweets, bangles, and pieces of gold and silver. <b>A</b> <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> paper are also kept in the room, because it is believed that Shashthi (or, according to some traditions, Chitragupta or Brahma) comes into the home after everyone is asleep and writes the child's fortune on the paper with invisible ink. In Bihar, the sixth day ceremony is called Chathi or Chati ("sixth") and Shashthi is known by the epithet Chati Mata ("Mother Chati"). A lump of cow dung dressed in red cloth or paper and covered with vermilion, symbolising the goddess, is kept in the lying-in room. Here, the new-born baby is oiled and dressed in new clothes and rings and then named; a feast follows this ceremony. Childless people may perform a vrata (ritual) in worship of Shashthi, called either Chati Mata or Shashthi Vrata, in an effort to conceive.|$|E

25|$|The Apparition did {{not speak}} until the third appearance, and {{therefore}} its identity {{was a matter of}} considerable speculation. Pious villagers Jeanne-Marie Milhet and Antoinette Peyret, on hearing Soubirous' description of the apparition, thought it was the returning spirit of one of their friends, who had died a few months before. Although not part of Catholic doctrine, the concept of the revenant was deeply rooted in Pyrenean superstition. According to tradition, revenants rarely spoke, but communicated their messages in writing, and so Milhet and Peyret furnished Soubirous with paper, <b>a</b> <b>pen,</b> <b>and</b> an inkpot to take with her, in case the apparition should make use of them.|$|E

25|$|The Countess of Wessex {{has been}} criticised for {{accepting}} {{two sets of}} jewels from the royal family of Bahrain during an official day-long visit to the country in December 2011, as {{she and her husband}} returned to the UK from a trip to Afghanistan. She was given one set by Bahrain’s king and a second set by the country’s prime minister, Sheikh Khalifa ibn Salman Al Khalifa. Her husband, the Earl, received <b>a</b> <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> a watch as well as a silk rug from the Crown Prince of Bahrain, Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, who also gave the countess a silver and pearl cup.

25|$|Circa 1504, Raphael {{executed}} <b>a</b> <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> ink sketch, {{today in}} the Louvre museum, in which the subject is flanked by large columns,. Experts universally agree {{it is based on}} Leonardo’s portrait of Mona Lisa. Other later copies of the Mona Lisa, such as that in the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo, and The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore also display large flanking columns. As a result, it was originally thought that the Mona Lisa in the Louvre had side columns and had been cut. However, as early as 1993, Zöllner observed that the painting surface had never been trimmed. This was confirmed through a series of tests conducted in 2004. In view of this, Vincent Delieuvin, curator of 16th century Italian painting at the Louvre museum states that the sketch and these other copies must have been inspired by another version, while Frank Zöllner states that the sketch brings up the possibility that Leonardo executed another work on the subject of Mona Lisa.|$|E
25|$|Karadžić was {{fortunate}} to be a relative of Jevta Savić Čotrić, the only literate person in the area at the time, who {{taught him how to}} read and write. Karadžić continued his education in the Tronoša Monastery in Loznica. As a boy he learned calligraphy there, using a reed instead of <b>a</b> <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> a solution of gunpowder for ink. In lieu of proper writing paper he was lucky if he could get cartridge wrappings. Throughout the whole region, regular schooling was not widespread at that time and his father at first did not allow him to go to Austria. Since most of the time while in the monastery Karadžić was forced to pasture the livestock instead of studying, his father brought him back home. Meanwhile, the First Serbian Uprising seeking to overthrow the Ottomans began in 1804. After unsuccessful attempts to enroll in the gymnasium at Sremski Karlovci, for which 19-year-old Karadžić was too old, Karadžić left for Petrinja where he spent a few months learning Latin and German. Later on, he left for Belgrade, {{now in the hands of}} the Revolutionary Serbia, in order to meet the highly respected scholar Dositej Obradović, and ask him to support his studies. Unfortunately, Obradović dismissed him. Disappointed, Karadžić left for Jadar and began working as a scribe for Jakov Nenadović. After the founding of the Belgrade Higher School, Karadžić became one of its first students.|$|E

500|$|According to Gamasutra's Matt Barton, {{some have}} argued that these changes put Morrowind closer in spirit to the {{original}} Dungeons & Dragons tabletop game, where players take a more creative role in their play, and where players are left to decide for themselves the [...] "right" [...] action. This is a view paralleled by Rolston, who has stated that [...] "The goal of every [...] game is to create something that resembles <b>a</b> <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> paper RPG on the computer." [...] The sheer number of quest possibilities, combined with what developer Ken Rolston identified as a lack of [...] "narrative urgency", left many critics dissatisfied with the main plot. Ken Rolston later stated that the main quest might have been presented with greater force, {{in the style of the}} game's successor, , without losing the free-form design of the series, but such concerns were not addressed prior to Morrowinds release.|$|E
