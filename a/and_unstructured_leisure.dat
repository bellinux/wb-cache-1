40|$|Discretionary {{time outside}} of school offers a {{distinct}} context that can promote adolescent development; however, potential for growth depends in part on how this time is used. In this study, person-centered analyses were used to examine patterns of breadth of participation in both organized <b>and</b> <b>unstructured</b> <b>leisure</b> activities among rural adolescents (N = 276, 49 % female) across grades 7, 8, and 10. Adjusting for self-selection factors, the study associated these patterns with 10 th grade outcomes. Three profiles of participation emerged: consistently low breadth, consistently average breadth, and consistently high breadth of involvement in both organized <b>and</b> <b>unstructured</b> <b>leisure</b> activities over time. The most popular activity types across profile groups were hanging out with friends, team sports, and outdoor activities. Adolescents involved in a greater breadth of organized activities reported the greatest breadth of involvement in unstructured leisure and the best functioning. Adolescents with low breadth of involvement in both organized <b>and</b> <b>unstructured</b> <b>leisure</b> activities consistently showed poorer outcomes. Adolescents in the high breadth of involvement profile were engaged in all activity types at higher rates than adolescents in the average and low breadth of involvement profiles. We advocate for continued efforts to increase adolescent participation {{in a variety of}} different types of out-of-school activities...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Given {{the aging}} {{population}} and protective effects of {{regular physical activity}} (PA) for disease prevention, {{it is important to}} increase low levels of PA among older adults in our communities. This study explored older adults' perceptions of PA, as experienced within the process of aging. PA was conceptualized as both structured exercise-type behaviors <b>and</b> <b>unstructured</b> lower-level (<b>leisure)</b> activities. Methods: We employed qualitative interview methods using maximum variation sampling to recruit 20 older adults from a range of socio-economic backgrounds and PA levels. Results: We found that active and inactive individuals differed in perceptions of age-related decline and strategies to adjust to aging. Perceptions of inactive older adults were constructed within the discourses of disappointment over not meeting standards imposed by stereotypes of an aging body, whereas active older adults engaged in a more agentic discourse, perceiving PA as a challenge that could be tackled by making flexible adjustments. Conclusions: These findings extend current knowledge by revealing some adaptive and maladaptive perspectives regarding PA in later life, and specific strategies to persevere with PA that may inform PA programs targeting older adults. A number of implications for health behavior and policy are discussed, including the importance of structured physical activities of at least moderate level and supporting older adults' autonomy regarding PA decision making through a combination of intervention components.

40|$|Investigation into {{positive}} {{youth development}} has led researchers {{to focus on}} the context of leisure as one that provides youth with opportunities to develop the skills and competencies desired for successful adulthood. This study surveyed 53 (14 males, 39 females, mean age 14. 6) Western Australian high school students using an adapted version of the Youth Experience Survey (YES) 2. 0. Participants were asked to report their perceived developmental experiences in both structured <b>and</b> <b>unstructured</b> activities across 2 domains: identity work and initiative development. Structured activities were found to offer adolescents more opportunities for the development of initiative than unstructured activities. In addition more adult involvement was found to be associated with higher levels of both identity work and initiative development experiences. No differences were found in developmental experiences between different structured activities. However comparisons among different unstructured activities suggest that some forms of <b>unstructured</b> <b>leisure</b> may be particularly beneficial to youth development. Unstructured activities such as hobbies <b>and</b> <b>unstructured</b> sports offered adolescents more initiative and identity experiences than alternate unstructured activities such as media use and communication activities.

40|$|Little {{research}} has focused on street-involved youths’ social relationships. As some scholars have suggested that leisure is inherently social, my research sought to understand whether participation in structured and/or unstructured leisure activities influence street-involved youths’ social relationships with other street-involved youths as well with members of the mainstream community. Written in the publishable paper format, this thesis is comprised of two papers, both of which utilize Foucauldian theory. In the first paper, I examine the impacts of street-involved youths’ participation in Health Matters, a leisure program for street-involved youths in Ottawa, Canada. In the second paper, I examine street involved youths’ unstructured leisure activities (e. g., leisure in non-programmed settings) and their subsequent social impacts. Based on my findings, I argue that street-involved youths use both structured <b>and</b> <b>unstructured</b> <b>leisure</b> to form crucial social connections to make their lives more bearable...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the validity of}} the reported link between well-being and leisure participation in adolescents. Nine hundred and forty-seven, Year 10 students from 19 schools in Adelaide, South Australia, were recruited. Participants completed a questionnaire concerning participation in social, non-social <b>and</b> <b>unstructured</b> <b>leisure</b> activities as well as measures of personality. As expected, personality variables were better predictors of adolescent well-being than spare-time use, although engagement in less structured leisure activities was associated with poorer psychological well-being and substance use. These findings support previous personality research which suggests that spare-time use may be related to well-being only insofar as individuals who are psychologically healthy tend to be involved in structured leisure activities. The implications of these findings for school policy and future research concerning the links between leisure involvement and psychological well-being are discussed.

Research examining passions in adolescence has been limited, despite a tendency for adolescents to explore their identity by trying new activities (Dworkin et aI., 2003). The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine the association between adolescent passions and positive adjustment (psychological well-being, optimism, purpose in life, and low risktaking), as well as investigate possible underlying mechanisms for the link between passions and adjustment. High school students (N= 2270, 48. 7 % female) from Southern Ontario completed questionnaires in grades 10, 11, and 12. Path analyses were conducted to examine cross-lag paths among all study variables. Passions predicted higher optimism and purpose, as well as lower negative risk-taking, over time, but these adjustment indicators in tum did not predict higher passions over time.

Questionnaires completed by 1280, 12 - to 17 -year-old, Western Australian metropolitan, high-school students were analysed. It was found that perceived parent strictness, connectedness to adolescents, and parenting style were positively associated with adolescent participation in structured leisure activities, but negatively associated with time spent in unstructured activities. Hours of involvement in structured <b>and</b> <b>unstructured</b> <b>leisure</b> activities were negatively associated with perceived susceptibility to peer pressure.

40|$|The {{perception}} of Turkish and Moroccan mothers of their children’s leisure time activitiesToday, {{the importance of}} social participation is reflected in an accessibility discourse that {{is based on the assumption}} that as many social groups as possible should have access to mainstream youth work. The non-participation, or restricted participation, of certain social groups and the role of parents in this, is often viewed as a problem. However, all this is done without sufficient regard to the perspective of parents themselves. This article reports on the findings of a study which examined the {{perception of}} Turkish and Moroccan mothers of their children’s structured <b>and</b> <b>unstructured</b> <b>leisure</b> activities. It will include an examination of the significance of ethnic-religious factors, gender attitudes and living conditions. This interpretative study is based on thirteen qualitative interviews with Turkish and Moroccan mothers living in Lokeren, Sint-Niklaas and Ghent. The findings suggest that the mothers interviewed play an important role in their children’s leisure time activity and consciously reflect on how their children should spend their free time. The study found that the perceptions and actions of mothers are influenced by ethnic-religious factors. The importance of religion was illustrated by the fact that many of the mothers interviewed consider it important that children pray during their spare time. In addition, it was found that the mothers enrolled their children in Islamic and Arabic or Turkish lessons, and we observed that the children follow certain codes with regard to language, clothing, diet and alcohol consumption. Even though most of the mothers expressed a preference for their children to adhere to certain requirements and traditions, the study revealed the spontaneity with which children did so in their spare time, as well as the non-binding nature of these codes. The mothers’ preferences were rooted not only in their creeds, but also in the expectations of the community. Comments by both the Flemish and Turkish or Moroccan community seemed to influence the perceptions and choices of the mothers interviewed in relation to their children’s free time. However, the study also demonstrates that not all mothers seemed to interpret ethnic-religious rules in the same way. One important finding was that ethnicreligious factors also affect the attitude of others and this in turn can have an impact on mothers’ perception of their children’s leisure activities. The mothers referred to racism and discrimination which is, to a certain extent, evident in some youth associations and can cause children to drop out. This study also shows that gender-based attitudes have an impact on the preferences of the mothers interviewed in some respects. It reveals that mothers restrict their children’s interaction with the opposite sex to some extent and activities such as dating and sports can be a source of conflict. In general, however, the mothers allow their sons and daughters to undertake the same activities. Where a distinction is made, this is caused mainly by genuine concern about the well-being of the child. Not only religion, but also troubling current events related to sexual violence, were a reason for this. Finally, this study shows the need to take the broader social context into account in order to understand how parents view their children’s leisure activities. In this study, we describe how the actions and strategies of mothers are influenced by their living conditions. Both the family and socio-economic context shape the parenting practices of the mothers interviewed. Even though the approaches of the parents interviewed are diverse in some respects, the overall objective was to protect children against the negative influence of peers and unknown adults. In addition, these parents have also developed strategies to protect younger children from the dangers of busy streets with a lot of traffic. Fears of unsafe neighborhoods is another reason for mothers to limit the access of their children to some types of leisure activities. The fact that leisure opportunities in the neighborhood are considered costly, also affects how parents perceive their children’s free time. The article ends with several recommendations for those who make youth and social policy. The findings challenge the role of Turkish and Moroccan parents which is widely cited as a cause of their children’s lower rates of participation. The results show that policymakers need to face several challenges when it comes to organizing leisure activities for Turkish and Moroccan children. On the one hand, there are parents who think that greater effort is required to recognize ethnic and religious traditions in the children’s leisure time activities and on the other hand, there are parents who would prefer religion to play a less prominent role in children’s free time. A second challenge is that policymakers need to focus on the gender-specific requirements of parents on the one hand, but they also need to open up a dialogue with parents, because the study shows that parents are willing to abandon gender-specific requirements if they believe this would benefit their children’s integration. Another area of tension was wanting to offer developmental opportunities for children in their free time on the one hand, and searching for a protective environment on the other hand. The importance of a differentiated approach is highlighted by these paradoxes. Better support for leisure time activities among (ethnic minority) young people requires an open dialogue that allows an exploration of the perspectives of parents and children and an examination of how (and which) interventions in free time are considered meaningful. Finally, the study shows that the goal of more suitable leisure activities for children and young people cannot be achieved without structural interventions. Because parental perceptions cannot be separated from the wider social context, policymakers cannot rely solely on individual approaches.  De visie van Turkse en Marokkaanse moeders op de vrijetijdsbesteding van hun kinderenIn dit artikel presenteren we de bevindingen uit een studie naar de visie van Turkse en Marokkaanse moeders met betrekking tot de vrijetijdsbesteding van hun kinderen en wat de betekenis is van etnisch-religieuze factoren, genderopvattingen en de leefomstandigheden hierbij. De studie is gebaseerd op dertien interviews met Turkse en Marokkaanse moeders afkomstig uit drie steden in Vlaanderen, namelijk Lokeren, Sint-Niklaas en Gent. De resultaten tonen aan dat de visie van ouders het resultaat is van een wisselwerking tussen verschillende factoren, waaronder etnisch-religieuze aspecten, genderopvattingen en de leefomstandigheden van ouders. Aan de hand van onze bevindingen reiken we enkele spanningsvelden aan waarover nagedacht kan worden bij het uitbouwen van een (jeugd-) beleid. ...|$|E
