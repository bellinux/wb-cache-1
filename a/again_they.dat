5|$|A second, more {{traditional}} design followed {{for the initial}} batch of five unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6230–6234). <b>Again</b> <b>they</b> were of welded tank construction, but lacked any of the streamlining add-ons. Even without the streamlining Type 'B' tenders were distinguishable from Type 'A' by having a slightly different profile at the front and steps and handrails at the rear.|$|E
5|$|Another {{unsuccessful}} {{assassination attempt}} {{took place on}} 25 October, when Lugovoy and Kovtun flew to London <b>again.</b> <b>They</b> left radioactive traces again in their hotel prior to meeting Litvinenko, but did not administer the poison, perhaps due to security cameras in the meeting room. They again disposed of the poison via their room's toilet, and left London.|$|E

5|$|According to Constantine VII, the Slavs rose {{up again}} in the early 840s, but were {{defeated}} by strategos Theoktistos Bryennios. In the south, the two tribes of the Ezeritai and Melingoi held out longer. They were eventually subdued and forced to pay heavy tribute, but retained their autonomy. These two tribes rose up again a century later, in 921. <b>Again</b> <b>they</b> were quickly subdued, this time by the strategos Krenites Arotras, but managed to remain autonomous and retain their distinct identity until well into Frankish times.|$|E

As Jake is about to return to Paris, he receives a telegram from Brett asking for help; she had gone to Madrid with Romero. He finds her there in a cheap hotel, without money, and without Romero. She announces she has decided to go back to Mike. The novel ends with Jake and Brett in a taxi speaking of the things that might have been.|$|E
5|$|Johnson scored another 14 {{goals for}} Ipswich {{on the way}} to a third-place finish in the league in 1998–99, but <b>again</b> <b>they</b> lost out in the {{play-off}} semi-finals, this time losing to Bolton Wanderers on away goals. However, it was not the same story the following year; after three consecutive play-off semi-final defeats in 1996–97, 1997–98 and 1998–99, Ipswich finally reached the final in 1999–2000 with a 7–5 aggregate win over Bolton, before beating Barnsley 4–2 in the final at Wembley Stadium. After scoring 22 goals in 44 league games in 1999–2000, Johnson was awarded with a new, four-year contract with Ipswich.|$|E

5|$|Now Sunderland {{found out}} {{how hard it is}} to score against this terrific defence of ours. Not for nothing have we scored 18 goals against two (both of them freaks) conceded in five ties all away from home. What can I say to do justice to that {{brilliant}} goalkeeper Gil Merrick, to wonderful young Trevor Smith and to the matchless Jeff Hall and Ken Green? Once <b>again</b> <b>they</b> mixed the old cement and constructed that brilliant wall of a defence. Sunderland would have needed to call in a firm of demolition contractors to destroy it.|$|E
5|$|On 11 January 1941, Joyce {{underwent}} surgery in Zurich for a perforated ulcer. He {{fell into a}} coma the following day. He awoke at 2a.m. on 13 January 1941, and asked a nurse to call his wife and son, before losing consciousness <b>again.</b> <b>They</b> were still en route when he died 15minutes later, {{less than a month}} short of his 59th birthday.|$|E
5|$|On 30 April {{the second}} raid across the Jordan began, their {{objective}} to capture Es Salt. This time {{a much larger}} force was involved under command of the Desert Mounted Corps.

Once <b>again</b> <b>they</b> advanced through Turkish artillery fire, and confronted by Turkish strong points in the foothills, were unable to make any progress. That night they moved back across the Jordan, having suffered three dead and eleven wounded.|$|E

They awoke {{on the morning of}} 27 November to find another glacier (later known as the Ninnis Glacier) far larger than the first. As with the first glacier, they had to unhitch the dogs from the sledges and slowly make the treacherous descent. Once {{at the bottom of the}} glacier they spent four days {{crossing}} fields of crevasses, battling strong winds and poor light that made navigation difficult.|$|E
5|$|On {{their boat}} ride to freedom, Cassy and Emmeline meet George Harris's sister and {{accompany}} her to Canada. Cassy discovers that Eliza is her long-lost daughter who was {{sold as a}} child.

George Shelby returns to the Kentucky farm and frees all his slaves. George tells them to remember Tom's sacrifice and {{his belief in the}} true meaning of Christianity.|$|E

The agents later investigate a case involving alien biology being injected into teenagers in Wisconsin, and once <b>again</b> <b>they</b> encounter Deep Throat's killer, who is killed by the local sheriff.|$|E

5|$|Six {{years passed}} before the couple {{returned}} to screen writing, {{this time for}} the romantic comedy Murphy's Romance, based on a novel by Max Schott. Once <b>again</b> <b>they</b> worked with director Martin Ritt, their seventh project together, and Sally Field, who had played the titular lead role in Norma Rae. Despite Murphy's Romance being well-received (it was nominated for two Academy Awards) {{it would be another}} five years before Frank and Ravetch wrote another screenplay; hired by Martin Ritt, the couple wrote the screenplay for Stanley & Iris, loosely based on the novel Union Street.|$|E
5|$|The ANC {{threatened}} to withdraw support for South Africa's next test match against Australia, {{which could have}} led to the cancellation the match due to safety concerns and Australia stated they would not play if the match didn't have ANC support. However, the future South African sports minister Steve Tshwete asked for the ANC to give the supporters another chance and the ANC did not withdraw their support. Instead they issued a warning that if it happened <b>again</b> <b>they</b> would oppose all future tours and the 1995 Rugby World Cup.|$|E

5|$|Three days later, Smith met Rosemary Corcoran, a 25-year-old {{mother of}} three from Castle Vale at the same public house, and <b>again</b> <b>they</b> were seen leaving together. He drove her to Worcestershire before bludgeoning her to death and running over her body near Droitwich Spa. She was found at 8:30am on 12 November by a man walking his dog in a lane near Junction 5 of the M5 motorway.|$|E
5|$|A {{long period}} of waiting and {{training}} followed. Throughout 1943–1944, the division was re-organised under the jungle divisional establishment. This saw {{a reduction in the}} division's artillery, vehicles, equipment and manning, with divisional strength falling from around 18,000 men to about 16,000. The division also lost many of its experienced personnel during this time as they were promoted and moved on to other formations; although it also received reinforcements from the disbanded 30th Brigade. The division's next deployment would not come until November 1944 when they were committed to the Aitape–Wewak campaign. Once <b>again</b> <b>they</b> would be unified as a full division, with several units that had previously been detached, including the 2/3rd Field Regiment and the 19th Brigade, rejoining the division.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of leave, the {{battalion}} began to reform on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland during February 1944 {{and for the next}} eight months they undertook a number of exercises and training periods as they prepared for the next stage of the war. During this time, the battalion's authorised strength was reduced to 803 men of all ranks, as the 3rd Division was converted to the Jungle divisional establishment. On 20 July 1944, the 61st Battalion embarked upon HMAT Katoomba in Cairns and proceeded overseas <b>again.</b> <b>They</b> arrived at Madang in New Guinea four days later. As it was considered that there were still isolated pockets of Japanese in the area, the battalion began patrolling operations almost as soon as they had landed.|$|E
