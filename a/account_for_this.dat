5|$|In 1844, Breckinridge's wife Ann died. Lingering {{sadness and}} {{memories}} of his and Ann's life in Baltimore may have led {{him to leave the}} city and the pastorate he had held for twelve years. He was offered pastorate of the Second Presbyterian Church of Lexington, Kentucky, but instead, accepted the presidency of Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1845 against the advice of his brothers John and William. A rift between Breckinridge and his brother Cabell's widow and other relatives may help <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> surprising decision. He did not feel he could yet return to his home state.|$|E

5|$|Until {{late in the}} 20th century, the {{temperature}} of Eta Carinae {{was assumed to be}} over 30,000K {{because of the presence of}} high excitation spectral lines, but other aspects of the spectrum suggested much lower temperatures and complex models were created to <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>this.</b> It is now known that the Eta Carinae system consists of at least two stars, both with strong stellar winds and a shocked colliding wind (wind-wind collision or WWC) zone, embedded within a dusty nebula that reprocesses 90% of the electromagnetic radiation into the mid and far infrared. All of these features have different temperatures.|$|E
5|$|About half {{of those}} {{who lost their lives}} on the Wall were killed in the first five years after it was {{originally}} installed. Death rates fell from then on, and took a particularly dramatic downturn after 1976. Nearly 86% of the Wall's victims, 120 people, died between 1961 and 1975; between 1976 and 1989 only 19 died. Several factors <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reduction. The Wall became even more impregnable owing to technical improvements carried out in the mid-1970s and more restrictions were put on the area adjoining the Wall, making it more difficult to reach in the first place. The signing of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 led to new opportunities to cross the border legally, resulting in a rise in emigration applications and a corresponding fall in escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|Most {{commonly}} known from western North America, the species was reported growing on sandy soil in Natal Dunes State Park {{in the northeastern}} Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte in 2008. The fruit bodies {{were associated with the}} roots of the native tree species Eugenia brasiliensis. Several hypotheses have been proposed to <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> disjunct distribution: the species may have been present before the Americas separated; it may have been introduced to Brazil by human activity, and subsequently adapted to the environment there; or the North and South American populations may represent a cryptic species complex—appearing morphologically similar but genetically distinct. The Brazilian population has not been compared genetically with North American specimens.|$|E

5|$|Engine number 4 {{suffered}} only minor, external damage. It was dismantled by {{the investigation}} team {{in an attempt}} to determine why it might have been shut down by the crew. A substantial amount of corrosion product was found in the passages of the fuel flow meter on engine number 4. Western Australia's Deputy Mineralogist identified the corrosion product as magnesium hydroxide. This is a corrosion product formed by reaction of magnesium and water, suggesting the fuel passages had been filled with water in the months between the crash and the detailed examination of the engine. Charles Gibbs, an engine specialist employed by the Department of Civil Aviation, estimated at least 45 cubic centimetres of water must have been involved. Rain falling on the crash site before engine number 4 was removed could not <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> much water in the fuel passages. Gibbs first examined the fuel system of engine number 4 and discovered the corrosion about two months after the accident. He conducted a test on an identical flow meter and found that after he left water in the fuel flow passages for approximately 8 weeks a similar amount of corrosion product developed. This suggested the rough running heard by witnesses on the ground may have been caused by water in the fuel reaching engine number 4. The steel rotor in the fuel pump of engine number 1 was slightly corroded but the fuel systems of engines 2 and 3 showed no evidence of corrosion. Investigators formed the opinion that the rough running heard by witnesses on the ground, and the crew's decision to shut down engine number 4 and feather its propeller, may have been related to water in the fuel reaching that engine. Similarly, the intermittent loss of power on all engines in the final minutes of the flight may indicate that all engines were receiving fuel contaminated with water.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{the main}} {{drawback}} {{of the theory}} {{turned out to be the}} result that particles are not self-interacting.
