Airborne dust contaminated with radioactive particles was released from the reactors into the air. This dust was found in Japanese car filters: they contained cesium-134 and cesium-137, and cobalt at levels as high as 3 nCi total activity per sample. Materials collected during April 2011 from Japan also contained iodine-131. Soil and settled dust were collected from outdoors and inside homes, and also from used children's shoes. High levels of cesium were found on the shoelaces.

40|$|Commuting by bike {{has a clear}} health {{enhancing}} effect. Moreover, {{regular exercise}} is known to improve brain plasticity, which results in enhanced cognition and memory performance. Animal research has clearly shown that exercise upregulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF - a neurotrophine) enhancing brain plasticity. Studies in humans found an increase in serum BDNF concentration {{in response to an}} acute exercise bout. Recently, more evidence is emerging suggesting that exposure to air pollution (such as particulate matter (PM)) is higher in commuter cyclists compared to car drivers. Furthermore, exposure to PM is linked to negative neurological effects, such as neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. We carried-out a cross-over experiment to examine the acute effect of exercise on serum BDNF, and the potential effect-modification by exposure to traffic-related air pollution. Thirty eight physically fit, non-asthmatic volunteers (mean age: 43, 26 % women) performed two cycling trials, one near a major traffic road (Antwerp Ring, R 1, up to 260, 000 vehicles per day) and one in an <b>air-filtered</b> room. The <b>air-filtered</b> room was created by reducing fine particles as well as ultrafine particles (UFP). PM 10, PM 2. 5 and UFP were measured. The duration (∼ 20 min) and intensity of cycling were kept the same for each volunteer for both cycling trials. Serum BDNF concentrations were measured before and 30 min after each cycling trial. Average concentrations of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 were 64. 9 μg/m(3) and 24. 6 μg/m(3) in cycling near a major ring way, in contrast to 7. 7 μg/m(3) and 2. 0 μg/m(3) in the <b>air-filtered</b> room. Average concentrations of UFP were 28, 180 particles/cm(3) along the road in contrast to 496 particles/cm(3) in the <b>air-filtered</b> room. As expected, exercise significantly increased serum BDNF concentration after cycling in the <b>air-filtered</b> room (+ 14. 4 %; p= 0. 02). In contrast, serum BDNF concentrations did not increase after cycling near the major traffic route (+ 0. 5 %; p= 0. 42). Although active commuting is considered to be beneficial for health, this health enhancing effect could be negatively influenced by exercising in an environment with high concentrations of PM. Whether this effect is also present with chronic exercise and chronic exposure must be further elucidated. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Background/Objectives: The {{commercial}} hollow {{air filters}} mostly used in automobiles are {{made out of}} cotton gauge, paper, fibrous materials, foam, etc. These filter’s initial cost is low but maintenance cost of these {{is much higher than}} their initial cost with lower life span. The aim of this research work is design and simulation of a hollow cylindrical air filter fabricated using a ceramic material such as Silicon Carbide. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Research on air filters have focused on four main criteria, viz. less pressure drop, high air flow, superior dirt protection and less overall cost. Hence the major parameters were designed based on these factors and also by using Ergun’s equation by considering the air filter as a packed column/bed. The important design parameters considered are particle size and pore size of the ceramic powder in order to have control over porosity. The filter model is designed using CATIA V 5 R 16 and simulated using ANSYS FLUENT software. Findings: Ceramic <b>air-filters</b> can replace the existing <b>air-filters</b> with even better pressure drop. The thickens of these filters are in the range of 5 mm to 10 mm which will result in huge savings compared to the existing vary large filters in terms of space required. A stack of this hollow air filters can also be effectively used for superior dirt protection. However using these filters with thickness more than 20 mm will have higher pressure drop and hence it is not recommended to go beyond this thickness. As the filters are made out of ceramics the life span of the filter will be very high. Damage of the filter due to either the harder and sharp particles or due to cleaning process is avoided. Application/ Improvements: The proposed ceramic air filters can be used in automobiles particularly in heavy vehicles which work in harsh and dusty environment such as quarries, cement and process industries. The improvements achieved as compared to current <b>air-filters</b> are the increase in life of the filters and efficiency of the engine...|$|R

As long as all air intake parts inside the engine bay are sealed, it will work successfully. Although most external system wiring on modern vehicles is quite well sealed, it is usually wise to use additional sealing on computers, fuse boxes, etc., and interior electronics such as radios and entertainment systems (not to mention digital dashboards) are generally not waterproofed and will be ruined by water entering the vehicle. It is also important to install extended ventilation lines to the axles and transfer case; these typically are no more than a foot or so long, and will allow water to contaminate the lubricants. Even with extended vent lines, water can frequently leak past the oil seals; thus it is generally wise to check the axle and transfer case lubricants and change if necessary after deep water crossings.|$|E
40|$|Air {{ionization}} is an {{air cleaning}} technology used to additionally clean air from particles and gases {{in order to}} achieve good indoor air quality. The technology mimics nature´s own ability to purify air of particles, microorganisms, organics and odors. The report includes an experimental study of air ionization as air cleaning in ventilation plants. The experimental study is made in a laboratory with two experimental arrangements with the purpose of studying the removal efficiency of particles, gases and odors when using point ionization (spetsjonisering) and an ionization tube. Since humans spend most of their lives indoors, it is an important factor that particles, gases and odors are removed so that good indoor air quality can be achieved. The study is made in a filter rig and in a constructed chamber. The filter rig studies are made to see the effect of point ionization and its efficiency to increase the separation degree of air-filters. Trials in the filter rig are made with different settings to study what gives the point ionization its best effect. Best effect is achieved with long distance between the point ionization and the <b>air-filter,</b> low flow and with re-circulated air. Experiments are also made with two different materials of <b>air-filter</b> where the results show that a synthetic filter gives the point ionization better condition than with glass fibre filters. Overall, the experimental study of the <b>air-filter</b> rig shows no clear effect of point ionization. Experiments conducted in the chamber with 100 % re-circulated air show however on a marked improvement of the separation degree of <b>air-filter</b> when point ionization gets turned on. The experiment with point ionization shows that measurements made with a Dust Trak (particles ≤ 2. 5 μm) gives the highest efficiency. The decay speed of particles in size of 0. 3 - 0. 5 μm reduces when using ionization tube in the chamber compared to when only using <b>air-filter</b> and point ionization. The experimental study in the filter rig with point ionization does not show big improvement compared with the study made in the chamber. This could be {{due to the fact that}} the point ionization´s aggregate supplies the point tassels with too little voltage in relations to the flows used in the filter rig.

40|$|The present paper reports 1 D and 3 D CFD {{analyses}} of the <b>air-filter</b> box of a turbocharged VVA engine, aiming to predict and improve the gas-dynamic noise emissions through a partial re-design of the device. First of all, the gas-dynamic noise at the intake mouth is measured during a dedicated experimental campaign. The developed 1 D and 3 D models are then validated at full load operation, based on experimental data. In particular, 1 D model provides a preliminary evaluation of the radiated noise and simultaneously gives reliable boundary conditions for the unsteady 3 D CFD simulations. The latter indeed allow to better {{take into account the}} geometrical details of the <b>air-filter</b> and guarantee a more accurate gas-dynamic noise prediction. 3 D CFD analyses put in evidence that sound emission mainly occur within a frequency range of 350 to 450 Hz. Starting from the above result, the original air-box design is modified through the installation of a single Helmholtz resonator, taking into account layout constraints and the influence on engine performance, as well. First, the isolated air-box is studied through a 3 D FEM approach to compute the Transmission Loss (TL) parameter both for the original and the modified design. This analysis is employed to verify the noise abatement in the frequency range of interest, for a zero-mean flow. Then, the new intake system configuration is investigated under actual engine operation, through unsteady 3 D CFD simulations. The resulting reduction in the gas-dynamic noise is verified both in terms of overall radiated SPL and frequency spectrum at full and part load operating conditions, as well. The proposed integrated 1 D- 3 D approach demonstrated to be a useful tool for the design and the analysis of new geometrical intake system configurations, aiming to improve the engine acoustic performance without significant penalties on the delivered power and fuel consumption...|$|E
