Mycoplasma-like bodies were abundant in the phloem sieve tubes of untreated aster, and in aster which redeveloped symptoms after the antibiotic treatment had been discontinued. In contrast, Mycoplasma. like bodies could not be detected by thin. section electron microscopy in symptomless shoots of Achromycin-treated plants immediately {{after a period of}} treatment. In concomitant leafhopper transmission tests with the vector Orosius argentatus, the little leaf agent was not recovered from the symptomless treated shoots, but was readily recovered from diseased shoots which developed after termina-tion of the Achromycin treatment. Symptomless shoots were detached from tomato plants after a period of tetracycline treatment and were either grafted to Datura 8 tramonium indicator plants or established as rooted cuttings. Little leaf symptoms appeared in both groups of plants, showing that the originally symptomless tomato shoots wereinfected with the little leaf agent.

The cell lines were isolated from two extrahepatic bile duct cancers (one adenocarcinoma of common bile duct, one hilar bile duct cancer), two adenocarcinomas of ampulla of Vater, one intrahepatic bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma), and one adenocarcinoma of the gall bladder. The cell phenotypes, including the histopathology of the primary tumours and in vitro growth characteristics, were determined. We also performed molecular characterisation, including DNA fingerprinting analysis and abnormalities of K-ras, p 15, p 16, p 53, hMLH 1, hMSH 2, DPC 4, β-catenin, E-cadherin, hOGG 1, STK 11, and TGF-βRII genes by PCR–SSCP and sequencing analysis. In addition, we compared the genetic alterations in tumour cell lines and their corresponding tumour tissues. All lines grew as adherent cells. Population doubling times varied from 48 – 72 [*]h.

Very few isolates <b>of</b> <b>Mycoplasma</b> pneumoniae had ever been examined for sialidase activity, so it was unknown whether sialidase may contribute to diseases involving this species.

Conclusions The annotated genome of strain M 129 (GenBank NC_ 000912, ATCC 29342), also isolated from a patient with pneumonia, accurately represents the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> sialidase genes from strains of M. pneumoniae typically associated with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia.

40|$|We {{have shown}} that mycoplasmas bind spontaneously to neutrophils, as well as {{directly}} activating the first component of complement with probable subsequent binding through neutrophil complement receptors.

40|$|Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae mhp 379 is a {{putative}} lipoprotein that shares significant {{amino acid}} sequence similarity with a family of bacterial thermostable nucleases. To examine the nuclease activity of mhp 379, the gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli following the deletion of the amino-terminal signal sequence and prokaryotic lipoprotein cleavage site and mutagenesis <b>of</b> the <b>mycoplasma</b> TGA tryptophan codons to TGG. The recombinant fusion protein yielded a 33 -kDa thrombin cleavage product, corresponding in size to the mature mhp 379 protein. Exonuclease activity was indicated by agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of the reaction products that were released when different nucleic acid substrates were used. Endonuclease activity was also indicated by the digestion of closed circular plasmid DNA. The recombinant mhp 379 fusion protein completely digested single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and RNA. The optimal reaction conditions were determined with a novel nuclease assay based on the enhancement of fluorescence of SYBR green I bound to dsDNA. Optimal activity was observed {{in the presence of}} calcium ions at a concentration of 15 mM and a pH of 9. 5. No nuclease activity was observed in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> calcium ions. <b>Mycoplasmas</b> do not have the ability to synthesize nucleic acid precursors, and thus, nucleases are likely to be important in the acquisition of precursors for the synthesis of nucleic acids. Homologs of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system were identified immediately downstream of the gene encoding mhp 379, and two homologs of M. pneumoniae lipoprotein multigene family 2 were also identified immediately upstream.

40|$|AbstractWe used {{confluent}} {{cultures of}} dog gallbladder epithelial cells, stimulated by conditioned medium from {{a culture of}} human neonatal foreskin fibroblasts, to establish the presence of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS, EC 1. 14. 13. 39). Assay was by conversion of radiolabeled arginine to citrulline. By 4 days after addition of the conditioned medium, a relatively high level of activity was observed. However, further study showed that the enzyme did not require addition of the usual cofactors for maximal activity (NADPH, FAD, FMN and tetrahydrobiopterin) and was stable in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> anti-proteolytic agents. Our suspicion that this enzyme might not be NOS but arginine deiminase (EC 3. 5. 3. 6) was confirmed by enzyme purification and by the liberation of ammonia during enzyme reaction.

40|$|The fluorescent-antibody {{method has}} been {{employed}} for the rapid identification <b>of</b> <b>Mycoplasma</b> colonies growing on agar plates. The method {{was found to}} be effective for detection <b>of</b> mixtures <b>of</b> <b>Mycoplasma</b> serotypes growing on primary isolation plates. The technique also helped to define the presence <b>of</b> <b>mycoplasmas</b> which did not produce typical colonies. It was also possible to identify Mycoplasma colonies overgrown by bacterial or fungal contaminants. Conjugates directed against 10 distinct Mycoplasma serotypes have been successfully employed in this system. One of the serotypes is a human oral isolate which has not been previously characterized...|$|R
40|$|We used {{confluent}} {{cultures of}} dog gallbladder epithelial cells, stimulated by conditioned medium from {{a culture of}} human neonatal foreskin fibroblasts, to establish the presence of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS, EC 1. 14. 13. 39). Assay was by conversion of radiolabeled arginine to citrulline. By 4 days after addition of the conditioned medium, a relatively high level of activity was observed. However, further study showed that the enzyme did not require addition of the usual cofactors for maximal activity (NADPH, FAD, FMN and tetrahydrobiopterin) and was stable in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> anti-proteolytic agents. Our suspicion that this enzyme might not be NOS but arginine deiminase (EC 3. 5. 3. 6) was confirmed by enzyme purification and by the liberation of ammonia during enzyme reaction. This enzyme, which is absent from primates and virtually confined to single-cell organisms, suggested the presence <b>of</b> <b>Mycoplasma,</b> a common contaminant of cell cultures, and it was subsequently confirmed that the fibroblast culture was a source <b>of</b> <b>Mycoplasma.</b> With the widespread interest in nitric oxide and NOS, and common use of the convenient [3 H]arginine assay, there is a considerable danger of the two enzymes being confused. At the very least, {{it is necessary to}} check for activity in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> added cofactors. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|NYC medium, {{primarily}} designed for isolation of pathogenic Neisseria, also readily supports the growth <b>of</b> large-colony <b>mycoplasmas</b> and T-mycoplasmas. When compared with A- 3 agar medium and PPLO agar in clinical field trials, NYC medium performed equally {{as well as}} these mycoplasma-specific media in providing recovery <b>of</b> <b>Mycoplasma</b> species from female genital specimens. The transparent, highly-selective NYC medium permits direct, microscopic observation and presumptive identification <b>of</b> <b>mycoplasmas,</b> as well as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, without interference from contaminating saprophytes. As a single medium it can therefore be doubly useful in the diagnosis of gonorrhea and in the recognition of active or asymptomatic mycoplasma infections. Used in gonorrhea screening programs, the medium can be valuable in establishing the frequency <b>of</b> association <b>of</b> <b>mycoplasmas</b> with urogenital tract infection...|$|R
