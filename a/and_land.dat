40|$|The {{take-off}} <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) {{is often}} the most critical and accident prone portion of its mission. This potential hazard coupled with the time and resources necessary to train a remote UAV pilot makes it desirable to have autonomous take-off <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> capabilities for UAVs. However, a robust, reliable, and accurate autonomous takeoff <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> capability for fixed-wing aircraft is not an available feature in many low-cost UAV flight control systems. This thesis describes the design of an autonomous take-off <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> algorithm implemented on an existing low-cost flight control system for a small fixed wing UAV. This thesis also describes the autonomous takeoff <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> algorithm development <b>and</b> gives validation results from {{hardware in the loop}} simulation...|$|R
