He was known to have been {{preparing}} to publish book by a Chinese writer residing in the US about Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping, entitled Godfather of China, Xi Jinping (中國教父習近平). Yiu was arrested by police in Shenzhen on charges of falsely labelling and smuggling industrial chemicals worth $220,000 in 2010 and was sentenced to prison for 10 years allegedly for smuggling, even though the real reason for the trumped up charges, in the eyes of many, was China's increasing restrictions on political expression under Xi. Two Hong Kong magazine publishers, Wong Kin-man <b>and</b> <b>Wo</b> Chung-hau, were arrested and tried in November 2015 for running an illegal business in China after sending copies of a political magazine to people on the mainland.|$|E

25|$|In the Colonial Hong Kong era {{around the}} 1850s, {{agriculture}} in Hong Kong consisted mostly of revenue farms {{that focused on}} opium productions. The industry led to many wealthy Chinese businessmen, who established themselves as the middlemen merchants with international connection. Some of the successful farmers included Yan Wo Hong <b>and</b> <b>Wo</b> Hang Hong from 1858 to 1887. The system was discontinued by colonial authorities, when the economy needed to diversify in other activities. The last opium farm ended in 1913. One of the farms founded in the era was Hong Kong Dairy Farm in 1886. As Hong Kong government favour the transition into a secondary sector, and eventually a tertiary sector, agriculture became a reduced segment.|$|E

2500|$|Although the etymological {{origins of}} [...] "Wa" [...] remain uncertain, Chinese {{historical}} texts recorded an ancient people {{residing in the}} Japanese archipelago (perhaps Kyūshū), named something like *ʼWâ or *ʼWər 倭. Carr (1992:9–10) surveys prevalent proposals for Wa's etymology ranging from feasible (transcribing Japanese first-person pronouns waga 我が [...] "my; our" [...] and ware 我 [...] "I; oneself; thou") to shameful (writing Japanese Wa as 倭 implying [...] "dwarf"), and summarizes interpretations for *ʼWâ [...] "Japanese" [...] into variations on two etymologies: [...] "behaviorally 'submissive' or physically 'short'." [...] The first [...] "submissive; obedient" [...] explanation began with the (121 CE) Shuowen Jiezi dictionary. It defines 倭 as shùnmào 順皃 [...] "obedient/submissive/docile appearance", graphically explains the [...] "person; human" [...] radical 亻 with a wěi 委 [...] "bent" [...] phonetic, and quotes the above Shijing poem. [...] "Conceivably, when Chinese first met Japanese," [...] Carr (1992:9) suggests [...] "they transcribed Wa as *ʼWâ 'bent back' signifying 'compliant' bowing/obeisance. Bowing is noted in early historical references to Japan." [...] Examples include [...] "Respect is shown by squatting" [...] (Hou Han Shu, tr. Tsunoda 1951:2), and [...] "they either squat or kneel, with {{both hands on the}} ground. This is the way they show respect." [...] (Wei Zhi, tr. Tsunoda 1951:13). Koji Nakayama interprets wēi 逶 [...] "winding" [...] as [...] "very far away" [...] and euphemistically translates Wō 倭 as [...] "separated from the continent." [...] The second etymology of wō 倭 meaning [...] "dwarf, pygmy" [...] has possible cognates in ǎi 矮 [...] "low, short (of stature)", wō 踒 [...] "strain; sprain; bent legs", <b>and</b> <b>wò</b> 臥 [...] "lie down; crouch; sit (animals and birds)". Early Chinese dynastic histories refer to a Zhūrúguó 侏儒國 [...] "pygmy/dwarf country" [...] located south of Japan, associated with possibly Okinawa Island or the Ryukyu Islands. Carr cites the historical precedence of construing Wa as [...] "submissive people" [...] and the [...] "Country of Dwarfs" [...] legend as evidence that the [...] "little people" [...] etymology was a secondary development.|$|E
