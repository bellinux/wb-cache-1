Boelcke <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> one Englishman evenly between us, when another opponent, hunted by our friend Richthofen, cut directly in our path.

500|$|Barbara Steele as Elizabeth. [...] This was Steele's {{first film}} since her {{break-through}} horror performance in Mario Bava's Black Sunday (1960). [...] The actress recalled {{that she was}} [...] "in awe" [...] of Price during the production and described the filming of their final scene together as surprisingly physical: [...] "Our major confrontation where he strangles me was done in one take…He really went at me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> bruises on my throat to prove it. [...] Afterward, he was so concerned he had hurt me—a perfect gentleman—a truly kind figure {{in spite of his}} image." [...] While watching the daily rushes of the movie, Corman became convinced that Steele's [...] "thick working class English accent" [...] was not blending well with the other cast members, so after the filming was completed he had all of her dialogue dubbed by a different actress.|$|E

The first round match of the championships against Victoria Country saw him take a pack mark with seconds left in the game and kick the winning goal, his fourth of the match; his resolve led to one recruiter stating [...] "If the draft was on tomorrow <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> first pick, I'd be choosing him... without hesitation. He's just a natural player, he's an athlete and he's a very strong competitor."

500|$|Feller {{was born}} and raised with his sister, Marguerite, in Van Meter, Iowa. His father, William, ran the [...] family farm, and his mother, Lena (Forret), was a teacher and {{registered}} nurse. Feller played catch daily with his father. He had learned to throw a curveball {{by the time he was}} eight years old, and could throw a ball [...] when he was nine. To assist his son, Feller senior started growing wheat on his farm, a less labor-intensive crop than corn, to allow his son more time to play baseball. Originally the Fellers were Roman Catholics but converted to Methodism after Feller's father was reprimanded by their parish priest for letting him play on Sundays. Feller later suggested that his arm strength and ball speed during his major league career came from his childhood work milking cows, picking corn, and baling hay. He recalled his childhood fondly: [...] "What kid wouldn't enjoy the life I led in Iowa? Baseball and farming, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> best of both worlds." [...] The family's farm is on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

Most famously playing the recurring role of Clifford in Acorn Antiques, he also advertised a men's bra, was [...] "Corin Huntley" [...] – a documentary presenter – and was the voice of the monster Crayola in Wood's parody of Doctor Who. Wood said of Duncan, [...] "He hasn't been exploited properly in the show because I tend to write parts for women, which is fair enough, but it does mean that Duncan plays the bank manager or the man in the hotel. I don't like men's men. Duncan's mainly the sort of man who likes women, so you can talk to him about your ovaries and it causes no embarrassment". Preston said he was cast [...] "because I was so tall".|$|E
500|$|Bakke {{complained to}} Dr. George Lowrey, {{chairman}} of the admissions committee at the medical school, about the special admissions program. [...] At Lowrey's request, Assistant Dean Peter Storandt told Bakke his candidacy had come close and encouraged him to reapply. [...] If he was not accepted the second time, “he could then research the legal question. [...] He {{had been a good}} candidate. [...] I thought he’d be accepted and that would end the matter.” [...] Storandt also gave Bakke the names of two lawyers interested in the issue of affirmative action. The general counsel for the University of California said, “I don’t think Storandt meant to injure the university. [...] It’s simply an example of a non-lawyer advising on legal matters.” [...] Storandt stated, “I simply gave Allan the response you’d give an irate customer, to try and cool his anger. [...] I realized the university might be vulnerable to legal attack because of its quota, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> feeling by then that somebody somewhere would sue the school, but I surely didn’t know this would be the case.” Storandt was demoted and later left the university.

John Lanchester dined there for The Guardian, on the second night following the opening, but complained of the cost of the meal which he thought at £60 for three courses including cover charge and VAT made it the most expensive in London. He said that the starter of ravioli of seafood with sauce vierge was [...] "good but not dumbfounding", while the lobster salad suffered from the lobster being slightly chewy. He called both main courses [...] "the business"; they were a saddle of rabbit served with a herb risotto, leeks, asparagus and a rosemary au jus; the other course was ham wrapped sweetbreads, he added were [...] "stupendously good", served with braised lettuice and cep confit.
