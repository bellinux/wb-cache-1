5|$|Thief II: The Metal <b>Age</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 2000 stealth {{video game}} {{developed}} by Looking Glass Studios {{and published by}} Eidos Interactive. Like its predecessor , the game follows Garrett, a master thief who works in and around a steampunk metropolis called the City. The player assumes the role of Garrett as he unravels a conspiracy related to a new religious sect. Garrett takes on missions such as burglaries and frameups, while trying to avoid detection by guards and automated security.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Tenar does not become a wizard (like Ged) or a king (like Arren, the primary {{character}} of The Farthest Shore), Cummins argues that her growth is more revolutionary than either of theirs. In contrast to the male bildungsroman in which characters grow into the characteristics society believes they should have, Tenar's coming of <b>age</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> female bildungsroman, in which she must struggle against the patriarchal Kargish empire. She learns to value herself for herself and not simply {{for her role as}} a priestess. She is helped through this process by Ged, who sees her as a powerful person, and helps her find choices that she did not see. Over the course of the story she realized that her true power is not her authority as the reincarnated high priestess, but the ability to make the choice to leave the labyrinth and the Tombs. Le Guin suggests that true power is not only about authority and mastery, but trust and collaboration.|$|E
5|$|Regarding incidence, cohort {{longitudinal}} studies (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD, {{which means that}} half of new dementia cases each year are AD. Advancing <b>age</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every {{five years after the}} age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. There are also sex differences in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85. The risk of dying from Alzheimer's disease is 26% higher among the non-Hispanic white population than among the non-Hispanic black population, whereas the Hispanic population has a 30% lower risk than the non-Hispanic white population.|$|E

25|$|Premature <b>aging</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{result of}} Mis-construction during {{development}} {{as a consequence of}} gene mutations, whereas normal <b>aging</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> result of accumulation of Misrepairs for the survival of an organism.

25|$|The Stone <b>Age</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> broad prehistoric {{period during}} which stone was widely used in the {{manufacture}} of implements with a sharp edge, a point, or a percussion surface. The period lasted roughly 2.5 million years, from the time of early hominids to Homo sapiens in the later Pleistocene era, and largely ended between 6000 and 2000 BCE with the advent of metalworking.|$|E
25|$|Early old <b>age</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{pleasant}} time; {{children are}} grown, retirement from work, time to pursue interests.

25|$|An astrological <b>age</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{time period}} in astrology that {{parallels}} {{major changes in}} the development of Earth's inhabitants, particularly relating to culture, society and politics, and there are twelve astrological ages corresponding to the twelve zodiacal signs. Astrological ages occur because of a phenomenon known as the precession of the equinoxes, and one complete period of this precession is called a Great Year or Platonic Year of about 25,920 years.|$|E
25|$|The Nordic Bronze Age (also Northern Bronze Age, or Scandinavian Bronze <b>Age)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{period of}} Scandinavian {{prehistory}} from c. 1700–500 BC. The Bronze Age culture of this era succeeded the Nordic Stone Age culture (Late Neolithic) and {{was followed by}} the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The archaeological legacy of the Nordic Bronze Age culture is rich, but the ethnic and linguistic affinities of it are unknown, in the absence of written sources. Some scholars also include sites in what is now Estonia, northern Germany and Pomerania, as part of its cultural sphere.|$|E

25|$|The rape {{specific}} adaptation hypothesis {{suggests that}} rape is an evolved behaviour {{because it provides}} direct benefits to the rapist. In this case, the benefit would be a higher chance of reproductive success through increasing mate number. The hypothesis suggests that rape behaviour {{is the result of}} psychological mechanisms designed specifically to influence males to rape, unlike in the by-product hypothesis. This theory suggests that rape by a man which offers no chance of reproductive success, i.e. the rape of any other person who is not a female of reproductive <b>age,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> maladaptive byproduct of this evolutionary adaptation.|$|E
25|$|Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} {{is estimated to}} affect one out of ten people during their lifetime and {{is the most common}} nerve compression syndrome. It accounts for about 90% of all nerve compression syndromes. In the U.S., 5% of people have the effects of carpal {{tunnel syndrome}}. Caucasians have the highest risk of CTS compared with other races such as non-white South Africans. Women suffer more from CTS than men with a ratio of 3:1 between the ages of 45–60 years. Only 10% of reported cases of CTS are younger than 30 years. Increasing <b>age</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> risk factor. CTS is also common in pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Inequality {{may exist}} {{between members of}} {{different}} generations within a family. Assimilation into American society may create changes in the traditional family structure, particularly among immigrants who come from cultures in which <b>age</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> strong determinant of status and power. American culture places {{a high value on}} individuality. The high importance placed on self-determination in American culture may go against the traditional values of cultures in which children are expected to obey and respect the wishes of their parents in all facets of their lives. The migration process is often stressful and can lead to conflicts between family members, particularly those of different generations.|$|E

25|$|The {{usage of}} names {{is governed by}} strict norms in {{traditional}} Korean society. It is generally considered rude to address people by their given names in Korean culture. This is particularly the case when dealing with adults or one's elders. It is acceptable to call someone {{by his or her}} given name {{if he or she is}} the same age as the speaker. However, it is considered rude to use someone's given name if that person's <b>age</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> year older than the speaker. This is often a source of pragmatic difficulty for learners of Korean as a foreign language, and for Korean learners of Western languages.|$|E
25|$|Myth III: The Wolf <b>Age</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{real-time}} tactics game, and as such, {{unlike the}} gameplay in real-time strategy games, the player {{does not have}} to engage in resource micromanagement or economic macromanagement, {{does not have to}} construct a base or buildings, and does not have to gradually build up their army by acquiring resources and researching new technologies. Instead, each level begins with the player's army already assembled and ready for combat. During the game, the player controls forces of various sizes made up of a number of different units, each possessing their own strengths and weaknesses. In single-player mode, only Light units are playable, but in online multiplayer mode, the player can control both Light and Dark units.|$|E
25|$|<b>Age</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{major risk}} factor for most common {{neurodegenerative}} diseases, including mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease. While much {{research has focused on}} diseases of aging, there are few informative studies on the molecular biology of the aging brain (usually spelled ageing brain in British English) in the absence of neurodegenerative disease or the neuropsychological profile of healthy older adults. However, research does suggest that the aging process is associated with several structural, chemical, and functional changes in the brain as well as a host of neurocognitive changes. Recent reports in model organisms suggest that as organisms age, there are distinct changes in the expression of genes at the single neuron level. This page is devoted to reviewing the changes associated with healthy aging.|$|E

25|$|The Space <b>Age</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> period {{encompassing}} {{the activities}} related to the Space Race, space exploration, space technology, and the cultural developments influenced by these events. The Space Age began {{with the development of}} several technologies that culminated with the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union in October 1957. This was the world's first artificial satellite, orbiting the Earth in 98.1 minutes and weighing in at 83kg. The launch of Sputnik 1 ushered a new era of political, scientific and technological achievements that became known as the Space Age. The Space Age was characterized by rapid development of new technology in a close race mostly between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Space Age brought the first human spaceflight during the Vostok programme and reached its peak with the Apollo program which captured the imagination of much of the world's population. The landing of Apollo 11 was an event watched by over 500 million people around the world and is widely {{recognized as one of the}} defining moments of the 20th century. Since then and with the end of the space race due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, public attention has largely moved to other areas.|$|E
