5|$|Taizong's {{adoption}} of the Heavenly Kaghan title was used to legitimize {{his role as a}} steppe khan not solely as a Chinese emperor with the title of Son of Heaven. He valued the kaghan title and was sincere about his role as a leader of Central Asia.

5|$|On 9 January 1935, Đujić {{presided over}} <b>a</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> twenty newly {{recruited}} Chetniks {{in a village}} just north of Knin, together with General Ljubo Novaković and one of Pećanac's commanders. The gathering was held {{in full view of}} the villagers, and marked the first time that Đujić publicly donned a Chetnik uniform. This consisted of World War I-era Serbian Army battledress and a black lambswool cap known as a šubara, with skull and crossbones insignia. On 6 September 1935, Đujić formed a Chetnik organisation in Vrlika. Several months later, he assembled a band of 70 Chetniks in the villages of Otrić and Velika Popina.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Barton Fink is {{loosely based on}} Clifford Odets, a playwright from New York who in the 1930s joined the Group Theatre, <b>a</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> dramatists which included Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasberg. Their work emphasized social issues and employed Stanislavski's system of acting to recreate human experience as truthfully as possible. Several of Odets' plays were successfully performed on Broadway, including Awake and Sing! and Waiting for Lefty (both in 1935). When public tastes turned away from politically engaged theatre and toward the familial realism of Eugene O'Neill, Odets had difficulty producing successful work, so he moved to Hollywood and spent 20 years writing film scripts.|$|E

5|$|The church {{remained}} incomplete {{for over}} ninety years. By 1957 Anglican services {{were being held}} in St Stephens, a wooden church next to the apparent ruin. Around this time some in the church showed interest in completion of the old structure, {{partly due to the}} approaching centenary of construction beginning. In April of that year <b>a</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> people from the Parish of Carrick was held in the unfinished building, and a prayer held to bless its completion. The gathering, and associated committee, were led and chaired by W R Barrett, assistant bishop of Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} Scout jamboree is <b>a</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> Boy Scouts {{from across}} the US. It is usually held every four years, with some adjustment for special years such as the 2010 National Scout Jamboree that celebrated the BSA centennial. The first jamboree was held in 1937 at the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. Since then, jamborees have been held in varying locations. Beginning in 1981, the jamboree has been held at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia. A permanent location owned by the BSA was sought in 2008 for future jamborees, high adventure programs and training. The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve near Beckley, West Virginia is now the permanent site beginning with the 2013 National Scout Jamboree.|$|E
5|$|The revolutionary {{executive}} left Islaz at {{the head}} of <b>a</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> soldiers and various others, and, after passing through Caracal, triumphantly entered Craiova without meeting resistance from local forces. According to one account, the gathering comprised as many as 150,000 armed civilians. As these events were unfolding, Bibescu was shot at in Bucharest by Alexandru or Iancu Paleologu (the father of French diplomat Maurice Paléologue) and his co-conspirators, whose bullets only managed to tear one of the Prince's epaulettes. Over the following hours, police forces clamped down of Frăția, arresting Rosetti and a few other members, but failing to capture most of them.|$|E

5|$|Angela (Angela Kinsey) and Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) {{are celebrating}} their son Phillip's first {{birthday}} with <b>a</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> wealthy political allies. Angela is {{shocked to learn}} that Robert invited his lover Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) to the party after she told Robert {{she did not want}} him there. Angela invites Dwight (her own extramarital lover) in retaliation, but he scorns the invitation. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) hears of this and eagerly volunteers to go in Dwight's place. Oscar, who believes he was invited because Robert is in love with him, is hurt when he finds out that he was invited to boost Robert's opinion in the polls among Latino voters. During the taking of a group photo, Robert has Oscar stand in a spot where he almost completely blocks off Angela, and Oscar and Angela begin to bicker with each other. After the party, Robert rebukes them for their behavior and admonishes them to do better in the future. However, Kevin interrupts to tell Robert that he is a terrible person for treating Angela and Oscar strictly as a means to gain political support.|$|E
5|$|In 1783, the Kodavas {{erupted in}} revolt against Tipu and threw their forces out of Coorg. In 1785, he marched into Mercara {{the capital of}} Coorg and {{addressed}} them. He showed racial and religious bias by stating that the Kodavas were guilty of polyandry in a speech before <b>a</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> Kodavas. He mistook the patrilineal patriarchal Kodavas to be a sub-group of matriarchal Nairs. He threatened {{that he would not}} revile or molest a single individual among them, but instead make Ahmadis (Muslims) out of the whole of them; transplanting them from their homeland in the Coorg to Seringapatam. This inflammatory speech with false accusations of polyandry and an open threat angered the Kodavas who thereafter hated Tipu and again revolted against him. Tipu seized nearly 70,000 Hindus of Coorg along with their king, Dodda Vira-Rajendra, and held them captive at Seringapatam. They were also forcibly converted to Islam and received the same harsh treatment as the Mangalorean Catholics. From 1786 until 1789, even the Nairs of Malabar were captured and deported to Seringapatam.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the explanation by the women {{that they had been}} caught up in what is now called a time slip and had observed ghosts from the past, a non-supernatural explanation of the events was proposed by Philippe Jullian in his 1965 biography of the aristocratic decadent French poet Robert de Montesquiou. At the time of Moberly and Jourdain's excursion to Versailles, Montesquiou lived nearby and reportedly gave parties in the grounds where his friends dressed in period costume and performed tableaux vivants as part of the party entertainments. Moberly and Jourdain may have inadvertently gatecrashed a gay fancy dress party. The Marie-Antoinette figure could have been a society lady or a cross-dresser, the pockmarked man Montesquiou himself. It was suggested that <b>a</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> the French decadent avant-garde of the time could have made a sinister impression on the two middle-class Edwardian spinsters who would have been little used to such company.|$|E

5|$|In the Roman {{system of}} direct democracy, two primary types of gatherings {{were used to}} vote on legislative, electoral, and {{judicial}} matters. The first was the Assembly (comitia), which was a gathering that was deemed to represent the entire Roman people, {{even if it did}} not contain all of the Roman citizens or, like the comitia curiata, excluded a particular class of Roman citizens (the plebs). The second was the Council (concilium), which was <b>a</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> citizens of a specific class. In contrast, the Convention was an unofficial forum for communication. Conventions were simply forums where Romans met for specific unofficial purposes, such as, for example, to hear a political speech. Voters always assembled first into Conventions to hear debates and conduct other business before voting, and then into Assemblies or Councils to actually vote.|$|E
5|$|Mary Docherty (27 April 1908 – 2 February 2000) was {{an activist}} {{and member of}} the Communist Party of Great Britain. Born to a working-class family in Cowdenbeath, Scotland, she was {{influenced}} by the communist beliefs of her father, a miner, {{as well as by the}} poverty she grew up in. She joined the Communist Party at the age of 18, and in 1929 traveled to the Soviet Union as a Scottish delegate to <b>a</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> young communists. She founded a local children's wing of the Communist Party, carried out a successful agitation to declare 1 May a school holiday, and worked for communist Member of Parliament Willie Gallacher. She retired from active politics at the age of 60, but continued to give talks and write her memoirs, published in 1991 as A Miner's Lass.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June, {{helicopter}} gunships conducted dawn {{air strikes}} against insurgents who were attacking troops at the university campus. By this point, the city had been coming under continuous air strikes for three days, which included barrel bombs. An all-out ground offensive was launched during the day {{in an attempt to}} capture the city. A column of troops started out from Samarra towards Tikrit to the north and by sundown had reached the edge of the city. According to Lt. Gen. Ahmed Abu Ragheef, another column was directed towards the Camp Speicher air base. There were initial claims by government sources of capturing Tikrit, but in fact Tikrit itself remained under insurgent control as heavy fighting continued to rage on the city outskirts during the night. In the evening, helicopters struck <b>a</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> people preparing for a wedding ceremony in the village of Al Bu Hayazi, east of Tikrit, killing four civilians.|$|E

5|$|The Order of the Arrow is {{organized}} into four regions, Central, Southern, Northeast and Western Region; {{the boundaries of}} each OA region correspond with {{the boundaries of the}} BSA's regions. Each region has an elected region chief, a volunteer adult who is appointed as the region chairman to oversee its region Committee, and an appointed professional (staff) adviser. Each region chief is elected at the national planning meeting the day after the election of the national chief and vice chief by a caucus of the section chiefs from the given region. The members of the region committee consist of the region chief, the region chairman, all national committeemen from the region, and other appointed adult volunteers. Each region annually has <b>a</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> all section officers and advisers. As a region, they are trained in topics relevant to their jobs. Each region also provides opportunities for Order of the Arrow members to go through a National Leadership Seminar. This weekend course is highly rated and a lasting memory for many members.|$|E
5|$|The Pevensies save Trumpkin {{from being}} drowned by two Telmarines. Trumpkin is {{convinced}} that the four children are the Kings and Queens of Old, and they continue on together. Nikabrik and Trufflehunter lead Caspian to <b>a</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> Narnians, where Caspian convinces them to help him win his throne so he can return their land. They meet the Pevensies and Trumpkin, and all journey to Aslan's How. Peter decides they will attack Miraz's castle, rejecting Lucy's advice that they wait for Aslan to return. The Narnians raid Miraz's castle, but Caspian ruins the plan by freeing Cornelius instead of opening the gate. He learns that Miraz killed his father, and confronts Miraz but is wounded. Overwhelmed, Peter calls for a retreat. Peter, Susan, Edmund, Caspian and the Narnians escape with heavy losses. Upon returning to Aslan's How, Peter and Caspian argue, while back at the castle, Miraz is crowned King.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} a Linguistic Institute was first {{proposed}} {{in the spring of}} 1927 by Reinhold Saleski. The fledgling Society was hesitant at first, but Edgar Sturtevant was keen on the idea. Sturtevant molded Saleski's idea into a model still used today: <b>a</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> scholars in conjunction with coursework. The Executive Committee voted to authorize the first Linguistic Institute, to be held 1928, along with authorization for a second institute in 1929. After the fourth Institute in 1931, the program took a four-year hiatus due to the great depression. Institutes were held every year concurrently with summer meetings of the LSA until 1988 when, due to increasing costs, the Society announced that the Linguistic Institutes would be held every other year. It was at that same time that the summer meeting of the LSA was also discontinued.|$|E
