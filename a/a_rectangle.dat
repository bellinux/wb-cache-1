5|$|As well as solar alignments, {{there are}} {{proposed}} lunar alignments. The four station stones mark out <b>a</b> <b>rectangle.</b> The short sides point towards the midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset. The long sides if viewed towards the south-east, face the most southerly rising of the moon. Aveni notes that these lunar alignments have never gained the acceptance that the solar alignments have received. The Heel Stone azimuth is one-seventh of circumference, matching the latitude of Avebury, while summer solstice sunrise azimuth {{is no longer}} equal to the construction era direction.|$|E
5|$|The first crest {{to appear}} on a Partick Thistle kit was a thistle design, and every logo since has {{featured}} a thistle. The thistle appeared first in 1902, then again in 1909. It remained until 1978, when a new logo with the thistle housed inside a roundel was used. A modernist logo with the thistle on <b>a</b> <b>rectangle</b> was introduced in 1990, and the current crest was introduced in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Ferb {{was given}} a simplistic {{structure}} so that young audiences {{would be able to}} draw him easily. As with the other characters of Phineas and Ferb, Ferb's design is constructed of geometric shapes in homage to animator Tex Avery. Ferb's head is based on <b>a</b> <b>rectangle</b> with a wider top than bottom. A square is used for his nose, and an egg-shaped oval is used for his eyes. The eye furthest from the screen is always drawn larger than the other. Povenmire uses a nine-step process to draw Ferb, starting with his head and ending with touch ups.|$|E
50|$|The root-φ <b>rectangle</b> is <b>a</b> dynamic <b>rectangle</b> but not <b>a</b> root <b>rectangle.</b> Its {{diagonal}} equals φ {{times the}} length of the shorter side. If <b>a</b> root-φ <b>rectangle</b> is divided by a diagonal, the result is two congruent Kepler triangles.|$|R

5|$|Mathematicians {{use some}} {{technical}} terms when discussing tilings. An edge is the intersection between two bordering tiles; {{it is often}} a straight line. A vertex {{is the point of}} intersection of three or more bordering tiles. Using these terms, an isogonal or vertex-transitive tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of polygons about each vertex is the same. The fundamental region is a shape such as <b>a</b> <b>rectangle</b> that is repeated to form the tessellation. For example, a regular tessellation of the plane with squares has a meeting of four squares at every vertex.|$|E
5|$|When Antonio da Sangallo was {{commissioned}} {{to rebuild the}} church, his main problem was its shape; its width, facing Piazza Scossacavalli, was longer than its depth (along Borgo Vecchio). Drawings in the Uffizi indicate several solutions: a single-nave plan, oriented along its long side with a side entrance, and octagonal and oval plans. The latter was adopted by Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola for the church of Sant'Anna dei Palafrenieri, and became popular during the 17th century. Sangallo did not adopt any of these plans, instead deciding to reduce {{the area of the}} church, whose plan became <b>a</b> <b>rectangle</b> with its long side normal to Piazza Scossacavalli. Its nave was flanked by four large niches, and Sangallo designed four rooms (two on each side) as sacristies.|$|E
5|$|Upon formation, the 2/15th {{was placed}} {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Robert Marlan, an Australian Staff Corps officer of the Permanent Military Forces who arrived on {{promotion}} from major, having previously served in World War I with the 20th Battalion. The colours initially chosen for the battalion's Unit Colour Patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 15th Battalion, a unit that had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were initially purple and red in a diamond shape, but after representations from World War I veterans the colour patch was changed to brown over dark blue, in <b>a</b> <b>rectangle</b> shape. The patch was placed inside a grey diamond border added to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; this would change following the unit's involvement in the fighting at Tobruk, when it adopted a 'T'-shaped UCP consisting of blue and green.|$|E

5|$|The {{national}} flag has {{a length of}} 2.20meters and a width of 1.47m, a ratio of 2 to 3. The field is split into three horizontal colored bands, a yellow band of one-half the flag's width, a blue band of one-quarter the width, and a red band of one-quarter the width. All three bands extend {{the full length of}} the flag. The flag is charged with the Ecuadorian coat of arms scaled to one-half the width of the flag and centered in the field. The coat of arms itself is constructed in <b>a</b> <b>rectangle</b> with proportions 12:10. The national standard has the same design as the {{national flag}}, but is square, with length 0.9m and width 0.9m. When used by military units and organizations, lettering can encircle the coat of arms with a diameter of 55 centimeters. The lettering must be 4cm in height, 3cm in width, gold-colored Roman font, embroidered with gold thread. The only other regulated size is a table flag (banderola) where the flag is 200mm wide and 300mm long. When manufacturing the national flag, sellers to the public must include the name of their company, along with the year of manufacture, by placing a 20 × 10mm tag on the reverse side of the flag on the sleeve.|$|E
25|$|Multiplication {{can also}} be visualized as {{counting}} objects arranged in <b>a</b> <b>rectangle</b> (for whole numbers) or as finding the area of <b>a</b> <b>rectangle</b> whose sides have given lengths. The area of <b>a</b> <b>rectangle</b> {{does not depend on}} which side is measured first, which illustrates the commutative property. The product of two measurements is a new type of measurement, for instance multiplying the lengths of the two sides of <b>a</b> <b>rectangle</b> gives its area, this is the subject of dimensional analysis.|$|E
25|$|A {{corollary}} is {{a proposition}} that follows with little proof from another theorem or definition. Also a corollary {{can be a}} theorem restated for a more restricted special case.

There are certain implications among these, both obvious (for example, if a polyomino tiles the half plane then it tiles the whole plane) and less so (for example, if a polyomino tiles an enlarged copy of itself, then it tiles the quadrant). Polyominoes of orders up to 6 are characterized in this hierarchy (with {{the status of}} one hexomino, later found to tile <b>a</b> <b>rectangle,</b> unresolved at that time).|$|E
