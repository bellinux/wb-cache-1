5|$|Refined cuisine {{could be}} moralized {{as a sign}} of either civilized {{progress}} or decadent decline. The early Imperial historian Tacitus contrasted the indulgent luxuries of the Roman table in his day with the simplicity of the Germanic diet of fresh wild meat, foraged fruit, and cheese, unadulterated by imported seasonings and elaborate sauces. Most often, because of the importance of landowning in Roman culture, produce—cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruit—was considered a more civilized form of food than meat. The Mediterranean staples of bread, wine, and oil were sacralized by Roman Christianity, while Germanic meat consumption became a mark of paganism, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> the product of animal sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> {{set up to}} test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed {{on top of the}} flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E

They later catch up with Arthur to tell about the dagger and Excalibur in Emma's possession, Arthur tells them that Emma merged the two together it could either snuff out light or dark magic, leading Mary Margaret to believe that Emma might be trying to eliminate the light magic.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{randomized}} {{study in}} medical literature that {{has studied the}} response with amputation of patients who have failed the above-mentioned therapies and who continue to be miserable. Nonetheless, {{there are reports that}} on average cite about half of the patients will have resolution of their pain, while half will develop phantom limb pain and/or pain at the amputation site. It is likely that as in any other chronic pain syndrome, the brain becomes chronically stimulated with pain, and late amputation may not work as well <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> expected. In a survey of fifteen patients with CRPS Type 1, eleven responded that their life was better after amputation. Since this is the ultimate treatment of a painful extremity, it should be left as a last resort.|$|E
25|$|Previous to Dugger, {{several books}} claimed Scott was a {{mistress}} of Hal Wallis, then married to actress Louise Fazenda. Wallis had a falling out with Scott {{around the time}} of Bad for Each Other, with recriminations on Wallis' part. After Scott freelanced for a few years, Wallis made an effort to revive the relationship by making Scott the leading lady opposite Presley, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> his last chance to star Scott in anything. After shooting was completed, Scott walked away from film acting to try her hand at singing. The 14-year-relationship that began at the Stork Club in 1943 came to an end. Scott herself knew the relationship was over—only Wallis remained in denial. After Louise's death in 1962, Wallis went into a depression and became a recluse before marrying Martha Hyer in 1966. In later life, he was reticent on the subject of Scott, despite an unjealous Hyer urging him to include Scott and his other mistresses in his autobiography. Though Casablanca was the film of which Wallis was most proud, the ones he watched repeatedly were those starring Lizabeth Scott. Even during his second marriage, Wallis continued to screen Scott's films at home, night after night.|$|E

500|$|In {{film editor}} Susan Korda's 2005 lecture, [...] "We'll Fix It in the Edit!?", at the Berlinale Talent Campus, she broadly {{explained}} {{the contribution of}} editing to the film: [...] "What is fascinating in Jaws is that the shark has a personality, the shark has an intelligence, indeed sometimes I think the shark {{has a sense of}} humor, morbid <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be.</b> And that was all achieved in the first two acts of the film before you see the shark. So the cutting was very essential for that." [...] David Bordwell has used the second shark attack scene in Jaws as (literally) a textbook illustration of an editing innovation that occurred in the late 1960s. The innovation, which Fields herself named the [...] "wipe by cut", can be used when a character is filmed from a distance using a telephoto lens. The cut to a different framing of the character occurs during the interruption by a figure who passes between the camera and the character. The cut thus masks itself, and avoids drawing the viewer's attention away from the narrative of the scene.|$|E
500|$|Hunt's songwriting on {{the album}} is {{characterized}} by resolute lyrics, multi-layered storylines, social commentary, a droll perspective, poetic subtlety, thematic subtext, and whimsy. Songs {{on the album}} are unified by a theme of tension and dissonance in modern life. The songs explore topics and issues in contemporary society and culture, including gentrification, identity politics, and mass consumption, accompanied {{by a sense of}} hope in Hunt's lyrics. Hunt explains the album to have a [...] "loose concept", with songs unified by subject matter concerning [...] "unspoken issues around society", and says of his lyrical sentiments on the album, [...] "It fits my personality that no matter what's going on I'm going to answer it honestly with a wink and a smile. As cliché <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> I feel like every situation needs a laugh." [...] L. Michael Gipson of Creative Loafing notes David Bowie and Lenny Kravitz as references points for Hunt's songwriting, and writes that What Were You Hoping For? explores [...] "both sides of the political aisles" [...] with metaphorical songs such as [...] "North Hollywood", [...] "Designer Jeans", and the title track, as well as themes concerning an intimate relationship with the songs [...] "Moving Targets", [...] "Falls (Violet)", and [...] "Cross Dresser".|$|E

500|$|The {{characters}} and their stories {{served as an}} extension of the fantasy life Bannon developed as a child. They became her [...] "fantasy friends" [...] whose loves and lives she witnessed and through which she lived her own life vicariously, helping her through a difficult marriage, and a longing for a life she did not feel she was free to live. [...] "I realized very early that I should not marry, but I was going to make the best of a bad thing, and I was going to make it a good thing," [...] she remembered. Having no practical experience in a lesbian relationship while writing Odd Girl Out, she set out to gain what she termed [...] "fieldwork experience" [...] in her trips to Greenwich Village, and was successful enough to introduce those experiences into the next book in the series before relocating once more to Southern California. But she explained her fears about staying in Greenwich Village, saying I would sit there (in a gay bar) in the evenings thinking, 'What if (a police raid) happens tonight and I get hauled off to the slam with all these other women?' I had been extremely low profile, very proper, very Victorian wife. I know that sounds crazy in the 60s, but I was raised by my mother and grandmother, who really came out of that era, and talk about a rigid role-playing crowd! I couldn't imagine living through it. I just couldn't. I thought, 'Well, that would do it. I'd have to go jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.' As easy <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> if you were a young woman in today's generation to think that was exaggerating, it wasn't. It was terrifying.|$|E
500|$|Comparing Jack's {{relationship}} with Ianto to his romantic tension with Gwen, David-Lloyd states [...] "I think [...] different sorts of love or lust, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> and I think that's an ongoing thing ... At the moment, I think there's two different sorts of love going on there." [...] He also {{states that he}} feels that Ianto's {{relationship with}} Jack is his first same-sex relationship, and doesn't feel that Ianto would be a [...] "labelist", but were he, he would identify as bisexual, but that he [...] "wouldn't regard himself {{the same way as}} Jack does because they're from different times." [...] Author Stephen James Walker feels sorry for Ianto, perceiving his relationship with Jack as a one-sided one. To him, Ianto views the relationship as [...] "serious and committed", as seen in [...] "A Day in the Death" [...] where he tells Owen that it is not just about sex. However, from dialogue in [...] "Something Borrowed", Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a [...] "recreational activity". Walker also notes how important it was for Ianto when he cut in to dance with Jack, as {{this is the first time}} that his relationship with Jack is presented before the rest of the crew. The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Gwen tries to clarify whether Ianto understands the nature of his relationship with Jack, saying [...] "You do know he's ...", which Ianto finishes [...] "Just a shag?" [...] before adding [...] "Yes I know. I can't help it, though. I've never been much good at casual." [...] In radio play [...] "The Dead Line", set just prior to series three, Ianto expounds his insecurities to Jack, who refutes them, confirming that his feelings for Ianto are real. When asked if the relationship will continue in series three, executive producer Julie Gardner replied, [...] "Yes, I like seeing them as a couple", while director Euros Lyn stated that [...] "the love story between Captain Jack and Ianto [...] to unfold" [...] in the third series. While Gareth David-Lloyd feels that the love story between Jack and Ianto was not fully resolved, which is [...] "part of the tragedy", the character and his relationship with Jack had been sufficiently explored in the third series for David-Lloyd to be [...] "happy to walk away from it." ...|$|E
