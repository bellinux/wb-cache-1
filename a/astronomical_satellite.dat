In 1983, Vega {{became the first}} star {{found to have a}} disk of dust. The Infrared <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Satellite</b> (IRAS) discovered an excess of infrared radiation coming from the star, and this was attributed to energy emitted by the orbiting dust as it was heated by the star.|$|E

25|$|Earlier {{infrared}} observations {{had been}} made by both space-based and ground-based observatories. Ground-based observatories have the drawback that at infrared wavelengths or frequencies, both the Earth's atmosphere and the telescope itself will radiate (glow) strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere is opaque at most infrared wavelengths. This necessitates lengthy exposure times and greatly decreases the ability to detect faint objects. It could be compared to trying to observe the stars at noon. Previous space observatories (such as IRAS, the Infrared <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Satellite,</b> and ISO, the Infrared Space Observatory) were launched during the 1980s and 1990s and great advances in astronomical technology have been made since then.|$|E
25|$|The {{birth of}} the modern widely {{accepted}} theory of planetary formation—the Solar Nebular Disk Model (SNDM)—can {{be traced to the}} works of Soviet astronomer Victor Safronov. His book Evolution of the protoplanetary cloud and formation of the Earth and the planets, which was translated to English in 1972, had a long-lasting effect on the way scientists thought about the formation of the planets. In this book almost all major problems of the planetary formation process were formulated and some of them solved. Safronov's ideas were further developed in the works of George Wetherill, who discovered runaway accretion. By the early 1980s, the nebular hypothesis in the form of SNDM had come back into favour, led by two major discoveries in astronomy. First, a number of apparently young stars, such as Beta Pictoris, were found to be surrounded by discs of cool dust, much as was predicted by the nebular hypothesis. Second, the Infrared <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Satellite,</b> launched in 1983, observed that many stars had an excess of infrared radiation that could be explained if they were orbited by discs of cooler material.|$|E

[...] After this administrative interlude, he went to the Gemini Observatory, where he became Project Scientist.

40|$|Abstract—A unique {{electronics}} {{system has}} been built and tested for reading signals from the silicon-strip detectors of the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope mission. The system amplifies and processes signals from 884, 736 36 -cm long silicon strips in a 4 × 4 array of tower modules. An aggressive mechanical design fits the readout electronics in narrow spaces between the tower modules, to minimize dead area. This design and the resulting departures from conventional electronics packaging led to several fabrication challenges and lessons learned. This paper describes the fabrication processes and how the problems peculiar to this design were overcome.
