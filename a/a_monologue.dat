5|$|Although Carnivàle {{is set in}} the mid-1930s, Ben and Brother Justin have {{visions and}} dreams {{suggesting}} the story began much earlier. Samson summarizes the backstory in <b>a</b> <b>monologue</b> at the beginning of season 2, without mentioning names. The Pitch Document, which served as the source for the character biographies on the HBO website, provides context for all clues.|$|E
5|$|Patricia Routledge starred as Kitty, the self-righteous {{spinster}} from Cheadle in weekly monologues.

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} March 7, 1988 {{with a budget}} of $15 million. Filming began in Jackson, Mississippi, where the production team filmed a church being burned down. The sequence required a multiple-camera setup; {{a total of three}} cameras were used during the shoot. On March 8, the production team filmed a scene set in a motel where Anderson (Hackman) delivers <b>a</b> <b>monologue</b> to Ward (Dafoe). On March 10, production moved to a remote corner of Mississippi, where the crew filmed the burning of a parish church.|$|E
5|$|The film Il giorno di San Sebastiano (Saint Sebastian's Day) (1993), {{directed}} by Pasquale Scimeca, {{is based on}} the Caltavuturo massacre on January 20, 1893, when during the celebration of Saint Sebastian, a firing squad killed 15 peasants who claimed their right to state-owned land. It won a Golden Globe and was presented at the Venice film festival. The play, <b>a</b> <b>monologue</b> depicting a peasant woman whose husband was killed in the events at Caltavuturo, was written by Rosario Garibaldi Bosco and first performed on February 2, 1893, in Palermo {{to raise money for the}} victims.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} <b>a</b> <b>monologue</b> given by fashion model Agyness Deyn. Scenes of Rihanna with her romantic {{interest}} (Dudley O'Shaughnessy) in both love and hate scenarios intersperse, as they experience mounting difficulties in their relationship. After enduring the overwhelming effects of recreational drugs and physical violence, she finds her boyfriend unconscious {{on the floor}} of his apartment, and leaves him, having had enough of the relationship. Images of the song's producer and featured artist Calvin Harris appear in outdoor DJ scenes, while the video has regular references to popular culture, such as themes of films and content of other singers' videos.|$|E

Bubblegum considers its impact {{an attack on}} her kingdom and tells Johnnie to hide {{at the foot of}} their desk. When Lumpy finds Johnnie, she uses the device on him, attempting to revert him to when he loved her. Johnnie disappears; when Bubblegum figures out what has happened, she informs Lumpy that by failing to log his molecules, he no longer exists as part of their universe. To avoid having to grieve, Lumpy asks Bubblegum to use the device, properly, on her. Erased of her memory past her attacking Bubblegum, Lumpy storms out. Bubblegum pours herself a drink.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, Susan, Russell, wrangler Carter Blake, marine {{biologist}} Janice Higgins, and engineer Tom Scoggins witness the shark smash Jim's stretcher against the laboratory's main window, drowning him and flooding the facility. With few options left, the group {{goes to the}} facility's wet entry, where they plan to take a submersible to escape. Upon being confronted, Susan confesses to the others that she and Jim genetically engineered the sharks to increase their brain size, as they were not large enough to harvest sufficient amounts of the protein complex; this has the side effect of making them smarter and deadly. When the group reaches the wet entry, they discover that the submersible has been damaged. While delivering <b>a</b> <b>monologue</b> emphasizing the need for group unity, Russell is dragged into the submersible pool by the shark and killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Samson, the diminutive co-manager of the carnival, sets up each season with <b>a</b> <b>monologue,</b> giving {{glimpses of the}} show's complex story and good-versus-evil mythology. By telling the story visually and deploying dialogue sparely, Carnivàle is a demanding show {{with a lot of}} subtext, and similar to reading chapters of a book, viewers need to watch episodes of Carnivàle in the right order or risk being spoiled with too little or too much story information. Many reviewers found the story too slow and confusing, but praised the show for its cinematography and realistic portrayal of the 1930s. Carnivàle received much award recognition in mostly technical categories, including fifteen Emmy nominations with five wins.|$|E

50|$|Interior <b>monologues</b> involve <b>a</b> {{character}} externalizing {{their thoughts}} {{so that the}} audience can witness experiences {{that would otherwise be}} mostly internal. In contrast, <b>a</b> dramatic <b>monologue</b> involves one character speaking to another character. Monologues can also be divided along the lines of active and narrative <b>monologues.</b> In <b>an</b> active <b>monologue</b> <b>a</b> character is using their speech to achieve a clear goal. Narrative <b>monologues</b> simply involve <b>a</b> character telling a story and can often be identified {{by the fact that they}} are in the past tense.|$|R
5|$|In 1995, BBC Radio {{producer}} Paul Quinn approached Kneale {{with the}} idea of making a new radio series about Quatermass, and the resulting project was produced and aired as the five-part serial The Quatermass Memoirs on BBC Radio 3 in the spring of 1996. The serial had three strands: <b>a</b> <b>monologue</b> from Kneale recounting the historical environment in which he created and wrote the original 1950s serials; archive material from the original productions and contemporary news broadcasts; and a dramatised strand set shortly before the 1979 serial, with Quatermass being visited in retreat in Scotland by a reporter eager to write his life story. Of the actors who had previously played Quatermass, only Keir and Mills were still alive; Keir took the role, his final professional performance before his death the following year. The Quatermass Memoirs was repeated several times on digital radio station BBC7 from 2003, and the serial was released on CD in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, Martin leaves Finn and Jake to save {{himself and}} the Lich appears, {{ordering}} Finn to fall. He delivers <b>a</b> <b>monologue,</b> explaining his desire to extinguish all life in the universe. Finn, overcome by the Lich's power, feebly tries to fight back and ends up throwing some of the guardian blood on the Lich, which causes him to grotesquely begin growing flesh. With the Lich disposed of, Finn pursues his father, who is hitching a ride with escaping criminals on a loose piece of the Citadel, still held on by a vein. One of the criminals cuts the vein, but Finn holds on, causing his grass sword to envelope his arm and eventually rip away, severing it. Martin escapes, and Finn and Jake share a somber moment. Jake eventually reveals to Finn that the Lich has now {{been turned into a}} large humanoid baby; the two leave him on the doorstep of Tree Trunks (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) and Mr. Pig's house.|$|E
5|$|They {{awake in}} Dr. Noah's lair at the {{pinnacle}} of Mount Everest. Noah (Sisko) enters and gives <b>a</b> <b>monologue</b> about how he will destroy the world, and shows a big red button he will push to do it. He has Bashir and Garak taken below ground, where they are handcuffed to a laser. As the time ticks down before the laser is activated, Bare performs a final check of the laser. Bashir flirts for her, and she slips him a key and hurries out. Bashir unlocks himself and Garak, who protests that it is too dangerous to continue as the safeties are turned off in the program which could result in their deaths. Garak is about to close the program and kill the other crew members when Bashir shoots him, grazing him with a bullet. Garak is shocked, but impressed and agrees to continue the programme. Bashir is concerned as he knows the program will end with either the death of Professor Bare or Colonel Komananov following the defeat of Noah.|$|E

50|$|Actors in theatre and {{sometimes}} in film and television may {{be called upon to}} use monologues for audition purposes. Audition <b>monologues</b> demonstrate <b>an</b> actor's ability to prepare a piece and deliver a performance.

The choice of <b>monologues</b> for <b>an</b> audition can often depend on the play in question or the role the actor wants to land.
