40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to provide}} a “biography” of sorts on <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Finance</b> Review. The paper tracks the {{evolution}} of <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Finance</b> Review from its introduction in 1938 to its current status. Design/methodology/approach – The paper {{is based on a}} complete review of every paper and every issue. Not all papers were read by the author, but key papers of interest that {{in one way or another}} made significant contributions to the study of <b>agricultural</b> <b>finance</b> were reviewed. Findings – The paper shows the evolution of <b>agricultural</b> <b>finance</b> from the early days of reporting financial data in the 1930 s and 1940 s, to its emergence as a major and significant sub discipline of the general field of agricultural economics. Research limitations/implications – As indicated, not all papers were fully reviewed or read. It is possible that papers identified as “firsts” may have been preceded by other papers. Nonetheless the paper identifies the basic evolutionary path of the journal and defines key points in time when a paradigm shift emerged to change the direction of this discipline. Practical implications – As <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Finance</b> Review transitions from the Department of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University to Emerald Group Publishing Limited, this “biography” provides readers with a general overview of the journal's and the discipline's historical development. Originality/value – This paper is simply a review of the existing literature found in <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Finance</b> Review. Agriculture, Farms, Finance, Risk Management, Serials...|$|R

50|$|The State offers in-kind credits, whereby seed, fertilizer, {{and other}} inputs are {{provided}} in exchange for grain harvested {{at the end of}} the season, though the use of in-kind credit is reportedly decreasing. The government also provides subsidies for the purchase of plant-protection chemicals and fertilizers, and subsidizes two-thirds of the interest rate on loans from commercial banks, which provide the majority of farm credit. Banks remain cautious and insist on certain farm management practices and minimum levels of input use before granting loans (a policy which, according to some observers, has had a significant positive effect on overall efficiency in the agricultural sector), but banks’ confidence is boosted by increasingly reliable guarantees from regional administrations who see stability of food production as a high priority. Banks recognize the inherent risk in <b>agricultural</b> <b>financing</b> but also see agriculture as less risky than other industries and are generally willing to lend money to solvent, well-managed farms.|$|E

The analysis first reviews recent trends in <b>agricultural</b> <b>financing</b> focusing on both external and domestic sources.

The paper notes that while the emerging <b>agricultural</b> <b>financing</b> mechanisms such as budget support and sector-wide approaches (SWAPs) present opportunities for enhancing the volume and effectiveness of agricultural support, they pose challenges to both donors and recipients.
