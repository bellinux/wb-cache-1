5|$|A virus particle, {{also known}} as a virion, {{consists}} of genes made from DNA or RNA which <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), helical or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a bubble of lipid (fat) called an envelope.|$|E
5|$|The heart wall {{is made up}} {{of three}} layers: the inner endocardium, middle {{myocardium}} and outer epicardium. These <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a double-membraned sac called the pericardium.|$|E
5|$|The outworks <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a ditch, a covertway and a glacis.|$|E
50|$|Haţeg Island itself <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> {{primarily}} by a deep marine basin, {{unlike some of}} the surrounding islands and land masses which <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> by shallow seas.|$|R
5|$|If {{the king}} <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> {{on all four}} sides by enemies, he is taken prisoner. If he <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> on three sides, he may escape by the fourth.|$|R
50|$|As {{the germ}} of a fruit <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by the {{perisperm}} so the spirit, properly so called, <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by an envelope which, by analogy, may be {{designated as the}} perispirit.|$|R
5|$|Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are {{icosahedral}} or near-spherical with chiral icosahedral symmetry. A regular icosahedron is {{the optimum}} way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The {{minimum number of}} identical capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by six others and are called hexons. Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved. The same protein may act as the subunit of both the pentamers and hexamers {{or they may be}} composed of different proteins.|$|E
5|$|The Parish Church of St Edmund in East Mersea {{dates from}} around the 12th or 13th century, with {{extensions}} in the late 15th or 16th. The church and hall <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a moat that {{is thought to be}} the remains of a Danish refuge after their defeat by King Alfred at Farnham.|$|E
5|$|The Wabigoon subprovince is a {{formerly}} active volcanic island chain, {{made up of}} metavolcanic-metasedimentary intrusions. These metamorphosed {{rocks are}} volcanically derived greenstone belts, and <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> and cut by granitic plutons and batholiths. The subprovince's greenstone belts consist of felsic volcanics, felsic batholiths and felsic plutons aged from 3,000 to 2,670 million years old.|$|E
50|$|An ambulacrum is an {{architectural}} {{term for the}} atrium, courtyard, or parvise {{in front of a}} basilica that <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by arcades or colonnades, often containing a fountain, and <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by trees.|$|R
50|$|The island {{itself is}} covered with trees but it <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a beach around which is a lagoon. Outside this, the whole <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a coral reef and the open ocean.|$|R
50|$|Mannar is the {{one among}} the {{beautiful}} place in Kerala, because the southern side <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by paddy fields and eastern side surrounded by the river and north and west <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by hills.|$|R
5|$|The Wawa subprovince is a {{formerly}} active volcanic island chain, {{consisting of}} metamorphosed greenstone belts which <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by and cut by granitic plutons and batholiths.

50|$|Na2Te, {{like many}} related {{compounds}} with the formula M2X, adopts the antifluorite structure. Thus, in solid Na2Te each Te2− ion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by eight Na+ ions and each Na+ ion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by four Te2− ions.|$|R
5|$|Although many Anahim volcanoes <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by Chilcotin Group basalt flows, {{the exact}} nature of their {{relationship}} is unknown. It is unlikely that the Anahim volcanoes ever were a source area for the Chilcotin basalts as they have distinct transitional geochemistries. The Chilcotin Group is interpreted to be related to back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone.|$|E
5|$|As Tyrion and Bronn head towards Tywin Lannister's camp, they <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> {{by one of}} {{the barbarian}} hill tribes of the Vale. Tyrion convinces them to serve as his escorts by {{promising}} them gold, weapons and an army to help them seize the Vale of Arryn. Tywin is displeased, but agrees to keep Tyrion's promises if the hill tribes join the fight against the Starks. The tribesmen agree, but want Tyrion to follow them as insurance, much to Tyrion's discomfort.|$|E
5|$|At the {{floodplain}} at {{the confluence of}} Ithan Creek and Darby Creek, the main trees species include silver maple, black willow, boxelder, and red maple. In the wetlands at this site, the main tree species include scattered black willow and silver maple. There are also patches of silky dogwood and wild rose, which <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by assorted wetland plants, including herbs, grasses, sedges, and rushes. However, numerous exotic plants also inhabit the site.|$|E
50|$|The last {{assumption}} {{means that}} each cation <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a spherically symmetric cloud of other ions. The cloud has a net negative charge. Similarly each anion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a cloud with net positive charge.|$|R
2500|$|Spread over a hillside, {{the complex}} <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by cedar trees, some [...] tall and {{as old as}} the temple. It <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by bright green moss-covered boulders, and Japanese maples that turn red and gold during autumn.|$|R
50|$|The Justizwache corps badge {{shows the}} Austrian coat of arms, which <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a {{circular}} enclosure. It thus deviates only marginally from the corps badge of the Federal Police, {{in which the}} Bundeswappen <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by an oak leaf wreath.|$|R
5|$|At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien {{inhabitant}} of the Moon, {{named after}} one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they <b>are</b> <b>surrounded.</b> The Selenites capture the astronomers and take them to the palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century {{scientists}} had come to believe that cells <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a thin oil-like barrier, but the structural nature of this membrane was not known. Two experiments in 1925 laid the groundwork to fill in this gap. By measuring the capacitance of erythrocyte solutions, Hugo Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3nm thick.|$|E
5|$|Bynesian decay usually starts when {{specimens}} {{are stored}} or displayed for considerable {{periods of time}} in an enclosed space. The storage method itself usually causes this problem, when containers, cabinets or display cases are entirely or partially made of wood, plywood or other wood products such as Masonite, or when the specimens <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by, or in contact with, various other kinds of materials that are cellulose-based and can turn water vapor acidic.|$|E

5|$|Chicks hatch within 24 {{hours of}} each other. Six days after hatching, the chicks' eyes have opened and after eight days they {{are covered in}} whitish down. Chicks defecate outside of the nest by raising their tail {{to the side of}} the nest, so nests with older chicks <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by faecal matter. Both parents feed and brood the chicks, taking it in turns. When one parent returns with food, it takes over {{brooding}} duties while the other leaves to hunt.|$|E
5|$|It {{is part of}} the Thanet {{district}} and forms part of the civil parish of Birchington. It lies on the coast facing the North Sea, east of the Thames Estuary, between the seaside resorts of Herne Bay and Margate. As a seaside resort, the village is a tourist and retirement destination. The village's Minnis Bay is a family beach with attractions such as sailing, windsurfing, a paddling pool and coastal walking routes. Its three smaller beaches <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by chalk cliffs, cliff stacks and caves.|$|E
5|$|Messers Run is {{flanked by}} areas prone to {{flooding}} during a 100 year flood {{from the mouth of}} Negro Hollow upstream to its headwaters.
