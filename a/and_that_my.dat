When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to him that I was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E

The match {{took place at}} their substitute stadium Upton Park in November 1992 and Primus was awarded man of the match for his performance. Primus played the next two matches against Leicester City and Brentford but was disappointed with his performances. Primus made two further first team appearances in the 1992–93 season but soon found himself lower in the pecking order after other players returned from injury and Primus got injured.

[...] Under pressure from state party officials, she {{dropped out of the}} race on December 21, 2005, to run for New York State Attorney General instead, leaving the Republicans without a well-known candidate. [...] The announcement was timed to coincide with the 2005 New York City transit strike, so as to draw minimal attention to the Republicans' difficulties. [...] Pirro did not mention her campaign woes, but instead said, [...] "I have concluded that my head and my heart remain in law enforcement, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> public service should continue to be in that arena." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dismayed to {{find that}} {{groundbreaking}} work had already been undertaken by Helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds {{by means of a}} similar tuning fork [...] "contraption", Bell pored over the German scientist's book. Working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a French edition, Bell fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, reporting: [...] "Without knowing much about the subject, {{it seemed to me that}} if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means, so could consonants, so could articulate speech." [...] He also later remarked: [...] "I thought that Helmholtz had done it... <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity. It was a valuable blunder...

[...] "I also confess to being somewhat bemused and surprised," [...] he added, [...] "that a book about a New England icon toward whom both Mr. Warren and Mr. Brooks felt distinctly ambivalent would be honored in their name, especially considering that only one of its seven chapters is exclusively devoted to Emerson's accomplishment as a creative writer. So for that particular book to be awarded this prize in particular seems deliciously ironic." [...] Buell added, [...] "On the other hand, Emerson always aspired to be a poet first and foremost, and it's no less true that Brooks and Warren were my own first and foremost instructors {{in the art of}} reading literary texts. I take the judge's verdict as heartening evidence that Emerson did not aspire in vain, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> early training somehow managed to stick." ...|$|E

Credited under the stage name [...] "Arnold Strong", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production. His second film appearance was as a deaf-mute mob hitman in The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he was awarded a Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: [...] "It was very difficult for me in the beginning– I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 1868 the Ottoman {{government}} further banished Bahá'u'lláh and {{his family}} to the prison-city of Acre, then part of the Syrian segment of the Ottoman Empire. As a young woman of twenty-one, Bahíyyih Khánum entered into Acre as a prisoner. This was her fourth place of exile, and her last. Despite her beauty and suitors — she was still determined to remain unmarried, and her father seemed to have advocated this. She was later respected for her choice. When arrived on the bay of Acre, the exiles were disorientated and demoralized. The populace spoke Arabic, which Bahíyyih Khánum understood, and she overheard them mocking and jeering how the family were to be thrown into the sea or imprisoned in chains. She later explained the impact this had on her: [...] "imagine, if you can, the overpowering impression made by all this upon {{the mind of a}} young girl, such as I was then. Can you wonder that I am serious, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> life is different from those of my countrywomen?".|$|E

In the book, Lee {{stated that}} Singaporean Muslims faced {{difficulties}} in integrating {{because of their}} religion, and urged them to [...] "be less strict on Islamic observances". His remarks drew firestorm from Malay/Muslim leaders and MPs in Singapore, prompting a strong reaction from his son Lee Hsien Loong, who's the current Prime Minister at that time as saying [...] "My views on Muslims’ integration in Singapore differed from the Minister Mentor's. Muslims are a valued and respected community, who have done a good deal to strengthen our harmony and social cohesion." [...] Lee Kuan Yew then told the media [...] "I made this one comment on the Muslims integrating with other communities probably {{two or three years}} ago. Ministers and MPs, both Malay and non-Malay, have since told me that Singapore Malays have indeed made special efforts to integrate with the other communities, especially since 9/11, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> call is out of date."

Yes, but only if a light shines on it from above." [...] His close friend Norman Malcolm would write, [...] "Wittgenstein’s mature life was strongly marked by religious thought and feeling. I am inclined to think that he was more deeply religious than are many people who correctly regard themselves as religious believers." [...] At last, Wittgenstein writes, [...] "Bach wrote on the title page of his Orgelbuechlein, ‘To the glory of the most high God, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> neighbour may be benefited thereby.’ [...] That is what I would have liked to say about my work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most Bond {{girls are}} {{apparently}} (and sometimes expressly) sexually {{experienced by the}} time they meet Bond. Quite often those previous experiences have not been positive, and many Bond girls have had sexual violence inflicted on them in the past which has caused them to feel alienated from all men—until Bond comes along. Tiffany Case was gang-raped as a teenager; Honey Ryder, too, was beaten and raped as a teenager by a drunken acquaintance. Pussy Galore was sexually abused at age 12 by her uncle. While there is no such clear-cut trauma in Solitaire's early life, there are suggestions that she, too, avoids men because of their unwanted sexual advances in her past. Kissy Suzuki reports to Bond that during her brief career in Hollywood, when she was 17, [...] "They thought that because I am Japanese I am some sort of an animal <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> body is for everyone." [...] The implication is often that these violent episodes have turned the Bond girls in question against men, though upon encountering Bond they overcome their earlier antipathy and sleep with him not only willingly but eagerly. The cliché reaches its most extreme (perhaps absurd) level in Goldfinger. In this novel Pussy Galore is portrayed as a practising lesbian when she first meets Bond, {{but at the end of}} the novel she sleeps with him. When, in bed, he says to her, [...] "They told me you only liked women," [...] she replies, [...] "I never met a man before." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{expanded}} {{portion of}} the ode {{is related to the}} ideas expressed in Wordsworth's The Prelude Book V in their emphasis on childhood memories and a connection between the divine and humanity. To Wordsworth, the soul was created by the divine and was able to recognise the light in the world. As a person ages, they are no longer able to see the light, but they can still recognise the beauty in the world. He elaborated on this belief in a note to the text: [...] "Archimedes said that he could move the world if he had a point whereon to rest his machine. Who has not felt the same aspirations as regards the world of his own mind? Having to wield some of its elements when I was impelled to write this poem on the [...] "Immortality of the Soul", I took hold of the notion of pre-existence as having sufficient foundation in humanity for authorising me to make for my purpose the best use I could of it as a Poet." [...] This [...] "notion of pre-existence" [...] is somewhat Platonic in nature, and it is the basis for Wordsworth believing that children are able to be the [...] "best philosopher". The idea was not intended as a type of , the reincarnation of the soul from person to person, and Wordsworth later explained that the poem was not meant to be regarded as a complete philosophical view: [...] "In my Ode... I do not profess to give a literal representation {{of the state of the}} affections and of the moral being in childhood. I record my feelings at that time,--my absolute spirituality, my 'all-soulness,' if I may so speak. At that time I could not believe that I should lie down quietly in the grave, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> body would moulder into dust." ...|$|E
