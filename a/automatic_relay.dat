5000|$|Link 16 {{supports}} a single UHF network. Since UHF is a line-of-sight- (LOS-) only band, Link 16 units may require airborne relay support. Link 22 operates on both HF and HF/UHF with <b>automatic</b> <b>relay</b> features {{to reduce the}} need for airborne relay units.|$|E
50|$|Coverage {{beyond what}} the media itself is capable of is {{provided}} by the <b>automatic</b> <b>relay</b> of messages and the ability to adapt to changes automatically, without operator intervention. This removes the need for dedicated air relay platforms and relay slot planning and management. A unit will automatically retransmit a received message when necessary to ensure that the message is received by its addressees. The System Network Controller (SNC) calculates whether the relay is necessary, based on its knowledge of the connectivity among units. The ability of a unit to relay can be affected by its relay setting. This setting’s default is <b>automatic</b> <b>relay,</b> but the unit can be disabled from performing relay or designated as a preferred relayer. Relay is performed on a per message basis. Because messages are retransmitted only when necessary, this reduces the use of bandwidth.|$|E

She and Mr. Booth worked on the same team. He built the computers and she programmed them. This was considered a remarkable achievement due {{to the size of the}} group and the limited funds at its disposal. Although APE(X)C eventually led to the HEC series manufactured by the British Tabulating Machine Company, the small scale of the Birkbeck group did not place it in the front rank of British computer activity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Maintaining link {{connectivity}} {{between a}} mobile robot and its control station in a non-line-of-sight environment is challenging. One {{solution is to}} use intermediate relay radios that the robot can carry and deploy when and where needed to maintain the link. However, the precise placement locations for the relays are not known ahead of time. Therefore, the deployment decision must be formulated online and the relays deployed before the link with the control station breaks. A link-quality estimator is developed based on video throughput and received signal strength indicator data. The estimator takes into account human perception of video quality that is obtained via subjective testing by an operator. The data is used to train the link-quality estimator, which issues an alert {{that can be used}} as a trigger for an <b>automatic</b> <b>relay</b> deployment mechanism or to advise the operator to manually deploy relays before the link between the robot and control station fails. ...|$|E
40|$|One way for Deaf {{people to}} {{communicate}} with hearing people over the telephone {{is to use a}} voice relay. The service is often provided with a human relay operator that relays text into voice, and vice versa, on behalf of the Deaf and hearing users. In developed countries, voice relay is frequently subsidised by governments or service providers. There is no such service in South Africa. We have built several <b>automatic</b> voice <b>relay</b> systems for a disadvantaged Deaf community in Cape Town.

40|$|A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET), {{with its}} {{inherent}} dynamic and flexible architecture, demonstratesattractive potential for military applications. It {{is able to}} overcome traditional communications limitationsthrough its <b>automatic</b> <b>relaying</b> and self-healing/forming features. MANET nodes perform the routingfunctions themselves. Due to the limited wireless transmission range, the routing generally consists ofmultiple hops. Therefore, the nodes depend on one another to forward packets to the destinations. In aMobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), temporary link failures and route changes happen frequently. With theassumption that all packet losses are due to congestion, Transport Control Protocol (TCP) performs poorlyin such an environment. One problem of TCP in such environments is its inability to distinguish lossesinduced by the lossy wireless channel from the ones due to network congestion. Many TCP variants havebeen developed for the improved performance of TCP in MANET. In this research, through simulationsthat were carried out by using Network Simulator- 2 (NS- 2), the selected MANET Routing protocols i. e.

50|$|The {{electrical}} resistance {{of a power}} line causes it to produce more heat as the current it carries increases. If this heat is not sufficiently dissipated, the metal conductor in the line may soften such that it sags under its own weight between supporting structures. If the line sags too low, a flash over to nearby objects (such as trees) may occur, causing a transient increase in current. <b>Automatic</b> protective <b>relays</b> detect the excessively high current and quickly disconnect the line, with the load previously carried by the line transferred to other lines. If the other lines {{do not have enough}} spare capacity to accommodate the extra current, their overload protection will react as well, causing a cascading failure.|$|R
