50|$|Task-based {{language}} learning (TBLL) has been commonly applied to virtual world language education. Task-based {{language learning}} {{focuses on the}} use of <b>authentic</b> <b>language</b> and encourages students to do real life tasks using the language being learned. Tasks can be highly transactional, where the student is carrying out everyday tasks such as visiting the doctor at the Chinese Island of Monash University in Second Life.

Assessment is primarily based on task outcome (in other words the appropriate completion of real world tasks) rather than on accuracy of prescribed language forms. This makes TBLT especially popular for developing target language fluency and student confidence. As such TBLT can be considered a branch of communicative {{language teaching}} (CLT).|$|E

Two years later, he offered the script to Judith Malina and Julian Beck of the Living Theatre. Malina directed the production, Beck designed it, while Gelber was part of casting, directing rehearsals, and selling tickets. Opening in July 1959, the play quickly attracted controversy. Several theatre critics, particularly those writing for the daily newspapers, objected to the play's graphic depiction of heroin addiction and its performance style. The play also attracted prominent supporters, such as the drama critics Kenneth Tynan and Henry Hewes, the poet Allen Ginsberg, the writer Norman Mailer, director Harold Clurman, and Jerry Tallmer, who lauded what they perceived as its innovative style, <b>authentic</b> <b>language,</b> and realism.|$|E
50|$|Oswaldo Vigas {{was born}} in Valencia, Venezuela in 1923. Predominantly {{recognized}} as a self-taught painter, he also worked in architectural murals, sculptures, ceramics, prints and drawings. Vigas is one of Venezuela’s best-known painters and a seminal figure that validated the cultural heritage of the Americas, affirming the importance of revising his own Latin American roots along with a global perspective in the arts. From a very young age, Vigas had already begun showcasing his paintings and illustrations and had participated in several painting salons and exhibitions. He graduated from the School of Medicine in 1951, although he never practiced. He devoted himself exclusively to his artistic career {{for the rest of}} his life. While studying, he continued painting and took several art classes at the Taller Libre de Artes, and attended the Escuela de Artes Plásticas Cristóbal Rojas, where he became acquainted with painters like Manuel Cabré and Pedro Ángel González, among others. His early paintings focus on the human figure - mostly a female figure - pre-announcing the theme that would remain a constant throughout his career: the witches. His works became quite gestural and he took an interest in pre-Columbian cultures and pottery. Progressively, he departed from conventional depictions as his line became visceral and concerned with pre-Columbian representation, which would mark a milestone in his works. In 1952 he received the National Visual Arts Award and had a major solo exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Caracas. In 1952 he relocated to Paris, where he lived for twelve years and met Janine, his lifelong companion. He studied engraving and lithography at the École des Beaux-Arts and took open courses at the Sorbonne. While in Paris, he was commissioned to produce five mosaic murals that were to become part of the Universidad Central de Venezuela, declared a World Heritage Cultural Site by UNESCO in 2000, a great example of the total integration of art and architecture, conceived by Architect Carlos Raúl Villanueva que el artista realizó en París., with the participation of national and international artists such as Jean Arp, Alexander Calder, Wifredo Lam, Fernand Léger, Mateo Manaure, Alejandro Otero, Víctor Valera, and Victor Vasarely, among others. During most of the 1950s, his works shifted away from the human figure towards constructivism and abstraction. In 1953, he participated in the I São Paulo Biennial and in a group show at the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, among other exhibitions. Between 1953 and 1958, the artist exhibited regularly in France and Venezuela. In 1954, he represented Venezuela at the XXVII Venice Biennale, and was part of the Painters of Venezuela traveling exhibition at the Pan-American Union, sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C. During the late 1950s to mid 1960s, while still living in France, Vigas was invited to participate at an important survey about Latin American art in which he was awarded first prize: the Gulf-Caribbean Art Exhibition, curated by Lee Malone at The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. This exhibition traveled later to the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts, The institute of Contemporary Art, Boston; The Munson-Williams Proctor Institute, Utica, The Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, and the Colorado Springs Fine Art Center. Also, he had exhibitions at the Slater Memorial Museum of Norwich, Connecticut and the University of Nebraska Art Gallery, and participated in the Contemporary Drawings from Latin America show at the Pan-American Union in Washington, D.C. He was included in another large survey exhibition, South American Art Today, curated by José Gómez Sicre at the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts. Well versed in anthropology and primitive cultures, influenced by a visit to Picasso in 1955, Vigas channeled his works of the 1950s into a search for an <b>authentic</b> <b>language,</b> combining gestural, geometric and figurative paintings that led him progressively to reveal his connection with early cultures, and for the notion of a personal identity marked by telluric, magical and personal imaginative resources found in his works from the 1960s onward. In 1964 he moved back to Valencia, Venezuela, along with Janine, his French wife and life companion, and continued to exhibit his work thoroughly throughout the country. In 1967, his son Lorenzo was born, and in 1970, he relocated to Caracas.|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{purpose of}} this article is to assess how {{multilingualism}} affects judicial interpretation of EU law. In the EU, the European Court of Justice is in the position of having the ﬁnal say on what EU norms mean. Therefore, the article looks into the case law of that Court. It is well known that all ofﬁcial EU languages (23 of them at present) are <b>authentic</b> <b>languages.</b> Less known is what the related consequences are for interpretation in judicial proceedings. The ﬁrst aim of the article is to ﬁnd out what consequences the ECJ has drawn from this fact. Secondly, even though in some cases (eg CILFIT) the ECJ has postulated language comparison as a necessary step in construing the meaning of EU law, it is clear that such comparisons are not performed on a regular basis. Therefore, the article looks into when, on whose initiative, and for what purpose the Court performs a comparison of the same EU norm(s) expressed in different languages. The article then looks into what the Court does if discrepancies in different language versions are found, and concludes that such a problem is overcome by looking for the purpose of a legal norm. Finally, it is found that multilingualism does not signiﬁcantly affect the manner and outcome of interpretation by the ECJ...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{explosion}} in technology, {{in particular in}} computer and digitizing systems, has many implications for heritage language maintenance and learning. In particular, <b>authentic</b> <b>language</b> usage can be easily recorded and preserved for those goals. That same explosion, however, {{can lead to a}} less than appropriate implementation of technology for language maintenance and learning. Further, certain cultural boundaries can make it difficult to have access to <b>authentic</b> <b>language</b> usage, particularly by out-group individuals who work on indigenous languages. This paper presents a pilot study that attempts to both implement technology in an appropriate manner and surmount the problems faced by out-group language researchers by training an in-group member, in this case a speaker of Navajo, in the methodology and technology necessary for recording and preserving her heritage language. The results of this work are discussed, as well as the role of computer and digitizing technology in language maintenance and teaching. ...|$|E

40|$|It seems {{possible}} to evaluate language proficiency as behavioral ability by: (1) observing <b>authentic</b> <b>language</b> behavior, (2) examining the tacit knowledge that underlies language: behavior or testing specific tasks based on capabilities that {{are linked to}} implicit knowledge of a language, and (3) testing the acquired explicit knowledge, such as use of grammatical rules. A test was administered to foreign nationals in the Netherlands who were applying to teach their native languages and cultures to preschoolers. The test, intended to measure the first two factors, consisted of an oral proficiency test of <b>authentic</b> <b>language</b> behavior, a standard multiple-choice test, a multiple-choice test of orthography and morphology, and a cloze test. Analysis of the data found similar results for measurement of language proficiency by evaluating language behavior and by testing implicit knowledge.
