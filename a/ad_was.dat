50|$|The {{trick of}} {{effective}} <b>ads</b> <b>is</b> {{to make them}} less like banner <b>ads.</b> Native <b>ads</b> <b>are</b> <b>ads</b> that <b>are</b> delivered within the online feed content. For example, short video ads played between episodes of a series, text ads in social feeds, graphic ads within mobile apps. The idea <b>is</b> the <b>ads</b> <b>are</b> designed {{as a part of}} general experiences in order to not move the user away from his task. Native <b>ads</b> <b>are</b> better in gaining attention and engagement than traditional ads. In experiment conducted by infolinks, integrated native <b>ads</b> <b>were</b> seen 47% faster than banner ads and these areas had 451% more fixations than banner ads. Also time spent by a user was 4000% more, which leads to better recall. Native <b>ads</b> <b>are</b> consumed {{the same way as the}} web content. Viewability can be defined as measure of whether an <b>ad</b> <b>is</b> visible on a site. Location and placement of an ad affects the viewabilty. Native advertisements have better viewability because they are better integrated with the website and have useful formats for customers. That’s one of the reasons why in-image ads have gained popularity. They are generally found in prime locations laid on top of website images which make them highly visible.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAlthough Alzheimer's disease (<b>AD)</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} common {{neurodegenerative}} disease, the etiology of <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> not well understood. In some cases, genetic factors explain AD risk, but {{a high percentage of}} late-onset <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> unexplained. The fact that <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> associated with a number of physical and systemic manifestations suggests that <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> a multifactorial disease that affects both the CNS and periphery. Interestingly, a common feature of many systemic processes linked to <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> involvement in energy metabolism. The goals of this review are to 1) explore the evidence that peripheral processes contribute to AD risk, 2) explore ways that AD modulates whole-body changes, and 3) discuss the role of genetics, mitochondria, and vascular mechanisms as underlying factors that could mediate both central and peripheral manifestations of AD. Despite efforts to strictly define AD as a homogeneous CNS disease, there may be no single etiologic pathway leading to the syndrome of AD dementia. Rather, the neurodegenerative process may involve some degree of baseline genetic risk that is modified by external risk factors. Continued research into the diverse but related processes linked to <b>AD</b> risk <b>is</b> necessary for successful development of disease-modifying therapies...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (<b>AD)</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} common form of dementia, with a {{prevalence}} that increases with age. By 2050, the worldwide number of patients with <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> projected to reach more than 140 million. The prominent signs of <b>AD</b> <b>are</b> progressive memory loss, accompanied by a gradual decline in cognitive function and premature death. <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> the clinical manifestation of altered proteostasis. The initiating step of altered proteostasis in most <b>AD</b> patients <b>is</b> not known. The progression of <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> accelerated by several chronic disorders, among which the contribution of diabetes to <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> well understood at the cell biology level. The pathological mechanisms of AD and diabetes interact and tend to reinforce each other, thus accelerating cognitive impairment. At present, only symptomatic interventions are available for treating AD. To optimise symptomatic treatment, a personalised therapy approach has been suggested. Intranasal insulin administration seems to open the possibility for a safe, and at least in the short term, effective symptomatic intervention that delays loss of cognition in AD patients. This review summarizes the interactions of AD and diabetes from the cell biology to the patient level and the clinical results of intranasal insulin treatment of cognitive decline in AD...|$|R

In Confessions, Augustine wrote that his previous work was dominated by materialism and that reading Plato's works enabled him to consider {{the existence of a}} non-physical substance. This helped him develop a response to the problem of evil from a theological (and non-Manichean) perspective, based on his interpretation of the first few chapters of Genesis and the writings of Paul the Apostle.

5|$|Blokumannaland is a {{territory}} mentioned in Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla ("The Circle of the World") from the 13th century. The book narrates how the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, {{referred to by}} the name Kirjalax, invaded Blokumannaland where he fought against pagan tribes. Since these pagans have not been identified, there is disagreement as to the actual date of the Byzantine invasion. For instance, Spinei identifies the events prescribed in the Heimskringla with the Battle of Levounion of 1091 AD, which ended with the catastrophic defeat of the Pechenegs by the Byzantines. He argues that Blokumannaland refers to {{a territory}} inhabited by Vlachs south of the Lower Danube. On the other hand, Sandaaker proposes that the battle took place in 1040 AD, while the latest date of 1122 <b>AD</b> <b>was</b> proposed by Ellis Davidson and Blöndal. Alexandru Madgearu says that Sturluson anachronistically mentioned the lands south of the Danube as Blokummanaland, because the latter term referred to the Second Bulgarian Empire in Sturluson's time.
