With Street now producing the album, Blur recorded a mix of material spanning both the period immediately {{after the release of}} Leisure and their 1992 tour. While the band members were pleased with the recording session results, Balfe, after hearing the songs, told the band they were committing artistic suicide. Although dejected by his response, Blur gave Food the completed album in December 1992. However, the label told the group that the album was unfit for release <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> least they should add a few more potential singles.

500|$|By {{the early}} 1600s, the average Paraguayan despised the Jesuits. [...] Some {{agitated}} {{for the government}} to take action against them, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> least the idea of extending further [...] "privileges" [...] was out of the question. [...] A series of intrigues took place from 1640-1650 with pro-Jesuit governor Gregorio de Hinestrosa vying against the anti-Jesuit Bishop Bernardino de Cárdenas, a Franciscan. [...] Cárdenas was exiled to Corrientes, but upon the end of Hinestrosa's governorship returned to Asunción. [...] The new governor Diego de Escobar y Osorio attempted to remain neutral in the conflict between the Jesuits and the settlers who were now backed by the returned Cárdenas, and successfully avoided bloodshed for a time, but in 1649 Osorio died. [...] The cabildo, seizing on the Decree of 1537, promptly elected Cárdenas the new governor, and with his support expelled the Jesuits from their college in Asunción. [...] They wrote in explanation of their actions that the Jesuits were destroying the province, and it was the [...] "natural right" [...] of people to defend themselves against aggression. [...] Governor-Bishop Cárdenas, in similar proto-democratic language, said [...] "the voice of the People is the voice of God." [...] The authorities were displeased, and the Jesuits, with the government's permission, sent in an army of mission Indians to depose Cárdenas. [...] Cárdenas and the Paraguayan militia decided to resist, and in a battle on October 5, 1649, the Jesuit army of roughly 700 Indians won a complete victory. [...] The Paraguayans were scattered, Cárdenas and his closest supporters were arrested, and the citizens of Asunción were subjected to the humiliation of an occupying army of Indians patrolling their streets and enforcing the new governor's rule. [...] This wound never healed. [...] By 1721, hatred of the Jesuits was even more intense {{than it was in the}} early 1600s.|$|E
