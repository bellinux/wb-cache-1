40|$|The {{second edition}} of the International Standard Archival <b>Authority</b> <b>Records</b> for Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (ISAAR(CPF) 2) focuses on {{describing}} entities as they exist in reality, rather than on establishing authorized terms. This change allows <b>authority</b> <b>records</b> to include multiple authorized terms representing an entity as it changed over time. Traditionally, an <b>authority</b> <b>record</b> has been created for a corporate body each time its name changed.
