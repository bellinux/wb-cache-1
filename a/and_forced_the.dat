5|$|After the Roman {{victory at}} Mount Olympus, the Tectosagi begged {{them not to}} attack them and asked to meet him for a conference halfway between their camp and Ancyra. The main aim of the conference was for the Tectosagi to delay the Roman attack {{so that they could}} allow the women and {{children}} to retreat across the Halys River. Their other aim was to assassinate Manlius while he was at the conference. While they were going to the conference the Romans saw the Galatian cavalry charging at them. In the skirmish that followed the Galatians overpowered Manlius' bodyguard due to their numbers but were driven back when the escort that had been accompanying the Roman foragers arrived <b>and</b> <b>forced</b> <b>the</b> Galatians to retreat.|$|E

The pharaoh was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute. The Hyksos ("foreign rulers") retained Egyptian models of government and identified as pharaohs, thus integrating Egyptian elements into their culture. They and other invaders introduced new tools of warfare into Egypt, most notably the composite bow and the horse-drawn chariot.|$|E
