40|$|Lookahead is a {{key issue}} in {{distributed}} discrete event simulation. It becomes explicit in conservative simulation algorithms, where the two major approaches are the asynchronous null-message (CMB) algorithms and the synchronous window algorithms (CTW). In this paper we demonstrate a CMBbased algorithm that maximises the lookahead capabilities of a model, by lookahead accumulation. Furthermore, per processor aggregation of the logical processes allows for tuning of the granularity. A qualitative performance analysis shows that in case of no hop-models our algorithm outperforms the traditional conservative algorithms CMB & CTW. This is due to reduced synchronisation overhead caused by longer independent computation cycles, generated by the lookahead accumulation <b>accros</b> the shortest lookahead path...|$|E

40|$|In {{this era}} {{shopping}} centre {{has become one}} of favorite place to come, the well known one is Mall. In the early of 1990 ’s. Great number of shopping centres that combine with entertainment centres are being built <b>accros</b> the country. In Semarang many investor built malls bring a concept of enclosed mall. It has character building wich covered and air conditioned, usually known as EMAC (Enclosed Mall Air conditioned). The problem of enclosed mall was appear, it comsumed a lot of energy for its air conditioner and the building make a single and strong architectural statement that leads to capitalism. In this chosen site, located around residential area of BSB City Semarang and close to a lake which point interest of BSB City’ central developement area. Looked at in that terms, it is important to design a shopping centre that intergrate a festive shopping atmosphere and recreation. So appear the idea to design semi-street mall, a combination of enclosed mall and a native street mall. A basic design goal for semi-street mall is to bring about a festive and colorful environment; to create a marketplace that would make shopping a gayer, more interesting experience set in sprightly, good-nature, attractive surrounding and regenerate pedestrian to walk from node to another nodes...|$|E
40|$|Route {{planning}} {{is the process}} of determining a route, or path, from some location to another. The route may be described by a line on a map, a sequence of movements (e. g., “Turn right, walk forward, turn left at the next intersection”), or a sequence of way-points (e. g., “Go to the corner of Snelling and Grand”, “Next go to the corner of Grand and Pascal”, “Last go to 1430 Grand Avenue”). Humans are generally very good at figuring out routes from one place to another, whether within a building, around a campus, across a city, or <b>accros</b> the country. We can take into account any number of intangible or qualitative factors in determining a route. In fact, you’ve probably seen or been a part of an argument about what the “best ” route is to some goal location. Computer systems that generate route plans are used for providing directions to humans, arranging com-plicated travel plans (like connections between transit options), or providing routes to control the movement of robots, whether simulated or real. Most of us are familiar with web sites such as Google Maps that can generate driving directions. You may also have used a transit system route planner; I once planned a train trip in Europe, changing trains included, from the comfort of my office! Relevant links...|$|E
40|$|Since {{last two}} decades we notice an {{intensive}} growth of the pilgrimage movement along the Way os St. James. This route connecting furthests places in Europe and ending in Santiago de Compostela {{is based on a}} medieval transportation route called The Royal Route – Via Regia. The route exists for over 1000 years and is constantly developed thanks to actions taken by the authorities of the Catholic Church, governments and non-government organizations, as well as numerous enthusiastics of the Way of St. James. Since 1987, when the Council of Europe declared the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela the first European Cultural Route we notice re-creation of former pilgrimage routes <b>accros</b> all european countries. The Way of St. James, marked on its whole lenght with the motif of the scallop shell, leads from Poland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Italy and ends in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Spain at the tomb of St. James the Apostle. It is estimated that over 5 million people a year visit the sanctuary of St. James in Santiago de Compostela. Since the early ' 80 s the Pilgrims' Office of Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela analyze the pilgrimage movement to the tomb of St. James. Basing on its research we should pointed out that vast majority of pilgrims who received the "Compostela" in 2010 (document confirming the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela) came on foot. There are also pilgrims coming to the tomb of the first marthyr by bike, on horseback or even in a wheelchair. Although the Spanish are still the largest group of pilgrims, the Pilgrims' Office noticed a significant growth of foreign pilgrims. People undertake the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela for various reasons: pure religious, cultural-religious or cultural motives. Currently, there is more than 3200 km of Camino de Santiago in Poland and they are divided into 16 sections. Polish part of the route meets Via Regia in Germany in Görlitz. The opening of the Way of St. James Via Regia from Korczowa (located on Polish-Ukrainian border) - hopefully will become a strong impulse to develop religious tourism on the medieval route to Kiev.
