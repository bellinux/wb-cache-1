500|$|The {{relationship}} between both managers was evidently hostile to begin with. Ferguson noted that Wenger {{was the only}} manager he came across in the league not to share a drink with after matches – an English football [...] "tradition". In a joint interview with The Times and Daily Mail in 2009, Wenger said his discourtesy was mistaken for mistrust and managers [...] "cannot be completely friendly and open up." [...] When asked {{if this was the}} reason he avoided the post-match drink, he replied: [...] "Most of the time, yes. What can you say if you have won? And if you have lost <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do is get home and prepare for the next game." ...|$|E
500|$|Abrams {{asked her}} {{to play the role}} because he had seen her {{previous}} work and liked it. Saldana had never seen the original series, though she had played a Trekkie in The Terminal (2004), but agreed to play the role after Abrams complimented her. [...] "For an actor, that's all you need, that's <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> <b>To</b> get the acknowledgment and respect from your peers," [...] she said. She met with Nichelle Nichols, who explained to her how she had created Uhura's background and had named the character. Saldana's mother was a Star Trek fan and sent her voice mails during filming, giving advice on the part. Sydney Tamiia Poitier also auditioned for the part. The film officially establishes the character's first name, which had never been previously uttered on TV or in film. It also establishes (in an officially discreet manner) that Uhura and Spock are, in fact, lovers and had been romantically linked for some time during the film.|$|E
500|$|The band {{said that}} while {{producing}} the song, they attempted to find out [...] "how to make dance music" [...] without turning themselves into a dance act. Armstrong {{said it was the}} first time the band had written a dance song. Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound compared the song with the works of The Rapture and The Clash's 1982 album, Combat Rock; he said it was [...] "strictly for basement dancefloors everywhere". According to Armstrong, the lyrics of [...] "Kill the DJ" [...] can be considered as [...] "a sweeping political statement" [...] rather than being interpreted as [...] "a comment on electronic music figures". He told Rolling Stone the song is about [...] "static and noise...Like this government cannot, will not, agree with itself. They refuse to make it work. Right, left—it doesn’t matter. It blows your mind and pisses you off. It’s a song about being drunk, going through this chaos, feeling fucked up and <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do is get more drunk".|$|E

500|$|Although its {{gameplay}} {{was mainly}} well received, the game's long loading times were criticised. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb noted Wipeout 2048 technical issues, particularly its loading times. IGN's Cam Shea called the 30-second loading times frustrating [...] "when <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do is race", and Gameplanet's Adam Goodall also described the long loading times as awful, though he {{felt they were}} {{not enough to make}} the game a failure and assured the overall gameplay experience [...] "deeply satisfying". GamesRadar's Kathryn Bailey said that the game's online mode was well-executed, highly accessible and a [...] "credit to Wipeout." [...] She said that its user interface appeared clean and shiny, and called the touchscreen-based menu system [...] "a pleasure to behold". The Guardian Simon Parkin criticised the game's protracted loading times; a pause at least twenty seconds too long had a negative effect in the era of [...] "insta-fix mobile gaming on the rival platforms". Willington found the lengthy load times an issue which plagues the game, [...] "totally at odds" [...] with the normal pace of gameplay. Gaston said that the loading times were [...] "simply unforgivable"; he routinely waited over 50 seconds after selecting a race to start it, which minimised the ability to comfortably play the game [...] "on the go". Walton also found the long loading times infuriating in a handheld game, and said that having to wait more than 40 seconds to start a race was far longer than it should have been. Although Furfari found that the game had one of the longest loading times on the PlayStation Vita, it was not a [...] "deal breaker" [...] and Wipeout 2048 {{was one of the few}} racing titles for the console that he recommended. Although Haley noted the game's substantial loading times, he said that was a common feature in PlayStation Vita launch titles.|$|E
2500|$|Continuing as Test captain, Waugh led {{the team}} to a 2–1 victory in South Africa to retain Australia's ranking as the number one team. Australia crushed the hosts in the First Test by an innings and 360 runs, won the Second Test by four wickets, before losing the last. His own form was poor, with 95 runs at 19.00. He left the tour once the ODI series began. Arriving in Australia alone, he faced media {{questioning}} over his playing future. Waugh's reply was, [...] "We've just beaten the next {{best team in the}} world 5–1, and <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> talk about is getting me out of the team." ...|$|E
