However the President of the Constitutional Council immediately declared that the results were invalid and the next day, in accordance with article 94 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Council declared Gbagbo the winner. Both Gbagbo and Ouattara claimed victory and took the presidential oath of office. The ensuing events led to the 2010-2011 Ivorian crisis.|$|E

Two Irish Catholic laborers, Dominic Daley and James Halligan, were seen near the vicinity of the crime, and apprehended. The case became a huge sensation. The men were given a hasty trial and executed in Northampton in June, 1806, before a crowd of 20,000 cheering spectators.

40|$|In Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, the Supreme Court {{changed the}} rhetoric of the federal {{pleading}} system. Those decisions have been decried by members of the bar, scholars, and legislators as judicial activism and a rewriting of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Such criticism has led members of both houses of Congress to introduce legislation to overrule the decisions and return to some variation of the 2 ̆ 2 notice pleading 2 ̆ 2 regime that existed before Twombly. This Note argues that both of the current proposals to overrule Twombly and Iqbal should be rejected. Although the bills take different approaches to their goal of overruling Twombly and Iqbal, each one would disrupt the careful balance of interests created by the Federal Rules and create intolerable confusion for judges ruling on the often-filed 12 (b) (6) motion to dismiss.

40|$|The unified {{approach}} to {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) as per the Kidney Disease Outcomes Initiative (KDOQI) guideline for the definition and classification of kidney disease provided a paradigm shift in the detection, evaluation, and stratification of what was a neglected clinical problem. The guideline, based on the then-available evidence, determined the problems, limitations, and gaps in {{the knowledge of the}} proposed approach. Since then, solutions to the identified problems have been sought, resolutions are in place or are forthcoming, and longitudinal and cohort studies have been undertaken to better define the epidemiology of the disease and its prognostic determinants. The guideline also fostered considerable debate on the precision of the glomerular filtration rate equations, the implications of mislabeling cases, and the large estimates of prevalent cases of CKD. Winearls and Glassock now propose a new staging of CKD, centered on its progression to end-stage renal disease.

40|$|Effective {{strategic}} management requires analysis, {{decisions and}} actions by an organization {{to create and}} sustain competitive advantage. Gooddecisions are obviously desirable but whether the decision is good is a judgment call, often after the fact, and is itself subject to bias. What is less subject to debate is the process that leads to accuracy or quality decision making.  This requires not just access to available information but proper processing, interpretation and integration of that data.  Critical is the consideration of multiple options and perspectives at all stages {{and there are a}} myriad of reasons why people do not do that.  Defective decisions come from poor information search, selective bias in processing the information, a lack of considering alternatives, a failure to examine the risks of the preferred choice and <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> <b>judgment</b> (Janis and Mann 1977).  In short, the selection, interpretation and integration of information is “biased”.  In this brief overview, we consider “bias” both at the individual and the group level.  The overarching perspective is that there are psychological reasons that constrain and bias thought and there are also psychological antidotes that can improve it.   The former are more numerous and well documented than the latter but in both individual and group decision making, the influences are predictable, pervasive and profound, leading at times to defective decision making and at other times to better and even creative decision making...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze media {{storytelling}} and rhetoric surrounding the credibility of the longstanding accounting practice of mark-to-market valuation. Design/methodology/approach – The cascading storytelling model of progressive framing by the media of mark-to-market valuation was applied to story subsets of the three types of classic Aristotelian rhetorical appeals. Findings – The authors found that the media blamed the accounting profession's mark-to-market valuation practices as substantive cause of recent corporate problems and declines in market values. In addition, the rhetorical framing of mark-to-market accounting practices in the media prompted the Financial Accounting Standards Board to <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> <b>judgment.</b> Research limitations/implications – The paper is limited to the analysis of the storytelling included. Different results from other sources may provide another result. Practical implications – The failure in the media to address the duality between the logos of accounting and the ethos of the media narratives exacerbated the cascading activation. Understanding this duality may provide a different lens in looking at information dissemination. This is not only relative to stakeholders in making more informed decisions but should also serve as a warning to the profession, to have more voice, to use a rhetorical strategy that can have more saliency in the public arena. Originality/value – The paper examined storytelling as interplay of retrospective narrative, the presentness of living story, and the antenarratives shaping the future of not only the unfolding economic crisis, but the future of accounting itself. In terms of rhetoric, we extended the application of pathos, ethos, and logos by examining a cascading activation theory model. This is one of the few studies of antenarratives and how through cascade rhetoric the future is shaped. Accounting, Marketing, Rhetoric, Storytelling...|$|E
