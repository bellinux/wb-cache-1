25|$|Cutolo openly {{supported}} the young inmates, who were confronted with abuse, brutality, physical aggression and rape. He {{provided them with}} advice and protection from the brutalities of other inmates. At {{the same time they}} learned how to behave as a good picciotto, the lowest entry level into the Camorra. Cutolo challenged the old Camorra bosses and gave the youngsters a structure to belong to: “The new Camorra must have a statute, a structure, an oath, a complete ceremony, a ritual that must excite people {{to the point that they}} would risk their lives for this organization.” Cutolo was revered by his soldiers. They called him Prince <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>his</b> left hand as if he were a bishop.|$|E
25|$|On September 12, 1856, Dominic asked John Bosco {{permission}} to go home, saying {{that his mother was}} ill, though he had received no communication. Dominic's mother was then expecting a baby and was in great pain, and when Dominic reached the house, he hugged <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>his</b> mother, and then left. His mother felt her pain leave her and Dominic's baby sister, Catherine was born. The women assisting at the birth found that Dominic had left a green scapular around his mother's neck. His sister Theresa later wore this same scapular when she was in labour. She testified that it had been passed around to several other pregnant women and was later lost.|$|E
25|$|In {{the main}} event, the match between The Undertaker and Roman Reigns was {{revealed}} to be a No Holds Barred match. Jim Ross returned as a guest commentator. During the match, Undertaker performed a chokeslam on an announce table on Reigns, who then performed a spear through another announce table. Undertaker performed a Last Ride for a near-fall. Reigns performed two Superman Punches on Undertaker, who performed a chokeslam on Reigns onto a chair for a near-fall. Undertaker performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Reigns for a near-fall. Reigns executed another spear but Undertaker applied Hell's Gate, with Reigns managing to escape. Reigns attacked Undertaker with a chair, and performed two spears - both scored near-falls. Undertaker attempted his signature sit-up, but suddenly collapsed. After another spear, Reigns pinned Undertaker to win the match and become the second person to defeat Undertaker at WrestleMania, after Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania XXX. After the match, The Undertaker symbolically left his gloves, coat, and hat {{in the center of}} the ring, hinting that this was possibly his last match. In a very rare moment, Undertaker broke character <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>his</b> wife, Michelle McCool, who was seated in the front row. Undertaker walked to the center of the entrance ramp, looked at the crowd and raised his arm as he was lowered below the stage to the sound of his music and his signature gong sounded three times as the show ended. In the arena, the main stage lighting (not the crowd's lighting) was left off for the remainder of the evening, and Undertaker's clothes were left in the ring as the production crew cleaned up, only taking his clothing articles when it was time to disassemble the ring.|$|E

500|$|From their {{advantageous}} height by Königgrätz, the Austrians frequently bombarded the Prussian army encamped below them. On {{the same}} day that Frederick's doctors bled him, an Austrian cannonade grew so strong that Frederick rode out to observe the damage. During the ride, his vein opened. A company medic bound his wound, an incident later depicted by the painter Bernhard Rode. In his admiring history of Frederick the Great, the English historian Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) relayed the story of Frederick and a Croatian marksman. As Frederick was reconnoitering, Carlyle maintained, the King encountered the Croat taking aim at him. Reportedly, he wagged his finger at the man, as if to say, [...] "Do not do that." [...] The Croat thought better of shooting the King, and disappeared into the woods; some reports maintain he actually knelt before the king <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>his</b> hand.|$|E
2500|$|Khrushchev {{wrote in}} his memoirs that Beria had, {{immediately}} after Stalin's stroke, gone about [...] "spewing hatred against [...] and mocking him." [...] When Stalin showed signs of consciousness, Beria {{dropped to his knees}} <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>his</b> hand. When Stalin fell unconscious again, Beria immediately stood and spat.|$|E
2500|$|The {{service was}} {{conducted}} by the elderly and infirm Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who would be dead {{before the end of}} the year. He steadfastly refused to delegate any part of his duties and had to be supported throughout by two other bishops. Because of his failing eyesight, the text of the service had to be printed in gigantic type onto rolls of paper called [...] "prompt scrolls"; they are preserved in the Lambeth Palace Library. Archbishop Temple provided most of the upsets in an otherwise splendid ceremony; he was unable to rise after kneeling to pay homage and had to be helped up by the King and several bishops, he placed the crown back-to-front on the King's head, and when a colleague enquired after his well being, he was told to [...] "go away!" [...] in a loud voice that was plainly heard by the congregation. The King also deviated from the order of service; when the Prince of Wales touched the Crown <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>his</b> father's left cheek in the traditional gesture of homage, the King rose to his feet and threw his arms around his son's neck in an unusual display of affection. Because he was still convalescing, Edward had been crowned with the Imperial State Crown instead of the intended St Edward's Crown which is heavier. Alexandra was crowned immediately after her husband by William Dalrymple Maclagan, Archbishop of York. She was crowned with a new crown containing the Koh-i-Noor diamond.|$|E
