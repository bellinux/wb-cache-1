25|$|Harmless and of no {{commercial}} value, the roughtail catshark is {{too small}} to be caught on most types of fishing gear but is taken incidentally in shrimp trawls. Shark expert Stewart Springer reported in 1966 that it was frequently caught in shrimp trawls along the entire coast of Florida. The impact of trawl fisheries on this species in United States waters is unknown; its depth and spawning habitat preferences may offer a degree of protection from fishing pressure. Similarly, shrimp trawling activity off Central <b>America</b> <b>does</b> not extend into the depths occupied by this species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has therefore assessed the roughtail catshark as of Least Concern.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of proliferating buds in ebony spleenwort has also {{given rise to}} a taxonomic treatment. Bud formation was first observed by Conrad Loddiges in 1817, in specimens in cultivation in Great Britain. However, the phenomenon was overlooked until 1879, when D. C. Eaton observed it in specimens from Florida. He took this for an aberrant variety, which he named A.ebeneum var.proliferum. Willard Clute reduced its status from a variety to a form, A.ebeneum f.proliferum, in 1906. Similar specimens were subsequently reported from Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut; the buds appeared on the rachis of sterile fronds, and were often only detected when mounting the specimen. In 1924, Frederick G. Floyd argued that the {{formation of}} these proliferations was a normal characteristic of the species, which appeared regularly, if not universally, and did not warrant a varietal designation. He also observed the formation of proliferating buds on a fertile rachis of A.ebeneum var.serratum. Floyd's position was not universally accepted: Louise Tanger made a new combination for the form, A.platyneuron f.proliferum in 1933, and Taylor et al. recognized it in a discussion of infraspecific taxa in the species in 1976. However, these authors noted that specimens of A.platyneuron f.proliferum would be assigned to various other varieties if they were not proliferous. Wagner & Johnson, in 1981, declined to recognize the taxon on grounds similar to Floyd's, and Wagner's treatment in Flora of North <b>America</b> <b>does</b> not mention the form.|$|E
