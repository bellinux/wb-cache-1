5|$|On Late Registration, West drew {{inspiration}} from English trip hop band Portishead and collaborated with film score composer Jon Brion. The album's music blends West's primary soulful hip hop production with Brion's elaborate chamber pop orchestration, and experimentally delves into {{a wide array of}} different genres, including jazz, blues, rock, R, spoken word, funk, turntablism, western classical, and psychedelic soul. With the presence of Brion, who conducts a twenty-piece orchestra and plays instruments individually selected by West, the album is largely orchestral in nature, brandishing a euphony of string arrangements, piano chords, brass flecks, and horn riffs among other symphonic instrumentation. They also incorporated a myriad of foreign and vintage instruments not typical in popular music, let alone hip hop, such as a celesta, harpsichord, Chamberlin, CS-80 <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizer,</b> Chinese bells and berimbau, vibraphones, and marimba.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{with their}} {{previous}} albums, the group produced Sons of Soul entirely themselves. They utilized both vintage and contemporary recording gear in the album's production, including a Hammond B-3, Clavinet, ARP String Ensemble, and Korg and Roland synthesizers. Riley viewed that hearing music played {{from the older}} instruments affected their songwriting. For his vocals, Raphael recorded with Neumann U87 and AKG C12A condensor microphones, {{as well as a}} vintage RCA Type77-DX microphone. He used a custom five-string bass from a guitar and bass repair shop in San Francisco, as well as a Minimoog <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizer</b> for other bass lines on the album. D'wayne used a Microtech Gefell UM70 for his lead vocals and an AKG 414 for his background vocals. He played a vintage Gibson L6-S and a Fender Coronado guitar, modified with Gibson burst bucker pickups. Aside from his drumming, Riley played both Wurlitzer and Fender Rhodes electric pianos.|$|E
25|$|The Moog {{synthesizer}} is an <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizer</b> {{without the}} use of a vacuum tube. A Moog synthesizer uses analog circuits and analog computer techniques to generate sound electronically. In 1964, Dr. Robert Moog invented the Moog synthesizer that has been used by recording artists such as Mick Jagger, The Beatles, The Monkees, and Stevie Wonder.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizers</b> in the 1920s and 1930s, {{such as the}} Trautonium, {{were built}} {{with a variety of}} vacuum-tube (thermionic valve) and electro-mechanical technologies. After the 1960s, <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizers</b> were built using operational amplifier (op-amp) integrated circuits, and used potentiometers (pots, or variable resistors) to adjust the sound parameters. <b>Analog</b> <b>synthesizers</b> also use low-pass filters and high-pass filters to modify the sound. While 1960s-era <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizers</b> such as the Moog used a number of independent electronic modules connected by patch cables, later <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizers</b> such as the Minimoog integrated them into single units, eliminating patch cords in favour of integrated signal routing systems.|$|R

25|$|The {{limited edition}} package for Era Extraña {{came with the}} Pal198X, a mini <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizer</b> created by Palomo and the company Bleep Labs. With three oscillators, {{including}} two triangle waves and a square low-frequency oscillator, it is {{a modified version of}} the company's synth kit Pico Paso, with the addition of swappable controls. Some releases of the vinyl deluxe edition of Era Extraña also came with a 47-minute untitled mixtape, with only the text Neon Indian Mixtape labeled on the disc. The blog Disco Naïveté said that many of the mixtape tracks could have served as influences for Palomo in making Era Extraña. A 42-date North American tour for Era Extraña was announced on December 6, 2011. It premiered on December 31 at the Lights All Night festival in Dallas, Texas, and ended with a show at New York City's Terminal 5 on May 12, 2012.|$|E
500|$|Much of the band's {{music is}} {{characterized}} by Lytle's <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizer</b> and the fuzzy guitar, bass and drums {{of the rest of}} the band. The band has variously been described as [...] "bittersweet indie space rock", [...] "neo-psychedelic, blissed-out indie rock", [...] "dreamy, spacey psychedelic pop", and [...] "an uneasy combination of warm, tactile guitars and affectless electronics". Jon Pareles of The New York Times described the band's songs as [...] "stately anthems orchestrated with full late-psychedelic pomp: fuzz-toned guitar strumming, rippling keyboards, brawny drumbeats".|$|E
500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, [...] "The Power of Good-Bye" [...] {{begins with a}} four-chord {{arpeggio}} sequence. It has [...] "catchy" [...] melody phrases during the verses and a synth trumpet {{at the end of}} the first chorus, as well as Armstrong's strings present in the background. It also contains sustained notes on the instrumental sections, a characteristic for the songs on Ray of Light. Doubled acoustic guitar chords give an organic vibe during the beginning of the second verse, following a brief coda. The song also infuses computer blips and techno effect sounds, which Orbit achieved by using a Korg MS-20 <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizer.</b> The producer explained that [...] "here's something about [...] transient peaks that are very spiky. And you can make that machine scream. Its two filters are very severe".|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the light}} pop flavor {{of these two}} records, Thriller, more so than Off the Wall, {{displayed}} foreshadowings of the contradictory thematic elements that would come to characterize Jackson's subsequent works. With Thriller, Jackson would begin his association with the subliminal motif of paranoia and darker themes, including supernatural imagery in the album's title track. This is evident on the songs [...] "Billie Jean", [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" [...] and [...] "Thriller". In [...] "Billie Jean", Jackson sings about an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered a child of hers; in [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" [...] he argues against gossips and the media. In the former song, Jones had Jackson sing vocal overdubs through a six-foot-long cardboard tube and brought in jazz saxophonist Tom Scott to play a rare instrument, the lyricon, a wind-controlled <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizer.</b> Bassist Louis Johnson ran through his part on a Yamaha bass guitar. The song opens with a long bass-and-drums introduction. In the song [...] "Thriller", sound effects such as creaking door, thunder, feet walking on wooden planks, winds and howling dogs can be heard.|$|E
500|$|The LP was {{produced}} primarily {{through use of}} synthesizers and drum machines. Prior its recording, Jam and Lewis had begun to update their equipment for Flyte Tyme studios, experimenting with different types of drum machines and keyboards. While Control had been recorded primarily using the LinnDrum machine, songs for Rhythm Nation 1814 were mostly recorded using the E-mu SP-1200, which was more commonplace for hip hop music at the time. The Oberheim OB-8 <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizer,</b> {{as well as those}} made by Sequential Circuits, were also used for mixing and recording. The only equipment utilized for the recording of Control that was also used for producing Rhythm Nation 1814 was the Ensoniq Mirage keyboard. The instrumental tracks for [...] "Miss You Much", [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" [...] and [...] "Escapade" [...] {{were among the first to}} be recorded, considered to be follow-ups to the [...] "beat-heavy, catchy songs" [...] that Jackson, Jam and Lewis crafted on Control which [...] "defined the punch and power of 1980s dance and pop music." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} Resonance of Fate was {{composed}} by Motoi Sakuraba and Kōhei Tanaka: Sakuraba had done work on multiple titles for tri-Ace titles, while Tanaka's most notable recent work {{was on the}} Sakura Wars series for Sega. Their work began in 2009. The two composers were asked to collaborate on Resonance of Fate by tri-Ace and Sega respectively. Sakuraba was originally going to compose 41 tracks for the game, but during development the number increased to 77. Tanaka's contribution amounted to between 30 and 40 pieces. Sakuraba was told to make the music in an old-fashioned style with no clear leitmotifs, while Tanaka had great freedom. One major directive was that their music tracks should contrast with each other. Sakuraba handled the game's battle music, with many of his tracks using a strong rock music element using synthesizers meant to emulate music from the 1960s and 70s. Some of his pieces were deliberately outside his usual style, using <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizer</b> and electric piano and recording the resultant sound after it had been fed through leslie speakers. He also worked against custom by improvising some pieces. Tanaka composed tracks for cutscenes, town areas, and the title theme; {{he was asked to}} focus on [...] "regal orchestra" [...] instrumentation. His tracks were recorded with a group of studio musicians at Hitomi Memorial Hall who were able to emulate the impact of a full orchestra.|$|E

2500|$|In 1983, however, Yamaha's revolutionary [...] DX7 [...] digital {{synthesizer}} {{swept through}} [...] popular music, {{leading to the}} adoption and development of digital synthesizers in many varying forms during the 1980s, and the rapid decline of <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizer</b> technology. [...] In 1987, Roland's D50 synthesizer was released, which combined the already existing sample-based synthesis and the onboard digital effects, while [...] Korg's even more popular M1 (1988) now also heralded {{the era of the}} workstation synthesizer, based on ROM sample sounds for composing and sequencing whole songs, rather than solely traditional sound synthesis.|$|E
2500|$|Media {{speculation}} in 2007 {{suggested that}} Aphex Twin was recording under another new alias, The Tuss, {{attributed to the}} names [...] "Brian Tregaskin" [...] and [...] "Karen Tregaskin". The Guardian newspaper and others printed rumours of The Tuss being a pseudonym of or a collaboration with Richard D. James. Contesting that, Rephlex's co-founder, Grant Wilson-Claridge, stated in a 2007 e-mail interview that The Tuss is not James, saying, [...] "People seem more interested in speculation and celebrity than content, quality or music. Be careful you don't miss something really great that isn't really famous." [...] However, all The Tuss tracks are published in the BMI repertoire under [...] "James Richard David", and the two The Tuss works use a Yamaha GX1, an exceptionally rare and expensive <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizer</b> that James is known to own.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 1990s the demand for vintage drum {{machines}} and synthesizers motivated a number of software companies to produce computer-based emulators. One of the most notable was the ReBirth RB-338, produced by the Swedish company Propellerhead and originally released in May 1997. Version one of the software featured two TB-303s and a TR-808 only, but the release of version two saw the inclusion of a TR-909. A Sound on Sound review of the RB-338 V2 in November 1998 noted that Rebirth had been called [...] "the ultimate techno software package" [...] and mentions that it was [...] "a considerable software success story of 1997". In America Keyboard Magazine asserted that ReBirth had [...] "opened up a whole new paradigm: modeled <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizer</b> tones, percussion synthesis, pattern-based sequencing, all integrated in one piece of software". Despite the success of ReBirth RB-338, it was officially taken out of production in September 2005. Propellerhead then made it freely available for download from a website called the [...] "ReBirth Museum". The site also features extensive information about the software's history and development.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970s, digital synthesizers and [...] digital {{samplers}} {{arrived on}} the market around the world (and are still sold today), as the result of preceding research and development. Compared with <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizer</b> sounds, the digital sounds produced by these new instruments tended to have a number of different characteristics: clear attack and sound outlines, carrying sounds, rich overtones with inharmonic contents, and complex motion of sound textures, amongst others. While these new instruments were expensive, these characteristics meant musicians were quick to adopt them, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States. This encouraged a trend towards producing music using digital sounds, and laid the foundations {{for the development of the}} inexpensive digital instruments popular in the next decade (see below). Relatively successful instruments, with each selling more than several hundred units per series, included the NED Synclavier (1977), Fairlight CMI (1979), E-mu Emulator (1981), and PPG Wave (1981).Note: Several sources point out that FM synthesis of Synclavier was [...] from Yamaha, who was an exclusively licensed from the original inventor, John Chowning.|$|E
2500|$|The {{synthesizer}} had {{a considerable}} effect on 20th-century music. Micky Dolenz of The Monkees bought {{one of the}} first Moog synthesizers. The band was the first to release an album featuring a Moog with Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd. in 1967, which reached number 1 in the [...] charts. [...] A few months later the title track of the Doors' 1967 album Strange Days featured a Moog played by Paul Beaver. In the same year, Bruce Haack built a homemade synthesizer that he demonstrated on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. The synthesizer included a sampler (musical instrument) that recorded, stored, played, and looped sounds controlled by switches, light sensors, and human skin contact. Wendy Carlos's Switched-On Bach (1968), recorded using Moog synthesizers, also influenced numerous musicians of that era {{and is one of the}} most popular recordings of classical music ever made, alongside the records (particularly Snowflakes are Dancing in 1974) of Isao Tomita, who in the early 1970s utilized synthesizers to create new artificial sounds (rather than simply mimicking real instruments) and made significant advances in <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizer</b> programming.|$|E

2500|$|In 1906, Lee de Forest {{invented the}} triode {{electronic}} valve. In 1915 he invented the first vacuum tube instrument, the audio piano. Then, until {{the invention of}} the transistor, the vacuum tube was an essential component in electric instruments. In 1935, the Hammond organ was introduced, exploiting previous limited production efforts like the [...] from 1923. It was capable of producing polyphonic sounds by virtue of a spinning shaft with many magnetic 'lobes' which would cycle past an electromagnetic pickup at a rate that would produce each desired tone. [...] "Tone Wheel Organ" [...] is the general name for this technology. The Hammond organ was connected to a power amplifier and a speaker cabinet. In 1929, the electric piano was invented. In 1939, Hammond introduced the Novachord which used about 170 vacuum tubes, coils, capacitors and resistors largely to create an upper octave of notes and then divide them in half using 'flip flop' circuits to create successively lower octaves from each note. But the instrument also has many features like envelopes for filter and amplifiers so that sounds can be contoured at the user's discretion, making it the first production <b>analog</b> <b>synthesizer.</b>|$|E
