50|$|The AirPort Express uses {{an audio}} {{connector}} that combines a 3.5 mm minijack socket and a mini-TOSLINK optical digital transmitter, allowing connection to an external digital-to-analog converter (DAC) or amplifier with internal DAC. Standard <b>audio</b> CDs <b>ripped</b> in iTunes into Apple Lossless format streamed to the AirPort Express will output a bit-for-bit identical bitstream {{when compared to}} the original CD (provided any sound enhancement settings in iTunes are disabled). DTS-encoded CDs ripped to Apple Lossless audio files - which decode as digital white noise in iTunes - will play back correctly when the AirPort Express is connected via TOSLINK to a DTS-compatible amplifier-decoder. This is limited to 16-bit and 44.1 kHz when streaming from iTunes. Any higher quality content, such as high fidelity audio that uses up to 24-bit and/or 192 kHz will be truncated down to 16-bit and 44.1 kHz.|$|R
50|$|Besides {{dealing with}} DVD copying issues, AnyDVD can also {{work in the}} {{background}} to automatically detect and remove additional data sessions contained on Audio CDs which contain copy-prevention measures.

Intentional tracking errors in the audio may also be discovered, for example, those errors involved with key2AudioXS, which may cause major skipping distortions in the <b>ripped</b> <b>audio</b> tracks. By bypassing these methods AnyDVD can provide clean, distortion-free playback and ripping.|$|R

The story featured YouTube-mp3.org - what Courrielche called the most highly trafficked stream ripping website in the world - and followed its founder Philip Matesanz in his creation of the site {{as well as his}} early conflicts with YouTube and its parent, Google. By tracking the former and current success of USA for Africa and it's famed song We Are The World, the investigation showed how the music industry was being negatively affected by stream ripping sites like YouTube-mp3.org and highlighted how YouTube-mp3.org and Google profit from the practice of stream ripping through advertising.
