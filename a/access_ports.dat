40|$|Dynamic {{and partial}} {{reconfiguration}} of Xilinx FPGAs {{is a well}} known technique in runtime adaptive system design. With this technique, parts of a configuration can be substituted while other parts stay operative without any disturbance. The advantage is the fact, that the spatial and temporal partitioning can be exploited with the goal to increase performance and to reduce power consumption due to the re-use of chip area. This paper shows a novel methodology {{for the inclusion of}} the configuration <b>access</b> <b>port</b> into the data path of a processor core in order to adapt the internal architecture and to re-use this <b>access</b> <b>port</b> as data- sink and source. It is obvious that the chip area, which is utilized by the hardware drivers for the internal configuration <b>access</b> <b>port</b> (ICAP), has to be as small as possible in comparison to the application functionality. Therefore, a hardware design with a small footprint, but with an adequate performance in terms of data throughput, is necessary. This paper presents a fast data path for dynamic and partial reconfiguration data with the advantage of a small footprint on the hardware resources...|$|R
