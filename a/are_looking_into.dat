25|$|On 29 June 2010, the Palermo Court of Appeals {{reduced the}} 2004 nine-year {{sentence}} for collusion with the Mafia to seven years. In reviewing the previous sentence, {{the appeals court}} said the conviction stood only for acts committed by Dell'Utri prior to 1992, while he was acquitted for charges after that year. The prosecution had asked that the sentence be increased to 11 years. The judges took six days to consider their decision, an extraordinary long time for deliberations. The verdict effectively cleared Dell'Utri and Italian prime minister Berlusconi over allegations his entry into politics was backed by Cosa Nostra and a terrorist bombing campaign. However, Prosecuting Offices in other Italian cities <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> these allegations.|$|E
500|$|On May 1, 18 {{days after}} the episode's {{original}} airdate, a failed car bomb attempt was discovered by the New York City Police Department near the eastern corner of 1 Astor Plaza in New York City, on West 45 Street, on a side street near {{the location of the}} world headquarters of Viacom, Comedy Central's parent company. Some news outlets reported that police <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> a possible link between the attempted bombing and the warnings of violence against Trey Parker and Matt Stone, although no such link has yet been established. Such speculation was also fueled by statements from U.S. Congressman Peter T. King, who described as one possible motive [...] "the whole issue with 'South Park,' which Islamic terrorists were threatening to have retribution for." [...] However, King stressed the theory was [...] "one possibility out of a hundred". Revolution Muslim has denied any involvement with the incident. Younus Abdullah Muhammed, who runs the group's website, was in Times Square at the time speaking out against President Barack Obama with a loudspeaker. But he said of the failed car bomb, [...] "What do you think, I commanded somebody to blow up a building in the middle of Times Square? [...] It {{had nothing to do with}} the 'South Park' controversy. It was not an attack targeting Viacom." [...] NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly said of the theory, [...] "We certainly wouldn't rule that out." [...] However, media reports indicated Faisal Shahzad, the suspect arrested in connection with the attempted bombing, had trained for months prior to the first broadcast of [...] "200." ...|$|E

500|$|Following Fight Clubs release, several fight clubs were {{reported}} to have started in the United States. A [...] "Gentleman's Fight Club" [...] was started in Menlo Park, California in 2000 and had members mostly from the tech industry. Teens and preteens in Texas, New Jersey, Washington state, and Alaska also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, leading authorities to break up the clubs. In 2006, an unwilling participant from a local high school was injured at a fight club in Arlington, Texas, and the DVD sales of the fight led to the arrest of six teenagers. An unsanctioned fight club was also started at Princeton University, where matches were held on campus. The film was suspected of influencing Luke Helder, a college student who planted pipe bombs in mailboxes in 2002. Helder's goal was to create a smiley pattern on the map of the United States, similar to the scene in Fight Club in which a building is vandalized to have a smiley on its exterior. On July 16, 2009, a 17-year-old who had formed his own fight club in Manhattan was charged with detonating a homemade bomb outside a Starbucks Coffee shop in the Upper East Side. The New York City Police Department reported the suspect was trying to emulate [...] "Project Mayhem". In September 2015, two employees at Lightbridge Academy, a New Jersey daycare center, were charged with instigating [...] "Fight Club–style" [...] brawls between children aged four to six years of age. The fights {{were reported}}ly filmed and uploaded to Snapchat, a video messaging application, and involved approximately a [...] "dozen boys and girls". In the videos, one of the perpetrators, Erica Kenny, can be heard making references to Fight Club. The charges stem from an incident that occurred on August 13, 2015, but investigators <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> whether the fights were ongoing.|$|E

A spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said the Onyango case had been referred to the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility and its parent department's inspector general for investigation of the leak.

2500|$|In March 2008, it was {{reported}} the American network NBC had bought the rights to produce an American remake from Baby Cow Productions. Initial ideas according to Corden were to have Gavin coming from New Jersey and Stacey from South Carolina, meeting up in New York City. In December 2008 however, Jones stated [...] "There was a script written for NBC. They optioned it, but then that went away. I read the script and it wasn't great {{to be honest with}} you. But now ABC <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> writing a pilot and hopefully that will work out". At the time, both Corden and Jones were reportedly acting as executive producers of the ABC version, while interviewing other people for the job of writing the adaptation.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, certain {{organizations}} <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> biomass briquette substitution {{in order}} to reduce the demand for fuelwood. Sustainable fuelwood production techniques are also being implemented. The Eco-Makala project under the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has pledged to reforest 4500 ha by 2012 to provide the people of Goma with fuelwood. In the project, the trees are planted on soil belonging to local farmers, with the farmer's permission. The farmer hence becomes owner of the trees, and is able to make his own charcoal from these using a clamp. This amount of wood being planted to offset fuelwood collection is minimal when considering that over 300,000 ha of forest are destroyed each year alone. [...] The REDD campaign is aimed at addressing climate change as all of it projects are working towards an overall world reduction in its emissions by approximately 17 Gt CO2e by 2020 {{in order to}} arrive at the GHG atmospheric concentration target of 445 parts per million (pm) of CO2e.|$|E

The two collaborated on the Moto Guzzi V12 series, with Le Mans, Strada, and X variants, displayed at EICMA in 2009. Galluzzi described the challenge he and Terblanche faced revising the Moto Guzzi image by saying, [...] "The Guzzi crowd is extremely conservative, but if we only concentrate on those, {{we are going to}} lose eventually. So these bikes <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> the future." [...] This is similar to the balance sought with earlier Ducati designs, but, [...] "the advantage Guzzi has versus Ducati is that Ducati makes sportsbikes, Guzzi can do anything it wants because they’ve been doing it a long time and on all sorts of bikes." ...|$|E
