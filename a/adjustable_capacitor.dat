50|$|In the past, {{the bypass}} {{capacitor}} in the probe head was adjustable (to achieve this 10× attenuation). More modern probe designs use a laser-trimmed thick-film electronic circuit {{in the head}} that combines the 9 megohm resistor with a fixed-value bypass capacitor; they then place a small <b>adjustable</b> <b>capacitor</b> in parallel with the oscilloscope's input capacitance. Either way, the probe must be adjusted so that it provides uniform attenuation at all frequencies. This {{is referred to as}} compensating the probe. Compensation is usually accomplished by probing a 1 kHz square wave and adjusting the compensating capacitor until the oscilloscope displays the most square waveshape. Most oscilloscopes have a 1 kHz calibration source on their front panels since probe compensation must be done every time a 10:1 probe is attached to an oscilloscope input. Newer, faster probes have more complex compensation arrangements and may occasionally require further adjustments.|$|E
25|$|Small {{capacitors}} {{are used}} in electronic devices to couple signals between stages of amplifiers, as components of electric filters and tuned circuits, or as parts of power supply systems to smooth rectified current. Larger capacitors are used for energy storage in such applications as strobe lights, as parts of some types of electric motors, or for power factor correction in AC power distribution systems. Standard capacitors have a fixed value of capacitance, but <b>adjustable</b> <b>capacitors</b> are frequently used in tuned circuits. Different types are used depending on required capacitance, working voltage, current handling capacity, and other properties.|$|R

50|$|In {{vacuum-tube}} oscilloscopes made by Tektronix, {{the vertical}} amplifier's delay line {{was a long}} frame, L-shaped for space reasons, that carried several dozen discrete inductors and a corresponding number of low-capacitance <b>adjustable</b> ("trimmer") cylindrical <b>capacitors.</b> These oscilloscopes had plug-in vertical input channels. For adjusting the delay line capacitors, a high-pressure gas-filled mercury-wetted reed switch created extremely fast-rise pulses which {{went directly to the}} later stages of the vertical amplifier. With a fast sweep, any misadjustment created a dip or bump, and touching a capacitor made its local part of the waveform change. Adjusting the capacitor made its bump disappear. Eventually, a flat top resulted.|$|R
