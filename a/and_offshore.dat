In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation.

The settlements are {{in the form of}} exterior and interior walls, and fort bastions. From the typological classification of the anchors it is inferred that Dwarka had flourished as a port during the period of the Middle kingdoms of India.

METHOD- Literature review is the main source of the research. RESULT- It is very challenging to apply either of the two approaches in software development. When implementing both approaches at the same time, it requires tremendous efforts and up-front investment to make the change, and the result of integration would lead to increasing managerial difficulties.

5|$|Hunting along {{migration}} routes threatens some bird species. The {{populations of}} Siberian cranes (Leucogeranus leucogeranus) that wintered in India declined due to hunting along the route, particularly in Afghanistan and Central Asia. Birds were last seen in their favourite wintering grounds in Keoladeo National Park in 2002. Structures such as power lines, wind farms <b>and</b> <b>offshore</b> oil-rigs {{have also been}} known to affect migratory birds. Other migration hazards include pollution, storms, wildfires, and habitat destruction along migration routes, denying migrants food at stopover points. For example, in the East Asian–Australasian Flyway, up to 65% of key intertidal habitat at the Yellow Sea migration bottleneck has been destroyed since the 1950s.|$|E

40|$|I discuss {{reasons why}} {{manufacturing}} productivity statistics {{should be interpreted}} with caution in light of the recent growth of domestic and foreign outsourcing <b>and</b> <b>offshoring.</b> First, outsourcing <b>and</b> <b>offshoring</b> are poorly measured in U. S. statistics, and poor measurement may impart a significant bias to manufacturing <b>and,</b> where <b>offshoring</b> is involved, aggregate productivity statistics. Second, companies often outsource or offshore work to take advantage of cheap (relative to their output) labor, and such cost savings are counted as productivity gains, even in multifactor productivity calculations. This fact has potentially important implications for the interpretation of productivity statistics. Whether, for instance, productivity growth derives from a better-educated, more efficient U. S. workforce, from investment in capital equipment in U. S. establishments, or from the use of cheap foreign labor affects how productivity gains are distributed among workers and firms in the short term and undoubtedly matters for U. S. industrial competitiveness and living standards in the long term. Although it is impossible to fully assess the impact that mismeasurement and cost savings from outsourcing <b>and</b> <b>offshoring</b> have had on measured productivity growth in manufacturing, I point to several pieces o...|$|R
