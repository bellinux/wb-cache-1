5|$|In Texas, about 250,000people {{evacuated}} Orange and Jefferson counties. Galveston City Manager Doug Matthews advised {{residents to}} develop <b>an</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>plan</b> {{in the event}} that the city chose to call for evacuations. The city later decided against ordering an evacuation. School was canceled on August 25 for Beaumont, Port Arthur, and other areas of central Jefferson County, while schools were closed in Dickinson, High Island, Hitchcock, La Marque, Santa Fe, and Texas City on August 26. College of the Mainland, Galveston College, and Texas A University at Galveston were also closed. Emergency management crews in Corpus Christi began testing emergency generators and severe weather gear. The Comal County chapter of the Red Cross placed their disaster alert teams on standby and ready to respond if the hurricane threatened the Corpus Christi area.|$|E
5|$|When the German Operation Nordwind {{offensive}} threatened Strasbourg, Pash {{ordered all}} captured documents to be removed. Papers indicating {{the nature of}} the Alsos Mission were removed or destroyed. Although Strasbourg was not abandoned by the Allies, and ultimately did not fall, the Alsos Mission departed the city on 8 January 1945. Pash even ordered <b>an</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>plan</b> to be prepared for the Alsos Mission's main headquarters in Paris. The embarrassing series of intelligence failures that had led up to the Battle of the Bulge cast doubts on the Alsos Mission's own findings. A four-man team under Eckman was sent to investigate a suspiciously devastating V-2 explosion near Antwerp, and Fred Wardenburg had to confirm {{that it was not a}} small nuclear explosion. Rumors that Germany had an atomic bomb persisted as late as March 1945.|$|E
5|$|Large swells {{produced}} by the storm resulted in about 1,000 lifeguard rescues in Orange County, California. High temperatures in southern California, exceeding 100°F (37.7°C) in places, and cool ocean temperatures led to an estimated 575,000 people going to beaches during the Labor Day weekend. One incident required 25 rescues as dozens of people were overwhelmed by 810ft (2.43m) waves. Officials in San Bernardino County advised residents to take precautions {{for the possibility of}} flooding as a result of moisture from the remnants of Howard. Following wildfires in 2003, foothills were highly susceptible to flooding. Residents were advised to have sandbags ready, ensure their emergency supplies were stocked and have <b>an</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>plan.</b> Despite all the preparations undertaken, Howard did not produced any rainfall in California. The moisture also enhanced rainfall across portions of Arizona. This led to minor rainfall accumulations throughout the state.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Da Nang fall into North Vietnamese hands, South Vietnamese commanders {{on the ground}} simply lost control of their men as {{military}} discipline collapsed. On March 28, about 6,000 South Vietnamese soldiers of the 2nd Infantry Division deserted, and left the battlefield. And then the soldiers of the ARVN 3rd Infantry Division also retreated, thereby leaving {{the rear of the}} Marine Corps Division exposed to enemy attacks. Since March 25, from the CIA Station in Da Nang, Al Francis and the U.S. Embassy in Saigon began formulating <b>an</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>plan,</b> in order to evacuate U.S. citizens and South Vietnamese government officials out from Da Nang. As part of the plan, aircraft belonging to civilian airliners were to be used. And in addition to the South Vietnamese navy vessels of I Corps, U.S. General Homer Smith also provided five barges, six passenger liners, and three cargo ships to help with the evacuation process. Even though the evacuation plan was designed to be carried out in an orderly manner, chaos and confusion quickly descended on the civilian and military population of Da Nang as people fought each other to board the vessels anchored off the coast. On the afternoon of March 29, North Vietnamese soldiers of the 2nd, 304th, 324th and 325th Divisions, as well as the 203rd Armoured Regiment, entered the city of Da Nang.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEarthquakes {{are one of}} {{the most}} fatal {{disasters}} in Japan. In preparation for them, each organization has to create its <b>evacuation</b> <b>plan</b> of their buildings. For universities, creating effective <b>evacuation</b> <b>plans</b> is worth challenging since they have many constraints on class schedules, class sizes, room sizes, room equipment, and so on; and the number of students and instructors in each room varies from time to time. However, it is not realistic to have many <b>evacuation</b> <b>plans</b> corresponding to various situations. In addition, it is difficult for universities to have specialists for developing <b>evacuation</b> <b>plans,</b> and administrative staff are not skilled in such planning. Our project is to create <b>an</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>planning</b> system helpful for non-specialists. As a first step, an analyzing engine is developed.

During a series of press conferences, White and Harris County County Judge Robert Eckels instructed Houstonians on when to evacuate.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{describe}} a dynamic network optimization-based solution framework that effectively integrates {{the management of}} complex information with traffic strategies and logistics support. This framework is composed of a transportation management function, a logistics support and capacity refinement function, and a validation function. The transportation management function is central to this solution framework and is mainly composed of four modules; a Rough-Cut Capacity Plan (RCCP), a Detailed Capacity <b>Plan</b> (DCP), <b>a</b> Restricted <b>Evacuation</b> <b>Plan</b> (REP) and <b>an</b> Enforced <b>Evacuation</b> <b>Plan</b> (EEP). This research has been motivated by the challenges experienced during the hurricane Rita evacuation of the City of Houston.

However, {{little attention has been}} paid to evacuee real decision psychology when developing a strategy. The aim of this paper is to analyze evacuee mode choice behavior considering regret aversion psychology during evacuation. First, the utility-based and regret-based models are formulated to obtain evacuees’ preferences on travel mode choice, respectively. According to the data collected from the stated preference (SP) survey on evacuee mode choice, the estimation results show that the regret-based model performs better than the utility model. Moreover, based on the estimates from behavioral analysis, the elasticities of evacuee mode choices are calculated, and transit strategy simulation is undertaken to investigate the influence on evacuee mode switching from private automobile to public transit. The results are expected to help emergency administrators to make a transit-oriented strategy for <b>a</b> sustainable <b>evacuation</b> <b>plan,</b> especially for the benefit of carless people...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify common problems encountered during hospital evacuations and how those problems are or should be addressed when creating <b>a</b> hospital <b>evacuation</b> <b>plan.</b> Methods: Articles relating to hospital evacuations were retrieved from PubMed and CINAHL in addition to government websites and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. The articles collected were limited to within the last 20 years, from 1990 to 2010. Hospital plans were collected from search engines including Google and Yahoo. Moreover, a plan was obtained from a Dayton area hospital. Results: Numerous instances of hospital evacuations that were attributed earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and fires have been documented. Frequently cited problems in these evacuations were related to communication, transportation and staffing problems. The hospital <b>evacuation</b> <b>plans</b> that were reviewed included the San Joaquin County Hospital <b>Evacuation</b> <b>Plan,</b> New York Center for Terrorism Planning and Preparedness, Washington Hospital Center Emergency <b>Evacuation</b> <b>Plan</b> and <b>a</b> Dayton, Ohio Hospital Emergency <b>Evacuation</b> <b>Plan.</b> Discussion: Plans {{need to be able to}} incorporate communication needs including emergency radios and cellular telephones with backup power sources. Updated call-lists are also crucial components to the successful execution of <b>a</b> hospital <b>evacuation</b> by helping to alleviate potential staffing shortages during an event. Transportation needs, including mutual aid agreements, need to be frequently reviewed and innovative measures must be taken to ensure success. Conclusion: Hospitals today are not prepared to adequately handle <b>an</b> <b>evacuation.</b> Comprehensive <b>plans</b> that incorporate the lessons learned from previous evacuations are crucial components for community resiliency...|$|R
