5000|$|And then, there's Rias. Aside {{from being}} the {{president}} of the Occult club, she's also the daughter of house Gremory, one of the bigger devil's families. Her personality in general seems to be an even mix of a lot of things; she's supportive, pointing out that she took to issei like a big sister to her little brother; she's responsible yet relatively carefree. <b>And,</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> not, her big sister act for Issei's benefit is actually quite endearing. Predictably, that relationship status will eventually be exchanged with a different one -- more on that later -- but the bottom line is; despite this show having all the essentials of a dumb harem, it really hit paydirt with its characters.
