5|$|Series co-creator Ed Boon {{designed}} Deception to be <b>an</b> <b>unpredictable</b> fighting game, {{and included}} new {{features such as}} the minigames as surprises. Several parts from Deadly Alliance such as combos and arenas were redesigned to be more realistic {{as well as more}} interactive. Deception has been well received by video game reviewers, who praised the fights and the new features. The Konquest Mode, however, received criticism for poor voice acting. Several publications have called Deception the best fighting game of 2004.|$|E
5|$|Jerry was <b>an</b> <b>unpredictable</b> storm as the {{strengthening}} before landfall and the continuation {{to the northwest}} was not anticipated. Equipment failure meant that data was not readily available. The National Hurricane Center forecast model was also disabled, throwing the accuracy of Jerry's track off. Tropical cyclone warnings and watches began early on October14, with a hurricane watch for Port Arthur, Texas {{to the mouth of}} the Mississippi River in Louisiana. At 2200UTC later that day, a tropical storm watch was issued for the entire coast of Louisiana. Another tropical storm watch was posted from Port O'Connor, Texas to Morgan City, Louisiana at 1200UTC on October15.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Chirocephalus diaphanus is {{extremely}} fast. The typical duration of a full life cycle is not known, but a figure of around 3 months has been suggested. The eggs are tolerant to drying out; when their habitat fills with water again, some of the eggs will hatch, while others remain dormant. This enables the species to continue to survive in <b>an</b> <b>unpredictable</b> habitat, since some eggs remain in case the habitat does not persist for {{long enough for the}} animals to mate and produce offspring. Dispersal between bodies of water can occur through the movements of animals such as cattle, deer and horses.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Elena was <b>an</b> <b>unpredictable</b> and {{damaging}} tropical cyclone that affected {{eastern and central}} portions of the United States Gulf Coast in late August and early September 1985. Threatening popular tourist destinations during Labor Day weekend, Elena repeatedly deviated from its forecast path, triggering evacuations of unprecedented extent. The hurricane wrought havoc to property and the environment between southwestern Florida and eastern Louisiana, though lesser effects were felt well beyond those areas. Elena developed on August 28 near Cuba, and after traveling lengthwise across the island with little impact, it entered the Gulf of Mexico and continued to strengthen. Initially projected to strike the central Gulf Coast, the hurricane unexpectedly veered toward the east on August 30, then stalled just 50mi (80km) west of Cedar Key, Florida. Despite predictions that Elena would continue eastward across Florida, the cyclone remained nearly stationary for about 48 hours, causing damage all along the eastern gulf with high winds and waves, before slowly moving northwest and ultimately making landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi, on September 2 as a Category 3 major hurricane. The storm quickly weakened upon moving ashore and dissipated on September 4.|$|E
5|$|It {{was once}} {{suggested}} {{that the relationship between}} the obligate and regular ant-followers and the army ants, particularly Eciton burchellii, was mutualistic, with the ants benefiting by having the birds chase prey back down towards them. However, experiments where ant followers were excluded have shown that the foraging success of the army ants was 30% lower when the birds were present, suggesting that the birds' relationship was in fact parasitic. This has resulted in a number of behaviours by the ants in order to reduce kleptoparasitism, including hiding of secured prey in the leaf litter and caching of food on trails. It has been {{suggested that the}} depressive effect of this parasitism slows the development of E. burchellii swarms and in turn benefits other ant species which are preyed upon by army ants. The ant-following antbirds are themselves followed by three species of butterfly in the family Ithomiinae which feed on their droppings. Bird droppings are usually <b>an</b> <b>unpredictable</b> resource in a rainforest, but the regular behaviour of ant followers makes the exploitation of this resource possible.|$|E

5|$|Like live action, machinima is {{recorded}} in real-time, and real people can act {{and control the}} camera. Filmmakers are often encouraged to follow traditional cinematic conventions, such as avoiding wide fields of view, the overuse of slow motion, and errors in visual continuity. Unlike live action, machinima involves less expensive, digital special effects and sets, possibly with a science-fiction or historical theme. Explosions and stunts can be tried and repeated without monetary cost and risk of injury, and the host environment may allow unrealistic physical constraints. University of Cambridge experiments in 2002 and 2003 attempted to use machinima to re-create {{a scene from the}} 1942 live-action film Casablanca. Machinima filming differed from traditional cinematography in that character expression was limited, but camera movements were more flexible and improvised. Nitsche compared this experiment to <b>an</b> <b>unpredictable</b> Dogme 95 production.|$|E
5|$|While RAD {{is likely}} to occur {{following}} neglectful and abusive childcare, {{there should be no}} automatic diagnosis on this basis alone as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors but on its own does not explain attachment disorder. Experiences of abuse are associated with the development of disorganised attachment, in which the child prefers a familiar caregiver, but responds to that person in <b>an</b> <b>unpredictable</b> and somewhat bizarre way. Within official classifications, attachment disorganization is a risk factor but not in itself an attachment disorder. Further although attachment disorders tend to occur in the context of some institutions, repeated changes of primary caregiver or extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the new US President Ronald Reagan {{pursued a}} hard line {{approach}} to Libya, erroneously claiming it to be puppet regime of the Soviet Union. In turn, Gaddafi played up his commercial relationship with the Soviets, visiting Moscow again in April 1981 and 1985, and in 1978 threatening to join the Warsaw Pact. The Soviets were nevertheless cautious of Gaddafi, seeing him as <b>an</b> <b>unpredictable</b> extremist. Beginning military exercises in the Gulf of Sirte – an area of sea that Libya claimed {{as a part of}} its territorial waters – in August 1981 the US shot down two Libyan Su-22 planes monitoring them. Closing down Libya's embassy in Washington, D.C., Reagan advised US companies operating in the country {{to reduce the number of}} American personnel stationed there. In March 1982, the US implemented an embargo of Libyan oil, and in January 1986 ordered all US companies to cease operating in the country, although several hundred workers remained when the Libyan government doubled their pay. Diplomatic relations also broke down with the UK, after Libyan diplomats were accused in the killing of Yvonne Fletcher, a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy, in April 1984. In Spring 1986, the US Navy again began performing exercises in the Gulf of Sirte; the Libyan military retaliated, but failed as the US sank several Libyan ships.|$|E

But this is not viewed useful since VUFs appear to be much easier to construct than VRFs.|$|R
