5|$|Before {{the launch}} of the Dreamcast in Japan, Sega {{announced}} the release of its New <b>Arcade</b> Operation Machine Idea (NAOMI) <b>arcade</b> board, which served as a cheaper alternative to the Sega Model 3.

Ownership of the <b>arcade</b> subsequently passed down to the Chesham family. In 1911, another storey was added by Beresford Pite, who also added the Chesham arms.

By 1996, the number of <b>arcade</b> machines sold approached 25,000 units; at that time, <b>arcade</b> games that sold 5,000 units were considered strong titles (Midway printed special T-shirts to celebrate 300 machines being manufactured in one day) and an <b>arcade</b> cabinet cost $3,0004,000. MKII was considered an <b>arcade</b> game of the year, taking over from the original Mortal Kombat.|$|E

5|$|Rare took greater liberties with {{violence}} and gore in Battletoads <b>Arcade</b> since {{the product was}} not destined for home consoles. It was Rare's first game to use the 3D graphics technology later popularized in Donkey Kong Country and Killer Instinct. Although the game playtested well {{and appeared to be}} financially viable, the publisher hesitated to release it. The game proved unsuccessful in the arcades and its in-production Super NES port was canceled. Retrospective reviews were more positive--Retro Gamer even declared it the best of the series. Battletoads <b>Arcade</b> received its console debut when it was emulated in the 2015 Rare Replay, a compilation of games from Rare's history for the Xbox One.
