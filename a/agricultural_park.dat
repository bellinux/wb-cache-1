The Department of Building and Housing also released {{a plan for the}} construction of 500 modular homes. While emergency repairs were performed on damaged houses by Fletcher Construction, rebuilding would be delayed by the need for full land assessments, with the possibility that some of the worst-affected areas in the eastern suburbs might need to be abandoned due to land depression and severe liquefaction, with the residents offered relocation to new subdivisions under their EQC insurance policies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. After nearly 20 {{years of}} development, <b>agricultural</b> S&T <b>parks</b> in Beijing {{have become an}} {{important}} carrier and the leading force for the metropolitan modern agriculture development in the capital, and an important model for the modern agriculture development in metropolis. But {{in the process of}} the <b>agricultural</b> S&T <b>parks</b> development, low park productivity, insufficient regional integrated development and sustainable development fatigue widely exist. Under the construction of "World City with Chinese Characteristics " and "Humanistic, S&T and Green Beijing", <b>agricultural</b> S&T <b>parks</b> are facing higher development requirements, and it has become a very urgent need to innovatively transform the model of <b>agricultural</b> S&T <b>parks</b> development from "introduction-demonstration-popularization " to "innovation-service-combination of the two". In this paper, based on the scientific analysis of the current situation of <b>agricultural</b> S&T <b>parks</b> in Beijing and the objective analysis of the environmental conditions, by applying such theoretic approaches as strategic analysis, value analysis, knowledge network and so on, the author proposes the innovative development model for <b>agricultural</b> S&T <b>parks</b> in Beijing, including path model of "integration of urban and rural development " at regional level, business model of "three-chain integration " at park operation level and the profitability model of "knowledge creation " at enterprise level. Thees innovative models ar...|$|R
2500|$|From 1871 to 1911, {{the site}} of the rose garden was part of the city's <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Park.</b> The rose garden area was then used for horse, camel, dog, and later {{automobile}} racing; it also reportedly housed the city's longest bar and [...] "one of its most stylish brothels." [...] In 1914, the city announced plans to construct a wildflower garden at the park, but the rose garden was not built until 1927 with the planting of 15,000 bushes of more than 100 varieties. When the garden was announced, the Los Angeles Times applauded the project: [...] "No more fitting tribute could be paid to the spirit of Southern California than to erect in the center of her largest city the greatest rose garden in the world." [...] During the Great Depression, the lack of funding threatened the closure of the rose garden, then described as [...] "the largest rose garden in the world." ...|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{systems are}} {{embedded}} in wider social-ecological processes that {{must be considered in}} any complete discussion of sustainable agriculture. Just as climatic profiles will influence the future viability of crops, institutions, i. e., governance agreements, rural household and community norms, local associations, markets, and agricultural ministries, to name but a few, create the conditions that foster sustainable food systems. Because discussions of agricultural sustainability often overlook the full range of social dimensions, we propose a dual focus on a broad set of criteria, i. e., human health, labor, democratic participation, resiliency, biological and cultural diversity, equity, and ethics, to assess social outcomes, and on institutions that could support diversified farming systems (DFS). A comparative analysis of case studies from California&# 039;s Central Valley, Mesoamerican coffee agroforestry systems, and European Union <b>agricultural</b> <b>parks</b> finds that DFS practices are unevenly adopted within and among these systems and interdependent with institutional environments that specifically promote diversified farming practices. Influential institutions in these cases include state policies, farmers&# 039; cooperatives/associations, and organized civic efforts to influence agroenvironmental policy, share knowledge, and shape markets for more &# 039;sustainable&# 039; products. The Californian and Mesoamerican cases considers organic and fair trade certifications, finding that although they promote several DFS practices and generate social benefits, they are inadequate as a single strategy to promote agricultural sustainability. The complex governance and multifunctional management of Europe&# 039;s peri-urban <b>agricultural</b> <b>parks</b> show unexpected potential for promoting DFS. Unless DFS are anchored in supportive institutions and evaluated against an inclusive set of social and environmental criteria, short-term investments to advance diversified agriculture could miss a valuable opportunity to connect ecological benefits with social benefits in the medium and long terms...|$|R
