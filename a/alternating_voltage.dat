A cycloconverter operates as a three-phase current source via three anti-parallel-connected SCR-bridges in six-pulse configuration, each cycloconverter phase acting selectively to convert fixed line frequency AC voltage to an <b>alternating</b> <b>voltage</b> at a variable load frequency. MC drives are IGBT-based.|$|E
500|$|The {{simplest}} of these circuits are {{a form of}} rectifier which take an AC voltage as input and outputs a doubled DC voltage. [...] The switching elements are simple diodes and they are driven to switch state merely by the <b>alternating</b> <b>voltage</b> of the input. [...] DC-to-DC voltage doublers cannot switch in this way and require a driving circuit to control the switching.

50|$|A {{transformer}} is {{an electrical}} device that transfers electrical energy between {{two or more}} circuits through electromagnetic induction. A varying current in one coil of the transformer produces a varying magnetic field, which in turn induces a voltage in a second coil. Power can be transferred between the two coils through the magnetic field, without a metallic {{connection between the two}} circuits. Faraday's law of induction discovered in 1831 described this effect. Transformers are used to increase or decrease the <b>alternating</b> <b>voltages</b> in electric power applications.|$|R
2500|$|Film {{capacitors}} are not polarized and {{are suitable}} for handling an <b>alternating</b> <b>voltage.</b> Because the rated AC voltage is specified as an RMS value, the nominal AC voltage must be smaller than the rated DC voltage.

A changing dielectric constant with frequency is referred to as dielectric dispersion, and is governed by dielectric relaxation processes, such as Debye relaxation.

50|$|By using a {{transmission}} gate to switch <b>alternating</b> <b>voltages</b> (e.g.: audio signal), the negative power supply potential must {{be lower than}} the lowest signal potential. This ensures that the substrate diode will remain non-conducting even at negative voltages. Although the transmission gate can still switch to logic voltage levels, there are special versions with integrated level shifters. A good example, is the 4053 standard chip, commonly used to select between analogue inputs to an audio amplifier, has a separate ground (pin 8) and negative substrate connection (pin 7) that also supplies the level shifter.|$|R

2500|$|An AC voltage {{will cause}} an AC current (with an applied DC bias {{this is also}} called [...] "ripple current"), with cyclic {{charging}} and discharging of the capacitor causing oscillating motion of the electric dipoles in the dielectric. This results in dielectric losses, which are the principal component of the ESR of film capacitors, and which produce heat from the alternating current. The maximum RMS <b>alternating</b> <b>voltage</b> at a given frequency which may be applied continuously to a capacitor (up to the rated temperature) {{is defined as the}} rated AC voltage UR AC. Rated AC voltages usually are specified at the mains frequency of a region (50 or 60nbsp&Hz).|$|E

[...] The transmitter and receiver electrodes form a capacitor, with the intervening space as the dielectric.

2500|$|An {{aspect of}} most {{rectification}} {{is a loss}} from the peak input voltage to the peak output voltage, caused by the built-in voltage drop across the diodes (around 0.7 V for ordinary silicon p–n junction diodes and 0.3 V for Schottky diodes). Half-wave rectification and full-wave rectification using a center-tapped secondary produces a peak voltage loss of one diode drop. Bridge rectification has a loss of two diode drops. This reduces output voltage, and limits the available output voltage if a very low <b>alternating</b> <b>voltage</b> must be rectified. As the diodes do not conduct below this voltage, the circuit only passes current through {{for a portion of}} each half-cycle, causing short segments of zero voltage (where instantaneous input voltage is below one or two diode drops) to appear between each [...] "hump".|$|E
2500|$|In operation, {{a current}} {{flows through the}} {{filament}} (heater)—a high resistance wire made of nichrome—and heats the cathode red hot (800–1000°C).

[...] The <b>alternating</b> <b>voltage</b> to be rectified is applied between the cathode and the concentric plate electrode. [...] When the plate has a positive voltage {{with respect to the}} cathode, it electrostatically attracts the electrons from the cathode, so a current of electrons flows through the tube from cathode to plate. [...] However, when the polarity is reversed and the plate has a negative voltage, no current flows, because the cathode electrons are not attracted to it. [...] The plate, being unheated, does not emit any electrons. So electrons can only flow through the tube in one direction, from the cathode to the anode plate.|$|E

2500|$|The first Avometer had a {{sensitivity}} of 60 {{ohms per volt}}, three direct current ranges (12mA, 1.2A, and 12A), three direct voltage ranges (12, 120, and 600V or optionally 1200V), and a 10,000ohm resistance range. An improved version of 1927 increased this to 13-ranges and 166.6 ohms per volt (6 mA) movement. A [...] "Universal" [...] version having additional alternating current and <b>alternating</b> <b>voltage</b> ranges was offered from 1933 and in 1936 the dual sensitivity Avometer Model 7 offered 500/100 ohms per volt. Between the mid 1930s until the 1950s, 1000 ohms per volt became a de facto standard of sensitivity for radio work and this figure was often quoted on service sheets. However, some manufacturers such as Simpson, Triplett and Weston, all in the USA, produced 20,000 ohm per volt VOMs before the Second World War {{and some of these}} were exported.

2500|$|The 50/60Hz {{currents}} {{in the primary}} circuit of a Tesla coil are lethally dangerous, and require standard safety precautions used with other kilovolt electrical devices. [...] However, the high voltage radio frequency (RF) discharges from the output terminal pose a unique hazard not found in other high voltage equipment: when passed through the body they often do not cause the painful sensation and muscle contraction of electric shock, as lower frequency AC or DC currents do. [...] The nervous system is insensitive to currents with frequencies over 10 – 20kHz. [...] It is thought {{that the reason for}} this is that a certain minimum number of ions must be driven across a nerve cell's membrane by the imposed voltage to trigger the nerve cell to transmit an impulse.

2500|$|Modern {{transistor}} or {{vacuum tube}} Tesla coils {{do not use}} a primary spark gap. Instead, the transistor(s) or vacuum tube(s) provide the switching or amplifying function necessary to generate RF power for the primary circuit. Solid-state Tesla coils use the lowest primary operating voltage, typically between 155 and 800 volts, and drive the primary winding using either a single, half-bridge, or full-bridge arrangement of bipolar transistors, MOSFETs or IGBTs to switch the primary current. Vacuum tube coils typically operate with plate voltages between 1500 and 6000 volts, while most spark gap coils operate with primary voltages of 6,000 to 25,000 volts. The primary winding of a traditional transistor Tesla coil is wound around only the bottom portion of the secondary coil.
