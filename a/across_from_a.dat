5|$|Pfaster, who {{was behind}} the exhumations, proves Mulder's {{prediction}} correct when he brings a prostitute to his apartment. When the prostitute discovers a collection of funerary wreaths in Pfaster's bedroom, he kills her and removes her fingers. Later, Pfaster—having been hired as a frozen food delivery man through charming the female interviewer—delivers to a low-security house {{of a woman with}} teenage daughters. He requests the bathroom to wash his hands, and whilst there steals some discarded hair from a brush he found in the trashcan. Pfaster attends a night class at a community college, where a female classmate defends herself after he makes threatening advances. He is arrested and is placed in a jail cell <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> suspect being interrogated for Pfaster's crimes by Mulder, Scully, and Bocks. Pfaster shows interest in Scully, and learns her name from the interrogated suspect. Pfaster is later released as his charges were dropped.|$|E

At a bluff east of the river, the entire Albany skyline comes into view as the road descends, passing the northern terminus of NY9J south of Rensselaer. Routes 9 and 20 then cross the Hudson River via the Dunn Memorial Bridge into Albany as Corning Tower and the other buildings of Empire State Plaza loom ahead, and the two routes separate, with 20 heading west across the city.|$|E
25|$|On 24 November 1989, Muhammad Azzam {{was driving}} {{his father and}} brother to Friday prayers in Peshawar, when unknown assassins detonated a bomb as the vehicle approached. Lying in a narrow street <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> gas station, the {{explosive}} had a 50-metre detonation cord {{which led to the}} sewerage system where the assailant presumably waited. According to Time magazine, Waheed Muzhda had noticed what he assumed was a crew doing routine road maintenance working on the culvert where the bomb was placed, the day before the assassination. Azzam and his sons were buried near the same site as his mother the year before, the Pabi Graveyard of the Shuhadaa' (martyrs), in Peshawar.|$|E

At the top, the car almost crashes into an oncoming semi-truck before swerving out of the way. [...] The car was now brought to the final test shown in the briefing room: the barrier test. The car lined up <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> barrier and began to accelerate towards it. [...] Just before hitting the barrier a series of flashes occurred, where {{a picture of the}} guests was taken, and the barrier opened to a track outside. The car took a lap around the building with banked turns and a max speed of 64.9mph (104.6km/h). [...] As the car returned to the loading dock, a thermal scan was taken of the guests and shown on a large screen.|$|E

In [...] "The Cost of Living", Eko awakens to find Yemi in his tent, telling him he needs to confess before finding [...] his tent is on fire. Searching for Yemi, he soon decides to follow Locke, Desmond, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Nikki and Paulo (Kiele Sanchez, and Rodrigo Santoro) to the Pearl station. While waiting outside, he sees Yemi again, and follows the {{apparition}} to give his confession. Upon learning it is merely a deception, Eko grows angry and chases Yemi into the jungle, where he confronts the [...] "Monster". After being thrown about by the Monster, Eko is finally thrown to the ground. Fatally wounded, he whispers [...] "I saw the Devil" [...] to Locke before dying, although Locke, for whatever reason, decides to tell Sayid he said, [...] "We're next." [...] As he dies, we see an image of Eko and Yemi as happy children, walking into the distance.

2500|$|The Luncheon on the Grass is the {{greatest}} work of Édouard Manet, {{one in which he}} realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural grandeur in a landscape. [...] We know the power with which he vanquished this difficulty. [...] There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two young men are seated <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> second woman who has just exited the water and who dries her naked skin in the open air. [...] This nude woman has scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas. [...] My God! [...] What indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men! [...] That has never been seen. [...] And this belief is a gross error, for in the Louvre there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of persons clothed and nude. [...] But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized. [...] The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging The Luncheon on the Grass like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a straightforward audience. [...] Painters, especially Édouard Manet, who is an analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists. [...] Thus, assuredly, the nude woman of The Luncheon on the Grass is only there to furnish the artist the occasion to paint a bit of flesh. [...] That which must be seen in the painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the background, an adorable dapple of white in the milieu of green leaves. [...] It is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, this corner of nature rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in him.|$|E
60|$|But, alas for the astute Jim's calculations! He {{drove on}} to the dairy, whose white walls now gleamed in the morning sun; made fast the horse to a ring in the wall, and entered the barton.

Since the unfortunate incident on the morning of the intended wedding they had merely been on nodding terms, from a sense of awkwardness in their relations.|$|E
60|$|In {{the palace}} where Goldoni {{was born a}} servant showed me an entirely new room near the roof, {{in which he said}} the great dramatist had {{composed}} his immortal comedies. As I knew, however, that Goldoni had left the house when a child, I could scarcely believe what the cicerone said, though I was glad he said it, and that he knew any thing at all of Goldoni. It is a fine old Gothic palace on a small canal near the Frari, and on the Calle del Nomboli, just <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> shop of indigestible pastry. It is known by an inscription, and by the medallion of the dramatist above the land- door; and there is no harm in looking in at the court on the ground-floor, where you may be pleased with the picturesque old stairway, wandering upward I hardly know how high, and adorned with many little heads of lions.|$|E

6000|$|... 1412. Amongst other results, I {{expected}} and sought for the mutual affection, {{or even the}} lateral coalition of two similar sparks, {{if they could be}} obtained simultaneously side by side, and sufficiently near to each other. For this purpose, two similar Leyden jars were supplied with rods of copper projecting from their balls in a horizontal direction, the rods being about 0.2 of an inch thick, and rounded at the ends. The jars were placed upon a sheet of tinfoil, and so adjusted that their rods, a and b, were near together, in the position represented in plan at fig. 116: c and d were two brass balls connected by a brass rod and insulated: e was also a brass ball connected, by a wire, with the ground and with the tinfoil upon which the Leyden jars were placed. By laying an insulated metal rod <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> to b, charging the jars, and removing the rod, both the jars could be brought up to the same intensity of charge (1370.). Then, making the ball e approach the ball d, at the moment the spark passed there, two sparks passed between the rods n, o, and the ball c; {{and as far as the}} eye could judge, or the conditions determine, they were simultaneous.|$|E
60|$|At {{another place}} two porters were engaged {{wheeling}} something in wheelbarrows <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> slip to the warehouse, stopping {{by the way}} at a little platform to have every wheelbarrow load weighed. One of the porters wheeled the loads from the ship to the platform, and the other, after they were weighed, wheeled them to the warehouse. At the platform sat {{a man with a}} little desk before him and a big book upon it, in which he entered the weight of each load as it came. As soon as the load was weighed the warehouse porter would take it from the platform, wheel it {{across the street to the}} warehouse, empty it there, and then bring back the empty wheelbarrow and set it down by the side of the platform. In the mean time the ship porter would have wheeled another load up to the platform from the ship, and by the time that the warehouse porter had come back, it would be weighed and all ready for him. The ship porter, when he brought the loaded wheelbarrow, would take back to the ship the empty one. The whole operation went on with so much regularity and system, and it worked so well in keeping all the men employed all the time, without either having to wait at all for the other, that it was a pleasure to witness it.|$|E
