It consists of a number of amendments to the Treaty on European Union ("Maastricht Treaty") and the Treaty establishing the European Community ("Treaty of Rome"), the latter renamed 'Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union' in the process. As amended by the Treaty of Lisbon, the Treaty on European Union provides a reference to the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights, making that document legally binding. The Treaty on European Union, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Charter of Fundamental rights thus have equal legal value and combined constitute the European Union's legal basis.|$|E

50|$|A {{case was}} brought against the UK {{government}} by Stuart Wheeler. Mr Wheeler claimed {{the government was}} legally bound by an election promise to hold {{a referendum on the}} Lisbon Treaty. The government asserted that the promise was no longer valid as it was the Constitutional Treaty for which a referendum was promised, and that the Lisbon Treaty was fundamentally different in content and in nature (being an <b>amending</b> <b>treaty</b> rather than a constitution). The court could not find anything unlawful in the government's ratification of the treaty and the case was rejected. The case was appealed but was once more rejected. During the period of the trial the government refrained from fully ratifying the treaty.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} ways an {{existing}} <b>treaty</b> can be <b>amended.</b> First, formal amendment requires State {{parties to the}} treaty {{to go through the}} ratification process all over again. The re-negotiation of treaty provisions can be long and protracted, and often some parties to the original treaty will not become parties to the <b>amended</b> <b>treaty.</b> When determining the legal obligations of states, one party to the original treaty and one a party to the <b>amended</b> <b>treaty,</b> the states will only be bound by the terms they both agreed upon. Treaties can also be amended informally by the treaty executive council when the changes are only procedural, technical change in customary international law can also <b>amend</b> a <b>treaty,</b> where state behavior evinces a new interpretation of the legal obligations under the treaty. Minor corrections to a treaty may be adopted by a procès-verbal; but a procès-verbal is generally reserved for changes to rectify obvious errors in the text adopted, i.e. where the text adopted does not correctly reflect the intention of the parties adopting it.|$|R

50|$|A {{proposed}} constitutional {{treaty was}} signed by plenipotentiaries from EU member states on 28 October 2004. The document was ratified in most member states, including two positive referendums. The referendums that were held in France and the Netherlands failed however, killing off the treaty. The European Council agreed that the constitution proposal would be abandoned, but most of its changes would be retained in an <b>amending</b> <b>treaty.</b> On 13 December 2007 the treaty was signed, containing opt-outs for the more eurosceptic members and no state-like elements. The Lisbon treaty finally came into force on 1 December 2009. It created the post of President of the European Council and significantly expanded the post of High Representative. After much debate {{about what kind of}} person should be President, the European Council agreed on a low-key personality and chose Herman Van Rompuy while foreign policy-novice Catherine Ashton became High Representative.|$|E

The Rt. Hon. Peter Hain M. P. kindly forwarded the Draft Constitutional Treaty to the Convention. However, the authors retained editorial control of the texts, and these were submitted to the Convention under their responsibility. There are three main texts: Each of the three main texts has an Introduction, and there is a Commentary on each of the Articles of Part One of the Draft Constitutional Treaty, and on certain of the Articles of the <b>Amending</b> <b>Treaty.</b> Some changes have been made to the Introductions and Commentaries, but the texts of the Draft Proclamation, the Draft Constitutional Treaty and the Draft <b>Amending</b> <b>Treaty</b> are those which have been submitted to the Convention...|$|E

40|$|The European Union is {{a rather}} new player in {{international}} relations. The European Union is neither a state nor international organization. With the accession to the European Union, the states transfer some attributes of sovereignty and, thus, the governing {{is done by the}} European Union mostly, taking part in its relations with third countries. At the same time, it contains some elements of the union (confederation, federation). Therefore, the European Union is more than an international organization. We find elements of the federation, confederation without being identified as such, being established on a system of organization. The European Union aims for integration of societies within a single economic, social, political, legal area. The European Union acts as a proper system based on an idea of creating strong Union bonds between the people of Europe, by establishing an internal market, an economical Union. The European Union, in its relations with the member states, keeps the ultimate goal that it has, being an international legal person, special competences, realizing common goals established with the member states. The legal basis of the European Union is represented by two treaties: the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The well-known Lisbon Treaty represents legally an <b>amending</b> <b>treaty</b> of the previous legal instruments - a compromise between the need for reform, on the one hand, and the need to live in a united Europe, on the other hand. The member states of the EU relate to two legal systems. As a result of their participation in an international organization with supranational character, Member States of the European Union assume a number of commitments with repercussions to their state sovereignty. The Member States coexist with the European Union. The European Union has become, along with its Member States, a matter of international law; even if it shows itself as a conglomerate of states - international organization; it is a union of states established by state attributes, an entity more complex and powerful, with a higher importance with its relations with the Member States, but also with an increased influence on international arena...|$|E
