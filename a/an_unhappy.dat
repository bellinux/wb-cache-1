By 1932, she had become the nation's best-known female reporter.|$|E
5|$|By most {{accounts}} Allen's first marriage was <b>an</b> <b>unhappy</b> one. His wife was rigidly religious, prone to criticizing him, and {{barely able to}} read and write. In contrast, Allen's behavior was sometimes quite flamboyant; and he maintained an interest in learning. In spite of these differences the marriage survived until Mary's death in 1783. Allen and Mary had five children together (Loraine, Joseph, Lucy, Mary, and Pamela), only two of whom reached adulthood.|$|E

5|$|The spell in Turkey, however, {{proved to}} be <b>an</b> <b>unhappy</b> time for Babangida and the Ankara side chose no to pursue their {{interest}} in the player once the loan deal expired. Looking for a move away from Netherlands, Babangida came close to signing with AJ Auxerre, but received a last-minute call from Ronald Koeman and agreed to join him at Vitesse instead. Another loan move followed. First team player under Koeman, Babangida subsequently lost {{his place in the}} starting line-up, when Ronald Koeman left for Ajax and was replaced by Edward Sturing.|$|E

5|$|Woodfull {{made his}} {{debut in the}} first Test at Trent Bridge, {{but it was an}} anti-climax; Australia did not bat in a washed-out match as England reached 0/32 when rain ended play. He failed to make an {{impression}} in the second Test at Lord's, scoring 13 and a duck in another drawn match. It capped off <b>an</b> <b>unhappy</b> June for Woodfull; he had scored only 120 runs at 13.33 for the month, with rain interruptions being frequent.|$|E
5|$|Bonifácio was {{dismissed}} {{from his position}} in December 1833 and replaced by another guardian. PedroII spent his days studying, with only two hours set aside for amusements. Intelligent, {{he was able to}} acquire knowledge with great ease. However, the hours of study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding. He had few friends of his age and limited contact with his sisters. All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave PedroII <b>an</b> <b>unhappy</b> and lonely upbringing. The environment in which he was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw books as a refuge and retreat from the real world.|$|E
5|$|Late one night, Ashley (Ashley Ryder)– a {{young man}} with a childlike mentality– arrives at the caravan home of his Uncle David (David Hoyle) on the Isle of Sheppey.

David lambasts the mother and society in general; the two embrace in a kiss before going to bed together.

5|$|Nigel Kneale {{wrote the}} first draft of the {{screenplay}} in 1961, but difficulties in attracting interest from American co-financiers meant the film did not go into production until 1967. The director, Roy Ward Baker, was chosen because of his experience with technically demanding productions such as A Night to Remember; this was the first of six films that he directed for Hammer. Andrew Keir, playing Quatermass, found making the film <b>an</b> <b>unhappy</b> experience, believing Baker had wanted Kenneth More to play the role. Owing to a lack of space, the film was shot at the MGM studios in Elstree, Borehamwood rather than Hammer's usual home at the time, which was the Associated British Studios, also in Elstree.|$|E
5|$|Through his father, Prince Dom João (later King Dom JoãoVI), Pedro was {{a member}} of the House of Braganza (Portuguese: Bragança) and a {{grandson}} of King Dom PedroIII and Queen Dona (Lady) MariaI of Portugal, who were uncle and niece as well as husband and wife. His mother, Doña Carlota Joaquina, was the daughter of King Don CarlosIV of Spain. Pedro's parents had <b>an</b> <b>unhappy</b> marriage. Carlota Joaquina was an ambitious woman, who always sought to advance Spain's interests, even to the detriment of Portugal's. Reputedly unfaithful to her husband, she went as far as to plot his overthrow in league with dissatisfied Portuguese nobles.|$|E
5|$|Disillusioned with Covent Garden, MacMillan {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} the Deutsche Oper in Berlin to run its ballet company. Parry describes this as <b>an</b> <b>unhappy</b> experience. Though at Covent Garden Webster may sometimes have been suspected of favouring the opera {{at the expense of}} the ballet, MacMillan discovered that at the Berlin house there was no doubt that the ballet was given distinctly lower priority. He did not speak German, which reduced his enjoyment from watching films (of which he was a great devotee) and theatre and limited him generally in everyday life. Although he had taken several colleagues with him, including Seymour, many moved away over the course of his nearly four years in charge, and MacMillan became increasingly isolated. It was the first time he had been in a managerial as well as a creative role, and the strain affected his physical and mental health. He smoked and drank heavily and suffered a minor stroke.|$|E

5|$|Eusebius' {{understanding}} of the Arab peoples is informed by his reading of the Bible and {{his knowledge of the}} history of imperial Rome. He {{does not appear to have}} personally known any Arabs. In his Chronicon, all the Arabs that appear—save for one reference to Ishmael—figure in the political history of the first three centuries of the Christian era. To Eusebius, the Saracens of the 4th century are direct-line descendants of the biblical Ishmaelites, descendants of the handmaid, Hagar, and the patriarch, Abraham. They are thus outcasts, beyond God's Covenant with the favored son of Abraham, Isaac. The twin images of the Ishmaelite and the Saracen—outcasts and latrones, raiders of the frontiers—reinforce each other and give Eusebius' portrait of the Arab nation <b>an</b> <b>unhappy</b> color. He may have been reluctant to associate the first Christian emperor with a people of such unfortunate ancestry.|$|E
5|$|In April 1972 {{her husband}} Casimiro died; {{he had never}} taken an {{interest}} in Wicca or esotericism and Valiente later claimed that theirs had been <b>an</b> <b>unhappy</b> relationship. Newly widowed, she soon had to move as the local council decided that her home was unfit for human habitation; she was relocated into council accommodation in the mid-1960s tower block of Tyson Place in Grosvenor Square, Brighton. Her flat was described by visitors as cramped, being filled with thousands of books. It was there that she met Ronald Cooke, {{a member of the}} apartment block's residents' committee; they entered into a relationship and she initiated him into Wicca, where he became her working partner. Together they regularly explored the Sussex countryside, and went on several holidays to Glastonbury, further considering moving there. She also joined a coven that was operating in the local area, Silver Malkin, after it was established by the Wiccan High Priestess Sally Griffyn.|$|E
