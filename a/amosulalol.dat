40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>amosulalol,</b> a newly {{synthesized}} sulphonamide-substituted phenylethylamine derivative, on electrical responses of smooth muscle {{cells of the}} guinea-pig vascular tissues to noradrenaline, isoprenaline and perivascular nerve stimulation were investigated. <b>Amosulalol</b> (10 (- 10) - 10 (- 5) M) did not alter the resting membrane potential of smooth muscle cells of the mesenteric artery, the mesenteric vein, the main pulmonary artery and the portal vein. In the mesenteric artery, main pulmonary artery and portal vein, {{but not in the}} mesenteric vein, membrane depolarizations produced by noradrenaline were antagonized by <b>amosulalol.</b> In the portal vein, membrane hyperpolarizations produced by isoprenaline were antagonized by <b>amosulalol.</b> In the mesenteric artery, <b>amosulalol</b> (over 10 (- 6) M) enhanced the amplitude of excitatory junction potentials (e. j. ps) produced by perivascular nerve stimulation. <b>Amosulalol</b> antagonized the noradrenaline-induced decrease in the e. j. p. amplitude; this effect was much weaker than that of phentolamine. <b>Amosulalol</b> also antagonized the isoprenaline-induced enhancement of the e. j. p. amplitude. In the mesenteric vein, the slow depolarizations produced by perivascular nerve stimulation were depressed by <b>amosulalol</b> (over 10 (- 6) M), but the effect was much weaker than that of prazosin, yohimbine or phentolamine. Actions of <b>amosulalol</b> on electrical properties of vascular tissues can be summarized as follows: <b>amosulalol</b> blocks alpha 1 - and beta-adrenoceptors. It also blocks alpha 2 -adrenoceptors, though weakly...|$|E
40|$|Haemodynamically, the {{combination}} of alpha 1 - and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists is a logical one. alpha 1 -Adrenoceptor blockade causes vasodilatation and hence counteracts elevated peripheral vascular resistance, the most consistent haemodynamic derangement in established essential hypertension. beta-Blockers, which lower elevated blood pressure by a different (not yet clearly understood) mechanism, suppress the reflex tachycardia triggered by vasodilatation. Combined alpha/beta-adrenoceptor blockade {{can be obtained by}} the simultaneous administration of both types of adrenoceptor antagonists, but also by giving drugs that possess alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity in the same molecule. Carvedilol and labetalol are the best known examples of such combined alpha/beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, although their pharmacodynamic profile is a result of different receptor selectivity of their component stereoisomers, rather than combined alpha/beta-blocking activity in a single chemical entity. Both compounds have been investigated clinically in the treatment of essential hypertension in moderate-to-large scale trials. A few newer combined alpha/beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as <b>amosulalol,</b> arotinolol and medroxalol have been developed, but clinical data on these compounds are relatively scarc...|$|E
