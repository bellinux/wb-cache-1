40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{evaluates the}} {{possible}} vulnerabilities of ICT <b>assets</b> <b>disposal</b> {{policies and the}} associated impact that can affect the SMEs. A poorly implemented policy or unenforced policy is “potentially the weakest link ” in the cyber-security chain. Do SMEs {{have an idea of}} vulnerabilities or threats due to <b>assets</b> <b>disposal?</b> In the event of breaches, the SMEs pay for the cost of notifying the concerned stakeholders, compensate affected parties, invest in improved mitigation technologies and also may be subjected to unwarranted public scrutiny. ICT assets at the end-of-useful life span usually have data left on the hard disk drives or storage media, which is a source of data confidentiality vulnerability. SMEs were surveyed in developing economies on their <b>assets</b> <b>disposal</b> policies. The perceived correlations were analyzed using fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) to ascertain if any cyber-security vulnerabilities inherent in a particular policy have implications on others. The study endeavored to show that, SMEs ought to have appropriate <b>assets</b> <b>disposal</b> policies in place. Then, these policies ought to be signed off by all stakeholders as a matter of responsibility. By employing the FCM approach with fuzzy matrix operations, the results indicate positive correlations exist amongst the policy constructs. Thus, vulnerabilities with one policy have implications on others...|$|R

2500|$|Li's {{business}} empire has presence {{around the}} world, including China. Li {{came under attack}} from Global Times in early 2015, when his companies put out word that it was considering selling prime Shanghai and Beijing properties. It became apparent that Li aimed at re-weighting his asset portfolio to more stable and transparent markets in the West. Concerted attacks ensued and went into a crescendo as China's economy slowed down dramatically in the second half, and the central government sought a way to stem the capital outflows. Specific reproaches were that his <b>asset</b> <b>disposals</b> were [...] "an act of ingratitude" [...] and [...] "immoral at such a sensitive juncture". Security Times, a People's Daily publication, estimated that Li has sold at least 73.8billion yuan worth of assets since 2014. Li's holding companies denied divesting in China, saying that its <b>asset</b> <b>disposals</b> were being undertaken in the ordinary course of business. The attacks stopped abruptly several weeks later, when editorials in official publications such as People's Daily, Beijing Youth Daily took a neutral stance in unison.|$|R

50|$|The first Skyfox {{converted}} was an ex-Canadian Forces CT-133, the Canadian license-built {{equivalent of}} the T-33 which were formerly a Silver Star 3AT (Armament Trainer). This particular aircraft, produced in 1958, had construction number T.33-160 and serial number RCAF21160. It was struck-off charge on 10 November 1970 and was sold through Crown <b>Assets</b> <b>Disposal</b> Corporation to Leroy Penhall/Fighter Imports in 1973.

50|$|The year 1982 saw the {{property}} market in Hong Kong plunge dramatically, {{and in the}} following two years rentals halved.

Hongkong Land sold its international properties as well as its non-core assets in Hong Kong, including its interests in Hong Kong Telephone and Hong Kong Electric. But its core assets in the heart of Central were left untouched.|$|R
50|$|The airline {{embarked}} upon a major <b>asset</b> <b>disposal</b> programme {{to compensate}} for this significant revenue loss and to have sufficient funds to keep the business running.

50|$|Following the {{election}} of the Thatcher government in 1979, and the deteriorating economic situation, pressure was put on nationalised industries such as British Rail to consider <b>asset</b> <b>disposal.</b> It was not long before the BTH Hotels were under review. The management at the time, led by Peter Land, tried to establish a viable structure for a management buyout, which would have kept the group more or less intact and would have delivered a smooth transfer to the private sector. As Peter Land notes in his book Sauce Supreme, politics rendered this plan impossible and the hotels were sold by open tender, realising a much lower value for the UK taxpayer than the management buyout would have done. By 1984 the disposal was complete and the history of BTH was at an end.|$|E
