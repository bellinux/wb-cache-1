5000|$|In <b>attribute-based</b> {{access control}} (ABAC), access is granted {{not based on}} the rights of the subject {{associated}} with a user after authentication, but based on attributes of the user. The user has to prove so-called claims about his attributes to the access control engine. An <b>attribute-based</b> access control policy specifies which claims need to be satisfied in order to grant access to an object. For instance the claim could be [...] "older than 18". Any user that can prove this claim is granted access. Users can be anonymous when authentication and identification are not strictly required. One does, however, require means for proving claims anonymously. This can for instance be achieved using anonymous credentials. XACML (extensible access control markup language) is a standard for <b>attribute-based</b> access control. XACML 3.0 was standardized in January 2013.|$|E
50|$|<b>Attribute-based</b> {{access control}} is {{sometimes}} referred to as policy-based access control (PBAC) or claims-based access control (CBAC), which is a Microsoft-specific term.|$|E
5000|$|Object <b>Attribute-based</b> methods search {{a measure}} of {{similarity}} between the gray-level and the binarized images, such as fuzzy shape similarity, edge coincidence, etc.|$|E
50|$|<b>Attribute-based</b> {{access control}} {{can also be}} applied to Big Data systems like Hadoop. Policies {{similar to those used}} {{previously}} can be applied when retrieving data from data lakes.|$|E
5000|$|The default MEF {{composable}} part implementation uses <b>attribute-based</b> metadata {{to declare}} exports and imports. This allows MEF {{to determine which}} parts, imports, and exports are available through discovery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Attribute-based</b> {{encryption}} {{is a type}} of public-key encryption {{in which}} the secret key of a user and the ciphertext are dependent upon attributes (e.g. the country in which he lives, or the kind of subscription he has). In such a system, the decryption of a ciphertext is possible only if the set of attributes of the user key matches the attributes of the ciphertext.A crucial security aspect of <b>Attribute-Based</b> Encryption is collusion-resistance: An adversary that holds multiple keys should only be able to access data if at least one individual key grants access.|$|E

50|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{an evolving}} paradigm with tremendous momentum, but its unique aspects exacerbate security and privacy challenges. Heterogeneity {{and diversity of}} cloud services and environments demand fine-grained access control policies and services that should be flexible enough to capture dynamic, context, or <b>attribute-based</b> access requirements and data protection.|$|E
50|$|The Distributed Access Control System (DACS)is a {{light-weight}} {{single sign-on}} and <b>attribute-based</b> {{access control system}} for web servers and server-based software. DACS is primarily used with Apache web servers to provide enhanced access control for web pages, CGI programs and servlets, and other web-based assets, and to federateApache servers.|$|E
50|$|Scalable {{distributed}} systems demand {{an ability to}} express and adapt to diverse policies of numerous distinct administrative domains. The lab introduced technologies for messaging systems with adaptive security policies based on WSEmail, where Internet messaging is implemented as a web service, and <b>Attribute-Based</b> Messaging (ABM), where addressing is based on attributes of recipients.|$|E
50|$|The {{differences}} between Fortran, C, and even Java, although considerable, are ultimately constrained by all three being {{based on the}} programming style of the von Neumann computer. If, for example, Java objects were all executed in parallel with asynchronous message passing and <b>attribute-based</b> declarative addressing, then Java {{would not be in}} the group.|$|E
5000|$|Where OAuth {{focuses on}} {{delegated}} access (I, the user, grant Twitter access to my Facebook wall), and identity-centric authorization, XACML takes an <b>attribute-based</b> approach which can consider {{attributes of the}} user, the action, the resource, and the context (who, what, where, when, how). With XACML {{it is possible to}} define policies such as ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Attribute-based</b> {{encryption}} (ABE) can be {{used for}} log encryption. Instead of encrypting each part of a log with the keys of all recipients, it is possible to encrypt the log only with attributes which match recipients' attributes. This primitive can also be used for broadcast encryption in order to decrease the number of keys used.|$|E
5000|$|Functional {{encryption}} generalizes several existing primitives including Identity-based encryption (IBE) and <b>Attribute-based</b> encryption (ABE).In the IBE case, define [...] to {{be equal}} to [...] when [...] corresponds to an identity that is allowed to decrypt, and [...] otherwise.Similarly, in the ABE case, define [...] when [...] encodes attributes with permission to decrypt and [...] otherwise.|$|E
50|$|The {{denial of}} human nature {{attributes}} lead to an <b>attribute-based</b> dehumanization process which separates the outgroup from human characteristics involving emotions, therefore likening them to inanimate objects. This process {{is referred to as}} mechanistic dehumanization. By denying the out group human nature attributes they are perceived as robotic and unemotional, leading the ingroup to be less empathetic towards them.|$|E
50|$|ORM is attribute-free: unlike {{models in}} the {{entity-relationship}} (ER) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) methods, ORM treats all elementary facts as relationships and so treats decisions for grouping facts into structures (e.g. <b>attribute-based</b> entity types, classes, relation schemes, XML schemas) as implementation concerns irrelevant to semantics. By avoiding attributes in the base model, ORM improves semantic stability and enables verbalization into natural language.|$|E
50|$|DACS {{performs}} {{access control}} by evaluating access control rules that are specified by an administrator.Expressed {{as a set}} of XML documents, the rules are consulted at run-time to determinewhether access to a given resource should be granted or denied.As access control rules can be arbitrary computations, itcombines <b>attribute-based</b> access control, role-based access control,policy-based access control, delegated access control, and other approaches.The architecture provides many possibilities to administrators.|$|E
5000|$|Revocation {{of users}} in cryptosystems {{is a well}} studied but nontrivial problem. Revocation is even more {{challenging}} in <b>attribute-based</b> systems, given that each attribute possibly belongs to multiple diﬀerent users, whereas in traditional PKI systems public/private key pairs are uniquely associated with a single user. In principle, in an ABE system, attributes, not users or keys, are revoked. The following paragraph now discusses how the revocation feature can be incorporated.|$|E
5000|$|The Firefox XForms {{extension}} {{was part}} of the Mozilla Project. XForms 1.0 SE support is not complete but covers most of the specification with a notable exception of <b>attribute-based</b> repeating used in HTML tables. The extension was available for both Firefox 2 and Firefox 3, but is not upgraded to support Firefox 4 and higher. In July 2011 the lead developer wrote that XForms support would no longer get updated. Support for XForms was eventually deprecated in Firefox 19.|$|E
