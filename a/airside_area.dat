5|$|Gordon Ramsay Plane Food is a {{restaurant}} owned by chef Gordon Ramsay and located within Terminal 5 of Heathrow Airport, London. The restaurant cost £2.5 {{million to build}} and due to its location within the <b>airside</b> <b>area</b> of the airport, there are restrictions {{on the use of}} gas and the types of cutlery which may be used. It opened in 2008 alongside the rest of Terminal 5, and with several other Ramsay-related openings that year. Ramsay said that he aimed to keep the menu lean without the use of heavy sauces, and menus are also offered for quick dining as well as takeaway cool boxes which contain a three course meal to be eaten on a plane.|$|E
2500|$|Terminal A is a hexagon-shaped ring {{concourse}} with {{a parking}} area, taxi stands and bus stops in its middle. It features 14 jet bridges which correspond to 16 respective check-in counters (A00–A15), with jetways 1 and 14 each serving two check-in counters. There is no transit zone, {{which means that}} each gate has its own security clearance checkpoint and exit for arriving passengers. Therefore, direct flight connections without leaving the <b>airside</b> <b>area</b> are not possible. Most major airlines arrive and depart here, especially [...] "prestigious" [...] flights like intercontinental services or flights to the busy European hub airports; for example United Airlines flights to Newark and Lufthansa services to Munich are handled here. The whole rooftop works as a visitor platform. Terminal A is capable of handling wide-bodied aircraft like the Boeing 767 or Airbus A330 on two positions but with only one jet bridge attached to each.|$|E
2500|$|Much {{has been}} made of Wallace's fondness for the colour pink. Shortly after being elected, while {{referring}} to Mary Mitchell O'Connor in Dáil Éireann, he said [...] "Miss Piggy has toned it down a bit today". He accepted full responsibility and later apologised, saying [...] "It was my fault. I passed the reference because of her handbag. I'm completely out of order. I don't have a leg to stand on [...] Clearly it was in bad taste." [...] He called Mitchell O'Connor to apologise and said he would write a letter of apology to her as well. In reference to his fondness for pink, Wallace dyed his hair that colour to raise awareness of cancer in February 2015. Since being elected to the Dáil {{together for the first time}} in 2011, Wallace and Dublin North TD Clare Daly have become friends and political allies, and have worked together on many campaigns, including opposition to austerity and revelations of various alleged Garda malpractices, including harassment, cancellation of penalty points in questionable circumstances and involvement of officers in the drug trade. In July 2014 they were both arrested at Shannon Airport while trying to inspect a military aircraft. Wallace said, [...] "All we wanted to do was confirm whether we are being told the truth." [...] Wallace was fined €2,000 for being in an <b>airside</b> <b>area</b> without permission, and chose not to pay. He was sentenced to 30 days in prison in default, and in December 2015 was arrested for non-payment of the fine.|$|E
50|$|Airports {{are divided}} into {{landside}} and <b>airside</b> <b>areas.</b> Landside areas include parking lots, public transportation train stations and access roads. <b>Airside</b> <b>areas</b> include all areas accessible to aircraft, including runways, taxiways and aprons. Access from landside <b>areas</b> to <b>airside</b> <b>areas</b> is tightly controlled at most airports. Passengers on commercial flights access <b>airside</b> <b>areas</b> through terminals, where they can purchase tickets, clear security check, or claim luggage and board aircraft through gates. The waiting areas which provide passenger access to aircraft are typically called concourses, although this term is often used interchangeably with terminal.|$|R

5000|$|There {{have been}} two similar severe {{security}} breaches {{at the airport in}} March and May 2016. In March 2016, an off-duty police officer entered the <b>airside</b> <b>area</b> in Terminal 2 after bypassing the security screening. In May 2016, a tourist entered the Terminal 1 <b>airside</b> <b>area</b> without clearing security as well. In both cases, the Terminal had to be shut down until the intruder was found which severely disrupted flight operations.|$|E

50|$|Airports {{are divided}} into {{landside}} and <b>airside.</b> Landside includes <b>areas</b> such as check-in, parking lots, public transport railway stations and access roads. <b>Airside</b> includes all <b>areas</b> accessible to aircraft, including runways, taxiways and apron/ramps. Passage between landside and airside is tightly controlled at all airports. To access airside, one must go through Security, and if applicable, Passport Control too. This applies to everyone, including staff.|$|R
50|$|Runway 13 is {{equipped}} with an approach lighting system called Precision Approach Lighting Category 1, whereas runway 31 with Simple Approach Lighting System. The other <b>airside</b> <b>areas</b> such as the taxiways (‘A’ and ‘B’) and apron are also furnished with appropriate lighting aids. The maximum capacity of the parking apron is one Airbus, two Boeing 737-400s, two Fokker 50 and two Twin Otter or similar aircraft. Only bay 2 and 3 are equipped with aerobridges functioning on Visual Docking and Guidance System. The functional runway is also equipped with landing aids such as the Middle Marker (MM), Glide Path (GP), the Localizer (LLZ) and the PAPI. All the stated instruments are installed to be utilized by aircraft to assist them during the final approach process and landing manoeuvres.|$|R

50|$|Stuttgart Airport {{consists}} of four passenger terminals which have separate check-in facilities and entrances but are directly connected {{to each other and}} share a single <b>airside</b> <b>area</b> which features eight Jet bridges as well as about two dozen bus-boarding stands.|$|E
5000|$|Work on {{the third}} phase was {{intended}} to accommodate 5 million passenger movements annually and was started in 2007. The third phase involved the commissioning of a central block, connecting the domestic and international terminals and enlarging the <b>airside</b> <b>area</b> to accommodate more gates and waiting areas along with increased shopping areas. This increased the built-up area by another 29700 m2. The <b>airside</b> <b>area</b> of the international arrivals and departures blocks were integrated and glass walls were installed to allow for more natural light. The runway was re-surfaced in 2008. The number of parking areas were increased from 15 to 24, including three dedicated for cargo airlines. The third phase also completed {{the expansion of the}} cargo village and a second aircraft taxi-way to the MRO facility.|$|E
5000|$|Terminal 1 is {{the main}} {{building}} features 26 check-in desks, several service counters, some shops and restaurants and a visitors terrace. The <b>airside</b> <b>area</b> consists of 9 boarding gates {{which can be used}} for Schengen and non-Schengen destinations. As there are no jet bridges, walk- and bus-boarding is used.|$|E
5000|$|A {{vertical}} {{garden was}} constructed in the terminals {{at a cost of}} [...] 400 million. The garden has about 40 different varieties of plants. The garden is visible from the terminals and also the connecting tube that links the landside to the <b>airside</b> (the <b>area</b> closer to the runway). The garden is watered using the drip irrigation method.|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} {{of the effects of}} land-use activities on atmospherically-derived pollutant loadings in stormwater is helpful for determining appropriate treatment strategies for different catchments. Impervious concrete boards (≈ 1 m 2) were deployed for eleven months in different land-use areas (industrial, residential and airside of an airport’s runway) throughout Christchurch, New Zealand, to determine the spatial variability of atmospherically-derived pollutants in stormwater runoff. Runoff was analysed for metals (principally Cu, Zn, and Pb) and total suspended solids (TSS). All three land-use areas exhibited similar temporal patterns of varying metal and TSS loads, indicating that atmospherically-deposited metals and TSS had a homogenous distribution within the Christchurch airshed. However, mean pollutant loadings for all total metals and TSS were significantly higher in the industrial area compared to the residential and <b>airside</b> <b>areas,</b> which had statistically similar mean metal loadings. The signature ratios of specific heavy metals (As, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, and Zn) to Cu were relatively homogeneous between the three land-use areas, indicating that the pollutants originate from a similar source and that surrounding land-use was not as an important factor in determining atmospheric pollutant loadings to stormwater runoff as previously though...|$|R
25|$|Terminal 3, {{which opened}} on 28 October 2004, {{replaced}} Terminal 1 {{as the main}} international gateway to and from Israel. The building was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM). Moshe Safdie & Associates and TRA (now Black and Veatch) designed a linking structure and the <b>airside</b> departure <b>areas</b> and gates. Ram Karmi and other Israeli architects were the local architects of record. The inaugural flight was an El Al flight to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City.|$|R
50|$|Hannover Airport {{has three}} {{passenger}} terminal concourses named Terminals A, B, and C.
