5|$|Completion of {{the station}} {{buildings}} was delayed for many years. Designed by the architect Charles Holden, the pre-war plans included a large entrance building <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill next to The Woodman public house {{with a pair of}} escalators between the entrance and the sub-surface concourse. These were to be enclosed in an inclined structure {{down the side of the}} cutting parallel with the surface tracks. Taking inspiration from the local legend, the building would have been topped by a statue of Dick Whittington and his cat.

30|$|Through {{the above}} analysis, the deep {{potential}} well is only formed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> channel under Gate 2 after writing “ 1 ”. Therefore, in the channel region under Gate 2, <b>the</b> energy band <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> channel {{is much higher}} than that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom of channel. This demonstrates {{that there will be a}} barrier <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> channel under Gate 2 during the reading “ 1 ”. The inset of Fig. 8 b plots <b>the</b> energy band <b>at</b> both <b>the</b> <b>top</b> and bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> channel after reading “ 1 ”. It can be clearly found that a higher channel barrier exists between Gate 1 and Gate 2 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> channel, but this barrier does not exist <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom of channel. Therefore, the conduction path is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> channel under Gate 1 and the bottom of channel under Gate 2 during the reading “ 1 ”, which can be clearly demonstrated by the current density in Fig. 8.|$|R
