What drives many, {{many players}} to distraction is {{the unpredictability of}} the cueball's path of travel...the game of billiards requires you to drive a ball someplace; pool, in any form, mostly <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> stop a ball someplace. In either case, you'll fare much better when you understand the how and why of a ball's getting {{from one place to}} another.|$|E
2500|$|Kindred {{has been}} a {{consistent}} text choice for {{high school and college}} courses throughout the years. Linell Smith of The Baltimore Sun describes it as [...] "a celebrated mainstay of college courses in women's studies and black literature and culture." [...] Speaking at the occasion of the reissue of Kindred for its 25th Anniversary by Beacon Press, African-American literature professor Roland L. Williams conjectured that the novel has remained popular over the years because of its crossover appeal, which [...] "continues to find a variety of audiences--fantasy, literary and historical" [...] and because [...] "it is an exceedingly well-written and compelling story… that <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> look back in time and at the present simultaneously." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clinton was {{conflicted}} {{whether she}} {{wanted to take the}} position or remain in the Senate, and agonized over her decision. While the Senate leadership had discussed possible leadership positions or other promotions in rank with her even before the cabinet position became a possibility, nothing concrete had been offered. The prospect of her ever becoming Senate Majority Leader seemed dim. A different complication was Bill Clinton; she told Obama: [...] "There's one last thing that's a problem, which is my husband. You've seen what this is like; it will be a circus if I take this job", making reference to the volatile effect Bill Clinton had had during the primaries. In addition, there was a specific concern whether the financial and other involvements of Bill Clinton's post-presidential activities would violate any conflict-of-interest rules for serving cabinet members. There was as well considerable media speculation about what effect taking the position would have on her political career and any possible future presidential aspirations. Clinton wavered over the offer, but as she later related, [...] "But, you know, we kept talking. I finally began thinking, look, if I had won and I had called him, I would have wanted him to say yes. And, you know, I'm pretty old-fashioned, and it's just who I am. So {{at the end of the}} day, when your president <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> serve, you say yes, if you can." [...] Chief of Protocol of the United States Capricia Penavic Marshall, who had known Clinton since her First Lady days, later confirmed the same rationale: [...] "When asked to serve, she does. And her president asked." ...|$|E

"Granville," [...] he said slowly, like {{a broken}} man, [...] "I don't <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> forgive me; <b>you</b> can never forgive me; I don't <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> sympathise with me; a father knows better than to accept sympathy from a son; but I do <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> bear with me while I try to explain myself." ...|$|R

2500|$|Don McKellar {{said about}} {{adapting}} the story, [...] "None {{of the characters}} even have names or a history, which is very untraditional for a Hollywood story. The film, like the novel, directly addresses sight and {{point of view and}} <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> see things from a different perspective." [...] McKellar wrote the script so audiences would see the world {{through the eyes of the}} protagonist, the doctor's wife. He sought to have them question the humanity of how she observes but does not act in various situations, including a rape scene. He consulted Saramago about why the wife took so long to act. McKellar noted, [...] "He said she became aware of the responsibility that comes with seeing gradually, first to herself, then to her husband, then to her small family, then her ward, and finally to the world where she has to create a new civilization." [...] The screenwriter wrote out the [...] "actions and circumstances" [...] that would allow the wife to find her responsibility. While the completed script was mostly faithful to the novel, McKellar went through several drafts that were not. One such saw him veer away from the novel by creating names and backstories for all the characters. Another significantly changed the chronology. Only after these abortive attempts did McKellar decide to cut the backstories and focus primarily on the doctor and his wife. He attempted to reconnect with what originally drew him to the novel: what he called its [...] "existential simplicity". The novel defines its characters by little more than their present actions; doing the same for the adaptation became [...] "an interesting exercise" [...] for McKellar.|$|E
