500|$|During the {{development}} of the series' pilot chapter, Rurouni, Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story, Watsuki and his editor argued over Kenshin's speech patterns, settling for a [...] "slangy" [...] one. For {{the final version of the}} first Romantic Story, Watsuki adjusted the dialogue; in his view, he made Kenshin sound [...] "more as I prefer him now". Nevertheless, Kenshin was concerned about how Kenshin's manner abruptly changed when facing his opponent. Watsuki added Kenshin's trademark [...] as a placeholder to be an expression of the English speech disfluency [...] "huh". Watsuki notes that he was surprised at how well it caught on, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>he</b> ended up having Kenshin use the sound during the series. Watsuki also planned to make Kenshin more 30 years old; his editor commented that it was strange that the main character of a manga for teenagers to be of such an age, so he instead made him 28 years old.|$|E
500|$|Virginia's {{death had}} a {{significant}} effect on Poe. After her death, Poe was deeply saddened for several months. A friend said of him, [...] "the loss of his wife was a sad blow to him.

While Virginia was still struggling to recover, Poe turned to alcohol after abstaining for quite some time. How often <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>he</b> drank is a controversial issue, debated in Poe's lifetime and also by modern biographers. Poe referred to his emotional response to his wife's sickness as his own illness, and that he found the cure to it [...] "in the death of my wife.

2500|$|Diophantus' {{work has}} had a large {{influence}} in history. Editions of [...] Arithmetica exerted a profound influence {{on the development of}} algebra in Europe in the late sixteenth and through the 17th and 18th centuries. [...] Diophantus and his works have also influenced Arab mathematics and were of great fame among Arab mathematicians. Diophantus' work created a foundation for work on algebra and in fact much of advanced mathematics is based on algebra.

The siy̓ám̓ has been described as [...] "...the best talker – not chairman, (our people) have no chairman – but man who says the most wise things". The siy̓ám̓ was usually chosen by factors which included his status and respect within the community, the village and other indigenous nations, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>he</b> exemplified the characteristics of a noble person, such as humility, respect, generosity, and wisdom.|$|E

Stryker, an Episcopalian minister at St. Barnabas Church in Baltimore and a Confederate sympathizer, and the Reverend Doctor Abram Dunn Gillette, a loyal Unionist and pastor at the First Baptist Church in Washington, D.C. [...] Gillette arrived shortly after Powell made his request. [...] Powell spent several hours with Gillette, whom he had seen preach in Baltimore in February 1865.

2500|$|As the Doctor accidentally did {{not return}} for her until twelve years later, Amy grew up a {{different}} person than she would have. She had become [...] "cynical" [...] and [...] "distrustful" [...] as the Doctor {{did not return}} as he had promised and {{she was forced to}} believe he was just an imaginary friend, and had resorted to being [...] "tough". Moffat theorised that Amy would have taken her anger out on Rory and would have been [...] "mean" [...] about things such as Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy. The second episode, [...] "The Beast Below", was to introduce Amy into the role of the Doctor's companion <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>he</b> needed one. Though Amy soon tries to seduce the Doctor, Moffat believed that it was consistent with the cynical character he had built up. It was also a reflection of how the two had just escaped from death and shared a hard time together, and Amy's tendency to do things [...] "in the heat of the moment". In [...] "Amy's Choice", meant to challenge the Doctor and Amy's relationship, Rory dies in an alternate universe that was a result of psychic pollen that had entered the TARDIS. This is when Amy truly realises her feelings for Rory. As a primary part of the series' story arc, Rory officially dies and is erased from history and Amy's memory. Though Rory later returns, he is an Auton duplicate who kills her, which reflected Moffat's belief that all good love stories end in tragedy. The end of [...] "The Big Bang", in which Amy stands up at her wedding and declares the Doctor is real, was the Doctor's success at restoring Amy to the spirit of the girl he first met.|$|E
